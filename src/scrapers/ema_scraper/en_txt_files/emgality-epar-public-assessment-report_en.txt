2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Among primary headaches, defined as independent disorders not caused by another disease or trauma 
(ICHD, 2nd ed., 2004) and that include also tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias 
and other primary headache disorders, migraine is very common and has two major subtypes based on 
specific features and symptoms that accompany each attack: migraine without aura (the most frequent 
form) and migraine with aura, in which transient focal neurological symptoms usually precede or 
sometimes accompany the headache. There are trigger factors that include hypo-hyper activity, hunger, 
sleep deprivation, exposure to intense or pulsatile light, depressed mood, cravings for particular foods, 
repetitive yawning, fatigue and neck stiffness and/or pain which migraineurs experience hours or even 
days before the headache, or during its resolution. Migraine without aura is the commonest form of 
primary headaches. Headache typically is recurrent and lasts 4 to 72 hours, has unilateral location, 
pulsating quality, moderate to severe intensity and aggravated with routine activity, associated or not to 
nausea, phono- or photophobia. Migraine with aura needs the coexistence of fully reversible aura 
symptoms spreading over at least 5 minutes with 5 to 60 minutes duration and followed by headache. In 
the early stage of an attack, the accompanying premonitory symptoms may be associated with 
hypothalamic involvement (Maniyar FH, 2014). 
Migraine is a complex and multifaceted brain disorder and two main categories can be identified, based 
mainly on the frequency of attacks: episodic migraine (EM), defined as less than 15 headache days per 
month and chronic migraine (CM), defined as the patient having 15 or more headache days per month, 
with at least five attacks fulfilling criteria for EM with or without aura. However, there is a substantial 
overlap in terms of symptoms between the two forms, as well as pathophysiology and burden of disability, 
which make preventive treatment one of the key strategies for migraine management. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Including both EM and CM, migraine has a one-year prevalence of 15-18% worldwide, with extensive 
financial yearly burden on global economies, ranging from $19.6 in the United States to €27 billion in the 
European Union. It was ranked as the third most prevalent disorder and sixth-highest specific cause of 
disability worldwide by the WHO (Global Burden of Disease Study, 2013). 
Migraine predominantly affects females with a 3:1 ratio, with a peak of incidence between the ages of 25 
to 55 years, thus it may profoundly impact upon quality of life and productivity. In fact, due to the 
neurological deficits experienced in the acute phase (such as nausea, vomiting, light and/or sound 
sensitivity, need to be isolated from the outer world including workplace and school), as well as the 
aftermath following an attack that lasts for hours or days, subjects experience a condition of true 
restrictive lifestyle.  The vast majority (approximately 90%) of migraine sufferers have a reduced ability 
to function, and one-third require bed rest during migraine attacks (Lipton et al. 2007). 
Migraine has a significant impact on the population, as each year, about 2.5 % of patients with EM 
develop new-onset CM (Manack et al., 2011). Demographic and comorbidity data outline some clinical 
differences among subjects with CM and EM, being EM patients more frequently overweight and younger, 
CHMP assessment report

unemployed and with and anxious-depressed mood (Blumenfield et al 2010), whereas in several CM 
patients there are risk factors like medications abuse as well as different response to treatments, both 
preventive and abortive.   
Comorbidities of migraines include, but are not limited to, psychiatric and medical conditions such as 
depression and vascular disorders (Buse et al, 2010; Bigal et al, 2009).   
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Over the past two decades, new theories apart from the classical neurovascular theory, have tried to 
elucidate the pathogenesis of migraine while focusing on activation of the trigeminovascular system 
(Goadsby et al., 2002), cortical hyperexcitability (Coppola wt al., 2002), and dysregulation of brainstem 
regions involved in antinociception and vascular control.  The so called trigeminal durovascular afferent 
pathway has undergone in-depth analyses through immunohistochemistry and functional brain imaging, 
starting from the knowledge that pain-sensitive structures such as the intracranial blood vessels and the 
meninges, especially the dura mater, are supplied with sensory nerve fibres (Pietrobon & Striessnig, 
2003) by the ophthalmic ramus of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. They arise from 
pseudounipolar neurons located in the trigeminal ganglion (Link et al., 2008) projecting onto second 
order sensory neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brain stem and its related extensions 
down to the C2-level called the trigeminocervical complex (Goadsby, 2007).   
In light of this, several experiments have tried to elucidate the details behind each of the four phases in 
which a migraine attack is classically subdivided: the premonitory, aura, headache, and postdrome 
phases. There is wide consensus over the notion that migraine attacks are the results of a cyclic disorder 
of brain sensory processing, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The premonitory 
phase involves brain stem and diencephalic systems that modulate afferent signals and explain 
photophobia or phonophobia, followed by pain up to the resolution or postdromal phase. A dysfunction of 
central pain processing in the interictal state has been gathered from the hypometabolism of central pain 
processing areas including bilateral insula, bilateral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, left premotor 
and prefrontal cortex, and left primary somatosensory cortex as revealed by 18F-FDG and BOLD-fMRI 
imaging studies.  
The major classes of medicines identified thus far, such as triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor 
agonists, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) modulators, including receptor antagonists and 
monoclonal antibodies, gepants, ditans, 5-HT1F receptor agonists glurants, mGlu5 modulators would 
exert their main effect at this stage of the whole process. 
With regard to CGRP, this neuropeptide is abundant in perivascular trigeminal nerve fibres by which is 
activated, especially during migraine attacks, and shows the capability of dilating intracranial and 
extracranial blood vessels while modulating vascular nociception at central level. As such, CGRP may play 
an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine and, conversely, blockade of CGRP receptors as well 
as its own peripheral circulation may contribute to abort migraine. 
Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been associated with migraine (Edvinsson and Goadsby 
1994; Bigal et al. 2013). In addition, CGRP infusions can induce migraine-like attacks in individuals with 
a history of migraine (Lassen et al. 2002; Hansen et al. 2010). 
CGRP peptide can directly exert excitatory effects on nociceptive neurons leading to sensitisation or 
activation of neurons in pain signalling pathways, suggesting that can it can drive maladaptive processes 
in peripheral nerves that induce peripheral sensitisation and ultimately pain. It can also facilitate the 
effects of other pain transmitters including glutamate and substance P (Ma et al. 2010). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 8/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rationale in using CGRP mAbs stands behind the possibility to target smooth muscle cells on blood 
vessels and neurons and glial cells outside the blood–brain barrier, contributing to halt vasodilation, mast 
cell degranulation, neurogenic inflammation, and possibly peripheral pain sensitization in migraine 
(Russel FA et al, 2014). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Migraine is a chronic condition, albeit prolonged remissions are frequently observed.  The diagnosis of 
migraine is based on patient history and follows the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic 
criteria  
According to the definition of common migraine (migraine without aura or hemicrania simplex, coded with 
1.1 in the ICHD-3 beta) patients must have at least 5 recurrent attacks lasting 4-72 hours (untreated or 
unsuccessfully treated) and the headache must have at least 2 of the following four characteristics: 
unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by or causing 
avoidance of routine physical activity (eg, walking or climbing stairs). In addition, during the headache 
the patient must have had at least 1 between nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. 
These features must not have been attributable to another disorder. 
With regard to prognosis, migraine is a rather benign condition and is not associated with an increased 
risk of death. The natural history of migraine may slightly change according to the exact type of headache 
and usually ranges from complete resolution, to symptoms continuation with gradually less or even 
worsening intensity and frequency over time. Generally Episodic Migraine tend to convert to chronic 
migraine provided that medication overuse has taken place in the meantime. 
The presence of aura may double the risk for ischemic stroke (Kurth et al., 2012). Increase risk for 
migraine has been linked to young adult age, female gender, use of hormonal birth control, and smoking, 
whereas the absence of aura do not appear to be constitute a risk factor for specific conditions. Generally, 
the severity and frequency of migraine attacks tend to diminish with increasing age. 
2.1.5.  Management 
In the management of migraine, among the first steps to be taken there is the reduction or, if possible, 
the elimination of the exposure to triggers. This can be done through several ways that include diet and 
physical exercise. If control of these stimuli is ineffective in preventing the onset of the migraine crisis, 
and if intense pain prevents normal daily activities, it is possible to resort to drug therapy. 
Migraine medications can relieve pain and symptoms during the acute phase of headache or prevent 
further attacks. The most appropriate therapeutic approach should be formulated in relation to the extent 
of the disorder, the symptoms and the personal needs of the patient. In case of comorbid conditions, care 
should be taken when prescribing specific medications and considering drug interactions as well as the 
patient's individual metabolic characteristics. The excessive and prolonged use of these drugs can, in fact, 
cause resistance to treatment and generate a particular form of secondary headache due to drug overuse.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
Scientific Advice was received from the CHMP for galcanezumab on 18 December 2014 related to the 
pre-clinical and clinical development plan  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Galcanezumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells.  
Emgality is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection containing 120 mg of galcanezumab as 
active substance (also referred to as AS) formulated with L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride 
monohydrate, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride and water for injections (WFI). 
The finished product (also referred to as FP) is available in pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe (packs of 
1 and 3 each). 
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design (QbD) application, certain elements of an 
enhanced approach were applied. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Galcanezumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody of IgG4 that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) thus preventing its biological activity. Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been 
associated with migraine.  
Galcanezumab is comprised of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Each heavy chain 
contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn296. The N-linked glycosylation structure is 
predominantly a fucosylated, complex biantennary glycan with O-galactose residues (G0F) on either arm. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Information about the manufacturing, storage and control facilities for the active substance (AS) has 
been provided. GMP compliance for the manufacturers has been demonstrated. 
Manufacturing of the active substance is performed at Imclone Systems LLC (Branchburg), USA (part of 
Eli Lilly and Company). Galcanezumab is manufactured using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells fed 
batch process in bioreactors. The purification process includes a series of chromatography, viral 
inactivation and filtration steps. The process has been described in sufficient detail.  
Galcanezumab AS is filled into a gamma-irradiated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) container closed 
with a polypropylene screw-cap closure. Extractable and leachables studies have been presented 
adequately. Furthermore an acceptable specification for the HDPE container has been provided. The 
container closure for active substance is considered acceptable.

Control of materials 
Raw materials are sufficiently described and controlled. The history and generation of the cell substrate 
are described in detail. The Master Cell Bank (MCB)/WCB manufacturing, characterisation and viral 
testing have been executed in accordance to ICH Q5A and Q5D. An adequate protocol for preparation of 
future WCBs has been provided.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPP), in-process controls (IPC) and operational performance parameters 
(OPP) are described. It is noted that few operational parameters are classified as critical; however the 
process is well controlled. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to 
monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process.   
Process validation 
The process validation was performed and acceptable results from both critical and non-critical 
parameters and controls are presented. Furthermore, results from all production bioreactor CPPs are 
provided. The release results from the active substance validation batches are provided, together with 
information about additional data on in-process impurities. All acceptance criteria were met. Process 
validation demonstrated that the process is robust. Clearance of process-related impurities (host cell 
proteins (HCP), DNA, Protein A and Triton-X) was demonstrated to acceptable low levels (below limit of 
quantitation in several cases) during process validation.   
Manufacturing process development 
Three AS processes are described in the dossier. Two comprehensive comparative exercises were 
performed to demonstrate comparability between processes.  
The comparability assessments include comparison of specifications, comparison to historical data and 
head-to-head comparison among AS batches. The quality attributes evaluated were based on a risk 
assessment of the potential impact of the manufacturing process change. Overall, data from seven active 
substance batches were evaluated within the comparability assessment. This provides an assurance of 
similarity between the different processes. The strategy for determination of critical quality attributes 
(CQA) is well elaborated. With respect to process characterisation, each unit operation is described 
separately. The purpose of the step, process parameter risk assessment, description of small scale model, 
study plan and results from design of experiments (DoE) studies are adequately described with sufficient 
amount of details. The results support the ranges chosen for process parameters.  
Characterisation 
Physicochemical and biological characterisation of galcanezumab has been performed using a battery of 
state-of-the–art methods 
The product-related and process-related impurities in galcanezumab were characterised throughout 
development.  
Specification 
The specification of the AS includes control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general 
tests. 
The proposed release specification for AS is found acceptable with respect to test methods chosen. The 
release specification ranges are considered acceptable.

Consistent removal of process-related impurities has been demonstrated during process validation. 
Analytical methods 
The descriptions of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of AS contain a 
sufficient level of detail and are found acceptable. All non-compendial methods have been validated in 
accordance with ICH Q2 and are considered acceptable. These validations also include finished product. 
Compendial methods have been appropriately verified for their intended use. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis from process validation and commercial-scale, primary stability studies and clinical trial, 
development and toxicology studies are provided. The release results from the commercial AS process 
support a consistent manufacturing of active substance.  
Reference materials 
A two-tiered system is applied for the reference standard (RS). The current primary (PRS) and working 
reference standards (WRS) were manufactured from galcanezumab active substance batch selected as a 
representative Phase 3 clinical batch. The historical RS, qualification protocol for current PRS/WRS as well 
as qualification and requalification protocols for future WRS have been described.  
Stability 
A shelf life of 36 months at not more than -65°C for the storage of the active substance is considered 
acceptable. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is filled in a semi-finished syringe (SFS), which is further assembled into one of two 
different delivery devices. The proposed presentations are a pre-filled syringe and a pre-filled pen. Each 
pre-filled pen and each pre-filled syringe contains 120 mg of galcanezumab in 1 mL. 
All excipients are of compendial quality and comply with the corresponding Ph. Eur. monographs. The 
primary container closure system for galcanezumab solution for injection is a 1-mL-long, Type I 
borosilicate glass syringe barrel with laminated bromobutyl elastomeric plunger. The container closure 
system filled with finished product is referred to as the SFS. Compliance with relevant Ph. Eur. 
requirements in monographs has been confirmed for the materials of construction. 
The information provided for the delivery devices is comprehensive, and in general confirms the 
suitability of the chosen devices. The combination of the SFS and the pre-filled syringe, and the SFS and 
the pre-filled pen (auto-injector) forms two separate integral products, and are not considered as 
separate medical devices.  
Pharmaceutical development 
An acceptable overview of the development of the formulation has been provided, including data 
supporting the proposed composition of the commercial finished product. The commercial finished 
product manufacturing process was developed using a science- and risk-based approach, in line with ICH 
Q8. DoE/QbD principles have been implemented during development of the manufacturing process as 
well as the formulation for finished product. Extensive documentation has been presented and the results 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

are clearly summarised. The manufacturing process development is described in sufficient detail. The 
development of the control strategy is generally well explained and acceptable justification has been 
provided. The development of the primary container closure system is sufficiently described in the 
dossier. The safety of the materials of construction was established in accordance with the relevant 
standards. Comprehensive profiles for extractables for the container closure system have been provided. 
Container closure integrity has been evaluated. Compatibility has been confirmed and is considered 
appropriate 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The process involves five unit operations: buffer excipient solution compounding, finished product 
formulation compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic syringe filling and plunger insertion, and inspection. 
Limits for process parameters and process controls have been provided. The assembly process for the 
pre-filled syringe and the pre-filled pen is described. The information provided regarding the 
manufacturing process is considered sufficiently detailed.  
Process controls 
Operating ranges for process parameters and acceptance criteria for controls are provided for the 
parameters/controls that have been determined to be critical to ensuring that the CQAs are met (CPPs, 
critical IPCs, and in-process specifications). Parameters and controls (critical and non-critical) are 
managed via the internal quality system, including change control management, deviation management, 
and routine process and product performance monitoring. 
Process validation 
The process validation studies described in the dossier comprise FP process validation, sterilisation 
process validation, and shipping validation.  
Three consecutive commercial-scale process verification batches (also referred to as process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batches) were manufactured. All validation batches complied with the 
established in-process and release specifications, and all parameters were within operating ranges and 
met protocol acceptance criteria.  
Product specification 
The specifications for the galcanezumab finished product are presented and include control of identity, 
purity and impurities, potency and other general tests.  
The proposed FP release and end of shelf-life specifications are found acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
Several of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of FP are also used for release 
and stability testing of the AS. The analytical procedures applicable only for testing of FP have been 
described in sufficient detail. The non-compendial procedures specific to the control of FP have been 
appropriately validated. Compendial methods have been appropriately verified for their intended use.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard for testing of finished product is the same as described for active substance. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 13/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data has been provided for the PPQ batches and the primary stability batches, 
manufactured using the proposed commercial process and at commercial scale. All data complies with the 
proposed finished product specifications. In addition, batch analyses data is also included for early 
development batches. In conclusion, the batch analyses data demonstrates acceptable batch-to-batch 
consistency and reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for galcanezumab finished 
product. 
Stability of the product 
The provided real time and supportive stability data confirmed the acceptable shelf-life for FP of 24 
months at 2-8°C, in the original package in order to protect from light.   
Results from patient in-use stability study at end of shelf life support the proposed patient in-use period 
of 7 days up to 30°C.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Adventitious agents 
Raw material of animal origin used early in the cell line generation process has been listed and adequately 
addressed. The information provided in relation to adventitious agents for these materials together with 
the viral testing on MCB and end-of-production (EOP) cells (limit of in vitro cell age) is found adequate to 
address the adventitious agent safety of these materials.  
The risk of TSE contamination is considered adequately addressed.  
With regards to virus safety, satisfactory information has been provided regarding test of MCB, WCB and 
end-of-production cell bank (ECB).  
The viral clearance studies were performed in accordance with the CHMP Note for Guidance on Virus 
Validation Studies (CPMP/BWP/268/95) and ICH Q5A and demonstrate effective reduction of both 
enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The down-scale of the process steps has also been sufficiently 
described to justify the applicability of the virus clearance results to the full-scale process.  
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
Four post-approval change management protocols (PACMPs) were proposed. They are considered 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Emgality dossier was of good quality and no major issues were identified in the documentation 
submitted. There were however some “other concerns” identified, partly due to lack of detail, and also 
related to lack of justification for some proposals and statements made by the applicant. All these issues 
are now resolved. 
The AS and FP manufacturing process description and process controls were described with sufficient 
amount of detail and were considered acceptable. The cell bank system was properly tested and qualified. 
CPPs were identified and the process is appropriately validated. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

Extended characterisation of galcanezumab was performed. Multiple orthogonal analytical methods were 
applied to assess galcanezumab molecular properties, such as primary structure, post-translational and 
other modifications, higher order structure and biological activity. 
The information provided for the delivery devices, the pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, is 
comprehensive, and confirms the suitability of the chosen devices. Design verification was performed as 
per ISO 11608-1. Compliance with Medical Device Directive Essential Requirements has been 
demonstrated. 
The concern raised during the procedure related to the justification of specification for FP was 
satisfactorily addressed. Furthermore, additional data from the ongoing stability studies were requested 
to further support the proposed shelf-life for AS which is now considered acceptable.  
The applicant’s proposal for Established Conditions was removed from the dossier due to the draft status 
of ICH Q12 guideline on lifecycle management. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Emgality is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Emgality is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has conducted a comprehensive battery of tests to characterise pharmacology and 
toxicology of galcanezumab.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 15/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies have shown that galcanezumab was able to bind with relatively high (picomolar) affinity 
human CGRP with association rate (kon) of 7.4 x 106 M-1 s-1, dissociation rate (koff) of 2.2 x 10-4 s-1 
and average KD of 31 pM.  
LY2951742 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of cAMP production induced by both human and rabbit 
CGRPs on the human CGRP-receptor expressed in neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC, with IC50 values 
of 0.23 nM (human) and 0.06 nM (rabbit): this result supports the choice of rabbit as second species in 
the embryo-fetal development study. 
In vivo activity was demonstrated in male rat and in female cynomolgus models of capsaicin-induced 
increase of dermal blood flow (DBF). Galcanezumab (4 mg/Kg SC and 5 mg/Kg IV in rat and cynomolgus, 
respectively) potently reduced 2 mg capsaicin-induced increases in dermal blood flow by 80.5% at 5 days 
post-administration of galcanezumab in rats, and by 87%, 71%, 63% at 1, 15 and 29 days respectively, 
post-administration  of  galcanezumab  in  monkeys.  The  higher  dose  needed  in  rat  vs  cynomolgus  to 
achieve a similar effect in reducing the dermal blood flow, indicates that the rat is less relevant species.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  applicant  has  provided  an  overview  on  possible  secondary  pharmacology  effects  following 
galcanezumab treatment with focus on potential effects on glucose metabolism, gastrointestinal system, 
reducing defence from pathogens, delaying wound healing and effects on bone.  
Glucose metabolism  
CGRP  was  shown  to  inhibit  glucose-stimulated  insulin  secretion  in  normal  and  alphaCGRP  knockout 
animals. Possible implication of CGRP inhibitors in the treatment of metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes and 
obesity) is to be further studied. Interestingly, biological association between migraine and obesity has 
been postulated based on epidemiological evidence (i.e. common biomarkers that are elevated in both 
conditions, elevated plasma levels of CGRP found in obese individuals) (Recober and Goadsby, 2010). 
Gastrointestinal system  
It is well known that CGRP is widely distributed in the mesenteric neurons along gastrointestinal tract. 
Biological effects of CGRP on gastrointestinal tract include increase in the intestinal blood flow, relaxation 
of the smooth muscle, anti-inflammatory and immunesuppressive effects. In CGRP knockout mice, the 
ulcer  healing  process  elicited  by  acetic  acid  was  significantly  delayed  and  CGRP  was  able  to  prevent 
gastric  mucosal  injury  elicited  by  ethanol.  In  the  same  study,  a  proangiogenic  activity  of  CGRP  was 
demonstrated in vitro (Ohno et al., 2008).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 16/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adaptive and innate immunity  
Recent  studies  on  CGRP’s  role  in  innate  immune  responses  have  shown  that  CGRP  may  inhibit  the 
proinflammatory  response  and  neutrophil  function,  while  blocking  CGRP  signaling  in  prophylaxis  or 
treatment modes resulted in improved survival in a mouse model of bacterial pneumonitis. Therefore, 
blocking  of  CGRP  signalling  may  hypothetically  improve  clinical  outcomes  to  bacterial  infections. 
However, there are currently no signals from any of the non-clinical or clinical studies with galcanezumab 
in relation to immune function and susceptibility to infection or on mast cell mediated host defence.  
Wound healing 
The role of CGRP in facilitating wound healing is thought to be mediated through its ability to promote 
keratinocytes proliferation, enhance revascularization (angiogenetic effect), reduce expression of tumor 
necrosis factor-α and attenuate macrophage infiltration (Deen et al., 2017). Therefore, blocking of CGRP 
signalling may lead to alterations in wound healing and increased inflammatory responses in skin injuries 
at the site of injection. Non-clinical studies in rodents suggest that CGRP may play an important role in 
wound healing. The non-clinical toxicity studies conducted with galcanezumab in rats or monkeys show 
no significant effect of CGRP blockade on wound healing, which may, according to the Applicant, be partly 
explained by the redundancy in promoting angiogenesis at the site of injury. In addition, there is no direct 
evidence for alterations in wound healing observed in the clinical program of galcanezumab, nor have 
there been any reports on adverse effects on wound healing in the literature with other CGRP blocking 
antibodies used in migraine patients. 
Bone  
In  the  literature  CGRP  has  been  recognized  as  a  neurotransmitter  involved  in  the  regulation  of  bone 
formation  and  bone  remodeling.  Experimental  bone  studies  in  vitro  using  a  transfected  osteoblastic 
MG-63 human cell line have an osteogenic (bone producing) phenotype when exposed to CGRP, which 
favor osteoblast formation and the subsequent activation of bone formation. In vivo, transgenic mice 
overexpressing  CGRP  in  differentiated  osteoblasts  display  a  bone  phenotype  characterized  by  an 
increased bone volume caused by an increased rate of bone formation, while knockout mice deficient for 
alpha-CGRP are osteopenic due to a decrease in bone formation. Large animal studies evaluating the 
effects of CGRP on bone growth or maintenance of bone mass were not found in the literature. Based on 
human genetics it’s known that individuals with familial dysautonomia, who suffer from a progressive 
dysfunction of the autonomic, sensory, and motor nervous systems, show low levels of circulating CGRP 
and reduced bone mineral density. Collectively, these findings suggest that CGRP is an anabolic factor for 
bone acting directly on osteoblasts. The potential risk of adverse galcanezumab effects on bone growth 
and/or remodelling cannot be ruled out. 
Galcanezumab did not produce any effects on respiration rate and no galcanezumab-related neurological 
observations or changes in body temperature were noted in monkey. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were performed with galcanezumab. The safety pharmacology 
core battery to identify undesirable pharmacodynamic properties of galcanezumab to vital functions such 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

as cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system was included in the repeated-toxicity studies in 
monkey.  This  approach  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  EMA  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/767666/2014)  and 
provided a full description of the endpoints investigated according to ICH S7A guideline.  The applicant 
provided  additional  safety  data  on  potential  effects  of  CGRP  antagonism  on  coronary  vasospasm  and 
myocardial ischemia based on published experimental data which, however, does not include any clinical 
information on the potentially galcanezumab cardiovascular risks on treated patients as requested by ICH 
S7 guideline. 
Safety  pharmacology  endpoints  on  the  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  or  central  nervous  systems 
galcanezumab effect have been evaluated in the 6-week and 6-month repeated-dose toxicity studied in 
monkey (see toxicological section). In both studies, the cardiac effects of galcanezumab were evaluated 
through Electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation and measurements using jacketed non-surgical telemetry 
on anesthetized animals. ECG waveforms collected has been analyzed to determine PR and QT intervals, 
and QRS duration. The corrected QT (QTc) interval was determined using an individual animal correction 
factor.  The  RR  interval  has  been  used  to  derive  heart  rate  and  used  in  QT  interval  correction.  No 
galcanezumab-related effects  on  cardiovascular  parameters  measured  were identified in  the  6-month 
monkey study: i.e. no rhythm abnormalities or qualitative ECG changes and no effect on heart rate, RR or 
QTc interval were observed following galcanezumab SC administration at any dose group. The applicant 
clarifies that the cardiovascular (mainly QT/QTc interval) and neurovascular risk assessments, integrated 
in repeated-dose 6-week and 6-month toxicity studies, were performed at relevant exposure timepoints 
for toxicological extrapolation to clinical setting since monkeys exposure levels were sufficiently high up 
to 24 hours postdose on Day 29 [the last EEG recording time], and 16 hours postdose on Day 169 [the last 
EEG recording time], in the 6-week and 6-month studies, respectively. It is also noted that galcanezumab 
has  a  long  half-life  (in  monkey  single  dosed  IV=  7.6  days).  The  reduced  galcanezumab  serum 
concentrations due to suspected ADAs observed in 1 female exposed to the highest dose level (100 
mg/Kg) in the 6-week study, and in a number of female monkeys in the 6-month study in the lowest 
dose  level  (2  mg/kg),  were  recorded  after  Days  36  and  176,  respectively,  outside  the 
cardiovascular/neurovascular timepoints assessment.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due to the high target specificity of galcanezumab, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were 
performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No standard ADME studies were performed with galcanezumab according to ICH S6(R1) guideline. The 
only PK study on galcanezumab was a non-GLP study performed in male cynomolgus monkey using only 
one single dose (2 mg/kg) administered IV (8214340LO); thus, it is not possible to draw any conclusion 
on gender effect or any dose-response relationship. The applicant did not provide any justification about 
the rationale behind the large dose intervals used for the monkey dose-repeated toxicity studies (i.e. 
1.5-15-100 mg/kg; 15-100 mg/kg; 2-100 mg/kg). Following IV administration, the volume of distribution 
of galcanezumab was similar to total plasma volume in monkeys, as is typical for IgG4 monoclonal 
antibodies, which indicate galcanezumab is mainly confined in plasma compartment with limited 
extravasation within tissues.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 18/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an in vivo study (study PM120) aimed at exploring galcanezumab distribution in rat Central and 
Peripheral nervous tissues, SC radiolabelled galcanezumab distribution in peripheral and CNS tissues was 
limited with respect to plasma concentrations (in peripheral tissues -dura mater, spleen, and trigeminal 
ganglia- ranging from 5% to 11%; in hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord 
ranging from 0.10% to 0.35%; in the CSF ranging from 0.10% to 0.13%).  The Cmax of galcanezumab 
was seen at 72 hrs and persisted for at least 7 days. Tissue binding was persistent across 7 days post 
dose. Results indicate that antibody distribution into the central nervous system including the 
cerebrospinal fluid is relatively low compared to peripheral tissues. The distribution of galcanezumab into 
the dura mater and the trigeminal ganglia is more similar to that of a highly innervated peripheral tissue, 
such as spleen, than central nervous system tissues, confirming that these two tissues are outside of the 
blood brain barrier and are potential target tissues for galcanezumab.  
No studies on protein binding have been conducted since specific or non-specific interactions with plasma 
proteins were not expected to occur for galcanezumab. 
Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as an endogenous IgG. As such, there is no metabolic 
inhibition or induction of enzymatic pathways. 
The physical size of galcanezumab (144.084 kDa) excludes it from efficient glomerular filtration and, 
therefore, elimination of intact galcanezumab via urine is not expected.  Biliary secretion is not an 
important route of elimination of IgG antibodies. Therefore, rather than being excreted, galcanezumab 
will be eliminated by degradation to smaller peptides and amino acids by a variety of proteolytic processes 
in the cells following receptor-mediated endocytosis that is saturable because of the finite number of 
targets. 
Galcanezumab is not anticipated to be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, and is unlikely to have any effect 
on transporters or drug-metabolising enzymes because it has high specificity for the target ligand CGRP. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that rely on renal or hepatic mechanisms for their 
clearance are not expected, and no drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. PD interaction studies 
with drugs that are potentially going to be co- administered in the clinical situation would be more 
relevant. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in monkeys and rats were 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months in 
duration.  Fertility,  embryo-fetal  development,  and  pre-  and  postnatal  development  studies  were 
conducted  in  rats.  Embryo-fetal  development  studies  were  also  conducted  in  rabbits.  Additionally,  a 
juvenile toxicity study in rats was conducted to assess potential effects on growth and development to 
support  paediatric  development.  In  all  toxicity  studies,  galcanezumab  was  administered  by  SC  route, 
which is the clinical route. 
Overall,  galcanezumab  was  well  tolerated  in  rat.    Deaths  observed  during  and  after  dosing  phase  in 
female  and  male  animals,  were  registered  only  in  the  6-month  repeated-dose  rat  toxicity  study 
(8297946) at the highest dose level of 250 mg. The Applicant considered these deaths not related to 
galcanezumab due to the lack of any notable pathology findings in these animals.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 19/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Across  all  toxicology  studies,  the  most  frequent  observed  finding  was  minimal  to  slight  perivascular 
mononuclear cell infiltrates, chronic inflammation, and pigment at injection sites (SC) that was generally 
dose-dependent with no evident gender effect and reversed at the end of the recovery period in 15 and 
100 mg/kg dose levels. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies in rats were conducted to assess the potential effects of galcanezumab on male and female 
fertility, embryo-fetal development (also in rabbits), and prenatal and postnatal development.  
No effects on fertility parameters such as oestrous cycle, sperm analysis, or mating and reproductive 
performance were observed in rats that were administered galcanezumab (exposures approximately 4 to 
20 times the human exposure at 240 mg). In male fertility study, right testis weight was significantly 
reduced at exposures to 4 times the human exposure at 240 mg. 
At Gestational Day 20, an increase in the number of foetuses and litters with short ribs and a decrease in 
the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae occurred in the rat embryo-foetal toxicity development 
study at an exposure approximately 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg. These findings were noted 
at no maternal toxicity and were considered to be related to galcanezumab but non-adverse.  
At Gestational Day 29, in rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study skull anomaly was found in one 
male foetus from mother treated with galcanezumab at an exposure approximately 33 times the human 
exposure at 240 mg. 
In a juvenile toxicology study in which rats were administered galcanezumab twice weekly from Postnatal 
Day 21 through 90, systemic effects were limited to reversible, minimal, nonadverse decreases in total 
bone mineral content and bone mineral density at exposures approximately 50 times the human 
exposure at 240  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance galcanezumab is a protein, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, galcanezumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
CGRP is widely expressed in both central and peripheral nervous systems and maternal and foetal tissues 
with a wide-range control functions. Consequently, the Applicant has provided an overview on possible 
secondary pharmacology effects following galcanezumab treatment with focus on potential effects of 
galcanezumab on glucose metabolism, gastrointestinal system, reducing defence from pathogens, 
delaying wound healing and effects on bone.  
Inhibition of CGRP pathway could result in diarrhea or constipation and could evoke gastric ulcerative 
events. Events of gastric and peptic ulcers were found in clinical trials even if no clear causal relationship 
with galcanezumab treatment has been determined. In the monkey 6-month study, dose-dependent fecal 
abnormalities (liquid and/or non-formed) related to galcanezumab, were observed but not considered 
adverse because did not result in changes in body weight or clinical condition. In clinical studies cases of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 20/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constipation (even persistent) have been observed more frequently in galcanezumab treated patients 
compared to placebo. 
The role of CGRP in facilitating wound healing is thought to be mediated through its ability to promote 
keratinocytes proliferation, enhance revascularization (angiogenetic effect), reduce expression of tumor 
necrosis factor-α and attenuate macrophage infiltration (Deen et al., 2017). Therefore, blocking of CGRP 
signalling may lead to alterations in wound healing and increased inflammatory responses in skin injuries 
at the site of injection. The non-clinical toxicity studies conducted with galcanezumab in rats or monkeys 
show no significant effect of CGRP blockade on wound healing, which may, according to the applicant, be 
partly explained by the redundancy in promoting angiogenesis at the site of injury. In addition, there is no 
direct evidence for alterations in wound healing observed in the clinical program of galcanezumab, nor 
have there been any reports on adverse effects on wound healing in the literature with other CGRP 
blocking antibodies used in migraine patients. 
The  applicant  did  not  provide  any  discussion  on  the  implication  of  CGRP  in  the  respiratory  system. 
However, in the 6-week and 6-month repeated-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys there were 
no effects of galcanezumab on respiration function with exposure margins exceeding 100-fold compared 
to clinical Cmax.  
No  non-clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  fully  investigate  the  vascular  effects  of  galcanezumab  to 
evaluate its vasoconstriction potential such as test in isolated arteries (e.g. aorta, coronary artery); any 
additional  mechanistic/safety  non-clinical  studies  to  address  the  role  of  this  specific  target  in  human 
ischemic diseases would be poorly informative given the lack of validated and predictive animal (rodent) 
models. 
Although no direct measurement of hemodynamic parameters was carried out in animal studies, “Serious 
cardiovascular outcomes in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events” is now 
included among the important potential risk. In addition, cardiovascular safety will be considered in the 
"Observational Cohort Study of Galcanezumab Utilisation and Long-Term Safety" as required additional 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
According to Walter et al. (2014) it has been suggested that CGRP in the CNS is associated with regulation 
of various hemodynamic parameters, while peripheral inhibition of CGRP does not induce any 
hemodynamic changes, likely due to the number of overlapping compensatory mechanisms that are 
involved in the modulation of blood pressure.  
No non-clinical studies were conducted to fully investigate the vascular effects of galcanezumab to 
evaluate its vasoconstriction potential such as test in isolated arteries (e.g. aorta, coronary artery). 
In vitro galcanezumab was able to prevent activation of the AMY-R also found in human coronary arteries: 
thus, respect to CGRP-R antagonist, galcanezumab shows a potential additional risk for cardiovascular 
and neurovascular risk. CGRP administration in vivo rat models of cerebral ischemia significantly reduced 
ischemic brain injury volume by improving blood flow in the penumbra region via its action of vasodilation 
and playing in this way an indirect cerebral neuroprotection (Jeremy P et al 1994 - Zhen Liu et al 2011 vol. 
171). 
Consistently with ICH S6(R1) guidance, genotoxicity studies were not conducted because galcanezumab 
is a monoclonal antibody. Standard carcinogenicity bioassays of galcanezumab were not conducted, as 
well. On the basis of evidence gathered so far, further in vivo or in vitro (e.g. cellular proliferation) studies 
aimed at better characterizing the galcanezumab carcinogenic potential, are not envisaged.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

In the literature CGRP has been recognized as a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of bone 
formation and bone remodeling. Large animal studies evaluating the effects of CGRP on bone growth or 
maintenance of bone mass were not found in the literature. Based on human genetics it’s known that 
individuals with familial dysautonomia, who suffer from a progressive dysfunction of the autonomic, 
sensory, and motor nervous systems, show low levels of circulating CGRP and reduced bone mineral 
density. Collectively, these findings suggest that CGRP is an anabolic factor for bone acting directly on 
osteoblasts. The potential risk of adverse galcanezumab effects on bone growth and/or remodelling 
cannot be ruled out. 
Bone effect of galcanezumab was specifically investigated only in juvenile rat study in which treatment 
with galcanezumab 250 mg/kg reduced bone content and density in both female and male metaphysis, 
but however adverse effects in bone development (i.e. short ribs -right, left, or bilateral 13th-, reduction 
in the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae) were also observed in foetuses and litters from female 
rats dosed 250 mg/kg (study 20096436).  
Considering the CGRP role in supporting bone metabolism, adverse effect in children growth is of 
particular concern, considering the chronic intended treatment. Although the applicant clarified that no 
alteration of bone parameters, assessed as gross examination, was observed in adults monkey in 
repeated-dose toxicity studies up to 100 mg/kg treatment, signs of potential impact on bone metabolism 
have been shown in toxicity studies in juvenile rats and in embryo-foetal development toxicity studies in 
rat and rabbits, up to galcanezumab 250 mg/kg.  
In the additional rat embryo-foetal development toxicity study, increases in the foetal and litter 
incidences of short ribs, as well as a reduction in the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae (which 
reached statistically significance vs control group), occurred at the only dose tested of 250 mg/kg 
(corresponding to 20-fold the clinical exposure reached with 240 mg) and were considered to be related 
to galcanezumab but non-adverse. These findings were noted at no maternal toxicity. Although signs in 
bone metabolism were observed in both embryo-foetal development toxicity studies at high multiple of 
clinical exposure, results have been reflected in the section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Moreover, the potential negative impact of galcanezumab on maintenance of bone mass might be 
particular relevant in the elderly and in post-menopausal women with underlying osteoporosis. No 
imbalance was observed in the frequency of bone fractures between galcanezumab treated patients and 
PBO Phase 3 trials. However, based on the physiological role of CGRP and on data coming from animal 
studies, it could not be ruled out that long term use of CGRP inhibitors may adversely impact migraine 
patients with more fragile bone metabolism (e.g., post-menopausal women, osteoporotic patients) and 
young growing patients. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted in support of galcanezumab are considered adequate for the marketing 
authorisation in the prophylaxis of migraine in adults.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Page 23/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Based on the population PK analysis, mean peak serum concentrations of galcanezumab are expected to 
be achieved by 5 to 7 days after receiving a subcutaneous dose of 120- or 240-mg galcanezumab. Slow 
absorption observed following subcutaneous administration is consistent with the PK properties of  an 
immunoglobulin (Ig)G monoclonal antibody.  The time to peak serum concentration is similar in healthy 
subjects and patients, and after a single administration or multiple administration.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of galcanezumab was 7.3 L (34% Inter Individual Variability 
[IIV]). 
Elimination 
Galcanezumab  is  not  expected  to  be  metabolised  by  the  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  families  of 
drug-metabolising enzymes responsible for metabolism and elimination of small molecules and would, 
therefore, not produce any active metabolites. 
The physical size of galcanezumab (144.084  kDa)  excludes it from  efficient glomerular filtration  and, 
therefore, elimination of intact galcanezumab via urine is not expected.  
Biliary secretion is not a predominant route of elimination of IgG antibodies. Therefore, galcanezumab is 
not expected to be excreted in bile. IgG is catabolised to small peptides and amino acids by proteolytic 
processes in cells following endocytosis. Galcanezumab is expected to be catabolised in the same manner 
as IgG. 
The apparent clearance is low (0.00785 L/h) and this is consistent with the long half-life (about 27 days). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Galcanezumab  is  a  humanized  IgG4  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide 
(CGRP)  and  prevents  its  biological  activity  without  blocking  the  CGRP  receptor.  Elevated  blood 
concentrations  of  CGRP  have  been  associated  with  migraine.  In  addition,  CGRP  infusions  can  induce 
migraine-like attacks in some individuals with a history of migraine. Galcanezumab targets CGRP and 
binds  with  high  affinity  (KD  =  31  pM)  and  high  specificity  (>10,000-fold  vs  related  peptides 
adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin and intermedin). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic  evaluations  were  conducted  mainly  on  the  basis  of  total  concentrations  of  CGRP 
(ligand  that  binds  to  the  galcanezumab  antibody),  immunogenicity,  and  migraine  headache  days 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 24/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(primary efficacy outcome). In patients with migraine, the total CGRP plasma concentrations increased 
following galcanezumab treatment, and then declined after galcanezumab treatment was stopped. These 
data indicate that the disposition of CGRP is governed by the disposition characteristics of galcanezumab 
because  most  CGRP  is  bound  to  galcanezumab  at  the  galcanezumab  concentrations  achieved  after 
120-mg and 240-mg doses. At 240 mg, mean CGRP plasma concentrations were slightly higher than at 
120 mg.    
A  dose  of  120  and  240  mg  is  estimated  to  achieve  an  average  concentration  of  galcanezumab  at 
steady-state  during  multiple  dosing  (Cav,ss)  of  22100  and  42300  ng/mL,  respectively.  At  these 
concentrations,  CGRP  is  estimated  to  be  greater  than  99.9%  bound  to  galcanezumab  and  indicates 
extensive target engagement. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Galcanezumab  is  a  humanized  IgG4  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide 
(CGRP) and prevents its biological activity without blocking the CGRP receptor. The clinical pharmacology 
of galcanezumab has been studied in healthy subjects, and in patients with episodic and chronic migraine. 
Moreover, the relative bioavailabilty of galcanezumab  lyophilised  formulation and  solution formulation 
has been investigated.  
Based on the population PK analysis, Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUCtau,ss increased dose proportionally 
after receiving a subcutaneous dose of 120- or 240-mg galcanezumab. Body weight was identified as a 
significant covariate on CL/F and its effect on galcanezumab concentration has been investigated. No PK 
interaction with other drugs is expected considering that galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody. 
According to ICH E14 guidance R3, a thorough QT/QTc study was not conducted. However, in order to 
better investigate QT interval prolongation, the Applicant was requested to provide an exposure-safety 
analysis.  The  exposure-safety  analysis  to  investigate  QT  interval  prolongation  has  been  provided.  
Galcanezumab concentration-ΔQTcF modelling seams to support the conclusion that galcanezumab does 
not prolong QTcF interval at the doses evaluated in the Phase 3 migraine program. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that galcanezumab PK and PD profiles have been characterised sufficiently.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of galcanezumab in migraine prophylaxis in adults was tested through three pivotal, phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical studies, of which two identically 
designed in episodic migraine (Studies I5Q-MC-CGAG [CGAG] and I5Q-MC-CGAH [CGAH]) and one in 
chronic migraine (Study I5Q-MC-CGAI [CGAI]). Supportive data come from 1 open-label Phase 3 study in 
patients with either episodic or chronic migraine up to 1 year (Study I5Q-MC-CGAJ [CGAJ]), and 2 Phase 
2 studies: a proof-of concept study (Study I5QAR-ART1 [ART-01] and a dose-ranging study (Study 
I5Q-MC-CGAB [CGAB]).

2.6.  Dose response study 
Study CGAB in episodic migraine (with or without aura) 
This was a phase 2b, randomized, dose-ranging, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
LY2951742 in patients with episodic migraine, conducted in 37 study centers in 1 country (United States) 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY2951742 in the prevention of migraine headache and to 
determine the optimal LY2951742 dose(s) for future Phase 3 development.  
This study included 5 treatment groups: galcanezumab at 5 mg, 50 mg, 120 mg, 300 mg or placebo. The 
study comprised 4 study periods: I) screening and washout period, II) a prospective 4-week baseline 
period for assessment of the type, frequency, and severity of headaches, III) a 12-week treatment 
period, and IV) a 12-week post-treatment, follow-up period.  
The primary efficacy objective was to assess whether at least one dose of galcanezumab was superior to 
placebo in the prevention of migraine headache. 
A total of 414 patients entered the study, and 410 received at least one dose of study drug (LY2951742, 
N=273; placebo, N=137). Overall, 375 patients (91.5%) completed the study’s double-blind treatment 
period (Study Period III), with 249 patients (91.2 %) in the LY_All doses group completing treatment and 
126 patients (92%) in the placebo group completing treatment. Overall, the patient population was 
predominantly female (83%) and White (75%), with a mean age of approximately 40 years. Significant 
differences at baseline were observed between the overall galcanezumab and placebo groups for weight 
(p=.033), BMI (p=.005), multiple race (p=.046), and the number of patients who declared Black or 
African American as their race (p=.003). The number of baseline MHDs (overall mean: 6.7 days), 
probable and migraine headache days (overall mean: 8.3 days), or migraine attacks (overall mean: 4.7 
attacks) were not different among treatment groups, nor were there any significant differences in the 
mean severity of migraine, mean severity of migraine for patients who had experienced at least 1 
headache, and the number of days with migraine headache medication use.  
At Week 12, the only dose regimen to satisfy the primary objective and meet the critical success factor in 
the last 28-day period (Month 3) was the 120 mg dose, which also showed a statistically significant overall 
effect (Month 1 to Month 3) (see Table below). 
The totality of presented data including analysis of relationship of galcanezumab serum concentration and 
mean change from baseline of number of MHDs, suggest that both highest – 120 mg and 300 mg, - tested 
doses are having similar efficacy supporting dose selection for phase 3 pivotal studies.

2.6.1.  Main studies 
Studies I5Q-MC-CGAG (CGAG, the EVOLVE-1 study) and I5Q-MC-CGAH 
(CGAH, the EVOLVE-2 study) for episodic migraine (with or without aura) 
Studies CGAG and CGAH were two identically designed Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies of galcanezumab administered as monthly subcutaneous injection in patients 
suffering from episodic migraine. Two doses of galcanezumab were evaluated, 120 mg/month and 240 
mg/month, to assess whether at least 1 dose would be superior to placebo in the prevention of migraine 
headache in during a 6-month double-blind treatment phase. Due to the identical design, both studies are 
described together in this report.  
Methods 
Each study comprised 4 study periods (SP):  
SP I: Screening.  Full clinical assessment, including a comprehensive medical evaluation documenting 
medical history, and a physical and neurological examination at Visit 1. Patients were required to 
discontinue all migraine prevention treatments at least 30 days prior to Visit 2. Botulinum toxin A or B in 
the head or neck area should have been discontinued at least 4 months prior to Visit 2.  
SP II: Baseline. A prospective 30-40 day baseline phase to determine the final eligibility to the study of 
qualified patients. Beginning at Visit 2, patients logged in daily to the electronic patient-reported 
outcomes (ePRO) system to answer questions about the occurrence of headaches, headache duration, 
headache features, severity of headache, and use of headache medication. This prospective baseline 
CHMP assessment report

Page 27/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period was to confirm that the patient had between 4 and 14 MHDs and at least 2 migraine attacks 
between Visits 2 and 3, and to establish baseline data for comparison of endpoints during the treatment 
phase. 
SP III: Treatment (6-month double-blind treatment phase). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 
treatment groups in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, 120 mg/month galcanezumab (with a loading dose 
of 240 mg at V3 only, i.e. 2 injections of 120 mg each), or 240 mg/month galcanezumab, respectively.  
Patients continued to log in and complete the ePRO diary each day. Patients could continue to 
take their allowed acute migraine headache medications during the treatment phase, but opioid- and 
barbiturate containing medications were limited to 3 days per month, with only 1 corticosteroid injection 
allowed at any time during the trial, and no oral corticosteroids. 
SP IV: Follow-up (4-month FU, ongoing). All randomized patients were to enter this 4-month 
post-treatment phase (washout), including patients who discontinued treatment early in SP III. Patients 
did not receive galcanezumab or placebo in SP IV. One month after Visit 12, if clinically warranted due to 
a worsening of symptoms, patients could start migraine prevention medications at the discretion of the 
investigator. Blind was maintained to site personnel and patients regarding previous treatment 
assignments. 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria  
1-  Patients are male and female 18 to ≤65 years of age at the time of screening. 
2-  Diagnosis of migraine as defined by HIS ICHD-3 beta guidelines (1.1 or 1.2) (ICHD-3 2013), with 
a history of migraine headaches of at least 1 year prior to Visit 1, and migraine onset prior to age 
50. 
3-  Prior to visit 1, a history of 4 to 14 MHDs occurring during at least 2 migraine attacks per month 
on average over the past 3 months. 
4-  From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (prospective baseline period), have a frequency of 4 to 14 MHDs occurring 
during at least 2 migraine attacks (patients must be unaware regarding the number of migraine 
headache days on which study qualification is based, to avoid biased reporting). 
5-  From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (prospective baseline period), must achieve sufficient compliance with 
ePRO daily headache entries as demonstrated by completion of at least 80% of daily diary entries. 
Treatments 
Patients received galcanezumab (120 or 240 mg) or placebo administered once monthly by subcutaneous 
injection at dosing visits. Patients randomized to the 120-mg dose received a loading dose of 240 mg (2 
injections of 120 mg each at Visit 3 only). All treatment groups received two 1-ml injections of IMP at each 
dosing visit to maintain the blind (two placebo injections, two 120-mg galcanezumab injections, or one 
placebo injection and one 120-mg injection) for a total of 6 administrations during the 6-month treatment 
phase. Subcutaneous injection sites included the abdomen, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that at least 1 dose of galcanezumab (120 or 240 
mg/month) is superior to placebo in the prevention of migraine headache in patients with episodic 
migraine.  
Key secondary objectives were as follows:  
-To compare LY2951742 with placebo with respect to 50%-75%-100% response rate (during the 
6-month double-blind treatment phase); 
-To compare LY2951742 with placebo with respect to change in functioning (as assessed through the 
mean change from baseline in the Role Function-Restrictive domain score of the MSQ Questionnaire ver. 
2.1 (average of Months 4, 5, and 6); 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs during 
the 6-month double-blind treatment phase. 
  Key secondary endpoints were: 50%, 75%, and 100% response rates in terms of monthly MHDs 
  Mean change from baseline in the MSQ v2.1 Role Function-Restrictive domain score (average of 
Months 4, 5, and 6) 
  Overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs with acute medication use for 
treatment of migraine or headache 
  Mean change from baseline in the PGI-S (average of Months 4, 5, and 6) 
Sample size 
Approximately 1557 patients had to be screened to ensure randomization of 825 patients at each phase 
3 study on EM (CGAG and CGAH), with an estimated 611 completers. Eligible patients had to be 
randomized in blinded fashion in a 2:1:1 ratio to placebo (target of 413 patients), LY2951742 120 
mg/month (target of 206 patients), or 240 mg/month (target of 206 patients), estimated to provide 
approximately 95% power with the assumption of a 26% discontinuation rate and an effect size of 0.33, 
and that at least 1 dose of LY2951742 would separate from placebo at a two-sided significance level of 
0.05 based on simulations using Dunnett (Dunnett 1955) test.  
Randomisation 
After enrolment, patients were randomized to double-blind treatment at Visit 3 with an assignment of 
each patient to a treatment group determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an 
interactive web-response system (IWRS), which also allowed the personnel to double-check the correct 
assignment package by entering the confirmation number found on the package into the IWRS (which in 
turn also allowed Emergency unblinding for AEs).  
A stratification by ‘region’ (the eastern half of the US, the western half of the US, Puerto Rico and Canada 
for study CGAG, whereas it was unspecified for study CGAH) and ‘baseline migraine frequency’ (<8 vs. ≥8 
MHDs/month in both studies) was carried out, in order to achieve between-group comparability. To 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 29/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ensure an appropriate balance of low- and high-frequency migraine headache day patients, the sponsor 
had planned to stop enrolment of low-frequency patients if the number exceeded an estimated 578. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct of the study were blinded to 
individual treatment assignments for the duration of the study. A minimum number of Lilly personnel was 
allowed to have access to the randomization table and treatment assignments before database lock for 
the double-blind treatment phase.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses was to be conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, including all randomized 
patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  investigational  product,  each  analyzed  according  to  the 
randomized treatment group. When change from baseline was assessed, the patient was included in the 
analysis only if he/she had a baseline and a postbaseline measurement.  
The  primary  efficacy  measure  is  the  overall  mean  change  from  the  baseline  period  in  the  number  of 
monthly  migraine  headache  day  during  the  6-month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  and  the  primary 
analysis will evaluate the efficacy of LY2951742 (120 or 240 mg/month) compared with placebo. The 
primary  analysis  was  to  be  performed  using  a  restricted  maximum  likelihood-based  mixed  models 
repeated measures (MMRM) technique with prespecified model terms and unstructured covariance matrix 
.  The  analysis  had  to  include  the  fixed  categorical  effects  of  treatment,  region,  month,  and 
treatment-by-month  interaction,  as  well  as  the  continuous  fixed  covariates  of  baseline  number  of 
migraine headache days and baseline number of migraine headache days-by-month interaction. 
In addition to the MMRM approach, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model or analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) had to be implemented. The ANCOVA model 
included the main effects of treatment and region, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline, 
while the ANOVA model used the same terms except the continuous fixed covariate of baseline.

A total of 1671 patients were screened and 862 patients were randomized. The most common reason for 
screen failure was patients not meeting criteria for study enrolment based on migraine headache 
information collected in the ePRO diary during the prospective baseline phase. A total of 858 randomized 
patients received at least 1 dose of IP and were included in the ITT population (n=433 patients 
randomized to placebo, n=213 patients randomized to galcanezumab 120 mg, and n=212 patients 
randomized to galcanezumab 240 mg).  
Overall, 703 patients (81.9%) completed the double-blind treatment phase (n=351 patients in the 
placebo arm, n=177 patients in the galcanezumab 120 mg arm, and n=175 patients in the galcanezumab 
240 mg).  
The overall discontinuation rate from the double-blind treatment phase due to any reason was 18.9% 
(n=82) in the placebo group, 16.9% and 17.4% in the galcanezumab 120mg and 240mg groups, 
respectively, totalling 155 patients (18.1%), with 113 of those patients also discontinuing from study and 
the remaining 42 patients discontinuing treatment while continuing in the post-treatment phase.  The 
most frequent reason for discontinuation from the double-blind treatment phase was withdrawal by 
patient in similar percentage across treatment groups. Seven patients discontinued from the treatment 
phase of the study due to pregnancy and for one of them (Patient assigned to the placebo group) it 
resulted as physician decision.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 90 study centers in 2 countries.  
Of the 858 subjects  in the ITT population (i.e., who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP), 
843 patients with nonmissing change in MHDs were analyzed for the primary efficacy measure. Efficacy 
analyses were performed on the ITT population. 
First patient enrolled on 11 January 2016, last patient completed the double-blind phase on 22 March

Concomitant Medications 
The vast majority of patients (92.8%) used a concomitant therapy during the double-blind treatment 
period, the most commonly used (≥5%) concomitant medications (i.e., taken during the study and 
recorded via eCRF) were generally not significantly differently distributed among groups (in order, 
ibuprofen, paracetamol, thomapyrin N, sumatriptan, vitamins, naproxen sodium, vitamin D NOS, 
cetirizine hydrochloride, salbutamol, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and loratadine and many others).  
The concomitant medications used for the acute treatment of migraine as recorded by patients in the 
ePRO diary were accounted for as an efficacy measure and patients were allowed to start migraine 
prevention medications not before one month after the last visit of the treatment phase (Visit 12) at the 
discretion of the investigator if clinically warranted due to a worsening of symptoms. However, 
statistically significant differences between treatment groups were seen in the use of some concomitant 
medications: thomapyrin N (24.06% in LY-240mg vs 15.02% in LY-120mg [p=.020]), cetirizine 
hydrochloride (5.3% in placebo vs 12.7% galcanezumab 120 mg [p=.002]) and naproxen sodium (9.5% 
placebo vs 4.25% LY-240mg [p=.02]). 
Concomitant therapies frequently used during the DB period were comparable with the ones used  during 
the post-treatment phase, with the addition of fish oil and vitamin B12.

Outcomes and estimation 
ePRO compliance  
Given the crucial role played by the ePRO diary compliance for the assessment of key primary and 
secondary efficacy measure, it was observed that the average compliance in the ITT population across 
month 1 to 6 was 89.8% in placebo, 91.9% and 90.8% in the LY-120mg and LY-240mg, respectively, 
without significant differences among treatment groups.

A statistically significant improvement for both doses of galcanezumab compared with placebo was 
observed as early as at Month 1 for both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups (to be 
noted that patients in the 120-mg treatment group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first 
injection, the initial treatment effect observed at Month 1 was based on a 240-mg dose). Such a 
difference was maintained for all subsequent months during the double-blind treatment phase.

conducted with a repeated measures negative binomial regression analysis fitted with SAS PROC 
GLIMMIX: 
Abbreviations: LY = LY2951742; N = number of intent-to-treat subjects who have non-missing baseline value and at 
least one post-baseline value. 
Negative Binomial Model: raw number of MHDs = offset, treatment, pooled region 1/country, month, and 
treatment*month, baseline, and baseline*month.

The outcomes of the primary analyses remained unmodified also after performing another form of 
sensitivity analysis on patients with outlier residuals identified as those who had absolute value of 
studentized residual less than 2 at any month of the double-blind treatment phase. The results remained 
consistent before and after removing outlier patients (N=46 for placebo, N=24 for galcanezumab 120 mg, 
and N=31 for galcanezumab 240 mg): 
Abbreviations: LY = LY2951742; N = number of intent-to-treat subjects who have non-missing baseline value and at 
least one post-baseline value; CI = confidence interval; LS = least square; SE = standard error. The values obtained 
are from separate repeated measures analyses of 2 patient populations: All patients, Placebo and LY120mg and 
LY240mg patients with a Studentized Residual >=2 or <= -2 at any month are dropped. 
Each MMRM Model: Change = treatment, pooled region 1/country, month, and treatment*month, baseline, and 
baseline*month. Estimates were obtained using unstructured covariance structure. The Kenward-Roger 
approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  Source: Table CGAG.14.18 of Report Body 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
After ensuring that the primary objective was met, the set of key secondary objectives were tested

Further Response Analyses Based on Reduction in Monthly MHDs  
Percentages of patients who had a ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reduction in MHD: 
Source: Fig. 2.7.3.5; 2.7.3.6; 2.7.3.7 of the Summary of clinical efficacy 
At each month, the percentages of patients with ≥50% or ≥75% reduction from baseline in MHDs were 
statistically significantly greater in both the galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups 
compared with placebo. Similar results were obtained for 100% reduction from baseline in MHDs, except 
for one time point that was not statistically significantly different between galcanezumab 240 mg and 
placebo (Month 3). 
The distribution of response rates (i.e., the mean percentage of patients with different levels of reduction 
from baseline in monthly MHDs during the 6-month double-blind treatment phase), took into account 21 
levels of monthly MHD reduction in 5% increments starting from ≥0%, up to 100% response. The 
following figure shows the response rates based on estimates from the GLIMMIX model, over the ITT 
population:

Onset of treatment effect and Maintenance of effect 
Based on results from the primary analysis model for change from baseline in number of monthly MHDs 
during  the  double-blind  treatment  phases  of  each  study,  the  earliest  month  in  which  a  statistically 
significant  improvement  for  both  doses  of  galcanezumab  compared  with  placebo  was  observed  and 
maintained for all subsequent months during the double-blind treatment phase was considered the month 
of  onset  of  effect.  For  study  CGAG,  onset  of  treatment  effect  was  observed  at  Month  1  for  both 
galcanezumab treatment groups. 
A statistically significantly higher percentage of patients in each galcanezumab treatment group 
maintained the ≥50% response for both at least 3 and 6 consecutive months during the DB treatment 
phase compared with placebo: 
Abbreviations: LY = LY2951742; N = number of intent-to-treat subjects who have non-missing baseline value and at least one 
post-baseline value. 
*a: p-values from logistic regression: x-month sustained 50% responder indicator = treatment, pooled region1/country, and baseline. 
X is either 3 or 6, defined below: 3-month sustained 50% responders are defined as patients meeting 50% response criteria for their  
last three months in the treatment phase; everyone else are non-responders, including those  discontinued early within 3 months and 
those continued after 3 months but did not meet 50% response  criteria for their last three months. 6-month sustained 50% responders 
are defined as patients meeting 50% response criteria for all 6  months during the treatment phase; everyone else are non-responders, 
including those who  discontinued early and those who completed 6-month treatment phase but did not meet 50% response  criteria for 
one or more of the 6 months.   
Secondary Analyses on Health Outcomes 
The Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ v2.1) was administered at baseline and monthly 
post-baseline visits, while the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) was administered at baseline, 
Month 3, and Month 6.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

Migraine symptoms  
Further exploratory analyses were conducted at each month and overall over the mean reductions from 
baseline in number of monthly MHDs with nausea and/or vomiting, as well as photophobia and 
phonophobia, which resulted statistically significantly greater in both galcanezumab dose treatment 
groups compared with placebo.  
Migraine with aura 
Exploratory analyses were also conducted on the overall mean reductions from baseline in number of 
monthly MHDs with aura as well as prodromal symptoms other than aura, the vast majority of which were 
statistically significantly greater at each month in both the galcanezumab dose groups compared with 
placebo. 
• 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy measure 
There were no differential treatment effects based on sex, race, ethnicity, or presence of aura or not at 
baseline. Statistically significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions at a 2-sided 0.1 significance level 
were present for baseline MHD category (<8 vs. ≥ 8) and baseline treatment resistance status (failed ≥
2 prior preventive treatments or not). For baseline MHD category, there was a greater treatment effect 
with galcanezumab 240 mg compared to placebo  in patients with  ≥ 8  MHDs  at baseline.  For  baseline 
treatment resistance status, there was a greater treatment effect with galcanezumab 240 mg compared

with  placebo  and  compared  with  galcanezumab  120  mg  in  the  patients  who  had  failed  at  least  2 
treatments.  
Exploratory responder analyses were conducted on the MSQ Role Function-Restrictive domain and MIDAS 
total score. 
 
 
For the MSQ Role Function-Restrictive domain, response was defined as change from baseline to 
average of Months 4 to 6 ≥ 25. The percentages of patients meeting this definition of response 
was statistically significantly greater in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment 
groups (63.5% and 69.6%) compared with placebo (47.2%)  
For the MIDAS total score, a patient was a responder for the specific visit if his/her percent change 
from baseline was ≥ 50% at the specific visit. The model estimated percentage of patients 
meeting this definition of response at Month 6 (where the questions were asked for the previous 
3 months of double-blind treatment) was statistically significantly greater in both the 
galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups (80.3% and 76.2%) compared with 
placebo (54.8%)

Participant flow  
Patient disposition through the DB phase (ITT population): 
Source: Study CSR 
A  total  of  1696  patients  were  screened,  922  patients  were  randomized  and  there  were  774  screen 
failures. The most common reason for screen failure was patients not meeting criteria for study enrolment 
based  on  migraine  headache  information  collected  in  the  ePRO  diary  during  the  prospective  baseline 
phase. A total of 915 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of galcanezumab and were included in 
the ITT population (n=461 patients randomized to placebo, n=231 patients randomized to galcanezumab 
120  mg,  and  n=223  patients  randomized  to  galcanezumab  240  mg).  Overall,  785  patients  (85.8%) 
completed the double-blind treatment phase (n=387 patients in the placebo arm, n=203 patients in the 
galcanezumab 120 mg arm, and n=195 patients in the galcanezumab 240 mg).

Similarly to CGAG study and in line with known epidemiological data according to which the post-pubertal 
female-to-male ratio of migraine is of 4:1, the overall patient population was predominately female 
(85.4%) and White (70.3%) with a mean age of 41.9 years. Nearly half the patients were from North 
America. Across treatment groups the demographic characteristics of sex, age, race, geographic region, 
and BMI were similarly distributed. 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
The use of preventives was not allowed during the double-blind phase, whereas at least one prior 
migraine preventive treatment was reported by 65.5% of subjects overall (64.6% in the PBO treatment 
group vs 68% and 64.6% of LY120mg and LY240mg groups, respectively, without statistically significant 
differences). Overall, the previous most frequently used medications were topiramate (23%), ibuprofen 
(13%), paracetamol (9%), sumatriptan (10%), amitriptyline hydrochloride and amitriptyline (about 5% 
each), propranolol (7.1%) thomapyrin N (6.9%), botulinum toxin type A (4.9%). Statistically significant 
treatment group differences concerned topiramate (LY120mg [28.6%] vs LY240mg [18.4%], p=.01), 
paracetamol (LY120mg [13.4%] vs placebo [8.2%], p=.04 and vs LY240mg [5.8%], p=.007), and 
amitriptyline hydrochloride (placebo [2.3%] vs. LY120mg [9.1%], p <.001, and vs LY240mg [6.7%], p= 
0.009). Within this medicines category, the overall most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation 
was inadequate response for topiramate (11.5%), amitriptyline hydrochloride, propranolol (2.6% each) 
and amitriptyline (1.9%).

Patients were allowed to start migraine prevention medications not before one month after the last visit 
of the treatment phase (Visit 12), at the discretion of the investigator if clinically warranted due to a 
worsening of symptoms. However, concomitant medications (recorded via eCRF) were used during the 
DB treatment period by the majority of subjects overall (89.8%), with the most frequent being ibuprofen, 
paracetamol, sumatriptan, Thomapyrin N, acetylsalicylic acid, ketorolac, naproxen, vitamins NOS, 
levothyroxine sodium. The most relevant statistically significant group differences regarded sumatriptan 
(placebo [13.8%] vs LY240mg [8.5%], p =.046) and salbutamol (placebo [1.74%] vs LY120mg [5.2%], 
p =.015). There was sufficient consistency between the concomitant therapies most frequently used 
during the DB treatment and those in the post-treatment periods.

Outcomes and estimation 
ePRO compliance  
Compliance with the ePRO diary is an important consideration in interpreting efficacy results derived from 
the diary. At each month during the double-blind treatment phase, a majority of patients (>80%) 
completed at least 80% of their daily diary entries. Mean compliance with the ePRO diary averaged over 
the 6-month treatment phase was similar across treatment groups (91.3% placebo, 90.9% 
galcanezumab 120 mg, 92.7% galcanezumab 240 mg).

- Sensitivity Analysis for the Primary Objective: 
Missing Data Assumptions 
Abbreviations: LY = LY2951742; N = number of intent-to-treat subjects who have non-missing baseline value and at 
least one post-baseline value. 
For each set of Delta value: MMRM Model: Change = treatment, pooled region 1/country, month, and 
treatment*month, baseline, and baseline*month. 
For each set of Delta value, the following steps were conducted 
1) Predict the missing outcomes for each treatment via multiple imputation based on observed primary endpoint and 
baseline values. 
Such imputation will be carried out using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with a Jeffery's prior via SAS PROC MI. 
30 imputations will be created. 
2) Add the corresponding delta to the imputed values based on the patient treatment group. 
3) Conduct the primary analysis separately for each of the 30 imputations. 
4) Combine the results of these analyses using Rubin's combining rules, as implemented in SAS PROC MI ANALYZE.

Normality Assumptions 
The sensitivity analysis for the raw number of MHDs (ie, the total number of MHDs for each interval 
without normalization to 30-day period) performed to assess the validity of the primary MMRM results 
with respect to deviations from normality, showed the following results: 
As a further sensitivity analysis for primary efficacy, outlier patients identified as having studentized 
residuals less than 2 at any month of the DB treatment phase were identified and excluded (n=66 for 
placebo, n=25 for LY120mg, and n=29 for LY240mg), without changing the primary efficacy results:

Response was defined as change from baseline to average of Months 4 to 6 ≥ 25. The percentages 
of  patients  meeting  this  definition  of  response  was  statistically  significantly  greater  in  both  the 
galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups (58.2% and 60.0%) compared with placebo 
(43.4%). 
A post hoc exploratory responder analysis was conducted on the PGI-S.  
Response at each visit was defined as having a severity decrease from baseline of at least 2 points 
on  the  7-point  scale  at  the  specific  visit.  The  model  estimated  mean  percentages  of  patients 
meeting this definition of response over the final 3 months of double-blind treatment (average of 
Months 4 to 6) was statistically significantly greater in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg 
treatment groups (38% and 37%) compared with placebo (29%) 
Secondary endpoints 
Several endpoints as part of the additional secondary efficacy analyses in support of the key secondary 
objectives across the DB phase were tested, which all showed significant differences in favour of both 
galcanezumab dose groups compared to placebo. No adjustment for sensitivity was considered in this 
case:

At each month, the percentages of patients with ≥50% or ≥75% reduction from baseline in MHDs were 
statistically significantly greater in both the LY120 mg and LY240mg groups compared with placebo. 
Similar results were obtained for 100% reduction from baseline in MHDs, with the exception of 1 time 
point that was not statistically significantly different between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo (Month 
3).

Onset and Maintenance of effect 
The earliest month where the statistical significance was observed and maintained for all the subsequent 
months during DB treatment phase was considered as the onset of ≥50% sustained response (key 
secondary measure of ≥50% response rate that was statistically significant), and was observed at Month 
1 for both galcanezumab treatment groups. 
A statistically significantly higher percentage of patients in each galcanezumab treatment group 
maintained the ≥50% response either for at least 3 and 6 consecutive months to the patient’s endpoint 
during the double-blind treatment phase compared with placebo: 
Abbreviations: LY = LY2951742; N = number of intent-to-treat subjects who have non-missing baseline value and at least one

phase; everyone else are non-responders, including those discontinued early within 3 months and those continued after 3 months but 
did not meet 50% response criteria for their last three months. 
6-month sustained 50% responders are defined as patients meeting 50% response criteria for all 6 months during the treatment phase; 
everyone else are non-responders, including those who discontinued early and those who completed 6-month treatment phase but did 
not meet 50% response criteria for one or more of the 6 months.

Secondary Analyses on Health Outcomes:  
Exploratory responder analyses were conducted on MIDAS total score. 
For the MIDAS total score, a patient was a responder for the specific visit if his/her percent change from 
baseline was ≥ 50% at the specific visit. The model estimated percentage of patients meeting this 
definition of response at Month 6 (where the questions were asked for the previous 3 months of 
double-blind treatment) was statistically significantly greater in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 
240-mg treatment groups (73.0% and 77.1%) compared with placebo (55.6%).  
Migraine symptoms  
Further exploratory analyses were conducted at each month and overall over the mean reductions from 
baseline in number of monthly MHDs with nausea and/or vomiting, as well as photophobia and 
phonophobia, which resulted statistically significantly greater in both galcanezumab dose treatment 
groups compared with placebo.  
Migraine with aura 
Exploratory analyses were also conducted on the overall mean reductions from baseline in number of 
monthly MHDs with aura as well as prodromal symptoms other than aura, the vast majority of which were 
statistically significantly greater at each month in both the galcanezumab dose groups compared with 
placebo.

Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy measure of change from baseline in the number of 
monthly MHDs included the following subgroup variables: 
sex, race, ethnicity, geographic region, baseline monthly MHD category, baseline treatment resistance 
status, and presence of aura (or not) at baseline. 
The statistical significance of the subgroup-by-treatment interaction was assessed at a 2-sided with 0.1 
significance level.  
Statistically significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions pertained the following subgroups variables: 
- race, p=.07 for galcanezumab 240 mg compared with placebo, due to a greater difference of LY240 mg 
versus placebo in the Asian group (-2.4 days) and White group (-2.1 days) as compared with the Other 
subgroup (-0.4 days). The applicant explains such interaction as not clinically meaningful given the higher 
placebo response observed in the Other race group, despite comparable magnitudes of change observed 
in galcanezumab treated groups at all races. 
-  geographic  region,  p=.003  for  galcanezumab  240mg  compared  with  placebo  (p=.003),  due  to 
significantly greater difference observed in European subgroup (-3.4 days) compared to North American 
(-1.2 days) and Other (-1.7 days). The applicant considered these results as clinically not meaningful 
given the low placebo response in the European subgroup.  
- presence of aura (or not) at baseline, p=.037 and p=.026 for galcanezumab 120mg and galcanezumab 
LY240mg, respectively, due to significantly greater difference observed in the subgroup without aura at 
baseline  (-2.7  days  and  -2.6  days  for  LY120mg  and  LY240mg  versus  placebo)  compared  with  the 
subgroup with aura at baseline (-1.5 days and -1.4 days). The applicant considered these results as not 
clinically meaningful given the similarity in the magnitude of change for galcanezumab-treated patients in 
patients with and without aura, that varied for placebo-treated patients in the 2 subgroups. 
There were no other statistically significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions for either galcanezumab 
dose group compared with placebo for any other subgroup variables in change from baseline in the 
number of monthly MHDs.

Study I5Q-MC-CGAI (CGAI, the REGAIN study) for chronic migraine (with or 
without aura) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
Patient and Disease Characteristics 
[1] Patients are 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of screening. 
[2] Have a diagnosis of chronic migraine as defined by the IHS ICHD-3 beta guidelines (1.3) (ICHD-3 
2013):  
A. Headache (tension-type-like and/or migraine-like) on ≥15 days per month for >3 months and 
fulfilling criteria B and C 
B. Occurring in a patient who has had at least five attacks fulfilling criteria B-D for 1.1 Migraine 
without aura and/or criteria B and C for 1.2 Migraine with aura 
C. On ≥8 days per month for >3 months, fulfilling any of the following: 
1. criteria C and D for 1.1 Migraine without aura 
2. criteria B and C for 1.2 Migraine with aura 
3. believed by the patient to be migraine at onset and relieved by a triptan or ergot derivative 
D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. 
[3] Migraine onset prior to age 50. 
[4] Prior to Visit 1, a history of at least 1 headache-free day per month for the past 3 months. 
[5] From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (prospective baseline period), have a frequency of at least 15 headache days, 
of which at least 8 must have the features of migraine headache. To avoid biased reporting, patients must 
not be told the number of migraine headache days on which study qualification is based. 
[6] From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (prospective baseline period), have at least one headache-free day. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 59/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[7] From Visit 2 to Visit 3 (prospective baseline period), must achieve sufficient compliance with ePRO 
daily headache entries as demonstrated by completion of at least 80% of daily diary entries. 
Patients also had to agree to use an acceptable contraceptive method during the study and for at least 5 
months after last dose of IMP. 
Treatments 
During the DB treatment phase, patients received galcanezumab (120 or 240 mg) or placebo 
administered once monthly by subcutaneous injection at dosing visits. Patients randomized to the 
120-mg dose received a loading dose of 240 mg (2 injections of 120 mg each at V3 only). All treatment 
groups received two 1-ml injections of IP at each dosing visit to maintain the blind (two placebo 
injections; two 120-mg galcanezumab injections; or one placebo injection and one 120-mg 
galcanezumab injection) for a total of 3 administrations during the 3-month DB treatment phase.  
During the open-label extension (ongoing) galcanezumab dosing was comprised of monthly injections at 
9 office visits. Doses administered during this phase were 240 mg at V7, 120 mg at V8, and either 120 or 
240 mg/month, thereafter, at the discretion of the investigator. Dosing and dose changes could only 
occur at regular once-monthly visits. Subcutaneous injection sites included the abdomen, thigh, upper 
arm, or buttocks. 
Objectives 
Primary, secondary and tertiary objectives with endpoints tested during the DB period of Study CGAI 
were the same as the Studies CGAG and CGAH, but tested on the shorter 3-month time period (overall 
mean change from baseline over Months 1 to 3 for most efficacy measures or mean change from baseline 
at Month 3 for measures of functioning and disability and the PGI-S).  
During the open-label period, mean changes in MHDs, functioning, disability, and rates of response and 
sustained response were evaluated. As in Studies CGAG and CGAH, an MHD was defined as a calendar 
day on which a migraine headache or probable migraine headache occurred. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs during 
the 3-month double-blind treatment phase.  
Sample size 
The sample size derived from an initially planned re-estimation procedure due to uncertainties in the 
effect size of galcanezumab in chronic migraine, ranged between a minimum of 825 patients to a  
maximum of 1140 patients. The minimum estimated sample size was based on the assumption of an 
effect size of 0.33 and a dropout rate of approximately 15%, expected to provide more than 90% power 
that at least 1 dose of LY2951742 would separate from placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 
based on simulations Dunnett test. The maximum estimate was based on the same dropout rate with an 
effect size of 0.30 in the last month of the 3-month DB phase, to provide approximately 95% power that 
at least 1 dose of galcanezumab would separate from placebo at a 1-sided 0.025 significance level.

Randomisation 
Patients who met all criteria for enrolment were randomly assigned to DB treatment group at V3 by an 
interactive web-response system (IWRS).  The stratification factors considered to achieve between-group 
comparability, were country, acute headache medication overuse (yes/no), and use of concurrent 
migraine prophylactic medication (yes/no). Acute headache medication overuse was determined during 
the prospective baseline period with diagnostic criteria adapted from Section 8.2 of the ICHD-3 beta 
guidelines (ICHD-3 2013), while taking into consideration the following drug-related thresholds 
specifications, in terms of total days of use per 30-day period of the prospective baseline as reported in 
the ePRO diary. 
Blinding (masking) 
In this double-blind study, a minimum number of the sponsor’s personnel saw the randomization table 
and treatment assignments before the study was complete. This was explained as a measure to preserve 
the blinding of the study. Emergency unblinding for AEs could be performed through the IWRS, in which 
all the unblinding events were to be recorded and reported. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy measure was the overall mean change from the baseline period in the number of 
monthly migraine headache days during the 3-month double-blind treatment phase, and the primary 
analysis evaluated the efficacy of galcanezumab (LY120 or LY240 mg/month) compared with placebo. 
The primary analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed models 
repeated measures (MMRM) technique and includes the fixed categorical effects of treatment, pooled 
country, medication overuse (yes/no), concomitant prophylaxis use (yes/no), month, and 
treatment-by-month interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline number of 
migraine headache days and baseline number of migraine headache days-by-month interaction. Visitwise 
binary efficacy variables were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX) as 
pseudo-likelihood-based mixed effects repeated measures analysis.

Baseline data 
The patient population was predominantly female (85.0%), White (79.1%), and from North America 
(57.6%). The overall mean age was 41.0 years although the LY120-mg group was statistically 
significantly younger than the placebo group (39.7 vs. 41.6 years, p=.027). Sex, age, race, and BMI were 
generally similar across treatment groups.

With regard to disease characteristics, out of an average of 21.4 headache days per month, the overall 
mean number of MHDs was 19.4, with comparable distributions among groups. Average number of 
migraine headache hours per month was 136.0 and average number of migraine attacks per month was 
6.3. Within the ITT population, the proportion of patients reporting migraine with or without aura at 
baseline (as measured in the last 7 days) was slightly in favour of the former type (54.2% vs 45.7% 
overall, without significant differences among treatment groups). 
An average of 15.2 MHDs per month included any acute headache medication use and, of these, an 
average of 9.4 MHDs per month included triptan use (ranging from 0 to 29 MHDs per month). Criteria for 
medication overuse regarded 63.8% of patients overall, and the majority of patients (77.8%) reported 
using prior migraine preventive treatment, with 29.5% having failed 2 or more such treatments due to 
CHMP assessment report

lack of efficacy in the past 5 years, with higher proportions in the LY-240mg group (35.0%) with respect 
to placebo and LY-120mg group (29.2% and 24.5%, respectively). Although the protocol allowed for up 
to one-third of patients to continue on a stable dose of either topiramate or propranolol for concurrent 
migraine prophylaxis during the study, only 14.6% of patients elected to do so, with most of those on 
topiramate (10.3%) rather than propranolol (4.3%). 
No statistically significant differences were observed regarding the overall mean of the number of 
migraine headache days with ergots use (n=0.67) , anti-nausea medication use (n=1.9), migraine 
headache hours (n=136.04 overall), migraine attacks (n=6.31), number of moderate-severe headache 
days (n=16.5), headache hours (n=145.17), ICHD migraine headache days (n=16.48), mean severity of 
migraine headaches (2.16), number of migraine days with aura (n=5.03).  
However, statistically significant differences were observed for the following baseline characteristics:  
- years since migraine diagnosis, higher in the placebo group  with respect to LY240mg (mean values 22 
years vs 20.1 years, respectively, p=.046) and LY_overall (mean 20.2 years, p=.024); 
-number of migraine headache days with abortive medication use (15.51 for placebo, 14.5 for LY240mg, 
p=.031); 
- number of migraine headache days with:  
▫ NSAIDS/Aspirin Use (12.24 for placebo, 11.32 and 10.88 for LY240mg and LY120mg, 
respectively, p=.028); 
▫ Acetaminophen/Paracetamol Use (7.83 for placebo vs 6.34 for LY240mg, p=.022 and LY120mg 
(8.19) vs LY240mg, p=.013);  
- number of migraine headache days with nausea or vomiting in the placebo vs LY240mg groups (9.21 vs 
8.13, p=.028, respectively)   
- number of migraine headache days with photophobia or phonophobia in the placebo vs LY240mg groups 
(15.18 vs 13.98, p=.025, respectively). 
The mean overall values of the measures of functioning, disability, and migraine disease state severity at 
baseline, including respectively MSQ Role-Function Restrictive score (38.7), total MIDAS score (67.2) and 
Mean PGI-S (4.9) were consistent with a chronic migraine population, without statistically significant 
differences observed among treatment groups  
The most common preexisting conditions (≥10%) were seasonal allergy, drug hypersensitivity, insomnia, 
depression, anxiety, and back pain. 
At least one prior migraine preventive treatment was reported by 77.8% of subjects overall (77.9% 
in the PBO treatment group vs 75.9% and 79.4% of LY120mg and 240mg groups, respectively, without 
statistically significant differences), with 29.5% having failed 2 or more such treatments due to lack of 
efficacy in the past 5 years. Among such treatments, the overall most commonly reported were 
topiramate (34.7%), amitriptyline (14.9%), propranolol (14.6%), ibuprofen (14.0%), botulinum toxin 
type A (12.9%), sumatriptan (10.3%), paracetamol (7.7%), thomapyrin N (7.2%), valproate sodium 
(5.8%), amitriptyline hydrochloride (5.9%), and nortriptyline (5.0%) without significant differences 
among treatment groups except for topiramate (placebo [35.8%] vs LY120mg [28.4%], p=.036). The 
most commonly reported reason for their discontinuation was inadequate response, followed by no 
response and medical history event, without statistically significant intergroup differences.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018

Concomitant Medication 
The vast majority of all subjects reported at least one concomitant medications (89.8%, without 
statistically significant treatment group differences), the most commonly overall reported being ibuprofen 
(23.6%), paracetamol (16.0%), sumatriptan (11.9%), topiramate (10.3%), thomapyrin N (8.5%), 
without relevant significant differences even with other medications at much lower subject proportions. 
The above medications were also among the most frequently reported in the OL treatment phase (study 
period IV). 
The concomitant medications used for the acute treatment of migraine as recorded by patients in the 
ePRO diary were accounted for as an efficacy measure (see later on for details). 
With regard to the open-label treatment phase, as of the cutoff date 87.4% of patients used a 
concomitant therapy, with the most frequently used concomitant medications being ibuprofen (25.1%), 
paracetamol (15.6%), sumatriptan  (12.6%), topiramate (10.2%), thomapyrin N (8.1%), with the 
exception of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and vitamin D NOS that were more frequently used (5.8% 
5.0% overall, respectively. 
• 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 1113 patients in the ITT population, 1085 patients with nonmissing change in MHDs were analyzed 
for the primary efficacy measure.  
In addition to presenting efficacy analyses from the completed 3-month double-blind treatment phase, 
some efficacy analyses containing up to 6 months of OL (ie, up to Month 9) were included by the

Effect size for change in migraine headache days:  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary objective 
- Sensitivity analysis for missing data assumptions 
The  potential impact of missing data assumptions was assessed by a series of worst-case scenarios 
analyses around the distribution of missing outcome data (missing outcome values imputed to be worse 
than expected, with no treatment benefit at all seen in missing outcomes data, i.e. delta method).  In 
total, 9 sets of delta were used and the results were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. 
-Sensitivity analysis for normality assumption 
To assess the validity of the primary MMRM results with respect to deviations from normality  assumption, 
a sensitivity analysis for the raw number of MHDs (ie, the total number of MHDs for  each interval without 
normalization to 30-day period) was conducted with a repeated measures  negative binomial regression 
analysis.  The results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis 
(p<.001 at all comparisons of placebo vs both galcanezumab treated groups at each month). 
A further sensitivity analysis was conducted on the studentized residuals from the primary analysis 
model, i.e. patients with outlier residuals removed. The outlier patients were 43 for placebo, 21 for 
LY120-mg, and 36 for LY240-mg.  The results were consistent before and after removing patients with 
outlier residuals (p<.001 in the difference among both galcanezumab treated groups vs placebo).  
- Post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding patients with an eligibility related important protocol deviation 
There were 36 ITT patients who were inadvertently enrolled and identified as having an important 
protocol deviation of inclusion/exclusion criteria not being met. Their exclusion did not modify the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
- Post hoc sensitivity analysis using IWRS stratification factors for baseline medication overuse and 
concurrent prophylaxis use 
There were 65 ITT patients with stratification errors for either baseline medication overuse or concurrent 
prophylaxis use, identified as having an important protocol deviation. After removing those subjects, the 
results of were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis.

50%, 75%, and 100% Response Rate and NNT. ITT population 
Exploratory responder analyses of MSQ Role function-restrictive domain 
Response for the MSQ Role Function-Restrictive domain was defined as a change from baseline to Month 
3 ≥17.14 points on the transformed 100-point scale, corresponding  to a change of 6 points on the raw 
scale. There were statistically significantly greater percentages of patients meeting this definition of 
response in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups (64.3% and 64.8%, p=.003 
and p=.002, respectively) compared with placebo (54.1%). 
PGI-S 
The overall mean reduction (improvement across Months 1 to 3) from baseline in PGI-S was significantly 
greater only in the LY240-mg treatment group compared with placebo (LS Mean change from baseline 
-0.48 for placebo vs -0.73 for LY-240mg treatment groups, p=.002), as well as at each month for such a 
dose. No statistically significant differences between the lower galcanezumab dose and placebo in the 
mean change in PGI-S rating were found at any month or overall. 
Post hoc exploratory responder analysis for PGI-S 
The analysis was conducted through a model estimating, at Month 3 of the DB treatment period, the 
percentages of patients meeting the definition of PGI-S response (i.e., those who at the specific visit had 
a  severity  decrease  from  baseline  of  at  least  2  points  on  the  7-point  scale)  were  not  statistically 
significantly  different  between  the  two  galcanezumab  dose  treatment  groups  (23.8%  and  25.1%,  for 
LY120-mg  and  LY240-mg,  respectively)  compared  to  placebo  (19.5%),  with  p=.15  and  p=.062, 
respectively.  Statistically significant differences were found overall 3 months in both the galcanezumab 
120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups (p=.048 and p=.014, respectively) compared to placebo.

and for categorical measures:  
Onset and maintenance of treatment effect  
Both galcanezumab dose treatment groups reported significantly higher proportions compared to placebo 
at each month (p<.001) and at month 3 in the proportion of patients with 50% reduction from baseline, 
(with proportions 22.4%, 31.9%, and 34.0% for placebo, galcanezumab 120-mg and galcanezumab 
240-mg treatment groups, respectively), and as such onset of treatment effect for the assessment of 
maintenance of efficacy was set at month 1.  
CHMP assessment report

Page 73/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When evaluated across all patients in the ITT population, a statistically significantly higher percentage of 
patients who maintained ≥50% response for all 3 months of the DB treatment phase was observed in 
each galcanezumab treatment group (16.9% and 14.6% for those on 120-mg and 240-mg, respectively) 
vs placebo (6.3%, p<.001 at both comparisons). 
The distribution of response rates (i.e., the mean percentage of patients with different levels of reduction 
from baseline in monthly MHDs but over the 3-month double-blind treatment phase, based on estimates 
from a GLMM) is depicted in the graph below.  
Health outcomes measures (MSQ v2.1, MIDAS, HCRU and Employment Status) 
- The MSQ, Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and employment status assessments were 
administered at baseline and monthly postbaseline visits, while the MIDAS was administered at baseline 
and Month 3 (the results from the multiple testing procedure for the MSQ Role Function-Restrictive are

An overall greater mean improvement in patients’ perception of their level of disability due to migraine as 
suggested by the MIDAS total score was statistically significantly different superior only for 
Galcanezumab 120 mg group (p=.025). 
- Looking at the individual items of the MIDAS at the Month 3 assessment, a statistically significantly 
greater mean improvement from baseline for galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups 
compared with placebo was observed on Q3 (number of days of missed household work [p=.019 and 
p=.036, respectively]), Q-A (number of days with headache [p=<.001 and p=.001, respectively]), and 
Q-B (pain score of headache, [both p<.001 versus placebo]). 
- With regard to HRCU during the DB period (including change from baseline of the following: number of 
emergency room visits, number of times admitted to hospital, number of overnight hospital stays, 
number of other healthcare professional visits, number of healthcare professional visits related to 
migraine, number of other healthcare professional visits related to migraine), there were neither 
statistically significant differences between either galcanezumab treatment group and placebo for any of 
the above measures, nor significant changes in employment status during the pre-baseline to 
post-baseline period.  
Exploratory responder analyses were conducted on MIDAS total score. 
For the MIDAS total score, response was defined as having ≥50% improvement from baseline to Month 
3. The model estimated percentages of patients meeting this definition of response at Month 3 was 
statistically significantly greater in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups 
(48.8% and 45.0%) compared with placebo (35.8%).

Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory efficacy analyses 
- Changes in migraine symptoms 
At each month and overall, the mean reductions from baseline in number of monthly MHDs with nausea 
and/or vomiting, as well as photophobia and phonophobia, were statistically significantly greater in both 
the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups compared with placebo.  
-Migraine with aura 
At each month and overall, the mean reductions from baseline in number of monthly MHDs with aura were 
not statistically significantly different in either of the galcanezumab treatment groups compared with 
placebo. The mean reduction from baseline in number of monthly MHDs with prodromal symptoms other 
than aura was statistically significantly greater in both of the galcanezumab treatment groups compared 
with placebo overall and at each month except for Months 1 and 2 for the LY120-mg treatment group. 
- Patients who failed previous prophylactic treatments 
In patients who failed one or more prophylactic treatments for efficacy reasons, the treatment difference 
for the reduction of mean monthly MHDs observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo was 
-3.54 days (p < 0.001) and between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo -1.37 days (p < 0.05). In 
patients failing two or more prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference was -4.48 days 
(p < 0.001) between 120 mg and placebo and -1.86 days (p < 0.01) between 240 mg and placebo. 
OPEN-LABEL treatment phase 
• 
Numbers analysed and ePRO Compliance 
As of the data cutoff date of 16 March 2017, a total of 795 patients had evaluable ePRO diary data at 
Month 6 (397 placebo/LY; 194 LY120mg/LY; 204 LY240mg/LY), 447 had such data at Month 9 (228 
placebo/LY; 108 LY120mg/LY; 111 LY240mg/LY), and 145 had such data at Month 12 (77 placebo/LY; 34 
LY120mg/LY; 34 LY240mg/LY). On average, 84% of all patients in the three treatment groups had daily 
diary compliance ≥80% through Month 10, and approximately 81% of them were ≥80% compliant at 
Months 12. 
As of the cutoff date 16 Mar 2017, according to the Table CGAI.14.79 neither the overall proportions of 
patients with evaluable ePRO diary data at each assigned group nor the proportions of compliant subjects 
at month level correspond to the figures indicated in the body text of study CGAI. The applicant should 
provide explanations for such a discrepancy, indicating which are the figures to be considered and if any 
potential implication for the interpretation of study data is derived from this apparent confusion (OC). 
Primary and key secondary endpoints of change in MHDs 
- Reduction in Number of Migraine Headache Days 
The repeated measures analysis of change in the number of monthly MHDs on the full 9 months period 
(i.e., data from the 3 months DB and ongoing 6 months OL) showed the following results:

Page 77/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the dosing scheme adopted in the OL phase and to maintain the blinding to previous 
treatment group, at the last visit of DB period (V7, Month 3) all patients received a LY240-mg loading 
dose (2 injections), and then all patients were started on the 120-mg maintenance dose (1 
injection) at the first visit of OL period (V8, Month 4) to encourage use of the lower dose. Starting at V9 
(Month 5), patients were flexibly dosed (1 or 2 injections) at the investigator’s discretion, resulting in 
64.3% of patients switched to the LY240-mg dose, and up to 75.8% of patients receiving the 240-mg 
dose thereafter.  
- Response Analyses Based on Reduction in Migraine Headache Days 
Proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in monthly MHDs was analyzed using repeated 
measures  methodology  on  the  data  from  the  completed  double-blind  and  ongoing  openlabel  phases 
combined up to Month 9. 
Maintenance of response during the open-label treatment phase was evaluated using different definitions 
and subsets of patients. An analysis for maintenance of response defined by meeting ≥50% response at 
any time and subsequently maintaining ≥40% response until each patient’s endpoint was conducted 
through 6 months of open-label treatment:

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The efficacy data from the two identical studies CGAG and CGAH on EM were integrated in an Episodic 
Migraine Integrated Analysis Set (also referred to as the Episodic Integrated Analysis Set), which included 
patient demographics and baseline characteristics, patient disposition, mean change from baseline in 
monthly MHDs, and number of weekly MHDs during first month of treatment, using the same methods as 
for each of the two parent studies.  
After reviewing data from pivotal studies, dose regimens of galcanezumab were superior to placebo on 
the primary measure of overall mean reduction in monthly MHDs across Months 1 to 6 (for CGAG and 
CGAH) and Months 1 to 3 (for CGAI study on CM). Both doses also were superior to placebo on all key 
secondary and nearly all other secondary endpoints, with no statistically significant differences between 
the 2 dose regimens. The consistency of results observed at each of the two studies did not change the 
outcomes of the pooled analyses.

The effects of various demographic and baseline characteristics on treatment outcome, planned subgroup 
analyses were presented for the Episodic Integrated Analysis Set (Studies CGAG and CGAH) and for Study 
CGAI. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs for 
subgroups. Overall, these analyses did not show significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions by sex, 
racial group, ethnicity, number of MHDs at baseline, concurrent prophylaxis use, or baseline medication 
overuse. The significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions observed in the remaining analyses seemed 
to be driven more by variations in placebo response across subgroups than by variations in galcanezumab 
response across subgroups. Overall these analyses indicated that efficacy was not different in patients 
with a history of failure with multiple prophylactic treatment for their migraine. 
For patients in the Episodic Integrated Analysis Set both doses of galcanezumab were equally effective in 
mean change of the monthly MHD in patients with aura as well as in patients without aura. There was a 
statistically significant dose interaction in Study CGAI, in which patients with aura did better with the 240 
mg dose while patients without aura did better with the 120 mg dose (p=0.016). Patients who did not 
take prior prophylactic treatment in the CGAI study responded better to the 240 mg dose (-7.57) 
compared to the 120 mg dose (-4.56) of galcanezumab. 
In the Episodic Integrated Analysis Set the mean change from baseline in number of MHD for patients 
with <8 MHD at baseline overall was -0.96 for placebo, -2.76 for 120 mg dose and -2.28 for 240 mg dose 
with respective difference from placebo for 120 mg dose in 1.84 (p<0.001) and 1.36 MHD (p<0.001) for 
240 mg dose. The mean change from baseline in number of MHD for patients with ≥8 MHD at baseline 
overall was -3.4 for placebo, -5.43 for 120 mg dose and -5.46 for 240 mg dose with difference from

placebo for 120 mg dose in 2.04 MHD (p<.001) and for 240 mg dose in 2.06 MHD (p<0.001) in the 
Episodic Integrated Analysis Set.  
For the subset of patients who were using concurrent topiramate or propranolol, the overall mean 
reduction in the number of monthly MHDs across Months 1 to 3 was -1.41 for placebo (N=80) versus 
-2.27 for galcanezumab 120 mg (N=37) and -2.58 for galcanezumab 240 mg (N=41) with difference from 
placebo 0.86 for 120 mg (p=0.422) and 1.18 from 240 mg dose (p=0.242). Meanwhile, for patients who 
were not using concurrent topiramate or propranolol, the overall mean reduction in the number of 
monthly MHDs across Months 1 to 3 was -3.34 for placebo versus –5.66 for 120 mg and -5.42 for 240 mg 
dose with difference from placebo 2.32 for 120 mg (p<0.001) and 2.08 from 240 mg dose (p<0.001). 
Supportive studies 
Study ART-01  
This was a phase 2a, proof-of-concept, randomized, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
performed in U.S. and aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of galcanezumab (LY2951742) in the 
prevention of episodic migraine in patients suffering from migraine headache with or without aura over a 
3-month period. 
This brief study lasted from 28 Jun 2013 (first subject first visit) to 15 Sep 2013 (last subject last visit). 
Subjects received every 14 days 1 SC injections (in the abdominal region) of placebo or LY2951742 150 
mg made up to 1.5mL with sterile water over a 12-week treatment period (totalling 900 mg of IMP or 
placebo), with the actual date and time of all dose administrations recorded in the subject's eCRF.  
The study comprised 4 study periods, namely a screening and Washout (5–45 days), a baseline (28–38 
days), a treatment (12 weeks) and a follow-up period (12 weeks). 
Primary efficacy objectives was to evaluate the mean change from baseline in the number of migraine 
headache days in a 28-day period, being a migraine headache day defined as any calendar day with a 
headache lasting >30 minutes that met the criteria for migraine as defined by IHS ICHD–II (1.1 and 1.2) 
(ICHD–II, Cephalalgia 2004). Migraine headache should have started at least 1 year prior to enrollment, 
its onset prior to age 50, and a frequency of 4 to 14 migraine headache days per 28-day period as 
determined during the Baseline Period. 
Secondary endpoints were the following: (i) the mean change from baseline in the number of headache 
days per 28-day period (being a headache day defined as any calendar day with a headache lasting ≥4 
hours, to include migraine, probable migraine and non-migraine headaches); (ii) the mean change from 
baseline in number of migraine attacks per 28-day period (migraine attack defined as beginning on any 
day a migraine headache day was recorded and ending when a migraine headache-free day occurred); 
(iii) mean change from baseline in the number of probable migraine and migraine headache days 
(combined) in a 28-day period; (iv) proportion of responders (being a responder defined as a subject who 
had a >50% reduction in the number of migraine headache days in a 28-day period; (v) occurrence of 
AEs, and changes from baseline in vital signs, safety laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms  (ECGs). In 
addition, the immunogenicity of LY2951742 was determined. 
A total of 367 patients entered the study for the 4-week Baseline Period and 115 were not considered 
eligible.  Migraine prevention medications had to be discontinued at least 30 days prior to entering the 
Baseline Period (the washout period was 120-day for botulinum toxin), during which the eligibility of 
patients enrollment was assessed. Overall, 149 patients were excluded after the Baseline Period, 218

were enrolled into the study (n=108 on IMP and n=110 on placebo) and randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis 
to either placebo or LY2951742 150 mg administered (at Visit 3 for the first time) on an out-patient basis 
as a SC injection once every 14 days for a 12-week period (6 SC totally injected doses per subject). 
Results 
In a 28-day cycle, the mean (±SD) number of migraine headache days recorded during the Baseline 
Period in subjects enrolled into the study (n=217) was 6.90 (±2.42). When compared with placebo, 
LY2951742 treatment significantly reduced the number of MHD over the 12-week treatment period in the 
ITT population (4.19 vs. 2.96 days for the LY2951742 and the placebo groups, respectively, p=0.003) as 
well as the PP population (4.22 vs. 2.95 days for the LY2951742 and the placebo groups, respectively, 
p=0.002). Similar results were obtained from the sensitivity analyses. 
Subcutaneous administration of LY2951742 at a dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks was effective in reducing 
the number of migraine headache days, headache days, headache hours, and the number of migraine 
attacks in patients with frequent, episodic migraine. 
In about one-third of subjects, LY2951742 treatment resulted in a total elimination of migraine 
headaches.  
Odds ratio estimates confirmed that LY2951742 treatment was superior to placebo for 100%, 75% and 
50% response rates in each treatment month of the Treatment Period. 
The number of subjects that achieved a 100% or 75% reduction in migraine headaches was highest in the 
second month of LY2951742 treatment whereas the number of subjects that achieved a >50% response 
was highest in the third 065. 
Study CGAJ  
This was a Phase 3, long-term, randomized study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
galcanezumab (120 mg/month and 240 mg/month) during a 12-month open-label treatment period in 
patients with EM or CM. The majority of patients in the study had episodic migraine (78.9%), with an 
overall mean of 10.6 monthly MHDs at baseline, with baseline means of 9.8 and 13.6 for the EM and CM 
subsets, respectively. The patient population was predominantly female (82.6%) and white (78.2%) with 
a mean age of 42.0 years. The mean MIDAS score at baseline for the entire population was 49.9, with 
means of 47.6 for the episodic migraine subset and 58.5 for the chronic migraine subset. In this study, 
5.9% of patients were age 60 or higher at baseline.  
A total of 270 patients participated, equally distributed among the two treatment groups. Overall, 210 
patients (77.8%) completed the 12-month open-label treatment period (71.9% of patients in the 120 mg 
group and 83.7% of patients in the 240 mg group). The proportion of patients who discontinued due to 
lack of efficacy was 9.6% and 3.7% in the 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups, respectively. The 
proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse event was 5.2% and 4.4% in the 120 mg and 
240 mg treatment groups, respectively. 
Baseline MIDAS scores were numerically higher for the 240-mg group compared to the 120-mg group 
(MIDAS total score 54.0 vs. 45.8)

Efficacy measures were secondary in this study. The overall mean reduction from baseline in the number 
of monthly MHDs averaged over the 12-month open-label treatment phase was 5.6 days for 
galcanezumab 120 mg and 6.5 days for galcanezumab 240 mg. Compared to baseline, MHDs (120-mg 
treatment group = 9.7 days per month; 240-mg treatment group = 11.4 days per month), results in both 
groups showed statistically significant reductions in mean number of MHDs at each month during the 
12-month open-label treatment phase. 
Results of response rate analyses demonstrated that the mean percentage of patients in the   
galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups with a ≥50% reduction in the number of monthly 
MHDs was 65.6% and 73.7%, respectively, during the 12-month open-label treatment phase. The mean 
percentage of patients in the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups, respectively, with 
≥30% reduction in the number of monthly MHDs was 76.1% and 80.9%, with ≥75% reduction in the 
number of monthly MHDs was 44.5% and 52.5%, and with 100% reduction in the number of monthly 
MHDs was 21.4% and 21.8%.  
The overall mean reduction in number of monthly days that patients took any acute medications for 
migraines or headaches was 5.1 days in both the galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg treatment groups. 
The high percentage of patients who received concomitant triptans during the trial (63% GMB 120 mg 
group and 72% in GMB 240 mg/ group), compared to around 26% of concomitant triptan use in GMB 
treated subjects in Analysis set A (who gathers all the placebo-controlled subjects of the phase 3 pivotal 
trials) was due to the different ways in which the information on acute medication use was collected (as 
prospective daily patient diary in the Analyses Set A, against a written track on daily basis taken by 
patients in study CGAJ and then enquired at each subsequent site visit along with the count of the number 
of MHD/headache days with/out acute medication in the past 30 days). Such a difference prevents to 
make a direct comparison. 
Significant and clinically meaningful improvement was also demonstrated on the PGI-I, a global rating of 
how patients perceive improvement in their migraine disease. A majority of patients reported that their 
migraine headache condition felt “very much better” and “much better” beginning at Month 1. 
Maintenance of Response 
Maintenance of response was evaluated based on the definition of a patient meeting ≥ 50% response at 
a single month and subsequently maintaining ≥ 40% response until the patient’s endpoint for at least 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 consecutive months (including initial month). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 91/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notable percentages of patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg maintained their response 
for at least 3 and up to 12 months (for patients treated with 240 mg and 120 mg, 59% and 55%, 
respectively, maintained ≥ 40% response for at least 4 months; and 35% and 24%, respectively, 
maintained this level of response for 12 months). 
Immunogenicity 
In the Phase 3 migraine clinical trials, the incidence of ADA and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) at baseline 
ranged from 7.6% to 8.4% and 4.7% to 5.5%, respectively. The majority of patients with ADA present at 
baseline did not become TE ADA+ during treatment. Based on Phase 3 data, incidence of TE ADA while on 
galcanezumab treatment ranged from 2.6% in the 3-month double-blind treatment phase of Study CGAI 
(2.7% in 120 mg group; 2.6% in 240 mg group) to 9.5% in the 12-month open-label treatment phase of 
Study CGAJ (12.5% in 120 mg group; 6.6% in 240 mg group). The majority of patients who were TE 
ADA+ had NAb present.

Study CGAB, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study that tested galcanezumab at doses of 
5, 50, 120, 300 mg given sc every 4 weeks, with the primary objective to assess whether at least 1 dose 
of galcanezumab was superior to placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine. The primary endpoint was the 
mean change from baseline in the number of MHDs in the last 28-day period of the 12-week treatment 
phase. CGAB enrolled patients who met criteria for episodic migraine, as defined by IHS ICHD-3 beta. 
Despite apparent similarity in reduction of MHDs during last 28 days between 5 mg and 300 mg dose, 
there was no statistically significant difference from placebo in reduction of MHDs at any timepoint for 5 
mg dose group. However, the totality of presented data including analysis of relationship of 
galcanezumab serum concentration and mean change from baseline of number of MHDs, suggested that 
both 120 mg and 300 mg tested doses had similar efficacy, thus supporting dose selection for phase 3 
pivotal studies. An earlier significantly higher response (at month 1) than placebo was shown for the 300 
mg dose. This suggested to implement the 240-mg loading dose in Phase 3 trials in order to achieve 
steady-state galcanezumab concentrations by Month 1.  The design and conduct of this study is 
considered adequate to support the selection of the galcanezumab doses for the 3 pivotal studies. 
Pivotal Studies in EM (CGAG and CGAH) 
The two studies in episodic migraine had identical design (including a screening period, a prospective 
30-40 day baseline phase aimed at assessing the final eligibility to the study, and a double-blind period of 
6 months). In addition, a 4-month post-treatment phase was also included.  
The 2 studies did not include an active comparator.  Response rates to placebo in migraine pts are known 
to be highly variable, and this is the reason why the CHMP Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal 
Products for the Treatment of Migraine (CPMP/EWP/788/01 Rev1.) recommends 3 treatment arms with 
an active comparator and placebo for internal validation.  All patients had to have between 4 and 14 MHDs 
prior to visit 1 and at least 2 migraine attacks per month during prospective baseline period; however,

although the claimed indication included all migraine patients with no limits in terms of MHDs per month, 
the use of galcanezumab for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults should be limited to subjects who have 
at least 4 migraine days per month.  
The primary endpoint was overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs, which is 
acceptable as already used in other studies in migraine patients and may facilitate indirect comparison. 
The definition of MHD, as study endpoint and baseline criteria, included both migraine and probable 
migraine with a duration being considerably shorter than in the ICHD guideline, i.e. minimum 30 min 
untreated vs minimum 4 hours untreated. The reason for which being the need to not delay the use of 
acute medication for pain. The inclusion of probable migraine in the primary endpoint aims, according to 
the Applicant, at allowing the inclusion of episodes that do not become a full-blown migraine because of 
the use of acute medications. Although this may be acceptable, consistency of treatment effect in terms 
of both migraine and probable migraine headaches needs to be demonstrated, by separate analyses. In 
this regard, the Applicant’s choice to have ICHD MHD (not including probable headache) among 
secondary endpoints is acknowledged. The results on the primary endpoint, as well as of the responder 
analysis, were confirmed by sensitivity analyses after using alternative definitions of migraine headache 
in terms of duration of the migraine episode, i.e.  2, 3 and 4 hours, being the 1-hour length included in the 
minimum 30 min definition of MHD. Secondary endpoints (key secondary and secondary) assessed mean 
change from baseline for numerous headache parameters, which are standard measurements of 
treatment effect for this pathology. Treatment effect on quality of life was also evaluated among key 
secondary endpoints, using a validated self-administered health status instrument, the Migraine-Specific 
Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 2.1 (MSQ; Jhingran et al. 1998). The post-hoc change made on the 
threshold used for the responder analysis based on MSQ (from the initially planned cutoff ≥10.9 to the 
more restrictive ≥25 from baseline) which included both anchor and distribution-based methods was 
acceptable. It was confirmed that clinically meaningful changes in functioning were correlated with 
clinically meaningful improvements, also in the other relevant patient-reported measures used, like the 
Migraine Disability Assessment test (MIDAS) and the patient global impression of illness severity, PGI-S. 
There was rather high screening failure observed in both CGAG and CGAH studies. Approximately 48% 
(n=809) patients failed screening in the CGAG study and 45% (n=774) failed screening in CGAH. The 
most common reason for screen failure was patients not meeting criteria for study enrolment based on 
migraine headache information collected in the ePRO diary during the prospective baseline phase. 
Pivotal study in Chronic migraine, CGAI. 
The CGAI study evaluated efficacy of galcanezumab in patients with chronic migraine defined by 15 or 
more headaches days per month (with at least 8 days having features of migraine) and at least 1 
headache-free day per month for more than 3 months. The frequency of chronic migraine attacks had to 
be confirmed during the prospective baseline period of the study. 
The design of the CGAI study is similar to that of Phase 3 episodic migraine Studies CGAG and CGAH. The 
key difference in study design is that the chronic migraine study had a shorter double-blind treatment 
period (3 months) to minimize the duration of exposure of this more severely ill patient population to 
placebo, and a flexibly dosed 9-month open-label extension to allow for assessment of durability of drug 
effect. The duration of the study is acceptable. However, the preventive treatment (topiramate and 
propranolol) allowed in the CGAI study, characterized by different route (per os) and frequency of 
administration (daily) prevented the applicant from running active comparator studies. 
CM were stratified by country and acute headache medication overuse. It is noted that the exclusion 
criterion: past history of opioids or barbiturate containing analgesics >3 X per month for the treatment of 
pain in more than 2 of the past 6 months is far more restrictive than the definition of medication overuse

headache adopted in the ICHD-IIIβ (“overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication on 10 or 
more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication,  for more than 3 months”), and 
harbors the risk of narrowing the chance to enroll patients with real CM, given the known high rate of use 
among them. The CHMP queried the percentage of patients in the ITT population with CM with previous 
use of opioids seems very low, raising doubts on the representativeness of the trial population in terms of 
the target population of the claimed indication.In this regard, it was clarified that the applicant’s intention 
was to limit as much as possible the enrolment of habitual opioid/barbiturate users, as it is acknowledged 
that the use of these drug class is accompanied with a higher risk of addiction/withdrawal syndrome, 
rebound headache and difficulty to be discontinued once initiated. After reviewing the applicant’s 
response, the CHMP agreed that the study population in CGAI was representative of the EU population. 
The SAP initially included only the effect size, without details of the sample size and power calculation, or 
information on the expected treatment effect and relative SD for the three pivotal studies. The Applicant 
clarified that the assumptions for the determination of the sample size in the EM trials were a mean 
difference of 1.2 migraine headache days with a SD of 3.6 (corresponding to an effect size of 0.33). In 
study CGAI, a minimum sample size of 825 was planned based on results from Studies ART-01 and CGAB 
in episodic migraine, however, due to uncertainty of the effect size of galcanezumab in chronic migraine, 
an unblinded sample size re-estimation (SSR) approach was planned to appropriately size the study. In 
the end, a faster than expected enrolment rendered the application of such an approach unrealistic. 
Therefore, the Study CGAI team directly increased the study sample size to the predefined maximum 
sample size of 1140. In addition, the Applicant clarified that the choice to increase the sample size was 
also based on further external (though not provided) data from chronic migraine patients that indicated 
a smaller effect size than the one initially supposed. The applicant did not discuss the minimum detectable 
difference as requested, instead performed the primary analysis on the first 825 enrolled patient, in order 
to simulate what would have been resulted according the minimum estimated sample size. The provided 
“sensitivity” analysis further showed that, with selected sample size, highly statistically significant 
differences versus placebo could be observed even for very small (<1 MHD) improvements (as also 
reflected by negligible LS mean differences). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study CGAG 
The demographic characteristics at baseline were comparable among treatment groups and showed that 
the patient population was predominately female (83.7%) and White (80.4%) with a mean age of 40.7 
years. The mean duration of migraine illness was about 20 years in all groups.  Approximately 66% of 
patients had migraine frequency at baseline of ≥8 MHDs per month. Mean MHDs per month (including 
both migraine and probable migraine HDs) were substantially similar in all treatment groups: roughly 9 
MHDs per month. At least one prior migraine preventive treatment was reported by approximately 60% 
of subjects in all treatment groups. The proportions of subjects who failed 2 or more such treatments due 
to lack of efficacy in the previous 5 years were comparable among treatment groups (5.1% placebo and 
4.7% each galcanezumab treatment group).   
Based on monthly MHD, clinical history and mean severity of migraine, the patient population seems to be 
affected by a moderate to severe disease with an extreme variable impact on patients’ functioning (mean 
MIDAS total score was 33, with high SD).  
Overall, approximately half of patients in each treatment group had migraine with aura at baseline, 
without statistically significant intergroup differences.  
Similar number of patients (17-19%) discontinued the double-blind phase of the study.

The primary endpoint was met with high statistical significance at both galcanezumab doses of 120 mg 
and 240 mg SC once monthly. This result remained consistent after running different sensitivity analyses.  
After multiplicity adjustment, LS mean changes form baseline were -2.81 for placebo versus -4.73 for 
galcanezumab 120 mg [effect size -0.59] and -4.57 for galcanezumab 240 mg [effect size -0.54]). The LS 
mean difference from placebo for the 120 mg dose was 1.92 (SE 0.28), whereas that for the 240 mg dose 
was 1.76 (SE 0.28).  The magnitude of treatment effect seems limited; however, it is acknowledged that 
there is no agreed minimal clinically relevant effect in terms of decrease in MHD in the literature or in the 
clinical practice. Thus, a sound assessment of the relevance of treatment effect in terms of the primary 
endpoint is difficult at present. The applicant has provided tabulated indirect comparison data with 
available treatments in order to contextualise treatment benefit. Overall, galcanezumab treatment effect 
seems comparable with that of other approved therapies in EM. However, although the Applicant’s efforts 
are appreciated, the indirect comparison is not supported by a sound methodology, and its usefulness for 
the evaluation of treatment benefit is limited.  
After multiplicity adjustment all key secondary objectives were met without significant differences 
between the 2 galcanezumab doses. They included the responder analysis for patients with ≥50% (61% 
vs 39% placebo), ≥75% (38.5% vs 19%), and 100% reduction (15% vs 6%), a stricter definition of MHD 
including any day with acute medication use, as well as PGI-S scores and MSQ function-restrictive.  
As the change in MHDs with acute medication is considered irrespective of the total number of migraine 
days, the above data did not allow to infer if treatment effect induces a statistically significant reduction 
in acute medication use relative to total MHDs. The requested descriptive data of drug consumption for 
acute treatment totalled over the treatment period (i.e. migraine days with acute medication use on the 
total of migraine days), showed that at baseline, the proportions of MHDs with any acute medication use 
out of all MHDs were comparable among treatment groups in all pivotal studies (ranging from 76% to 
83%), with the 75% to ≤100% subcategory having the highest percentages of patients at each timepoint 
(including baseline, each monthly interval and overall at the end of the DB period of both EM and CM 
studies). As per the two twin studies in EM, in study CGAG the mean reduction in the proportion of MHDs 
with acute medication use resulted statistically different for the LY-240mg group only, overall at the end 
of DB period (p=.029), a significant difference was also seen at month 2 (p=.002). In study CGAH the 
difference was statistically significant for both doses with respect to placebo (p≤.001). As per the change 
from baseline in the proportion of MHDs with triptan use, the difference vs placebo was significant for both 
galcanezumab doses in both EM studies (p≤.001). The absence of significant differences in the proportion 
of MHDs with acetaminophen/paracetamol use is not surprising, considering the increased shift from 
baseline towards the use of this medicine that was generally observed in all three pivotal studies for all 
treatment groups. 
Although the vast majority of secondary endpoints were met with high statistical significance (p<0.001), 
overall, the treatment effect tends to be smaller, partially due to the smaller baseline number. Of note, 
the differences with placebo in changes in monthly moderate to severe MHDs were: 1.35 and 1.36 for the 
120 mg and 240 mg galcanezumab doses. When the severity of remaining migraine days is taken into 
consideration, no difference with placebo is observed. The analysis of changes from baseline in MHDs 
according to the ICHD definition (with the exclusion of probable migraine days) substantially confirmed 
consistency of treatment effect independently of the definition of the primary endpoint, albeit with a lower 
gain over placebo (-1.53 and -1.56 for the low and high galcanezumab doses). When stricter definition of 
MHD including any day with acute medication use is applied (triptans, NSAIDS or paracetamol), the gain 
over placebo appears to fluctuate according to the type of acute medication used, reaching the minimum 
difference with paracetamol (-1.15 with the galcanezumab lower dose and -1.04 with the higher dose).

Study CGAH 
The patient population recruited in this study was similar to that of the CGAG study. Similarly to study 
CGAG, also in study CGAH, the primary endpoint was met with high significance at both galcanezumab 
doses with comparable magnitude of effect between studies. The treatment effect for secondary 
endpoints was also similar to the one reported in the CGAG. Both doses of galcanezumab were equally 
effective.  
Study CGAI 
The discontinuation rate from the DB treatment phase due to any reason was 8.8%, 5.4% and 3.9% in 
the placebo, galcanezumab 120-mg and galcanezumab 240-mg treatment groups. No patients 
discontinued study due to lack of efficacy in both galcanezumab treatment groups, whereas 4 patients out 
of 558 discontinuations due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group during the DB phase of the study. 
Overall 98.5% (n=1021) of patients who completed the DB treatment phase entered the optional OL 
treatment phase. At the cut-off date for the study report, the large majority of patients (79.4%) were still 
ongoing, and 125 patients (12.2%) discontinued early due to any reason. The rates of discontinuation 
from OL treatment due to adverse events were overall small (3.0%). Adverse event was the main reason 
to discontinue from OL treatment phase (3.0% overall). 
Sex, age, race, and BMI were generally similar across treatment groups at baseline. Patients were 
predominantly female with mean age around 40 years, as expected on the basis of epidemiological data 
for the pathology. On average, MHDs per month were 19.4, most of which included acute headache 
medication use. The average number of migraine attacks per month was 6.3. Migraine severity was rated 
as moderate. The majority of patients (77.8%) had prior migraine preventive treatment, with 29.5% 
having failed 2 or more such treatments due to lack of efficacy in the past 5 years. More than 60% of 
patients met the criteria for medication overuse. The gain over placebo and the statistical soundness of 
the differences obtained in patients with medication overuse for both galcanezumab doses seem larger 
compared to what obtained in patients without medication overuse at baseline: 1.44 MHD for 120 mg 
dose in (p=0.037) and 1.30 MHD for 240 mg dose (p=0.056) (mean changes: -3.49 for placebo, -4.93 for 
120 mg dose and -4.78 for 240 mg dose). The Applicant explained that the different response to 
galcanezumab treatment compared to placebo in patients with medication overuse headache at baseline 
and patients without medication overuse headache at baseline was mostly driven by the different placebo 
response in these two patients’ groups.  
Overall, treatment groups were balanced with respect to baseline disease characteristics. Both 
galcanezumab doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo for the primary endpoint. Overall 
LSMean mean reduction from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs during the DB treatment phase 
was 4.8 days and 4.6 days for galcanezumab 120-mg and galcanezumab 240-mg, respectively, 
compared with 2.7 days for placebo (LSMean change difference from placebo: -2.1 and -1.9; p<.001 for 
each dose group versus placebo). The magnitude of the effect appears limited, although a sound 
evaluation of its clinical relevance needs direct comparison with available treatments that is at present 
lacking. Although a reliable comparison with historical data from topiramate and Botox published studies 
is hampered by the diversity of study designs and endpoints, the treatment effect of Emgality shows 
similarities with those results. 
All the sensitivity analyses performed were consistent with the primary analysis results.  In all pivotal 
studies unusually high rates of subjects with at least one important protocol deviation in the baseline and 
DB treatment phase were observed (n=150 for study CGAG [17.5%], n=191 [21%] for study CGAH and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 96/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
n=203 [18.2%].  The applicant provided 3 sets of data to verify if the results were influenced by specific 
deviations: i. the first set excluded patients with dosing intervals outside the specified limit (defined as 
intervals <21 or >37 days); ii. the second set excluded patients who used excluded concomitant 
medications (defined as taking prohibited migraine preventive medication for primary indication for >7 
consecutive days, taking prohibited medication for any indication for >7 consecutive days, 
opioid/barbiturate use for >7 consecutive days, or use of botulinum toxin A and B for any indication, 
during Study Periods II or III).  iii. the third set of analyses were per-protocol analyses that excluded all 
patients with any important protocol deviation. The results showed highly statistically significant 
differences in the overall LS Mean change from baseline of both galcanezumab doses vs placebo (p<.001 
in all three studies). In some instances, however, the difference vs placebo resulted even somewhat 
higher than what observed in the ITT population (for example, in the first set, for study CGAG the mean 
difference (±SE) vs placebo was -2.10±0.29 days in the LY-120mg group compared to -1.92±0.28 in the 
ITT population and for study CGAI the mean difference (±SE) vs placebo was -2.19±0.44 days in the 
LY-120mg whereas it was -2.09±0.42 in the ITT population. The statistically significant differences were 
preserved also in the third set which was much more conservative by definition.  
Only 14.6% of patients continued a stable dose of either topiramate or propranolol for concurrent 
migraine prophylaxis during the study. The additional treatment benefit of galcanezumab in patients with 
CM on treatment with either topiramate or propranolol seems relatively small, i.e. 1-day gain. Although 
no significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed, the applicant discussed the benefit of 
galcanezumab treatment in add on to topiramate and propanol in CM patients as comparable to what 
observed from studies with fremanezumab, arguing that in add on setting the response to treatment 
might be less pronounced compared to monotherapy setting, while being more variable in individual 
patients. The proposed individualized approach, along with the initiations and evaluation of the treatment 
effect to be performed only by experienced physicians is endorsed. 
For the 240-mg dose group, all key secondary objectives of the study were met after multiplicity 
adjustment except for 100% response rate.  
For the 120-mg dose group, only the key secondary objective of ≥ 50% response rate remained 
statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment. Thus, all remaining items in the 120-mg testing 
sequence (MHD with acute medication use, MSQ Role Function-Restrictive, PGI-S, and 100% response 
rate) are considered not statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment regardless of p-value.   
The estimated proportions of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in MHDs, were 15.4% (1.6), 
27.6% (2.7) and 27.5% (2.6) for placebo galcanezumab 120 mg dose and galcanezumab 240 mg dose, 
respectively, with gains over placebo of 12%. The NNT to obtain a 50% reduction of monthly MHDs, was 
8.2 (5.4,16) and 8.27 (5.5,16) for the low and high galcanezumab dose, respectively. About 50% of 
patients who were >50% responders maintained response to treatment for all 3 months of the DB period; 
when calculated as proportions of the ITT population these rates were 16.9% and 14.6% for patients on 
120-mg and 240-mg galcanezumab, respectively, and 6.3% for placebo (p<.001). Again, the magnitude 
of treatment effect appears limited.  
The threshold of >75% response was met by roughly 9% of patients treated with the high galcanezumab 
dose, albeit with a reduced gain over placebo of 4.3%. Although not statistically significant after 
multiplicity adjustment, a similar proportion (7%) of patients treated with the 120 mg dose met the 
>75% threshold. The NNT to obtain 75% reduction of monthly MHDs was, as expected, very high:  39.5 
and 23.4 for the low and high galcanezumab doses, respectively.  
Although the vast majority of secondary endpoints were met with high statistical significance (p<0.001), 
overall. Of note, the differences with placebo in changes in monthly moderate to severe MHDs were: 1.98 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 97/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 1.72 for the 120 mg and 240 mg galcanezumab doses. When the severity of remaining migraine days 
is taken into consideration, the difference with placebo, albeit statistical significant was very low: 0.007 
and of difficult interpretation in terms of clinical significance. The analysis of changes from baseline in 
MHDs according to the ICHD definition (with the exclusion of probable migraine days) substantially 
confirmed consistency of treatment effect independently of the definition of the primary endpoint. The 
gain over placebo in reduction of MHDs, similarly to what observed in the EM studies, fluctuated according 
to the type of acute medication used.  
The overall difference vs placebo of the mean reduction in the proportion of MHDs with acute medication 
use at the end of the 3-month DB period resulted statistically different for both doses in study CGAI 
(p<.001). As per the change from baseline in the proportion of MHDs with triptan use, the difference vs 
placebo was significant for both galcanezumab doses in CGAI study (p=.003 and .007 for the LY-120mg 
and LY-240mg dose groups, respectively). As observed above regarding the studies on episodic migraine, 
the absence of significant differences in the proportion of MHDs with acetaminophen/paracetamol use is 
not surprising, considering the increased shift from baseline towards the use of this medicine that was 
generally observed in all three pivotal studies for all treatment groups. It should be noted, that since 
patients could take multiple acute medications on the same day, their use ended up highly 
heterogeneously distributed among studies and among treated groups, giving unpredictable outcomes 
from a strictly clinical perspective. However, although it can be reasonably stated that this reflects the 
clinical reality, it would have been more reassuring to notice a clearer reduced use of acute medications 
relative to MHD. 
In the OL phase of the study, all patients received equal doses in the first two timepoints (galcanezumab 
240-mg at Visit 7, Month 3, as two injections, followed by the 120-mg maintenance dose at Visit 8, Month 
4, as a single injection). This was done “to encourage use of the lower dose 120 mg”, which is reasonable, 
although in contrast to the statement of the applicant who deemed natural that the 240 mg was generally 
preferred over the lower dose especially for responders at the higher galcanezumab dose in the DB phase, 
at risk of experiencing a “nocebo” effect once realizing the dose decrease in the OL phase after the first 
240 mg dose. In fact, the physicians choose to shift the large majority of patients treated with the 120 mg 
dose to the 240 mg dose, during the OL phase, thus the maintenance of treatment effect for the 120 mg 
dose is not soundly assessable on the basis of the OL data. From the updated data provided up to month 
12 it was clear that it remains at the clinician’s discretion to opt for the most indicated dose according to 
the clinical need for each patient, with 120 mg being the default dose recommendation, after an initial 240 
mg loading dose. Evidence of differences in response to treatment between the two galcanezumab dose 
is also derived from subgroup analyses.  
Subgroup analyses 
A statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction suggested better results for patients without 
aura in both EM (Episodic Integrated Analysis Set) and CM studies. In addition, in the CM study CGAI, 
there was a statistically significant dose interaction suggesting that the 240 mg dose performed better in 
patients with aura, and the 120 mg did better in patients without (p=.016). However, when data were 
re-analysed after 12 months, both doses (120 mg and 240 mg) seem comparable in the subgroups of 
patients with aura vs without aura, failure of previous treatment or North America region vs Europe and 
Other regions. It is agreed that both – 120mg and 240mg - doses seem to have comparable efficacy and 
no obvious benefit in any of tested subgroups could be firmly established for the higher dose vs lower 
dose. 
In both EM and CM study, both doses of galcanezumab were associated with statistically significantly 
higher reductions in mean MHD than placebo independently on prophylactic treatment failure (yes/no or 
>1 or >2), with the exception of patients who had not failed at least 1 treatment and received 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 98/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
galcanezumab 120 mg in Study CGAI, for whom difference from placebo was not statistically significant. 
There was also a statistically significant dose interaction in the CM study, such that the 120 mg dose 
performed better in patients who had failed at least 1 or at least 2 prophylactic treatment whereas the 
high dose did better in those patients who had not failed at least 1 or at least 2 prophylactic treatment 
(p<.001). The reason for this differential performance of the 2 galcanezumab doses in CM is not 
immediately explicable. It appears that placebo response was highest in North America (-4.39 – CGAI and 
-3.29 CGAH study) compared to Europe (-2.23 – CGAI and -1.26 CGAH) and Other regions (-1.98 – CGAI 
and -2.64 CGAH study).  
Patients older than 65 years were not studied and efficacy in this group is not determined. The analyses 
of efficacy by age groups, e.g. in patients aged 18-40, 40-50, 50-55 and >55, requested to understand 
whether galcanezumab treatment in different age groups was equally effective and could be extrapolated 
to patients older than 65 years, demonstrated that up to that age no clear effect on galcanezumab 
efficacy could be envisaged, and numerically greater changes from baseline in MHDs were generally 
observed for older patients compared to younger subjects, without significant treatment-by-group 
interactions, except for the EM studies in which older subjects showed larger reductions from baseline in 
MHDs with acute medication use. Results of a subgroup analysis of primary outcome measure seem to 
indicate that the effect of galcanezumab occurs irrespectively of the baseline number of MHDs (<8 vs ≥8 
in EM and <19 vs ≥19 in CM) also in patients aged ≥ 50 years. Therefore, the treatment effect of 
galcanezumab can be extrapolated to older patients (≥65 years). However, since the population of 
patients recruited to the pivotal studies was restricted to patients with 4 or more monthly MHD, the 
indication of galcanezumab for the prophylaxis of migraine is maintained for adults who have at least 4 
migraine days per month. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the submitted data supports authorisation of galcanezumab in the prophylaxis 
of migraine. The indication has been modified to reflect the fact that the benefits are expected in patients 
who have at least 4 migraine days per month.  
2.7.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 3156 patients were exposed to galcanezumab at any dose across the entire galcanezumab 
development program. At the dose range of 120 to 240 mg, 1647 patients were exposed to galcanezumab 
for ≥6 months (≥6 monthly doses), and 279 patients were exposed to galcanezumab for 1 year (12 
monthly doses). A safety update included a total of 526 patients exposed to 12 monthly doses of 
galcanezumab and 1920 patients were exposed to galcanezumab for ≥6 months (≥6 monthly doses). 
Adverse events 
Injection site pain was the most common AE and was seen in 10.07% and 11.64% of GMB treated 
patients (120 mg and 240 mg respectively) and in 9.51% of placebo treated patients. Considering this 
small difference between GMB and placebo, the active compound itself does not seem to add much pain 
as opposed to other injection site reactions, eg erythema and pruritus. Injection site pain was considered 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 99/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an ADR. Injection site pain was considered as severe in 9.6% of patients experiencing this AE; this should 
be reflected in the SmPC.  
Injection site reaction (an unspecific term for all types of injection site reactions), injection site erythema, 
injection site pruritus and constipation were significantly more common in GMB treated patients than in 
placebo. The clinical phase 2/3 trials are not powered to find statistically significant differences for AEs, 
but dose response patterns were present for these four AEs, in particular injection site reaction. The 
injection site reactions may be due to immunogenicity and constipation has other biological plausibility. 
All of these were considered as ADR.  
Time course analysis for common TEAEs 
Injection site pain, injection site reaction, injection site erythema and injection site pruritus primarily 
occurred on the day of injection, but there was not a specific injection (for example, second dose, third 
dose, etc.) where it was most frequently observed. Most events were mild to moderate in severity and 
generally resolved  on the same day. Constipation did not have a pattern of occurrence with regard to 
timing of injection. It was moderate in severity. Some patients reported persistent constipation (resolved 
in >30 days).  
The frequencies of common TEAEs for the safety update were similar compared to the initial submission 
for the galcanezumab pooled dose group except for nasopharyngitis and viral upper respiratory tract 
infection that were due to the differences in mapping (MedDRA v 19.1 vs. 20.0) between the initial 
submission and safety update.

Uncommon important AEs 
The event pruritus was reported in 0.28% in the placebo arm and 0.71% and 1.23% in the low and high 
GMB arm respectively. The difference was statistically significant for the high GMB group and placebo, as 
well as for the GMB pooled group and placebo. Vertigo was reported more frequently in the GMB_Pooled 
(n=14, 0.98%) and GMB 240 mg dose group (n=9, 1.23%) than in the placebo-treated group (n=3, 
0.21%). Pruritus and vertigo show a dose response pattern. For both these AEs there is biological 
plausibility; pruritus  belongs to the hypersensitivity reactions and for vertigo there is an association 
between the inhibition of CGRP and interference with vestibular function. Thus pruritus and vertigo were 
considered as ADRs. Overall among all galcanezumab-treated patients (Analysis Set E, all Galcanezumab 
exposure data set) 4/2586 events (0.15%) within HLT Hearing Losses ( deafness unilateral/ sudden 
hearing loss/ hypoacusis) occurred during GMB 240 mg treatment, compared to no such event out of 
1698 placebo treated patients. For two patients there were well-described confounders, such as ear 
infections or cerumen impaction. None of the events coded as hearing loss were SAE and no patient 
discontinued treatment due to a hearing loss event.   
The Applicant identified 10 MedDRA high level terms (HLT) potentially correlated to ulcer healing. In the 
placebo controlled Analysis Set A, the incidence of patients reporting these events in galcanezumab 
treated patients (n=6; 0.4%; EIAR 1.12 PY; PTs: gastric ulcer 3, aphtous ulcer 2, skin ulcer 1) was similar 
to placebo (n=4; 0.3%; EIAR 0.75/ 100 PY. PTs: aphtous ulcer 1, peptic ulcer 2, stomatitis 1). In Analysis 
Set E (all GMB exposures) a total of 12 cases were identified (GMB treated time 0.5%; EIAR 0.81/ 100 
PY). None of these events were serious.  
The Applicant also conducted a search for events of wound by searching “wound” in all MedDRA PTs, 
lower-level terms, and reported terms, plus any PT in the HLT of Healing Abnormal NEC.  In the 
placebo-controlled Analysis Set A, the incidence of patients reporting these events in 
galcanezumab-treated patients (n=4; 0.3%; EAIR 0.75/100 PY) was similar to placebo (n=3; 0.2%; EAIR 
0.56/100 PY).  In Analysis Set E (all galcanezumab exposures), a total of 6 wound-related cases were 
identified (GMB-treated time 0.2%; EAIR 0.40/100 PY). There was only one case reported as impaired 
healing. Nineteen days after the 5th monthly dose, the patient reported mild impaired healing (“slow 
wound healing”) which resolved in 10 days.  The patient said he noticed an ant bite or cut which appeared 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 101/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be healing slower than bites or cuts received prior to investigational drug being taken. The investigator 
considered the event related to study drug.  The patient continued treatment and completed the study. 
The event was confounded by concomitant use of corticosteroids which are known to impair healing.    
Common AEs in analysis E of special interest 
Of the additional AE occurring in ≥2% after rounding in analysis in the all Galcanezumab exposure data 
set but in the galcanezuamb placebo contolled data set, rash may be dose dependent Incidence 
proportions were 0.74%, 1.92%, 1.95% and 3.45% in dose groups <120mg, 120mg, 240mg and 300mg 
respectively. Exposure time was shorter for the lowest and the highest dose groups (3 months). This 
result may originate from imbalances in dose groups and exposure times. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by Maximum Severity 
Primary Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set A 
Among patients who reported TEAEs in Analysis Set A, severe TEAEs occurred in  6.9%, 6.7% and 6.6% 
in patients treated with GMB 120 mg, 240 mg and PBO, respectively; moderate TEAEs occurred in 31%, 
28% and 27% of patients treated with GMB 120 mg, 240 mg and PBO, respectively. 
Within the severe events for each of the galcanezumab dose groups, approximately one-third were TEAEs 
related to injection sites. The percentage of patients that reported injection site pain as severe was similar 
across both galcanezumab dose groups and placebo.  However, there were more patients in the 
galcanezumab 240-mg dose group that reported a severe event of injection site reaction, injection site 
erythema, and injection site pruritus than either the galcanezumab 120-mg dose group or placebo. 
Two events of gastric ulcer of moderate intensity occurred out of 730 patients treated with GMB 240 mg 
(0.3%), and one event of mild intensity occurred out of 705 patients treated with GMB 120 mg (0.1%), 
compared to no such events of any intensity out of 1451 patients treated with PBO. These two events of 
gastric ulcers were not considered drug related by the investigators. Combining the terms Gastric ulcer 
and Peptic ulcer, the following frequencies were observed:  GMB 120 mg 1 patient 0.14%; GMB 240 mg 
2 patients 0.27%; GMB Pooled 3 patients, 0.21%; PBO 2 patients 0.14%. 
Two TEAEs of acute pancreatitis occurred in patients treated with GMB (0.14%) (one event of severe 
intensity in a patient treated with GMB 240 mg and one event of  moderate intensity in a patients treated 
with GMB 120 mg, compared to no such event in PBO treated patients (see SAE section). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Evaluation of Cardiovascular Safety 
There were two main reasons why cardiovascular safety was an important safety topic of interest in 
migraine patients. First, CGRP is a potent vasodilator thought to play a protective role in cardiovascular 
health and second, migraine patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
Epidemiological studies have shown that for myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic 
stroke and angina, the incidence rate is approximately 1 per 1000 patient-years in migraine patients with 
somewhat higher incidence rates in men than women. New onset ischaemic heart disease has a higher 
incidence rate of approximately 4 per 1000 person-years. In safety analysis set A, total patients years 
were 533 for placebo and 536 for the pooled GMB exposed patients. To evaluate specific CV events in 
cardiovascular safety, even a longer follow up period to gain more patient-years may be needed. At 
present, pooled long term data can be informative.  
Patients at high risk of cardiovascular events were excluded from the phase 3 clinical trials (exclusion 
criteria: recent acute cardiovascular events and/or serious cardiovascular risk within 6 months before 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 102/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enrolment; in studies CGAH and CGAI: patients with lifetime history of stroke were excluded).  Mean age 
of patients enrolled in Phase 3 studies was  41 years.  
Despite these exclusion criteria, the Applicant tried to identify within the Phase 3 trial patient population 
patients having baseline cardiovascular disease risk if they had, at baseline, 1 or more defined conditions 
that were part of the patients’ medical history or pre-existing conditions in the following SMQs: Ischaemic 
heart disease (Myocardial infarction (subSMQ, narrow terms only; Other ischaemic heart disease 
(subSMQ narrow terms only); Hypertension (SMQ narrow terms only); Cardiac failure (SMQ narrow terms 
only); Cardiomyopathy (SMQ narrow terms only); Ischaemic CNS vascular conditions (subSMQ under 
CNS vascular disorders, all terms are Narrow); Dyslipidaemia (SMQ, all terms are Narrow); 
Hyperglycaemia / new onset diabetes mellitus (SMQ, narrow terms only).  
Approximately 17% to 19% of patients in the Phase 3 clinical trials had pre-existing cardiac risk factors 
such as: hypertension (GMB Pooled 8% vs PBO 7%), hypercholesterolemia (2.4% vs 4.3%), 
hyperlipidaemia (3% in both groups), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (1.4% vs 1.2%), dyslipidaemia (1.4% vs 
0.8%). No patient reported a pre-existing condition or medical history of variant or microvascular angina 
at baseline. 
Framingham risk score (FRS) is a gender-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular 
risk of an individual. Cardiovascular risk factors such as age, gender, smoking, systolic blood pressure 
and cholesterol are included. FRS scores were obtained for study subjects to further evaluate their CV 
risk. As expected the mean and median FRS were higher in patients with CV risk at baseline compared to 
those without risk.  
Of female patients, 21%, 20% and 18% (placebo, GMB 120 mg and GMB 240 mg respectively) were 
classified as having baseline CV risk according to the Applicant’s classification. In female patients, the 
mean and median FRS calculated CV risks were small, ≤ 1% per 10 years, regardless of CV risk class 
“yes” or “no”. Comparing the 3rd quartile and the maximum risk shows that there may be female patients 
with somewhat higher CV risk in the “yes” group compared to the “no” group.  
In male patients, 26%, 29% and 27% (placebo, GMB 120 mg and GMB 240 mg respectively) were 
classified as having baseline CV risk according to the applicant.  The 10 years risk of CV disease based on 
FRS scores was similar in GMB and placebo treated patients. According to FRS classification, male patients 
in the upper quartile in the “yes” group have a moderate to high 10 year risk for CV disease and male 
study patients clearly had a higher baseline CV risk compared to female study subjects.  
Migraine is more common in women than in men, and in young and middle aged people than in the 
elderly. This is reflected correctly in the study population. Patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients at risk 
for acute and/or serious cardiovascular risk were excluded from the trials. Consequently, the study 
population consisting of mainly middle aged women, in general a low risk population is not expected to 
provide much information about the impact of GMB in cardiovascular disease. Migraine, especially with a 
severity motivating prophylaxis, is uncommon in patients older than 65 years. The main concern for this 
age group is the generally increased cardiovascular risk and disease. Thus, it is more important to gain 
information about the interaction between GMB and CV disease than GMB and age > 65 years. Male 
migraine patients may be of special interest and young women with migraine aura. 
In Analysis Set A, TEAEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC occurred with a similar frequency in GMB Pooled 
group (11/1435, 0.8%) and PBO group (11/1451, 0.8%). Most events  in the GMB treated group occurred 
in the GMB 240 mg group (9/11), with a statistically significant higher frequency in the GMB 240 mg 
group compared to the GMB 120 mg (1.23% vs 0.28%).

In order to identify TEAEs Likely cardiovascular in nature, the applicant used 9 MedDRA SMQs (specifically 
broad and narrow terms) and the list of events was then medically reviewed to determine if the terms 
identified represented likely cardiovascular events. The number of patients with at least 1 TEAE likely 
cardiovascular in nature (broad and narrow terms) were the following: PBO 42/1451 (2.89%), GMB 120 
mg 18/705 (2.55%), GMB 240 mg 24/ 730 (3.29%), GMB Pooled 42/ 1435 (2.93%). No clinically relevant  
or statistically significant difference in the frequencies of TEAEs likely cardiovascular in nature was 
observed between placebo and any galcanezumab group or between the galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 
mg dose groups.

For the nine standardised MedDRA queries analysed, there was one significant difference between GMB 
treated patients and placebo. With the incidence rates calculated for CV events based on epidemiological 
studies, statistically significant results are not necessarily expected with this number of patients and 
exposure time.    
For the SMQ Pulmonary hypertension there was a significant difference between GMB treated patients 
and placebo when looking at broad and narrow scope preferred terms. Two of the three cases contributing 
to this result, were found unlikely to have pulmonary hypertension. 
 
For the Embolic and thrombotic events SMQ, four patients in the 240 mg GMB group and four 
placebo patients had treatment emergent CV AEs,  (OR 1.99) were captured. Three of these 
events were SAE. For the GMB treated patients, FRS corresponded to a 10 year risk for CV disease 
of ≤1% and all belonged to the CV risk group “no”. Two of the placebo patients had clear CV risk 
factors whereas all 4 events in the GMB-treated patients occurred unexpectedly in patients 
without CV risk factors.  
Ischemic heart disease SMQ found 1 placebo patient with myocardial infarction and one 240 mg GMB 
patient also with myocardial infarction. These have already been described above in the thrombotic 
section. Two other GMB treated patients were captured by the Ischemic heart disease SMQ.  
The other two TEAE in the SMQ ischemic heart disease that occurred in galcanezumab treated patients 
were:  TEAE of ECG signs of ischemia (galcanezumab 120 mg to galcanezumab 240 mg), in a 49-year-old 
male, who smoked and had a pre-existing ECG ischemic finding at screening; and TEAE of ECG T wave 
abnormal (galcanezumab 120 mg), in a 55-year old female, without cardiovascular risk factors, which 
occurred on the same day of starting treatment with galcanezumab.   
The table below shows severe CV AE in Analysis set A. All cases have been discussed above in the 
thromboembolic AE section. 
Table 16 - Severe cardiovascular events in analysis set A 
- 
In addition to the SAEs noted for Analysis Set A, 4 SAEs were reported by 3 galcanezumab- 
treated patients in Analysis Set E: acute myocardial infarction and angina unstable in a patient 
with cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac failure congestive, in a patient with a final diagnosis of 
congenital cardiomyopathy, ruptured cerebral aneurysm in a patient with a final diagnosis of 
mycotic aneurysm and popliteal artery occlusion leading to knee amputation in a patient with 
multiple cardiovascular risk factors,including diabetes. Furthermore, a healthy subject in a phase 
2 study experienced a SAE of atrial fibrillation, moderate in severity, 69 days after receiving a 
single dose of 300 mg lyophilized galcanezumab. The event was judged by the investigator to be 
possibly related to study treatment as no alternative causes were identified. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 106/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients reporting cardiovascular events did not vary based on the presence or absence 
of “cardiovascular risk” (as defined above) in the GMB 120 and 240 mg group.   
Looking at CV AEs in patients with treatment emergent changes in blood pressure, pulse, quantitative and 
qualitative changes in ECG, this mostly didn’t show any differences of interest between placebo and GMB 
treated patients. Of patients with TE quantitative changes in ECG, two patients in the placebo group 
(2.56%) and two patients in the GMB 240 mg group (5.26%) had TE cardiac arrhythmias. For pooled GMB 
patients, there is no difference in incidence compared to placebo and with this few cases no conclusions 
can be drawn. However the time period is short and the CV effect of example given hypertension, if not 
severe hypertension, may appear in a longer time span than 6 months.  
Eight galcanezumab treated patients and 4 PBO treated patients reported a pre-existing condition or 
medical history of Raynaud’s phenomenon. All patients, except 1, were females.  One patient reported 
worsening of Raynaud’s after the second dose (galcanezumab 150 mg/2 weeks), which resolved in 5 
days.  The study investigator considered the event related to treatment.  The patient completed 
treatment (6 total doses) and the study with no reoccurrence.  The limited available data do not allow to 
draw conclusions on galcanezumab’s role in triggering a reoccurrence or worsening of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon.  
Cardiovascular findings in analysis set E (All Galcanezumab treated patients) and the long term studies 
CGAI and CGAJ   
Severe AE, cardiovascular in nature in analysis set E not described in set A are discussed above. Among 
patients with categorical changes of interest in blood pressure, pulse, quantitative or qualitative changes 
in ECG, the proportion of patients in the galcanezumab pooled group reporting cardiovascular TEAEs was 
similar in set E to the proportions observed in Analysis Set A.  The long-term safety of galcanezumab, 
including cardiovascular safety will be further followed in the planned Category 3 pharmacovigilance 
study. 
Table 17 -  Increase in cardiovascular medications in long term study CGAJ 
In long term study CGAJ, the frequency of patients (GMB 120 mg and 240 mg pooled)  with baseline CV 
risk (”yes “group ) had a higher incidence of  increase or a new start of CV medications compared to 
analysis set A. For study CGAJ incidence proportions were as follows: anti-hypertensives 12.0%, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 107/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anti-thrombotics 10.0 and anti-arrhythmics: 4.0%. The corresponding numbers for analysis set A were 
4.1%, 1.2%, and 0.0%, respectively. The higher incidence proportions of CV medications for study CGAJ 
could partly be due to longer study duration, but the incidence proportions are about 3-8 times higher and 
the study duration about the double.  
The greater proportion of patients with higher GMB doses needing anti-hypertensives in analysis set E and 
study CGAJ, is consistent with the increased proportions of patients meeting TE categories or levels for 
high blood pressure in the higher doses. 
 The Applicant provided exposure-adjusted analyses using time-at-risk-adjusted incidence rate (per 100 
patient-years) for use of CV medications. The EAIRs for the 300 mg dose are numerically more 
unfavourable compared to the other dose groups for a range of events, including treatment-emergent 
systolic blood pressure, use of concomitant antihypertensives (increase in dose or start of new 
medication), rash of potential or likely hypersensitivity in nature, and treatment-emergent abnormally 
high hepatic enzyme values (ALP, ALAT, ASAT).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 108/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The EAIRs for the CV concomitant medications were higher for the galcanezumab 240 mg dose group 
compared to galcanezumab 120 mg for all 4 medication classes for the ‘All Patients’ group and CV Disease 
Risk Group-Yes.  
Blood pressure 
In patients experiencing categorical changes of interest in blood pressure and pulse, the proportion of 
patients reporting TEAEs cardiovascular in nature in galcanezumab treated patients was equal or lower to 
the ones observed in PBO treated patients, apart from one serious event of TIA (classified both in the CNS 
vascular disorder SOC and in the thrombotic and embolic SOC) experienced by 1/177 (0.56%) of GMB 
treated patients compared to 0 events among the 165 placebo treated patients; and one event in the SOC 
pulmonary hypertension (Patients with at least one narrow or broad scope PT) experienced by 1/177 
(0.56%) of GMB treated patients with Categorical Changes of Interest in Blood Pressure and Pulse 
compared to 0 events among the 165 placebo treated patients with Categorical Changes of Interest in 
Blood Pressure and Pulse.   
Adverse Events related to injection sites 
As discussed in the section about common adverse events, Injection site pain, injection site reaction (not 
further specified), injection site erythema and injection site pruritus were considered ADR. They mostly 
occur on the day of injection.  
MAA includes GMB administration via prefilled syringe or prefilled pen (autoinjector). A randomized 
comparison of AEs in patients utilizing different injection devices shows that 12.5% of patients using the 
autoinjector experienced  injection site pain versus 2.5% of patients using the syringe in the clinical 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 109/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacology study CGAQ in which healthy subject received 240 mg (2 doses) of galcanezumab either in 
pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen one time.  In the pivotal placebo controlled trial the prefilled syringe 
was used. During the long term study CGAJ, the prefilled pen (autoinjector) became available. Thus 
safety data are to a majority based on the device causing less pain.  Based on the company’s analysis for 
the limited group of patients who used both a prefilled syringe and an autoinjector at least 1 time (n= 
179), one could conclude that injection site events tended to occur more frequently with the autoinjector.  
Immunogenicity 
“Injection site reactions”, a composite term for all types of injection site reactions, were AEs statistically 
more common in ADA+ patients (11.1%) than in ADA negative patients (5.9%).  “Injection site 
inflammation,” was reported in 1.5% of treatment-emergent ADA+ patients compared to 0.1% of 
patients without treatment-emergent ADA (p-value<.001). The majority of those patients had the last 
“injection site reaction” event reported before the detection of TE ADA, after which no such AEs occurred.  
Hypersensitivity events 
In analysis set A, hypersensitivity reactions, both immediate and non-immediate, were significantly more 
common in GMB patients (0.98%, 3.83%) than in placebo (0.34%, 2.31%). Injection site reactions were 
the most common hypersensitivity AEs. One placebo treated patient and four GMB patients discontinued 
due to hypersensitivity reactions of which one was on the day of injection. There were no serious 
hypersensitivity reactions in placebo controlled studies. No case of immediate or non-immediate 
anaphylaxis was captured by the narrow PTs. 
Urticaria has been identified as an ADR by the applicant.  Overall, in the placebo-controlled studies of 
Analysis Set A, the incidence proportions for urticaria were 0.34% for placebo, 0.28% for galcanezumab 
120 mg and 0.14% for galcanezumab 240 mg, respectively. None of the cases were deemed serious or 
severe in intensity. Two serious, but non-immediate cases of urticaria were reported later on, one in an 
open label phase and one post treatment. Of these, one case can possibly be related to galcanezumab 
treatment. The second case may be related, but other drugs (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) might also 
have contributed to the reaction. There were no serious (other) hypersensitivity reactions in placebo 
controlled studies.

The tables above show proportions of patients with different hypersensitivity reactions in relation to TE 
ADA status. The first table shows GMB treatment phase and the second GMB treatment + post treatment 
phase. The incidence proportion of broad scope anaphylactic reactions is almost double in patients with TE 
ADA, a difference that is significant (p=0.019) when the post treatment phase is included. 
Hypersensitivity reactions don’t reach statistical significance, but there is a trend (p=0.059) when post 
treatment phases is added.  The applicant was requested to further assess a possible association between 
immunogenicity and TEAEs. A patient level examination of TEAEs of interest in patients with 
treatment-emergent ADA was conducted. Overall, this review did not demonstrate a clear temporal 
association between these AEs and the presence of treatment-emergent ADA.

Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) 
Preferred terms within the HLT of Upper respiratory tract infections were determined to be AEs of interest 
based on findings from the Phase 2 studies (ART-01 and CGAB), where a higher percentage of GMB 
treated patients presented Upper respiratory tract infection (PT) compared to PBO treated patients 
(Study ART-01, GMB 150 mg 24.3% vs PBO 10.9%; Study CGAB, GMB 120-mg 11.4% vs PBO 8.8%; 
GMB 300 mg 6.0%).  
In analysis set A, the incidence of URTIs was comparable between the galcanezumab 120-mg dose group 
(15.3%), the galcanezumab 240 mg dose group (13.0%) and placebo (12.8%). Among the patients who 
reported treatment-emergent URTIs, the majority reported events of mild to moderate severity. Most 
cases resolved within a few days, but in some cases the events had a long duration. 
Acute sinusitis occurred significantly more often in GMB treated patients (4/1435) than in placebo 
(0/1451), p=0.044. In analysis by SOC, pneumonia occurred significantly more in GMB treated patients 
(9/1435) than in placebo treated patients (2/1451) p=0.033 (GMB Pooled: 9/ 1435, 0.6%: 5 patients 
GMB 240, 4 patients GMB 120; PBO 2/1451 0.14%). In the investigator’s opinion all of these events 
except one were not related to study drug. None of the cases of pneumonia resulted in discontinuation of 
treatment or were reported as SAEs.  There was no apparent pattern in time to onset of the events, with 
the cases resolving, and all of the patients completed the treatment phases of the respective studies. 
In Analysis Set E, exposure-adjusted incidence rates of URTI TEAEs (by event PTs) in Analysis Set A were 
comparable to Analysis Set E.  The comparison with EAIRs in Study CGAI Galcanezumab-Treated Time 
and Long-Term Safety Study CGAJ did not suggest an association between increased URTIs and 
treatment duration. In Long-Term Safety Study CGAJ, the EAIR for sinusitis and pharyngitis was higher, 
but this was not consistent with Study CGAI Galcanezumab-Treated Time, which also includes patients 
treated up to 1 year. However in study CGAI, the EIAR for upper respiratory tract infection was higher 
than in Analysis Set A.  
Hepatic safety 
Hepatic safety investigated by MEDRA SMQ, showed TEAEs related to hepatic safety in less than 1% 
across treatment groups. A significant imbalance in the number of patients in the 240-mg dose group 
(n=6, 0.8%) as compared to placebo (n=3, 0.2%) reported a narrow scope PT for the Liver related 
investigations, signs and symptoms, p-value = 0.034. The Applicant provided an updated analysis due to 
the following revisions: an ascites event in one patient in the 240 mg group was removed in the updated 
analysis because the event was  reported as due to pancreatitis and thus not an hepatic event; an 
additional event was included in the placebo group because the event reported (liver function test 
increased) changed from a broad scope search term to a narrow scope search term due to a change in the 
MedDRA version. Results of the updated analysis  no longer show a statistically significant difference 
between these 2 treatment groups in frequency of TEAEs in the narrow scope SMQ “Liver related 
investigations, signs and symptoms.”   
Contradictory results were obtained for liver analytes, please see tables below, some data support 
increases ALT and AST with increased dose, i e consistent with the finding of increased liver 
investigations. However, no difference was seen between placebo and GMB in the randomized phases, 
nor from long term study CGAJ. 
The AEs of high ALP, ALT and AST are shown for three different analysis sets in the tables below.

Table 22 - The AEs of high ALP, ALT and AST in study CGAJ 
In analysis set E, the AEs of high ALP, ALT and AST show slightly increasing proportions of patients with 
increased GMB dose, or at least in the 300 mg dose when considering the shorter observation time for this 
dose.  Looking at study CGAI GMB treated time, there also seems to an increase of liver enzymes AE with 
increased GMB dose. However, more patients in the open label flex-dose phase were on the higher 240 
mg dose, hence more long term data comes from the higher 240 mg dose group which can confound the 
proportion. Study CGAJ, a fixed dose open label study does not show increased AEs of liver analytes in the 
higher dose (240 mg). This strengthens the thought that longer observation time is a confounding factor 
when comparing dose groups in study CGAI and needs further investigation. 
There was no SAE due to liver disease/injury. Two patients discontinued due to non-serious AEs. No 
patient met criteria for Hy’s law.

Serious Adverse Events Related to Hepatic Safety: Although no hepatic SAEs were identified by the 
SMQ searches, one patient ( [galcanezumab 240 mg]) had ascites and hepatic cysts as symptoms of the 
SAE of pancreatitis acute.  
Discontinuations due to Adverse Events Related to Hepatic Safety: Two patients discontinued due 
to AEs related to hepatic safety:  
1 patient receiving galcanezumab 240 mg discontinued study treatment due to the non- serious AE of 
hepatic enzyme increase of moderate severity which occurred 64 days after beginning double-blind 
treatment with galcanezumab 240 mg and following 2 administrations of galcanezumab at this dose.  
Hepatic lab values remained elevated throughout course of post-treatment phase (washout), eventually 
returning to normal range after patient had completed the trial.  The site investigator attributed the 
enzyme elevations to physical exertion playing sports. 
 1 patient receiving galcanezumab 240 mg discontinued study treatment due to non- serious AE of 
elevated liver enzyme of moderate severity which occurred 86 days after beginning double-blind 
treatment with galcanezumab 240 mg.  Hepatic lab values were measured within normal range at Visit 14 
of the post-treatment phase (washout), 106 days after hepatic enzyme elevation was noted.  
Concomitant medication included acetaminophen/paracetamol and naproxen. 
Integrated Analysis set E: 11 additional patients in Analysis set E reported ALT≥3×ULN and 
AST≥3×ULN and in 5 of these patients ALT and AST elevations were reported as TEAEs. Thus the overall 
frequency of patients in Analysis set E reporting ALT≥3×ULN and AST≥3×ULN (24/2392) was similar to 
Analysis set A. 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Hepatic Safety: In addition to the 10 
galcanezumab-treated patients who had a TEAE related to hepatic lab values discussed above, there were 
16 more galcanezumab- treated patients who had TEAEs related to hepatic lab values while on 
galcanezumab treatment.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 115/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An additional 4 patients reported TEAEs related to hepatic safety while not receiving galcanezumab 
treatment.  Three patients reported TEAEs related to hepatic safety during the Post-Treatment Phase 
(washout) and a fourth patient receiving placebo in Phase 2 Study ART-01 reported an additional TEAE 
related to hepatic safety. There were no SAEs related to hepatic laboratory values. 
Two further events of discontinuations due to AEs related to hepatic enzyme elevations occurred in the 
safety update period.  In one case no definite explanation for the events of ALT increased and AST 
increased was found although  the narrative reports that relevant medications taken prior to the event 
included ciprofloxacin and fluconazole, both for urinary tract infection. The second patient, discontinued 
the open-label treatment period due to the non-serious adverse event of hepatic enzyme increased (“
elevated liver enzymes”) of moderate severity. This was a previous placebo-treated patient with fatty 
liver infiltration who had elevated ALT and AST during the double-blind treatment period. ALT and AST 
continued to be elevated in the open-label treatment period. 
Evaluation of Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour and Non- Suicidal Self-Injurious Behaviour 
Patients with migraine headaches are at a greater risk for suicidality (Breslau et al. 2012); therefore, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour was assessed in all galcanezumab clinical trials using the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al. 2011).  
In Analysis set A, no imbalance was observed between GMB treated patients and PBO in the occurrence 
of Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and Non- 
Suicidal Self-Injurious Behaviour (one patient in the GMB 240 mg group had preparatory behaviour and 
active suicidal thoughts and one PBO treated patient had a SAE of attempted suicide;  two patient on PBO 
and one galcanezumab 240 mg treated patient  reported a self-injurious behaviour without suicidal intent 
during the double-blind treatment phase). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the migraine studies.  Two deaths were reported across the entire 
galcanezumab development program:  1 death was reported in a cluster headache study (CGAM, patient 
with a history of prostate and laryngeal cancer with diffuse metastasis. The patient received 3 doses of 
galcanezumab 300 mg during the double-blind treatment phase and 1 dose of open-label galcanezumab 
treatment prior to study discontinuation.  The patient died 17 days after study discontinuation.), and 1 
death was reported in a clinical pharmacology study (CGAQ, accidental drowning in a study subject who 
received a single dose of galcanezumab 240 mg, 15 days prior to the death). Both deaths were 
considered non drug related by investigators.  
Other SAEs 
Of SAEs, there were two cases of pancreatitis in the GMB groups compared with none in placebo. In one 
of them, the diagnosis is uncertain and in the other the pancreatitis was associated with gallstones. 
Another case of SAE with cholelithiasis is noted in the GMB 120 mg group. Among less common 
(non-severe) AEs, upper abdominal pain was significantly more common in GMB treated patients (pooled 
0.98%) than placebo (0.34%). CGRP has been stated to be a regulator of biliary flow (Rasmussen et al 
1997) and to be involved in sphincter Oddi (Sand et al).  In a more recently published clinical study, 
plasma levels of serotonin, calcitonin, and CGRP were followed in the course of acute pancreatitis in 60 
patients and compared to matching healthy volunteers (Wahlstrøm KL, et al. Scand J Gastroenterol. 
2017). CGRP levels in patients at admission did not differ from healthy volunteers, nor did CGRP change 
over time or show any relationship to severity, etiology or organ failure. However, stimulation of 
CHMP assessment report

endogenous release of CGRP was shown to improve pancreatic microcirculation and reduce inflammation 
in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats (Schneider L, et al. Pancreas. 2009).  An overview of exposure 
adjusted treatment-emergent incidence rates for the PTs of pancreatitis, alcoholic pancreatitis, and 
pancreatitis acute does not indicate an imbalance between GMB and placebo or an increased rate over 
time. Overall, based on the study data and literature references, it cannot be excluded that inhibition of 
CGRP could play a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and/or bile duct related disorders. However, the 
current data do not evoke a safety concern.A similar concern is put forward regarding urinary tract 
dysfunction. Among serious AEs in the GMB treated patients, there is one case of renal colic, one case of 
nephrolithiasis and one case of bladder dysfunction. Acute pyelonephritis was reported by more patients 
in the GMB 240-mg dose group (n=2, 0.27%) than in placebo (n=0, 0.00%). CGRP has been described to 
be an important ureter smooth muscle relaxant in guinea pig (Maggi et al) and other pre-clinical studies 
show CGRP actions in the bladder.  The applicant has provided a discussion of the potential effects of 
CGRP on the urinary tract and whether inhibition of CGRP could lead to urinary tract related adverse 
events. Overall, based on the current data, there appears to be limited evidence for this. In Analysis Set 
A were 3 patients in the galcanezumab pooled dose group (0.21%) and 1 patient in the placebo group 
(0.07%) who reported pyelonephritis or acute pyelonephritis. While indicates a small imbalance, none of 
the events in the galcanezumab-treated patients was considered related to treatment by study 
investigator, none led to discontinuation, and none re-occurred. In addition, 1 case of nephritis was 
reported in a placebo-treated patient and none in galcanezumab-treated patients. Estimates of EAIRs 
related to these disorders did not indicate an increase in incidence rates by dose or continued exposure. 
Nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently in placebo-treated patients (0.41%) than in 
galcanezumab-treated patients (0.21%). Of interest, as stated by the Applicant, patients with migraine 
have been reported to have increased risk for developing urinary calculi. One of several possible 
explanations might be an inhibitory effect of CGRP on the motility of the human ureter, which may 
promote ureteral obstruction due to urine stasis and urinary calculi (Tsai et al, 2015). A presentation of 
other TEAEs (bladder dysfunction, renal colic, and hypertonic bladder) showed similar frequencies 
between the groups.Three serious cases of malignant neoplasms (adenocarcinoma of the cervix, colon 
cancer, tubular breast carcinoma) and 1 serious case of benign tumour (rectal polyp) were reported in the 
galcanezumab 120-mg dose group. Similar events were not reported by patients on placebo. When all 
types of neoplasms were lumped together, benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps), neoplasms were more frequent among GMB exposed patients regardless of dose (0.71% and 
0.68%) compared to placebo (0.28%). Almost all events were single cases. The EAIR for the Neoplasm 
SOC in Analysis Set E was similar to that of Set A. The EAIR in Study CGAJ was numerically higher for the 
galcanezumab 240 mg dose group (EAIR 4.25) compared to the other data sets. However, confidence 
intervals were overlapping. In Analysis Set E, a total of 32 patients (1.24%) presented benign or 
malignant events during GMB-treated time and the post-treatment phase. Overall, no particular trends 
were observed.   A long term safety study has been proposed by the Applicant as a pharmacovigilance 
measure (Observational Cohort Study of Galcanezumab Utilisation and Long-Term Safety Including 
Cardiovascular Safety, Malignancy, and Serious Hypersensitivity). In this study, the incidence of 
malignancy among patients exposed to galcanezumab will be followed over a period of up to 5 years. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities counted as adverse events mostly occurred to the same extent among GMB 
treated patients and placebo treated patients. Most of them seem disparate and do not consist of any 
clusters or patterns. More patients experienced TE low monocyte count in the GMB 240 mg group vs 
placebo, but there was no clinically relevant pattern. Reviewing data for analytes coupled to glucose and 
lipid metabolism, no differences of interest were found for GMB versus placebo.

ECG 
No thorough QT/QTc study was performed and only ECG data from the clinical development program are 
available.  
In Analysis set A, no patient presented QTcF >500 ms and a similar proportion of galcanezumab-treated 
patients and placebo had treatment-emergent changes (low and high) in heart rate, PR interval, and 
QTcF.  
In Analysis set E, a trend towards higher frequency of QTcF prolongation with higher GMB dose was 
observed (>30 msec increase in QTcF: <120:1/130, 0.77%;  120 mg: 10/853, 1.2%, 240 mg: 26/1148, 
2.3%; 300 mg: 9/165, 5.5%). Similarly stratification of QTcF according to cut off values of >450 ms, 
>480 and >500 ms showed that the highest frequency of cases with QTcF >450 ms occurred with 
increasing doses (<120:0;  120 mg: 25/853, 2.93%, 240 mg: 37/1148, 3.22%; 300 mg: 18/165, 
10.91%). Four patients reached the >480 ms limit, one in the the 240 mg GMB dose group and 4 in the 
300 mg dose group (n=3).However the limited number of patients exposed to GMB 300 mg compared 
with lower GMB doses (120 and 240 mg) does not allow to draw definitive conclusions. A comparison of 
Analysis set E with the pooled GMB group from analysis set A, shows a 3.5-4.4 times increase in 
incidence. 
Safety in special populations 
Concurrent prophylaxis other than GMB 
Study CGAI, the only placebo-controlled study including patients with chronic migraine, allowed for up to 
approximately one-third of the patients to continue on topiramate or propranolol for migraine prevention 
if they had been on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to the prospective baseline period. Of the 
14.6% of patients on concurrent migraine prevention at the time of randomization, 10.1% of patients 
received topiramate and 4.5% received propranolol.  
Subgroup analysis of common TEAEs by baseline concurrent prophylaxis use did not indicate any clinically 
meaningful differences in incidence of these AEs in patients with or without concurrent prophylaxis use. 
Analysis of vital signs and weight by concurrent prophylaxis subgroups (yes/no) found a statistically 
significant interaction between concurrent prophylaxis and treatment group on both systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure, the overall LSMean difference between the galcanezumab 
240-mg dose group and placebo was -3.62 for the concurrent prophylaxis use ‘yes’ group, versus -0.03 
for the ‘no’ group. Only 2 of the patients in the galcanezumab 240-mg dose group (1 receiving propranolol 
and the other on topiramate) had a treatment emergent decrease in either systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure. 
There are possible differences in medical history, concomitant medications and co-morbidities between 
chronic migraine and episodic migraine patients. The Applicant provided a review of SAEs, discontinuation 
due to AEs, EAIRs of TEAEs, EAIRs of TEAEs likely CV in nature, and EAIRs of categorical changes in blood 
pressure. Overall, there were no signs of interaction by disease state (episodic or chronic migraine). 
Patients with renal impairment 
The migraine development program included patients with mild renal impairment (Analysis set B: PBO 
365 patients, GMB: 353 patients; Analysis Set E: 569 patients), moderate renal impairment (Analysis set 
B: PBO 17 patients, GMB: 19 patients; Analysis Set E: 31 patients)and only one patient with severe renal 
impairment.  In Analysis Set E, the frequency of SAEs and discontinuation due to AEs were similar for 
galcanezumab-treated patients with normal, mild, or moderate renal function.  In Analysis Set B, the 
frequency of SAEs and discontinuation due to AEs in the moderate renal impairment group (5.26%) was 
higher compared with the normal and mild impaired renal function subgroup (SAEs: around 1%; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 118/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation due to AEs around 2%); this was due to 1 patient treated with galcanezumab in the 
moderate impairment group that reported an SAE and discontinued due to an AE of acute pancreatitis. 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar for galcanezumab treated patients with normal, mild or moderate 
renal function in Analysis set B and E.  Incidence rates of categorical changes in blood pressure were 
similar across the renal function subgroup in Analysis Set E and in Analysis Set B, apart from the 
moderate impairment group in Analysis set B, were 2 patients that met the criteria for the high SBP 
resulted in a higher incidence (10.5%) in this group than in the galcanezumab treated patients in the 
normal (3.6%) and mild (2.6%) groups. No further patients with moderate renal impairment experienced 
high systolic blood pressure in Analysis set E. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment have been excluded from GMB clinical development program. 
Use in pregnancy  
Effects of galcanezumab on human foetal development are not known. Pregnant and lactating women 
were excluded from entering the clinical studies and pregnancy was a criterion for permanent 
discontinuation. Women in reproductive age are the main target subpopulation and pregnancy is included 
in the Safety specification as Missing information. Some studies have shown that CGRP is involved in the 
fetoplacental resistance and an important factor in blood pressure regulation during pregnancy and low 
CGRP levels have been associated with pre-eclampsia (Yallampalli et al 1998, Dong et al 2005 and Fei et 
al 2012). Experience in pregnancy is still very limited. Of 16 pregnancies, reported in total since the 
original submission, one pregnant patient has experienced pre-eclampsia (6.25% of pregnancies). On 
these grounds, hypertension during pregnancy and pre-eclampsia have been included in the safety 
specification as an important potential risk.  The outcomes of the 16 pregnancies were the following: 6 
normal outcomes; two pregnancy outcomes are pending. One premature baby (34 weeks) was delivered 
of a mother who experienced pre-eclampsia and underwent a caesarean section. The infant did not 
experience any complications, and the mother recovered the same day from pre-eclampsia. There was 1 
elective termination and 2 spontaneous abortions.  4 patients were lost to follow-up despite multiple 
attempts to obtain outcome information. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As a humanized Immunoglobulin (subclass) 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody, galcanezumab is expected to 
be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as 
endogenous IgG. Based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of galcanezumab, drug interactions are 
not expected. Therefore, no drug interaction studies were conducted.  
In Study CGAI 157 patients were using topiramate or propranolol as concurrent migraine prophylaxis at 
the time of randomisation (see previous section “Concurrent prophylaxis other than GMB”).   
Available safety data do not indicate a worse safety profile in GMB treated patients receiving concomitant 
oral contraceptives compared with galcanezumab treated patients not receiving oral contraceptives. 
The very limited number of patients who received a PDE5 inhibitor in the galcanezumab clinical 
development program (4 patients randomized to placebo and 5 randomized to galcanezumab) do not 
allow to draw any conclusion on the possible PD interaction between PDE5 inhibitors and galcanezumab. 
This issue should be monitored in upcoming PSURs.

The Applicant provided safety data stratified by concomitant triptan use.  Available data show a higher 
risk of EAIRs of TEAEs likely cardiovascular in nature among galcanezumab treated patients receiving 
concomitant triptans compared to placebo (5.54/ 4.43= 1.25) when receiving concomitant triptans 
compared to the corresponding treatment difference in triptan non users (3.95/ 5.83= 0.68), even 
though the treatment-by-triptan subgroup interaction was not statistically significant. Available data also 
show a higher risk of potentially clinically significant DBP increase among galcanezumab treated patients 
receiving concomitant triptans compared to placebo (2.76/ 1.11: 2.49) when receiving concomitant 
triptans compared to corresponding treatment difference in triptan non users (0.72/ 1.96: 0.37), with a 
statistically significant treatment-by-triptan subgroup interaction.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Analysis set A, a higher frequency of discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred in the GMB 240 mg dose 
group (3%), compared to GMB 120 mg (1.8%) and PBO (1.6%). Adverse events that led to 
discontinuation in ≥2 galcanezumab-treated patients were: migraine, injection site reaction, hepatic 
enzyme increased, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased. 
From the limited available long term data it seems that there is no trend of an increase in discontinuations 
due to AEs with longer treatment duration when comparing Analysis Set A  (up to 6 months treatment 
duration) with Analysis Set E (up to 12 months treatment duration), even though the limited long term 
data do not allow to draw definitive conclusions. 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
A total of 3156 subjects (including 419 healthy subjects) were exposed to galcanezumab at any dose 
across the entire galcanezumab development program.  At the dose range of 120 to 240 mg (Analysis set 
E, all migraine patients), 1920 migraine patients were exposed to galcanezumab for ≥6 months (≥6 
monthly doses), and 526 patients were exposed to galcanezumab for 1 year (12 monthly doses). Thus the 
number of patients exposed long term is limited, even though the extent of exposure in the efficacious 
dose range of 120 to 240 mg in the galcanezumab safety database meets the exposure requirement 
consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance.  
For evaluation of galcanezumab safety, 5 integrated analysis sets and 3 additional analysis sets were 
generated. All safety analyses used the safety population, which was defined as all randomized patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Most important was  Analysis Set A including data from 
the double-blind treatment phase for all Phase 3 placebo-controlled migraine prevention studies: CGAG 
and CGAH, 6 months double blind phase and CGAI, 3 months double blind phase. Analysis Set E included 
data from all galcanezumab-treated patients (placebo was not included), regardless of dose, from all 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 migraine prevention studies. Long-term study CGAJ was also informative due to 
fixed randomised doses and duration of 12 months. 
Analysis Set A, which includes placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment phase data from Studies CGAG, 
CGAH, and CGAI was the dataset used as the basis for proposed labelling. However the duration of 
galcanezumab exposure in this dataset is only up to 6 months.  In Integrated Analysis Set A, a total of 
1435 migraine patients were exposed to galcanezumab, representing 536.3 patient-years of exposure, 
equally distributed between GMB 120 and 240 mg.

The patient population included in Phase 3 galcanezumab clinical trials is not entirely representative of 
the population in the sought indication, as it is well known from epidemiological studies that migraine 
patients are at higher risk of ischemic cardiovascular events and have increased cardiovascular 
morbidities compared to the non-migraine population.  Patients at high risk of cardiovascular events were 
excluded from the phase 3 clinical trials.  No patient reported a pre-existing condition or medical history 
of variant or microvascular angina at baseline. Thus no information is available as to whether treatment 
with galcanezumab could trigger a reoccurrence or worsening of variant or microvascular angina. 
Mean age of enrolled patients was 41 years, with only 5.8% of patients aged between 60 and 65 years at 
baseline. No patients over 65 years were enrolled in GMB studies.  
In Analysis set A, as expected, TEAEs occurred with higher frequency in GMB treated patients (62.5% 
GMB 120 mg, 64.7% GMB 240 mg) compared to 57% in PBO.  Serious adverse events occurred in 1.7% 
and 1.5% patients respectively in GMB 120 mg and 240 mg dose, compared to 0.96% in PBO.  No deaths 
were reported in the migraine studies.  Two deaths were reported across the entire galcanezumab 
development program. Both subjects received galcanezumab treatment, but neither death was attributed 
by investigators to galcanezumab. 
In Analysis set A, a higher frequency of discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred in the GMB 240 mg dose 
group (3%), compared to GMB 120 mg (1.8%) and PBO (1.6%). Adverse events that led to 
discontinuation in ≥2 galcanezumab-treated patients were: migraine, injection site reaction, hepatic 
enzyme increased, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased.  
Significantly more patients discontinued due to AEs in the GMB 240 mg group (3.01%) compared to 
placebo (1.65%). Slightly higher incidence proportions are seen in set E, likely due to longer study 
duration. 
Common TEAEs that occurred with higher frequency in GMB treated patients compared to PBO and that 
have been identified as ADR are injection site reactions (GMB 240 mg 22.8%, GMB 120 mg 18.2%, PBO 
12.8%), constipation (GMB 240 mg 1.51%, GMB 120 mg 0.99%, PBO 0.55%),  vertigo (GMB 240 mg 
1.2%, GMB 120 mg 0.7% vs PBO 0.2%) and hypersensitivity TEAEs (those judged likely after medical 
review, up to 4.8% using the Hypersensitivity SMQ broad search vs PBO 3.3%). 
The majority of injection site reactions occurred on the same day of treatment and resolved the same day 
or within ≤14 days, with no SAEs. Discontinuation due to any type of AE at the injection site occurred in 
0.48% of patients (7/1435 GMB treated patients, mostly after reporting the event multiple times prior to 
discontinuation), compared with no patient treated with PBO, and all resolved without sequelae after 
discontinuation. The percentage of patients reporting severe pain was comparable between the 
galcanezumab pooled group (9.6%) and placebo (13.0%). Injection site events tended to occur more 
frequently with the autoinjector penn compared to the pre-filled syringe.  
Gastrointestinal motility is considered to be modulated by CGRP. Persistent constipation (resolved in >30 
days) occurred more frequently in GMB treated patients than in PBO. In three patients in the GMB 120 mg 
dose group constipation persisted for >90 days.  
Vertigo has been identified as ADRs, also considering the biological plausibility of an association between 
the inhibition of CGRP and interference with cochlear and vestibular function. Although hearing disorders 
were reported in patients treated with galcanezumab (4 GMB treated patients reported events coded as 
hearing loss during treatment compared with no such events in PBO), the number of cases reported was 
low. For two patients there were well-described confounders, such as ear infections or cerumen 
impaction. None of the events coded as hearing loss were SAE and no patient discontinued treatment due 
to a hearing loss event. It is thus unclear whether the reported term truly reflects medically significant 
CHMP assessment report

hearing loss (deafness) versus a transitory phenomenon. The Applicant will keep this safety topic under 
close surveillance and will provide updates in future periodic safety update reports (PSURs)/periodic 
benefit-risk evaluation reports (PBRERs). 
Hypersensitivity reactions, both immediate and non-immediate, were significantly more common in GMB 
patients (0.98%, 3.83%) than in placebo (0.34%, 2.31%). Injection site reactions were the most 
common hypersensitivity AEs. In analysis set A, two cases of urticaria in the GMB 120 mg group (0.3%) 
gave a statistically significant difference compared to placebo (no case). In total, urticaria was reported in 
0.4% of patients treated with any galcanezumab dose in analysis set E. There were two SAEs, both due 
to non-immediate urticaria. These occurred during open label (study CGAI) or in the post treatment 
phase. Urticaria was the cause of discontinuation in 5 patients in analysis set E. 
The incidence proportion of broad scope anaphylactic reactions was almost double in patients with TE 
ADA, a difference that is significant (p=0.019) when the post treatment phase is included. 
Hypersensitivity reactions don’t reach statistical significance, but there is a trend (p=0.059) when post 
treatment phases is added. Injection site hypersensitivity and inflammation were also more frequent in 
ADA+ patients.  The Applicant was thus requested to further assess a possible association between 
immunogenicity and TEAEs. A patient level examination of TEAEs of interest in patients with 
treatment-emergent ADA was conducted. Overall, this review did not demonstrate a clear temporal 
association between these AEs and the presence of treatment-emergent ADA. 
For the following events that occurred with higher frequency in GMB treated patients compared with PBO, 
further discussion has been requested: weight increased (6.4% GMB, vs 5.2% PBO); gastric ulcers 
(3/1435 events, 0.2% vs no such event in PBO); pneumonia (GMB Pooled: 9/ 1435, 0.6%, PBO 2/1451, 
0.14%). From the limited available long term data, it seems that there is a trend towards an increase in 
the frequency of weight increase  with longer treatment duration, when comparing Analysis Set A  (up to 
6 months treatment duration) with Analysis Set E (up to 12 months treatment duration), even though the 
limited long term data do not allow to draw definitive conclusions. Overall, there does not appear to be a 
clear causal relationship between treatment with galcanezumab and weight gain. The updated safety data 
for Analysis Set E showed a lower proportion of patients with weight increase (6.6%) measured at Month 
12 as compared with at the initial submission (9.3%) and there was no clear trend over time.  There is 
conflicting literature data on the relationship between body weight and migraine but it can be agreed that 
migraine itself could form a confounding factor. 
Combining the terms Gastric ulcer and Peptic ulcer, the following frequencies were observed:  GMB 120 
mg 1 patient 0.14%; GMB 240 mg 2 patients 0.27%; GMB Pooled 3 patients, 0.21%; PBO 2 patients 
0.14%.  The Applicant acknowledged the biological plausibility that implicates calcitonin gene-related 
peptide (CGRP) in ulcer healing. However, in the Applicant’s view there is  not sufficient evidence in the 
galcanezumab safety database, to indicate a possible causal relationship between gastric ulcer and 
galcanezumab treatment.  It is acknowledged that the number of events is small and that available data 
do not allow to draw conclusions on a possible causal relationship between gastric and peptic ulcers and 
galcanezumab treatment. Available safety data on the occurrence of TEAEs potentially correlated to 
compromized ulcer/ wound healing (i.e. not limited to gastric and peptic ulcers) was requested. No clear 
imbalance in the frequencies of adverse events correlated to ulcer healing (GMB Pooled 0.4% vs PBO: 
0.3%) and of wound-related events  (GMB Pooled: 0.3% vs PBO: 0.2%) was observed in Analysis Set A 
between galcanezumab and placebo.  None of the events were reported as serious.  The only event 
reported as impaired healing occurred in a 52 year old patient, 19 days after the fifth monthly dose; the 
event was considered drug related by the investigator, even though the event was confounded by 
concomitant use of corticosteroids. The issue of impaired healing should be monitored in upcoming 
PSUR’s.

In analysis by SOC, pneumonia occurred significantly more in GMB treated patients (9/1435) than in 
placebo treated patients (2/1451) p=0.033 (GMB Pooled: 9/ 1435, 0.6%: 5 patients GMB 240, 4 patients 
GMB 120; PBO 2/1451 0.14%). In the investigator’s opinion all of these events except one were not 
related to study drug. None of the cases of pneumonia resulted in discontinuation of treatment or were 
reported as SAEs.  There was no apparent pattern in time to onset of the events, with the cases resolving, 
and all of the patients completed the treatment phases of the respective studies.  The available data, 
together with the lack of clear biological plausibility with galcanezumab treatment, do not currently 
support consideration of pneumonia as an ADR associated with galcanezumab treatment. The issue will be 
monitored in upcoming PSURs. 
Regarding hepatic safety, no patient met criteria for Hy’s law. There were 13 GMB treated patients and 
7 placebo treated patients who had ≥ 3 x ULN of ALT. Several of these had baseline elevation.  Data on 
liver associated averse events from the different dose groups in analysis set E don’t imply any dose 
dependent AEs related to hepatic safety, but increased ALP, ALT and AST occurred in slightly increased 
proportions of patients in the higher GMB doses. At this time there is insufficient evidence to classify 
increased hepatic enzymes an adverse reaction associated with galcanezumab treatment. The issue will 
be monitored in upcoming PSURs. 
Data from patients in the Phase 3 migraine clinical program do not suggest a risk of suicidal behaviour or 
ideation among those treated with galcanezumab. 
Cardiovascular safety was identified as AESI because calcitonin gene-related peptide, being a potent 
microvascular  vasodilator, is hypothesized to play a protective role in cardiovascular health. Nonclinical 
studies suggest that CGRP plays an important role in facilitating vasodilatation to various stimuli including 
acute ischaemia (Russell et al. 2014), and CGRP receptors are known to be expressed on cardiomyocytes, 
particularly within the conduction system. The binding of GMB to soluble CGRP could thus counteract the 
effect of CGRP on cardiovascular system. Even though in the placebo-controlled studies (analysis set A) 
there is no apparent clear imbalance in cardiovascular TEAEs, there were several TEAEs likely 
cardiovascular in nature that occurred in galcanezumab clinical trials..  Furthermore, there were single 
occurrences of SAEs thrombotic or embolic in nature  (such as myocardial infarction, transient ischemic 
attack), and a SAE of atrial fibrillation, in patients without cardiovascular risk factors or other possible 
alternative explanations,  for whom, a causal relationship between galcanezumab and these events may 
not be excluded.  In Analysis set A, no patient presented QTcF >500 ms and a similar proportion of 
galcanezumab-treated patients and placebo had treatment-emergent changes (low and high) in heart 
rate, PR interval, and QTcF. However, in Analysis set E, a trend towards higher frequency of QTcF 
prolongation with higher GMB dose was observed (>30 msec increase in QTcF: <120:1/130, 0.77%;  120 
mg: 10/853, 1.17%, 240 mg: 26/1148, 2.26%; 300 mg: 9/165, 5.45%). Similarly a higher frequency of 
cases with QTcF >450 ms occurred with increasing doses (<120:0;  120 mg: 25/853, 2.93%, 240 mg: 
37/1148, 3.22%; 300 mg: 18/165, 10.91%). Again differences in dose group sizes prevents sound 
conclusions. Concentration effect modelling has been provided. to investigate the effect of GMB serum 
concentrations on QT interval prolongation.  Galcanezumab concentration-ΔQTcF modelling seams to 
support the conclusion that galcanezumab does not prolong QTcF interval at the doses evaluated in the 
Phase 3 migraine program. 
In conclusion due to the trial exclusion criteria, the generalizability of the clinical trial results as regards 
to cardiovascular safety to the entire patient population in the sought indication is limited given that the 
following patients were excluded: Patients with recent acute cardiovascular events (including MI, 
unstable angina, CABG, stroke, DVT) and/or those deemed to be at serious cardiovascular risk. 
Furthermore, the consequences of chronic CGRP inhibition in patients are unknown. The limited number 
of patients exposed to galcanezumab up to 12 months -together with the decreasing number of patients 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 123/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with higher number of doses- do not allow to assess if there is an increased cardiovascular risk associated 
with long term galcanezumab exposure. Further, no patient has received galcanezumab for more than 12 
months, thus cardiovascular risks and safety, especially ischemic events, cannot be fully assessed yet.  
Available data did not identify meaningful differences in SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, TEAEs likely 
CV in nature, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with a history of either hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes (the so-called “CV disease risk group”) and 
in patients aged ≥60 to 65 years. However patients at higher cardiovascular risk [i.e. patients with  
recent acute CV events and/or serious CV risk and elderlies (>65 years of age)] were excluded from 
galcanezumab clinical development program. Furthermore, long term safety data are missing.  A warning 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC has been added on the absence of safety data in patients with major 
cardiovascular diseases. 
The applicant is proposing to conduct a Category 3 post-authorisation observational study as an 
additional pharmacovigilance activity. This study will examine the utilisation of galcanezumab in patients 
with current or recent acute CV risk factors and also the incidence of serious CV outcomes in all 
galcanezumab-treated patients. The proposed PASS has been split into 2 similar studies based on region 
(US and Europe). In both studies, the primary objective is to evaluate the utilisation and long-term safety 
of galcanezumab, including cardiovascular safety, malignancy, and serious hypersensitivity events in 
routine clinical practice. In Europe, the primary objective will relate to a European cohort of 
galcanezumab users, with exposures to galcanezumab identified from pharmacy records and safety 
outcomes identified through medical claims or records. Medical record review will complement the 
database analysis where feasible to obtain additional information on confounders. The utilisation of 
galcanezumab and the incidence of relevant safety outcomes will be described overall and within 
populations of special interest (patients with recent acute cardiovascular events and/or serious 
cardiovascular risk prior to initiating galcanezumab, and patients ≥65 years of age). In the US study, a 
secondary objective is to conduct, based on the number of events observed, comparative safety analyses 
of cardiovascular events, serious hypersensitivity reactions, and malignancies using patients initiated on 
other prophylactic migraine medication as a control, as feasible based on the number of outcome events 
observed. For these comparative analyses, adult patients who initiated treatment with another 
prophylactic migraine medication will be included and matched to galcanezumab initiators using 
propensity score or similar methods. The proposal to conduct such a study is considered acceptable. The 
Applicant states that limitations in the anticipated size and access of data sources available in Europe are 
unlikely to make comparative assessment feasible in the European study. However, the size of the data 
sources under consideration is potentially sizeable, exceeding 100 million patients (as shown by the 
Applicant in table format in the RMP v 0.3) and as the number of pre-specified safety events observed is 
unknown, the Applicant should retain the possibility to conduct comparative analyses with new users of 
comparator medications in Europe as well. This has been accepted by the applicant and included as a 
secondary objective in the PASS synopsis for the European study, similar to the US study (RMP v 0.4). 
Available data show a higher risk of TEAEs likely CV in nature among galcanezumab treated males 
compared to placebo (4.85/ 2.45= 1.98) compared to the same risk in females (4.68/ 5.60= 0.83), with 
a statistically significant treatment by sex subgroup interaction overall. Thus, available data suggest that 
galcanezumab treatment increases cardiovascular risk (evaluated as occurrence of TEAEs likely 
cardiovascular in nature) in males significantly more than in females. However given the limited number 
of events observed among males –as more than 80% of the migraine patient population included in the 
galcanezumab clinical development program was female- no definitive conclusion may be drawn. 
Cardiovascular safety data by sex will be further evaluated in the long term PASS.

A SAE of severe arterial thrombosis complicated by popliteal artery occlusion occurred in a 41 year old 
diabetic female, with multiple risk factors for cardiac, as well as thromboembolic, disease 43 days after 
the sixth and final dose of galcanezumab (300 mg every 2 weeks); despite thrombectomy and tissue 
plasminogen activator (TPA) administration, adequate arterial blood flow could not be restored to the 
lower limb and the patient underwent an above the knee amputation. The investigator considered the 
event of peripheral vascular disease as not related to galcanezumab. No patients reported a TEAE of 
peripheral vascular disease in Analysis Set A; 2 patients from the Phase 2 studies (Analysis Sets B and E) 
and 1 patient from the long-term safety study CGAJ (Analysis Set E) who reported Raynaud’s 
phenomenon (1), peripheral coldness (1), and intermittent claudication (1).  The intermittent claudication 
was due to a muscular problem, the Raynaud’s phenomenon was a worsening event in pre-existing 
Raynaud and did not re-occur with continued treatment, and for the peripheral coldness (“coldness in 
hands and feet”) no additional details were provided. Peripheral vascular disease will be monitored in 
upcoming PSURs. 
The Applicant provided safety data stratified by patients with and without aura. As regards to 
discontinuation due to an AE likely cardiovascular in nature a higher number of patients with aura 
discontinued due to a TEAE likely CV in nature compared to patients without aura, but this occurred both 
in galcanezumab treated patients and in PBO. EAIRs of TEAEs likely CV in nature using SMQs found no 
significant treatment-by-aura subgroup interaction in Analysis Set A, and no evidence that patients with 
aura treated with galcanezumab reported increased CV TEAEs.  The EAIRs in Analysis Set E were 
comparable to Analysis Set A. As regards to Exposure Adjusted Incidence Rates (EAIRs) of Categorical 
Changes in Blood Pressure by Aura Status in Analysis Set A, a higher incidence of SBP high was observed 
both in galcanezumab and in placebo treated patients with aura status, compared to patients without 
aura; conversely a higher incidence of DBP high in patients with aura status, compared to those without 
aura was observed only among galcanezumab-treated patients but not in patients treated with placebo. 
There was no statistically significant treatment-by-aura subgroup interaction in Analysis Set A. To further 
investigate the possibility of an effect of galcanezumab mostly on DBP rather than on SBP, the Applicant 
conducted a time-to-event analysis for events of 2 consecutive measures of increased blood pressure ≥
10 mmHg in DBP or increased blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg in SBP.  Because isolated increases of blood 
pressure might be due to inherent biological variability, the occurrence of 2 consecutive measurements of 
high blood pressure was considered a more reliable assessment of a true increase.  These analyses 
showed that the incidence of sustained high diastolic blood pressure in patients treated for up to 6 months 
with galcanezumab was not greater than placebo across all timepoints. 
The Applicant provided the requested safety data stratified by concomitant triptan use.  Available data 
show a higher risk of EAIRs of TEAEs likely cardiovascular in nature among galcanezumab treated patients 
receiving concomitant triptans compared to placebo (5.54/ 4.43= 1.25) compared to the same risk in 
triptan non users (3.95/ 5.83= 0.68), even though the treatment-by-triptan subgroup interaction was not 
statistically significant. Available data also show a higher risk of potentially clinically significant DBP 
increase among galcanezumab treated patients receiving concomitant triptans compared to placebo 
(2.76/ 1.11= 2.49) compared to the same risk in triptan non users (0.72/ 1.96= 0.37), with a statistically 
significant treatment-by-triptan subgroup interaction.  Considering the number of endpoints analysed to 
evaluate increases at any time in SBP and DBP (e.g., categorical and treatment-emergent high SBP or 
DBP, potentially clinically significant increases in SBP or DBP, sustained SBP or DBP increases), it is not 
possible to exclude that the observed statistically significant treatment by triptan subgroup interaction 
observed for potentially clinically significant DBP increase -being an isolated treatment by subgroup 
interaction finding- could be a spurious finding due to multiplicity. Moreover, contributing to the observed 
interaction was a lower incidence rate of potentially clinically significant high DBP in galcanezumab 
patients compared to placebo among non triptan users.

The applicant provided a review of SAEs, discontinuation due to AEs, EAIRs of TEAEs, EAIRs of TEAEs 
likely CV in nature, and EAIRs of categorical changes in blood pressure. Overall, there were no signs of 
interaction by disease state (episodic or chronic migraine). 
In placebo controlled trials, analysis of blood pressure does not show any increase for GMB-treated 
patients, rather a minimal decrease in the higher dose. However, looking at analysis set E which contains 
data from all clinical phase 2/3 trials, including lower and higher doses than in analysis set A, there might 
be an increase in blood pressure with increased dose. These data are difficult to interpret due to different 
study durations and imbalances in patient number among dose groups.  
Incidence proportions and incidence rates for SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg increase from baseline and DBP increase 
≥ 10mm Hg from baseline regardless of thresholds were provided. In the placebo-controlled Analysis Set 
A, no relevant differences were observed between galcanezumab and placebo. Some inconsistencies 
were noted in Set E which might be explained by small sample sizes for some of the groups. Spaghetti 
plots for SBP or DBP by dose level showed no notable differences in the patterns of fluctuation over time 
between the groups. The Applicant also provided a time-to-event analysis with event defined as 2 
consecutive measures of increased blood pressure ≥ 10 mmHg in DBP and/or ≥ 20 mmHg in SBP OR new 
anti-hypertensive treatment. This analysis showed no increased risk in galcanezumab-treated patients 
compared to placebo based on the stratified hazard ratio. 
There seems to more patients in the higher dose groups who received or increased anti-hypertensive 
drugs throughout the studies, but the same issue with data as described for high blood pressure applies. 
However, long term study CGAJ, where doses were fixed and exposure time similar for both GMB doses, 
shows a greater proportion of patients with an increase in anti-hypertensive treatment in the higher GMB 
dose group. 
The incidences of several important adverse events, notably treatment emergent high blood pressure, 
use of cardiovascular medications, QTc interval, rash, and liver enzymes, suggest imbalances between 
the GMB groups in the overall integrated analysis set (analysis set E), but no corresponding imbalances 
are apparent in primary placebo-controlled comparisons (analysis set A). When looking at analysis set E, 
study CGAI, and study CGAJ, there is even some suggestion of a dose dependent increase of these 
events. In order to clarify if the previously mentioned imbalances indicate true adverse reactions or have 
other methodological explanations, the Applicant provided exposure-adjusted analyses using 
time-at-risk-adjusted incidence rate (per 100 patient-years) for treatment-emergent hypertension, QTc 
interval, use of CV medications, rash, and hepatic enzymes. Overall, these analyses do not show dose 
dependent effects compared between galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg. The EAIRs for the 300 mg dose 
are numerically more unfavourable compared to the other dose groups for a range of events, including 
treatment-emergent systolic blood pressure, use of concomitant antihypertensives (increase in dose or 
start of new medication), rash of potential or likely hypersensitivity in nature, and treatment-emergent 
abnormally high hepatic enzyme values (ALP, ALAT, ASAT). The apparent consistency in this 
unfavourable trend is something to be considered although the Applicant’s explanation that the GMB 300 
mg data originate from small patient numbers from Phase 2 studies and hence are associated with wide 
confidence intervals is acknowledged. Also, the duration of follow-up in these Phase 2 studies was limited, 
up to 12 weeks. Study CGAJ appears to be sufficiently consistent with Analysis Sets E and A except for a 
relatively low incidence rate of high DBP in the 120 mg treatment group compared to the other data sets. 
The EAIRs for the CV concomitant medications were higher for the galcanezumab 240 mg dose group 
compared to galcanezumab 120 mg for all 4 medication classes for the ‘All Patients’ group and CV Disease 
Risk Group-Yes. These differences appear to be driven by the patients in the CV Disease Risk Group-Yes; 
however, the numbers are small with only 50 patients in the Yes group for this study, with wide 
confidence intervals.

The applicant was requested to provide a descriptive analysis of frequency of dose-changes in relation to 
dose and duration of exposure and to discuss the reasons for dose change. The majority of the dose 
changes occurred at the third dose where 62.2% patients moved up to galcanezumab 240 mg from 120 
mg. An additional 11.4% moved up to 240 mg at the next dose with smaller numbers thereafter. Fewer 
patients moved back down to galcanezumab 120 mg across subsequent visits, about 3 to 5% per visit. 
Overall, there was a fair amount of fluctuation throughout the open-label phase. In study CGAI 
(open-label) the majority of dose changes relate to increased dosage in aiming for additional therapeutic 
benefit; thus available data do not indicate safety issues as a reason for dose change.  
Acute pancreatitis.  One SAE of pancreatitis and gallstones and another SAE with cholelithiasis are 
noted in the GMB 120 mg group. Among less common AEs, upper abdominal pain was significantly 
more common in GMB treated patients (pooled 0.98%) than placebo (0.34%). CGRP has been stated 
to be a regulator of biliary flow (Rasmussen et al) and to be involved in sphincter Oddi (Sand et al).   
Overall, based on the study data and literature references, it cannot be excluded that inhibition of 
CGRP could play a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and/or bile duct related disorders. However, 
the current data do not evoke a safety concern. There will be renewed review of this issue when 
additional safety data become available. 
The applicant has provided a discussion of the potential effects of CGRP on the urinary tract and 
whether inhibition of CGRP could lead to urinary tract related adverse events. Overall, based on the 
current data, there appears to be limited evidence for this. In Analysis Set A were 3 patients in the 
galcanezumab pooled dose group (0.21%) and 1 patient in the placebo group (0.07%) who reported 
pyelonephritis or acute pyelonephritis. While indicates a small imbalance, none of the events in the 
galcanezumab-treated patients was considered related to treatment by study investigator, none led to 
discontinuation, and none re-occurred. In addition, 1 case of nephritis was reported in a 
placebo-treated patient and none in galcanezumab-treated patients. Estimates of EAIRs related to 
these disorders did not indicate an increase in incidence rates by dose or continued exposure. 
Nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently in placebo-treated patients (0.41%) than in 
galcanezumab-treated patients (0.21%). Of interest, as stated by the Applicant, patients with 
migraine have been reported to have increased risk for developing urinary calculi. One of several 
possible explanations might be an inhibitory effect of CGRP on the motility of the human ureter, which 
may promote ureteral obstruction due to urine stasis and urinary calculi (Tsai et al, 2015). A 
presentation of other TEAEs (bladder dysfunction, renal colic, and hypertonic bladder) showed similar 
frequencies between the groups.  Overall, the Applicant’s conclusion that there was no clinically 
meaningful difference observed between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo that suggests a 
relationship of the reported renal AEs to galcanezumab exposure can be agreed. 
Malignancies. Three serious cases (0.3%) of malignant neoplasms (adenocarcinoma of the cervix, 
colon cancer, tubular breast carcinoma) were reported in the galcanezumab 120-mg dose group, 
compared to no such event in the PBO group.  Furthermore one serious case of benign tumour (rectal 
polyp) occurred in another GMB treated subject. None of these cases were considered related to GMB 
treatment by the Investigator. A further event (galcanezumab 120 mg group, Analysis Set A) included 
in the initial submission with a PT of wound (“wound nipple left breast”) that started on Study Day 19, 
was diagnosed months later as breast nipple cancer.  In view of the relatively short time interval 
between the start of galcanezumab treatment and the event onset, a causal association with 
galcanezumab is unlikely. Non clinical data showed a single occurrence of fibrosarcoma in the 
skin/subcutis in the rat for which a relationship with the compound has not been excluded. In Analysis 
Set A, when combining all neoplasms, benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), 
these were more frequently reported among GMB exposed patients regardless of dose (0.71% and 
0.68% for 120 mg and 240 mg, respectively) compared to placebo (0.28%). Almost all events were

single cases. The EAIR for the Neoplasm SOC in Analysis Set E was similar to that of Set A. The EAIR 
in Study CGAJ was numerically higher for the galcanezumab 240 mg dose group (EAIR 4.25) compared 
to the other data sets. However, confidence intervals were overlapping. In Analysis Set E, a total of 32 
patients (1.24%) presented benign or malignant events during GMB-treated time and the 
post-treatment phase. No particular trends were observed.  A long term safety study has been 
proposed by the applicant as a pharmacovigilance measure (Observational Cohort Study of 
Galcanezumab Utilisation and Long-Term Safety Including Cardiovascular Safety, Malignancy, and 
Serious Hypersensitivity). In this study, the incidence of malignancy among patients exposed to 
galcanezumab will be followed over a period of up to 5 years. 
Pregnancy. Most patients with migraine are females of child bearing age. CGRP likely contributes to 
vascular adaptations during pregnancy. Pregnant women were excluded from participation in clinical 
studies. Experience in pregnancy is still very limited. Of 16 pregnancies, reported in total since the 
original submission, one pregnant patient has experienced pre-eclampsia (6.25% of pregnancies). 
Given the biological mechanism of galcanezumab and the role of CGRP in pregnancy, there is a 
rationale for including hypertension and pre-eclampsia among women exposed to galcanezumab 
during pregnancy as important potential risks in the RMP. As part of the pharmacovigilance plan, the 
applicant plans to conduct a cohort study (Category 3) of exposure to galcanezumab during pregnancy 
to collect more data on the incidence of pregnancy outcomes (including hypertension during pregnancy 
and preeclampsia) in comparison to women receiving other prophylactic migraine medication. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Galcanezumab was generally well tolerated in migraine patients, although an increase in the incidence of 
injection site reactions, constipation, vertigo, pruritus and urticaria were observed in the 3 to 6 
months-controlled studies. There is a concern that treatment with a CGRP antagonism may aggravate 
ischemic events such as stroke, TIA and MI, because CGRP is hypothesized to play a protective role in 
cardiovascular health. Available data did not identify meaningful differences in SAEs, discontinuations due 
to AEs, TEAEs likely CV in nature, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with a history of either 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes (the so-called “CV disease 
risk group”) and in patients aged ≥ 0 to 65 years. However, these data provide only limited reassurance 
as patients at higher cardiovascular risk [i.e. patients with recent acute CV events and/or serious CV risk 
and elderlies (>65 years of age)] were excluded from galcanezumab clinical development program. To 
address these concerns, the Applicant has proposed to conduct a Category 3 post-authorisation 
observational study as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. The primary objective of the study is to 
understand the utilization of galcanezumab and to characterize the incidence of cardiovascular events, 
malignancy, and serious hypersensitivity in real-world clinical practice.  
526 patients have been exposed for up to 1 year and long-term data in a chronic condition such as 
migraine are missing, so the implications of chronic CGRP inhibition in patients, including the risk of 
malignancies, is at present unknown.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that galcanezumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers galcanezumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Emgality (galcanezumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. In addition, it is a biological product that is not 
covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraine is a chronic neurological disease characterized by severe headache attacks with associated 
hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli, as well as gastrointestinal, cognitive, and vestibular symptoms 
that can be severe and disabling (Buse et al. 2009). Typically, the headaches affect one half of the head, 
are pulsating in nature, and last from 4 to 72 hours without treatment. The disease is associated with 
higher frequencies of depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular risk, chronic pain 
syndromes, and suicide attempts. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In case of infrequent migraine attacks (less than 2 times per month), treatment is limited to acute 
medications that include: triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combination of analgesics, 
opioids, and ergots.   
In case of frequent migraine attacks (2-6 times or more per month) prophylactic drugs are introduced on 
a daily basis, including antihypertensive, anti-epileptic, or antidepressant drugs. Most of the commonly 
used prophylactic drugs have a registered indication, however others are used off-label with limited 
evidence of efficacy. The safety profile of these drugs is not optimal with neurological AEs including 
dizziness, vertigo, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, memory problems, paraesthesia, often requiring dose 
titration, and carrying contraindications and warnings. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in CM and EM provide efficacy and safety 
data of galcanezumab in the prophylaxis of migraine in adults.   
Study CGAG and Study CGAH are pivotal for EM and Study CGAI is pivotal for CM. They all include the 
proposed registration dose of 120 mg, with a loading dose of 240 mg, as well as the 240 mg dose 
regimen.  
Studies CGAG and CGAH have identical design. They are phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled to evaluate the effect of galcanezumab compared to placebo on the overall change 
from baseline in mean monthly migraine days in subjects with episodic migraine. The studies consisted of 
a screening phase; a prospective baseline; 6-month placebo-controlled double-blind treatment and a 
4-month post treatment follow-up (ongoing).  
The studies enrolled patients aged 18 to 65 with a diagnosis of migraine as defined by International 
Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) -3rd edition, beta 
guidelines (1.1 and 1.2) (ICHD-3 2013), with a history of migraine headaches of at least 1 year prior to 
Visit 1, and migraine onset prior to age 50. Recruited patients were to have had a history of 4 to 14 MHDs 
and at least 2 migraine attacks per month on average within the past 3 months.

Study CGAI is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of galcanezumab through the overall mean change from baseline in mean monthly migraine 
headache days as prevention of chronic migraine. The study consisted of a screening phase, a prospective 
baseline phase, a 3-month double blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, an optional 9-month 
open-label extension phase (ongoing) and a 4-month post-treatment follow-up phase (ongoing).  
The study enrolled patients 18 to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of chronic migraine as defined by IHS 
ICHD-3 beta guidelines (1.3) (ICHD-3 2013), i.e. a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for 
more than 3 months, with at least 8 days having features of migraine, and at least 1 headache-free day 
per month for more than 3 months.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For patients with episodic migraine (CGAG and CGAH studies), the superiority over placebo was shown 
both for the primary endpoint as well as for the key secondary endpoints for both galcanezumab doses.  
For patients with chronic migraine (CGAI study), the superiority of both galcanezumab doses vs placebo 
was shown for the primary endpoint and for the key secondary endpoint of Percentage of ≥50% 
Responders for MHDs for both galcanezumab doses. Other key secondary endpoints were met only by the 
240 mg dose.  
Several sensitivity analyses supported the results of the primary analyses in the 3 trials. Overall, there 
was a consistency of treatment effect among several endpoints including impact of disease on functioning 
and patients’ perception of illness severity.   
Primary endpoint. After multiplicity adjustment, the overall LSMean reduction from baseline in the 
number of monthly MHDs during the double-blind treatment phase was: 
In study CGAG:  4.73 days for galcanezumab 120 mg [effect size -0.59] and 4.57 days for 
galcanezumab 240 mg compared with 2.81 days for placebo [effect size -0.54] (LSMean change 
difference from placebo -1.92 and -1.76; p<.001 for each dose group versus placebo).  
In study CGAH, 4.29 days for galcanezumab 120 mg [effect size -0.61] and 4.18 days for galcanezumab 
240 mg compared with 2.28 days for placebo [effect size -0.57] (LSMean change difference from placebo 
-1.9 and -1.8; p<.001 for each dose group versus placebo).   
In Study CGAI: 4.83 days for galcanezumab 120 mg and 4.62 days for galcanezumab 240 mg compared 
with 2.74 days for placebo (LSMean change difference from placebo: -2.09 and -1.88; p<.001 for each 
dose group versus placebo). 
Key secondary endpoints.  
Percentage of ≥50% responders in terms of reduction of MHDs:

placebo 2.63 and 2.48 for 120 mg and 240 mg groups, respectively (<0.001 for both comparisons)  
In study CGAH, 36% for placebo, 59.3% for 120 mg and 56.5% for 240mg group with odds ratio vs 
placebo 2.6 and 2.31 for 120 mg and 240 mg groups, respectively (<0.001 for both comparisons). 
In Study CGAI: 15.4% for placebo, 27.6% for 120 mg and 27.2% for 240 mg group with odds ratio vs 
placebo 2.09 and 2.08 for 120 mg and 240 mg groups, respectively (<0.001 for both comparisons).

In Study CGAI 4.5% for placebo mg and 8.8% for 240mg group odds ratio vs placebo 2.04 for 240 mg 
group (<0.001).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In all 3 studies, the magnitude of treatment effect seems limited; however, it is acknowledged that there 
is no agreed minimal clinically relevant effect in terms of decrease in MHD in the literature or in the clinical 
practice. The applicant has provided tabulated indirect comparison data with available treatments in order 
to contextualise treatment benefit. Overall, galcanezumab treatment effect seems comparable with that 
of historical data from topiramate and Botox published studies. However, although the applicant’s efforts 
are appreciated, the indirect comparison is not supported by a sound methodology, and its usefulness for 
the evaluation of treatment benefit is limited.  
After considering the assumptions for the determination of the sample size in the EM as well as CM trials 
of a mean difference of 1.2 migraine headache days with a SD of 3.6 (corresponding to an effect size of 
0.33), it was evident that the statistical significance would have been reached even with a mean change 
difference compared to placebo smaller than 1 MHD. The provided sensitivity analysis further showed 
that, with the selected sample size, highly statistically significant differences versus placebo could be 
observed even for very small, clinically non-relevant improvements (as reflected by negligible LS mean 
differences). Favourable effects of galcanezumab were shown in patients (age 18-65 years) with episodic 
migraine restricted by frequency of migraine attacks with 4 to 14 monthly migraine headache days in two 
pivotal studies. Upon resolution of a Major Objection raised by the CHMP, the initial indication for “the 
prophylaxis of migraine in adults” has been changed to now include only adult subjects with at least 4 
migraine days per month. Results of a subgroup analysis of primary outcome measure seem to indicate 
that the effect of galcanezumab occurs irrespectively of the baseline number of MHDs (<8 vs ≥8 in EM and 
<19 vs ≥19 in CM) also in patients aged ≥ 50 years. Therefore, the treatment effect of galcanezumab can 
be extrapolated to older patients (≥65 years).  The magnitude of treatment benefit appears limited, 
especially in CM. In the current SmPC, only the 120 mg dose is proposed for all patients. However, it is 
noted that the proportion of patients dosed with 240 mg was increasing with time during open-label phase 
of the CGAI study. The investigators preferred the 240 mg dose when allowed to choose freely for patients 
with chronic migraine. In addition, there were 9.6% of patients in the 120 mg dose group and 3.7% of 
patients in the 240 mg dose group who discontinued the treatment because of lack of efficacy (CGAJ 
study). Based on these observations, the discussion on whether up titrating the effective dose could be 
justified for some patients, e.g. those with chronic migraine, in the case of absence of response to the 120 
mg dose, brought to the conclusion that it remains at the clinician discretion to choose the best dose on 
an individual basis.  
It is not possible to infer from the data provided that treatment effect induces a statistically significant 
reduction in acute medication use, because the change in MHDs with acute medication is considered 
irrespective of the corresponding monthly total number of migraine days. Indeed, looking at the percent 
change in the mean use of paracetamol and triptans from baseline (considered over the past 5 years prior 
to enrolment), to the DB period in the 3 pivotal studies, there seems to be a small decrease in the 3 
studies for galcanezumab when looking at acute treatment overall that reaches statistical significance in 
2 studies (CGAH and CGAI for both doses). For the specific acute medication of triptans, paracetamol and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NSAIDS, there were overall small reduction seen for galcanezumab treatment with only small increases 
for paracetamol in study CGAG at 240 mg galcanezumab dose and study CGAH at 120 mg galcanezumab 
dose. When the severity of remaining migraine days in patients treated with galcanezumab is taken into 
consideration, no difference with placebo is observed across the EM and CM trials. When the severity of 
remaining migraine days is taken into consideration, no difference with placebo is observed in the 
episodic migraine trial CGAG whereas a very small difference of questionable clinical relevance is 
apparent in the chronic migraine trial and episodic migraine trial CGAH.  The additional treatment benefit 
of galcanezumab in patients with CM on treatment with either topiramate or propranolol seems relatively 
small, i.e. 1-day gain. As such, the benefit of galcanezumab treatment in add on to topiramate and 
propanol in CM patients is at present questionable.  
At the time of the dossier submission there were methodological concerns in the conduct of the pivotal 
studies, with a large number of protocol deviations and the lack of a per-protocol analysis. The responses 
provided by the applicant after two rounds of supplementary information in order to bridge this gap (i.e., 
considering the per-protocol population, as well as after excluding subjects with any protocol deviation), 
showed that although the number of subjects in each group for each study was significantly reduced, the 
differences in the reduction of MHDs with respect to the baseline between the groups actively treated with 
galcanezumab vs placebo remained statistically significant in either EM and CM. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Based on the findings from three placebo-controlled trials, two with six months duration and one with 3 
months duration, the following adverse events were considered as adverse drug reactions based on a 
more frequent occurrence than in placebo, dose response finding and biological plausibility:  
 
Injection site pain was reported in 9.51%, 10.07% and 11.64% in subjects in the placebo, 120 
mg and 240 mg groups, respectively. Injection site pain was considered as severe in 9.6% of 
patients. One patient discontinued due to injection site pain. 
Likely immunological ADR: 
• 
Injection site reaction was reported in 1.0%, 3.1% and 6.2% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, 
and 240 mg groups, respectively. The data indicate a dose relationship with twice as many 
patients in the galcanezumab 240-mg dose group reporting an injection site reaction than the 
galcanezumab 120-mg dose group. Four patients discontinued due to injection site reaction. 
• 
Injection site erythema was reported in 1.4%, 2.8% and 4.0% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, 
and 240 mg groups, respectively. One patient discontinued due to injection site erythema. 
• 
Injection site pruritus was reported in 0.1%, 2.1% and 3.3% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, 
and 240 mg groups, respectively. 20% of patients in the 120 mg group experienced injection 
site pruritus as severe and 25% in the 240 mg group. No patient in the placebo group 
experienced injection site pruritus as severe. 
•  Urticaria was reported in 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.1% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, and 240 mg 
groups, respectively. Five patients discontinued due to urticaria. 
•  Pruritus was reported in 0.28%, 0.71% and 1.23% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, and 240 
mg groups, respectively. 
Other ADRs with known biological plausibility: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/708631/2018  
Page 138/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Constipation was reported in 0.55%%, 0.99% and 1.51% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, and 
240 mg groups, respectively. No patients experienced constipation as severe. This ADR could 
be persistent > 30 days or even longer, > 90 days. 
•  Vertigo was reported in 0.21%, 0.7% and 1.23% in subjects in the placebo, 120 mg, and 240 mg 
groups, respectively. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Due to the exclusion criteria of the clinical trials, the generalizability of the safety results to the entire 
patient population of the sought indication is limited. Patients with less than 4 MHDs at baseline, patients 
older than 65 years and patients at high risk of cardiovascular events were excluded from the 3 pivotal 
trials. Migraine patients are at higher risk of ischemic cardiovascular events and have increased 
cardiovascular morbidities compared to the non-migraine population. Nonclinical studies suggest that 
CGRP plays an important role in facilitating vasodilatation to various stimuli including acute ischaemia, 
and CGRP receptors are known to be expressed on cardiomyocytes, particularly within the conduction 
system.  There is a concern that treatment with a CGRP antibody may aggravate ischemic events such as 
stroke, TIA and MI. Even though in the placebo-controlled studies there was no apparent clear imbalance 
in cardiovascular TEAEs, there were several TEAEs likely cardiovascular in nature that occurred in 
galcanezumab clinical trials.  Furthermore, there were single occurrences of SAEs thrombotic or embolic 
in nature (such as myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, superficial thrombophlebitis), and a 
SAE of atrial fibrillation, in patients without cardiovascular risk factors or other possible alternative 
explanations, for whom, a causal relationship between galcanezumab and these events may not be 
excluded.  The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) for the 300 mg dose are numerically more 
unfavourable compared to the other dose groups for a range of events, including treatment-emergent 
systolic blood pressure, use of concomitant antihypertensives (increase in dose or start of new 
medication), rash of potential or likely hypersensitivity in nature, and treatment-emergent abnormally 
high hepatic enzyme values (ALP, ALAT, ASAT). The apparent consistency in this unfavourable trend is 
something to be considered although the Applicant’s explanation that the GMB 300 mg data originate 
from small patient numbers from Phase 2 studies and hence are associated with wide confidence intervals 
is acknowledged. Also, the duration of follow-up in these Phase 2 studies was limited, up to 12 weeks. 
Study CGAJ appears to be sufficiently consistent with Analysis Sets E and A except for a relatively low 
incidence rate of high DBP in the 120 mg treatment group compared to the other data sets. The EAIRs for 
the CV concomitant medications were higher for the galcanezumab 240 mg dose group compared to 
galcanezumab 120 mg for all 4 medication classes for the ‘All Patients’ group and CV Disease Risk 
Group-Yes. These differences appear to be driven by the patients in the CV Disease Risk Group-Yes; 
however, the numbers are small with only 50 patients in the Yes group for this study, with wide 
confidence intervals. 
Serious cardiovascular outcomes in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events are 
considered as important potential risk, together with serious hypersensitivity, hypertension during 
pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. The Applicant is proposing to conduct a Category 3 post-authorisation 
observational study as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. The primary objective of the study is to 
understand the utilization of galcanezumab and to characterize the incidence of cardiovascular events, 
malignancy, and serious hypersensitivity in real-world clinical practice. The proposed PASS has been split 
into 2 similar studies based on region (US and Europe). The applicant has submitted the proposed 
synopses as requested. However, the PASS synopsis for the European study should include the objective 
to conduct comparative analyses with new users of comparator medications, similar to the US study. Long

term data are at present missing, so the implications of chronic CGRP inhibition in migraine patients is at 
present unknown.  
There is currently insufficient evidence to classify increased hepatic enzymes, hearing loss, impaired ulcer 
and wound healing and peripheral vascular disease  as ADRs associated with galcanezumab treatment but 
these events will be further monitored in future PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Superiority of Galcanezumab compared to placebo in decreasing the burden of migraine episodes and 
symptoms in both EM and CM patients is considered demonstrated. The reduction of migraine headache 
days (MHD) and the proportion of patients with 50% reduced number of MHD are important and clinically 
relevant endpoints for both episodic and chronic migraine. In addition, the 30% responder endpoint is 
considered as relevant and clinically important endpoint for patients with chronic endpoints. However, the 
magnitude of treatment effect appears limited, especially in CM, and the possibility to up-titrate the 
recommend dose of 120 mg/day to 240 mg/day in the case of absence of response to the 120 mg dose 
should be left to the clinicians’ judgement. The discussion on possible criteria for the definition of 
“non-responder” to the 120 mg dose has been defined within three months from initiation of treatment 
and introduced into the SmPC 4.2. When looking at the decrease in monthly moderate to severe MHDs, 
the magnitude of treatment effect is reduced compared to the primary endpoint. Furthermore, when the 
severity of remaining migraine days is taken into consideration, no difference with placebo is observed in 
CHMP assessment report

the episodic migraine trial CGAG whereas a very small difference of questionable clinical relevance is 
apparent in the chronic migraine trial and episodic migraine trial CGAH.  Reduction of acute medications, 
could be considered a clinically relevant additional benefit, however this is at present not demonstrated. 
It is not possible to infer from the data provided that treatment effect induces a statistically significant 
reduction in acute medication use, because the change in MHDs with acute medication is considered 
irrespective of the corresponding monthly total number of migraine days. Indeed, looking at the percent 
change in the mean use of paracetamol and triptans from baseline, to the DB period in the 3 pivotal 
studies, there seems to be a small decrease in the 3 studies for galcanezumab when looking at acute 
treatment overall that reaches statistical significance in 2 studies (CGAH and CGAI for both doses). For 
the specific acute medication of triptans, paracetamol and NSAIDS, there were overall small reduction 
seen for galcanezumab treatment with only small increases for paracetamol in study CGAG at 240 mg 
galcanezumab dose and study CGAH at 120 mg galcanezumab dose. It is also not clear if in patients with 
CM, the addition of galcanezumab to either topiramate or propranolol, which are common drugs used in 
prophylaxis and which, as per the claimed indication, could well be combined with galcanezumab, adds 
any additional benefit or only exposes patients to a high risk of adverse events.  Available data are limited 
to patients with at least 4 MHDs per month, hence the indication has been changed to reflect this, whereas 
patients older than 65 years old could be treated after extrapolating efficacy from younger patients. In 
addition, methodological concerns in the conduct of the pivotal studies with regard to protocol deviations 
were alleviated by three sets of sensitivity analyses which showed consistent efficacy results.  
The safety profile of galcanezumab is manageable, with few discontinuations due to AEs registered in the 
clinical trials, although no information is at present available in patient older than 65 years old. However, 
due to the mechanism of action there is the potential risk of cardiovascular toxicity that may be 
exaggerated in migraine patients who are at higher risk of cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, patients 
at high cardiovascular risk were excluded from the clinical trials, and thus no conclusion can be drawn on 
this issue. The same holds true for the potential for drug-induced hypertension during pregnancy that 
may be derived by the attenuation of the vasodilatative action of CGRP.  
Long-term safety is largely unknown and given that the claimed indication is for a chronic disease, this is 
also considered important missing information, limiting the favourable effects of galcanezumab in the 
claimed indication. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of galcanezumab treatment in the claimed indication is currently considered to outweigh the 
risks.  The claimed indication is in line with the patient population recruited in the pivotal studies, however 
the magnitude of treatment effect appears limited, especially in CM. Despite the potential cardiovascular 
risk and the missing information on long term safety, galcanezumab was generally well tolerated.  An 
increase in the incidence of injection site reactions, constipation, vertigo and hypersensitivity TEAEs was 
observed in the 3 to 6 months-controlled studies compared to placebo. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Emgality is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Emgality is favourable in the following indication: 
Emgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per 
month. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that galcanezumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European

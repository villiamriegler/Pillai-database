conducted to address the post-approval 
commitment: to compare the pharmacokinetic profile 
of the oral suspension versus the tablets.

adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly patients 
were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration 
of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged ≥ 65 years). The data 
shows that the incidence of treatment emergent adverse 
events in this population (65.3 %) is similar to the general 
population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies 
(66.8%).The most frequent individual treatment emergent 
adverse events were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), 
somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, convulsion and hyponatraemia 
(8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72

spontaneous reports as well as the scientific literature, the 
CHMP concluded that there were no changes to the known 
benefits and safety concerns associated with Zebinix when 
used in the approved indication. The CHMP therefore 
concluded that the benefit/risk balance of Zebinix as 
adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures with 
or without secondary generalisation remained favourable 
and recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation. At the 
time of the approval, the CHMP requested the MAH to 
investigate the possible drug-drug interaction with 
carbamazepine as a follow-up measure. In addition, the 
CHMP requested the investigation of the inducing effect of 
eslicarbazepine acetate on CYP3A4 in humans as a follow-
up measure.  
In a drug-drug interaction study with carbamazepine, it 
was shown that concomitant administration of 
eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 
carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average 
decrease of approximately 30 % in exposure to the active 
metabolite eslicarbazepine most likely caused by an 
increase in metabolism. The dose of eslicarbazepine acetate 
may therefore need to be increased when used 
concomitantly with carbamazepine. Concomitant intake of 
eslicarbazepine acetate did not alter the pharmacokinetic 
profile of carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-
epoxide.

eslicarbazepine acetate showed an average decrease of 
approximately 50 % in systemic exposure to simvastatin 
when co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg 
once daily. An increase of the simvastatin dose may 
therefore be required when used concomitantly with 
eslicarbazepine acetate.  
Section 4.5 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL have been 
updated with the new information, and the PI has been 
revised according to the current QRD template.

Sections 4.3 of the SmPC was therefore updated to add two 
contraindications (concomitant use with ivabradine and 
venetoclax). Additionally, drug-drug interaction information 
between voriconazole and ivabradine and venetoclax was 
added to the Interactions in section 4.5. The Package

In addition, the MAH is taking the opportunity of this 
variation to update the SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.5 to 
clarify the wording regarding the contraindication of 
voriconazole with efavirenz. Also, as requested by 
the CHMP, the MAH takes the opportunity to clarify 
the paediatric dosing text in SmPC Section 4.2. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

hyponatremia and update of MAH’s Core Data Sheet , the 
MAH proposes in this variation application to update the 
Vfend SmPC section 4.8 with addition of the adverse drug 
reaction Hyponatremia. 
Considering the temporal relation consistent with the 
voriconazole treatment in the 3 reported cases, the 
absence of confounding medications, the positive 
dechallenge in 2 cases and also considering that adrenal 
insufficiency, a listed Vfend ADR, may induce 
hyponatremia, the CHMP acknowledges that there is a 
reasonable possibility that this event is caused by 
voriconazole and agrees to add hyponatremia in the SmPC 
section 4.8, with the frequency uncommon. The Package 
leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In addition, the wording of SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.5 
regarding the contraindication of voriconazole with 
efavirenz was clarified, as well as the paediatric dosing text 
in Section 4.2. 
The addition of the adverse event hyponatremia to the list 
of undesirable effects does not affect the benefit/risk of 
Vfend.

opportunity of this variation to correct the German 
translation of the PL instructions for use of the Vfend 
powder and solvent kit. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
between the use of voriconazole and squamous cell 
carcinoma remain unclear. Squamous cell carcinoma 
following the use of voriconazole is atypical in behaviour, 
possibly due to the immunological response in the presence 
of immune suppression.  
Photosensitivity reactions, whether drug-induced or purely 
the result of environmental factors, can contribute to the 
cumulative effects of photo-ageing and possibly skin 
cancers especially in the presence of immunosuppressed 
conditions. However, review of currently available 
information reported to MAH’s safety database does not 
provide sufficient evidence of a direct causal association 
between photo-ageing and SCC to treatment with 
voriconazole. As discussed, only 30 children and younger 
adults developed photo-ageing, only 6 of which reported 
SCC. All the patients reporting these events were either 
immunosuppressed or had conditions suggesting an 
immune-compromised status. The MAH will monitor these 
events closely and will re-evaluate its position as new 
information becomes available. 
It is known that voriconazole can cause phototoxicity and, 
in the view of these cumulative review data, a higher 
reporting rate of phototoxicity reported in children 
compared to adults was reported. It was agreed that this 
should be reflected in the Vfend Product Information.  
The CHMP noted the on-going non-clinical investigational 
studies lead by an independent research team and review 
the preliminary in vitro data. It recognised that the MAH 
does not own the control of these studies and the resulting 
data, and noted the willingness of the MAH to provide the 
results to the CHMP once available. 
Page 27/53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the review of the current and available body of 
evidence (signals, spontaneous reports, non-clinical and 
clinical study data) regarding the phototoxicity and 
voriconazole, including the risk of squamous cell carcinoma, 
the CHMP agreed that a causal relationship between 
voriconazole and SCC is possible to exist and therefore that 
this adverse reaction should be listed in the section 4.8 of 
the Vfend SmPC.  
The CHMP also agreed that the special warnings and 
precautions for use of Vfend should be updated with 
reinforcement of the recommendations for sunscreen (high 
sun protection factor) protection, especially in children, as 
well as a systematic and regular dermatologic evaluation 
whenever phototoxicity-related lesions occur and 
discontinuation of Vfend if premalignant skin lesions or SCC 
are identified. 
The CHMP agreed in principle with the RMP measures 
relating to the SCC safety concern, including Patient Alert 
Card, HCP check list and Q&A. Readjustment of the 
messages could be dealt with at national level. 
Considering the Risk Management Measures put in place 
and the updated Product Information, the CHMP was of the 
opinion that the risk benefit balance of Vfend remains 
positive.

the SmPC in order to inform prescribers of the limited 
safety data in patients with abnormal liver function tests 
and re-define the monitoring of hepatic function. The 
update describes in more details the liver function tests 
monitoring to be performed for patients receiving Vfend 
and indicates that the period of treatment should be as 
short as possible. The CHMP agreed that these updates are 
an improvement and adequately address the safety 
concerns on hepatotoxicity. The benefit/risk balance of 
Vfend is not affected by these updates.

in the section 4.8 Undesirable effects. The PL was updated 
accordingly. 
The new identified risk of periostitis does not affect 
adversely the benefit/risk balance of Vfend. Periositis,

MAH submitted information about paediatric studies, 
including two pharmacokinetic studies (one children aged 2 
to <12 years and one in children aged 12 to < 17 years). 
These data were then completed by an integrated 
population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data from 5 
studies. The assessment of these pharmacokinetic 
paediatric data suggested that the current SmPC paediatric 
dosing information could be optimised to achieve a better 
exposure comparable to that in adults. Based on these 
results and conclusions, it appeared that – in children 
between 2 and <12 years and in young adolescents (12 to 
14 years and < 50kg) - a dose of 9 mg/kg q12h at day 1, 
followed by an i.v. maintenance dose of 8 mg/kg i.v. q12h 
or a maintenance oral dose 9 mg/kg q12h would result in a 
comparable exposure to that in adults receiving a loading 
dose of 6 mg/kg, an iv maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg i.v. 
q12h or a maintenance oral dose 200 mg/kg q12h. In 
addition, analyses show that Vfend use in all adolescents 
between 12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg and 15 to 16 years 
regardless of body weight of age should be dosed as adults. 
The Vfend Product Information was updated to reflect these 
optimised paediatric dosing information and the studies 
results. The CHMP endorsed these updates.

information pertaining to the co-administration of 
voriconazole and alfentanil based on relevant 
literature data. The MAH also took the opportunity of 
this variation to update sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 
4.5 of the SPC with information regarding dose 
adjustment for efavirenz and voriconazole when co-
administration is deemed necessary in line with 
recommendations agreed by the CHMP in May 2007 
is extensively metabolised, mainly by hepatic cytochrome 
(CYP) P450 3A enzymes. Voriconazole is metabolized by 
and is also an inhibitor of the CYP P450 isozymes, CYP3A4, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2C9. Therefore, there is a theoretical 
concern that concomitantly administered alfentanil and 
CYP3A inhibitors may exhibit clinically important drug 
interactions. Within the dossier submitted to support this 
Type II variation II/54, the MAH submitted data on the

pharmacokinetics of oral voriconazole and alfentanil from a 
randomised, controlled, open-label, 3-way crossover clinical 
study of 12 healthy subjects published in the literature 
(Saari et al. 2006). The data from Saari et al. show that co-
administration of voriconazole markedly inhibits the 
metabolism of alfentanil. Although the study only 
investigated alfentanil, other data show that clinically 
relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between voriconazole 
and fentanyl can occur. Therefore physicians are now 
warned in section 4.4 of Vfend SPC of the co-administration 
of voriconazole with other short acting opiates similar in 
structure to alfentanil and metabolised by CYP3A4, such as 
fentanil and sufentanil.

also be warned in the SPC that voriconazole levels will be 
more variable when co-administered with cyclic oral 
contraceptives due to the pill-free week. Furthermore, 
despite no increase of the incidence of hormonal related 
adverse events was observed in this study, it can not be 
excluded that, due to the concomitant use, higher estrogen

and 28%, respectively, indicating that enzyme induction 
had occurred after the introduction of ritonavir. Low dose 
ritonavir had a less marked effect on voriconazole 
pharmacokinetics than previously seen with higher doses of 
ritonavir (400 mg q 12 hr). Therefore the current strict 
contraindication for concomitant use of voriconazole and 
high doses of ritonavir is not warranted for low "booster" 
doses of ritonavir and the section 4.4 "Special warnings and 
special precautions for use" of Vfend SPC was updated with 
the relative contraindication for the use of low doses 
ritonavir in voriconazole treatment  ("Coadministration of 
voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100mg twice daily) 
should be avoided unless an assessment of the benefit/risk 
justifies the use of voriconazole."). The section 4.5 
"Interaction with other medicinal product and other forms

"Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms 
of interaction" further to results from a clinical study 
conducted to assess the effects of voriconazole on the 
pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety of methadone co-
administered at a steady state in methadone patients. 
The results showed that in subjects receiving a methadone 
maintenance dose (32-100mg once daily), coadministration 
of oral voriconazole (400mg twice daily for 1 day, then 
200mg twice daily for four days) increased the Cmax and 
AUCt of pharmacologically active R-methadone by 31% and 
47%, respectively, whereas the Cmax and AUCt of the S-
enantiomer increased by approximately 65% and 103%, 
respectively. Comparison with historical data showed that  
voriconazole plasma concentrations during coadministration 
of methadone were comparable to voriconazole levels in 
healthy subjects without any comedication.  
The mean QTc interval was similar in both the Methadone + 
Placebo and Methadone + Voriconazole groups. It might 
therefore be concluded that administration of the standard 
therapeutic voriconazole doses did not lead to serious QTc 
prolongation in patients treated with methadone dosages of 
32-100 mg. Furthermore, relevant QTc prolongation is not 
expected at regular voriconazole dosages of 200 mg. 
Page 48/53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, it should be noticed that the power of this study 
is very low and sensitivity can be doubted, hence frequent 
monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to 
increased plasma concentrations of methadone, including 
QT prolongation, is recommended during coadministration. 
Dose reduction of methadone may be needed.

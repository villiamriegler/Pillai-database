marketing authorisation and the following variation(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension application to add a new strength of 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with safety 
system (PFS-S) and pre-filled pen (PFP), grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to add the following 
indications: 
- Add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older, who 
are inadequately controlled with medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal 
product for maintenance treatment, including those with or without an eosinophilic phenotype; 
- Maintenance therapy to improve lung function; 
- Maintenance therapy to reduce oral steroid use and improve lung function in steroid-dependent asthma 
patients; 
based on the pivotal studies DRI12544, QUEST and VENTURE. 
As a consequence, SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated and the Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
The RMP (version 2.0) is updated accordingly.  
In addition to the above changes in the approved 300 mg SmPC, a new SmPC for the 200 mg strength was 
submitted for the asthma population that would be eligible for this dose. 
In addition, the MAH proposed to merge the SmPCs for the 200 mg and 300 mg strengths. This request was 
not approved by CHMP. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0021/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on partial compliance for the PIP P/0021/2017. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway hyper responsiveness, acute 
and chronic bronchoconstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging. The inflammatory component of 
asthma involves many cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial 
cells and their biological products. 
The poor response of some patients with asthma to the standard regimen of controller and reliever therapies 
may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. Recent therapeutic 
approaches in asthma have been focused on trying to control the Type 2/ T-helper cell-2 (Th2) response. Up-
regulation of the Th2 cell-derived cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been 
implicated as an important inflammatory component of asthma disease progression. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease affecting approximately 334 million people world-wide. 
Between 35% and 50% of asthma expenditures are consequences of exacerbations and hospitalizations, 
emergency department and unscheduled clinic visits comprise the majority of exacerbation-related treatment 
costs. Approximately 5 to 10% of the total asthma population has severe asthma. Nearly 25% of patients 
with severe asthma have had a near fatal asthma attack.  
Recurrent exacerbations are thought to be associated with an increased risk of permanent damage to the 
lung tissue and lead to a progressive decline in lung function. Patients with asthma, especially those with 
more severe, persistent disease, are at risk of an excessive decline in lung function in adulthood. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 8/161 
 
 
  
  
  
2.1.2.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Complex inflammatory pathways in the airway underlie disease pathobiology of uncontrolled asthma. In the 
majority of cases this inflammatory process is driven by Type 2 inflammation characterized by the release of 
signature cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) via both the innate 
and adaptive immune pathways. Typically, individuals with Type 2 high asthma present with airway 
eosinophilia (with or without blood eosinophilia), elevated levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), 
increased numbers of airway mast cells, increased levels of serum periostin. It has been demonstrated that 
the elevations in Type 2 driven inflammation play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. 
IL-4 is a central mediator of T lymphocyte cell differentiation; it induces the production of Type 2 associated 
cytokines and chemokines (IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine [TARC/CCL17] and 
eotaxins-3), isotype class switching of B cells to produce serum IgE, and the recruitment of eosinophils and 
other inflammatory cells (including tissue eosinophils). Although IL-13 displays some redundancies in these 
pro-inflammatory processes, it has additional roles in mediating goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus production, 
smooth muscle contractility, and airway hyper responsiveness. Together, IL-4 and IL-13 play critical roles in 
the induction and effector phases of asthma. Biomarkers of Type 2 inflammation include blood 
and sputum eosinophils, FeNO, serum IgE, serum periostin, TARC/CCL17, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), 
eotaxin-3 and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)/CCL18. 
While IL-4 and IL-13 have overlapping pleotropic actions, IL-4 tends to predominate in modulating immune 
cell functions whereas IL-13 predominates in stimulation of tissues. IL-4 is a major mediator of the 
polarization of T helper cells toward the Th2 phenotype, ie, cells that secrete more exclusively IL-4, IL-5 and 
IL-13 and their proliferation. Th2 cytokines have a central role in stimulating secretion of chemotaxins that 
promote homing of Th2 cells, eosinophils and mast cells into the respiratory epithelium. Surface 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors on mast cells and eosinophils facilitate release of stored pro-inflammatory 
mediators from these cells through both allergen-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Under conditions 
of asthmatic inflammation, IL-4 and IL-13 prime mast cells, enhancing their responsiveness, in part by up-
regulating surface receptors for IgE, and inducing the production and storage of cytokines, including IL-4 and 
IL-13. Th2 asthma is often associated with elevation in serum IgE and allergen sensitization (ie, atopy). IL-4 
is recognized as the principle promoter of IgE class switching in B cells and is thus central to elevation in IgE 
and the sensitization of cells expressing IgE receptors. The various mediators released by these sensitized 
cells during exposure to allergens are major contributors to airway hyper responsiveness and disease 
exacerbation. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation with edema, cellular infiltrations and mucus plugging, 
variable airway obstruction and bronchial hyper responsiveness in response to various triggers. Typical 
symptoms of asthma are wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough, especially nocturnal. 
Asthma is increasingly recognized as heterogeneous disease and not all patients may respond similarly to 
current therapies or have the same clinical course. While current treatment options are fairly satisfactory for 
patients with milder disease, they are insufficient for 50% of asthma patients with moderate-to-severe 
uncontrolled disease. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is a strong predictor of asthma 
exacerbations and progressive lung function decline, independent of symptom levels, especially if FEV1 is 
<60% predicted. FEV1 is a powerful predictor of general, pulmonary, and cardiovascular mortality. Research 
indicates that asthma itself and the use of asthma medications may be independently associated with 
increased cardiovascular risk. Studies of patients with asthma selected from the general population have 
shown increased all-cause mortality due to pulmonary cause, especially in patients with reduced lung 
function. These findings underscore the importance of preserving normal lung function in the management of 
asthma. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 9/161 
 
 
  
  
  
2.1.4.  Management 
As defined by asthma treatment guidelines, the goals of therapy are twofold: reduction in impairment and 
reduction in risk. Reduction in impairment is defined by reduction in frequency and intensity of asthma 
symptoms, improvement in lung function, reduction in short acting beta agonist use. Reduction in risk 
includes prevention of acute recurrent exacerbations, prevention of loss of lung growth in children and loss of 
lung function in adults, and the optimization of pharmacotherapy to allow for minimal or limited adverse 
effects associated with treatment regimens. Although existing therapies are able to control symptoms and 
improve reversible airway obstruction in mild asthma, approximately 50% of patients with asthma have 
moderate-to-severe uncontrolled disease with 5% to 10% considered to have severe uncontrolled disease 
despite use of currently available therapies. These latter patients are at the highest risks of the morbidity and 
mortality associated with asthma. However, patients with moderate-to-severe disease have significant 
impairment to quality of life and contribute to the substantial healthcare costs for this disease. 
As stated above, the long-term goals of asthma treatment are to achieve good symptom control, minimize 
future risk of exacerbations and to improve lung function, including preventing progression to a fixed airway 
obstruction while minimizing the risk of side effects associated with treatments (long-term, high dose ICS 
and chronic use of oral corticosteroids [OCS]).  
There are three main categories of asthma medications: 
• Reliever (rescue) medications: these provide as-needed immediate relief of symptoms related to 
bronchospasm which occurs in the setting of poorly controlled asthma or secondary to an allergen, microbe 
or pollutant. These are mostly short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs). 
• Controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids combined with a long acting β2-
agonists (LABAs), and leukotrienes): these are used for regular maintenance treatment. They reduce airway 
inflammation, control symptoms and reduce future exacerbation risks. 
• Add-on therapies: these are considered when symptoms persist despite treatment with inhaled controller 
medication. This category includes:  
- Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) (eg, tiotropium), and methyl-xanthines (eg, theophylline) 
- Chronic OCS therapy, used in the most severe patients who cannot achieve asthma control with standard-
of-care 
- Biologic treatments. These currently include 2 classes of drugs: 
- anti-IgE (omalizumab) 
- anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): mepolizumab, reslizumab, and anti-IL-5 receptor alpha mAb 
benralizumab. 
Unmet medical need 
For patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma, combination inhalers delivering inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) are the current standard of care recommended by 
asthma guidelines, and additional controller medications (leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA], 
theophylline, etc.) may be used. However, if patients remain uncontrolled on ICS, further dose increases 
provide little incremental benefit. Many severe patients with uncontrolled symptoms have significant Type 2 
inflammation. Therapeutic options for these patients are limited and often require frequent or maintenance 
use of oral corticosteroids. Chronic use of oral corticosteroids leads to well-recognized and significant 
complications which may include increased risk of glaucoma, cataract, diabetes, osteoporosis, susceptibility 
to infections, obesity, avascular necrosis, stroke, hypertension, sleep disturbances, mood swings and weight 
gain. Long-term use of ICS treatment, especially high-dose, is also associated with adverse events: in 
adolescents, adrenal suppression and growth retardation has been observed; while in adults, increased 
incidence of glaucoma, cataract and bone density loss has been reported.  
There is a recognized ceiling effect for what can be achieved with ICS/LABA combinations. It has been shown 
that if patients remain uncontrolled on medium doses of ICS, further dose increases provide little incremental 
benefit. For patients with uncontrolled asthma, ICSs often fail to normalize elevated Type 2 biomarkers in

blood, exhaled air and/or induced sputum, indicating persistence of significant residual Type 2 inflammation. 
The role of ICS in altering the airway remodeling and the natural course of asthma has not been well 
established; some studies demonstrated benefits with early intervention whereas others failed to show any 
benefit on lung function changes over time. Combination of ICS +LABA shows some improvement on FEV1 
due to their bronchodilator effect. The add-on benefit of LABA to ICS, however, provides an additional 
reduction of exacerbations (on the order of a 20% to 25% reduction in severe exacerbations. Leukotriene 
receptor antagonists (LTRA) are less effective than ICS and may be appropriate for some patients who are 
unable or unwilling to use ICS or experience intolerable side-effects from ICS. LAMA add-on may have 
additional benefits on lung function and asthma control over LABA/ICS; however, effects in reducing the need 
for rescue oral steroids and benefits on quality of life are inconsistent and negligible. 
About the product 
Mode of Action (MoA) 
Dupilumab (also referred to as SAR231893 and REGN668) is under development as a potential novel 
treatment for asthma. Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody that inhibits 
interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4Rα subunit shared 
by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both 
IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. IL-4 is the central mediator of TH naive T cells 
differentiating into Type-2 cytokine-producing effectors cells, growth of B cells and initiation of isotype class 
switching (especially to IgE). Although IL-13 has some redundancy in these pro-inflammatory processes, IL-
13 has additional roles in mediating goblet cell hyperplasia and smooth muscle contractility. IL-4 and IL-13 
maintain immune polarization towards a Type-2 response. Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and 
IL-13 cytokine-induced responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE. 
As a selective immunomodulator targeting Type 2 inflammation, dupilumab has been approved for the 
treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in the United States (US) and the European Union 
(EU). 
Regulatory Histor 
At time of submission, dupilumab is approved in the US, Canada and EU for the treatment of adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and is under review by a number of other health authorities 
for the AD indication. Dupilumab has not been approved for the asthma indication by any regulatory agency 
to date. 
Dupilumab is currently in development for the treatment of Nasal Polyposis (Phase 3) and Eosinophilic 
Esophagitis (Phase 2) in adults. Phase 3 pediatric studies in AD (from 6 to 11 years old, and from 12 to 17 
years old) and asthma (from 6 to 11 years old) are also ongoing. The proposed dupilumab asthma program 
and the pooling strategy for the evaluation of efficacy and safety was discussed and agreed with regulatory 
authorities.

needle-safety system) (PFS-S) or pre-filled  pen (PFP), with a fixed 27 gauge 12.7 mm (½ inch), thin wall 
stainless steel staked needle.  
The active substance dupilumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Dupixent is authorised in the EU for the treatment of atopic 
dermatitis with a dosage strength of 150 mg/mL dupilumab filled into a 2.25 mL single-use pre-filled syringe 
(PFS) to provide a deliverable volume of 2 mL (300 mg dose) and is available as 300 mg in a PFS and 300 
mg PFS with safety system (PFS-S). 
For the asthma indication an additional dosage of 200 mg is proposed which is the subject of this line 
extension application. 
The 200 mg dose is delivered using a 1 mL glass syringe that contains a volume of 1.14 mL compared to the 
300mg dose authorised product (2.25 mL). The reduced volume of administration of the 200 mg dose 
product (1.14 mL) compared to the 300mg dose authorised product (2.25 mL),  will be manufactured from a 
proposed additional strength of 175 mg/mL which comprises - besides the higher dupilumab concentration - 
a slightly different formulation compared with the authorised strength of 150 mg/mL.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the IL-4R alpha sub-
unit of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complex. Dupilumab has a predicted protein molecular weight of 
146,897.0 Da and contains a single, conserved N-glycosylation site (Asn302) in the Fc region of each heavy 
chain subunit. Dupilumab heavy chains contain a serine to proline mutation at amino acid 233, which is 
located in the hinge region of the Fc domain.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture of dupilumab active substance (AS) and formulated AS (FAS) is performed at Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Columbia Turnpike, USA.  Other sites for specified testing are described in the 
application. All sites are appropriately GMP-certified. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 12/161 
 
  
  
  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The new dosage/strength 200 mg (175 mg/mL x 1.14 mL) is made from the same active substance as the 
authorised dosage/strength 300 mg (150 mg/mL x 2 mL). Differences in the manufacturing processes that 
lead to the two different strengths start with formulation of AS into formulated AS (FAS). Besides the higher 
dupilumab concentration, the formulation of both strengths differs in arginine concentration.  
No changes to the authorised strength have been made in the context of the present extension. The 
dupilumab AS is not affected by the additional strength. New or revised documentation regarding the “active 
substance” sections of the CTD dossier pertain to FAS only, except for some editorial changes.  
The batch size is defined. FP derived from the commercial AS as well as from AS manufactured with an earlier 
process was used in pivotal clinical trials for both strengths- 150 and 175 mg/mL dupilumab. Regeneron 
currently maintains two manufacturing suites at the specified site. Both suites utilise equivalent or identical 
equipment. Commercial supply is planned to be manufactured in both process areas.  
The manufacture of dupilumab AS represents a standard manufacturing process for the manufacture of 
monoclonal antibodies. It is achieved in three main parts, the upstream process, which produces the 
antibody, the downstream process, which purifies the antibody and the formulation of the AS.  
Differences in the manufacturing processes of both strengths are specified and start with the formulation 
process from AS to FAS to obtain the higher concentration of the 175 mg/mL strength. The dupilumab 
formulation process for the 175 mg/mL allows for two slightly different processes at onset.  To prepare 175 
mg/mL FAS, the AS in the formulation bag is compounded to the desired concentration and formulation with 
the addition of a concentrated excipient buffer. While the dilution buffer composition is the same for both 
strengths, the excipient buffer composition for manufacture of 175 mg/mL FAS is different from that used for 
manufacture of 150 mg/mL FAS. Together with a different ratio of excipient buffer to adjust AS, this results 
in the commercial compositions of either 175 mg/mL or 150 mg/mL FAS differing in the concentration of 
active ingredient and arginine. This is then followed by filtration and mixing. The dupilumab FAS is then 
dispensed into specified bottles with caps and transferred to storage until shipment to FP filling site. 
Reprocessing is not claimed. There is no change to the AS and FAS container closure system with regard to 
the 175mg/mL strength. 
Samples are collected throughout the process for endotoxin, bioburden and CHO host cell proteins (HCP) and 
DNA. In-process controls are adequately set to control the process. The applicant has provided a description 
of the composition and preparation of all buffers and solutions listed in this section as well as 
chromatography/filter conditions.  
Control of materials 
No changes were made to CTD section S.2.3 Control of materials. The control of materials as authorised for 
150 mg/mL dupilumab also applies to 175 mg/mL dupilumab 
The dupilumab manufacturing process does not use raw materials of direct animal origin, other than Chinese 
hamster ovary cells.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
All AS and FAS manufacturing processes steps include controls within the in process controls (IPC) program 
for assurance of operational and performance consistency, as well as adherence to product safety 
requirements for each step. The in process controls (IPCs) and action limits or acceptance criteria of most 
process steps for the 150 mg/mL and 175 mg/mL FAS are identical. The IPC action limits which are different 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 13/161 
  
  
  
for 175 mg/mL have been defined in the dossier. All IPC action limits applicable for 175 mg/mL FAS are 
covered by process validation activities using 175 mg/mL batches.  
Process validation 
Process performance qualification (PPQ) studies, impurity clearance, hold times, limit of in vitro cell age 
(LIVCA), proven acceptable range (PAR) studies and resin life time validations of AS manufacturing remain 
applicable. The FAS manufacturing process has been successfully validated at the appropriate site for the 175 
mg/mL strength. Earlier and current commercial processes were validated using an appropriate number of 
lots. Upper and lower limits of operational and performance parameters were evaluated and acceptance 
criteria of IPCs were based on the validated ranges. The capability of the process to operate consistently with 
extended processing times for each unit operation was assessed as part of the process validation and the 
shortest times were set as validated holding times.  
The overall process validation confirmed that the formulation processes to manufacture the 175 mg/mL FAS 
are capable of operating in a consistent and robust manner. The validation and comparability activities 
demonstrated that the dupilumab formulation processes reproducibly produce 175 mg/mL FAS of consistent 
quality that meets the predetermined specifications. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial manufacturing process for the existing 150 and the new 175 mg/mL strength of dupilumab is 
identical to an earlier manufacturing process used to manufacture materials for the Phase 2b and pivotal 
Phase 3 clinical trials except for two specified changes: certain downstream purification steps.  
a) Introduction of an additional chromatography step  
b) Change to the virus-retentive filter. 
Extended characterisation of manufacturing processes has been performed for authorised 150 mg/mL 
dupilumab and was confirmed for 175 mg/mL.  
Comparability of 175 mg/mL dupilumab FAS produced from an earlier and the commercial A AS process was 
assessed by release, long term and accelerated stability testing and found acceptable during the 
authorisation of the existing formulation (150 mg/mL).  
Comparability of 175 mg/mL dupilumab FAS produced from an earlier and the commercial FAS process was 
assessed by release, long term and accelerated stability testing and found acceptable during the 
authorisation of the existing formulation (150 mg/mL). Dupilumab 175 mg/mL FAS obtained with the slightly 
different processes were also studied and from the stability comparison it can be concluded that both 175 
mg/mL FAS processes are comparable. 
Characterisation 
The characterisation of dupilumab structure and other characteristics as well as product- and process-related 
impurities has been demonstrated in an adequate and sufficient manner during MAA review of the authorised 
150 mg/mL dupilumab strength and can also be applied to the proposed 175 mg/mL strength. It was clarified 
that worst-case impurity calculations were performed using the maximum 300 mg dose and are applicable to 
the 200 mg dose. All stated impurities and their levels have therefore been qualified by clinical studies and 
are present in the authorised product.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 14/161 
 
  
  
  
Specification 
There is no change to the dupilumab AS release and end of shelf life specifications. The Duplimumab FAS 
specification includes appropriate physicochemical tests and tests for identity, potency and purity. Since the 
150 mg/mL and 175 mg/mL formulations of dupilumab share the same AS but have minor differences in the 
formulation and concentration of excipients, the acceptance criteria for most quality attributes are the same 
between both strengths for the FAS, with specified exceptions. 
The process used for setting and justification of specifications and acceptance criteria has been adequately 
described. In brief, clinically-qualified values were used where possible. The applicant also leveraged 
historical data from AS and FAS lots. Stability data were used to support end-of-shelf specifications.  
Analytical methods 
The same analytical procedures used for dupilumab release, stability, and IPC testing for AS and 150 mg/mL 
FAS are applicable to 175 mg/mL dupilumab.  
The potency assay is performed as an AS, FAS and bulk PFS release test. 
Validation data of analytical procedures were considered valid for 175 mg/mL dupilumab. Methods that 
required additional validation for 175 mg/mL dupilumab have been provided and are sufficiently described in 
the dossier.  
Batch analysis 
Dupilumab FAS include several formulations examined in clinical trials, as well as the commercial FAS 
composition. 
The batch release results of an appropriate number of lots manufactured with the commercial 175 mg/mL 
formulation complied with the specifications. The batch release results demonstrate that the commercial 
manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing 175 mg/mL FAS. 
Reference materials 
There is no change to the dupilumab reference standard (RS) program with regard to the 175 mg/mL 
strength.  
Stability 
A shelf life is already approved for dupilumab AS.  
A shelf life is proposed for the 175 mg/mL FAS.  
Dupilumab 175 mg/mL FAS stability studies have been carried out according to ICH recommended long term 
conditions and accelerated storage conditions. Stress stability studies have been conducted. Test articles are 
packaged in representative packaging. Appropriate stability indicating parameters have been tested. 
The representative real-time stability is based on an appropriate number of FAS batches produced with the 
commercial process. Supportive long-term stability studies of lots manufactured using the earlier AS process 
were also provided.  
All results from primary studies met the acceptance criteria at all available time points and no meaningful 
changes were observed in any batches, regardless of manufacturing process. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 15/161 
  
  
  
The applicant committed to complete the stability studies of the primary and supporting dupilumab 175 
mg/mL FAS batches at the long-term storage condition according to the stability protocols provided. Any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, will be reported to the Rapporteur and 
EMA. 
Accelerated, forced degradation and photo- stability studies confirm the degradation pathways for 175 
mg/mL dupilumab FAS as expected from 150 mg/mL dupilumab data.  
The stability results indicate that the 175 mg/mL dupilumab FAS is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed  container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The authorised 150 mg/mL dupilumab strength is supplied in PFS and PFS-S to deliver 2 mL resulting in a 
300 mg dose. Dupixent 175 mg/mL is supplied in two presentations: prefilled syringe with safety system 
(PFS-S) and pre-filled pen (PFP), both containing the same deliverable volume of 1.14 mL (200 mg dose of 
AS). Both, the PFS-S presentation and the PFP presentation, are comprised of a primary container referred to 
as a “bulk prefilled syringe (bulk PFS)”.  
Besides the different concentration and volume, there is a difference in the formulation regarding the 
175mg/mL strength, as compared to the 150 mg/mL.  
The composition of both 175 mg/mL presentations, PFS-S and PFP (200 mg dose) is the same.

There 
are no novel excipients used in the FP formulation. Dupilumab FP contains no excipients of human or animal 
origin. All excipients used in the manufacture of dupilumab FAS/FP are purchased as compendial grade 
(Ph.Eur.) excipients. There are no overages included in the formula. An overfill is required for the pre-filled 
syringes to ensure there is adequate volume in the syringe to provide the required dose.  
The primary container (bulk PFS) of both the PFS-S presentation and the PFP presentation consists of a 
siliconised glass syringe barrel with a staked, stainless steel 27 gauge, 1/2" needle, an elastomeric plunger 
stopper, and a needle shield.  The PFS-S presentation is comprised of the bulk PFS, plunger rod, finger flange 
and a safety device for sharps injury prevention.  
The PFP presentation is comprised of the bulk PFS which is assembled with the device subassemblies to form 
the finished dupilumab 1 mL PFP. It is a button-less, needle cover-triggered (“push-click”), single-dose 
drug/device combination product. The device possesses a passive needle-shielding safety mechanism to 
protect the patient from needle stick injuries after use of the device. The term PFP is considered to be 
synonymous to and may be used interchangeably with the term “auto-injector” (AI).  
The medicinal product and the administration device for both, the PFS-S and PFP respectively, form a single 
integral unit. The device does not have a CE mark. The device components meet the relevant essential 
requirements of the Annex 1 of Regulation 2017/745/EC and Annex 1 of the medical device directive 
93/42/EEC, respectively. 
There were no process changes between clinical and commercial process except for batch size and the needle 
shield which are without impact on the product. 
There is no difference in the formulations of phase 3 clinical and commercial presentations of 175 mg/mL 
dupilumab. However, phase 3 clinical trial material was manufactured from FAS derived either from the AS 
manufactured using the earlier or the commercial process. The change to the commercial process was 
already approved during the MAA for the existing strength.  
Proven acceptable range studies demonstrate the robustness of the 175 mg/mL dupilumab formulation. 
Process parameters of the commercial 175 mg/mL manufacturing process were optimised and defined during 
development.  
Extractable and leachable studies have been carried out on material which comes into contact with the FP 
during manufacture and storage. Data has been presented to show that the FP is compatible with the chosen 
container closure systems.  
The process validation report for PFP assembly summarises the results of in-process control testing, quality 
control testing, and time-out-of-refrigeration (TOR) monitoring. All commercial specifications proposed for 
the bulk PFS and the PFP-related test items were met. The global TOR for PFP was validated. Successful 
process validation demonstrated that the PFP manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing a 
product that meets the pre-defined acceptance criteria.  
PFP performance was evaluated according to ISO standards. The functionality of the PFP was discussed with 
regard to the strong discrepancy in the bioequivalence between PFS-S and PFP observed in clinical PK 
studies. This was questioned as part of a multidisciplinary major objection during the procedure (see 
discussion section for more details).  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 17/161 
 
 
  
  
  
As part of the microbial attributes, sterility and endotoxin testing are monitored during batch release testing. 
The results of the container closure integrity tests demonstrate that the container closure system maintains 
the sterility of the product and that manufacturing operations and shipping do not impact the container 
closure integrity.  
The results of the simulated shipping validation were satisfactory, with all acceptance criteria proposed for 
commercial product met. The packaging is able to protect the product from adverse conditions encountered 
during transport. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
No new GMP documentation is considered necessary for the 200 mg PFS-S. Appropriate GMP documentation 
for PFP was provided.  AS, FAS and FP manufacturing sites are specified for the PFS-S and PFP.  
The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and involves thawing of FAS, pooling, mixing and 
sterile filtration, filling into syringes, which are then fitted with a stopper. The applicant clarified that syringes 
and plunger stoppers sterilisation cycles are Ph. Eur. compliant. The final PFS-S is assembled by inserting a 
plunger rod and attaching a finger flange and safety device for sharps injury prevention. 
The manufacturing process of 200 mg DP is generally the same as for 300 mg DP. The in-process controls 
are, in general, the same. 
The manufacturing processes and process controls described can be considered suitable for manufacturing of 
bulk PFS and PFS-S of sufficient quality as well as the process described for PFP manufacturing.  
The batch size range is covered by the process validation batches.  
Process validation of 175 mg/mL bulk PFS, PFS-S and PFP manufacturing were performed using an 
appropriate number of batches (from the commercial AS process). Overall the validated processes can 
generally be considered adequate to reproducibly produce FP within the defined process parameters. The 
manufacturing process simulation with media fill testing demonstrated the efficacy of the aseptic filling 
process. Simulated shipping validation demonstrated that product quality confirmed the absence of transport 
impact.  
Product specification 
FP specifications are provided. The acceptance criteria for most quality attributes are the same as currently 
authorised. 
The release specifications for the PFS-S and PFP also contain a complete list of release tests and acceptance 
criteria covering product solution properties, identity, strength, purity, potency and functional performance 
properties specific for PFS-S and PFP, respectively.  
In general the chosen release tests are sufficient to ensure the quality of the FP and are sufficiently in line 
with ICH Q6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on monoclonal antibodies for human use.  
The end-of-shelf-life specification for the dupilumab FP in PFS-S/PFP contains a complete list of stability tests 
and acceptance criteria covering product, strength, purity, potency and functional performance properties.

The product related impurities are the same for the FP as for the AS, i.e. high molecular weight species, low 
molecular weight species, charge variants and oxidised species. Appropriate specifications are in place for the 
FP to control these product-related impurities. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods are fully validated. Non-compendial methods have been validated in line with ICH 
guidance.  
Batch analysis 
Representative-scale batch data has been provided for several batches of bulk PFS and PFS-S. Furthermore, 
batch release data of a suitable number of PFP batches have been provided. 
All batch analyses results of 175 mg/mL bulk PFS, PFS-S and PFP batches complied with the commercial 
release specifications.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard is the same as that used for AS. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for bulk PFS, PFS-S and PFP is 18 months at 2 – 8°C.  
Stability studies examining 175 mg/mL dupilumab bulk PFS, PFS-S and PFP have been executed according to 
ICH recommended long-term conditions (at 2-8°C for up to 36 months) and accelerated storage conditions 
(at 23-27°C for up to 6 months). Stress stability studies are conducted at 42-48°C (for up to 3 months). 
Regarding the PFS bulk, the representative real-time stability is based on a suitable number of  primary 175 
mg/mL bulk PFS batches produced with the commercial process. Supportive 175 mg/mL bulk PFS data are 
available from confirmatory batches which were derived from AS manufactured by the earlier process.  
The real-time stability bulk PFS commercial batches showed excellent dupilumab protein stability at the long-
term storage condition, with little to no change in any attributes up to the latest time point tested.  
Accelerated stability data are available for all lots. The trends observed were as expected from experience 
with 150 mg/mL dupilumab. The shelf life claim of 18-months for the 200 mg PFP based on available 
commercial bulk PFS stability data is acceptable.  
Regarding 175 mg/mL PFS-S and PFP, real-time stability results were provided for an appropriate number of 
batches (from the commercial process). PFS-S and PFP specific parameters tested beyond those of bulk PFS 
parameters perform satisfactorily up to the latest time-point tested so far. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
Data have been provided supporting the SmPC statement “If necessary, pre-filled syringes or pre-filled pens 
may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C for a maximum of 14 days. Do not store above 25°C. If the 
carton needs to be removed permanently from refrigerator, the date of removal may be recorded on the 
outer carton. After removal from the refrigerator, Dupixent must be used within 14 days or discarded.”

Overall the proposed shelf life of 18 months is acceptable. Based on the stability results, the proposed 
concurrent shelf life of 18 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C for dupilumab PFS-S and PFP are also accepted as 
the assembly process does not affect stability 
Adventitious agents 
The same AS is used for the manufacture of the proposed new strengths 175 mg/mL as has been used for 
the authorised strengths 150 mg/mL and the FP does not introduce any new risks with respect to 
adventitious agents. Dupilumab is expressed in CHO cells manufactured without the direct use of animal-
derived raw materials (ADM). The indirect use of animal-derived raw materials is limited and confined to 
usage of ADMs during cell line development which have been clearly documented. The company has in place 
a suitable strategy to minimise risk from potential adventitious agents which involves: 
The controlled sourcing and safety of the raw materials (including the cell banks) used during cell line 
development and in the manufacturing process (safety of raw materials) 
The suitability of the approaches used to test and eliminate potential risks during the manufacturing process 
(in-process adventitious agent testing) 
The effectiveness and robustness of the viral inactivation and removal during the product purification process 
(viral clearance). 
The adventitious agents documentation is identical to that approved for the currently authorised Dupixent 
300 mg strength. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Manufacture 
The new strength 175 mg/mL is made from the same AS as the authorised strength 150 mg/mL. Differences 
in the manufacturing processes that lead to the two different strengths start with formulation of AS into 
formulated AS (FAS). Besides the higher dupilumab concentration, the formulation of both strengths differs in 
arginine concentration. In general, the manufacturing processes of FAS and FP were adequately described. All 
IPC action limits applicable for 175 mg/mL FAS are covered by process validation activities using 175 mg/mL 
batches. 
Pharmaceutical development and process validation of PFP 
A significant discrepancy in the bioequivalence between PFS-S and PFP was observed in clinical PK studies 
and was raised as part of a multidisciplinary major objection during the procedure. In this regard the 
functionality of the PFP was extensively discussed. 
In relationship to this, further questions were raised during the procedure to establish whether the 
functionality of the PFP could be responsible for the discrepancy in the bioequivalence between PFS-S and PFP 
observed in clinical PK studies. Data were provided to show that the PFP assembly process can be regarded 
as successfully validated. All commercial specifications proposed for the bulk PFS and the PFP-related test 
items were met.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 20/161 
 
 
  
  
  
PFP device performance was evaluated according to ISO standards. The dose accuracy requirements of ISO 
11608-1 were met by dupilumab 1 mL PFP for all investigated test conditions. Dupilumab 1 mL PFP complied 
with performance parameter testing and the pre-defined acceptance criteria which correspond to those of the 
respective functional PFP release specifications. Accelerated ageing of the device-constituent parts of the PFP 
did not have an influence on the functionality of the PFP.  
The primary container closure system (bulk PFS) that comes into direct contact with the FP is the same for 
PFS-S and PFP. Particularly, there is no difference in the needle of the bulk PFS. Factors that might lead to 
differences in the application of the dose, e.g. the injection depth with PFS-S vs. PFP and the instructions for 
use of PFS-S (45° injection) and PFP (90° injection) were discussed by the MAH. The results of a study 
demonstrated that the volume delivered from all 200 mg dupilumab FP is equivalent as measured in the 
respective release tests. 
It is stated that there was no expected usability-related issue in the pre-clinical human factors validation 
studies and in the clinical trial (R668-AD-1607) that could lead to a difference in dupilumab exposure. A 
sample of PFPs were returned for evaluation after use in the bridging study. All PFPs were found to have 
functioned as intended and in accordance with their design. A visual assessment of plunger stopper position 
at the needle end of the syringe demonstrated that the syringe was emptied completely and the full dose was 
delivered.  
The differences in the usability and performance of PFS/PFS-S on the one hand and PFP on the other hand 
were compared. Needle length and injection angle was investigated. PFP users are instructed to place the PFP 
on the skin at a 90° angle so that the needle cover touches the injection site. A slight underfill was observed 
in batch release of the clinical/PK PFP batch. A summary of the investigations related to the observer OOS 
result was provided. The investigation concluded that both filling and 100% visual inspection processes 
demonstrated the ability to reject syringes filled with less than the required amount. No drift in the 
manufacturing process was identified. It is agreed that considering the insignificance of the under-dose, this 
would not be the cause of the difference seen in PK in the clinical study. 
Following the human factors studies additional information was added to the instructions for use in the 
package leaflet (e.g. “In adolescents 12 years and older, it is recommended that Dupixent be administered by 
or under supervision of an adult”, “Do not give yourself a second dose without speaking to your healthcare 
provider”).  
In conclusion, the information related to the device performance and the underfill addressed the possibility 
that the difference in bioequivalence that had been observed was attributable to the device/quality aspects of 
the product. Therefore, the major objection was satisfactorily addressed from the quality perspective. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

submitted in this application as they were submitted with the original atopic 
dermatitis application . . Pharmacology 
A summary of previously assessed data relevant to this application is provided below. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology in vitro 
The  initial  characterising  experiments  demonstrated  that  dupilumab  had  a  high  affinity  for  human  IL-4Rα, 
with  a  KD  of  12  pM  to  the  dimeric  form  of  the  receptor.  However,  subsequent  surface  plasma  resonance 
experiments  using  the  Biacore  system  suggested  a  much  diminished  ability  to  bind  IL-4Rα  of  mouse  or 
monkey origin. Therefore, surrogate antibodies were generated, REGN1103 and REGN646, which bind to IL-
4Rα of mouse and monkey origin respectively. These surrogate antibodies were shown to have affinities in a 
similar range as that of dupilumab. 
Further  in  vitro  characterisation  of  dupilumab  and  the  surrogate  antibodies  was  performed.  Dupilumab  was 
shown  to  bind  to  CD20  positive  lymphocytes  which  was  blocked  by  pre-incubation  with  excess  IL-4.  Using 
STAT6  mediated  luciferase  expression  as  a  readout  of  activity  of  either  IL-4  or  IL-13  signalling,  dupilumab 
demonstrated  a  similar  IC50  of  25  or  27  pM  for  IL-4  or  IL-13  mediated  STAT6  signalling  respectively. 
Increased  cell  surface  expression  of  CD23  was  also  inhibited  by  dupilumab  in  human  PBMCs  and  in  the 
Ramos lymphoma cell line. Inhibition of secretion of TARC, a type 2 chemokine whose secretion is mediated 
by IL-4 or IL-13, was also inhibited by dupilumab in PBMCs isolated from donors. 
Given  that  dupilumab  is  a  human  IgG4  molecule,  Fc-effector  function  is  not expected.  In  accordance,  using 
cell lines expressing IL-4Rα, no ADCC or CDC activity of dupilumab against target cells could be detected.  
Functional characterisation studies with the surrogate antibodies were also performed. REGN1103, the mouse 
surrogate antibody, inhibited IL-4- and IL-13-dependent proliferation of cell lines at IC50’s of 1.9 nM and 11 
pM respectively. Similar experiments to those performed with dupilumab were also performed for REGN646, 
the  monkey  surrogate  antibody.  REGN646  inhibited  IL-4  and  IL-13-mediated  signalling  as  measured  by 
STAT6  mediated  luciferase  expression  or  TARC  secretion.  Flow  cytometry  analysis  showed  a  comparable 
staining pattern of human and monkey lymphocytes by dupilumab and REGN646, respectively.  
Primary pharmacology in vivo 
Due  to  the  lack  of  an  in  vivo  model  of  atopic  dermatitis  the  proof  of  principle  experiments  have  been 
performed using classical models of type 2 immune response which have been shown to be mediated at least 
in  part  through  signalling  via  IL-4  and  IL-13.  To  this  end,  a  genetically  engineered  transgenic  mouse  was 
established which expresses human IL-4 and IL-4Rα and was validated as a system in human to evaluate the 
efficacy  of  dupilumab  in  vivo.  Using  this  transgenic  mouse,  efficacy  of  dupilumab  was  demonstrated  in  a 
model of IL-25 induced Type-2-driven inflammation. Maximum pharmacodynamic response was evident at 25

mg/kg  of  dupilumab  as  shown  by  examining  goblet  cell  metaplasia,  total  serum  IgE  levels  as  well  as  lung 
histopathology score. In a model of house dust mite (HDM) allergen lung inflammation efficacy was seen with 
sub-cutaneous  administration  of  25  mg/kg  of  dupilumab  twice  weekly  for  a  period  of  4  weeks.  Dupilumab 
treatment reduced the total levels of IgE in HDM treated mice to that of control untreated animals, as well as 
inhibiting the activation of eosinophils and goblet cell metaplasia.  
Additional in vivo studies in wild-type mice were conducted with REGN1103, a surrogate monoclonal antibody 
specific  for  murine  IL-4Rα.  Efficacy  of  REGN1103  in  mice  was  studied  in  HDM-induced  lung  inflammation. 
When  given  in  parallel  to  allergen  exposition  over  four  weeks,  REGN1103  achieved  the  expected 
pharmacologic  effect.    Treatment  was  associated  with  reduced  pulmonary  eosinophil  infiltration,  reduced  in 
goblet  cell  metaplasia  and  less  total  IgE  and  HDM-specific  IgG1  in  serum.  The  study  provides  a  proof-of-
concept for the inhibition of IL-4Rα in hyperactive type 2 immune responses. 
In  order  to  support  the  therapeutic  effect  of  dupilumab  in  allergic  asthma,  an  additional  study  with 
humanized  mice  was  conducted.  Herein,  mice  were  challenged  with  HDM  three  times  per  week  for  four 
weeks.  Dupilumab  blocked  HDM-induced  eosinophil  infiltration  into  the  lungs  and  reduced  the  number  of 
activated CD23+ B cells and ST2+ CD4+ T cells in both blood and lung tissue. As blockage of eosinophil lung 
infiltration  by  dupilumab  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  blood  eosinophils  compared  to  controls,  this 
suggests  that  dupilumab  does  not  impact  the  eosinophil  generation  but  rather  prevents  infiltration  into  the 
lung tissue. Dupilumab also prevented HDM-induced impairment in lung function and prevented expression of 
chemoattractant  chemokines  and  type  2  cytokines.  In  summary,  the  data  support  a  beneficial  role  of 
dupilumab in allergic asthma.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  performed  because  no  test  article-related  adverse  primary 
pharmacodynamics  or  changes  to  safety  pharmacology  parameters  were  observed 
in  nonclinical 
pharmacology and toxicology studies, indicating absence of off-target effect. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In line with ICH S6(R1) safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No dupilumab-related effects were observed on cardiovascular, respiratory 
or CNS function.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new PK studies were submitted for the asthma indication , However a summary of the available data from 
the initial marketing authorisation  in atopic dermatitis is provided below. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  dupilumab  were  evaluated  in  single-dose  PK  studies  in  rats  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys  after  IV  and  SC  administration  to  provide  PK  information  in  the  absence  of  target-mediated 
clearance.  PK/TK  of  REGN646  were  evaluated  were  evaluated  after  single  and  repeated  IV  or  SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys; TK of REGN1103 was evaluated after SC administration in mice. The 
SC route is the proposed clinical route of administration.  
A qualified ELISA was used for detection of dupilumab in rat and cynomolgus serum. Validated ELISAs were 
used for detection of REGN1103 in mouse serum and REGN646 in cynomolgus serum. For detection of anti-
REGN646 antibodies in cynomolgus a bridging ECL assay was developed and validated.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 23/161 
  
  
  
PK characteristics of dupilumab after single IV and SC administration in rats and cynomolgus were typical for 
a  monoclonal  antibody  and  consistent  with  a lack  of  target binding.  In  both  species, the  concentration-time 
profile  of  dupilumab  was  characterized  by  an  initial  distribution  or  absorption  phase  following  IV  or  SC 
administration, respectively, followed by a single elimination phase. The mean half-life of dupilumab ranged 
from  4.8  –  7  days  in  rats  and  11.7  to  20.5  days  in  cynomolgus  and  was  comparable  following  IV  or  SC 
administration. The bioavailability following SC dosing was high (84.2 % in rats, > 92% in cynomolgus).  
PK  of  REGN646  in  cynomolgus  was  characterized  by  non-linear  kinetics,  which  is  consistent  with  target-
mediated  disposition.  After  single  IV  administration  (ranging  from  1  –  15  mg/kg),  Cmax  increased 
approximately  dose-proportionally  while  AUCinf  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose-proportional  manner. 
Elimination  of  REGN646  was  biphasic,  with  a  long  β  elimination  phase  and  a  more  rapid  terminal  target 
elimination  phase.  Consistently,  the  mean  beta  elimination  half-life  of  REGN646  at  serum  concentrations 
above the target-saturation ranged from 7.2 to 9.1 days while the mean terminal elimination half-life was 1.5 
–  2.1  at  concentrations  where  target-mediated  elimination  is  the  primary  clearance  process.  The  absolute 
bioavailability of REGN646 following SC administration was approx. 70.0%. After repeated once weekly doses 
of 25 and 100 mg/kg/week, accumulation of REGN646 was observed, ranging from 2.2 to 4.6-fold.  
REGN1103 showed non-linear kinetics in mice; increases in exposure were greater than dose-proportional at 
lower doses and approximately dose-proportional at doses ≥ 25 mg/kg/week.  
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not conducted.  
Since  dupilumab  and  the  surrogate  antibodies,  REGN1103  and  REGN646,  are  large  proteins  that  are  above 
the glomerular filtration cut-off threshold, they are primarily eliminated by proteolytic catabolism that results 
in  smaller  peptides  and  amino  acids  that  can  be  reused  for  new  protein  synthesis.  The  clearance  of 
therapeutic  monoclonal  antibodies  typically  does  not  involve  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)-mediated 
metabolism or interaction with cell membrane transporters, therefore pharmacokinetic interactions with small 
molecule  drugs  are  limited.  However,  published  literature  suggests  IL-4  plays  a  role  in  the  regulation  of 
CYP1E2,  a  highly  conserved  protein  that  is  involved  in  paracetamol  and  alcohol  metabolism.  The  clinical 
significance of this is unclear, and the applicants have currently ongoing a drug-drug interaction study (R668-
AD-1433)  designed  to  examine  the  effects  of  dupilumab  on  the  PK  of  selected  CYP450  substrates  in  adult 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No  new  toxicology  studies  were  submitted  for  the  asthma  indication,  however  a  summary  of  the  available 
data from the initial marketing authorisation  in atopic dermatitis is provided below. 
Dupilumab is specific for human IL-4Rα and does not adequately interact with IL-4Rα from non-clinical 
species. Therefore the toxicity of IL-4Rα blockade was evaluated using surrogate antibodies specific for 
cynomolgus or mouse IL-4Rα. The pharmacologic activity of these surrogate antibodies was adequately 
characterized and is considered comparable to that of dupilumab.  
Single dose toxicity 
No data were provided in this application however single dose toxicity studies were performed for the initial 
approval for Atopic Dermatitis, this is acceptable by CHMP. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 24/161 
 
  
  
  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose studies of up to 26 weeks duration were conducted with REGN646 in cynomolgus monkeys. In 
these studies, once weekly IV or SC treatment with REGN646 at doses up to 100 mg/kg was well tolerated. 
No REGN646-related adverse effects were noted. Lymphocytic infiltrates were observed at the SC injection 
sites. These are considered a reaction to injection of high concentration of human protein. 
Of note, no immunological effects of REGN646 were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were 
no test-article-related changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations. In addition, there were no 
treatment-related changes in serum IgM, IgG and IgE, with the exception of the 13-week study. In this 
study, lower IgE serum levels were observed in individual monkeys who had received saturating doses of 
REGN646. However, this finding is considered a pharmacologic effect of IL-4Rα blockade. Furthermore, 
REGN646 treatment did not affect the development of an antibody response to immunization with KLH. The 
primary and secondary IgM and IgG response against KLH in REGN646-treated cynomolgus was comparable 
to that of control animals.  
In summary, no adverse effects were observed in the repeat-dose studies. In all studies, the NOAEL was the 
highest dose administered and was associated with a Ctrough of 4150 µg/ml and an AUC0-168h of 791,000 
µg*h/ml at 100 mg/kg SC in the chronic toxicity study. Given that the toxicity studies were conducted with a 
surrogate antibody a direct comparison of exposure multiples in the toxicity studies with exposure of 
dupilumab in humans is not considered meaningful. However, the Ctrough at the end of treatment in the 
chronic toxicity study corresponds to 52x of IC90 determined for REGN646-mediated inhibition of IL-4-
stimulated TARC section in vitro. This indicates that a sufficiently high exposure to REGN646 was maintained 
throughout the study.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1). This is acceptable. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted for this asthma submission. However, an updated assessment of 
the carcinogenic potential of dupilumab was made based on literature data on the role of the IL-4/IL-13 
pathway in tumour development and on non-clinical data for both REGN646 and REGN1103. 
The majority of literature data indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 mediate pro-tumorigenic effects either by directly 
promoting tumour cell proliferation or indirectly via the activation of immunomodulatory cells. Such effects 
would be inhibited by anti-IL-4Rα treatment. In addition, results from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in 
mice and cynomolgus do not indicate a carcinogenic risk. The applied weight of evidence approach is in 
accordance with ICH S6 (R1). It can be agreed that chronic treatment with dupilumab is not associated with 
an increased risk of cancer. In contrast, blockade of IL-4Rα signalling may contribute to inhibition of tumour 
growth.  
For this submission, no publications were identified that would change the conclusions of the original 
document.

Reproduction toxicity 
The effect of IL-4Rα inhibition on fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in mice treated 
with the surrogate mAb. Subcutaneous administration of REGN1103 to adult male and female mice at 25, 75, 
or 200 mg/kg/week did not result in any compound-related mortality. There were no REGN1103-related 
clinical signs, effects on body weight or food consumption, macroscopic observations or microscopic findings. 
In addition, there were no compound-related effects on mating, fertility, oestrous cycling, embryo survival or 
any of the male reproductive assessments (organ weights). Therefore, dupilumab is not expected to have an 
effect on fertility. 
In the cynomolgus enhanced pre-/post-natal development study, there were no REGN646-related maternal 
effects. The incidence of embryo-foetal loss was higher in REGN646-treated groups (32.4% combined 25 and 
100 mg/kg groups) than in the control group (25%) but was within the range of historical control data 
reported at the test facility (6.7 – 38.9%). In the surviving offspring, there were no REGN646-related 
findings. According to the agreed PIP, juvenile animal toxicity studies have not been conducted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dupilumab is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment. Therefore, dupilumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  pharmacology  studies  have  demonstrated  that  dupilumab  has  a  high  affinity  for  the  human  IL-4Rα 
receptor  and  a  much  lower  affinity  for  IL-4Rα  of  mouse  and  monkey  origin  necessitating  the  generation  of 
surrogate  antibodies.  The  surrogate  antibodies,  REGN1103  and  REGN646  demonstrated  affinities  to  mouse 
and  monkey  IL-4Rα  respectively  in  a  comparable,  albeit  lower,  range  to  that  of  dupilumab  to  hIL-4Rα.  The 
staining  pattern  of  human  and  monkey  lymphocytes  by  dupilumab  and  REGN646,  respectively  was 
comparable. In vitro functionality of these antibodies was demonstrated in cells of the respective species with 
inhibition  of  IL-4  or  IL-13  dependent  signalling.  Although  no  preclinical  models  of  atopic  dermatitis  were 
available  a  transgenic  mouse  expressing  hIL-4  and  hIL-4Rα  was  generated  and  used  for  proof  of  efficacy 
studies with dupilumab in models of type 2 immune responses. An additional mouse study was conducted to 
support  the  efficacy  of  dupilumab  in  allergic  asthma  and  submitted  in  this  application.  Herein,  the  data 
support  a  beneficial  role  of  dupilumab.  Similar  in  vivo  experiments  were  performed  demonstrating  efficacy 
with the mouse surrogate REGN1103 antibody. Taken together the studies provide a comprehensive basis for 
the  potential  mechanism  of  action  of  dupilumab  in  atopic  dermatitis  and  lung  inflammation  as  well  as 
establishing the appropriateness of the surrogate antibodies for the toxicity studies.  
Carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with  dupilumab.  An  evaluation  of  the  available  evidence 
(literature  data)  related  to  IL-4Rα  inhibition  and  animal  toxicology  data  with  surrogate  antibodies  does  not 
suggest an increased carcinogenic potential for dupilumab. 
In  rats  and  monkeys  dupilumab  exhibited  linear  kinetics  as expected  in  species  that  do  not  bind dupilumab 
with  high  affinity.  No  target-mediated  clearance  was  observed  and  total  dupilumab  exposure  was 
approximately  dose  proportional.  In  monkeys  REGN646,  the  monkey  surrogate  anti-IL-4Rα  antibody, 
displayed  non-linear  kinetics.  The  concentration-time  profiles  of  REGN646  are  characterized  by  an  initial 
distribution  phase  following  IV  administration,  or  an  absorption  phase  following  SC  administration,  followed 
by a target-saturating beta elimination phase and a terminal target-mediated elimination phase. The target-

mediated elimination is most notable at the lower concentrations. Low volumes of distribution are seen along 
with  long  elimination  half-life,  which  are  typical  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  monoclonal  Abs.  The 
presence  of  ADA  in  animals  in  the  REGN646  monkey  study  clearly  impacted  the  rate  of  drug  clearance 
observed  in  the  study  especially  at  lower  concentrations,  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  adverse  toxicity 
associated with the occurrence of ADA. 
To  support  the  safety  of  dupilumab,  a  toxicology  programme  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  current 
guidance  and  considered  adequate.  Given  the  lack  of  cross-reactivity  of  dupilumab  with  IL-4Rα  from  non-
clinical  species,  surrogate  mAbs  were  used,  which  is  acceptable.  By  and  large  the  repeated-dose  toxicity 
studies IL-4Rα blockade did not reveal any adverse effects.   
The effect of IL-4Rα blockade on reproductive and developmental toxicity was evaluated in a fertility study in 
mice which and in an ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys. No adverse effects on fertility were noted. 
In  the  present  submission,  a  new  strength  (from  150  mg/mL  to  175  mg/mL)  and  formulation    was 
introduced.  As  the  excipients  remain  the  same  and  the  formulation  is  only  slightly  different,  no  new  local 
tolerance studies are warranted.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies are sufficient to support the asthma indication and new dosage form of dupilumab. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The to-be marketed dupilumab drug product (DP) for the asthma indication is a liquid formulation at a 
concentration of either 150 mg/mL or 175 mg/mL, supplied as PFS or PFP, to deliver a dose of 300 mg or 200 
mg for SC Q2W. The intended posology of Dupixent for patients with asthma is 200 mg SC Q2W after an 
initial loading dose of 400 mg. In patients with oral corticosteroids-dependent asthma or with co-morbid 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis for which Dupixent is indicated, the intended posology is 300 mg SC 
Q2W after an initial dose of 600 mg. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 28/161 
 
 
  
  
  
The clinical pharmacology program for the asthma indication consisted of two Phase 2 studies (Studies 
ACT11457, DRI12544) and three Phase 3 studies (Studies EFC13579, EFC13691, LTS12551) in which 
dupilumab was administered SC QW, Q2W, or Q4W for treatment periods ranging from 12 weeks to 96 
weeks. In these studies, only sparse PK sampling was conducted. In addition, Study R668-AD-1607 was an 
actual-use study in adult and adolescent patients with AD and provided data on the comparison of PFS with 
PFP. In this study, dense PK sampling was performed. 
Analytical methods 
The PK assay methods for determination of dupilumab concentrations in the studies contributing to clinical 
pharmacology data in this extension of indication application were identical to those used for the AD program 
(REGN668-AV-09095-VA-01V2 and REGN668-AV-13074-VA-01V1). Functional dupilumab concentration in 
serum samples was analysed using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
The anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay method (REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V3) and the neutralizing antibody 
(NAb) assay method (REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2) were updated as compared to the assay methods used 
in the AD program (ADA assay methods: REGN668-AV-09106-VA-01V2 and REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V2; 
neutralizing ADA assay method: REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V1). In addition, a new ADA method (REGN668-
AV-15153-VA-01V1) was developed and validated. In general, the ADA method is based on a non-
quantitative, titer-based, electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay which involves acid dissociation. 
The standard three-tier approach is applied (screening, confirmation and titer/NAb analysis). 
Population PK Analysis 
A population PK (Pop PK) analysis of dupilumab PK samples was conducted using data from healthy subjects 
and adolescent and adult asthma patients. Although only sparse data have been recruited in asthma patients, 
the overall data package on clinical pharmacology is sufficient. Parameter estimates of the final asthma Pop 
PK model for dupilumab described the observed dupilumab PK acceptably well. A two-compartment model 
with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination with first order absorption was selected.  
 Table – Parameter estimates of asthma Pop PK model for dupilumab 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 29/161 
  
  
  
Absorption/distribution/ metabolism/elimination 
In patients with asthma, dupilumab is well-absorbed: Model-estimated SC bioavailability was 61% and 
absorption rate constant was 0.260/day. Following SC administration, the concentration-time profile of 
dupilumab was characterized by an SC absorption phase (median tmax of 3 to 7 days). 
• 
 Relative Bioavailability 
Study R668-AD-1607 was an open-label, randomized, actual use study of dupilumab in adult and adolescent 
patients with AD. In Part A of this study, patients with moderate to severe AD received dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w via PFP device or PFS, with a loading dose of 400 mg on Day 1. The study was not formally powered to 
show PK comparability/bioequivalence between PFS and PFP. The comparison of systemic dupilumab 
exposure (AUC, Cmax, Ctrough) between PFS and PFP was included as secondary objective in the study 
(Table 7).  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 30/161 
 
  
  
  
At both time points the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratios for AUC(0-14), Cmax and 
Ctrough were not contained within the acceptance interval of 0.8 – 1.25 interval. 
Distribution primarily took place within the vascular compartment (model-estimated volume of distribution at 
4.37 L). 
For a monoclonal antibody, the elimination of dupilumab is expected to be limited to proteolytic catabolism to 
small peptides and individual amino acids, and therefore, no specific metabolism or excretion studies were 
conducted. 
Dupilumab exhibits nonlinear PK with target-mediated disposition. At higher concentrations, elimination is 
predominantly through the linear, non-saturable proteolytic pathway; at lower concentrations, the nonlinear 
saturable target-mediated elimination pathway predominates. 
Linear clearance has been derived to 0.115 L/day. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
At steady-state concentrations for 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w regimens, dupilumab PK exhibited a more 
than dose-proportional increases in exposure.  
In Study DRI12544, 4 dose regimens have been examined. A 1.5-fold dose increase from 200 mg and 300 
mg resulted in a steady-state trough concentration increase (Week 16) by 2.06-fold (29.2 to 60.3 mg/L) for 
q2w regimens and 3.46-fold (3.61 to 12.5 mg/L) for q4w regimens, respectively. A similar observation was 
noted in Study EFC13579, where a 1.86-fold increase from 36.5 mg/L to 67.8 mg/L in the mean Ctrough at 
Week 16 for a 1.5 fold dose increase from 200 mg q2w to 300 mg q2w has been observed. This is deemed 
acceptable for a monoclonal antibody that is characterized by non-linear target-mediated kinetics. 
After the last SC dose at steady state, the model-predicted median time for dupilumab concentration to 
decline from PK steady-state to below the LLOQ (0.078 mg/L) level was 9 weeks for the 200 mg q2w regimen 
and 11 weeks for the 300 mg q2w regimen in patients with asthma. 
Based on the asthma Pop PK model, the median time to steady-state was 6 weeks for 200 mg q2w with 400 
mg loading dose and 8 weeks for 300 mg q2w with 600 mg loading dose in a typical individual. Longterm 
data showed that Ctrough, ss achieved by Week 16 were maintained up to two years during treatment in 
patients with asthma, indicating the lack of time-dependent changes in dupilumab PK. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 31/161 
 
  
  
  
Loading doses: administration of the loading dose does not result in systemic exposure that may exceed the 
steady-state levels at 200 mg or 300 mg q2w regimens but helps in reaching the steady state more rapidly. 
The difference in exposure with and without loading dose is thus mainly limited to the first 12 weeks before 
reaching the same steady-state levels, which is deemed plausible and acceptable. This is supported by a fast 
response of PD biomarker time profiles. 
Intra- and interindividual variability 
The asthma Pop PK analysis showed moderate inter-individual variability in PK parameters Fsc, Ke, V2 and 
Vm (36.3%, 19.6%, 9.13%, and 24.3%, respectively), as derived by population PK analysis. The inclusion of 
covariates into the base population PK model did not serve to explain the inter-individual variability observed 
among the patients.  
PK in the target population 
 Figure 4 - Comparison of mean trough concentration-time profiles between asthma and AD adult populations 
at 300 mg q2w (with a 600 mg loading dose) 
Based on the Pop PK analysis, there is no significant difference in dupilumab PK between healthy subjects 
and patients with asthma. Within the overall asthma population, both the descriptive comparison and the Pop 
PK demonstated that dupilumab PK profile in severe OCS-dependent asthma patients (Study EFC13691) is 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 32/161 
 
 
  
  
  
comparable to those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Dupilumab PK is also comparable 
between asthma and AD populations. 
Special populations 
From the tested intrinsic and extrinsic factors the following covariates have been selected by stepwise 
covariate modelling (SCM) and included in the final asthma population PK model.  
Central volume of distribution V2 was significantly related to body weight and albumin, with larger V2 in 
patients with higher body weight and lower albumin level. Vmax was significantly related to body weight, 
with greater Vmax in patients with higher body weight. Ke was significantly related to ADA status, CLCRN, 
and body weight, with higher Ke in patients with higher body weight, higher CLCRN and positive ADA status 
(positive at any time).  
Body weight remained the primary source responsible for dupilumab PK variability in the asthma population, 
reducing inter-individual variability for V2 from 14.8% to 9.5%, while inclusion of other covariates only led to 
a modest reduction of inter-individual variabilities. In contrast, none of the other tested covariates had a 
significant effect on dupilumab PK in asthma population. 
Covariate analysis indicated that body weight accounts for most of inter-patient variability in exposure 
compared to other statistically significant covariates, including ADA status, CLCRN and albumin causing less 
than 20% change in exposure estimated at 5th or 95th percentile of the covariate range relative to the 
reference individual. The influence of body weight, that was investigated over the range of 32 – 186 kg, could 
be detected on the volume of distribution and on elimination of dupilumab. This translates to a respective 
decrease of 48.0% or 40.7% in the steady state AUCτ,ss for a typical patient weighing 116 kg (the 95th 
percentile) and a respective increase of 68.8% or 56.7% for a typical patient weighing 52.9 kg (the 5th 
percentile), as compared with a typical patient of 78 kg (median weight) after 200 mg or 300 mg q2w doses, 
respectively. This effect was slightly more pronounced regarding the change in Cmin_ss. Despite body 
weight, a high variability in the data remained unexplained.  
As only a very flat exposure-response and dose-response relation regarding efficacy could be observed, no 
need for dose adjustment by weight is indicated. 
Higher exposure (about 1.5 – 2 fold) is observed in adolescent patients compared to adults in both dosing 
groups.  However, for the higher dosing, this trend was more pronounced and still present when comparing 
the exposure of adolescent and adults patients stratified by weight groups. To some degree, it is likely that 
exposure differences between adolescent and adult asthma patients are correlated with body weight effect.  
The PK in severe oral corticosteroid dependent asthma patients (EFC13691) and in non-OCS dependent 
asthma patients (DRI12544 and EFC13579) was highly comparable as the final asthma population PK model 
was able to predict the patient exposures from study EFC13691 acceptably well. 
Interactions 
Dupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, directed against IL-4Rα, is not expected to have a direct or indirect 
effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-mediated metabolism. This was confirmed in the drug interaction 
Study R668-AD-1433 in patients with atopic dermatitis, where there was no clinically relevant effect of 
dupilumab on the activities of CYP isoforms including CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A. The results indicate 
that IL-4/IL-13 has no meaningful impact on CYP enzymes in vivo.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 33/161 
  
  
  
The impact of concomitant medications (defined as any treatments received concomitantly to dupilumab from 
the first dupilumab administration of to the end of post-treatment period) on dupilumab PK were assessed in 
the Pop PK analysis. The comparison of the post hoc estimates of exposure showed no apparent effect of 
concomitant use of common asthma controllers (LTRA, LABA, systemic corticosteroids, methylxanthines) on 
dupilumab exposure. Further, patients from Study EFC13691 with regular treatment of maintenance OCS 
showed similar PK exposure to those not on OCS (Study EFC13579). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab binds specifically to the IL-4Rα subunit and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 mediated signalling. The 
blocking of the IL-4Rα receptor subunit with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 (Type 2) cytokine-induced 
responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE through this pathway. 
Biomarkers of Type 2 inflammation include eosinophil, IgE, TARC/CCL17, periostin, eotaxin-3 and airway 
inflammation biomarker FeNO. Dupilumab treatment has been shown to consistently induce rapid and 
substantial reduction in FeNO, TARC, periostin, eotaxin-3 as well as total and antigen specific IgE. 
PD Biomarker 
Mean percent change in FeNO over time following 24 to 52 weeks of treatments of both envisaged SC 
dupilumab dosing regimens in patients with asthma (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) was equally strong 
and reached before steady state after about 2 weeks.  
The time course of PD biomarkers does not allow for a distinction between both SC dupilumab dosing 
regimen, as they showed highly comparable PD effect and variability throughout the studies, study duration 
and doses. Substantial reduction of PD markers FeNO, TARC, periostin, eotaxin-3 with dupilumab treatment 
with maximum effect achieved rapidly and sustained over the treatment period both regimens. 
Immunogenicity 
Dupilumab immunogenicity was evaluated in all dupilumab clinical studies. Study EFC13579 provides long-
term data on ADA responses in patients with asthma and has sufficient duration (52 weeks) to enable the 
evaluation of persistent ADA responses. 
A summary of ADA incidence for asthma patients in Studies DRI12544, EFC13579, and EFC13691 is provided 
below (Table 17).

PK/PD 
Descriptive and model-based analyses were used to investigate the exposure-response relationship for the 
key clinical efficacy endpoints in the uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma population and severe OCS-
dependent asthma population. 
Semi-mechanistic population PK/PD analysis: The time course for FEV1 following SC administration of 
dupilumab was best described by a direct response model relating dupilumab concentrations with FEV1 
response. The model was based on the combined data from adult and adolescent moderate-to-severe asthma 
patients (non-OCS dependent) in pivotal studies (DRI12544 and EFC13579). The model was parameterized 
with the maximum drug effect (Emax) and the drug concentration to produce 50% of Emax (EC50). The 
placebo effect was included in the model described by an empirical model where Pmax is the maximum 
placebo effect and kplb is the rate constant for placebo effect development. 
Population estimates of dupilumab treatment effect were 0.104 L for Emax and 0.713 mg/L for EC50. The 
inter-individual variability for EC50 was very large, with estimated CV% at 193% and large for Emax 
(84.3%). Shrinkage was high for EC50 (80.3%) and Emax (52.2%), respectively. In general, the precision of 
the parameter estimates was acceptable (%RSE < 21%). The IIV estimates for Emax and baseline FEV1 were 
decreased by 20.7% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to the base model by including covariates. Covariate 
analysis indicated that baseline eosinophil count and FeNO significantly influence the Emax level. A larger 
treatment effect on FEV1 in patients with higher baseline eosinophils and FeNO levels could be detected. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 35/161 
 
 
  
  
  
However a high inter-individual variability that remained unexplained by investigated covariates and high 
shrinkage values regarding Emax and EC50 could be detected. Thus, the small simulated increase (6.25%) in 
FEV1 response for dose 300 mg compared to the 200 mg treatment is not considered a clinically relevant 
finding and does not allow differentiation between the doses. 
Empirical PK/PD modelling (FEV1 response and severe exacerbation): Overall, both the semi-mechanistic and 
the empirical PK/PD analyses identified a similar exposure-response relationship for FEV1 in uncontrolled 
moderate-to-severe asthma patients. The response showed a rapid increase in response with increasing 
dupilumab concentration approaching a response plateau at concentrations reached in both Phase III q2w 
dosing regimens using an Emax-Model. 
Modelling and data indicate a clinically significant improvement in FEV1 for both the 200 and 300 mg q2w 
dosing regimens. Regarding variability, both models identified Type 2 inflammation markers (FeNO and 
eosinophils for the semi-mechanistic model, and FeNO and periostin for the empirical model) as significant 
covariates of the treatment effect on FEV1. Response was higher in patients with elevated biomarker levels. 
In this line, no significant effect of covariate age, body weight, or ADA status could be detected.  
For severe exacerbation event empirical PK/PD modelling, the model estimated EC50 was 8.54 mg/L for 
Study EFC13579 and 17.36 for the DRI1254 Study. Emax was calculated to be -1.525 (severe exacerbation 
events). Baseline EOS, baseline FeNO and asthma age onset were identified as influential factors to the 
treatment efficacy.  
Given the large confidence intervals around these ratios and the estimates of EC50 and Emax, no definite 
benefit of one dosing regimen regarding efficacy can be concluded based on clinical data and PK/PD 
modelling. 
Overall, both the semi-mechanistic and the empirical PK/PD analyses identified a similar exposure-response 
relationship for efficacy in uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma patients. The response showed a rapid 
increase in response with increasing dupilumab concentration approaching a response plateau at 
concentrations reached in both Phase III q2w dosing regimens.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The methods applied for detection of functional dupilumab correspond to the methods used in the initial 
marketing authorisation application for AD and these have been accurately validated. Incurred sample 
reanalysis was conducted in asthma studies ACT11457 and DRI12544 and confirmed that the assay produced 
robust and reproducible results in the asthma population. 
Anti-dupilumab antibodies were detected in serum samples using a validated electrochemi-luminescence 
bridging immunoassay. The applied assay method used in the AD clinical study program was updated 
(REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V3) with additional long-term stability testing, cut points determined for the 
asthma population and drug tolerance level at 120 ng/mL of monoclonal antibody control for the asthma 
population cut point. In addition, due to the observation of a higher background signal in baseline serum 
samples in study DRI12544 the REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V2 method was modified and validated and an 
updated report (REGN668-AV-15153-VA-01V1) was generated. As stated by the applicant, this method uses 
a modified version of the dupilumab drug as one of the bridging components to mitigate the non-dupilumab 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 36/161 
  
  
  
specific background responses and was used to reanalyse samples of patients who had a positive assay 
response at baseline in the screening assay of the original assay method REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V2 (2-
assay approach). In this respect, the appropriateness of the original assay method REGN668-AV-13089-VA-
01V2 was questioned and the applicant was asked for a justification for not testing all samples with the 
modified assay method REGN668-AV-15153-VA-01V1 given the obviously higher selectivity of the assay. 
Additionally, the applicant was requested to provide the method validation report of the modified assay 
REGN668-AV-15153-VA-01V1. The validation report for the modified ADA assay REGN668-AV-15153-VA-
01V1 was submitted as part of the response package. Validation results reveal that the assay method used 
was appropriate to adequately analyse the ADA response to dupilumab. The applicant further adequately 
justified that only those samples with pre-existing reactivity were re-analysed with the modified assay. 
The previous method for NAb detection was updated (REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2) to add the analysis of 
the validation data using the 19% inhibition cut point (1% false positive rate) and to add an additional 
recovery experiment investigating hemoglobin interference. 
 Relative Bioavailability  (Study R668-AD-1607) 
Study R668-AD-1607 investigated the systemic exposure of 200 mg dupilumab (Part A) administered SC 
using PFP device versus PFS. The study was not formally powered to show bioequivalence between PFS and 
PFP. The geometric mean ratio for AUC(0-14) was 0.723 (90% CI: 0.635-0.823) at study day 1 and 0.903 
(90% CI: 0.767-1.063) at study day 85 (steady state). The geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 0.741 (90% 
CI: 0.655-0.839) at study day 1 and 0.890 (90% CI: 0.779-1.017) at study day 85 (steady state).  
Based on the presented data, it has to be assumed that the two presentations are not bioequivalent since the 
bioequivalence margin (0.8-1.25) for the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio was not met 
in any of the investigated exposure parameters (AUC, Cmax, Ctrough) Of note, the study was not powered to 
allow for definitive statements with regards to bioequivalence. The applicant was however requested to 
thoroughly elucidate possible reasons for this unexpected difference in dupilumab exposure. In response, the 
applicant provided a thorough discussion and additional supportive data so that it might now be concluded 
that the performance of both the 1 mL PFP and 1 mL PFS can be considered similar and the potentially 
present differences are not clinically meaningful. 
Population PK Analysis 
A population PK (Pop PK) analysis of dupilumab PK samples was conducted using data from healthy subjects 
and adolescent and adult asthma patients. Although only sparse data have been recruited in asthma patients, 
the overall data package on clinical pharmacology is sufficient. Parameter estimates of the final asthma Pop 
PK model for dupilumab described the observed dupilumab PK acceptably well. A two-compartment model 
with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination with first order absorption was selected. In response to the list 
of questions, the applicant adequately elaborated on the influence of shrinkage on the covariate selection 
procedure and the relevance of this regarding the PK/PD models for investigating the exposure-efficacy 
relationship. 
Higher exposure (about 1.5 – 2 fold) is observed in adolescent patients compared to adults in both dosing 
groups.  However, for the higher dosing, this trend was more pronounced and still present when comparing 
the exposure of adolescent and adults patients stratified by weight groups. To some degree, it is likely that 
exposure differences between adolescent and adult asthma patients are correlated with body weight effect.  
ADME 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 37/161 
  
  
  
In patients with asthma, dupilumab is absorbed with an estimated SC bioavailability at 61%. PK is 
characterized by a limited volume of distribution estimated to 4.37 L and by non-linear target-mediated 
elimination. Linear clearance has been derived to 0.115 L/day. This value was derived using the estimated Ke 
value. 
The asthma Pop PK analysis showed moderate inter-individual variability in PK parameters Fsc, Ke, V2 and 
Vm (36.3%, 19.6%, 9.13%, and 24.3%, respectively as derived by population PK analysis). In response to 
the list of questions, the applicant further provided the estimate for IIV on linear clearance, which was 26.7% 
(%CV) in the base model and was reduced to 20.5% after inclusion of weight effects.  
Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD  
Both the semi-mechanistic and the empirical PK/PD analyses identified a similar exposure-response 
relationship for FEV1 response and severe exacerbation event in uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma 
patients. The predicted response showed a rapid increase in response with increasing dupilumab 
concentration approaching a response plateau at concentrations reached in both Phase III q2w dosing 
regimens using different PK metrics. 
An analysis investigating the exposure-safety and dose-safety relationship has been provided in response to 
the d120 LoQ in order to better decipher and assess the risk-benefit profile regarding the envisaged dosing 
regimen for all patients and for adolescent patients in particular. There was no apparent dose relationship for 
any particular treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) except for injection site reactions, which occurred 
at a higher incidence with the 300 mg q2w dose. 
Immunogenicity 
Throughout the entire Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, the analysis of anti-dupilumab antibodies revealed a 
consistent trend towards decreased incidence of ADA with higher dupilumab doses.  
The development of ADA was associated with lower dupilumab concentrations (positive ADA predicted to 
result in less than 20% lower steady state AUCτ), which did not have an impact on efficacy and/or safety in 
case of low to moderate ADA titers. A meaningful reduction of dupilumab exposure was observed in patients 
with high titers (>10 000). However, the incidence of high titer ADA responses was low (<1%) and this issue 
is therefore not further pursued.  
The incidence of ADA was comparable between asthma and AD studies. Referring to Study EFC13579, there 
was no difference in ADA incidence or character in the adolescent population as compared to the adult 
population. 
In Study DRI12544, higher rates of treatment-emergent and persistent ADA as compared to the Phase 3 
studies have been observed. The applicant elaborated that differences in ADA incidence between studies 
DRI12544 and EFC13579 were mainly associated with the low titer category. This finding might have resulted 
by chance due to the smaller sample size in study DRI12544 or due to minor differences in background 
immunoreactivity between both studies, which might have led to samples being considered (“borderline”) 
ADA positive more frequently. Taking into account that differences in immunogenicity rates did not have an 
impact on exposure, efficacy and safety of dupilumab, the issue is now  considered resolved. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 38/161 
  
  
  
Analytical methods mainly corresponded to the methods applied in the initial MAA for AD. Only the ADA 
analysis method was modified and validated. 
Remaining uncertainties with regard to the bioequivalence of the newly to-be-marketed PFP compared to the 
PFS were sufficiently addressed by the applicant and it was concluded that the performance of both the 1 mL 
PFP and 1 mL PFS can be considered similar and the differences are not clinically meaningful. 
Overall, the immunogenicity of dupilumab in the asthma population was low and comparable to the AD 
population. In study DRI12544 the incidence of ADA was unusually high compared to other studies, which 
adequately discussed by the applicant. This issue is now considered resolved mainly taking into account that 
differences in ADA status did not have an impact on exposure, efficacy and safety of dupilumab. 
The data package on clinical pharmacology was deemed sufficient to characterize the PK of dupilumab in the 
target population.  
From PK/PD modelling and data, no dose-efficacy and exposure-efficacy relationship can be concluded. Both 
doses showed equal efficacy compared to placebo. An analysis investigating the exposure-safety and dose-
safety relationship has been provided by the applicant upon CHMP request. There was no apparent dose 
relationship for any particular treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) except for injection site reactions, 
which occurred at a higher incidence with the 300 mg q2w dose. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
As of the last data cut date for this submission dossier (30 September 2017), the dupilumab asthma clinical 
program consisted of 7 studies, of which 5 are included in the submission. 
Two completed Phase 2 studies, of which one is a pivotal study: 
•  ACT11457 was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept (POC) 
study in patients with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma with eosinophilic phenotype. 
•  DRI12544 was a pivotal 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging, Phase 
2b study in patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. The CSR and a partial dataset 
have been submitted previously with the original marketing application for AD. 
Two Phase 3 pivotal studies: 
•  EFC13579 (QUEST) was a pivotal 52-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 
patients with persistent (moderate-to-severe uncontrolled) asthma. It was a confirmatory efficacy 
and safety study with the primary analysis completed (data cutoff of 29 July 2017). 
•  EFC13691 (VENTURE) was a pivotal 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients 
with severe steroid-dependent asthma; the end-of-treatment (EOT) analyses were completed (data 
cutoff of 20 September 2017) 
One ongoing Phase 3 open-label extension (OLE) study: 
• 
LTS12551 (TRAVERSE) is a long-term safety and tolerability study in patients who previously 
participated in another asthma study; an interim CSR was prepared for patients who rolled over from 
Studies DRI12544, EFC13579 and EFC13691 (data cutoff of 29 July 2017). Data for patients who 
rolled over from Study EFC13691 remained blinded with respect to dose regimen in the parent study 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 39/161 
  
  
  
until the parent study database was locked on 16 October 2017. A previous interim CSR was 
submitted with the original marketing application for AD and had a data cutoff of 31 January 2016. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study DRI12544 
Methods 
Study DRI12544 was a pivotal 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging, Phase 
2b study in patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. 
The study consisted of 3 periods, a screening period (14 to 21 days) to determine whether patients met 
eligibility criteria and to establish level of asthma control before the randomized treatment period, a 
randomized treatment period (24 weeks) and a post-treatment period (16 weeks) to monitor patients after 
treatment with a total duration of approximately 43 weeks.

dose ICS/LABA (≥fluticasone propionate 250 μg twice daily or equipotent ICS dosage) for ≥1 month prior to 
Visit 1. During the randomized treatment period as well as upon completion of the randomized treatment 
period, patients continued the stable dose of ICS/LABA of equivalent dosage used during the screening 
period. In addition, patients were allowed to administer salbutamol/albuterol hydrofluoroalkane pressurized 
metered dose inhaler (MDI) or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol hydrofluoroalkane pressurized MDI as reliever 
medication as needed.

The primary objective of the study was: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of different doses and regimens of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-
severe, uncontrolled asthma 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• 
To evaluate different doses and regimens of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe, 
uncontrolled asthma, with regards to: 
- Safety and tolerability

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline at Week 12 in FEV1. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints assessed included: 
•  Relative change (%) from baseline at Week 12 in FEV1 
•  Annualized rate of loss of asthma control events (LOAC) during the treatment period 
•  Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the treatment period 
•

•  Change from baseline at Week 12 in FEV1/FVC ratio 
•  Change from baseline at Week 12 in forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF25-75) 
•  Change from baseline at Week 12 in forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF25-75) 
Two types of asthma exacerbation events were predefined in the protocol: 
A LOAC (Loss of Asthma Control) event during the study was defined as any of the following: 
•  ≥6 additional reliever puffs of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol in a 24-hour period 
(compared with baseline) on 2 consecutive days; or 
• 
Increase in ICS ≥4 times the dose at Visit 2; or 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 42/161 
  
  
  
•  Use of systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days; or 
•  Hospitalization or emergency room visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids 
A severe exacerbation event during the study was defined as a deterioration of asthma requiring: 
•  Use of systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days; or  
•  Hospitalization or ER visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids 
A severe exacerbation event was counted as a LOAC event. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 
•  A 0.2 L mean difference between the highest dupilumab dose and placebo in change from baseline in 
FEV1 
•  A common (SD) of 0.35 (from study ACT11457) 
• 
t-test at a 2-sided 5% significant level with 83% power 
•  Expected early discontinuation rate of 10% 
Based on these assumptions it was calculated that 300 HEos patients (60 per group) would provide 94% 
power to detect a mean difference of 0.24 L as observed from the ACT11457 study. Anticipating a 40% 
recruitment rate for the HEos category, approximately 750 patients were to be randomized in order to 
achieve 300 HEos patients. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in an 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg q2w, dupilumab 200 mg q2w, 
dupilumab 300 mg q4w, dupilumab 200 mg q4w, or placebo. Randomization was stratified by Visit 1 central 
laboratory blood eosinophils (HEos ≥0.3 G/L, eosinophils = 0.2 to 0.299 G/L, and eosinophils <0.2 G/L) and 
country. 
Blinding (masking) 
Dupilumab and placebo were provided in identically matched vials.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were performed on both the overall ITT population (all randomized subjects) and the HEos 
ITT population (all randomized subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 G/L). The primary analysis was 
for the ITT population (based on EMA scientific advice). 
The primary efficacy variable (change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12) was analyzed using a mixed-effect 
model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach with factors (fixed effects) for treatment, baseline 
eosinophil strata, pooled countries / regions, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, FEV1 baseline value, and 
baseline-by-visit interaction. An unstructured correlation matrix was used to model the within-patient errors. 
Parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. 
Differences in least squares (LS) means, corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were

provided for comparison for each dose-regimen against placebo. The FEV1 measurements collected from 
systemic corticosteroid start date to systemic corticosteroid end date + 30 days for each exacerbation 
episode were excluded from the primary analysis in order to reduce the confounding effect of systemic 
corticosteroids.  
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of systemic corticosteroid use and / or missing 
values: 
•  Repeating the main analysis, but including all FEV1 measurements (even following systematic 
corticosteroid use), 
•  Repeating the main analysis, but excluding all FEV1 measurements collected on and after first day of 
systemic corticosteroid use. 
Pattern mixture model-multiple imputation (PMM-MI) 
• 
•  Control based PMM-MI 
• 
Tipping point analysis to search for tipping points that reverse the study conclusion. 
To assess the consistency of treatment effects, pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for the 
primary efficacy variable. 
A negative binomial regression model was used to assess treatment differences in annualized rate of LOAC 
and severe exacerbation events. The model included treatment group, baseline eosinophil strata, pooled 
countries / regions, and number of asthma events prior to the study (number of asthma exacerbation during 
1 year prior to visit 1) as covariates and the log-transformed observation duration as offset. Each active dose 
group was tested separately versus placebo and 2-sided 95% CIs of the rate ratio are provided for each 
treatment group. 
Time to event data was analyzed applying Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox regression was used to assess 
treatment differences. Treatment, baseline eosinophil strata, number of asthma events prior to the study, 
and pooled countries/regions were used as covariates in the Cox regression. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated 
for pairwise comparison between each dose of dupilumab and placebo.  
After database lock a hierarchical testing procedure to assess the efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w was defined, ie, each hypothesis was formally tested only if the preceding one was 
significant at the 2-sided 5% level:  
1)  annualized severe exacerbation rate for 300 mg q2w versus placebo,  
2)  absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12 for 300 mg q2w versus placebo,  
3)  annualized severe exacerbation rate for 200 mg q2w versus placebo,  
4)  absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12 for 200 mg q2w versus placebo. 
If both dupilumab doses were significant for both primary endpoints further tests were to be performed 
following a hierarchical testing procedure at a 2-sided 5% significant level. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 776 patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 dupilumab dose groups (200 mg q4w: 154, 300 mg 
q4w: 157, 200 mg q2w: 150, and 300 mg q2w: 157) or placebo (158). Of them, 325 patients (40.3% to 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 44/161 
 
  
  
  
43.3% of the overall population in the different treatment groups) had elevated (≥0.3 G/L) blood eosinophils 
at baseline and constituted the HEos population. Overall, 732 (94.3%) patients completed the 12-week 
primary efficacy endpoint treatment period and 709 (91.4%) patients completed the entire treatment period 
(24 weeks). 
Numbers analysed 
Analysis population – Randomized population 
Baseline characteristics 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in the overall 
randomized population. The mean age was 48.6 years with a range of 18 to 87 years. 63.1% of the patients 
were females and 78.2% of the patients were white. Asthma-specific baseline characteristics were similar 
between treatment groups, including the mean FEV1 percent predicted (dupilumab: 60.3% to 61.2%; 
placebo: 61.0%), mean ACQ-5 score (dupilumab: 2.70 to 2.80; placebo: 2.69), and global AQLQ (dupilumab: 
3.91 to 4.03; placebo: 4.12). 77.3% of the patients had a history of atopic disease, allergic rhinitis being the 
most frequent one (64.7%). 
The primary efficacy analysis population as pre-specified in the SAP was the HEos ITT population. After the 
interim analysis, conducted in the HEos population, had been performed, the Sponsor received feedback from 
both the EMA and FDA, that the primary analysis should be based on the overall ITT population. 
Primary endpoint: In the overall ITT population, the LS mean changes in FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 
were +0.12 L in the placebo group and ranged from +0.21 L (200 mg q4w dose) to +0.31 L (200 mg q2w 
dose) in the 4 dupilumab treatment groups.  When compared with placebo, the LS mean differences were 
significant for dupilumab 200 mg q4w (+0.10 L, p=0.0304), 300 mg q4w (+0.12 L; p=0.0048), 200 mg q2w 
(+0.20 L; p<0.0001), and 300 mg q2w (+0.16 L; p=0.0002).

In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophils <0.3 G/L, dupilumab demonstrated an 
improvement in the changes in FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 at the doses of 200 mg q2w (LS mean 
difference = +0.15 L) and 300 mg q2w (+0.12 L) as compared to placebo, with nominal p-values <0.05, 
while the treatment effect of q4w dose regimens were smaller with nominal p-values >0.05. 
Secondary endpoints:  
In the overall ITT population, improvement in FEV1 induced by all 4 doses dupilumab over placebo was 
observed at Week 12 was and maintained up to Week 24. All 4 doses of dupilumab showed statistically 
significant increases in FEV1 from baseline to Week 24.  
The relative risks for a severe asthma exacerbation, based on the adjusted annualized rate of severe 
exacerbation over the treatment period compared to placebo were 0.463 (200 mg q4w), 0.668 (300 mg 
q4w), 0.300 (200 mg q2w), and 0.295 (300 mg q2w). Statistical significance was demonstrated for 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w regimens.

The other endpoints showed similar efficacy of the two dupilumab doses compared to placebo. 
Results of ACQ-5 and AQLQ questionnaires also supported the efficacy of both the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg 
q2w dose regimens of dupilumab while no significant differences were observed between the two q4w dose 
regimens and placebo. 
A significant improvement in morning and evening asthma symptom scores was observed for all doses of 
dupilumab as compared to placebo in the overall population. 
The two q2w doses also showed a statistically significant improvement in HADS total score in the HEos 
population while in the overall population, only the 200 mg q2w dosing regimen showed a significant effect.

2.5.2.1.  EFC13579 (QUEST) 
Title of study 
EFC13579 (QUEST) 
Methods 
Study EFC13579 was a pivotal 52-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with 
persistent (moderate-to-severe uncontrolled) asthma using dupilumab or placebo as add-on therapy to ICS in 
combination with one or two other controller medicines (eg, LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonists 
[LAMAs], LTRA, methylxanthines). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 49/161 
 
  
  
  
The study consisted of 3 periods with a total duration of 67 to 69 weeks for each patient: screening period 
(4±1 weeks), randomized treatment period (52 weeks), and post-treatment follow-up period (12 weeks). 
Prior to and during the screening period, patients were required to be on a stable dose of medium to high 
dose ICS in combination with a second controller medication (e.g., LABA, LAMA, LTRA, methylxanthines). 
During the randomized treatment period patients continued taking their background controller medication(s) 
at the stable dose used during the screening period. Patients needing a third controller were also eligible for 
this study.  
Randomization was stratified by age (<18 years, ≥18 years), central laboratory blood eosinophil count (<0.3 
Giga/L, ≥0.3 Giga/L), ICS dose (medium, high), and country at screening. 
Study participants  
At least 1638 patients were planned to be randomized to dupilumab or placebo with at least 690 patients 
with a baseline blood eosinophil count ≥0.3 Giga/L and with approximately 84 adolescent patients. A protocol 
amendment limited the recruitment of patients on medium dose of ICS to approximately 819 to ensure at 
least 50% patients on a high dose of ICS. 
Main Inclusion criteria 
Adults and adolescent patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma for ≥12 months (based on the GINA 
2014 Guidelines) were eligible if they met the following criteria:

Treatments 
Dupilumab/ Placebo 
All dupilumab doses were administered by SC injection once every 2 weeks. Patients were randomized to 1 of 
the following treatment groups: 
•  Dupilumab 200mg q2w (1.14 mL) after a 400 mg loading dose 
•  Dupilumab 300 mg q2w (2 mL) after a 600 mg loading dose 
•  Placebo matched to dupilumab 200 mg (1.14 mL) q2w after a loading dose (2 x 1.14 mL) 
•  Placebo matched to dupilumab 300 mg (2.0 mL) q2w after a loading dose (2 x 2.0 mL) 
Two injections of dupilumab (or placebo) were administered on Day 1 at Visit 2 as a loading dose. 
Subsequently, one injection was to be given every 14 ± 3 days (q2w). 
Dose-ranging study DRI12544 randomized patients to 1 of 4 dupilumab regimens: 200 mg q4w, 300 mg 
q4w, 200 mg q2w, 300 mg q2w, or placebo. The results showed that treatment with dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
and dupilumab 200 mg q2w resulted highest improvements in FEV1 of all tested doses at Week 12 and a 
reduction by approximately 70% in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations compared to placebo. Both 
doses provided generally comparable efficacy.

Background treatment 
The permitted asthma controllers for the study included the following 5 classes: ICS, LABA, LAMA, anti-
leukotrienes and methylxanthines. Controller medication was not dispensed or supplied by the Sponsor.  
Randomized treatment period: 
Patients were required to continue their controller medication(s) at the same dose and regimen as used 
during the screening period. A transient increase in dose of ICS in addition to reliever/rescue medication was 
allowed to treat acute symptoms of asthma as per Investigator's guidance. The rescue medication was used 
as needed for symptom control. All use of controller and rescue medications was to be documented by the 
patient in an electronic diary. 
Post-treatment period:  
All patients continued treatment with the controller medication regimen and dose used during the randomized 
treatment period, which was adjusted as needed, based on the medical judgment of the Investigator. 
Reliever/rescue medication 
Patients were allowed to administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol MDI as reliever 
medication as needed during the study except during the 6 hour period prior to spirometry measurements.

Sample size 
Assuming the number of severe asthma exacerbations follows a negative binomial distribution with a 
dispersion parameter of 2, the placebo annualized rate of exacerbations being 0.6, a randomization ratio of 
2:2:1:1, with 1638 randomized patients (546 for each dupilumab dose and 273 for each matching placebo 
group), the study would have 99% power to detect a 55% relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.27 
for the dupilumab group) at α=0.05 (2-sided).  
Assuming a common SD of 0.5 L, 1638 patients would provide 98% power to detect a treatment difference of 
0.15 L in the change of FEV1 from baseline at week 12 for the overall population.  
A further 220 patients were randomized in order to have additional patients treated with the drug product 
manufactured using the intended commercial process. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 2:2:1:1 to receive dupilumab 200 mg (in 1.14 mL) every 2 weeks (Q2W) with a 
400 mg loading dose, dupilumab 300 mg (in 2 mL) Q2W with a 600 mg loading dose, placebo Q2W in 1.14 
mL, or placebo Q2W in 2 mL. Due to the different volumes administered two matching placebos were 
required for this study. The permitted asthma controllers for the study included the following 5 classes: ICS, 
LABA, LAMA, anti-leukotrienes and methylxanthines. Patients were allowed to administer 
albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol MDI as reliever medication as needed during the study 
except during the 6 hour period prior to spirometry measurements. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients and investigators were blinded to the study treatment (dupilumab or placebo), but not to the 
dose/volume of the injection (200 mg/1.14 mL; 300 mg/2.0 mL). 
Statistical methods 
The ITT population (all randomized patients) was the primary efficacy analysis population. 
The 1st primary parameter, annualized rate of severe exacerbation events was analysed by means of a 
negative binomial regression model with treatment, age, region (pooled country), baseline eosinophil 
stratum, baseline ICS dose level and number of severe exacerbation events within 1 year prior to the study 
as covariates and log-transformed duration of observation as offset variable. In this analysis, off-treatment 
measurements of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment were included in the analysis, including 
all severe exacerbation events up to visit 18 (week 52), regardless of whether the patient was on treatment 
or not, and the observation duration was defined as from randomization to visit 18. Estimates for treatment 
effects, corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were derived by comparing each 
dupilumab group vs. its matching placebo group separately. 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 54/161 
  
  
  
•  An analysis to assess the efficacy of dupilumab in patients who adhered to the treatment as directed 
was conducted.  
•  Analyses to examine whether the loading dose has any confounding effect over the entire treatment 
period included analyses of severe asthma exacerbation events excluding the first 4 week and also 
the first 12 weeks of randomization. Additionally, only on-treatment events (ie, those that occurred 
before or on the last dose date + 14 days) were included to avoid possible confounding effect due to 
off-treatment data. 
The 2nd primary parameter, absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12 was analysed using a MMRM 
approach including treatment, age, sex, baseline height, region (pooled country), baseline eosinophil 
stratum, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 value, 
and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates. Within-patient errors were modelled via an unstructured 
correlation matrix. For patients who discontinued IMP before week 12, additional off-study treatment pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 values measured up to week 12 were included in the primary analysis. Differences in the 
least squares (LS) mean change from baseline with the corresponding 95% CI and p-value with Kenward-
Roger adjustment were provided for comparison of each dupilumab group with its matching placebo. 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses: 
•  To assess the treatment effect when patients adhere to the study treatment as directed, on 
treatment prebronchodilator FEV1 measurements were analyzed using an MMRM model similar to the 
primary analyses. A prebronchodilator FEV1 value was considered as on-treatment if measured 
before or on the last dose date + 14 days. 
•  Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids was prohibited by protocol, except for treatment of 
asthma exacerbation. Two sensitivity analyses were performed with different methods of handling 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements confounded by systemic corticosteroid use. The 2 censoring 
methods were applied to both the primary and on-treatment analyses. 
For both primary parameter, the number of patients with missing data, reasons for and timing of patient 
withdrawals was summarized and examined for patterns across treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses 
including pattern mixture modeling-multiple imputation (PMM-MI), control-based PMM-MI, and tipping point 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the conclusion of the main model.  
For both primary efficacy parameters pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted in order to assess the 
consistency of treatment effects. 
The same method as for absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was applied to 
analyse the key secondary endpoints, percent change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12, 
and PEF, FEF25-75%, FVC, and post-bronchodilator FEV1. 
Change from baseline in ACQ-5 and AQLQ at week 24 were analyzed using an MMRM approach. In addition a 
responder analysis was performed for ACQ-5, ACQ-7, and AQLQ global scores at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52, 
using logistic regression models. 
The rate of post-bronchodilator change in FEV1 over time (termed as FEV1 slope) was compared between 
each dupilumab dose against its matching placebo using a linear mixed-effects model. 
Annualized rate of LOAC events and annualized rate of severe exacerbation events resulting in hospitalization 
or emergency room visit during the 52-week placebo-controlled treatment period were analyzed in a manner 
similar to the analysis for the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 55/161 
  
  
  
A Cox regression model was used to assess treatment differences in time to event variables. The model 
included treatment, age, region (pooled country), baseline eosinophil stratum, baseline ICS dose level, and 
number of severe exacerbation events within 1 year prior to the study as covariates. 
To strongly control the type-I error rate for the primary family of hypotheses (two primary endpoints and two 
doses), a hierarchical testing procedure was defined, i.e., each hypothesis was formally tested only if the 
preceding one is significant at the 2-sided 5% level: 
1)  annualized severe exacerbation rate for 300 mg q2w versus placebo,  
2)  absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12 for 300 mg q2w versus placebo,  
3)  annualized severe exacerbation rate for 200 mg q2w versus placebo,  
4)  absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at week 12 for 200 mg q2w versus placebo. 
Results 
Participant flow 
1897 randomized and treated patients as of the cut-off date (29 July 2017), 1434 patients completed the 
treatment, 235 patients had treatment ongoing, and 228 patients discontinued treatment. Each of the 235 
patients with ongoing treatment had completed at least 47 weeks of the 52-week treatment period at the 
time of the data cut-off date. Among the 1434 patients who completed the study treatment as of the cut-off 
date, most (1317 [91.8%] patients) continued into the open-label extension study LTS12551 (873 patients in 
the combined dupilumab group and 444 patients in the combined placebo group). Of the 107 randomized and 
treated adolescent patients as of the cut-off date, 72 adolescents completed treatment, 22 adolescents had 
treatment ongoing, and 13 adolescents discontinued treatment.

Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
Eight local and global amendments were made to the study protocol, most occurring after the first patient 
entered the study. The amendments are adequate and it is unlikely that they have impacted the results of 
the study.  
Most deviations were balanced across the treatment groups. It is unlikely that they have impacted the overall 
outcome of the study. 
Baseline data 
Overall, the baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment groups in the randomized 
population. The mean age of the randomized population was 47.9 years with a range of 12 to 84 years, while 
the mean age of the adolescent population was 14.2 years with a range of 12 to 17 years. 62.9% were 
females, 5.6% were adolescents and 82.9% were White, with Asian and Black representing 11.7% and 4.2%, 
respectively. The mean age at onset of asthma was 27.0 years, with 37.0% having asthma onset prior to age 
18 years. In the adolescent population the mean age at onset of asthma in this population was 5.0 years.

51.5% were on high dose ICS at baseline, 47.7% were on medium dose ICS (plus 1 or 2 additional 
controllers), and 0.8% of patients were on low dose ICS (in violation of the protocol). In adolescents 75.7% 
were on medium dose and 24,3% were on high dose ICS at baseline. The majority of patients (82.3%, 
adolescents 96,3%) had an ongoing atopic medical condition.

Baseline biomarkers 
Baseline biomarkers associated with Type 2 inflammation including blood eosinophils, serum total IgE, serum 
ECP, serum periostin, serum TARC, and FeNO were generally similar across treatment groups. 
Consistent with the assumption used in the sample size calculation, overall 831 (43.7%) patients across all 
treatment groups had baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L. Mean eosinophil count at baseline was 
0.36 Giga/L, with a median of 0.26, and was balanced across treatment groups. Mean FeNO was 34.97 ppb, 
and median FeNO was 25.0 ppb, which was elevated relative to the median FeNO for healthy subjects (16 
ppb) (38). Mean total IgE at baseline was 432.40 IU/mL, with a median of 167.0 IU/mL, and was balanced 
across treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
The randomized population and the ITT population were comprised of 1902 patients (1264 patients in the 
combined dupilumab group and 638 patients in the combined placebo group). Five patients were randomized 
but did not receive treatment (3 in the dupilumab and 2 in the placebo groups). In addition, 2 patients 
randomized to the 1.14 mL placebo group received single doses of dupilumab 200 mg q2w and dupilumab 
300 mg q2w, and were accordingly included in the respective dupilumab treatment arms of the safety 
population and 1 patient randomized to the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group received a single dose of 200 mg 
q2w and was accordingly included in the 200 mg q2w treatment arm of the safety population.  
Thereby, a total of 1897 patients made up the safety population (1263 patients in the combined dupilumab 
group and 634 patients in the combined placebo group).  
The PK population was comprised of 1262 patients from the safety population (1260 patients in the combined 
dupilumab group and 2 patients in the combined placebo group) with at least 1 non-missing result for 
functional dupilumab concentration in serum.  
The ADA population was comprised of 1881 patients from the safety population (1251 patients in the 
combined dupilumab group and 630 patients in the combined placebo group) who had at least 1 non-missing 
ADA result (either ‘ADA negative’ or ‘ADA positive’) after the first dose of IMP.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints 
• 
The adjusted annualized event rate of severe exacerbation in the ITT population during the 52-week 
treatment period was lower in the 2 dupilumab dose groups compared with their respective placebo 
groups (0.456 and 0.524 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups compared with 
0.871 and 0.970 for the matching placebo groups). The dupilumab versus placebo relative risk in 
both dose groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001), indicating a 47.7% and 46.0% reduced risk 
of severe exacerbation events with 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dupilumab treatment, respectively, 
compared with matching placebo.

•  An increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 for the ITT population was observed 
in the 200 mg q2w group (LS mean 0.32 L) and 300 mg q2w group (LS mean 0.34 L) compared with 
the matching placebo groups (0.18 L and 0.21 L, respectively). The LS mean difference in absolute 
change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in the dupilumab dose groups versus 
placebo was statistically significant for both the 200 mg q2w (0.14 L, p<0.0001) and 300 mg q2w 
(0.13 L, p<0.0001) treatment groups.

Secondary endpoints 
The Key secondary endpoint showed consistent results with the primary endpoint, dupilumab at 200 mg q2w 
or 300 mg q2w significantly increased the percent change from baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 
compared with matching placebo treatment, with no meaningful difference observed between the 2 
dupilumab dose groups. The LS mean percent change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 
for the ITT population was 21.34% for dupilumab 200 mg q2w, 23.08% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w, and 
12.11% and 13.67% for matching placebo, respectively. When compared with matching placebo, the LS 
mean difference was 9.23% for dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 9.41% for dupilumab 300 mg q2w. The 
difference was statistically significant for dupilumab 300 mg q2w (p<0.0001). Due to the hierarchy break, the 
treatment effect for the 200 mg q2w dose was highly, but only nominally significant (nominal p<0.0001). The 
improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was rapid (onset of a difference was observed as early as Week 2) 
and sustained over 12 weeks. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 64/161 
 
  
  
  
In the population of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L an increase in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 was observed in the 200 mg q2w (LS mean 0.43 L) and 300 
mg q2w groups (LS mean 0.47 L) compared with the matching placebo groups (0.21 L and 0.22 L, 
respectively). Statistical significance was demonstrated for the comparison of the 300 mg q2w group to the 
matching placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: 0.24 L, p<0.0001) with nominal significance 
demonstrated for the comparison of the 200 mg q2w group to the matching placebo group (0.21 L, nominal 
p<0.0001). The adjusted annualized event rate of severe exacerbation during the 52-week treatment period 
was lower in the 2 dupilumab dose groups compared with their respective placebo groups (0.370 and 0.403 
for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups compared with 1.081 and 1.236 for the matching 
placebo groups). The risk reduction was 65.8% and 67.4% for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w 
groups, respectively, compared with the matching placebo groups. Statistical significance was demonstrated 
for the 300 mg q2w group (p<0.0001) with nominal significance demonstrated for the 200 mg q2w group 
(nominal p<0.0001). There was no meaningful difference in the treatment effect on severe exacerbation 
between the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dose groups. 
In the population of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L an increase in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 was observed in the 200 mg q2w (LS mean 0.36 L) and 300 
mg q2w groups (LS mean 0.37 L) compared with the matching placebo groups (0.18 L and 0.22 L, 
EMA/188111/2019

respectively). Statistical significance was demonstrated for the comparison of the 300 mg q2w group to the 
matching placebo group (LS mean difference versus placebo: 0.15 L, p<0.0001). The adjusted annualized 
event rate of severe exacerbation during the 52-week treatment period was lower in the 2 dupilumab dose 
groups compared with their respective placebo groups (0.445 and 0.434 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 
300 mg q2w groups compared with 1.007 and 1.081 for the matching placebo groups). The risk reduction 
was 55.8% and 59.8% for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with 
the matching placebo groups. 
In the population with baseline blood eosinophils <0.3 Giga/L an increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
from baseline to Week 12 was observed in the 200 mg q2w (LS mean 0.23 L) and 300 mg q2w groups (LS 
mean 0.22 L) compared with the matching placebo groups (0.15 L and 0.18 L, respectively). Nominal 
significance was demonstrated for the comparison of the 200 mg q2w group to the matching placebo group 
(LS mean difference versus placebo: 0.08 L, nominal p=0.0242) with a smaller difference observed for the 
comparison of the 300 mg q2w group to the matching placebo group (0.04 L, nominal p=0.2511). A 
statistically significant difference was not observed in the adjusted annualized event rate of severe 
exacerbation during the 52-week treatment period between the 2 dupilumab dose groups compared with 
their respective placebo groups (0.512 and 0.610 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups 
compared with 0.675 and 0.732 for the matching placebo groups). The risk reduction was 24.1% and 16.6% 
for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with the matching placebo 
groups. 
An alternative analysis of the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events in patients by baseline blood 
eosinophil level was conducted using the following baseline blood eosinophil counts: <0.15 Giga/L, ≥0.15 to 
<0.3 Giga/L, ≥0.3 to <0.5 Giga/L, ≥0.5 Giga/L. The magnitude of the treatment effect at both dose levels 
increased with higher baseline blood eosinophil counts. Of note, the rate of severe exacerbation events in the 
population of patients with baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L was low across all treatment groups 
(0.472 and 0.737 for the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups and 0.511 and 0.642 for the matching 
placebo groups). 
Response by baseline FeNO level:  
In a prespecified analysis from Study EFC13579, patients with baseline FeNO levels 25-50 ppb and ≥50 ppb 
had a significantly better clinical response by exacerbation reduction and FEV1 improvement compared to 
placebo regardless of baseline blood eosinophils (Figure 3 and Figure 4). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 66/161 
 
  
  
  
The magnitude of response increased for subgroups with increasing baseline FeNO levels.  
Quadrant analysis:  
A post hoc analysis was conducted to examine the interaction between these baseline biomarkers, evaluating 
subgroups of patients with elevations in either one of these biomarkers compared with those who did not 
have an elevation in either biomarker and those who had elevations in both.

The greatest effect of dupilumab on annualized severe exacerbation event rate was observed among the 
patients with baseline eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb. These patients (41.7% of the ITT 
population) showed a risk reduction of 68.2% for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 65.3% for the 300 mg q2w 
group compared with placebo.  
Patients with baseline eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb, (19.9% of the ITT population) had very 
low rates of exacerbation in this study and showed no reduction in the rate of severe exacerbation with 
dupilumab compared to placebo (4.2% and -34.6% risk reduction for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 
mg q2w groups compared with the matching placebo groups). 
Patients who had an elevation in either one or the other of these biomarkers at baseline showed a clinically 
meaningful reduction in the rate of severe exacerbation compared with the placebo. Patients with baseline 
eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb (8.5% of the ITT population) showed a risk reduction of 39.2% 
for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 36.3% for the 300 mg q2w group compared with placebo.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 69/161 
 
  
  
  
Patients with baseline eosinophil ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb (29.9% of the ITT population) showed a 
risk reduction of 33.0% and 47.2% for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups compared with 
the matching placebo groups. 
Summary of treatment effect on change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (L) at Week 12 by 
subgroups defined by baseline blood eosinophil (<0.15 and ≥0.15 Giga/L) and FeNO (ppb) – ITT population 
The greatest effect of dupilumab on change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 
observed among the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb. This population 
of patients (41.7% of the ITT population) showed an LS mean difference of 0.26 L for the dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w and 0.26 L for the 300 mg q2w groups compared with placebo. 
In comparison, patients with baseline eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb, (19.9% of the ITT 
population) showed a smaller change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (LS mean

difference of 0.04 L and 0.08 L for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, 
compared with the matching placebo groups). 
Patients with baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb (8.5% of the ITT population) 
showed an LS mean difference in change from baseline of 0.07 L and 0.12 L for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w 
and 300 mg q2w groups compared with the matching placebo groups. Patients with baseline blood eosinophil 
≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb (29.9% of the ITT population) showed an LS mean difference in change 
from baseline of 0.06 L and 0.01 L for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups compared with 
the matching placebo groups.  
AQLQ and ACQ-5 ITT population: 
In the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups AQLQ global scores at Week 24 were higher 
(indicating better health-related quality of life) compared with the matching placebo groups. LS mean 
differences versus placebo for the change from baseline in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w 
groups were 0.20 (nominal p=0.0039)  and 0.15 (nominal p=0.0298), respectively. 
A decrease in ACQ-5 score was observed in the dupilumab dose groups (The LS mean change from baseline 
at Week 24 for the ITT population was -1.44 for dupilumab 200 mg q2w, -1.40 for dupilumab 300 mg q2w, 
and -1.10 and -1.21 for matching placebo, respectively). When compared with matching placebo, ACQ-5 
scores at Week 24 showed a greater reduction in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups 
compared with the matching placebo groups. 
The absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 24, 36, 52 showed that 
improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was rapid (onset of a difference was observed as early as Week 2) 
and sustained through Week 52. The LS mean change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 52 
was 0.36 L and 0.35 L in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with 
0.16 L and 0.22 L in the matching placebo groups, resulting in an LS mean difference versus matching 
placebo of 0.20 L (p<0.0001) and 0.13 L (p<0.0001). 
Absolute mean change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in adolescents: 
A greater increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 for the adolescent population was 
observed in the 200 mg q2w group (LS mean 0.40 L) and 300 mg q2w group (LS mean 0.46 L) compared 
with the matching placebo groups (0.03 L and 0.18 L, respectively). 
2.5.2.2.  EFC13691 (VENTURE) 
Objective/Methods 
Study EFC13691 (Venture) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the effect of 
dupilumab administered subcutaneously (SC) for a maximum of 24 weeks in patients with severe steroid-
dependent asthma. The study assessed the corticosteroid sparing effect of dupilumab in patients with severe 
steroid-dependent asthma receiving daily OCS, regardless of baseline blood eosinophil count. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 71/161 
  
  
  
Prior to the screening and throughout the Screening, Treatment, and Post-treatment periods, patients were 
to be on a stable dose of high dose ICS with a second or third controller medication (LABA, LTRA, 
theophylline, etc). During the study patients could administer albuterol/salbutamol or 
levalbuterol/levosalbutamol metered dose inhaler (MDI) as reliever medication as needed.  
Patients were treated on an outpatient basis and were stratified by optimized OCS dose at Week 0 (≤10 
mg/day, >10 mg/day) and country.  
The total duration of the study (per patient) was expected to be up to 44 weeks (or up to 46 weeks to allow 
for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization in patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during 
the OCS optimization phase that required a change in OCS dose) and consisted of 3 periods:  
The screening period was the OCS optimization period up to 10 weeks. Prednisone or prednisolone were 
the only OCS to be used in this study. During the Screening visit, patients currently using other OCS 
medications were switched to either of these corticosteroids at a dose clinically comparable to their current 
stable OCS dose. To optimize the OCS dose during this phase, investigators were instructed to adjust the 
OCS dose weekly according to a pre-specified titration schedule, based on changes in patient’s asthma 
control, and their clinical judgment. The lowest effective OCS dose was defined during this phase as the 
lowest dose a patient can tolerate without experiencing an increase in ACQ-5 of at least 0.5, a severe asthma 
exacerbation or a clinically significant event that required treatment by an OCS dose adjustment.  
Randomisation 
At the beginning of the 24 week treatment period  patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
dupilumab as a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg once every 2 weeks (q2w) or matching 
placebo. This period consisted of 3 Phases, a 4 week induction phase with stable (optimized) OCS dose, 
followed by a 16 week reduction phase with down-titration of OCS following a predetermined schedule and 
only if the patient did not meet any of the predefined criteria that would prohibit dose reduction, followed by 
a maintenance phase of 4 weeks in which patients were to be maintained on the same OCS dose established 
at Week 20. This period was followed by the post-treatment period of 12 weeks. 
Study participants  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 72/161 
 
  
  
  
Approximately 180 patients were planned to be randomized to either dupilumab 300 mg q2w or placebo in a 
1:1 ratio. Enrolment of patients with blood eosinophils (count of <0.15 Giga/L) was limited to approximately 
25% of total sample size to obtain a study population that would be representative of the target population. 
In addition, patients whose optimized OCS dose was 5 mg/day at randomization were limited to 
approximately 30% of the study population. 
Main Inclusion criteria 
•  Adult and adolescents patients with a physician diagnosis of severe asthma for ≥12 months, based on 
the GINA 2014 Guidelines 
•  Well-documented, regular prescribed treatment of maintenance systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 
or equivalent of 5 to 35 mg) in the 6 months prior to Screening Visit and using a stable OCS dose (ie, 
no change of OCS dose) for 4 weeks prior to Screening Visit. 
• 
Existing treatment with high dose ICS in combination with a second controller (ie, LABA, LTRA) for at 
least 3 months with a stable dose of ICS for ≥1 month prior to screening Visit; patients requiring a 
third controller were also eligible. 
• 
Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤ 80% of predicted normal for adults and ≤ 90% of predicted normal for 
adolescents prior to randomization 
•  Reversibility of at least 12% and 200 mL in FEV1 after the administration of 200 to 400 μg (2 to 4 
puffs of salbutamol) before randomization or documented in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 OR 
•  Airway hyper responsiveness (methacholine: provocative concentration that causes a positive 
reaction [PC20] of <8 mg/mL) documented in the 12 months prior to Screening Visit. 
Exclusion criteria 
 A patient who experiences a severe asthma exacerbation (defined as a deterioration of asthma that results 
in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with systemic steroids at least twice 
their current dose for at least 3 days) within 4 weeks before Visit 1.210 patients were enrolled (103 patients 
in the dupilumab group and 107 patients in the placebo group). The demographic and baseline characteristics 
were generally similar between treatment groups with a mean age of 51.3 years and 60.5% were female 
patients. Although adolescent patients were eligible according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria only 2 
patients <18 years were enrolled. The patients’ disease characteristics at baseline were also generally similar 
between dupilumab and placebo groups. All patients received background asthma controller therapy at stable 
doses at study entry in addition to a stable dose of OCS. No relevant differences are seen in the use of the 
non-ICS controllers at randomization between treatment groups. For most of the days (85.64% days in the 
dupilumab group and 87.47% days in the placebo group) patients were compliant with the prescribed OCS 
dosing and the compliance with administration of the IMP was high (>98%). 
Treatments 
Investigational treatment: 
Patients were to receive q2w SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 
1, or placebo during the 24-week Treatment period. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 73/161 
  
  
  
Dupilumab or placebo was supplied as one glass pre-filled syringe packed in a patient kit box. Both the glass 
pre-filled syringe and box were packaged in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the 
labelling was in accordance with local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
Oral corticosteroids 
Screening period/OCS optimization phase: At the Screening visit, patients currently using other forms of 
maintenance OCS were switched to either prednisone or prednisolone at a dose clinically comparable to their 
current stable OCS maintenance dose. 
The lowest effective or optimized OCS dose was defined during this phase as the lowest dose a patient could 
tolerate without experiencing any of the following OCS optimization phase interruption criteria: 
•  An increase in ACQ-5 of ≥0.5 from the last ACQ-5 score 
•  A severe asthma exacerbation 
•  A clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that required treatment by OCS dose 
adjustment 
No change in OCS dose was to be made at the Screening visit (Visit 1). One week later at Visit 2 and weekly 
throughout the optimization phase, patient stability was to be assessed by the above OCS optimization phase 
interruption criteria. If at each visit, the patient’s asthma status remained controlled (ie, none of the above 
criteria were met), the Investigator was to down titrate the patient’s OCS dose. If they remained stable 
without meeting any of the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria, they were eligible for randomization. 
Induction phase: During the 4-week induction phase patients remained on their optimized dose of OCS along 
with their baseline asthma medications. 
Oral corticosteroid reduction phase: The OCS dose was to be down-titrated following a predetermined 
schedule. Dose reductions were to occur every 4 weeks to minimize carryover effects from the previous dose 
and minimize the risk for clinically significant events. The last possible dose reduction could occur at Week 
20. 
Maintenance phase: The OCS dose established at Week 20 was not to be further reduced during the last 4 
weeks of the randomized treatment period. However, if any of the OCS reduction phase interruption criteria 
were met, the Investigator was to decide whether to maintain or increase the current OCS dose by 1 step. 
Eligible patients completing the treatment period were offered the opportunity to roll over into a long-term 
open-label extension study. 
Inhaled corticosteroid with a second or third controller 
Prior to and during the Screening period, patients were to be on a stable dose of high dose ICS with a second 
controller medication (LABA, LTRA, theophylline, etc.). Patients requiring a third controller for their asthma 
were considered eligible for this study, also to be used for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month 
prior to Screening. During the Randomized Treatment period and Post-treatment period (for those patients 
not rolling over into a long term study), patients were to continue taking their controller medication(s). 
Reliever medication 
Patients could administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol metered dose inhaler (MDI) as 
reliever medication as needed during the study. Nebulizer solutions could be used as an alternative delivery 
method.

Objectives 
Primary: 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab, compared with placebo, for 
reducing the use of maintenance OCS in patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma. 
Secondary: 
Secondary objectives of the study included: 
•  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab 
•  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in improving patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
•  To evaluate dupilumab systemic exposure and the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA). 
Endpoints/outcomes 
The primary endpoint was the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline 
dose, while maintaining asthma control. Key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 
reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared with baseline at Week 24, while maintaining asthma 
control. Other secondary endpoints were e.g. absolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the 
baseline dose while maintaining asthma control and proportion of patients achieving a reduction of OCS dose 
to <5 mg at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control. 
Sample size 
While initially 150 patients (75 per group) were to be included into the trial this was changed with 
amendment 4 (dated 30-Jan-2017) to include 180 patients (90 per group). It was calculated that for the 
primary endpoint (percentage reduction of OCS dose at week 24 compared with the baseline dose), assuming 
a common SD of 50%, with 90 patients per group, the study had 94% power to detect a treatment difference 
of 27% at the 2-tailed significance level of α=0.05. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dupilumab 300 mg q2w or placebo q2w. 
Randomization was stratified by the optimized OCS dose (≤10 mg/day and >10 mg/day) at the 
randomization visit and by country. 
Blinding (masking) 
Dupilumab and placebo were provided in matching glass syringes. 
Statistical methods 
The primary estimand is the treatment difference between dupilumab and control in the mean percentage 
reduction of OCS dose at week 24 while maintaining asthma control of all patients in the ITT population of all 
randomized patients no matter whether the patients discontinue treatment before week 24 or not.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 75/161 
 
  
  
  
Change from baseline in FEV1 was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates 
treatment, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level 
subgroups (<0.15 Giga/L, ≥0.15 Giga/L). The treatment difference was tested at α=0.05 (2-sided), 
treatment effects were described by LS means including their 95%-CI.  Patients who permanently 
discontinued the study medication were encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits, and 
the Investigator was to continue OCS dose adjustment after treatment discontinuation, as guided by their 
medical judgment. These data collected after treatment discontinuation was included in the primary analysis. 
For patients who discontinued the study the primary missing data handling approach was pattern mixture 
model by multiple imputation (PMM-MI).  
To assess the robustness of this analysis several sensitivity and supportive analyses were performed: 
•  Sensitivity analyses including control-based PMM-MI, worse of the last two observations carried 
forward, and tipping point analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the conclusion of the 
main model.  
• 
If the normality assumption was not met, rank ANCOVA with the extended Mantel-Haenszel (MH) 
statistics was used for nonparametric comparisons between treatment groups. The same covariates 
in the main ANCOVA model were adjusted for in this method.  
•  The percentage reduction of OCS dose at week 24 was classified into five ordinal categories: ≥90%, 
75-<90%, 50-<75%, >0-<50%, no reduction or any increase in OCS dose or dropped out from 
study. The model used the endpoint category as the response variable, and adjusted for the same 
covariates in the main ANCOVA model.  
• 
For patients who permanently discontinued treatment but continued in the study for remaining visits, 
data collected after treatment discontinuation were excluded from the on treatment analysis. The 
main statistical model was used. Then the primary missing data handling approach, PMM-MI, was 
applied to impute missing data and estimate the LS means by the treatment groups and difference in 
the LS means. 
•  The consistency of treatment effects across pre-specified subgroups was assessed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  
The key secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS 
dose at week 24 compared with baseline and the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of OCS dose to 
<5 mg/day at week 24 were analysed using a logistic regression model adjusted for the same covariates as 
the main ANCOVA model was used.  
For the 2 key secondary efficacy endpoints, the primary missing data handling approach used the imputed 
datasets from the primary missing data handling approach for the primary efficacy endpoint, and the binary 
response status of each patient with missing endpoint was determined from the imputed percent reduction at 
week 24.  
The absolute reduction of OCS dose at week 24 was analysed using an ANCOVA model in the same manner 
as for the primary endpoint. The imputed datasets generated from the primary missing data handling 
approach for the primary efficacy endpoint were used. 
Multiplicity control 
If the primary endpoint met the significance level (5%, 2-sided), the following secondary endpoints were 
tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level in the following order (in case of a non-significant result the 
procedure had to stop):

Results 
Participant flow  
A total of 390 adult and adolescent patients signed the written informed consent and were screened for study 
eligibility, and 210 adult and adolescent patients were enrolled, for a screen failure rate of 46.2%. The 
leading reasons for screen failure were active hepatitis or patients with positive hepatitis B or positive 
hepatitis C (Exclusion E33), enrolment/randomization stopped at the study level (Exclusion E37) and FEV1 
<80% of predicted normal for adults and ≤90% of predicted normal for adolescents during the Screening 
period, prior to randomization (Inclusion I01C). 
Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date (first patient enrolled): 15 October 2015 
Cut-off date for Clinical Study Report: 20 September 2017. 
Baseline data  
The mean age of the overall population was 51.3 years with a range of 15 to 77 years. Approximately 60.5% 
of the patients were female and 93.8% White, with Asian and Black representing 1.0% and 2.4%, 
respectively. One patient in the dupilumab group and 2 patients in the placebo group were under 18 years of 
age. 
Disease characteristics at baseline 
The mean age of onset of asthma was 31.4 years, with 76.2% having asthma onset after 18 years of age. 
71.9% had an ongoing atopic medical condition and 80.5% did not have a history of smoking. The mean 
number of severe asthma exacerbations in the prior year was 2.09 events with 1.02 of them requiring 
hospitalization or urgent medical care. Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted was 51.50%. The 
median daily OCS dose at Visit 1 (ie, pre-optimization) was 10.0 mg/day, and the median optimized daily 
OCS dose at baseline was 10.0 mg/day. Consistent with the protocol, <30% of the population were receiving 
≤5 mg/day OCS at baseline. Asthma-specific baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, 
with an overall mean pre-BD FEV1 1.58 L, mean % predicted pre-BD FEV1 of 52.18%, mean ACQ-5 score of 
2.50, and mean AQLQ global score of 4.35.

Medical/surgical history 
A patient was considered to have an ongoing atopic medical condition if he/she self-reported any of the 
following ongoing conditions: atopic dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic 
esophagitis, food allergy, hives; or had baseline total IgE ≥100 IU/mL and at least one positive aero-antigen 
specific IgE (≥0.35 IU/mL) at baseline. The percentages of patients with an ongoing atopic medical condition 
at baseline were well balanced between treatment groups. 71.9% reported having an ongoing atopic disease, 
with allergic rhinitis being the most frequent (55.7%). 50 patients (23.8%) had ongoing chronic rhinosinusitis 
and 44 patients (21.0%) had ongoing nasal polyposis. 
Prior and/or concomitant medication 
In addition to a stable dose of OCS, all patients were receiving background asthma controller therapy at 
stable doses at study entry and continued with these medications throughout the study.

Numbers analysed 
The randomized population and the ITT population were comprised of 210 adult and adolescent patients (103 
patients in the dupilumab group and 107 patients in the placebo group). All patients who were randomized 
received treatment, and all treated patients were randomized, resulting in a safety population that was 
equivalent to the randomized population (103 patients in the dupilumab group and 107 patients in the 
placebo group). The PK population was comprised of all 103 patients treated with dupilumab from the safety 
population, and the ADA population was comprised of 208 patients from the safety population who had at 
least one reportable ADA result after first dose of the study treatment. 
Summary of analysis populations - Randomized population 
The primary endpoint was percentage reduction from baseline in OCS dose at Week 24. The mean percent 
reduction in OCS dose at Week 24 was greater in the dupilumab group (LS mean 70.09) compared with the 
placebo group (LS mean 41.85). The dupilumab group showed an increasing reduction in OCS dose at each 
time point through Week 20, at which time no further dose adjustments were permitted.

The mean percent reduction in OCS dose at Week 24 was greater in the dupilumab group (LS mean 70.09) 
compared with the placebo group (LS mean 41.85). The LS mean difference in the percent reduction from 
baseline to Week 24 was statistically significant (+28.24, p<0.0001). The median percent reduction in OCS 
dose from baseline to Week 24 was 100.0% in patients who received dupilumab as compared with a 
reduction of 50.0% in the patients who received placebo.

The results of sensitivity analyses performed were similar to the results of the primary analysis. 
Secondary endpoints 
The Key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with 
baseline at Week 24, which was greater in the dupilumab group (80%) than in the placebo group (50%). The 
odds of a ≥50% reduction in the OCS dose was 3.98 times (95% CI, 2.06 to 7.67) as high with dupilumab as 
compared to placebo (p<0.0001). 
Of clinical relevance was also the secondary endpoint of the proportion of patients with a reduction in OCS 
dose to <5 mg/day at week 24, which was significantly greater in the dupilumab group (69%) than in the 
placebo group (33%). The odds of a reduction in OCS dose to <5 mg/day was 4.48 times (95% CI, 2.39 to 
8.39) as high with dupilumab as compared to placebo (p<0.0001). 
The mean absolute reduction in OCS dose at Week 24 was greater in the dupilumab group (LS mean 7.58) 
compared with the placebo group (LS mean 4.77). The LS mean difference in the percent reduction from 
baseline to Week 24 was statistically significant and clinically relevant (+2.81, p=0.0002). 
The proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with baseline was greater in the 
dupilumab group than in the placebo group across all categories of baseline blood eosinophils. The proportion 
of patients with ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with baseline was greater in the dupilumab group 
than in the placebo group across all categories of baseline FeNO. Although, higher efficacy was seen with 
higher baseline values of FeNO (e.g. <25ppb with 70.5% to >50ppb with 95.6%) and blood eosinophils (e.g. 
<0.15 with 72.5 % to >0.3 with 86.5%) the results across all subgroups are clinically meaningful.

In line with the results of the efficacy endpoints were the results of the Patient Reported Outcomes. The 
dupilumab group showed a reduction in ACQ-5 (i.e. indicating improvement in asthma control) from baseline 
to Week that was nominally greater than that observed in the placebo group. The analysis of the change from 
baseline in Asthma Quality Of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) showed an increase from baseline to week 24 that 
was greater in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Adolescents: 
In study EFC1579 and EFC13691 adolescent patients over 12 years of age with a physician diagnosis of 
asthma for ≥12 months (based on the GINA 2014 Guidelines) were eligible. 
107 adolescents were randomized in study EFC13579. The mean age of the adolescent population was 14.2 
years with a range of 12 to 17 years. Approximately one-third of the patients (35.5%) were females, and the 
majority of the patients (90.7%) were White. The majority of adolescent patients (96.3%) had an ongoing 
atopic medical condition.  
The adjusted annualized event rate of severe exacerbation in the 107 adolescent patients during the 52-week 
treatment period was lower in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group compared with the matching placebo groups 
(0.191 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w compared with 0.356 for the matching placebo group), indicating a 
46.4% reduced risk of severe exacerbation events. A difference between the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
and matching placebo group was not observed. A greater increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline 
to Week 12 for the adolescent population was observed in the 200 mg q2w group (LS mean 0.40 L) and 300 
mg q2w group (LS mean 0.46 L) compared with the matching placebo groups (0.03 L and 0.18 L, 
respectively). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 95/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
In study EFC13691 only 3 adolescent patients were enrolled (one in the dupilumab and 2 in the placebo 
group). This number is considered too low to draw any conclusions. 
Analysis performed across trials  
The applicant performed different analyses across Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579. To demonstrate 
consistency of results of Study EFC13691 were presented side-by-side. Due to differences in 
endpoints/populations it was not possible to pool all pivotal studies. 
In all studies higher efficacy was seen in patients demonstrating evidence of Type 2 inflammation, such as 
higher blood eosinophil counts at baseline or elevated baseline FeNO levels. For the subgroup of patients with 
baseline eosinophil count <0.3 Giga/L, in Study DRI12544 and EFC13691 dupilumab demonstrated 
reductions in the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in comparison to placebo, while in Study EFC13579 the 
rate of exacerbations for the dupilumab treated patients did not show a significant reduction. For FEV1, the 
treatment response was more consistent across the 3 studies with higher effect in patients with higher 
baseline eosinophil counts, and also showing improvement among patients with baseline eosinophil counts of 
either <0.3 or <0.15 Giga/L.

2.5.3.  Supportive studies 
2.5.3.1.   Study ACT11457 
Study ACT11457 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase 2a study 
comparing 300 mg SAR231893/REGN668 to placebo administered (SC) once weekly for 12 weeks in patients 
with persistent moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma. 
A relative reduction of 87% in the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with asthma exacerbations 
was observed during treatment SAR231893 (5.8%) compared with placebo (44.2%). The odds ratio was 
0.077 (p<0.0001). The efficacy of SAR231893 in reducing the incidence of asthma exacerbations was 
independent of the specific subgroups examined, i.e. no significant interactions between treatment and 
subgroups were observed. Statistically significant differences favouring the dupilumab treatment group 
versus placebo were also observed for lung function parameters as measured by FEV1 and morning PEF, as 
well as ACQ-5 symptom scores and albuterol use. Positive trends were observed for nocturnal awakenings 
and a statistically significant improvement was also observed for the SNOT-22 score. Within the dupilumab 
group, a sustained improvement versus baseline was observed during the course of the study for all 
parameters, despite LABA and ICS withdrawal. 
2.5.3.2.  Study LTS12551  
Study LTS12551 (TRAVERSE) is single-arm open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating dupilumab in 
patients with asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab asthma clinical study up to 96-week duration. 
Although the primary objective of the study is safety, the assessment of long-term efficacy is a secondary 
objective. The dupilumab dose tested in this study is 300 mg q2w. The approximate sample size (based on 
the size of the parent studies) is 2206 patients. At the time of the data cut-off date for this interim analysis, 
only patients from the DRI12554 study were rolled over to this study. The interim clinical study report is 
being written to support the safety database (see safety part of this report).  
The effect of dupilumab on contributing to a low event rate of severe asthma exacerbation was sustained 
over the treatment period in the OLE study. 
Overall, 1538 (83.4%) patients who participated from these 2 studies had no asthma exacerbation over a 
mean exposure to dupilumab of 634 days for patients enrolled from Study DRI12544 and 140 days for 
patients enrolled from Study EFC13579. The unadjusted annualized event rate was low in both the 
continuously treated or previously treated groups (dupilumab/dupilumab) and the newly treated group 
(placebo/dupilumab) in both Study DRI12544 (0.332 and 0.302, respectively) and Study EFC13579 (0.425 
and 0.311, respectively). These results confirm the sustained effect of dupilumab over time. 
For comparison with results in the OLE study, the unadjusted annualized events rates in the parent study 
EFC13691 were 1.568 for placebo and 0.646 for dupilumab 300 mg q2w. 
Overall, 122 (89.1%) patients enrolled from Study EFC13691 in the OLE study had no asthma exacerbation 
over a mean exposure to dupilumab of 141 days. The unadjusted annualized severe exacerbation event rate 
of severe asthma continued to stay low (0.313) throughout the extension study. The unadjusted annualized 
event rate was low in both the continuously treated group (dupilumab/dupilumab) and the newly treated 
group (placebo/dupilumab) (0.304 and 0.319, respectively).

FEV1 for up to 96 weeks  
For patients enrolled from Study DRI12544, patients previously on placebo during the parent study (newly 
treated group) and those previously treated with dupilumab but who had a treatment interruption for at least 
16 weeks (re-treated group), had similar FEV1 values at baseline of the 
OLE study Week 0 (1.91 L and 1.96 L, respectively). 
For patients enrolled from Study EFC13579, patients previously on placebo during the parent study (newly 
treated group) showed a marked improvement in FEV1 at Week 2 (2.06 L) as compared to baseline of the 
OLE study (1.92 L). 
In the population rolled over from Study EFC13691, a sustained improvement in lung function was also 
demonstrated.

REDUCTION IN OCS USE FOR SEVERE STEROID-DEPENDENT PATIENTS 
In patients who entered the OLE study from Study EFC13691, mean reductions in OCS dose from baseline of 
the parent study at Week 0 were 48.8% in patients previously treated with placebo and 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 103/161 
 
 
 
  
  
  
77.1% in patients previously treated with dupilumab. A further reduction in OCS dose was observed over 
time with mean reductions of 58.9% in the placebo/dupilumab group and 87.7% in the dupilumab/dupilumab 
group at Week 36. Mean reductions in OCS dose were sustained over time. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program for dupilumab in patients with asthma included three placebo-controlled 
Phase 2/3 pivotal studies (DRI12544, EFC13579 and EFC13691) with a total of 2888 patients and the long-
term extension Study LTS12251.  
Study DRI12544 was a pivotal 24-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging, Phase 
2b study in patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma to evaluate the efficacy of 4 different 
doses of dupilumab (200mg Q2W and Q4W and 300 mg Q2W and Q4W). The study consisted of 3 periods 
(Screening-, Randomized treatment and Post-treatment period) with a total duration of approximately 43 
weeks. Dupilumab was used as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroid / long-acting beta agonist 
combination therapy (ICS/LABA). Prior to screening, patients were to have been on a stable dose of 
moderate- or high-dose ICS/LABA for ≥1 month prior to Visit 1. Patients continued the stable dose of 
ICS/LABA combination product during the randomized treatment period as well as upon completion of the 
randomized treatment period. In addition, patients were allowed to administer salbutamol/albuterol or 
levosalbutamol/levalbuterol as reliever medication as needed. 
Study EFC13579 (QUEST) was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, using 
dupilumab or placebo as add-on therapy to ICS in combination with one or two other controller medicines 
(e.g., LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonists [LAMAs], LTRA, methylxanthines). Patients were required to 
be on a stable dose of medium to high dose ICS in combination with a second controller medication during 
the study. These treatments were in line with guidelines suggested medications for GINA steps 4 asthma. 
Patients were allowed to use albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol as reliever medication as 
needed. Patients were to receive dupilumab 200 mg Q2W with a 400 mg loading dose, dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W with a 600 mg loading dose or placebo Q2W. Due to the different volumes (1.14 ml and 2.0 ml) 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 104/161 
 
  
  
  
administered two matching placebos were required for this study. Randomization was stratified by age (<18 
years, ≥18 years), blood eosinophil count (<0.3 Giga/L, ≥0.3 Giga/L), ICS dose level (medium, high) and 
country at screening. The study consisted of 3 periods with a total duration of 67 to 69 weeks for each 
patient: screening (4±1 weeks), randomized treatment (52 weeks) and post-treatment follow-up (12 weeks) 
or the open-label extension study LTS12551. 
Study EFC13691(Venture) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the effect 
of dupilumab administered subcutaneously (SC) for a maximum of 24 weeks in patients with severe steroid-
dependent asthma. Prior to the screening and throughout the Screening, Treatment, and Post-treatment 
periods, patients were to be on a stable dose of high dose ICS with a second or third controller medication 
(LABA, LTRA, theophylline, etc.). The total duration of the study (per patient) was expected to be up to 44 
weeks and consisted of a Screening period/OCS Optimization phase, where investigators were instructed to 
adjust the OCS dose weekly according to a pre-specified titration schedule, a treatment period (24 weeks), 
where patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab as a 600 
mg loading dose followed by 300 mg Q2W or matching placebo. The treatment period consisted of an 
induction phase (4 weeks), a reduction phase (16 weeks) and a maintenance phase (4 weeks). In the post-
treatment period (12 weeks, for patients not rolling over into a long-term open-label extension study) 
patients continued treatment with their stable dose of OCS and controller medication that could be modified 
based on their level of asthma control, as determined by the Investigator. 
The patient population consisted of adults (all pivotal studies) and adolescents (EFC13579 and EFC13691) 
with moderate-to-severe, uncontrolled asthma despite receiving maximal standard of care treatment. All 
patients in these trials were on either medium or high dose inhaled steroids in combination with up to two 
additional controllers which typically included a long acting bronchodilator and in Study EFC13691 patients 
required chronic oral corticosteroids and high dose ICS.  
At baseline patients had significantly impaired lung function, poor asthma control and a high risk for 
exacerbations. Patients enrolled in Study EFC13691 had more significant airflow limitation despite treatment 
with daily OCS along with high dose ICS plus additional controller medication, had a mean of 2.1 severe 
asthma exacerbations in the previous year. Patients were enrolled without the requirement for a specific 
minimum threshold for biomarker (i.e. eosinophil count and FeNO). 
The pivotal studies were adequate in design, sample size and overall balanced in baseline characteristics to 
provide sufficient efficacy data for the planned indication of patients with moderate –to-severe asthma and 
patients with OCS dependent asthma. The numbers of (adult) patients providing long-term data is also 
sufficient.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-Response-Study DRI12544 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 at week 12 
(primary efficacy endpoint) of the 3 highest doses of dupilumab compared to placebo. 
The results were provided as an overall ITT population, and by subgroup baseline eosinophil counts >0.3 
Giga/L or < 0.3 Giga/L. In the HEos ITT population, the LS mean changes in FEV1 from baseline at Week 12 
were +0.18 L in the placebo group and ranged from +0.26 L (200 mg q4w dose) to +0.43 L (200 mg q2w 
dose) in the 4 dupilumab treatment groups. When compared with placebo, the LS mean differences were 
significant for dupilumab 300 mg q4w (+0.17 L; p=0.0212), 200 mg q2w (+0.26 L; p=0.0008), and 300 mg 
q2w (+0.21 L; p=0.0063). For later time point at 24 weeks the LS mean changes in FEV1 from baseline at 
Week 24 were +0.22 L in the placebo group and ranged from +0.28 L (200 mg q4w dose) to +0.38 L (200 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 105/161 
  
  
  
mg q2w dose and 300mg Q2W). In the other subgroup blood eosinophil <0.3 Giga/L the LS mean changes in 
FEV1 from baseline at 12 weeks ranged from +0.10 L placebo to 0.18 L (300mg Q4W) to +0.25L (200mg 
Q2W). At week 24, LS mean changes in FEV1 from baseline ranged from 0.09 in placebo and ranged from 
0.20 L (300mg Q4W) to 0.23L (both 200mg Q2w and 300mg Q2W). Compared to placebo the LS mean 
differences ranged from 0.10 L (300mg Q4W) to 0.14L for both 200mg q2w (p 0.0104) and 300mg Q2W (p 
0.0109). Efficacy tended to be better in subgroups of patients with atopy and elevations in Th2 biomarkers at 
baseline. Both the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg Q2W dose regimens of dupilumab demonstrated, as compared to 
placebo, a significant reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations and a delayed time to 
first severe asthma exacerbation event, during the treatment period, in all 3 populations. The majority of 
patients did not experience a severe exacerbation during treatment. In the  HEos ITT population the total 
number of severe exacerbation was lowest for the 200mg Q2W arm (29) and had the lowest relative risk 
0.567 (difference from placebo was 28). In the subgroup with low eosinophils counts (<0.3 Giga/L) overall 
there was a lower rate of severe exacerbations as the events in the placebo arm in this group was 38 
compared to 57 in the HEos ITT population the number of severe events was lower for all treatment groups 
and ranged from 10 (200mg Q2W) to 23 (300mg Q4W).  The difference from placebo ranges from 18 to 28 
respectively with relative risk 0.324 to 0.401 respectively. However the event rate was annualised as the 
duration of the study was only 24 weeks. 
Overall the study supported further investigation of the 200mg and 300mg Q2W regimens.  
Study EFC13579 had two primary endpoints: annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-
week placebo-controlled treatment period and absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at 
Week 12. 
Severe exacerbations were defined as per the CHMP guidelines (need for systemic CS, emergency room visit 
or hospitalisation due to asthma). It is agreed that this is the most important outcome in this patient 
population because they constitute the greatest risk to patients. The second primary endpoint was the 
assessment of absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12. The key secondary 
efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12. In addition a 
broad range of other secondary outcomes was used, which are standard for the evaluation of chronic asthma 
treatment including the assessment of pulmonary function, patient-reported outcomes (including Asthma 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S) at week 24) and the assessment of asthma control through the 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) at week 24. The primary endpoints and secondary endpoints were 
analysed in subgroups of patients with normal or increased baseline eosinophil level e.g. in subgroups of 
patients with baseline eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L, ≥0.15 Giga/L, <0.3 Giga/L and in subgroups of patients 
with normal or elevated FeNO level e.g. subgroups of patients with baseline FeNO < 25ppb, < 50ppb and 
>50 ppb. 
Overall 831 (43.7%) patients across all treatment groups had baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L. 
Mean eosinophil count at baseline was 0.36 Giga/L, with a median of 0.26, and was balanced across 
treatment groups. Early treatment discontinuation was balanced across treatment groups, with frequencies 
between 10.9% and 13.4%. The treatment withdrawals and their reasons were balanced between arms. The 
main reason was a patient decision.  
The primary endpoints were the reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over 52 
weeks and the change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12. Dupilumab at 200 mg q2w or 
300 mg q2w reduced the rate of severe asthma exacerbations compared with matching placebo treatment. 
The adjusted annualized event rate of severe exacerbation in the ITT population during the 52-week 
treatment period was lower in the two dupilumab dose groups compared with their respective placebo 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 106/161 
 
  
  
  
groups. While statistically significant, the treatment effect in relative terms (relative risk reduction 
approximately 46%-47% for both regimens) and absolute terms (reduction from 0.871 and 0.970 
exacerbation per year observed in the placebo group to 0.456 and 0.524 exacerbation per year in the 
treatment groups) is considered moderate from a clinical perspective. The treatment effect in the subgroup of 
patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and ≥0.3 Giga/L, was greater than that observed in the 
overall ITT. In those patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L, the relative reduction in annualized 
exacerbation rate versus placebo was 65.8% and 67.4% for the 200mg Q2W and 300mg Q2W doses, 
respectively. For the subpopulation with baseline eosinophil levels <0.15 Giga/L and <0.3 Giga/Lthe 
reduction in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations did not reach statistical significance for either dose. 
The percent risk reduction of severe exacerbation events with 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dupilumab 
treatment, respectively, compared with matching placebo for each of the baseline FeNO levels were as 
follows: 24.8% and 20.8% for the <25 ppb subgroup, 61.4% and 55.8% for the ≥25 to <50 ppb subgroup, 
and 69.2% and 69.5% for the ≥50 ppb subgroup. 
A significant increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 was observed in both dupilumab 
groups as compared to the placebo groups. The LS mean difference in absolute change from baseline to 
Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in the dupilumab dose groups versus placebo was statistically significant 
for both the 200 mg q2w (0.14 L, p<0.0001) and 300 mg q2w (0.13 L, p<0.0001) treatment groups. 
The minimal clinically important difference in FEV1 has not been rigorously established for asthma but it is 
likely that change of 100-200 ml in FEV1 can be perceived by patients as clinically important. Therefore the 
observed difference  in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 observed for the 200 mg Q2W group (0.14 L) 
and for the 300 mg Q2W group (0.13 L) in the overall ITT population over the matching placebo groups 
(p<0.0001) is likely to be clinically significant. 
Results observed in the population of patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L were consistent 
with those observed in the ITT population whereas the treatment effect in the subpopulation of patients with 
baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L was greater than that observed in the overall ITT population. On the 
other hand the effect observed in patients with baseline blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and < 0.3 Giga/L was 
lower and not statistically significant. Patients with baseline FeNO levels 25-50 ppb and ≥50 ppb had a 
significantly better clinical response by exacerbation reduction and FEV1 improvement compared to placebo 
regardless of baseline blood eosinophils. 
Consistent with the results observed for the primary endpoint, dupilumab at 200 mg q2w or 300 mg q2w 
increased the percent change from baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1, at Week 12 compared with matching 
placebo treatment (although the difference for 200 mg dose was only nominally significant). 
The improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was sustained through Week 52. The LS mean change in pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 52 was 0.36 L and 0.35 L in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 
mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with 0.16 L and 0.22 L in the matching placebo groups, resulting in 
an LS mean difference versus matching placebo of 0.20 L (p<0.0001) and 0.13 L (p<0.0001). 
A post hoc analysis was conducted to examine the interaction between the baseline biomarkers of Type 2 
inflammation, evaluating subgroups of patients with elevations in either one of these biomarkers compared 
with those who did not have an elevation in either biomarker and those who had elevations in both. 
The greatest effect of dupilumab on annualized severe exacerbation event rate was observed among the 
patients with baseline eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb, while patients with baseline eosinophils 
<0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb, had very low rates of exacerbation in this study and showed no reduction 
in the rate of severe exacerbation in either group compared to placebo. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 107/161 
  
  
  
The greatest effect of dupilumab on change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was similar 
to the exacerbation rate observed among the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO 
≥25 ppb. For this endpoint it was also demonstrated that the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with baseline 
eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb was low. 
The results of other secondary endpoints support some level of improvement in pulmonary functions on the 
dupilumab treated patients compared to placebo with no obvious differences between two dosing regimens. 
Dupilumab reduced FeNO in the population of patients with an eosinophilic phenotype to concentrations 
considered normal indicating an -effect on airway inflammation. A higher decrease in ACQ-5 scores was 
observed in the dupilumab treatment groups as comparing to the placebo groups. Although the observed 
mean difference between groups e.g -0.35 for dupilumab/placebo 200 mg q2w and dupilumab/placebo 300 
mg q2w was nominally significant, the clinical relevance of the observed differences is not clear.  
In general some level of improvements of asthma symptoms such as morning/evening asthma symptom 
score and nocturnal awakenings were observed between treatment groups. 
A difference between the dupilumab groups and matching placebo groups was not consistently apparent in 
relation to the use of daily puffs of rescue medications, in particular for the comparison between the 300 mg 
q2w group and the placebo group. In line with the ATS/ERS guidelines minimal important difference in 
relation to the use of rescue medication was established as 0.81 puffs/day. Such difference was never 
observed in the study. 
In Study EFC13691 all endpoints were met. The primary endpoint was percentage reduction from baseline in 
OCS dose at Week 24. The mean percent reduction in OCS dose at Week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 
group (LS mean 70.09) compared with the placebo group (LS mean 41.85), while the median percent 
reduction was 100 % in the dupilumab group as compared with a reduction of 50.0% in the patients who 
received placebo. The LS mean difference in the percent reduction from baseline to Week 24 was statistically 
significant (+28.24, p<0.0001). It has to be noted that following the 4-week Induction Phase, the dupilumab 
group showed increasing reduction in OCS dose at each time point though week 20 in contrast to placebo 
where the reduction plateaued after week 16. After week 20 no further dose adjustments were permitted. 
The results of sensitivity analyses performed were similar to the results of the primary analysis. The results 
of the  secondary endpoints support the results of the primary endpoint and showed, that at Week 24, the 
proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with baseline was significantly greater in 
the dupilumab group (80%) than in the placebo group (50%).  
Of clinical relevance was also the proportion of patients with a reduction in OCS dose to <5 mg/day at week 
24, which was significantly greater in the dupilumab group (69%) than in the placebo group (33%).  Similar 
were the results regarding the absolute reduction in OCS dose at Week 24. The median absolute reduction in 
OCS dose from baseline to Week 24 was 7.5 mg/day in patients who received dupilumab as compared with a 
reduction of 5.0 mg/day in the patients who received placebo.  No treatment-by-subgroup interaction was 
observed for based on baseline blood eosinophil level. A difference which is likely to favour dupilumab was 
the imbalance in the percentage of patients with baseline ACQ-5 score >2. 72% of such patients were 
randomized to the placebo group and 61% to the dupilumab group. 
In all pivotal studies a loading dose, which is a one-time doubling of the maintenance dose, was administered 
at Day 1. In Study EFC13579, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the influence of the loading 
dose on maintenance of the dupilumab treatment effect. The analyses showed that the dupilumab effects on 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 108/161 
 
  
  
  
reducing the risk of exacerbations observed early in the study (in the first 4 or 12 weeks) were well 
maintained in the later part and showed a rapid improvement in FEV1 by 2-4 weeks. Therefore, the 
administration of a loading dose to achieve more rapid target saturation is also adequate for the asthma 
indication. 
The LTS12551 (TRAVERSE) study was designed as a single-arm open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate 
the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in adult and adolescent patients with asthma who 
participated in a previous dupilumab asthma study.  The study is still ongoing. The overall mean duration of 
patient participation in the study was of 310.3 days and the overall cumulative study duration of 1566.6 
patient-years. All patients were treated with 300mg Q2W regardless of their previous doses. A critical GCP 
issue which was identified by the MAH evidence suggested that Investigational Medicinal Products kits had 
been tampered with after the discrepancy was identified. Of 10 patients recruited by the site, 4 were screen 
failures and 6 were randomized in EFC13579. The primary objective was safety however secondary objectives 
analysed severe exacerbations, FEV1, Asthma control and quality of life. The unadjusted annualized event 
rate of severe asthma exacerbation was 0.347. Most of patients who had asthma exacerbation experienced 
single episodes during the observation period. Among the 306 patients who experienced at least one event of 
severe asthma exacerbation, 29 (1.6% of the overall population) had severe asthma exacerbations that 
required hospitalization or emergency room visit; the unadjusted annualized event rate of severe 
exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency room visit was 0.021. A low annualized event rate of 
severe asthma in all patients irrespective of the ICS dose at baseline was seen. The observed annualized 
event rate of severe asthma exacerbations was lower in the subgroup of patients receiving medium ICS dose 
as compared to those receiving high ICS dose (0.254 and 0.427 in the 2 subgroups, respectively). 
Overall, 122 (89.1%) patients enrolled from Study EFC13691 and who participated in the OLE study had no 
asthma exacerbation over a mean exposure to dupilumab of 141 days. The unadjusted annualized event rate 
of severe asthma exacerbation was 0.313. Subgroup analysis based on baseline blood eosinophil counts of 
the parent studies showed a consistent low annualized event rate of severe asthma in all patients irrespective 
of the baseline counts (0.224 and 0.381 in patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥0.3 Giga/L and <0.3 Giga/L, 
respectively). 
In the overall population, a mean (SD) increase in FEV1 of +0.23 L (0.45) from baseline of the parent study 
was observed at Week 0 of the OLE study. A further improvement in FEV1 was observed at Week 2, with a 
mean (SD) increase of +0.30 L (0.44) versus baseline of the parent study. Improvement in FEV1 was 
sustained throughout the study duration. 
Subgroup analysis based on baseline blood eosinophil counts of the parent studies showed a consistent FEV1 
improvement in all patients irrespective of the baseline counts; the effect was larger in those patients with 
baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L (mean changes of +0.42 L and +0.18 L from baseline of the 
parent study at Week 24 in patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥0.3 Giga/L and <0.3 Giga/L, respectively). 
Subgroup analysis based on baseline blood eosinophil counts of the parent studies showed a consistent FEV1 
improvement with the larger effect  in those patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥0.3 Giga/L (mean 
changes of +0.59 L versus +0.14 L from baseline at Week 24: in patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥0.3 
Giga/L and <0.3 Giga/L, respectively). Even if more significant results are demonstrated in the subpopulation 
with high blood eosinophils > 0.3 Giga/L, some efficacy is also observed in patients with low blood eosinophil 
level. In conclusion, the efficacy is considered demonstrated in eosinophilic patients with high blood 
eosinophils > 0.3 Giga/L.

2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Both, the 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W doses of dupilumab, when added to standard of care to patients 
with persistent, uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma, demonstrated clinically meaningful and significant 
effects on primary endpoints and most other secondary endpoints including patient reported outcomes. 
Subgroup analyses showed higher treatment effects in patients with eosinophilic asthma or in patients 
without elevated eosinophils at baseline but with other baseline markers for a Type 2 phenotype, in particular 
FeNO. Efficacy was noted across the other analysed subgroups, including adolescents and patients with 
different levels of severity at baseline. No reduction was seen for the rate of severe exacerbations in the 
subgroup of patients with blood eosinophil count <0.15 Giga/L in study EFC13579, only a small benefit with 
regards to lung function was observed.   
Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the greatest effect of dupilumab on the rate of exacerbations and on 
the change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were seen in patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and 
FeNO ≥25 ppb, patients with elevations in either one of these biomarkers still showed clinically meaningful 
effects while patients with <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb showed no reduction on the rate of exacerbations 
and only small changes in pre-bronchodilator FEV1.  
These results demonstrate that dupilumab is most effective in patients with type 2 inflammation asthma 
characterised by raised eosinophils and/or raised FeNO to reduce the rate of annualized severe exacerbations 
and to improve the pre-bronchodilator FEV1. The results of the patients reported outcomes were in line the 
primary endpoints and showed improvement in asthma control and quality of life. Furthermore, dupilumab 
treatment resulted in a greater reduction in the need for oral corticoid-steroids in OCS dependent asthma 
patients compared to placebo.  
The applicant has conducted two trials that included subpopulations of difficult to treat asthma as 
characterized by the persistence of symptoms. The majority of patients in both trials had signs of a type 2 
inflammatory asthma when using eosinophilia and/or FeNO as biomarkers. In trial EFC13579 efficacy 
appeared to be driven by the subpopulation of patients with type 2 inflammatory asthma (defined by 
eosinophilia and FeNO) and no efficacy was observed in patients without these inflammatory characteristics.   
Patients on medium and high dose ICS were included in the asthma development program. However, as 
stated in current treatment guidelines for severe asthma a maximally optimized treatment is mandatory for 
the patient population with severe asthma, which cannot be agreed for patients with medium dose ICS. The 
applicant mentioned that there is a ceiling effect expected with ICS and other controller medications. 
However, some patients may well respond to a high dose as recommended in the asthma guidelines for at 
least 3 to 6 months, which is the next step to optimize the treatment in patients with medium dose ICS 
before escalating to systemic treatment or biologics. It has also to be noted that the studies conducted 
(DRI12544 and EFC13579) as acknowledged by the applicant did not cover the full range of medium ICS. 
Therefore, the indication wording including a population on medium ICS dose was not acceptable. The 
indication was revised accordingly to only patients with high dose ICS. 
The trial EFC13691 included patients on oral corticosteroid treatment and the majority of patients also 
presented with eosinophilia. Even though the interaction test was not positive for the biomarkers 
(eosinophilia and FeNO), the mechanism of action strongly suggests that this population is composed of 
patients with type 2 inflammation in this relatively small trial which is already covered in the above 
indication. The justification presented by the applicant for a separate part of the indication for patients on 
OCS treatment without biomarker is not sufficient to date. The applicant states in his responses that patients 
were enrolled regardless of baseline type 2 biomarkers. This cannot be fully agreed as according to the study 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 110/161 
  
  
  
report submitted, enrolment of patients in study EFC13691 with blood eosinophils (count of <0.15 Giga/L) 
was limited to approximately 25% of total sample size to obtain a study population that would be 
representative of the target population. Overall, the numbers of patients receiving dupilumab with blood 
eosinophil level <0.15 G/L were small. From the results provided it can be seen that 102 patients were 
treated with dupilumab although positive effect statistically and clinically relevant effect is seen, the majority 
of patients had Eosinophil level greater than ≥ 0,15 G/L, only 22 patients had Eos < 0,15., therefore the 
evidence for non-biomarkers is considered too uncertain. Thus a separate statement in the indication for the 
inclusion of a population only characterized by oral glucocorticoid use is not acceptable.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to dupilumab in all completed/unblinded Phase 2/3 asthma studies is provided in table 3. Overall a 
total of 2649 patients were exposed to dupilumab of which 2136, 1553, 834, and 531 patients were exposed 
for ≥6 months (24 weeks), ≥1 year, ≥1.5 years, and ≥2 years (96 weeks), respectively.

Safety pool (studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
Exposure in PY in the individual safety pool studies (EFC13579 and DRI12544) and the safety pool overall is 
provided in Table 4. The treatment period was 24 weeks in Study DRI12544 and 52 weeks in Study 
EFC13579, thus exposure is greater in Study EFC13579 due to a longer treatment period and a larger 
number of patients in the study. 
For the pooled safety population (DRI12544 and EFC13579) exposure was similar across the 3 treatment 
groups: 653.6 PY (dupilumab 200 mg q2w), 646.0 PY (dupilumab 300 mg q2w), and 661.7 PY (placebo). 
Table 3: Patient-years exposure to investigational medicinal product by study – pooled safety 
population 
The median duration of treatment exposure was the same across all treatment groups, 363 days (Table 5). 
Given that the majority of patients were 18 to 64 years of age, were Caucasian/White, and females, exposure 
to study drug treatments was highest in those categories: 18 to 64 year old age category (ranging from 
530.8 PY in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group to 545.6 PY in the placebo group); Caucasian/White patients 
(ranging from 524.2 PY in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group to 551.1 PY in the placebo group) and female 
patients (ranging from 401.8 PY in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group to 429.4 PY in the placebo group). In 
patients <18 years of age, exposure to study drug was 32.1 PY for both the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w treatment groups compared with 36.5 PY for placebo. 
Adolescents 12 to 17 
Exposure in North America ranged from 149.3 PY in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group to 157.0 PY in the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, and in the European Union exposure ranged from 81.3 PY in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group to 90.2 PY in the placebo group). Exposure for rest of world ranged from 409.0 PY in the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w group to 415.7 PY in the placebo group; rest of world includes Australia, Argentina, 
Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and 
Ukraine.

Safety pool (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
The proportion of patients who experienced any TEAE or SAE during the entire treatment period was similar 
in all treatment groups. The proportion of patients with TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
study drug was generally low, and was similar in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and placebo groups (3.2% and 
4.3%, respectively) and numerically higher in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (6.1%), mainly due to 
Injection site reactions. In the safety pool, a total of 5 patients had TEAEs leading to death reported in the 
dupilumab treatment groups (1 patient in the 200 mg q2w group and 4 patients in the 300 mg q2w group); 
3 patients had TEAEs leading to death in the placebo group. None of the deaths were considered related to

1) Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events 
Safety pool (studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
The number (%) of patients with common TEAEs (defined as TEAEs with PTs ≥2% in any treatment group) is 
provided in Table 9 When viewed at the SOC level, there were a few imbalances noted, some with a higher 
incidence of TEAEs in the dupilumab groups and others with a higher incidence in the placebo group. 
The Infections and infestations SOC had the highest proportion of patients with TEAEs. The proportion of 
patients with infections was lower in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups (56.6% and 
58.6%, respectively; 57.6% for the combined group) compared with the placebo group (63.4%). The General 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC had the second highest proportion of patients with TEAEs 
(mainly due to injection site reactions). The proportion of patients with TEAEs in this SOC was higher in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (25.1%) compared with the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group (19.9%) and the 
placebo group (14.4%). Numeric differences in the TEAEs in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC among the 
treatment groups in the pooled safety population were driven by events in Study EFC13579: 12 (1.5%) and 
18 (2.3%) patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w treatment groups, respectively, and 4 
(0.5%) in the placebo-treated group.  
Seven cases were SAEs, 2 in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 5 in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group. Of the 
30 patients, none experienced liver injury and 22 patients experienced events related to gallbladder disorders 
(eg, Cholelithiasis, Cholecystitis, acute Cholecystitis, Cholecystitis chronic, Bile duct stone, Hyperplastic 
cholecystopathy, Biliary colic). Of these, 18 were females, 12 were >40 years old, 6 reported high cholesterol 
or other dyslipidemia, and 14 had BMI >28 kg/m2. Past medical history of cholelithiasis was reported in 2 
female patients. AST/ALT were normal at the time of the event in 12 patients; >2.5 ULN in 5 patients, and 
not provided in 5 patients. 
 Alkaline phosphatase was elevated up to 2.99 x ULN in 5 patients. Serum bilirubin was normal in 15 
patients; 1.3 x ULN in 1 patient, and not available in 6 patients. Six patients received no corrective 
treatment, 10 received medical treatment and 6 received surgical procedures. One patient discontinued 
treatment due to acute cholecystitis. In the other two Phase 3 studies (ie, EFC13691 and LTS12551), TEAEs 
in the Hepatobiliary SOC were reported in 0 and 2 patients in Studies EFC13691 and LTS12551, respectively. 
There were no deaths in the hepatobiliary SOC. With longer duration of exposure to dupilumab treatment in 
the open-label extension study (LTS12551) there was no increase in TEAEs of hepatobiliary disorders over 
time. A similar imbalance between dupilumab and placebo for cholelithiasis related events was not observed 
in the AD studies. There were no observed trends in PCSAs in the relevant laboratory values.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 114/161 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The most frequently reported TEAEs with an incidence ≥5% at the PT level in any of the treatment groups 
are provided below. The PTs listed are respective to the 3 treatment groups (dupilumab 200 mg q2w, 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w, and placebo).  
• Injection site erythema (12.5%, 16.8%, and 5.9%) 
• Viral upper respiratory tract infection (17.2%, 16.1%, and 18.1%) 
• Upper respiratory tract infection (11.7%, 12.3%, and 14.4%) 
• Bronchitis (10.8%, 11.4%, and 13.3%) 
• Headache (8.1%, 7.2%, and 9.0%) 
• Injection site oedema (3.5%, 6.1%, and 1.0%) 
• Influenza (5.4%, 6.0%, and 7.1%) 
• Injection site pruritus (4.0%, 5.5%, and 1.1%) 
• Sinusitis (5.1%, 4.1%, and 8.3%) 
Consistent with any large safety database where the overall incidence of TEAEs is similar between drug and 
placebo, numeric imbalances occur in both directions. As shown, TEAEs with higher frequencies in the 
dupilumab groups compared with placebo were Injection site erythema, Injection site oedema, and Injection 
site pruritus. Upper respiratory infections, Bronchitis, Headache, and Influenza were more frequently reported 
by patients in the placebo groups.

No differences other than those noted above were observed based on exposure adjusted data.  
Treatment-emergent adverse event incidence in the dupilumab combined group was higher (≥1%) 
than the placebo group for the following PTs: Injection site erythema (14.6% versus 5.9%), Injection site 
oedema (4.8% versus 1.0%), Back pain (4.8% versus 3.7%), Injection site pruritus (4.7% versus 1.1%), 
Injection site pain (3.8% versus 2.4%), Oropharyngeal pain (3.1% versus 1.6%), Eosinophilia (2.5% versus 
0.3%), and Injection site inflammation (1.7% versus 0.1%). Treatment-emergent AE incidence in the 
placebo group was higher (≥1%) than the dupilumab combined group for the following PTs: Viral upper 
respiratory tract infection (18.1% versus 16.7%), Upper respiratory tract infection (14.4% versus 12.0%), 
Bronchitis (13.3% versus 11.1%), Headache (9.0% versus 7.7%), Sinusitis (8.3% versus 4.6%), Influenza 
(7.1% versus 5.7%), Rhinitis allergic (4.5% versus 3.0%), Urinary tract infection (4.2% versus 2.7%), 
Arthralgia (3.8% versus 2.6%), Acute sinusitis (3.4% versus 1.9%), and Nausea (2.3% versus 1.3%). 
Of the TEAEs listed above, an analysis of relative risk (dupilumab combined group versus placebo) based on 
95% confidence intervals showed that dupilumab treatment was associated with a higher relative risk of 
experiencing TEAEs of Injection site erythema  (RR=2.46; 95% CI 1.82-3.33), Injection site oedema 
(RR=4.74; 95% CI 2.30-9.77), Injection site pruritus (RR=4.16; 95% CI 2.09-8.26), Injection site 
inflammation (RR=13.65; 95% CI 1.86-100.24), Eosinophilia (RR=9.86; 95% CI 2.39-40.71), and 
Oropharyngeal pain (RR=1.91; 95% CI 1.04-3.49). Dupilumab treatment was associated with a lower 
relative risk of experiencing TEAEs of Sinusitis (RR=0.55; 95% CI 0.40-0.76) and acute sinusitis (RR=0.56; 
95% CI 0.34-0.94), and also a lower risk of Asthma in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group compared with 
placebo (RR: 0.39 (95% CI 0.16-0.93). Further information on injection site reactions and eosinophilia is 
provided below (AESIs and other select AE grouping events). Forest plots of the risk ratios (95% CI) of all 
common TEAEs (PT ≥2%) with ≥1% higher incidence in one of the groups compared to any other group for 
the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w treatment groups versus placebo are presented in Figure 2 and 
Figure 3, respectively.

24 week period in the safety pool 
The incidence and type of common TEAEs observed during the 24-week treatment period were consistent 
with those observed during the whole TEAE period. No additional safety signals were identified during the 
first 24 week treatment-emergent period of each study. 
Summary of TEAE findings 
• The proportion of patients who experienced any TEAEs during the entire treatment period (24 weeks in 
Study DRI12544 and 52 weeks in Study EFC13579) was similar in all treatment groups (range: 80.5% to 
81.4%). 
• The proportion of patients with infections was lower in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups 
(56.6% and 58.6%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (63.4%), thus suggesting that dupilumab 
treatment did not increase the overall occurrence of infections. 
• Based on an analysis of relative risk, dupilumab treatment (combined group) was associated with a higher 
risk of experiencing TEAEs of injection site reactions (erythema, edema, pruritus, and inflammation), 
eosinophilia, and oropharyngeal pain. Dupilumab treatment (combined group) was associated with a lower 
risk of experiencing TEAEs of sinusitis and acute sinusitis, and also a lower risk of Asthma in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group.

The proportion of patients with treatment-related TEAEs (relatedness assessed by the Investigator) in the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w (21.7% [169/779]) and dupilumab 300 mg q2w (24.4% [192/788]) groups was 
higher than for patients in the placebo group (14.0% [111/792]). 
The General disorders and administration site conditions SOC had the highest proportion of patients with 
treatment-related TEAEs. A higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w (15.9% [124/779]) 
and dupilumab 300 mg q2w (19.7% [155/788]) groups reported TEAEs from this SOC compared to patients 
in the placebo group (9.0% [71/792]). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs with an 
incidence ≥1% in any of the treatment groups are provided below. The PTs listed are respective to the 3 
treatment groups (dupilumab 200 mg q2w, dupilumab 300 mg q2w, and placebo). 
• injection site erythema (12.2%, 16.1%, and 5.8%) 
• injection site edema (3.5%, 5.6%, and 1.0%) 
• injection site pruritus (4.0%, 5.3%, and 1.1%) 
• injection site pain (3.3%, 3.8%, and 2.3%) 
• injection site inflammation (1.3%, 2.2%, and 0.1%) 
• headache (0.8%, 1.4%, and 0.4%) 
• eosinophilia (0.8%, 1.1%, and 0.3%) 
• injection site urticaria (0.5%, 1.1%, and 0.1%) 
In summary, treatment-related TEAEs (≥1%) that occurred with a higher frequency in the dupilumab 
treatment groups than in the placebo group were mainly injection site reactions (as listed above). None of 
the treatment-related TEAEs in the placebo group occurred with an incidence ≥1% with the exception of PTs 
of injection site reactions listed in the bullets above.  
Study EFC13691 
Most TEAEs were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to the IMP. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be related to the IMP included injection site pain (3.9% in 
the dupilumab group and 0.9% of patients in the placebo group), eosinophilia (2.9% of patients in the 
dupilumab group and 0 patients in the placebo group), injection site erythema (1.9% of patients in both 
groups), injection site edema (1.9% of patients in the dupilumab group and 0.9% of patients in the placebo 
group), headaches and nausea (each in 0.9% of patients in the dupilumab group and 1.9% of patients in the 
placebo group), pruritus and injection site bruising (each in 1.9% of patients in the dupilumab group and 0% 
of patients in the placebo group). All other related TEAEs were reported in 1 patient only. 
Study LTS12551 
Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies Most TEAEs were considered by the Investigator to 
be unrelated to the IMP. The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥2% at PT level) that were considered by the 
Investigator to be related to the IMP included injection site erythema (6.8%), injection site pain (2.3%), and 
injection site pruritus (2.0%). Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study Most TEAEs were considered by the 
Investigator to be unrelated to the IMP. The following TEAEs were considered by the Investigator to be 
related to dupilumab and were reported by a single patient each: fibroadenoma of breast, eosinophilia, 
hypersensitivity, thyroiditis, headache, tendinitis, accidental overdose, and intentional overdose; and 
injection site erythema in 2 patients. 
3) Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events in adolescents 
In Study EFC13579, the percentage of adolescent patients with at least 1 TEAE was 70.6% and 76.5% in the 
dupilumab groups (200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w, respectively) versus 76.2% and 88.9% in the matching 
placebo groups, with no apparent difference between dupilumab dose groups (Table 10). The most frequent 
TEAEs were in the SOC of infections and infestations (58.8% and 55.9% in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 
300 mg q2w groups, respectively versus 71.4% and 83.3% in the matching placebo groups), mainly due to 
viral upper respiratory tract infections (5.9% and 29.4% in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w 
groups, respectively versus 28.6% and 38.9% in the matching placebo groups). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 121/161 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs in the adolescent population was low in all treatment groups (3 
[8.8%] and 1 [2.9%] patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively versus 0 
and 2 [11.1%] patients in the matching placebo groups). PTs in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group were 
hypertension, asthma, non-infective bronchitis, and abdominal pain. PTs in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group 
was gastroenteritis. PTs in the placebo for dupilumab 300 mg q2w were asthma, concussion, and road 
accident. No adolescent patients died during the study. 
The overall treatment discontinuation rate due to TEAEs was low in all treatment groups (1 [2.9%]: 
neutropenia and 2 [5.9%]: Epstein Barr virus infection and neutrophil count decreased, patients in the 
dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively versus 0 and 1 [5.6%]: herpes zoster patient 
in the matching placebo groups). Injection site reactions were the most frequently reported AESIs (3 patients 
[8.8%] and 4 patients [11.8%] in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and dupilumab 300 mg q2w groups, 
respectively versus 0 and 1 patient [5.6%] in the matching placebo groups). 
Overall, the AE profile of dupilumab in adolescent patients with asthma was similar to the AE profile seen in 
adults. There were 3 adolescents randomized in EFC13691. Of these, 2 were assigned to placebo. The 
single adolescent who received dupilumab did not experience any AEs. 
Table 5: Overview of AE profile: TEAE – Adolescents in the  safety population  
Study R668-AD-1412 (supportive safety data) 
Study Design 
Study R668-AD-1412 was a Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, ascending dose, sequential cohort study 
investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and efficacy of single dose and repeat doses of 
subcutaneous dupilumab in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD (for adolescents ≥12 to <18 years 
of age) or severe AD (for children ≥6 to <12 years of age) that was not adequately controlled by topical 
treatments. The primary objective of this first pediatric study of dupilumab was to obtain safety and PK data 
in pediatric patients with AD. Patients received a single dose of dupilumab in Part A followed by 8 weeks of no 
treatment and then 4 weekly doses of dupilumab in Part B. 
Disposition 
A total of 40 adolescent patients (aged ≥12 to <18 years), were enrolled into the study and randomized to 
the 2 treatment groups (20 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 patients in the 4 mg/kg group). Among 
adolescent patients, most (38/40 [95.0%] patients) completed treatment in both Part A and Part B. Two 
(5.0%) patients aged ≥12 to <18 years old were withdrawn from treatment. 
Exposure and Overall Safety Findings 
In adolescents, with the exception of two patients (1 in the 2 mg/kg subgroup, and 1 in the 4 mg/kg 
subgroup) all patients received all 5 scheduled doses of study drug. As shown in Table 11, the number of 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 122/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE during the entire study was higher in the 4 mg/kg dose cohort than in 
the 2 mg/kg cohort in adolescents (16 [80.0%] versus 11 [55.0%]). 
Table 6: Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events during Study R668-AD-1412 - 
adolescent >=12 to <18 years of age (safety analysis set) 
Overall, dupilumab administered as single and repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for 4 weeks 
was generally well tolerated in both pediatric age groups included in this study. There was a higher incidence 
of TEAEs after administration of a single dose of 4 mg/kg in both age groups. Similarly, there was a higher 
incidence of TEAEs after administration of repeated weekly doses of 4 mg/kg in both age-groups. However, 
most of the AEs were mild in intensity, transient in nature and not related to study drug. There were no new 
safety signals detected with dupilumab in this pediatric population. The most common AEs reported after 
both single doses and repeated weekly doses were Nasopharyngitis and exacerbation of AD. Nasopharyngitis 
has been reported previously as one of the most common AEs in adult trials with dupilumab. The episodes of 
exacerbation of AD could have resulted from the study design in which patients had an 8 week gap in 
treatment between single dose administration during Part A and start of Part B. There were very few AEs of 
conjunctivitis reported in both age groups in this study. 
Severe and serious adverse events and deaths 
1) Severe TEAE 
Safety pool (studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
Most of the TEAEs in all treatment groups were mild to moderate in intensity. A higher proportion of patients 
in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (9.4% [74/788]) experienced severe TEAEs compared with patients in 
the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and placebo groups (6.8% [53/779] and 6.9% [55/792], respectively); incidence 
in the dupilumab combined group was 8.1%).  
Overall, the most frequently reported severe TEAE was Asthma with 25 patients reporting the event: 10 
patients (1.3%) in both the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group and the placebo group, and 5 patients (0.6%) in 
the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group. 
The most frequently reported severe TEAEs in dupilumab-treated patients were mainly injection site reactions 
and they occurred in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w treatment group (injection site erythema (10 patients 
[1.3%]), injection site pruritus (6 patients [0.8%]), injection site pain (6 patients [0.8%]), injection site 
oedema (5 patients [0.6%]), and injection site inflammation (4 patients [0.5%]). 
Severe TEAE PTs in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group reported in 2 patients were eosinophilia and 
pregnancy. No PTs were reported in more than 2 patients with the exception of worsening of Asthma (10 
patients), as provided above. Severe TEAE PTs in the placebo group reported in 2 patients or more were 
Asthma (10 patients) headache (4 patients), road traffic accident (3 patients), syncope (2 patients), breast 
cancer (2 patients), and pneumonia (2 patients). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 123/161 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
Study EFC13691 
Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were reported for 9.7% in the dupilumab group 
versus 4.7% in the placebo group. TEAEs of severe intensity reported in at least 2 patients in any treatment 
group included worsening of Asthma (2.9% in the dupilumab group versus 1.9% in the placebo group) and 
cough (1.9% in the dupilumab group versus 0% in the placebo group). 
Study LTS12551 
Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies. 
Most patients had TEAEs that were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were reported for 77 (4.2%) 
patients overall. The only severe TEAE that occurred with an incidence of ≥0.5% of patients overall was 
Asthma (0.5%)  
Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study Most patients had TEAEs that were mild or moderate in intensity. 
Severe TEAEs were reported for 5 (3.6%) patients. 
2) Deaths 
Overall, in the dupilumab asthma studies, a total of 15 deaths were reported of which 13 deaths occurred 
during the treatment period, one of these cases had the AE onset during the treatment emergent period and 
died approximately 77 days after the last dose of IMP. One death occurred during the post-treatment period, 
and 1 death occurred during the screening period (prior to receiving IMP). The deaths are presented below. 
Pooled Safety Population  
The proportion of deaths was balanced between the combined dupilumab group (0.3% [n=5]) and the 
placebo group (0.4% [n=3]). 
In the pooled safety population treatment groups, 8 patients experienced one or more TEAEs leading to 
death: 1 (0.1%) patient in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, 4 (0.5%) patients in the dupilumab 300 mg 
q2w group, and 3 (0.4%) patients in the placebo group. One of these cases had the AE onset during the 
treatment emergent period and died approximately 77 days after the last dose of IMP.  
Dupilumab 200 mg q2w treatment group 
• A 76-year-old female patient experienced pulmonary embolism on Day 311 that resulted in death on Day 
354. Investigator's assessment of causality for the pulmonary embolism was not related to the IMP.  
Dupilumab 300 mg q2w treatment group  
• A 61-year-old female experienced a fatal cardio-respiratory arrest on Day 124. No acute asthma 
exacerbation was noted in the days preceding death. No autopsy was performed. The Investigator's 
assessment of causality for the cardio-respiratory arrest was not related to the IMP. 
• A 70-year-old male experienced respiratory depression and cardio-respiratory arrest on Day 125, which 
required hospitalization and resulted in death on Day 145. The cardio-respiratory arrest was considered as a 
consequence of a severe hypoxic condition secondary to the respiratory depression. No autopsy was 
performed. The Investigator's assessment of causality of this event was not related to the IMP. 
• A 59-year-old male patient from the US with a BMI of 41.81 kg/m2 experienced cardiac failure congestive 
on Day 88, ventricular tachycardia on Day 159, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on Day 162, which 
required hospitalization and resulted in death on Day 165. The Investigator's assessment of causality for 
these events was not related to the IMP. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 124/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
• A 64-year-old female experienced hemorrhagic necrotic pancreatitis and abdominal sepsis approximately 6 
months after IMP discontinuation that resulted in death on Day 350 (7 months after the last IMP 
administration). The Investigator's assessment of causality for these events was not related to the IMP. 
Study DRI12544 
2 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q4w treatment group experienced TEAEs leading to death. Please note 
that these 2 deaths are not included in the pooled safety population because the patients were in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q4w treatment group. 
• A 43-year-old male patient died due to an SAE of severe acute cardiovascular failure. The event of cardiac 
failure acute was considered as not related to the IMP by the Investigator.  
• A 45-year-old male patient died on 10 October 2014 due to severe metastatic gastric cancer, severe 
bilateral subtotal organizing pneumonia, and severe acute cor pulmonale. These events were considered as 
not related to the IMP by the Investigator. 
Study LTS12551 
In Study LTS12551 – 3 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, all of them rolled over from DRI12544 
and previously treated with dupilumab in the parent study, experienced TEAEs leading to death. 
• Lung cancer metastatic - this 64-year-old male former smoker patient the patient was diagnosed with lung 
cancer with brain metastases leading to death less than 3 months later. Final clinical diagnosis was peripheral 
right upper lobe lung cancer without histological confirmation.  
• Adenocarcinoma gastric - this non-smoker 62-year-old male patient, previously in Study DRI12544 
(dupilumab 200 mg q2w), with a past medical history of chronic gastritis, was diagnosed with 
adenocarcinoma of the stomach with liver metastases 1 year and 5 months after the first dose of dupilumab, 
and leading to death 4 months later.  
• Craniocerebral injury - this 72-year-old male patient, previously in Study DRI12544 (dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w) was struck by motor vehicle and suffered fatal craniocerebral injury after he had completed study 
participation. 
The cases of lung cancer metastatic and adenocarcinoma gastric were assessed by the Investigator as 
related to the IMP.  
•Screening period: A patient, who was randomized to Study EFC13579 but did not receive IMP, died suddenly 
during the screening period. The causes of death were Ventricular fibrillation, Hypoxemic respiratory failure 
with no pulse, and Hypokalemia (not related to IMP). 
• Additionally, 1 patient in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group had an adverse event leading to death (suicide) 
that occurred in the post treatment period (not related to IMP).  
3) Other serious adverse events 
Safety pool (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs was comparable across the treatment groups 
(7.6% and 8.6% of patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and dupilumab 300 mg q2w groups and 7.8% in 
the placebo group). 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 125/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAE was worsening of asthma with similar incidences in 
the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and placebo groups (2.1% [16 patients] and 2.3% [18 patients], respectively) 
and a lower incidence in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group (0.9% [7 patients]). 
After the SAE of Asthma, the next most frequently reported events were Pneumonia (5 patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group and 2 patients in the placebo group), Gastroenteritis (3 patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group and 1 patient in the placebo group), and Pregnancy (3 patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w group). Apart from asthma, the most commonly reported SAEs in the placebo group 
were Road traffic accident and Osteoarthritis (3 patients for each PT). 
Incidence of treatment-related SAEs, as determined by the Investigator, was low in all treatment groups: 
0.1% (1 patient, dupilumab 200 mg q2w), 0.8% (6 patients, dupilumab 300 mg q2w), 0.4% (7 patients, 
dupilumab combined), and 0.1% (1 patient, placebo). In the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group the treatment-
related SAE PTs were eosinophilia (n=2), Eosinophilic pneumonia chronic (n=1), Anaphylactic reaction (n=1), 
Eczema (n=1), Injection site erythema (n=1), Injection site inflammation (n=1), and Injection site oedema 
(n=1). 
Table 7: Number (%) of patients with treatment-emergent SAE(s), >=0.5% in Primary SOC in any 
treatment group - pooled safety population 
An apparent treatment group difference was noted for the cardiac disorders primary SOC, with 10 (1.3%) 
patients in the 300 mg q2w dupilumab group, 4 (0.5%) patients in the 200 mg q2w dupilumab group, and 0 
patients in the placebo group experiencing a serious event. An apparent treatment difference for SAEs 
identified by the cardiac was only observed in the EFC13579 study and prompted a database search followed 
by an external adjudication of potential cardiovascular events. 
24 Week period in the safety pool 
The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs during the entire TEAE period was more than or 
almost double of what was observed during the 24-week treatment period in the treatment groups (7.6% 
versus 3.6% in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, 8.6% versus 4.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, 
and 7.8% versus 4.4% in the placebo group) due to longer exposure period. But the incidence and type of 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 126/161 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
SAEs observed during the 24-week treatment period were consistent with those observed during the entire 
TEAE period. No additional safety signals were identified during the first 24 week treatment-emergent period. 
Study EFC13691 
Overall, 9 (8.7%) patients in the dupilumab group versus 6 (5.6%) patients in the placebo group reported at 
least 1 treatment-emergent SAE. With few exceptions, treatment-emergent SAEs by PT were reported by 
single patients only, with no pattern of distribution or imbalance among treatment groups. The most frequent 
SAE was asthma, reported in 6 patients (3 patients each in the dupilumab and placebo groups); each of 
these events was a severe asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization. Two patients in the dupilumab 
group had eosinophilia compared to none in the placebo group. All other SAEs were reported in 1 patient and 
no apparent differences were observed between groups. No SAEs in the cardiac disorders SOC were reported 
during the study. 
Study LTS12551 
Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies. Overall, 94 (5.1%) patients reported at least 1 
treatment-emergent SAE. In general, individual PTs were reported at a low frequency with no marked trend. 
The most frequently reported treatment emergent SAEs (PT) that occurred in ≥0.5% of patients in the 
overall group were asthma and pneumonia (0.6% of patients for each PT). Asthma events consisted of severe 
asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, except one event that did 
not require hospitalization but was considered by the Investigator as medically important 
In patients enrolled from Study DRI12544, 14 (12.6%) patients in the placebo/dupilumab group and 42 
(10.0%) patients in the dupilumab/dupilumab group experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. A trend 
towards a higher incidence of asthma in patients previously treated with placebo as compared to those 
previously treated with dupilumab was observed in patients enrolled from Study DRI12544 (3.6% versus 
0.5%). 
In patients enrolled from Study EFC13579, 9 (2.1%) patients in the placebo/dupilumab group and 29 (3.3%) 
patients in the dupilumab/dupilumab group experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. No apparent 
differences were observed between groups. The incidence of serious cardiac events was low. Three patients 
had SAEs of atrial fibrillation. Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study Overall, 8 (5.8%) patients reported 
at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE; the incidence was similar between the placebo/dupilumab and 
dupilumab/dupilumab groups (6.0% and 5.7%, respectively). Treatment emergent SAEs by PT were reported 
by single patients only. No SAEs in the cardiac disorders SOC were reported during the study. 
4) Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Safety pool (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
An overview of the number (%) of patients who experienced AESIs or other selected AE grouping events (by 
category) in the safety pool is provided in Table 13. The injection site reaction group had the highest 
incidence of treatment-emergent AE in all treatment groups, with higher incidences in the dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w and 300 mg q2w groups (16.0% [125/779] and 20.1% [158/788], respectively) compared with placebo 
(9.0% [71/792]). Further information on each AESI category and other AE grouping categories along with all 
PTs in those categories is provided in the sub-sections below, starting with Anaphylactic Reactions.

Table 8: Number (%) of patients with treatment-emergent AESIs and other selected AE grouping 
events by category – pooled safety population 
24 Week period in the safety pool 
Incidences for all AESI and events in other AE grouping categories were lower in the 24-week treatment 
period compared with the whole treatment period. 
For the AESI category of “injection site reactions (serious/severe)” and for the other AE group of “injection 
site reactions”, incidences were the same or similar in the 24-week treatment period and the whole TEAE 
period (ie, 52 weeks). This indicates that most injection site reactions occurred during the first 24 weeks of 
treatment. The data below are respective to dupilumab 200 mg q2w, dupilumab 300 mg q2w, and placebo 
groups. 
• Injection site reactions (serious/severe) 
- 24-week (0.3% [2/779], 1.4% [11/788], and 0% [0/792]) 
- 52-week (0.3% [2/779], 1.4% [11/788], and 0% [0/792]) 
• Injection site reactions (other AE group) 
- 24-week (15.1% [118/779], 19.3% [152/788], and 7.6% [60/792]) 
- 52-week (16.0% [125/779], 20.1% [158/788], and 9.0% [71/792]) 
Study EFC13691 
An overview summary of the number (%) of patients with treatment-emergent AESIs or other selected AE 
grouping events by category and PT is provided in Table 14. Overall, the number (%) of patients with any 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 128/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
treatment-emergent AESIs was low and comparable between the dupilumab group (5 [4.9%]) and the 
placebo group (6 [5.6%]). More patients in dupilumab group (n=21 [20.4%]) experienced any treatment-
emergent selected AE grouping events compared to placebo (n=8 [7.5%]); difference predominantly driven 
by “Eosinophilia TEAEs”, which occurred at a higher frequency in the dupilumab group compared with the 
placebo group: 14 (13.6%) patients in the dupilumab group versus 1 (0.9%) in the placebo group. These 
events and others are further detailed by category in the sub-sections below. 
Table 9: Number (%) of patients with treatment emergent AESIs and other selected AE grouping 
events by category in Study EFC13691- Safety population 
Study LTS12551 (Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies) 
An overview summary of the number (%) of patients with treatment-emergent AESIs or other selected AE 
grouping events by category and PT is provided in Table 15. As shown, more patients who were on placebo in 
the parent study reported other selected AE grouping events by category compared to patients who were on 
dupilumab in the parent study with difference not surprisingly driven predominantly by injection site 
reactions.  
Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study  
An overview summary of the number (%) of patients with treatment-emergent AESIs or other selected AE 
grouping events by category and PT is provided in Table 15. As shown, few patients reported AESIs or other

selected AE grouping events, with most events being reported by patients who were on placebo in the parent 
study. 
Analyses of different AESI 
Safety pool (studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
Anaphylactic reaction 
In the safety pool, there was a single anaphylactic reaction related to IMP, for which the causal relationship 
to dupilumab could not be ruled out. In total, there were 3 reports of anaphylactic reactions and 1 report of 
anaphylactic shock, all were SAEs. 
Systemic hypersensitivity 
Systemic hypersensitivity (medically reviewed) was reported for 23 (3.0%) patients in the dupilumab 200 mg 
q2w group, 34 (4.3%) patients in the 300 mg q2w, and 20 (2.5%) in the placebo group (Table 32). The most 
frequently reported events were Urticaria with similar incidences in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and placebo 
groups (0.5% [4/779] and 0.6% [5/792],respectively), and a higher incidence in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
group (1.3% [10/788]); and Rash with similar incidences in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w 
groups (0.6% [5/779] and 0.5% [4/788], respectively) and a lower incidence in placebo (0.1% [1/792]).  
Most cases of hypersensitivity were mild or moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of the 
IMP. 3 patients each, in the dupilumab dose groups, experienced TEAE of Erythema nodosum and 
Angioedema. None of these TEAE of Erythema nodosum and Angioedema were serious, did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation, resolved completely and were not related to dupilumab.

Anaphylactic reaction No cases. 
Systemic hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity (rash) was reported for 2 patients (1.9%) in the dupilumab group and 1 patient (1.0%) in 
the placebo group (Patient No. 013691-804-001-303). None of these events were considered SAEs. All cases 
of hypersensitivity were mild or moderate in severity, and all patients with hypersensitivity recovered. All 3 
patients were ADA negative at all time points. 
Study LTS12551 (Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies) 
Anaphylactic reaction 
Events identified by anaphylactic reaction SMQ algorithmic approach were reported by 3 patients overall, 1 
patient was previously treated with dupilumab in Study DRI12544 and 2 were previously treated with placebo 
in Study EFC13579. None of the cases of anaphylactic reaction was considered to be related to dupilumab. 
Two cases of anaphylactic reaction were related to known triggers other than dupilumab and had negative re-
challenges with IMP; the third one occurred 90 days after last IMP administration. None of the cases led to 
permanent discontinuation of dupilumab. All 3 patients recovered from these events. 
Systemic hypersensitivity 
The number of patients with hypersensitivity TEAEs was similar in the placebo/dupilumab and 
dupilumab/dupilumab groups for patients enrolled from Study DRI12544 (4.5% and 5.2%, respectively) and 
EMA/188111/2019

was also similar in the placebo/dupilumab and dupilumab/dupilumab groups for patients enrolled from Study 
EFC13579 (0.7% and 1.0%, respectively. Most cases of hypersensitivity were mild or moderate in intensity, 
with only 3 cases reported as severe. Most patients with hypersensitivity recovered or were recovering, with 
only 2 cases reported as not recovered at the data cut-off date. 
Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study 
Anaphylactic reaction 
No cases. 
Systemic hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity was reported by 1 (0.7%) patient that led to permanent treatment discontinuation; the 
patient recovered. The patient had high IgE levels (302 IU/mL at baseline of the parent study and 197 IU/mL 
at Visit 17). The AE was considered by the Investigator as related to the IMP. The patient was negative for 
ADA. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (high level term) 
Dupilumab is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection and like all biologics administered SC would be 
expected to cause injection site reactions (ISRs) in some patients. Data on the incidence of ISRs were 
collected as part of the safety program and serious or severe ISRs lasting longer than 24 hours were handled 
as adverse events of special interest (AESI) in the dupilumab program. 
Safety pool (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
Injection site reactions, identified by HLT, were reported for more patients in the combined dupilumab group 
(283 patients [18.1%]) than the placebo group (71 patients [9.0%]). ISRs were reported more frequently in 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w treated patients than 200 mg q2w treated patients (158 patients [20.1%]) and 125 
patients [16.0%]. Among patients who experienced ISRs, most of the ISRs were mild (85.9%, 80.8%, and 
74.7%) or moderate (12.7%, 17.6%, and 18.4%) in the placebo, dupilumab 200 mg q2w, and dupilumab 
300 mg q2w group respectively and resolved spontaneously. Severe or serious ISRs were infrequent. 
Injection site reactions leading to discontinuation was uncommon. None of placebo patients, 5 (0.6%) 
patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group, and 13 (1.6%) patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w 
discontinued the IMP due to an ISR. The proportion of patients experiencing ISRs (ie, HLT of injection site 
reactions) was highest at Week 0 (after loading dose injection) and then diminished over time. There was no 
discernible difference in the proportion between the two dose groups by Week 8 (5.5% versus 5.0%, 
respectively). 
Study EFC13691 
Injection site reactions were reported for 9 patients (8.7%) in the dupilumab group and 4 patients (3.7%) in 
the placebo group. The majority of patients (77.8% [7/9]) in the dupilumab group who experienced a local 
injection site reaction had a single episode while 2 patients (22.2% [2/9]) had 2 episodes; 1 (25.0% [1/4]) 
patient in the placebo group had at least 4 episodes. Injection site reactions occurred at every injection week 
and there was no apparent distribution pattern. 
Study LTS12551 (Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies) 
Overall,  injection  site  reactions  were  reported  by  165  (8.9%)  patients.  In  patients  enrolled  from  Study 
DRI12544,  patients  previously  treated  with  placebo  and  newly  treated  with  dupilumab  in  this  study  had  a 
higher  incidence  of  injection  site  reaction  TEAEs  than  patients  previously  treated  with  dupilumab  (29.7% 
versus  15.7%).  In  patients  enrolled  from  Study  EFC13579,  patients  previously  treated  with  placebo  and 
newly  treated  with  dupilumab  in  this  study  had  a  higher  incidence  of  injection  site  reaction  TEAEs  than 
patients previously treated with dupilumab (6.6% versus 4.2%). Most injection site reactions occurred before 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 132/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
24 weeks of treatment. No case of injection site reaction was considered as serious. Injection site reaction led 
to permanent discontinuation of dupilumab in only 2 patients. 
5) OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST: 
Eosinophilia 
Across all dupilumab studies for the treatment of asthma as well as most studies in atopic dermatitis, 
dupilumab-treated subjects had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophils compared 
to subjects treated with placebo. Eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels by the end of the studies. 
This transient rise in blood eosinophils seen across these studies is consistent with the current understanding 
of the mechanism of action of dupilumab. In the atopic dermatitis clinical development program, 
approximately 1% of patients treated with dupilumab developed a transient blood eosinophilia of greater than 
5 Giga/L. In the clinical development program for atopic dermatitis there were no serious adverse events 
associated with this level of elevated blood eosinophils.  
In the asthma pooled safety population a greater proportion of patients in the combined dupilumab treatment 
group experienced transient blood eosinophilia to greater than 5 Giga/L (1.1%) compared with placebo-
treated patients (0.4%). In the oral steroid withdrawal study, EFC13691, in which patients on dupilumab had 
greater oral corticosteroid reductions than patients on placebo, 2.9% of dupilumab and 0.9% for placebo had 
blood eosinophilia counts >5 Giga/L; whilst 0.15% of dupilumab treated patients in long-term safety study 
LTS12551 had this level of eosinophil increase at any time during the course of the study. 
This increase in blood eosinophils was typically transient and generally not associated with clinically relevant 
adverse events and, in fact, was associated with greater efficacy on FEV1 and exacerbations when compared 
with the treatment group as a whole. Unlike the clinical program for AD, in the asthma program, there were 
rare cases of patients treated with dupilumab who experienced blood eosinophilia associated with clinical 
symptoms such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitiis (2 patients with EGPA, otherwise known as 
Churg Strauss) and 2 with eosinophilic pneumonia. 
In the Phase 3 studies (EFC13579, EFC13691 and LTS12551) patients with baseline eosinophil counts >1.5 
Giga/L were excluded. The effects of further increases in blood eosinophils in these patients with moderate to 
severe asthma were uncertain at the time these studies were initiated. In addition, investigators were 
instructed to report elevations of eosinophil counts ≥3.0 Giga/L as a TEAE, in order to enhance identification 
of these cases for close observation during study conduct. 
In the pooled safety population, a total of 57 patients experienced “Eosinophilia TEAEs”, which occurred at a 
higher frequency in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group: 
53 (3.4%) dupilumab combined group dupilumab group versus 4 (0.5% in the placebo group. In the oral 
steroid withdrawal study (EFC13691), a total of 15 patients experienced “Eosinophilia TEAEs”, which occurred 
at a higher frequency in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group: 14 (13.6%) patients in the 
dupilumab group versus 1 (0.9%) in the placebo group. The higher frequency of increase in eosinophils 
reported in this study, compared to other dupilumab asthma studies, is likely due to the fact that steroid 
tapering is a known trigger for eosinophilia and patients on dupilumab had a more extensive taper than those 
on placebo. In the study LTS12551 “Eosinophilia TEAEs” were reported by 28 (1.4%) patients overall.

Safety in special populations 
The effect of patient baseline characteristics on the incidence of patients with any TEAE, any TEAE by primary 
SOC, any treatment emergent SAE, any TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation, and any AESI/other 
selected AE grouping by category were assessed according to pre-defined intrinsic factors (age, sex, race, 
weight, BMI, baseline blood eosinophil level, baseline ACQ-5, and number of prior severe asthma 
exacerbations). The incidence of patients for each treatment group and the relative risk (95% CI) for each 
dupilumab dose versus placebo was summarized for each subgroup category of intrinsic factor (eg, age 
categories of <18 years, 18 to 64 years, and ≥65 years). 
Dupilumab treatment was not associated with an increase in the proportion of patients with TEAEs for each 
subgroup category as the 95% CIs of the relative risk ratios for each dupilumab treatment group (200 q2w 
and 300 mg q2w) versus placebo included the value of 1.0.  
In summary, there was no suggestion of increased risk for TEAEs with dupilumab treatment compared with 
placebo in any of the intrinsic factor subgroups examined (ie, age, sex, race, weight, BMI, baseline blood 
eosinophil level, baseline ACQ-5 scores, and the number of prior severe asthma exacerbations at baseline).

EXTRINSIC FACTORS 
The incidence of any TEAE, any TEAE by primary SOC, any treatment emergent SAE, any TEAE leading to 
treatment discontinuation, and any AESI/other selected AE grouping by category was assessed according to 
the following extrinsic factors using the same methodology as described for intrinsic factors: 
• Region (Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Western Countries) 
• Territory (North America, European Union, Rest of World) 
• Territory (Japan, non-Japan)

For subgroups of region and territories, dupilumab treatment was not associated with an increase in the 
proportion of patients with TEAEs as the 95% CIs of the relative risk ratios for each dupilumab treatment 
group (200 q2w and 300 mg q2w) versus placebo included the value of 1.0. 
USE IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION 
A total of 23 pregnancies were reported in asthma studies DRI12544, EFC13579, and LTS12551. No 
pregnancies were reported in studies EFC13691 and ACT11457. Of the 23 pregnancies, 4 pregnancies 
occurred in placebo patients in Study EFC13579. Of these 4, 2 pregnancies resulted in live births of normal 
infants, 1 pregnancy ended in ectopic pregnancy and 1 pregnancy is ongoing at the time of this report. 
Among the 19 pregnancies in dupilumab treated patients, 6 occurred in Study DRI12544, 10 occurred in 
Study EFC13579 and 3 occurred in Study LTS12551. Spontaneous abortions (SABs) occurred in 3 of 6 
dupilumab treated patients in Study DRI12544 and 2 of 3 in long-term, open-label Study LTS12551. There 
were no SABs 
reported in Study EFC13579. To date, one women in study EFC13579 delivered a baby with 
congenital anomaly of Turner’s syndrome associated with bicuspid aortic valve (Table 22). 
Table 14: Summary of pregnancy outcomes in asthma studies DRI12544, EFC13579, and 
LTS12551 
Review of past medical history and obstetrical history in those patients who experienced SAB revealed 
etiologies for this event that were not related to dupilumab in 3 of 5 patients. Alternate explanations for 
these 3 SABs included genetic mutations associated with hypercoagulable state, which are known risk factors 
for pregnancy loss, prior use of infertility treatments, advanced maternal age, and twin pregnancy.

Immunological events 
Incidence and characterization of Anti-dupilumab Antibodies 
Anti dupilumab antibody status was determined at baseline (Day 1) and at pre-specified time points. ADA 
population consisted of all patients in the safety population who received any study drug and who had at 
least one non-missing reportable ADA result post first dose. An inverse relationship between ADA incidence 
and cumulative monthly dose was observed, where lower ADA incidence was associated with a higher dose. 
Majority of ADA responses in the dupilumab dosed groups were low titer. The frequency of high titer ADA 
responses, treatment boosted responses, persistent ADA responses were generally similar in the dupilumab 
dosed groups compared to the placebo group. The pooled ADA analysis with Studies DRI12544, EFC13579 
and EFC13691 was consistent with ADA results observed in the safety pool. 
Analyses for neutralizing antibodies were performed for Phase 3 studies only. In Study EFC13579 
approximately 2% of all subjects at 300 mg q2w and 4.3% of all subjects at 200 mg q2w were classified as 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive, compared to 1.6% in the placebo group. Among the NAb positive 
patients, only 8 patients had high ADA titers (>10 000), of which 5 were in the 200 mg q2w dose group and 
3 were in the 300 mg q2w dose group. In Study EFC13691 the treatment emergent positive ADA response in 
the OCS-sparing study (Study EFC13691) was similar to Study EFC13579 in the 300 mg q2w group (5.0%) 
and placebo group (4.7%), with majority being low titer responses. NAb incidence was also low with 3.0% of 
patients with dupilumab treatment positive for NAb. 
ASSOCIATION OF ADA TO ADVERSE EVENTS 
For the discussion of ADAs and adverse events, patients with treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted 
ADA responses were defined as ADA-positive, and patients who were ADA negative at all times or had pre-
existing immunoreactivity were defined as ADA-negative (neither treatmentemergent nor treatment-
boosted). Analyses of TEAEs by MedDRA primary SOC and PT were performed for subgroups of patients 
based on ADA response status. More focused analyses evaluated association of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, 
and serious or severe (lasting more than 24 hours) injection site reactions by ADA response status. In 
addition, the occurrence of these TEAEs was evaluated in patients with a high titer (>10 000) response. 
The limited numbers of patients with Nab responses in Studies EFC13579 and EFC13691 do not allow for any 
statistical approach to assess the impact of NAb on TEAEs. However, manual review of cases did not identify 
any meaningful associations. 
Overview of TEAEs in the Safety pool (studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
Overall, comparison of the frequencies of TEAEs by primary SOC and ADA status did not show meaningful 
differences between the ADA positive and ADA negative group, except for a numerical difference between the 
incidence of ISRs. The incidences of experiencing at least 1 TEAE were similar between treatment groups and 
ADA response status. Of all the TEAEs listed in the table, only injection site erythema and injection site 
pruritis showed a numerical difference greater than ≥10 % between ADA positive and ADA negative group. 
However, the number of patients with treatment emergent ADA who experienced at least 1 TEAE in all 
treatment groups was small and is even smaller at the individual TEAE level. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, incidence of severe TEAEs was higher in ADA positive patients than in 
ADA negative patients: 16.4% (10/61) versus 8.6% (62/720) this was driven primarily by severe injection 
site reactions. Severe TEAEs were similar in proportion in the ADA positive 7.3% (7/96)) versus the ADA 
negative 6.6% (45/677) population in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group. Overall these TEAE rates were 
similar to those observed in the placebo group. Incidence of SAEs in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group was 
numerically higher in ADA positive patients than in ADA negative patients (14.8% (9/61) versus 7.9% 
(57/720]), and was not driven by any particular PT. However, the number of patients who experienced an 
SAE and exhibited ADA positive response was very small and therefore no clear association can be 
established . A higher percentage of ADA positive patients 13.1% (8/61) discontinued treatment compared to 
ADA negative patients 5.1% (37/720) in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group. In the ADA positive group 4 out 
of 8 patients discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions. Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 139/161 
 
 
  
  
  
leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment was low and similar between ADA positive and ADA 
negative patients in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group (5.2% [5/96] and 3.0% [20/677]). 
Study EFC13691 
Analysis of the potential association between treatment-emergent ADA response and the incidence of TEAEs 
was limited by the small number of ADA-positive patients (N=5) in the dupilumab group in this study. Only 3 
of these 5 patients exhibited high titers (>10 000). Of these 5 ADA positive patients, only 3 had TEAEs of 
which none were hypersensitivity reactions and none of these led to treatment discontinuation. Two patients 
with an AESI of hypersensitivity and 13 other patients who experienced ISRs were all ADA negative. The 
review of the results of the subgroup analyses based on ADA response status and AEs showed that presence 
of ADA response did not appear to be associated with any safety findings in this study. 
Study LTS12551 
Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies: 
Overall, 69 of the 90 (76.7%) treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients and 832 of the 1195 (69.5%) ADA-
negative patients had at least 1 TEAE during the study. The most frequently affected SOCs in the ADA-
positive population were similar to that observed in the overall safety population and no differences in the 
type of TEAEs was noted between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients. 
No particular pattern of TEAEs was found among the 5 patients with high (>10 000) ADA titer. Four of the 5 
patients experienced TEAEs; none of which were serious or led to permanent treatment discontinuation. Four 
of the 90 (4.4%) patients with treatment-emergent ADA responses versus 32 of 1195 (2.7%) ADA-negative 
patients experienced hypersensitivity. No association was observed between persistent ADA response and 
hypersensitivity reactions. Three other patients experienced anaphylactic reactions. One of these patients 
was ADA negative at time of the AE onset, however, later developed a low titer transient ADA response. The 
other 2 patients were ADA negative. None of the patients who exhibited persistent ADA response or high 
titers (>10 000) experienced any anaphylactic reaction. 
Overall, 10 of 90 (11.1%) of the treatment-emergent ADA positive patients and 136 of 1195 (11.4%) of the 
ADA negative patients had injection site reactions. Of the 10 ADA-positive patients who had injection site 
reactions, 6 exhibited persistent ADA response, however, none of these events were considered serious or 
resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study: 
There were a total of 4 treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients. Three of these 4 treatment-emergent 
ADA-positive patients and 37 of the 69 ADA-negative patients had at least 1 TEAE during the study. None of 
the 4 treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients experienced hypersensitivity or injection site reactions. 
Neutralizing antibody responses do not appear to have any association with hypersensitivity or injection site 
reactions, as the only patient who was NAb positive did not experience hypersensitivity reaction or injection 
site reactions. This patient experienced some TEAEs and also exhibited high (>10 000) ADA titer. However, 
all of these TEAEs were non-serious and did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
Overall, the incidence of treatment emergent ADA was generally low in all dupilumab treated groups. High 
titer responses were uncommon (<1%) in the safety pool. Of the patients with treatment emergent high ADA 
titer, none reported serious TEAEs. Comparison of TEAEs in patients by ADA status in safety pool showed that 
the clinically relevant events observed at a higher frequency in ADA positive versus ADA negative subgroup, 
were injection site reactions (injection site erythema and injection site pruritus). Only in the dupilumab 
300 mg q2w treated group, some ADA positive patients discontinued treatment due to ISRs, compared to 
ADA negative patients. Overall, hypersensitivity reactions did not show a clear temporal association with 
presence of ADA responses. There was one anaphylactic reaction considered to be drug related and this case 
was not associated with a treatment emergent ADA response.

No data available. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
Safety pool (Studies DRI12544 and EFC13579) 
The proportion of patients who had at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation was low 
(3.2% and 6.1% in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, and 4.3% in the 
placebo group).  
Based on 100 patient-year data, the number of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to one 
or more TEAEs was: 3.5 (dupilumab 200 mg q2w), 6.8 (dupilumab 300 mg q2w) and 4.7 (placebo). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs that led to study discontinuation in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w treatment groups were injection site erythema (0.5% [4 patients] and 1.5% [12 
patients]), injection site oedema (0.1% [1 patient] and 0.9% [7 patients]), injection site pruritus (0.3% [2 
patients] and 0.9% [7 patients]), injection site inflammation (0.0% and 0.6% [5 patients]), and injection site 
pain (0.1% [1 patient] and 0.6% [5 patients]); no placebo-treated patients reported discontinuations due to 
these PTs. In the placebo treatment group, the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation in 
2 patients or more and with a frequency greater than in the dupilumab groups were herpes zoster (0.4% [3 
patients] versus 0.0% in the both dupilumab groups), breast cancer (0.3% [2 patients] versus 0.0% in the 
both dupilumab groups), and rash pruritic (0.3% [2 patients] versus 0.1% [1 patient] in the dupilumab 200 
mg q2w group]).  
The majority of patients in the dupilumab treatment groups who permanently discontinued treatment due to 
a TEAE did so within the first 13 weeks of treatment: 60% (15 of 25 patients) for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w 
group and 54.2% (26 of 48 patients) in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w group, compared with 35.3% (12 of 34 
patients) in the placebo group. 
24 Week period in the safety pool 
As described above (discontinuation rates by exposure interval in the pooled safety population), the majority 
of the dupilumab-treated patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to a TEAE did so within the 
first 13 weeks of the study. The most frequently reported TEAEs that led to study discontinuation in the 
dupilumab treatment groups were the same TEAEs and with the identical frequency as in the 52 week data. 
Study EFC13691 
The overall discontinuation rate due to TEAEs was low: 1 (1.0%) patient in the dupilumab group versus 4 
(3.7%) patients in the placebo group. All TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation at PT level 
were reported by 1 patient each: arthralgia in the dupilumab group; gastrointestinal stromal tumour, 
eosinophilia, adrenal insufficiency, and asthmatic crisis in the placebo group. 
Study LTS12551 
Patients rolled over from DRI12544 and EFC13579 studies:  
The overall rate of treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was low (2.1%). Most of TEAEs leading to 
permanent treatment discontinuation at PT level were reported by 1 patient each. The following TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation were reported by 2 patients each: eosinophilia, neutropenia, urticaria, 
injection site erythema, and injection site pain.  
Patients rolled over from EFC13691 study: 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 141/161 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
The overall rate of treatment discontinuation due to AE was low (2.2%). Three patients previously treated 
with dupilumab, versus none receiving placebo in the parent study, experienced AEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation. The PTs were eosinophilia, hypersensitivity, and tendinitis. 
WITHDRAWAL AND REBOUND 
Post-treatment AE incidence was low in all treatment groups: 2.7% (dupilumab 200 mg q2w) 3.6% 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w), and 2.1% (placebo). No PT had an incidence ≥1%. The most frequently reported 
post-treatment AEs (all with low incidences) were viral upper respiratory tract infection (0.3%, 0.9%, and 
0.4%, respectively), bronchitis (0.4% for all treatment groups), and upper respiratory tract infection (0.6%, 
0.4%, and 0.0%, respectively). Based on a review of post-treatment AEs in the pooled safety population and 
the supportive safety studies, no TEAEs were observed that are suggestive of rebound associated with 
cessation of dupilumab treatment and in particular, no rebound of asthma symptoms or lung dysfunction to 
above baseline levels. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To date, a total of 2649 patients were exposed to dupilumab during all conducted phase 2/3 asthma studies. 
The  safety  pool  derived  from  the  two  pivotal  studies  (QUEST  and  DRI12544)  comprises  2359  patients  of 
which 1567 received dupilumab and 792 were placebo-treated.  
The  clinical  development  program  for  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  persistent  asthma  comprises  7 
studies;  of  these,  data  from  5  Phase  2/3  studies  were  submitted  for  safety  assessment  (ACT11457, 
DRI12544, EFC13579, EFC13691 and LTS12551, TRAVERSE).  
The  pivotal  studies  DRI12544  (final  CSR)  and  EFC13579  (QUEST,  completed  primary  analysis)  were  pooled 
for safety analyses; pivotal study EFC13691 (VENTURE, completed primary analysis) was analysed separately 
since it comprises steroid-dependent patients. The treatment duration of both pooled studies varies between 
24  and  52  weeks,  however,  the  two  pooled  studies  were  similar  as  to  administered  dose  regimens  (200  or 
300  mg  q2w)  and  included  target  population  so  that  the  pooling  of  the  correspondent  safety  data  is 
endorsed.  The  MAH  presents  separate  analyses  that  explicitly  refer  to  a  24  week  treatment  period  of  the 
whole  safety  pool  which  is  acceptable.  The  presented  supportive  safety  data  (LTS12551,  ACT11457,  and 
R668-AD-1412)  provide  additional  information  on  long-term  safety  over  a  treatment  period  of  almost  three 
years  (Aug  14-Jul  17)  and  paediatric  patients  (EFC14153  and  AD-study  R668-AD-1412  for  PK  and  safety 
data).  
There is one ongoing OLE study (LTS12551, cut-off 29 July 2017) in asthma that provides further data on 
long-term safety regarding a dose of 300 mg q2w. 1844 patients were enrolled and treated since study 
initiation in Aug 2014. The available long-term data is rather extensive and the applicant sufficiently set out 
the ongoing and planned long - term safety considerations of the dupilumab development program 
concerning  the paediatric population. 
The total exposure of patients in the safety pool was balanced across the different treatment groups as well 
as  within  the  paediatric  treatment  population.  Adolescent’s  total  exposure  was  significantly  lower  compared 
to that of the treated adults (150 vs. 530 PY) due to the lower patient number (107 adolescents (QUEST) vs. 
1567 adults (DRI+QUEST). Administered doses during the phase 2/3 studies ranged from 200 mg q2w up to 
maximal  300  mg  qw.  The  highest  cumulative  dose  received  patients  participating  in  the  LTS12551  study 
(N=437, treatment duration ≥2 years).  The ICH E1 safety exposure requirements are met. 
The overall proportion of patients experiencing any TEAE was balanced across the different treatment groups. 
The asthma population showed a greater percentage of overall TEAE than the AD population in the primary 
safety pool (PSP) (ca. 80 % vs. 69%); the latter had a shorter treatment period though (24 vs. 16 weeks). 
Within  the  safety  pool  the  major  share  of  TEAE  is  attributable  to the  infections  and  infestations  SOC.  Here, 
the sub-items of infections were balanced and only minimally higher in the placebo group.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 142/161 
 
  
  
  
Differences  were  observed  regarding  the  ‘General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions’  whereof  the 
injection site reactions (erythema/oedema and pruritus) prevailed compared to the placebo group, as already 
observed in  the  AD  studies  and  during  the  administration of  other  subcutaneously  administered  monoclonal 
antibodies. Back pain and eosinophilia were observed more often in the dupilumab treatment groups.  
Interestingly  to  note  is  that  conjunctivitis,  as  seen  in  the  dupilumab-treated  AD  population,  did  not 
predominate  within  the  dupilumab  treatment  groups  of  the  asthma  patients  (1.5%  vs.  ca.  8%  in  the  AD 
programme). This observation supports the hypothesis that the conjunctivitis was rather associated with the 
underlying clinical condition of AD.  
All other SOCs showed nearly balanced and showed no special pattern of TEAE.  
TEAE type and incidence were consistent independent of the treatment duration. As to treatment-related AE 
(TRAE)  a  similar  pattern  was  existent  in  both  the  asthma  population  compared  to  the  AD  population 
regarding the pivotal studies as well as the steroid-dependent study population (VENTURE). 
The  SAE  rates  were  low  in  general  for  both  the  safety  pool  and  the  more  severely  affected  VENTURE 
population.  A  greater  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  the  higher  dupilumab  dose  experienced  SAEs. 
Asthma  was  the  most  common  SAE  and  exacerbations  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  dupilumab  200  mg 
and placebo group than in the 300 mg group. The incidences of the other most common SAEs (those with a 
frequency of >2 patients in any group) were low and similar across treatment arms. Besides, the SAE pattern 
did not significantly differ from the above presented TEAE pattern in the safety pool and again, it was similar 
to patients included in the VENTURE and OLE LTS12551 studies.  
15 deaths were reported in total in the asthma program: 8 cases (5 of the dupilumab treatment group/3 of 
placebo  group)  of  the  pooled  safety  population  died  following  a  SAE.  Most  were  associated  to 
comorbidities/risk factors, thus none of these were assessed to be related to IMP. 
2  deaths  occurred  during  DRI12544  study  in  the  300  mg  q4w  group,  which  were  not  related  to  the  study 
drug. Of the 3 deaths recorded during the OLE study LTS12551, 2 were assessed to be study-drug related:  
A case of lung cancer metastatic (this case was already presented during the initial MAA in the AD indication) 
and  one  case  of  gastric  adenocarcinoma.  Malignancy  is  listed  as  an  Important  Potential  Risk  in  the  current 
RMP  of  dupilumab  and  long-term  data  concerning  this  aspect  are  being  collected  during  the  ongoing  OLE 
study R-668-AD-1225 which has been prolonged from 3 up to 5 years.  
The remaining 2 cases were reported during screening and post-treatment phase without causal relationship 
to dupilumab.  
The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  SAE  was  worsening  of  asthma  with  similar  incidences 
across  placebo  and  treatment  group,  however,  patients  receiving  the  higher  dupilumab  dose  showed  the 
lowest incidence.  
The observed treatment differences of the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’ during the QUEST study lead the MAH to a 
deeper investigation regarding the relatedness of the cardiac events to the IMP; a database search combined 
with a blinded adjudication analysis did not reveal a causal relationship. Hitherto, the available data show no 
striking evidence that the risk of cardiovascular events may be increased by dupilumab. The time of 1st dose 
of  dupilumab  to  the  onset  of  cardiac  SAE  ranged  between  1  and  10  months,  so  no  clear  temporal  link 
between  dupilumab  dosing  and  SAE  could  be  established.  All  recorded  cases  of  the  TRAVERSE  study  were 
considered  to  be  unrelated  to  the  study  drug.  Neither  safety  results  of  the  conducted  AD  studies  nor  the 
analysis of the cumulative post-marketing experience via global safety database search seem to support the 
initial suspicion of a potential connection between cardiac SAE and dupilumab treatment so far. Certainly the 
interpretation of post-marketing data is hampered by the missing availability of precise case reports but no 
safety signals were triggered so far. On the basis of currently available data from ongoing clinical studies and 
post-marketing  experience  no  new  safety  concerns  with  regard  to  MACE/MACE+  especially  in  patients  with 
long-term use (LTS12551) were revealed. The further strategy is endorsed and thus, the issue solved.   
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 143/161 
  
  
  
Injection  site  reactions  (ISR)  clearly  constitute  the  largest  category  of  AESI;  the  incidence  remained  stable 
over time under dupilumab administration. Severe ISR (lasting longer than 24 hours) are considered to be an 
important potential risk and they belonged to the predefined AESI of the initial MAA in AD. Here, they were 
rare (1.4% in the 300 mg q2w group) in general and 0.6-1.6% discontinued the IMP due to an ISR. However, 
during the AD program only one patient included in the OLE study (R668-AD-1225 OLE study) was presented 
to have experienced a severe ISR; with regard to the similar dose and treatment duration (300 mg q2w, 52-
week  data)  only  14.5%  showed  ISR  whereas  20%  of  the  300  mg  q2w  treatment  group  of  the  asthma 
program had ISR.  
The  applicant  highlighted that  the  higher  discontinuation  rate  noted  in  patients  treated  with  300  mg  versus 
200 mg dosage is likely to be related to an increase in the incidence of ISRs. This possibly results from the 
higher volume of Dupixent administered with the 300 mg dose (2 ml versus 1.14 ml).  
The treatment-emergent AESI of eosinophilia up to greater 5 G/l due to a greater mean initial increase from 
baseline in blood eosinophils  were observed to be numerically higher in all dupilumab treatment groups 
compared to the placebo groups. This phenomenon is known to be associated with dupilumab treatment and 
was already discussed during the initial MA, it is therefore reflected as common ADR for AD in the RMP and 
SmPC. The proportion of patients experiencing a treatment-related eosinophilia observed in the pooled safety 
population was consistent to that one observed in the AD program (~1%).  
In the VENTURE study, the increase of eosinophils was considerably higher in patients with higher baseline 
levels (>0.5 G/l) and in patients with a higher disease burden. Thus, the effect and clinical consequences of a 
possible eosinophilia in patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia and with hypereosinophilic diseases has 
not been investigated to date. In addition, 8 patients showing a rise in blood eosinophils associated with 
clinically relevant moderate to severe adverse events and 4 cases experiencing eosinophilic pneumonia and 
EGPA (Churg-Strauss-Syndrome) were recorded. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Systemic dupilumab-related hypersensitivity occurred in 1 adolescent patient during the OLE study (enrolled 
from VENTURE), that led to treatment discontinuation. 1 case of dupilumab-related anaphylactic reaction was 
noted  in  the  pooled  safety  population.  In  total,  10  cases  of  systemic  hypersensitivity  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation, 3 were severe and 3 serious. Hence, systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely and 
seemed  to  be  manageable.  This  AESI  is  listed  under  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  and  as  an  ADR  which  is 
endorsed.  
Opportunistic infections were rare in general and patients of the dupilumab treatment groups showed similar 
incidences as the placebo groups. Concerning the severe infections similar results were obtained.  
Furthermore, there was no evidence of an elevated risk for malignancies or endoparasitosis. 
Basically, red blood cell and platelet counts seem to remain stable under dupilumab treatment apart from an 
observed  decrease  in  hemoglobin  which  was  more  pronounced  in  the  in  the  dupilumab  groups  and  most 
significant in the 300 mg q2w treatment group. According to the provided analysis, a decrease of hemoglobin 
>20 g/l occurred more often in patients with higher baseline haemoglobin levels independent of the assigned 
treatment.  An  anemia  resulted  in  the  same  proportion  of  patients  of  both  the  dupilumab  300  mg  q2w  and 
placebo  group.  This  effect  was  ascertainable  during  the  AD  development  program,  too.  These  data  do  not 
suggest a harmful effect of dupilumab on haemoglobin levels resulting in anemia.  
White blood cells counts did not change significantly from baseline under dupilumab treatment. Changes were 
higher in the dupilumab groups concerning the eosinophil and neutrophil counts. One case of neutropenia did 
not  result  in  a  higher  susceptibility  for  infections.  It  is  acknowledged  that  there  were  little  significant 
differences between dupilumab and placebo groups concerning the differential blood counts.According to the 
MAH,  the  different  percentages  between  the  asthma  and  AD  clinical  development  program  result  from  a 
different  analysis  method  (PCSA  criteria)  of  abnormal  blood  cell  counts  used  for  the  asthma  population 
compared to the AD indication.

The renal function in adolescents treated with dupixent due to divergent renal parameters (more patients of 
the verum group showing ≥ 30% change from baseline in creatinine compared to the placebo group) in 
Study EFC13579 and LTS12551 was questioned. As the change from baseline serum creatinine was not 
associated with renal adverse events or elevated creatinine levels (UNL) per se, no safety issue is currently 
discernible and no change to the SmPC was necessary. 
Three  cases  of  drug-related  CPK  increase  were  reported  whereof  2  led  to  treatment  discontinuation;  all 
patients  recovered  without  additional  intervention.  Overall,  there  were  no  striking  differences  between 
placebo and dupilumab treatment groups regarding the clinical chemistry parameters. 
No IMP-related alterations of vital signs and ECG were apparent during the studies. 
Overall,  approximately  6%  of  study  subjects  receiving  dupilumab  300  mg  q2w  and  5%  of  those  in  the 
placebo  groups  developed  ADA.  Treatment-emergent  ADA  response  was  slightly  higher  in  the  dupilumab 
treatment groups than in the placebo groups regarding the pooled ADA population. Concerning the TEAE no 
distinct pattern was discernible in ADA-positive study subjects apart from ISR which were in general higher in 
the  dupilumab  treatment  groups.  Overall,  few  patients  developed  ADA  and  persistent  titers  were  similar 
between  placebo  and  dupilumab  groups.  2-4%  treated  with  Dupixent  developed  neutralizing  antibody 
responses,  which  were  not  generally  associated  with  loss  of  efficacy.  No  clear  relationship  was  observed 
between anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions and ADA status.  
The spontaneous abortion rate registered during the dupilumab studies does not seem to exceed the general 
rate  and  was  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the  AD  program.  However,  dedicated  studies  analysing  the 
effect of dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes are hitherto missing and the number of pregnancies is 
too small to deduce a specific risk of adverse pregnancy effects of dupilumab. So far, no adverse effects on 
pregnancy  or  on  the  baby  could  be  determined.  The  same  applies  to  breastfeeding.  This  is  adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. A pregnancy registry was set up in the course of the initial MA. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No  increased  risk  was  apparent  for  TEAEs  with  dupilumab  treatment  compared  with  placebo  in  any  of  the 
intrinsic  factor  subgroups  examined  (i.e.,  age,  sex,  race,  weight,  BMI,  baseline  blood  eosinophil  level, 
baseline ACQ-5 scores, and the number of prior severe asthma exacerbations at baseline). The same applies 
to subgroups of regions and territories. 
The TEAE incidence in adolescents seems to be slightly lower than in adults and fewer TEAE were recorded in 
the dupilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo groups. No special TEAE pattern was identifiable so 
far.  The  same  applied  to  SAE  frequency  and  quality.  Supportive  data  coming  from  AD  study  1412  that 
included adolescents receiving two different weight-based doses did not reveal any special safety concerns.  
In  the  paediatric  population,    the  treatment-related  treatment-emergent  AE  (TEAE)  were  most  frequently 
noted  in  the  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  SOC  triggered  by  injection  site  reactions 
(injection  site  erythema  (8.8%)  injection  site  oedema  (8.8%),  and  injection  site  pain  (5.9%)  in  patients 
receiving dupilumab.  
The individual reasons for treatment discontinuation in the paediatric population didn’t reveal any special AE 
pattern and no significant percentage difference were recorded between the placebo and verum group. . 
Regarding the AESI only the injection site reactions prevailed in the dupilumab group which is consistent with 
the already presented safety results obtained from the treated paediatric patients. 
Supportive  blinded  paediatric  safety  data  of  study  EFC14153  were  provided  on  request.  As  far  as  could  be 
observed, no divergent AE pattern became apparent during study EFC14153. The 4 SAEs were considered as 
unrelated to the IMP (placebo or verum) as well as the majority of the remaining TEAE and AESI. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 145/161 
  
  
  
Available  paediatric  data  of  TRAVERSE  study  LTS12551  showed  similar  safety  data,  therefore  the  observed 
safety profile seem comparable to that seen in adults at present.   
Furthermore,  adolescents  showed  a  more  pronounced  decrease  in  neutrophil  counts  than  adults  which  was 
questioned.    After  correction  additional  15  adolescent  patients  were  included  in  the  whole  analysis  with 
regard to changes of the neutrophil blood counts. Seven of the nine adolescent patients showing a decreased 
neutrophil  count  had  associated  infections  which  were  probably  the  cause  for  the  neutropenia,  two  had  no 
associated clinical signs. One additional patient had a transient moderate neutropenia without clinical signs. 
Abnormalities of the neutrophil counts were slightly higher in the adolescent asthma population compared to 
the  adult  one  but  these  TEAE  were  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups.    Hence,  no  safety  issue  is 
suspected concerning this matter. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, dupilumab treatment appears to be well tolerated, including the dose and method of administration 
(200 and 300 mg q2w SC) proposed for licensing. The size of the safety database for dupilumab to support 
the indication in adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe asthma is considered sufficient. An 
ongoing open label extension study is being conducted that will provide further data on long-term safety in 
the post marketing setting.  
Treatment with dupilumab in the adult asthma placebo-controlled studies, during the open-label extension 
study and the supportive paediatric study was generally well tolerated and exhibited a relatively low 
immunogenic potential. Long-term safety considerations for dupilumab have been adequately addressed in 
this population and the SmPC is considered acceptable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
As agreed with EMA the applicant circulated the results of the user testing and bridging reports as part of the 
responses to LoQ at D 121. The approach was as follows: a bridging UT report for the 200 mg PFS-S package 
leaflet and IFU using the tested 300 mg PFS-S leaflet as parent leaflet. Furthermore, a bridging for the 200 
mg PFP package leaflet using the already tested 300 mg PFS-S leaflet and a full user test for the 200 mg PFP. 
With regard to the extension “ new asthma indication with new strength and additional presentation as pre-
filled pen” the applicant Sanofi-Aventis Groupe submitted a full user test for the package leaflet including the 
IFU section for the medicinal product Dupixent 200 mg solution for injection in PFP. A previous readability 
test was carried out in 2016 for Dupixent 300 mg solution for injection in a PFS. The contractor used the 
same methodology as before. 
Unfortunately the full user testing failed due to the results related to several questions. The company 
selected various participants which were regularly involved (13 to 15 times previously) but the inclusion of 
well-trained persons should be avoided as much as possible. With regard to question 2 and in particular to 
question 7 the time aspects exceeded the limit of 120 seconds considerably: Participant number 20  (P20) = 
263 and P11 = 259 seconds, this means more than 4 minutes, P2 = 227, P18= 211, and P3= 200 seconds, 
this means more than 3 minutes and P20 = 172, P1=154, P4=153, P6=146, P=8=136, etc -> more than 2 
minutes. Therefore the testing failed regrettably.    
The readability guideline is clear as well as the QRD checklist. However, a satisfactory test outcome could not 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 150/161 
 
  
  
  
be demonstrated: when the information requested within the package leaflet can be found by 90% of the test 
participants, of whom 90% can show that they understand it. That means to have 16 out of 20 participants 
able to find the information and answer each question correctly and act appropriately. The success criteria 
will need to be achieved with each question and the results cannot be aggregated.  
Therefore, the company is requested to carry out a consultation with target patient groups which reflect all 
issues sufficiently. The main focus of the readability testing is to achieve a legible, clear and easy to use 
package leaflet in order to avoid medication errors and that the suggestions made by the volunteers will be 
taken into consideration or otherwise adequately justified. 
In conclusion, the MAH will submit the results of a new user consultation with target patient groups on the 
package leaflet that meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use as soon as possible and no later than Q3 2019. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Dupixent (dupilumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, acute 
and chronic bronchoconstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging. The inflammatory component of 
asthma involves many cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial 
cells and their biological products. 
The poor response of some patients with asthma to the standard regimen of controller and reliever therapies 
may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. Type 2 inflammation is 
characterized by the release of signature cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 13 (IL-13) and interleukin 
5 (IL-5). While IL-5 primarily functions to increase release of eosinophils from bone marrow, IL-4 and IL-13 
have effects on multiple cellular pathways, working via both the innate and adaptive immune pathways, 
leading to mast cell activation, IgE production, eosinophil recruitment into tissues via increasing levels of 
chemokines such as eotaxin, and increased smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness and remodeling. Type 2 
inflammation asthma is associated with elevated levels in related biomarkers (e.g. Eosinophil count in blood 
or sputum, FeNO, TARC, periostin, eotaxin-3). Current asthma treatment guidelines support using Eosinophil 
count and FeNO as patient response biomarker that can identify patients with Type 2 inflammation. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is a recognized ceiling effect for what can be achieved with ICS/LABA combinations. It has been shown 
that if patients remain uncontrolled on high doses of ICS, further dose increases provide little incremental 
benefit.  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 151/161 
  
  
  
For patients with uncontrolled asthma, ICSs often fail to normalize elevated Type 2 biomarkers in blood, 
exhaled air and/or induced sputum, indicating persistence of significant residual Type 2 inflammation. 
Combination of ICS +LABA show some improvement on FEV1 due to their bronchodilator effect. LAMA add-on 
may have additional benefits on lung function and asthma control over LABA/ICS; however, their effects in 
reducing the need for rescue oral steroids and benefits on quality of life are inconsistent and negligible. 
Thirty percent of severe asthmatics currently require oral steroids to control their asthma symptoms. Though 
moderately effective in the majority of cases to control airway disease, the broad spectrum anti-inflammatory 
activity of OCS has a well-known toxicity profile across multiple organ systems. There remains a significant 
need to develop therapies that can be used earlier, after ICS +/- LABA, for those moderate-to-severe 
patients who currently are not severe enough to warrant OCS use, and to prevent the need for oral 
corticosteroid use in the most severe asthmatics who would otherwise have no choice but accept the risks of 
OCS use.  Biologics targeting specific inflammatory mediators of asthma are used as add-on treatments and 
are currently limited to subgroups of patients. Omalizumab, which inhibits the binding of IgE to its receptor, 
is indicated in the EU as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients (adult and children aged ≥6 
years) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial 
aeroallergen. More recently approved biologics include the IL-5 inhibitors mepolizumab, reslizumab, and 
benralizumab. These IL-5 inhibitor therapies are indicated only for patients with elevated blood eosinophils. 
The results of these clinical studies demonstrate an ability to reduce exacerbations in a targeted group of 
asthmatics but also highlight their inability to treat a broader range of asthmatics whose disease is driven by 
a more complex network of cellular inflammation. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Three pivotal studies are included in the submission. DRI12544 a 24-week Phase 2b, placebo-controlled dose 
ranging  in  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  uncontrolled  asthma,    EFC13579  (QUEST)  a  52-week  Phase  3, 
placebo-controlled  study  in  patients  with  persistent  (moderate-to-severe  uncontrolled)  asthma.  It  was  a 
confirmatory efficacy and safety study with the primary analysis completed (data cutoff of 29 July 2017) and 
EFC13691  (VENTURE)  was  a  24-week  Phase  3,  placebo-controlled  study  in  patients  with  severe  steroid-
dependent  asthma.  The  end-of-treatment  (EOT)  analyses  were  completed  (data  cutoff  of  20  September 
2017).  
A  total  of  2649  patients  were  exposed  to  dupilumab  of  which  2136,  1553,  834,  and  531  patients  were 
exposed for ≥6 months (24 weeks), ≥1 year, ≥1.5 years, and ≥2 years (96 weeks), respectively. A total of 
110  (5.2%)  adolescents  (12  to  <18  years,  in  Studies  EFC13579  and  EFC13691)  and  353  (12.2%)  elderly 
(≥65 years) patients were randomized and treated. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dupilumab treatment reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved lung function in all 3 pivotal 
studies for the overall population in both 200mg and 300mg Q2W regimens. 
In study DRI12544 and EFC13579 both 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w doses of dupilumab, when added to 
standard of care to patients with persistent, uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma, demonstrated 
clinically meaningful effects on primary endpoints and most other secondary endpoints including patient 
reported outcomes. 
Dose-Response-Study DRI12544 demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in FEV1 at week 12 
(primary efficacy endpoint) of the 2 highest doses of dupilumab compared to placebo. Furthermore both the 
200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dose regimens of dupilumab demonstrated, as compared to placebo, a 
significant reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations and a delayed time to first severe 
asthma exacerbation event, during the treatment period. The LS mean changes in FEV1 from baseline to 
Week 12 were +0.12 L in the placebo group, +0.31 L (200 mg Q2W dose) and +0.28 L (300mg Q2W dose).  
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 152/161 
 
  
  
  
When compared with placebo, the LS mean differences were significant for dupilumab 200 mg Q2W (+0.20 
L; p<0.0001), and 300 mg Q2W (+0.16 L; p=0.0002). The number of patients with severe exacerbation over 
the treatment period 25.9% in the placebo group, 8.8% in the 200 mg Q2W and 10.9% in the 300mg Q2W 
group. 
In Study EFC13579 the reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 47.7% and 
46.0%, for the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with the matching placebo 
groups (p<0.0001 for both dose groups). The improvement in in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 was 
observed for the 200 mg q2w group (0.14 L) and for the 300 mg q2w group (0.13 L) in the overall ITT 
population over the matching placebo groups (p<0.0001). Higher efficacy was demonstrated in patients with 
higher blood eosinophil and FeNO values at baseline. . A post hoc analysis to examine the interaction 
between these baseline biomarkers demonstrated that the greatest effect of dupilumab on annualized severe 
exacerbation event rate and on change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was observed 
among the patients with baseline eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L and FeNO ≥25 ppb. This population of patients 
(41.7% of the entire ITT population) showed a risk reduction of 68.2% and 65.3% and an LS mean difference 
of 0.26 L and 0.26 L in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups 
compared with the matching placebo groups, while those with blood eosinophils <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO < 25 
ppb do not demonstrate a clinically meaningful improvement in exacerbation rate or lung function. 
In study EFC13691 dupilumab was administered to patients with OCS dependent asthma. The primary 
endpoint was percentage reduction from baseline in OCS dose at Week 24. The mean percent reduction in 
OCS dose at Week 24 was greater in the dupilumab group (LS mean 70.09) compared with the placebo group 
(LS mean 41.85). The results of the  secondary endpoints support the results of the primary endpoint and 
showed, that at Week 24, the proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with 
baseline was significantly greater in the dupilumab group (80%) than in the placebo group (50%).  
In study EFC13579 and EFC13691 adolescent patients over 12 years of age with a physician diagnosis of 
asthma for ≥12 months (based on the GINA 2014 Guidelines) were eligible. The adjusted annualized event 
rate of severe exacerbation in the 107 adolescent patients during the 52-week treatment period of Study 
EFC13579 was lower in the dupilumab 200 mg q2w group compared with the matching placebo groups 
(0.191 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w compared with 0.356 for the matching placebo group), indicating a 
46.4% reduced risk of severe exacerbation events. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
 In study DRI12544 and EFC13579 the 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W showed similar efficacy in reducing 
the annual rate of exacerbations and improving the pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in patients with type 2 
inflammation asthma treated with ICS plus another inhaler controller for maintenance treatment. In Study 
EFC13579 the reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 47.7% and 46.0%, for 
the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups, respectively, compared with the matching placebo groups 
(p<0.0001 for both dose groups). The improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 was 0.14 L for 
the 200 mg q2w group and 0.13 L for the 300 mg q2w group in the overall ITT population over the matching 
placebo groups (p<0.0001). No additional benefit for patients with the higher dose of 300 mg Q2W has been 
identified in these studies. Due to this fact and together with a slightly better safety profile the benefit/risk 
ratio is in favour of the 200 mg dose in these patientsDue to this fact and together with a slightly better 
safety profile the benefit/risk ratio is in favour of the 200 mg dose in these patients. 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 153/161 
  
  
  
Higher efficacy has been demonstrated in the subpopulation with higher baseline eosinophils and FeNO 
values. In study EFC13579 patients with both eosinophil levels <0.15 Giga/L and FeNO <25 ppb, dupilumab 
did not demonstrate any relevant effect in reducing the risk of exacerbations. A statistically significant 
difference was not observed in the adjusted annualized event rate of severe exacerbation during the 52-week 
treatment period between the 2 dupilumab dose groups compared with their respective placebo groups 
(0.512 and 0.610 for the dupilumab 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w groups compared with 0.675 and 0.732 
for the matching placebo groups). The recruited patients had moderate to severe asthma both with high and 
low eosinophil baseline counts and it would appear that the efficacy favours patients with uncontrolled  
asthma with elevated levels of eosinophils and frequent (≥ 2) severe exacerbations. The main Phase 3 study 
EFC13579 the subgroup with eosinophil < 0.3 Giga /L did not show a clinically significant reduction in 
exacerbations compared to placebo whereas this was demonstrated in the high eosinophil group > 0.3 Giga/L 
and therefore drives the overall ITT result.  
Exacerbation events leading to hospitalisation or emergency room visit were very low the relative risk 
reduction of dupilumab versus placebo was 25.5% and 46.9% for the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w doses, 
respectively. In OCS-dependent patients (Study EFC13691) treated with 300 mg q2w dupilumab, the relative 
risk reduction versus placebo was 42.3% although the reduction did not reach statistical significance 
(nominal p =0.397) due to a small number of events. While the effects of Dupilumab in patients taking oral 
steroids in study EFC13691 were encouraging and meaningful the study was relatively small (106 patients) 
and was of short duration (26 weeks) therefore a maintenance of effect was not demonstrated sufficiently for 
a specific claim in the indication (section 4.1). However it is agreed that the effects should be conveyed to 
physicians and this information has been incorporated into section 5.1. 
In study EFC13691 dupilumab treatment significantly reduced the need for oral corticosteroids in OCS 
dependent patients. However, due to the small sample size it was unclear whether this effect was 
independent from type 2 inflammation biomarkers (i.e. blood eosinophils and FeNO) since only 22 patients 
had low eosinophils count (<0.15 G/L) at baseline.  
Use in elderly patients > 65 years of age is limited. Also the trials limited recruitment in relation to smokers 
as current smoker or cessation of smoking within 6 months were excluded. 
The applicant only conducted this study using the higher dose of 300mg Q2W and it is not known whether 
similar results could have been achieved with 200mg Q2W. Also there were limited number of patients in 
both subgroups and 50% of placebo treated patients achieved a ≥50% reduction in OCS dose compared with 
baseline which questions whether some of the patients were over treated on enrolment.  
Finally it is not clear what the duration of effect is following withdrawal of treatment and whether any 
rebound effect would occur if patients needed to be taken off therapy for duration of time. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
3 deaths occurred during the OLE study LTS12551 whereof 2 were assessed to be related to dupilumab: one 
case of lung cancer and one case of gastric adenocarcinoma. The impact of Dupilumab on malignancy cannot 
be assessed conclusively to date because long-term safety data are not yet available. Malignancy is therefore 
covered in the current RMP as Important Potential Risk and is subject of further investigations (OLE study R-
668-AD-1225 which is set up for 5 years).  
8% of patients independent of the study treatment experienced Serious AEs. Asthma was the most common 
SAE, ranging between 0.9 in the 300 mg q2w group, 2.1% in the 200 m q2w group and 2.3% in the placebo 
group. Severe TEAE were almost balanced between the treatment groups, asthma exacerbations occurred 
more frequently in the dupilumab 200 mg and placebo group than in the 300 mg group (1.3% vs. 0.6%). The 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 154/161 
 
  
  
  
SAE pattern was similar to the general TEAE pattern in the safety pool and it did not differ from that observed 
in patients included in the VENTURE and OLE studies.  
The observed treatment differences of AE of the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’ during the QUEST study were 
subject to a closer analysis regarding the relatedness of the cardiac events to the IMP. According to the 
presented data no striking evidence of any relatedness to dupilumab could be determined.   
Injection site reactions (ISR) were the most common AESI. Their incidence remained stable over time under 
dupilumab administration. Severe ISR were rare (1.4% in the 300 mg q2w group) and 0.6-1.6% discontinued 
the IMP due to an ISR. However, a rise in ISR incidence can be observed compared to the AD program 
referred to similar dosage and treatment duration (14.5% vs. 20% of the 300 mg q2w treatment group of 
the asthma program) that might be related to the different drug formulation. 
Eosinophilia up to or greater 5 G/l due to a greater mean initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophils 
that were observed to be numerically higher in all dupilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo 
groups. This phenomenon is known to be associated with dupilumab treatment. The increase of eosinophils 
was considerably higher in patients with higher baseline levels (>0.5 G/l) and in patients with a higher 
disease burden (VENTURE study). Patients with eosinophil counts >1.5 G/l were excluded from participation 
in the pivotal Phase III studies QUEST and VENTURE; thus, the effect and clinical consequences of a possible 
eosinophilia in patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia and with hypereosinophilic diseases has not been 
investigated. This safety concern is mirrored in the SmPC in section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 and in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. 
Red blood cell and platelet counts seem to remain stable under dupilumab treatment apart from an observed 
decrease in hemoglobin which was more pronounced in the in the dupilumab groups and most significant in 
the 300 mg q2w treatment group. Further explanation was requested to clarify if the decrease of > 20 g/l in 
almost 11% of the pooled safety population led to anemia or clinical signs.  
According to the provided analysis, a decrease of hemoglobin >20 g/l occurred more often in patients with 
higher baseline haemoglobin levels independent of the assigned treatment. An anemia resulted in the same 
proportion of patients of both the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and placebo group. This effect was ascertainable 
during the AD development program, too. These data do not suggest a harmful effect of dupilumab on 
haemoglobin levels resulting in anemia. 
Changes in WCB counts were higher in the dupilumab groups concerning the eosinophil and neutrophil 
counts. Percentages are significantly higher than in the AD program. According to the MAH, the different 
percentages concerning the recorded abnormal blood cell counts between the asthma and AD clinical 
development program result from a different analysis method (PCSA criteria) of abnormal blood cell counts 
used for the asthma population compared to the AD indication.  Furthermore, adolescents showed a more 
pronounced decrease in neutrophil counts than adults; these were not accompanied or followed by clinical 
issues. 
Overall, approximately 6% of study subjects receiving dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 5% of those in the 
placebo groups developed ADA. Treatment-emergent ADA response was slightly higher in the dupilumab 
treatment groups than in the placebo groups regarding the pooled ADA population. Concerning the TEAE no 
distinct pattern was discernible in ADA-positive study subjects apart from ISR which were in general higher in 
the dupilumab treatment groups (see assessment above). Overall, few patients developed ADA and 
persistent titers were similar between placebo and dupilumab groups. 2-4% treated with Dupixent developed 
neutralizing antibody responses. No clear relationship was observed between anaphylactic or hypersensitivity 
reactions and ADA status.  
The spontaneous abortion rate registered during the dupilumab studies does not seem to exceed the general 
rate and was consistent with that observed in the AD program. The number of pregnancies is too small to 
EMA/188111/2019 
Page 155/161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
deduce a specific risk of adverse pregnancy effects of dupilumab. So far, no adverse effects on pregnancy or 
on the baby could be determined. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Paediatric data is limited to 107 patients. 
Based on the currently available data there was no significantly increased risk detectable for dupilumab 
regarding malignancy, all types of infections or systemic hypersensitivity reactions. The immunogenic 
potential of dupilumab seems to be low. However, the safety profile has to be refined over the next years 
with more data coming from the ongoing open label extension trials in asthma and AD as outlined in the RMP. 
Currently there is a limited amount of safety data for the elderly (>64 years) and other special populations 
such as pregnant women, children under 12 years of age and patients with organ impairment. Further data 
are generated in the post-marketing setting with the ongoing trial. 
Effects of dupilumab on patients with hypereosinophilic conditions have not been investigated as stated in the 
SmPC. 
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity. However, data from use of dupilumab is too limited to 
draw any conclusions on potential embryo-foetal harms. This is reflected in the SmPC.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Dupilumab is a first-in-class drug with a new mechanism of action and can provide an alternative treatment 
option for patients. 
Dupilumab treatment reduced severe asthma exacerbations and improved lung function in all 3 pivotal 
studies for the overall population in both 200mg and 300mg Q2W regimens. Improvement in lung function 
and the reduction of exacerbations are the clinically relevant aims of the asthma treatment. Additionally the 
reduction of systemic corticosteroid dose in patients with systemic corticosteroid dependent diseases is 
clinically important, due to the possible side effects of higher dose chronic systemic corticosteroid use. 
The overall population is rather heterogeneous and it appears that the effects on both exacerbation and lung 
function are most favourable for patients with blood eosinophils > 0.3 Giga/L as they achieved significant 
results. In the pivotal study the difference from placebo in annualised rate of severe exacerbations was in the 
region of -0.43 for overall population however in the subpopulation baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 0.3 Giga/L 
the difference was 0.77 whereas for the baseline blood eosinophils < 0.3 Giga/L it was 0.14. In the 
subpopulation with eosinophils ≥ 0.15 Giga/L the difference was 0.60 whereas for baseline blood eosinophils 
<0.15 Giga/L, it was 0.03.  However, similar effects were seen in patients receiving moderate and high ICS 
therapy. In the OCS sparing study EFC13691 the difference from placebo was -1.24 and -0.66 in the baseline 
EMA/188111/2019

blood eosinophils ≥ 0.3 Giga/L and <0.3 Giga/L respectively. Although it could be considered clinically 
meaningful in the <0.3 Giga/L group, it has to be considered with caution as there were a limited number of 
patients and the duration was only for 24 weeks. 
For effects on lung function change from baseline in pre bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12, the overall ITT 
population form the main pivotal study showed an improvement of between 130 to 140 ml compared to 
placebo. In relation to the subgroups the effects demonstrated were more favourable for patients with 
baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.3 Giga/L as they achieved results between 210 to 240 mls compared to 
placebo whereas the population with <0.3 Giga/L only achieved differences of 4 to 8mls. Patients with 
baseline blood eosinophils ≥0.15 Giga/L achieved results between 150 to 170 mls compared to placebo 
whereas the population with <0.15 Giga/L only achieved differences of 6 to 9 mls. 
The effects on lung function appear to improve rapidly 2-4 weeks and appear to be sustained over time to 52 
weeks. Outcomes of total asthma symptom score and ACQ-5 score, significantly greater responder rate 
compared to placebo was observed for both dupilumab doses, based on the responder definition as 
improvement of ACQ-5 by 0.5, which is considered MCID. Although clinically meaningful effects were seen in 
patients with and without an eosinophilic phenotype, greater treatment effects in the subgroup of patients 
with baseline blood eosinophil ≥0.3 Giga/L compared to the overall ITT population were reported in all 3 
pivotal studies. 
The patient reported outcomes showed an improvement in Quality of life of the patient population similar to 
the efficacy endpoints. 
The most relevant safety concerns identified during the asthma program are related to injection site 
reactions, potential risk of malignancy, limited long term data in paediatric and elderly adult patients, and 
uncertainties about the impact of dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes.  
In terms of infections the overall rate was lower in the dupilumab treated patients compared with the placebo 
group. These were generally mild to moderate and common viral infections prevailed. No increased risk for 
helminth or opportunistic infections was identified. No treatment group differences were observed in the 
incidence of conjunctivitis concerning the asthma population. 
Dupilumab use was not associated with a higher risk of experiencing TEAEs of hypersensitivity. Systemic 
hypersensitivity rates in the dupilumab treatment groups were low and similar to placebo. A single case of 
treatment-related anaphylaxis occurred. This suggests a low immunogenic potential of dupilumab in the 
asthma population and were mainly locally restricted. The proposed SmPC contraindicates use in patient with 
known hypersensitivity and incudes a warning in section 4.4 which is reasonable and endorsed by the CHMP.  
The overall rates of malignancy were very low and comparable across treatment groups. However, there is 
insufficient long term exposure data to characterise the risk of developing malignancy particularly at the dose 
proposed. This issue has been discussed during the initial MA for AD and is part of the RMP and subject to 
investigation in the OLE studies. 
The toxicity of dupilumab seems to be low with only minor ADRs identified. Despite its immunogenicity, 
hypersensitivity reactions were mainly locally restricted. 
Long-term exposure at the intended dose of dupilumab 300mg Q2W is limited to date, especially for elderly 
and the paediatric population. The paediatric data show a similar safety profile compared with that seen in 
the adult population. The applicant should ensured that long term safety considerations for dupilumab are 
adequately addressed in this population.

3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the data provided on efficacy and safety, and considering the uncertainties in relation to safety and 
efficacy, the therapeutic need of dupilumab in the asthma population is acknowledged. The CHMP considers 
that the favourable effects of the 200 mg Q2W in the overall ITT population and 300 mg Q2W in the 
population with severe asthma type II patients who are treated with oral systemic corticosteroids and with 
concomitant moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  outweigh the unfavourable effects. Hence, the benefit/risk 
balance is deemed positive in this population. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dupixent is positive in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  patients as add-on 
maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised eosinophils 
and/or raised FeNO (see section 5.1), who are inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another 
medicinal product for maintenance treatment.”. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Dupixent of 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with safety system 
(PFS-S) and pre-filled pen (PFP) and new indication is favourable in:  “adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older  patients as add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised 
by raised eosinophils and/or raised FeNO (see section 5.1), who are inadequately controlled with high dose 
ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.”. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Dupixent subject to the 
following conditions:

Extension application to add a new strength of 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with safety 
system (PFS-S) and pre-filled pen (PFP), grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to add the following 
indication in severe asthma patients based on the pivotal studies DRI12544, QUEST and VENTURE: 
Dupixent is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older  as add-on maintenance treatment for 
severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised eosinophils and/or raised FeNO (see section 
5.1), who are inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance 
treatment. 
Therefore, the above indication is approved for the new strength (200 mg) and the existing strength 
(300 mg) where the SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated accordingly. The 
Package Leaflet and RMP (version 2.0) were updated accordingly.

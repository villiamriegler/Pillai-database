Riximyo (rituximab) 
An overview of Riximyo and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is Riximyo and what is it used for? 
Riximyo is a medicine used to treat the following blood cancers and inflammatory conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (two types of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, a blood cancer); 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, another blood cancer affecting white blood cells); 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA or Wegener’s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA), which are inflammatory conditions of the blood vessels; 
pemphigus vulgaris, a serious condition involving widespread blistering of the skin and lining of the 
mouth, nose, throat and genitals. 
Depending on the condition it is used to treat, Riximyo may be given on its own, or with chemotherapy 
(cancer medicines) or medicines used for inflammatory disorders (corticosteroids).  
Riximyo contains the active substance rituximab. 
Riximyo is a ‘biosimilar medicine’. This means that Riximyo is highly similar to another biological 
medicine (the ‘reference medicine’) that is already authorised in the EU. The reference medicine for 
Riximyo is MabThera. For more information on biosimilar medicines, see here. 
How is Riximyo used? 
Riximyo can only be obtained with a prescription. It should be given under the close supervision of an 
experienced healthcare professional and in a place where facilities for resuscitating patients are 
immediately available. The medicine is available for infusion (drip) into a vein. 
Before each infusion, the patient should be given an antihistamine (to prevent allergic reactions) and 
an antipyretic (a medicine to reduce fever). Depending on the condition being treated, the patients are 
also given other medicines to manage side effects.

How does Riximyo work? 
The active substance in Riximyo, rituximab, is a monoclonal antibody designed to attach to a protein 
called CD20, which is present on B cells. When rituximab attaches to CD20, it causes the B cells to die, 
which helps in lymphoma and CLL (where B cells have become cancerous) and in pemphigus (where B 
cells are involved in inflammation). In GPA and MPA, destroying B cells lowers the production of 
antibodies thought to play an important role in attacking the blood vessels and causing inflammation. 
What benefits of Riximyo have been shown in studies? 
Laboratory studies comparing Riximyo with the reference medicine MabThera have shown that the 
active substance in Riximyo is highly similar to that in MabThera in terms of structure, purity and 
biological activity. Studies have also shown that giving Riximyo produces similar levels of the active 
substance in the body to giving MabThera. 
In addition, Riximyo was as effective as MabThera in one main study involving 629 patients with 
advanced, untreated follicular lymphoma, where Riximyo or MabThera were added to other 
chemotherapy for part of the treatment. The cancer improved in just over 87% of those given Riximyo 
(271 of 311 patients), and in similar numbers of those given MabThera (274 of 313 patients). 
Because Riximyo is a biosimilar medicine, the studies on effectiveness and safety of rituximab carried 
out with MabThera do not all need to be repeated for Riximyo. 
What are the risks associated with Riximyo? 
The safety of Riximyo has been evaluated, and on the basis of all the studies carried out, the side 
effects of the medicine are considered to be comparable to those of the reference medicine MabThera. 
The most common side effects with Riximyo are reactions related to the infusion (such as fever, chills 
and shivering) while most common serious side effects are infusion reactions, infections and heart-
related problems.  
Riximyo must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to rituximab, mouse proteins or 
any of the other ingredients or in patients with a severe infection or a severely weakened immune 
system (the body’s defences). Patients with GPA, MPA or pemphigus vulgaris must also not receive 
Riximyo if they have severe heart problems. 
For the full list of side effects and restrictions of Riximyo, see the package leaflet.  
Why is Riximyo authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency decided that, in accordance with EU requirements for biosimilar 
medicines, Riximyo has a highly similar structure, purity and biological activity to MabThera and is 
distributed in the body in the same way. In addition, a study in patients with follicular lymphoma has 
shown that the safety and effectiveness of Riximyo are equivalent to those of MabThera. 
All these data were considered sufficient to conclude that Riximyo will behave in the same way as 
MabThera in terms of effectiveness and safety in its authorised uses. Therefore, the Agency’s view was 
that, as for MabThera, the benefits of Riximyo outweigh the identified risks and it can be authorised for 
use in the EU.

What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Riximyo? 
The company marketing Riximyo will provide doctors with additional information about giving the 
medicine correctly. It will also provide doctors and patients using the medicine for GPA, MPA or 
pemphigus with educational material on the risk of infection including that of a rare severe infection, 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). These patients are also to receive an alert card, 
which they are to carry at all times, instructing them to contact their doctor immediately if they have 
symptoms of infection. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Riximyo have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and the 
package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Riximyo are continuously monitored. Side effects reported with 
Riximyo are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients. 
Other information about Riximyo

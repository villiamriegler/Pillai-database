are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of the Product information  to provide the 
final clinical study report (CSR) Part A of Study 
VX17- 
661-116 (A Phase 3, Open-label, Rollover Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Long-term 
Treatment With Tezacaftor in Combination With 
Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Aged 6 
Years 
and Older, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR Mutation).  
Consequently the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 
5.1 and the package leaflet are updated accordingly.  
The RMP is also updated. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and tolerability of Tezacaftor in combination with Ivacaftor 
in CF subjects 6 years of age and older, homozygous or 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation. A total of 130 
subjects were enrolled. 
The treatment effects observed were generally consistent 
with those previously observed in CF subjects 6 through 11 
years of age with F/F and F/RF genotypes. In particular, the 
improvements observed in the parent studies (Studies 
113B and 115) in LCI2.5, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score and BMI z-
score were maintained or improved slightly over 96 weeks 
of treatment, and BMI improved during the treatment 
period of up to 120 weeks. Overall, the safety profile was in 
line with the known safety profile of Symkevi and Kalydeco. 
These results are added in section 5.1 of Symkevi SmPC, 
and the study is mentioned in section 4.8 of Symkevi SmPC 
and section 5.1 of Kalydeco SmPC.For more information,

study in the RMP; this is a phase 3, multicenter, 
open label, rollover study for studies 103, 106, 107, 
108, 109, 111, 112, and 114 designed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and tolerability of tezacaftor / 
ivacaftor (Symkevi) treatment for 96 weeks in cystic 
fibrosis (CF) subjects 12 years and older, 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del CFTR 
mutation. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in 
line with the latest QRD template version 10.1 and to 
introduce minor editorial changes. The RMP version 
2.3 has also been submitted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

also updated to reflect that patients who received placebo 
in both study 1 and study 2 demonstrated improvements in 
ppFEV1 when treated with Symkevi in combination with 
ivacaftor in study 3 [Study 1: within group 
change=2.1(95% CI: 0.8, 3.3) percentage points, study 2: 
within group change=4.1 (95% CI: 2.2, 6.0)) percentage 
points]. Further, patients who received Symkevi in 
combination with ivacaftor in the parent studies and 
continued on treatment, showed a slight attenuation in 
ppFEV1 in the extension study, however the overall 
treatment effect was still positive through 120 weeks and 
104 weeks for study 1 and study 2, respectively. Studies 1, 
2 and 3 are further described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

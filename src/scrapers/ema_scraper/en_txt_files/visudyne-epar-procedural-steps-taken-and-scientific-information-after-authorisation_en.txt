Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
were retrieved in Novartis' global safety database. 
In some cases the event took place within the first month 
of therapy and patients had no previous history of RPET. 
After analysis of these cases, the relationship between 
Visudyne and RPE tear cannot be totally excluded. For this 
reason "retinal pigment epithelial tear" has been included 
as an adverse reaction to Visudyne treatment in section 4.8 
of the SPC.

SmPC, 
Please refer to the Scientific Discussion H-305-II-53-AR 
(SPC) according to the 24 months results of the VIO 
study conducted in the occult indication as post-
approval commitment for Visudyne. As a result, the 
Therapeutic Indication section (4.1) of the SPC has 
been amended to delete the indication "treatment of 
patients with subfoveal occult CNV due to AMD with 
evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression". 
Section 5.1 was also updated. The PL (Package

subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to age-related 
macular degeneration was based on the 2-year results of 
the clinical studies BPD OCR 002 A and 002 B (TAP) in 
which a total of 609 adult patients participated ( 402 were 
randomised to verteporfin and 207 to placebo). Study 
BPD952A2301 was a 3 year open label extension of TAP A 
and TAP B studies. The TAP Extension study included 476 
patients in total. Of these patients 320 were long term 
verteporfin-treated patients; 134 were "previously placebo" 
patients treated with verteporfin; 22 "previously placebo" 
patients not treated with verteporfin.In patients followed 
from Month 24 onwards and treated with uncontrolled, 
open-label Visudyne treatment as needed, long-term 
extension data suggest that Month 24 vision outcomes may

be sustained for up to 60 Months. In the TAP study in all 
lesion types, the average number of treatments per year 
was 3.5 in the first year after diagnosis and 2.4 in the 
second for the randomised placebo-controlled phase and 
1.34 in the third phase, 0.4 in the fourth and 0.1 in the fifth 
year for the open label extension phase. No additional 
safety concern was identified.The Package Leaflet has been 
amended accordingly.

that the MAH should provide a safety overview on vision

Visudyne

SPC provided guidance on precautions to avoid 
photosensitivity reactions and lists examples of bright light 
sources which could cause photosensitivity reactions. Two 
publications document photosensitivity reactions following 
use of pulse-oximeters, in patients who had undergone 
photodynamic therapy. For this reason "prolonged exposure 
to light from light emitting medical devices such as pulse 
oximeters should also be avoided for 48 hours following 
Visudyne administration" was added in section 4.4.Infusion 
related back/ chest pain was evaluated in PSUR 5 and 
previous PSURs and the MAH proposed a rewording of the 
description of the infusion related pain.Extravasation of 
verteporfin can lead to local photosensitivity reactions if the 
extravasation area is exposed to light. The MAH proposed 
to add to the warning regarding extravasation in section 
4.4 of the SPC "especially if exposed to light". This

eyes with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation was 
approved on the basis of the one-year results of the 
controlled study BPD OCR 003 PM (VIP) in which a total of 
120 adult patients participated (81 were randomized to 
verteporfin and 39 to placebo). In order to confirm the one-
year results, a second analysis was performed when all 
patients had completed 2 years of follow-up. On the basis 
of the 2-year results provided by the MAH in July 2001 the 
CHMP concluded that the difference between treatment 
groups, for visual acuity (mean, median or distribution of 
changes) examined in its entirety, remained favourable for 
verteporfin during the 2-year study duration, although, the 
responder rate was lower than the responder rate at 1 
year.  The MAH submitted in this variation the results of 
the 3 year follow up study (BPD952A2302), an open label 
extension study in patients with subfoveal choroidal 
neovascularisation due to pathological myopia. The VIP-PM 
Extension study included 96 (80%) of the 120 patients 
included in the BPD OCR 003 PM (VIP) study. Of the 81 
verteporfin-treated patients, who participated in the BPD 
OCR 003 PM (VIP) study, 67 (83%) enrolled in the VIP-PM 
Extension study.In patients followed from Month 24 
onwards and treated with uncontrolled, open-label 
Visudyne treatment as needed, long-term extension data 
suggest that Month 24 vision outcomes may be sustained 
for up to 60 months. The average number of treatments 
Page 20/23 
 
 
 
 
 
per year was in the randomised placebo-controlled phase 
3.5 in the first year after diagnosis, 1.8 in the second and 
in the open label extension phase 0.4 in the third year, 0.2 
in the fourth and 0.1 in the fifth. No additional safety 
concern was identified.The Package Leaflet has been 
amended accordingly.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant FGK Representative Service GmbH submitted on 12 February 2019 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nilemdo, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 December 2017.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
The effect of Nilemdo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is  
composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based on 
applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) 
or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0185/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0185/2018 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary hypercholesterolemia by definition is any hypercholesterolemia which is caused by a 
disorder (either familial- or nonfamilial) in lipid metabolism and is not caused by another condition, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition (HeFH) is 
more rare and is estimated to occur between 1:200 and 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C levels in 
affected individuals are elevated, and in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still a 2-fold excess of 
CHD-related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this population. 
Hyperlipidemia is the heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excess of lipids (ie, 
cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides) in the bloodstream. Hypercholesterolemia specifically refers to 
the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to genetic 
causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle. Primary 
nonfamilial hyperlipidemia is hyperlipidemia that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, although 
there are polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidemia is generally defined as elevated LDL-C and high 
triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

CVD remains the leading cause of death among Americans, Europeans, and other populations around 
the world (World Health Organization [WHO], 2015).  Currently, over 93 million adults in the US have 
some form of CVD (Centers for Disease Control, 2018), which is responsible for one in every 4 deaths 
in the US (Centers for Disease Control, 2015). Across the European region, CVD causes more than half 
of all deaths (WHO, 2018).  CVD is a tremendous economic burden to society in both the US and 
Europe.  In Europe, CVD costs are €210 billion per year with approximately 53% due to health care 
costs, 26% associated with productivity losses, and 21% related to non-hospital related care 
(European Heart Network, 2017). 
CVD risk factors are well established and include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, 
diabetes, physical inactivity, obesity, and increasing age; the first 3 are the key risk factors.  Lowering 
cholesterol has been proven to reduce the risk of CVD.  In the most recent report by the WHO, the 
global prevalence of elevated TC in adults (≥ 5.0 mmol/l or 193 mg/dL) was 39%; the prevalence is 
higher in both Europe (54%) and the Americas (48%) (WHO, 2018).  Hypercholesterolemia that is a 
result of the genetic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), increases the risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) both in untreated and treated patients (Slack, 1969; Scientific 
Steering Committee, 1991; Kjaerggard et al, 2017). 
Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study indicated that 29% of global ischemic heart 
disease burden is attributable to high TC, the second leading risk factor after high blood pressure, 
which was responsible for 53% of global ischemic heart disease (Lim et al, 2012).  During 2005–2012, 
an estimated 37% of US adults met 2013 AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC) criteria for 
needing cholesterol lowering medication or were receiving cholesterol-lowering medication (Mercado et 
al, 2015).  A meta-analysis of over 30 studies evaluating diet, drugs, or surgery to lower LDL-C has 
shown that for every 1 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, total mortality is reduced by 1% (see Section 2.1.3.  
CVD related mortality in both the US and Europe has been decreasing (Benjamin et al, 2017; Wilkins 
et al, 2017).  Improvements in overall cardiovascular health are projected to reduce CHD deaths by 
30% between 2010 and 2020; although by 2030, there will still be 43.9% of the US population 
projected to have some form of CVD.  Several studies have attributed the declining heart disease 
mortality rates to improved risk factor control (44% to 58% of the decline) and medical and surgical 
therapies (23% to 47% of the decline) (Ford et al, 2007; Laatikainen et al, 2005; Unal et al, 2004).  
Cholesterol reduction was the leading contributor to the decline in CVD mortality in 2 of these studies 
(Laatikainen et al, 2005; Ford et al, 2007) and the second leading contributor in the third study (Unal 
et al, 2004).  An analysis estimated that of the 316,100 fewer deaths attributable to all risk factor 
declines (cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure), 79% were attributed to risk factor declines in 
asymptomatic individuals (primary prevention) and 21% were in patients with CHD (secondary 
prevention).  Cholesterol reduction accounted for the most significant proportion of CHD deaths 
prevented in primary prevention patients (Young et al, 2010).  These data emphasize the importance 
of targeting cholesterol reduction for both primary and secondary prevention of reducing CV events.  
This is supported by current US and EU recommendations that recognize LDL C goals are not always 
achievable with statin therapy alone and thus there remains an unmet medical need to provide 
additional LDL-C lowering therapies for patients with elevated LDL-C who are receiving maximally 
tolerated statin therapy (which may mean no statin at all) (Grundy et al, 2018; Catapano et al, 2016).  
Collectively, these data suggest that if the prevalence of elevated LDL-C was more widely reduced, this 
would lead to even greater declines in ASCVD-associated morbidity and mortality.

2.1.3.  Biologic features. Aetiology and pathogenesis. 
LDL-C as a surrogate for CVD 
Bempedoic acid is seeking marketing approval for an LDL-C lowering indication.  Lowering LDL-C has 
been accepted as a surrogate endpoint for the reduction of CV events by clinicians and regulatory 
authorities for many years (Cannon et al, 2002; Jacobson et al, 2014; Ference et al, 2017a).  To date, 
all cholesterol lipid-lowering drug approvals in the US and EU have been initially based on LDL C 
lowering without confirmed CV outcomes benefits.  Initial approvals of PCSK9 inhibitors, based on an 
LDL-C lowering mechanism through the LDL receptor and validation by human genetics, are the most 
recent evidence of the continued acceptance of LDL C lowering as a validated surrogate (Repatha 
[evolocumab] US Prescribing Information, 2017; Repatha SmPC 2018; Silverman et al, 2016; Ference 
et al, 2016).   
In 2017, the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) released a consensus statement to confirm the 
“LDL-C hypothesis” by stating that “there is a dose-dependent, log-linear association between absolute 
LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, and this association is independent of other cardiovascular risk 
factors and is consistent across the multiple lines of evidence" (Ference et al, 2017a).  Guidelines for 
LDL-C generally consider LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) as optimal for adults (Jellinger, et al, 
2017; Grundy et al, 2018).  In specific risk populations, the threshold of initiating or intensifying 
treatment is at LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) (Jellinger et al, 2017; Catapano et al, 2016; 
Stone et al, 2014; Grundy et al, 2018).  Across the bempedoic acid Phase 3 clinical program, mean % 
change in LDL-C was the primary efficacy endpoint.  All Phase 3 study eligibility criteria included 
patients having hyperlipidemia with at least LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on stable background 
lipid-modifying therapy (LMT). 
Evidence for the direct correlation between LDL-C and CVD comes from 4 different categories of 
studies: preclinical, epidemiological, genetics, and interventional (Feig, 2014; Williams et al, 2008; 
Zadelaar et al, 2007) (Taylor et al, 2002; Taylor et al, 2004; Tardif et al, 2006; Stamler et al, 1986; 
Kannel et al, 1971) (Chen et al, 1991).   
FH is a genetic condition that strongly supports the unique role of elevated LDL C in the risk of major 
CV events.  Patients with single gene (typically in the LDL receptor) mutations (heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) have untreated LDL C levels usually in the range of 200 to 500 mg/dL.  
HeFH increases the risk of ASCVD both in untreated and treated patients (Slack, 1969; Scientific 
Steering Committee, 1991; Kjaerggard et al, 2017).  Given the younger age of this at-risk population, 
patients with FH typically do not have an accumulation of the other traditional risk factors associated 
with CVD, such as hypertension, cigarette smoking, or diabetes typically seen in the general 
population, demonstrating the singular role that elevated LDL C can have in the progression of 
atherosclerosis and the development of premature major CV events.   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis 
Over 30 CVOTs in several LDL-C lowering drug therapies (including statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 
inhibitors) have validated LDL-C as a surrogate endpoint of CV events (Baigent et al, 2010; Cannon et 
al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2017; Silverman et al, 2016; Schwartz et al, 2018).  A patient-level meta-
analysis of statins including 26 large CVOTs and involving 170,000 participants showed a consistent 
relationship between LDL C reduction and CV outcomes.  This meta-analysis demonstrated that a 38.7 
mg/dL (1 mmol/L) lowering of LDL C was associated with a 22% reduction in the 5-year incidence of 
MACE, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic strokes (Baigent et al, 2010).  This large meta-
analysis has also demonstrated a consistency of the relationship between LDL-C lowering and reduction

secondary prevention, patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and across a wide range of 
baseline LDL-C levels.  Similar CV risk reductions have been reported for PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab 
and alirocumab (Sabatine et al, 2017; Schwartz et al, 2018).  There is no evidence for a threshold 
below which LDL C lowering is not beneficial.  Most recent CVOTs have achieved LDL-C levels of 35 to 
40 mg/dL, and recent trials have identified no apparent risk to achieving levels of LDL-C < 25 mg/dL 
(Boekholdt et al, 2014; Robinson et al, 2017). 
Results from some earlier CVOTs that have tested drug candidates in the cholesteryl ester transfer 
protein (CETP)-inhibitor class have suggested a potential lack of relationship between changes in LDL C 
with this class of drug and lack of CV benefit.  However, the most recent trial to complete in this class, 
REVEAL with anacetrapib, indicated a CV benefit that aligns with the absolute reduction in LDL C that 
was observed.  In the REVEAL study, there was an 11 mg/dL difference in LDL-C that translated to a 
CV event hazard ratio of 0.91 (p < 0.004) (Bowman et al, 2017).  These results further support the 
relationship between absolute reduction in LDL-C and reductions in major CV events as observed with 
statins.  The 3 previous trials testing CETP inhibitors likely suffered from extraneous issues that 
impeded or inhibited the ability to demonstrate this LDL-C/CV event relationship ranging from off-
target toxicity (torcetrapib; ILLUMINATE), lack of LDL C efficacy (dalcetrapib; dal-OUTCOMES), and a 
short patient follow-up period combined with a low baseline LDL C (evacetrapib; ACCELERATE).  When 
looking at the CETP-inhibitor data as a whole and understanding the basis for the results in these 
trials, the science still provides an overall supportive relationship to LDL C and CV events. 
A consistent role for lowering LDL-C to reduce the risk of major CV events has been established.  
Together, this evidence shows that lowering LDL-C with bempedoic acid meets the criteria as a valid 
surrogate endpoint for reducing CVD risk. 
Data to support the relationship between LDL-C and CV events and specifically the relationship with 
inhibition of ACL has been shown in genetic studies of variations in the genes that influence LDL-C 
(Mendelian randomization studies) and from studies in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia 
(FH), a genetic form of hyperlipidemia.  In Mendelian randomization studies evaluating multiple genetic 
targets that impact LDL-C levels, variants in genes that regulate LDL C levels (eg, HMG CoA reductase, 
LDL-R, PCSK9) have demonstrated lowering of LDL-C is associated with a lower risk for CV events 
(Kathiresan et al, 2008; Ference et al, 2016).  Several publications and reports summarize the findings 
from a portfolio of Mendelian randomization studies aimed to approximate the effect of ACL inhibition 
by bempedoic acid alone and in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies.  Similar to findings 
mediated by polymorphisms in HMG CoA reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and PCSK9, 
reductions in LDL-C mediated by polymorphisms in ACL were causally associated with a similar relative 
risk reduction in major vascular events per unit change in LDL C.  Furthermore, lower LDL-C and the 
associated CV risk mediated by polymorphisms in ACL were additive when combined with 
polymorphisms in HMG CoA reductase and NPC1L1.  These findings suggest that treatment with any 
combination of an ACL inhibitor, statins, ezetimibe, or a PCSK9 inhibitor should have therapeutically 
equivalent effects on the risk of CV events per unit reduction in LDL-C in all adult patients with 
hyperlipidemia (Ference et al, 2017b). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Available lipid lowering therapies include: 
• 
Statins (oral tablets), as a cornerstone therapy, for which CV benefits have extensively been 
proven across a wide range of patients with different CV risk profiles. 
The 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/EAS guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol focus 
on the benefits of statin therapy. Non-statin therapies, specifically ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 13/154 
 
 
 
(Catapano et al, 2016) could provide additional benefit or be used as alternative when patients are 
intolerant to statins or contra-indications to statins exist. 
• 
Ezetimibe (oral tablets), can be used as additional therapy when treatment goals have not 
been achieved with statins or when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. Cardiovascular benefits 
have been demonstrated in patients with ACS. 
• 
PCSK9 inhibitors (injectable biologics), can be used as additional therapy when treatment goals 
have not been achieved with statins or when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. 
Cardiovascular benefits have been demonstrated in patients with established cardiovascular disease. 
Despite the positive safety and high potency of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, these products are biologic 
injectable products with proven access issues (pricing and reimbursement) despite having broad 
labelling, including CV risk reduction, and are still not widely used even with a first line monotherapy 
indication for both CV risk reduction and LDL-C lowering (Baum et al, 2017; Cohen et al, 2017; Navar 
et al, 2017; Whayne, 2018).   
• 
Fibrates (oral tablets), omega-3 fatty acids (oral capsules), and bile acid sequestrants (oral 
tablets).  Cardiovascular benefits have not been demonstrated.   
Bile acid sequestrants and fibrates are generally less efficacious than statins at LDL C lowering, have 
recently demonstrated more neutral CV outcomes, and each have their own side effect profile that may 
limit their use, as is reflected in prescribing data (National Health Service, 2006).  Fibrates have been 
relegated to a minimal role in recent medical guidelines (Grundy et al, 2018; Catapano et al, 2016). 
For omega-3 fatty acids (oral capsules), cardiovascular benefits have not (anymore) been accepted 
based on recent CHMP decision. 
Results of a simulation model using data from a large US claims database showed that 31% of patients 
with ASCVD were unable to achieve an LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL with maximized statin therapy.  This only 
dropped to 14% when ezetimibe was added to the maximized statin therapy in this model (Cannon et 
al, 2017).  It is important to note that this model assumed maximal levels of patient compliance and 
adherence with the statin and ezetimibe and therefore represents the “best case scenario” for the 
treatment effect of these therapies.  Any issues of partial or total intolerance of these therapies would 
create a treatment gap greater than 14%.  The percentage of patients inadequately treated with statin 
therapy alone is even higher with real-world use.  A study of the US National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey 2011-2012 estimated that 70.7% of overall statin-eligible patients were on a 
statin and not at LDL-C goals; this included 79.7% of patients with ASCVD, 98% of patients with an 
LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, 42.3% of patients with diabetes and an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and 46.8% of 
patients with an estimated CV risk ≥ 7.5% and an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL (Wong et al, 2016). 
As many as 10% of patients are unable to tolerate statins at any dose due to dose-limiting toxicities 
and adverse effects that result in intolerance and/or contraindications (Thompson et al, 2016; 
Jacobson et al, 2014), and as many as 15% to 20% of all patients on statins may experience statin-
associated adverse events that may limit the dosage needed to reach LDL-C goals (Banach et al, 
2015).  All regions/countries recognize the importance of statin intolerance; however, 
regions/countries vary in their perspectives on defining “statin intolerance” and on prescription drug 
labelling using this terminology.  For example, in the EU statin intolerance language is included in label 
indications for LDL-C lowering drugs (Repatha SmPC, 2018).

Bempedoic acid (ETC-1002, CION-08 or ESP55016) is an oral small molecule low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering drug being developed for the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. 
Bempedoic acid is activated in the liver to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA), which 
subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-
3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Inhibition of 
cholesterol synthesis triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) 
expression in the liver resulting in increased clearance of LDL particles and lowering of LDL-C in the 
blood. Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in concomitant suppression of hepatic 
fatty acid biosynthesis. 
The applicant proposed the following indication: 
“Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are 
statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
The effect of Nilemdo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined.” 
The CHMP agreed to the following indication: 
Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4) 
or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are 
statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
The recommended dose of Nilemdo is one film-coated tablet of 180 mg taken once daily. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0185/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The PDCO issued a compliance report for the PIP, number EMA/769856/2018 on 14 December 2018, 
concluding the summited studies are compliant.  
The Applicant  received  European national scientific advice regarding bempedoic acid development in 
June 2015 with the following National Agencies:

A Scientific Advice meeting with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) was held in May 2016. 
This advice included, amongst other issues, an extensive discussion on the statin intolerance in which 
SAWP concluded that this should be defined as follows: patients not tolerating at least 2 different 
statins at the lowest approved daily dose, or to patients not tolerating at least 1 statin because of a 
severe safety effect that can be specifically attributed to statin use which precludes administration of a 
second statin. Patients tolerating statin doses below the approved dose range may be included. The 
proposed database size was supported. Other questions were related to the outcome trial. 
In a clarification letter (24 June 2016), the SAWP accepted the definition of statin intolerance as: the 
inability to tolerate at least 2 statins, one statin at the lowest daily dose (defined as rosuvastatin 5 mg, 
atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or 
pitavastatin 2 mg), AND another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms, other 
than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or 
increased during statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of bempedoic acid is 8-hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid 
corresponding to the molecular formula C19H36O5. It has a relative molecular mass of 344.49 g/mol and 
the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 16/154 
 
 
 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of bempedoic acid was elucidated by a combination of 1H- and 13C- NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS-MS), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and UV 
spectroscopy.  The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD), and single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). 
Bempedoic acid is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. There are no chiral centres in the molecule. 
Only one crystalline form of bempedoic acid has been identified. This form has been the only form used 
in all toxicology and clinical studies. The solubility of bempedoic acid is pH-dependent, with solubility 
increasing with increasing pH over the normal physiological pH range. It is insoluble at low pH values, 
and solubility increases rapidly above pH 6. Based on its low solubility and high permeability, 
bempedoic acid is a BCS Class II compound.  
Based on the review of the data provided by the applicant, it has been adequately substantiated that 
the active substance bempedoic acid contained in the medicinal product Nilemdo is considered to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bempedoic acid is synthesized using 3 well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
During the assessment some questions were devoted to the setting of the impurity specifications for 
the three starting materials. The overall control strategy for impurities from the starting materials is 
now adequate. The same is true for the control strategy for the GMP process, adequate understanding 
of the formation, fate and control of actual and theoretical impurities was demonstrated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on the chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Of 
the organic impurities, some have been detected in drug substance batches and are controlled in the 
drug substance in accordance with ICH Q3A (R2) “Impurities in New Drug Substances” (2006). 
Potential degradation products arising from the synthesis have been identified. However, they have not 
been detected in the batches manufactured. In addition, no degradation of the bempedoic acid drug 
substance has been observed in stability testing performed to date. 
In accordance with ICH M7, the compounds structure-based alert were evaluated for potential 
genotoxicity. These are controlled at 0.15% as per ICH Q3A(R2) as they were found not to be 
mutagenic following Ames testing. The active substance is tested for elemental impurities, lithium 
content and residue on ignition, at release to detect and quantify inorganic impurities. The results from 
all the batches manufactured to date are below the limits of quantitation / detection. 
The synthesis strategy for the bempedoic acid manufacturing process has remained unchanged 
throughout development and for commercialisation. The process has been optimized for efficiency and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020

process controls have been amended. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified.  
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene (PE) liners that are crimped closed and capped with a 
crimping system. The outer container (e.g., a PE or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum with a 
secure fitting lid or equivalent) is used as packaging to prevent damage to the primary container. The 
polyethylene liners comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies.  
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed NORs and PARs. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (FT-IR, HPLC-UV), assay 
(HPLC-UV), impurities (HPLC-CAD), acid acetic (IC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), 
elemental impurities (ICP), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur. 2.9.31 ), 
microbial content (Ph. Eur.2.6.12) and E. Coli (Ph. Eur. 2.6.13). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Forced degradation studies are described in S.7.1. HPLC CAD and HPLC UV analytical methods were 
used to evaluate the degradation products of the active substance following exposure to stressed 
conditions. Both methods are considered stability indicating. Organic impurities have been studied, and 
most of them are purged from the process. Identified and unidentified impurities are limited by the DS 
specification in line with ICH Q3A. 
No relevant degradation products from bempedoic acid have been detected. Potential genotoxic 
impurities have been adequately discussed. The specification requirements for elemental impurities, 
lithium, residue on ignition, and particle size have been sufficiently justified in S.4.5. (The PDE for 
lithium is 550 µg/day, so the proposed 500 ppm limit for lithium is suitable.) The arguments as 
provided for reduced testing (one batch per year) on microbial limit testing are acceptable. 
Analysis data from 12 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Additionally, supporting stability data from 10 batches, manufactured at 
different previous facilities ranging from pilot to commercial scale, for up to 60 months were provided. 
These batches were representative of the commercial process.  The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, assay, impurities, water content, and microbial examination. No significant changes were 
observed in the bempedoic acid primary stability samples stored after 18 months of long-term and 6

Page 18/154 
 
 
 
 
 
months of accelerated storage conditions. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the 
supporting active substance batches after 60 months. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Bempedoic acid 
samples were exposed to oxidative, basic, acidic, thermal, and light stress conditions. The active 
substance is stable under basic aqueous conditions and is photostable, but degrades under the other 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months at controlled 
room temperature of 20°C to 25°C in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Bempedoic acid has been developed for commercialization as white to off-white, oval, film-coated 180 
mg tablets, for oral administration. The tablets are debossed with ‘180’ on one side and ‘ESP’ on the 
other side. The tablet dimensions are 13.97mm x 6.60mm x 4.80mm (+/- 0.2mm). 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The initial risk assessment 
considered bempedoic acid drug substance physical and chemical properties that could impact the drug 
product critical quality attributes (CQA).  
The free dicarboxylic acid form was selected as the drug substance early in development as it is 
anhydrous, crystalline, and non-hygroscopic. Bempedoic acid was determined to be very stable and not 
affected by hydrolysis Bempedoic acid’s high solubility in the lower gastrointestinal tract and relatively 
high bioavailability ensure good drug absorption. Hence, based on its low solubility and high 
permeability, bempedoic acid is a BCS Class II compound. 
Bempedoic acid is to be marketed as 180 mg white, oval, film-coated, IR tablets for oral 
administration. As such, bempedoic acid tablets do not contain any excipients that are intended to 
modify the drug release rate or influence the mechanism of absorption in vivo. The excipients selected 
for the tablet formulation ensure manufacturability and allow for QD (quaque die, i.e. once a day) 
administration. While the solubility of the bempedoic acid drug substance is low (<1 mg/mL in water), 
the long half-life in the body, and a high potency allowed for development of an immediate release 
tablet formulation without the use of solubilizers.  
Bempedoic acid drug product is formulated using compendial excipients that have been demonstrated 
to be safe for oral administration. Film-coating is used to make the tablets easier to swallow and to 
ensure consistent colour. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. There are 
no overages used in the formulation of bempedoic acid tablets, 180 mg. 
A discriminatory and quality control dissolution method was developed at a physiologically relevant, 
intermediate pH to ensure adequate solubility and sink conditions.  The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method has been demonstrated being able to show difference in composition and 
manufacturing processes. 
Using compendial tablet excipients and a manufacturing process with well-defined process parameters 
resulted in successful scale-up to a commercial scale process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020

The process parameters that may influence drug product’s CQAs have been evaluated or have been 
fixed based on those used in clinical manufacture. Critical Process parameters (CPPs) were identified 
by risk assessment and subsequent experimentation and were either fixed or ranges were established 
that ensure the tablets meet acceptance criteria. 
The bempedoic acid formulation and manufacturing process development work has been further 
evaluated and found acceptable during the manufacture of Phase 3 clinical supplies.  
In accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q6A, “Specifications, Decision Tree 8 
(Microbiological Attributes of Non-Sterile Drug Products)” in “Specifications: Test Procedures and 
Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances” (1999), a 
non-routine microbiological testing plan is proposed to monitor the drug product. The reduced testing 
plan is based on microbiological controls in place for the ingoing materials, environmental controls, and 
extensive batch data. 
The blister components that comprise the commercial container closure systems were selected for 
bempedoic acid tablets because these are commonly used primary packaging components for the 
storage and transportation of solid oral dosage forms. 
The primary packaging is polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/aluminum blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  6  main  steps.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard 
manufacturing process. 
Validation of the finished product manufacturing process will be conducted prospectively on 3 production 
scale  batches  at  the  typical  production  scale.  The  critical  process  parameters  for  the  manufacturing 
process,  evaluated  during  validation,  confirm  they  are  adequate  for  consistently  producing  a  product 
that  meets  the  regulatory  specification.  The  study  was  conducted  according  to  approved  validation 
protocols. Process validation and the final report will be completed before commercial drug product is 
released to the market.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  consist  of  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including  appearance,  dimensions,  identity  (HPLC-UV),  potency  (HPLC-UV),  purity  (HPLC-CAD), 
dissolution (, HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbial limits (Ph. 
Eur. 2.6.12 and 2.6.13). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Elemental contributions 
from excipients and drug substance were evaluated using Option 2b, and the results demonstrate that 
all Class 1 and 2A elemental impurities are controlled to below the 30% PDE threshold. The information 
on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay (potency) and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 15 batches of the commercial formulation confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 primary commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  related  substances,  dissolution,  water  content,  and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes to 
any to the above tested parameters were observed. No new degradation products were detected. The 
data show little to no change over time with little to no variability. In addition, no significant changes 
were observed in the supporting finished product batches after 24 months. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results of photostability studies indicate that the product is not 
light sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months without any special temperature 
storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal

Post approval change management protocol 
A Post approval change management protocol has been proposed for the manufacture of the drug 
substance bempedoic acid to support the addition of alternate suppliers for the designated regulatory 
starting materials (RSMs) used in the manufacture of bempedoic acid drug substance.  This protocol is 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress 
and to investigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine in their medicinal products, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in (name active substance + finished product) is conducted within six months of the 
marketing authorisation. In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a 
result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately 
validated and sensitive methods within a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier 
time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk 
mitigation steps should be implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Bempedoic acid is a novel orally active small molecule with a molecular weight of 344.5 Da that upon 
activation by very long chain acyl-Coenzyme A synthetase 1 (ACSLV1) into bempedoyl-CoA (ETC-
1002-CoA) functions as a competitive inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL). ACL is an 
enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) and of acyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC) in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. ACL converts citrate into acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-
CoA), which then is formed into HMG-CoA by ACC. Subsequently, this HMG-CoA is converted into 
mevalonic acid by HMG-CoA reductase. Selective inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, such as statins, 
decrease sterol (cholesterol) synthesis, while inhibitors of ACC reduce fatty acid synthesis and 
catabolism. An inhibition of ACL may, therefore, inhibit both cholesterol as fatty acid synthesis. 
Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis has been shown to result in an upregulation of hepatic LDL-R protein 
expression and increased the clearance of LDL-C by LDL-R from plasma.

The Applicant demonstrated, using radiolabeled substrates, such as [14C]acetate, [3H]H2O, 
[14C]pyruvate, and [14C]glucose, as metabolic precursors, that bempedoic acid inhibited de novo sterol 
and fatty acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures and livers of treated rats. The [14C]acetate 
incorporation into fatty acids and sterol fractions were reduced with an IC50 of 8.5 μM and 3 μM, 
respectively. Inhibition of lipid synthesis was also demonstrated in primary human liver cells, where 
bempedoic acid blocked both fatty acid and sterol synthesis using labelled precursors. In addition, in 
both primary human hepatocytes and rat hepatoma cells, bempedoic acid increased sterol response 
element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) gene transcription, LDL-R expression and LDL-R related uptake, 
which was also found with statin treatment. 
To determine the enzyme in the lipid synthesis pathway targeted by bempedoic acid, a quantitative 
assessment of multiple metabolic intermediates of lipid synthesis was conducted and bempedoic acid 
was found to reduce several metabolites including the product of ACL, acetyl-CoA, while transient 
increases in its substrate, citrate, were observed suggesting that bempedoic acid inhibited the lipid 
synthesis pathway at the point of ACL.  
Enzyme kinetic analyses in a cell free recombinant human ACL enzyme assay, however, demonstrated 
that not bempedoic acid but bempedoyl-CoA inhibited the ACL enzyme and that bempedoyl--CoA acted 
as a competitive inhibitor of ACL for CoA competition (Ki = 2 μM) and not on ATP competition. The 
formation of CoA ester of bempedoic acid was shown to occur primary in rat hepatocyte s incubated 
with bempedoic acid (up to 100 μM).  
With respect to the other rate limiting enzymes within in the lipid biosynthetic pathway, neither 
bempedoic acid nor bempedoic acid-CoA inhibited HMG-CoA reductase, and that bempedoic acid did 
not inhibit ACC, while bempedoyl-CoA demonstrated a weak inhibition of ACC with an IC50 at 29 ± 5 
μM.  In line with the absence of inhibition of sterol synthesis downstream of HMG-CoA reductase, 
bempedoic acid did not inhibit [14C]mevalonolactone incorporation in primary rat hepatocytes, which is 
consistent with an inhibition of sterol synthesis at the point of ACL and/or ACC. 
Using selective inhibitors, ACSVL1 was found to be the specific acylCoA synthetase (ACS) isoform that 
catalyzes the CoA activation of bempedoic acid. In primary human liver microsomes (n=8) a mean 
activity of 784.8 ± 124 pmol/mg/min was found. In addition, gene silencing of ACSVL1, using siRNA, 
strongly reduced bempedoic acid-CoA formation and the effect of bempedoic acid on de novo lipid 
synthesis in McArdle (rat hepatoma) cells.  
Primary pharmacodynamics: in vivo 
The effects of bempedoic acid on lipid synthesis was studied in the diet-induced, and cholestyramine 
fed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models of enhanced lipogenesis. The 14C-acetate incorporation in lipids 
(sterol and fatty acid) in serum and liver was dose-dependently reduced by bempedoic acid (3 - 
100 mg/kg, po). Such an inhibition of lipid synthesis was not found in a (fasted) model with non-
enhanced lipid synthesis. In high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC)-fed male golden Syrian hamsters, 
bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day, po QD, 3 wks) induced a reduction in LDL-C and VLDL-C, triglycerides 
and cholesterol, while HDL-C levels remained unchanged.  
Bempedoic acid was also administered daily to normal chow-fed male SD rats (2 weeks) and Golden 
Syrian Hamsters (3 weeks) to assess the effects on normal, non-enhanced, lipid metabolism. The 
initial changes (Week 1), such as a decrease in VLDL-C and triglyceride, were no longer observed after 
2 weeks due to a metabolic compensatory “rebound” response. In hamsters, an increase in HDL-C 
levels without an effect on non-HDL-C levels was found.  
The obese Zucker Fatty rat has a mutation in the leptin receptor that induces hypertriglyceridemia with 
increased VLDL-C and decreased HDL-C levels. Bempedoic acid dose-dependently increased HDL-C and 
Assessment report

Page 23/154 
 
 
 
β-HBA and decreased non-HDL-C, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids, indicative of decreased 
de novo synthesis of fatty acids and increased metabolic utilization of triglycerides. 
In the apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mouse, a model of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in 
mice, bempedoic acid treatment (30 mg/kg, PO, daily for 14 days) decreased LDL by 61% and 
increased HDL (+300%) and VLDL (+23%), while total cholesterol did not change. The cholesteryl 
ester content in vascular tissues was not significantly changed. After long-term bempedoic acid 
treatment (30 mg/kg, PO, daily for 12 weeks) to ApoE mice, only LDL was reduced (38%), while no 
HDL or VLDL or total cholesterol change was seen. In addition to a reduction in plasma liver cholesterol 
(-28%) and liver triglycerides (-74%), a 2-fold upregulation of LDL-R in the liver was seen with 
bempedoic acid treatment. Whole aorta cholesterol content and vascular atherosclerotic lesion size, 
which were increased 2.5-fold and 7-fold, respectively, were attenuated 38% and 21%, respectively, 
by bempedoic acid treatment. In the ApoE & AMPKβ1 Double Knock-Out (DKO) mice similar lipid and 
LDL-R responses were seen with bempedoic acid treatment as found in the ApoE KO mouse although 
no liver AMPK activity was detected, suggesting independence of AMPK pathway.  
In both LDLR+/- and LDLR-/- Yucatan miniature pigs fed an HFHC diet, plasma cholesterol and LDL-C 
increased over 160 days. Bempedoic acid treatment (120 or 240 mg/day, orally) reduced LDL-C 
leading to a ~50% and ~30% reduction in LDLR+/- and LDLR-/-, respectively, as compared to placebo 
after 160 days of treatment. No consistent effects of bempedoic acid were observed on HDL-C, VLDL, 
liver lipids or triglycerides. Bempedoic acid treatment decreased aortic and abdominal lesion size in 
these minipigs with about 50% as compared to placebo. 
Primary pharmacodynamics: Metabolites 
ESP15228 (M1) is the 8-keto metabolite of bempedoic acid and is in humans a major metabolite. 
Therefore, also the pharmacological properties of this metabolite on lipid synthesis were analysed. 
ESP15228 inhibited the synthesis of both sterols and fatty acids in the primary rat hepatocyte model 
with an IC50 for both pathways of less than 3 μM, similar to bempedoic acid. In contrast to bempedoic 
acid or ESP15228, the glucuronides of bempedoic acid (M11) and of ESP15228 (M15) did not inhibit 
lipid synthesis in vitro at 100 μM in primary mouse hepatocytes, which corresponds to 7- and 50-times 
the circulating human Cmax. 
In vivo in cholestyramine-primed rats, ESP15228 displayed reduced hepatic fatty acid and sterol 
synthesis in the liver and in the obese Zucker Fatty rat model, similar effects were found with 
ESP15228 as with bempedoic acid. ESP15228, however, did not inhibit ACC activity nor did ESP15228 
activate the AMPK pathway. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Bempedoic acid had no significant effect (IC50 <100 μM) in an in vitro binding screen using a broad 
panel of isolated human receptors, ion channels, transporters, and enzymes. 
It was shown that ACSVL1 is not expressed in microsomes preparations from human skeletal muscle, 
or in primary human myotubes or L6 myotubes, while ACSVL1 expression was highest in liver 
microsomes and expression in human kidney microsomes was only 10% of that observed in liver. 
Consistent with the lack of ACSVL1 expression in skeletal muscle, bempedoic acid-CoA was not formed 
in these tissues, and bempedoic acid did not suppress sterol synthesis or promote cytotoxicity in rat 
and human myotube cultures. In addition, no signs of muscle-related toxicological effects were seen in 
rat, mouse or monkey upon long-term dosing. The muscle-related complaints found with statins, 
myalgia, may be related to its effect in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (mevalonate depletion leading 
to subsequent myotoxicity). Bempedoic acid, however, does not seem to impact cholesterol synthesis 
in muscle.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 24/154 
 
 
 
Another difference with statins is its inhibitory effects on fatty acid biosynthesis. The coordination 
between fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation occurs at the level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. ACC produces malonyl-CoA which is a potent 
allosteric inhibitor of the mitochondrial long chain fatty acid transporter protein carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I). In vitro studies with primary rat hepatocytes using a cofactor for CPT-I 
activity and a CPT-I  inhibitor suggest that the suppression of fatty acid synthesis by bempedoic acid 
activates CPT-I-dependent import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for subsequent 
β-oxidation and that bempedoic acid does not adversely affect intra-mitochondrial oxidation pathways. 
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that treatment with bempedoic acid coincided with increases in 
AMPKα phosphorylation, a marker of AMPK activation, which was found to be due to a direct, allosteric, 
interaction of bempedoic acid-CoA but not bempedoic acid with AMPK complexes in a β1-dependent 
manner. The contribution of AMPK activation to the pharmacodynamic effect of bempedoic acid in 
humans, if any, is expected to be low as the liver predominately expresses not β1, but AMPK 
β2-containing complexes and ACSVL1 are mainly expressed in the liver.   
In human monocyte-derived macrophages, bempedoic acid partially blocked the LPS-induced 
decreases in AMPK phosphorylation, which coincided with decreased production of some 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In vivo, bempedoic acid attenuates homing of leukocytes 
into inflammatory sites and inhibits adipose tissue inflammation in a mouse model of diet-induced 
obesity but whether these specific effects are observed in humans remains to be demonstrated. 
Given the low binding affinity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation was not 
considered a viable molecular target responsible for the effects of bempedoic acid on the lipid 
biosynthesis pathway. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics: In vivo 
In mice, daily bempedoic acid treatment (30 mg/kg/day, po, QD) for seven days slightly increased 
faecal neutral cholesterol excretion and increased gallbladder biliary cholesterol compared to vehicle, 
without affecting gallbladder biliary phospholipid content. Bempedoic acid did not affect fractional 
cholesterol absorption, while ezetimibe (10 mg/kg/day, po, QD) completely blocked cholesterol 
absorption.  
LDL-R deficient mice maintained on high cholesterol containing diets develop hyperlipidemia, hepatic 
steatosis, and atherosclerosis. Treatment with bempedoic acid (po, QD, 10 - 100 mg/kg) for 12 or 16 
weeks induced strong reductions in diet-enhanced serum lipids, had profound reductions in aortic lipid 
content and dose-dependently reduced atherosclerotic lesions and an attenuation of the diet-induced 
inflammatory response in liver, plasma and aorta.  
The effects of bempedoic acid on triglycerides, glycemic control (glucose, insulin) and body weight 
were investigated in the hypertriglyceridemic obese KKAy mouse model of insulin resistance, diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice, male golden Syrian hamsters, on a fructose diet to induce hyperglycemia. 
In these rodent models, bempedoic acid was found to reduce triglycerides, and partly improve 
glycemic control. However, given that these effects seem to be dependent on diet and bempedoic acid 
most of the times reduced body weight gain, the relevance of these effect for humans is unclear. 
Following 12 weeks of daily oral dosing in KKAy mice, which are hypertriglyceridemic, spontaneously 
obese and insulin resistant, bempedoic acid (10 & 60 mg/kg) reduces circulating and hepatic 
triglycerides and partly improved glucose tolerance. The combined effects observed in the KKAy mouse 
model suggests bempedoic acid acts as a metabolic regulator of lipid and carbohydrate imbalances. 
DIO mice develop obesity, hyperinsulinemia, mild hyperglycemia, impaired insulin sensitivity, impaired 
glucose tolerance, and elevated hepatic triglycerides in response to the high (60%) fat diet. Treatment

of these mice with bempedoic acid for 9 weeks, dose-dependently attenuated body weight gain and 
resulted in reductions in hepatic (46%) and plasma (26%) triglyceride content, fasting glucose (16%), 
and fasting insulin (92%). Reductions in HOMA-IR suggest reduced insulin resistance, while increases 
in QUICKI scores and reductions in insulin tolerance test glucose indicate improved insulin 
sensitization. Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated that DIO mice had impaired glucose tolerance 
relative to the lean diet fed mice. Bempedoic acid, however, had no impact on glucose tolerance in this 
study.  
In male golden Syrian hamsters, on a 60% fructose diet to induce hyperglycemia (acute insulin 
resistance marked by impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity), bempedoic acid treatment 
resulted in improved postprandial glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and improved insulin sensitivity 
unrelated to fasting glucose or insulin levels. Bempedoic acid treatment reduced body weight gain and 
produced reductions in hepatic and plasma triglycerides although no changes in plasma total 
cholesterol or ApoB were observed.  
Finally, the effects of bempedoic acid on elevated blood pressure was investigated in female 
spontaneously hypertensive obese (SHROB) Koletsky rats but given that the SHROB rat model is a 
hyperphagic obesity driven model of hypertension, and that bempedoic acid was associated with 
reduced food consumption, it was not possible to determine whether the anti-hypertensive effects or 
improvements in other outcomes observed in this study were directly and/or indirectly related to 
bempedoic acid treatment.   
Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies, bempedoic acid administration was not associated with adverse effects 
on CNS, pulmonary, or cardiovascular function.  
Bempedoic acid had no significant effects on the inhibition of the hERG current at concentrations up to 
300 μM, while a slight increase (5.4%) was found at 1000 μM (345 μg/mL), which is at 575 times the 
anticipated Cmax of unbound bempedoic acid (0.6 μg/mL) at the proposed human dose of 180 mg. 
Therefore, no hERG-related effects on QT interval would be expected in humans. Furthermore, up to 
100 mg/kg given orally to male monkeys, bempedoic acid did not produce any significant change in 
cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial), or 
ECG parameters (QRS duration, or PR, RR, or QT intervals). Thus, bempedoic acid did not affect 
cardiovascular function in monkeys. 
Bempedoic acid did not have any physiologically significant acute or residual effects on 
arousal/activity, autonomic, neuromuscular, or physiological functions but significant decreases in 
thermal response were observed in the rat at 100 mg/kg 4 and 24 hours postdose. 
There were no bempedoic acid related changes in any respiratory function parameters (respiratory 
rate, tidal volume, minute volume) in rats given single oral doses up to 100 mg/kg. Thus, bempedoic 
acid did not affect pulmonary function. 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies have been performed concerning the potential effects of 
bempedoic acid to affect renal function/urinary parameters, but this is evaluated in the general toxicity 
studies (rat/monkey). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No apparent and consistent pharmacodynamic interactions with respect to LDL-C lowering in LDL-R 
deficient mice was observed when 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid was given for 2 weeks 
Assessment report

alone or in combination with atorvastatin at 10 or 30 mg/kg/day as the LDL baseline levels and 
changes were highly variable, not consistent over the different doses, and troubled by rebound effects 
on lipogenesis. 
In conclusion, bempedoic acid acts as a prodrug that requires activation by ACSLV1 to form 
bempedoic acid-CoA, which mediates competitive inhibition of ACL. Inhibition of ACL decreases 
cholesterol synthesis in the liver leading to increased SREBP2 and LDL-R expression and LDL clearance 
from the blood. Inhibition of ACL by bempedoic acid-CoA decreases LDL-C via the same pathway as 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by statins but at an upstream enzyme step. In addition, unlike statins, 
an inhibition of liver fatty acid biosynthesis and a reduction in triglycerides was seen.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK profile of bempedoic acid was investigated following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic acid 
to rats, rabbits and monkeys. Toxicokinetic studies were performed in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
Methods of analysis 
Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228 were analysed in the serum of mice, rats, rabbits 
and monkeys using validated LC-MS/MS methods. Regarding selectivity, carry-over, calibration, 
accuracy, precision, dilution integrity, matrix effect and stability, the methods were sufficiently 
validated. Validated LC-MS/MS methods were also used for the measurement of ezetimibe and 
ezetimibe glucuronide in the serum of rats and atorvastatin, and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and 4-
hydroxyatorvastatin in serum of monkeys in combination studies. In distribution studies in rats, 
radioactivity in tissues was analysed by whole-body autoradiography (single dose studies) or liquid 
scintillation counting (repeated dose study). Metabolite profiling in plasma, urine, bile (rats only), liver 
and feces of rats and monkeys and in plasma of rabbits was performed by HPLC. The metabolites were 
identified using LC-MS/MS on all peaks accounting for > 2% of sample radioactivity. Radioactivity in 
excreta was analysed using liquid scintillation counting. 
Absorption 
Bempedoic acid was highly permeable through Caco-2 cell monolayers. The efflux ratio of 0.7 indicates 
that bempedoic acid permeates Caco-2 cell monolayers primarily by a passive mechanism. 
In repeated dose studies in mice, exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally. Exposure 
decreased with time.  
In rats, Tmax was 8 h, and elimination half-life was 27 h after oral administration of a single dose of 
100 mg/kg bempedoic acid.  After administration of 10 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid, Tmax of 
radioactivity was 2 h, and elimination half-life was 18 h, suggesting delayed absorption at the higher 
dose. The volume of distribution of bempedoic acid was 123 mL/kg, indicating that it was not 
distributed beyond the extracellular fluid in rats. Comparison of intact and bile duct-cannulated rats 
showed the occurrence of enterohepatic recirculation (contributing approximately 39% to the total 
AUC). No study with IV administration was performed, and therefore, oral bioavailability could not be 
calculated. However, the mass balance study demonstrated that bioavailability was at least 90% in 
rats. In repeated dose studies in rats, concentrations of bempedoic acid and ESP15228 increased more 
than dose-proportionally up to 100 mg/kg/day, while it increased less than dose-proportionally at 
higher doses, suggesting saturation of the absorption mechanism at the higher doses. Exposure 
decreased with time, except in pregnant rats, where this effect was less. In juvenile rats, Cmax at 10 
mg/kg/day was comparable to adult rats. AUC0-24h on day 1 in juvenile rats was slightly higher than 
in adult rats; afterwards, it was comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 27/154 
 
 
 
After oral administration of 20 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid to rabbits, Tmax was 4 hours. The 
elimination half-life of radioactivity was 10-13 h. In pregnant rabbits, exposure increased in time from 
gestation day 6 to 18. Accumulation ratio was ≤ 2 for bempedoic acid and 2.6-4.0 for ESP15228 
(based on AUC0-24h).   
After oral administration of 10 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid to cynomolgus monkeys, Tmax was 1 
hour. The elimination half-life of total radioactivity from plasma was 18 h. No evidence of 
enterohepatic recirculation was found. No study with IV administration was performed, and therefore, 
oral bioavailability could not be calculated. From the mass balance study, it can only be concluded that 
the bioavailability was at least 49%. In repeated dose studies in monkeys, AUC of bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228 increased more than dose-proportionally at doses from 10 to 60 mg/kg/day and 
approximately dose-proportionally from 50 to 500 mg/kg/day. Cmax increased approximately dose-
proportionally in monkeys. Exposure increased in time. Accumulation ratio in monkeys was 2.0-2.4 for 
bempedoic acid and 2.0-2.9 for ESP15228. 
No consistent gender effects were observed in mice and monkeys. In rats, no gender effect was 
observed in the exposure to bempedoic acid. Exposure to ESP15228 was slightly lower in females than 
in males in adult rats, but not in juvenile rats.  
Food effect was not studied in the non-clinical studies. 
Distribution 
Protein binding of bempedoic acid was high and similar between species (mouse, rat, monkey and 
human) up to 100 µg/mL (94-97%). ESP15228 and bempedoic acid glucuronide were also highly 
protein bound in human plasma (99%). Radioactivity was quickly distributed in tissues of rats with 
maximal tissue concentrations at 2 h post-dose. For most tissues, except liver and kidney, the tissue-
blood (T/B) ratio was found to be <1. The highest concentrations were found in liver, kidney and lung 
and contents of the GI tract. The liver is the main target organ of toxicity in rats (see section 4.2). 
There was no retention in melanin-containing tissue. At 168 h after administration, only low 
concentrations were found in liver, kidney and the GI tract. After 14 days dosing with 10 mg/kg/day, 
maximal concentration in the liver was approximately 2-fold higher compared to a single dose, while 
concentrations in kidney, skeletal muscle and whole blood were comparable to those after single 
dosing. Bempedoic acid-related radioactivity did not preferentially partition into red blood cells of rats, 
rabbits and monkeys. Placental transfer and excretion in milk have not been studied. 
Metabolism 
In hepatocytes of the mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, the largest metabolite found was 
bempedoic acid glucuronide conjugate and to a lesser extent ESP15228-glucuronide conjugate. In 
addition, 11 minor metabolites were found. A study in human hepatic microsomes showed that P450 
enzymes are not involved in the metabolism of bempedoic acid and ESP15228. In human hepatic 
microsomes, UGT2B7 was identified as the enzyme responsible for the glucuronidation of bempedoic 
acid and ESP15228. Some induction of CYP2C8 activity by bempedoic acid was found at 300 µM in 
human hepatocytes of 3 donors. An increase in CYP2C8 mRNA content was found in 1 donor. At 300 
µM, also some induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 was observed, but to a lower extent than 
CYP2C8 and with no increase in mRNA content. Since 300 µM corresponds to approximately 5x the 
human Cmax at a dose of 180 mg/day, and no significant induction was observed at 30 µM, these 
effects are not expected to be clinically significant. In human hepatic microsomes, no significant 
inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 by 
bempedoic acid was observed. UGT1A1 was inhibited by bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid 
glucuronide by ≥50%. UGT1A3 was inhibited by bempedoic acid by approximately 50%. Because the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 28/154 
 
 
 
study was performed using concentrations of 10x human Cmax, the potential for UGT inhibition at 
clinically relevant concentrations is expected to be low. 
The parent compound bempedoic acid was the major component in plasma of rats, rabbits and 
monkeys. The most important metabolic pathway is conjugation, mainly with glucuronide but also (to a 
minor extent) with glutathione, taurine and glycerol. A minor pathway found in all investigated species 
was the formation of the keto-metabolite ESP15228. In rats, a relevant pathway was the formation of 
hydroxylated or acid metabolites of which the most important (rats) was M2, mono-hydroxymethyl 
bempedoic acid. In monkey, also a glucuronide of ESP15228 was formed (M15), while M2 could not be 
found in the plasma of monkeys. Metabolism in monkeys corresponded well to metabolism in humans, 
with the parent compound comprising the major part of radioactivity in plasma and the formation of 
ESP15228, bempedoic acid glucuronide (M11) and ESP15228 glucuronide (M15), though, in humans, 
larger parts are converted into M11 and M15 than in monkeys. Metabolism in rats corresponded less 
well to human metabolism since M11 and M15 were not found in the plasma of rats and ESP15228 in 
lower amounts than in humans and monkeys. There are no unique major human metabolites. 
However, M15 was found only in low amounts in the plasma of monkeys (1.8-2.7% of sample 
radioactivity between 4 and 24 h after dosing) and it was not found in rats. This is not expected to be 
a problem for safety though, because M15 is the glucuronide conjugate of ESP15228, which was 
formed in sufficient amounts in monkeys and can be considered sufficiently investigated, and the 
glucuronide of ESP15228 is not expected to be more toxic than ESP15228. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic acid to rats, excretion of total radioactivity occurred 
primarily via the bile (86% of the dose) and to a lesser extent via urine (17% of the dose). The rat 
data show that bempedoic acid was well-absorbed in rats (oral bioavailability was at least 90%). Total 
recovery was high in rats (97% after 120 h in intact rats and 93% after 48 h in bile duct-cannulated 
rats) and slightly lower in monkeys (86% after 120 h). Following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic 
acid to cynomolgus monkeys, excretion occurred for a larger part in urine (49% of the dose) than in 
feces (29% of the dose) at 120 h post-dose. Regarding oral bioavailability in monkeys, it can only be 
concluded that it was at least 49%. Excretion in humans occurred primarily via urine (~70% of the 
dose), and therefore, in this respect, the monkey is a more clinically relevant animal model than the 
rat. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
A combination of bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day) and ezetimibe (750 mg/kg/day in male rats, 250 
mg/kg/day in non-pregnant female rats and 183-720 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats) had no effect on the 
exposure to bempedoic acid and ESP15228 in rats (males and non-pregnant females as well as 
pregnant rats), compared to administration of bempedoic acid alone. Effects of the combination on 
ezetimibe exposure were not consistent, most likely due to extensive enterohepatic cycling of 
ezetimibe/ezetimibe glucuronide. When ezetimibe was combined with 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, 
exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide increased at least 2 times. In combination with 10 
mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, only a slight increase in exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide 
(approximately 10-30%) was observed. The exposures to bempedoic acid, ESP15228, atorvastatin and 
2-hydroxyatorvastatin in cynomolgus monkeys were not significantly affected by the combination 
compared to when bempedoic acid (20 mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) were administered 
alone.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Bempedoic acid showed low oral acute toxic potential in rats and monkeys. The oral LD50 was > 1000 
mg/kg in rats and >2000 mg/kg in monkeys. 
In rats, body weight gain was decreased in males 14 days after dosing. In monkeys, body weight loss 
and emesis were observed in both sexes, but without a clear dose-relation. Food consumption was 
decreased at ≥500 mg/kg. Slight increases in liver and kidney related parameters and decreases in 
glucose were noted in both species. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In mice, treatment with bempedoic acid by oral gavage was associated with decreased plasma glucose 
levels (starting at 300 mg/kg) and adverse effects on the liver (hepatocellular degeneration; 
hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration; diffuse vacuolation; increased Kupffer cell pigment and 
centrilobular to panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy at all doses, and increased ALP, AST and ALT 
levels and individual hepatocyte necrosis at doses ≥300 mg/kg/day). In addition, testes and seminal 
vesicle weight were decreased, associated with seminiferous tubule degeneration/atrophy. At the 
highest dose (1000 mg/kg), 3 females were found dead or were euthanatized in extremis due to poor 
condition and clinical signs. At this dose, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were also 
decreased. 
Bempedoic acid-induced liver toxicity in rats, shown by increased liver enzymes (ALP, GGT, ALT, AST), 
accompanied by increased liver weight and microscopic findings (centrilobular to panlobular 
hepatocellular hypertrophy, individual hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocellular vacuolation, bile duct 
hyperplasia). The microscopic effects in the liver were not completely reversed after 4 weeks recovery. 
According to the applicant, hepatocellular hypertrophy without further microscopic hepatic changes 
such as necrosis is not considered adverse. However, there is a clear dose-relationship in all studies, 
with hepatocellular hypertrophy as the first sign of liver damage, which progresses at increasing doses. 
Therefore, according to the assessor, hypertrophy should be considered as the first sign of adverse 
liver damage. 
Reduced erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and haematocrit were also observed in rats, as well as increased 
numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. In addition, decreases in prothrombin time 
(PT) and in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were observed.  
High dose levels induced clinical signs, as moribundity, impaired limb function, hunched posture, thin 
appearance, decreased activity, ataxia, tonic convulsions, prostration, skin cold to the touch, lateral 
recumbency, and abnormal breathing. 
Furthermore, bempedoic acid treatment in rats resulted in decreased body weight and increased 
glucose, calcium, and cholesterol levels. Only at the highest dose in the 6-month study, a decrease in 
glucose levels was observed. Considering the pharmacologic effect of bempedoic acid, an increase in 
cholesterol is unexpected. However, this can be explained by a metabolic compensatory response at 
low doses (see 2.1.2). 
Kidney effects (increased creatinine and increased incidence and severity of the renal tubular 
dilatation) were observed in the 3-month study, but not in the 1- and 6-month studies. An enlarged 
spleen, accompanied by extramedullary hematopoiesis was only observed in the 1 month study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 30/154 
 
 
 
In the monkey, decreased body weight, reduced circulating red cell mass, prolonged APTT and PT were 
observed. The effects on the liver were less prominent in the monkey compared to adverse liver effects 
in rodents and were restricted to increased liver weight, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and 
periportal hepatocellular vacuolation. This can be explained by the fact that bempedoic acid 
metabolism in rodents occurs predominantly via the liver, whereas in monkeys, it is shifted more 
towards the kidney. It is noted that, concerning metabolism, the monkey more closely resembles the 
human than the rodent, and therefore, liver effects observed in monkey are more relevant for humans.  
Increased creatinine levels were observed in all pivotal monkey studies, however, no related 
microscopic changes were observed in the kidney. 
In the 3-month study, morphological changes were observed in the bone marrow that were indicative 
of early myelofibrosis and cytotoxicity. 
In all species, overall, adverse effects seemed to be slightly more pronounced in females. 
Combination studies with bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in rats up to 3 months resulted in similar 
effects and with similar magnitude as bempedoic acid alone. 
Combined administration of bempedoic acid and atorvastatin in monkeys resulted in mortality at dose 
levels where either of the products alone did not result in severe toxic effects. The combination 
resulted in an exaggeration of effects observed with atorvastatin alone and included gastrointestinal 
effects (red/watery feces, hemorrhage/inflammation in large intestine) and findings consistent with 
inflammation (increased neutrophils and/or monocytes and fibrinogen), correlating with bone marrow 
granulocytic hyperplasia at high doses. Depletion of splenic red pulp was also observed. 
Hepatic toxicity, including an increase in liver enzymes, panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, 
centrilobular hepatocellular vacuolation and necrosis were also observed in the animals receiving 
combination treatment.  
The results indicate that atorvastatin in combination with bempedoic acid can result in excessive 
toxicity. However, according to the applicant, no adverse effects were observed at a combination of 20 
mg/kg bempedoic acid and 5 mg/kg atorvastatin, however, red and watery feces was observed in all 
treatment groups receiving atorvastatin (alone or in combination with bempedoic acid) which were not 
fully reversed in the recovery period. 
Genotoxicity 
Bempedoic acid was not mutagenic in the Ames test. Increases in chromosome aberration were 
observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, but only in the presence of S9 and at a 
concentration associated with a level of cytotoxicity that approached or exceeded the maximum 
permissible. No DNA damage in the liver (rat) and genotoxic effects in bone marrow in rats and mice 
were observed. It can, therefore, be concluded that these studies indicate that bempedoic acid is not 
genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of bempedoic acid was evaluated in a 2-year study in mice and rats. In 
mice, bempedoic acid was administered daily orally at doses of 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg/day. In males, 
an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was observed at the mid dose and 
higher in a dose-responsive manner. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 31/154 
 
 
 
In a 2-year study, rats were administered daily oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid. 
Treatment was associated with an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular 
cell adenomas in male rats. In both rats and mice, no carcinogenic potential was observed in females. 
The applicant suggests that the bempedoic acid-related increases in tumor incidence are attributable to 
PPARα activity. Indeed, this theory is consistent with the results observed in the repeated dose studies 
in rats (but not monkeys) and in vitro studies showing low potency activation of PPARα in the liver, but 
the absence of PPAR-mediated adverse effects in other organs (heart, skeletal muscles and bone 
marrow). Furthermore, the carcinogenic response is similar to that observed in mice and rats treated 
with other PPARα agonists. Since it is known that PPARα activation-mediated mechanism of tumor 
development is rodent-specific, the observed carcinogenesis in the liver is not considered relevant for 
humans. In addition, the development of thyroid tumors in rats is considered to be secondary to 
increased liver metabolism of thyroid hormone (related with PPARα activators) and is therefore also not 
considered relevant for humans. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In the repeated dose toxicity study in mice, testes and seminal vesicle weight were decreased, 
associated with seminiferous tubule degeneration/atrophy. 
In the combined oral fertility Study in rats, treated males were mated with treated females from the 
same dose group. Although no effects were observed on fertility indices, a decreased number of 
corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable embryos, and litter size was observed at the mid dose and an 
increase in estrous cycle length and pre-implantation loss, as well as a decrease in sperm count (16%) 
were observed at the high dose. 
Extrapolation from rat TK repeat dose studies indicates that exposure at the NOAEL was 5 times below 
those obtained in humans. These findings are likely relevant for humans. 
In the rat embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident from the mid-dose on, 
which, according to the applicant, resulted in foetal toxicity in the form of reduced fetal weight and an 
increased number of skeletal malformations and variations. These effects can be considered as skeletal 
retardations, associated with delays in ossification, and are transient and reversible after birth. 
In the rabbit embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident at the high dose, 
however, no effects on fetal development or induction of malformations or variations were observed in 
the rabbit. The NOAEL for development was 80 mg/kg (AUC0-24 of ETC-1002 plus ESP15228 3906 
μg
hr/mL), associated with approximately 12 times human exposure at 180 mg/day. 
In the pre- and postnatal development study in the rat, bempedoic acid produced excessive maternal 
⋅
toxicity and increased neonatal mortality at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 pup growth, survival, 
and behavioural assessments (slower learning) was 5 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for the postweaning 
maturation and reproductive performance of the F1 generation was 20 mg/kg/day. Extrapolation from 
other studies indicates that exposures at the NOAEL for the postweaning maturation and reproductive 
performance were similar to those obtained in humans. These findings are likely relevant for humans. 
In a dose range finding study in juvenile rats, toxicity leading to excessive body weight loss and 
moribundity was seen at a dose of 60/30 mg/kg/day. A dose of 10 mg/kg/day was therefore chosen as 
the high dose in the pivotal juvenile Study. 
In the dose range finding study and the pivotal Study, a similar toxicological profile compared to that 
found in adult rats was observed, including decreased body weight gain, decreased red cell mass, 
increased cholesterol and reversible, adaptive liver changes. Exposures at the NOAEL in juvenile rats 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 32/154 
 
 
 
(10 mg/kg/day) were approximately 0.2 times exposure in humans at 180 mg/day, comparable to 
exposures in adult rats at the NOAEL. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Maximal exposure multiples achieved in the toxicology studies were in general sufficient: Based on 
AUC0-24h, for bempedoic acid it was up to 26x, 18x, 11x and 16x human AUC (at MRHD) in mice, 
rats, rabbits and monkeys respectively. For ESP15228 it was up to 14x, 7.8x, 2.9x and 18x human 
AUC in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys respectively. In juvenile rats, the exposure was low, maximally 
1.2x the (adult) human exposure to bempedoic acid and below human exposure for ESP15228. It is 
noted that the applicant uses human systemic exposures (AUC0-24) of 289 and 51.2 μg∙hr/mL for 
bempedoic acid and ESP15228, respectively (sum 340 μg∙hr/mL). Since the origin of these values is 
not clear, the assessor has used the values derived from Study 1002-035 instead to calculate exposure 
margins.   
The metabolite ESP15228 was a minor metabolite in mice, rats and rabbits (around 5% of bempedoic 
acid or less). ESP15228 was a larger metabolite in monkeys (around 10% of bempedoic acid or more).  
In mice, rats and monkeys, mortality was observed starting at exposures between 7 and 14 times the 
systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. The proposed mechanism for the mortality is severe 
hypoglycaemia occurring at exposures in excess of those required for the pharmacologic activity of 
bempedoic acid. 
Effects on red blood cell mass in mice, rats and monkeys and were observed already at low dose 
levels, corresponding to 0.15 (rat) to 6.2 times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. The 
effects were moderate (≤15%), and no meaningful effects were observed in the clinical studies and are 
therefore not considered relevant for humans. However, decreases in APTT and PT were also observed 
in rats at exposure levels ≥ 0.15 the systemic exposure in humans at MRHD.  Although the findings 
lack microscopic correlates, we do not agree with the applicant that changes up to 38% are not 
clinically relevant. Especially in combination with anticoagulants risks due to interactions cannot be 
excluded. 
Bempedoic acid also results in hepatic toxicity, starting with increased levels of hepatic enzymes and 
progressing via hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolation and in rats also to necrosis. The effects are 
more pronounced in rats and mice than in monkeys which can be explained by the known adaptive 
response of rodents as well as by the fact that bempedoic acid metabolism is shifted more towards the 
liver in rodents than in monkeys and humans. In the monkey, the most relevant species for humans, 
periportal or diffuse vacuolation in the liver was observed in the 12-month study at exposure levels 
twice the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. 
Increased plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were also observed in the 12 months starting at 
exposure levels twice the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. However, up to 13 times human 
exposure at 180 mg, no microscopic changes in the kidney were observed. 
In the reproductive toxicity studies in rats, decreased corpora lutea and implantation sites, increased 
post-implantation loss and resorptions and reduced foetal body weight were observed at exposures 4 
times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. In addition, increased incidence of foetal skeletal 
findings in the scapula and long bones, as well as reductions in numbers of live pups and pup survival, 
pup growth and learning, were observed at exposures below the systemic exposure in humans at 180 
mg. Considering the low or absent exposure margins, it is concluded that these effects might be 
relevant to humans.

A combination of bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day) and ezetimibe (750 mg/kg/day in male rats, 250 
mg/kg/day in non-pregnant female rats and 183-720 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats) had no effect on the 
exposure to bempedoic acid and ESP15228 in rats (males and non-pregnant females as well as 
pregnant rats), compared to administration of bempedoic acid alone. 
Effects of the combination on ezetimibe exposure were not consistent, most likely due to extensive 
enterohepatic cycling of ezetimibe/ezetimibe glucuronide. When ezetimibe was combined with 30 
mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide increased at least 2 times. 
In combination with 10 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, only a slight increase in exposure (approximately 
10-30%) was observed. 
In the 3-month study in rats with combination treatment of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, no adverse 
effects were observed up to 30/750 mg/kg/day (males) and 30/250 mg/kg/day (females). At these 
dose levels, systemic exposure (based on AUC0-24) to ezetimibe plus ezetimibe glucuronide is 23 
times (males) or 191 times (females) exposure in humans at 10 mg/day. Systemic exposure to ETC-
1002 plus ESP15228 at these doses is 1.5-2.5 times exposure in humans at 180 mg/day. This is 
considered sufficient. 
The exposures to bempedoic acid, ESP15228, atorvastatin and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin in cynomolgus 
monkeys were not significantly affected by the combination compared to when bempedoic acid (20 
mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) were administered alone. 
In the pivotal 3-month study in monkeys with combination treatment of bempedoic acid and 
atorvastatin, red and watery feces was observed in all treatment groups receiving 5 mg/kg 
atorvastatin. At this dose level, systemic exposure to atorvastatin plus 2-hydroxyatorvastatin is 0.8 
times exposure in humans at 80 mg/day, which means that there is no safety margin. No bempedoic 
acid-related adverse effects were observed in the groups receiving up to 20 mg/kg bempedoic acid, a 
dose that resulted in systemic exposure levels to ETC-1002 plus ESP15228 of 3-4 times the exposure 
in humans at 180 mg/day, which is considered small, but sufficient. 
Interspecies comparison 
Bempedoic acid was absorbed moderately fast (Tmax 1-3.5 h in humans, 2 h in rats at 10 mg/kg, 4 h 
in pregnant rabbits, 1 h in monkeys). In rats at 100 mg/kg, Tmax was 8 h, but at that dose there was 
probably saturation of an absorption mechanism. Oral bioavailability was not directly investigated. It 
was at least 90% in rats and at least 49% in monkeys. Exposure to bempedoic acid increased dose-
proportionally in mice. In rats and monkeys, exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at 
lower doses (rat up to 100 mg/kg/day, monkey up to 60 mg/kg/day) and less than dose-proportionally 
at higher doses. In humans, steady-state pharmacokinetics were generally linear over a range of > 60 
mg to 220 mg.  
No consistent gender effects were observed in mice and monkeys. In rats, no gender effect was 
observed in the exposure to bempedoic acid. Exposure to ESP15228 was slightly lower in females than 
in males in adult rats, but not in juvenile rats. In humans, females had a 41% greater increase in 
steady-state AUC compared with males. 
In mice and rats, upon multiple dosing, an exposure generally decreased with time. In pregnant 
rabbits, monkeys and humans, exposure increased with time (accumulation ratio ≤ 2, 2.0-2.4 and 2.3 
in pregnant rabbits, monkeys and humans respectively). 
Protein binding of bempedoic acid was high and similar between species (mouse, rat, monkey, human) 
up to 100 µg/mL (94-97%). In rats, bempedoic acid distributed to a volume less than the extracellular 
fluid (Vd/F was 123 mL/kg). In humans, Vz/F was 18 L, corresponding approximately to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 34/154 
 
 
 
extracellular fluid (Davies & Morris, 1993). In all species, bempedoic acid did not preferentially 
partition into red blood cells. 
The major circulating metabolites in monkeys and humans were bempedoic acid, bempedoic acid 
glucuronide, ESP15228 and ESP15228 glucuronide. In rat plasma, the glucuronides of bempedoic acid 
and ESP15228 were not present. Instead, mono-hydroxymethyl bempedoic acid was present in the 
plasma of rats. 
The elimination half-life was comparable in rats (18-27 h), monkeys (18 h) and humans (16-33 h). In 
pregnant rabbits, elimination half-life was shorter (10-13 h). In monkeys and humans, the largest part 
of a radioactive dose was excreted in urine (49% and 70% respectively), while in faeces, 29% and 
30% of the dose was excreted respectively. In rats only 17% of the dose was excreted in urine while 
86% was excreted in bile.  
In combination studies with ezetimibe in rats and humans, ezetimibe did not affect the exposure to 
bempedoic acid. In rats, exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide increased at least 2 times in 
combination with 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid but not in combination with 10 mg/kg/day bempedoic 
acid. In humans, total ezetimibe increased 1.6-1.8 times in combination with bempedoic acid. 
In combination studies with atorvastatin in monkeys and humans, atorvastatin did not affect the 
exposure to bempedoic acid. In monkey, bempedoic acid did not affect atorvastatin exposure while in 
humans only a small increase (1.4x) was observed. 
Local Tolerance  
Bempedoic acid is intended for oral route of administration, and therefore local tolerance studies are 
not needed.  
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
Three alkyl compounds in the synthesis of bempedoic acid contain halides and may, therefore, be 
mutagenic. The starting material 1-bromo-5-chloropentane and a synthetic intermediate heptanoic 
acid, 2,2-dimethyl-7-iodo-ethyl ester (CION-02) were evaluated in bacterial mutagenicity assays. No 
evidence for mutagenicity was observed. The third compound (CION-01) is similar to CION-02 
(contains chlorine instead of iodine) was considered to be not mutagenic given the results for CION-02. 
In addition, the potential impurity CION-08-diol was evaluated for mutagenic potential using in silico 
methods. No structural alerts associated with mutagenicity were found. 
PPAR activity 
The applicant performed several In Vitro Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Assays. The 
results indicate that bempedoic acid binding has low potential to activate the PPARα or PPARγ 
pathways and no potential to activate the PPARδ pathway. 
Exploratory mechanisms of toxicity 
Studies towards the mechanism of toxicity of bempedoic acid were performed in rats and monkeys. In 
those studies, high doses of bempedoic acid (100-300 mg/kg) resulted in dose- and time-dependent 
decreases in plasma glucose in both species, with a reduction of up to 72%-80% in surviving animals, 
but even more in animals that needed to be euthanized. In addition, hypoglycemia-induced clinical 
signs were observed in rats and monkeys, including decreased activity, emesis and vomiting (repeated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 35/154 
 
 
 
and occurring in primates only), hunched posture, pallor and tremors. All these effects were reversed 
during recovery. Further studies indicated that glucose uptake and utilization pathways remain intact. 
In rat, mild increases in lactate and pyruvate were observed. Nevertheless, increased glucose oxidation 
as the mechanism for hypoglycemia is not likely to be a major contributor since analysis of lactate and 
pyruvate do not indicate a change in glucose oxidation in monkeys. Therefore, it is concluded that the 
mechanism leading to decreases in glucose after exposure to high doses of bempedoic acid likely is 
decreased gluconeogenesis. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bempedoic acid is considered to be not PBT, nor vPvB. A risk to the STP, surface water, groundwater, 
sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated based on the prescribed use of bempedoic 
acid. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In general, the non-clinical pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid have been adequately investigated. 
However, in the validation of the LC-MS/MS methods which were used to analyse bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228 in serum, medium QC was chosen consequently lower than recommended in the Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev 1 Corr 2) (at approximately 
10% of the calibration curve range instead of at 30 – 50% as recommended in the guideline). The 
applicant has performed additional partial validations of the LC-MS/MS methods, including QCs at 
around 30 to 50% of the calibration curve range as recommended by the EMA guidance. Reported 
intra-run accuracy and precision values are adequate. 
The results indicate that atorvastatin in combination with bempedoic acid can result in excessive 
toxicity. According to the applicant, no adverse effects were observed at a combination of 20 mg/kg 
bempedoic acid and 5 mg/kg atorvastatin. However, in the pivotal 3-month study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (RR 1002-500-065), red and watery feces was observed in all treatment groups receiving 
atorvastatin (alone or in combination with bempedoic acid), which were not fully reversed in the 
recovery period. According to the applicant, changes in stool are common, stress related effects in 
monkeys. The fecal abnormalities were already observed in all groups before treatment started. 
Moreover, the discoloured feces in recovery animals were grey or green, but not red or bloody and the 
lack of clinical chemistry changes as well as the absence of gross or microscopic findings in the 
histological analysis at termination, indicates that no intestinal injuries were present. Since also in the 
clinical studies no meaningful gastrointestinal adverse events were observed, it can be concluded that 
the observed fecal abnormalities in monkeys do not raise concern for humans. 
The bempedoic acid-dependent hypoglycemia and clinical signs of moribundity were evident with 
high dose exposure in non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies in rodent and monkeys. However, such 
effects occur only at exposure levels not relevant for humans. In addition, the biochemical changes 
leading to morbidity and death were reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, and upon 
administration of high carbohydrate nutritional supplements. 
Decreases in APTT and PT were observed in rats at exposure levels ≥ 0.15 the systemic exposure in 
humans at 180 mg.  The changes in coagulation parameters in the non-clinical studies were not 
consistent across species and no microscopic correlates were observed. More importantly, in clinical 
studies, APTT and PT were found not to be affected. The effects on coagulation as observed in animals, 
are therefore considered not relevant for humans.

In the rat embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident from the mid-dose (30 
mg/kg) on, which, according to the applicant, resulted in foetal toxicity in the form of reduced foetal 
weight and an increased number of skeletal malformations and variations. However, starting at the low 
dose (10 mg/kg), there was a statistically significant increase in bent scapula and bent ribs, without 
any evidence of maternal toxicity. These effects can be considered as skeletal retardations, associated 
with delays in ossification, and are transient and reversible after birth. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that bempedoic acid 
mediates its effects on cholesterol metabolism via ACL-dependent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. 
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the rats and monkeys were the most relevant species for non-
clinical efficacy and safety studies. 
Overall, the nonclinical safety profile of bempedoic acid has been adequately characterized.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical method 
Three bioanalytical methods were used for the quantitation of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002) and 
ESP15228 in plasma throughout the clinical development programme. Both ETC-1002 as ESP15228 
were measured in plasma using LC-MS/MS. Protein precipitation with acetonitrile or solid phase 
extraction was used to extract both analytes from plasma. The concentrations of ECT-1002-glucuronide 
have not been quantified. 
The applicant used a validated LC-MS/MS method for the analysis for Ezetimibe and Ezetimibe – 
glucuronide in plasma. Bioanalytical reports were also submitted for several drugs used in the DDI 
studies.  
Statistical analysis 
Standard pharmacokinetic parameters have been estimated using both non-compartmental methods 
and population pharmacokinetic analyses. In the statistical comparison of most studies, a mixed effects 
model was used with subject within sequence as random effect. The applicant also provided additional 
re-analysis for several bioequivalence and DDI studies using fixed-effects for sequence, subject within 
sequence, period, and formulation/treatment as a sensitivity analysis. 
Two population pharmacokinetic analyses were submitted by the applicant. The first population 
pharmacokinetic analysis characterised the pharmacokinetics of both ETC-1002 and ESP15228 in 11 
phase 1 and 2 studies. Mainly densely sampled studies were included in the analysis. The 
pharmacokinetics were best described using a 3-compartment model (central and peripheral 
compartment for the parent, and a central compartment for the metabolite). A model with parallel 
linear and non-linear formation of the metabolite was considered the base model with the lowest 
objective function value. Pre-defined covariates were fitted simultaneously with a pre-specified 
structure. Due to long runtimes, the model was reduced to a linear formation pathway of the 
metabolite. This is considered acceptable as the non-linear component appears to be primarily involved 
in the lower concentration range and not in the therapeutic exposure range  
The second population pharmacokinetic analysis quantified the pharmacokinetics of the parent, ETC-
1002, in 22 phase 1 to 3 studies. The final popPK dataset included 2232 subjects with 10347 
quantifiable PK samples, 184 (8.2%) were healthy subjects, 1689 (75.6%) were hyperlipidemia 
patients and 359 (16%) had T2DM. Both dense and sparsely sampled studies were included in the 
Assessment report

analysis. The pharmacokinetics of ETC-1002 was best described using a 2-compartment model (central 
and peripheral). A transit compartment was used to describe the absorption phase of bempedoic acid. 
Pre-defined covariates were fitted simultaneously with a pre-specified structure. Backward elimination 
was used to reduce the model. Main covariates were bodyweight and renal function. Also, covariate 
effects of atorvastatin on bioavailability (12.6% increase) and simvastatin on V2/F (15.2% decrease) 
were identified.  
Also, a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was submitted based on data from 15 
phase 1 to 3 studies. This model quantified the relationship between ETC-1002 and LDL-C lowering. A 
sequential based analysis for the PK/PD modelling was intended, where the PK/PD analysis was 
conditioned upon the fitting of the PK using the individual PK parameters. An indirect response model 
describing inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, incorporating serum LDL-C turnover with inhibitory drug 
effect on the production of serum LDL-C concentration (Kin), was used (Figure 2). Concomitant 
therapy with statins or ezetimibe influenced the Imax (lower) and baseline LDL-C parameters. 
Figure 3. Indirect Response Base Model 
Absorption 
Bempedoic acid has pH dependent aqueous solubility, that is low below pH 6 but increases at higher pH 
levels. Bempedoic acid is classified as a BCS class 2 compound. Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite 
were not found to be substrates for intestinal efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP in vitro.   
Bempedoic  acid  is  absorbed  with  a  median  time  to  the  maximum  concentration  of  3.5  hours  when 
administered  orally  as  180  mg  tablets.  Bempedoic  acid  is  partially  converted  to  an  active  metabolite 
ESP15228, which has a median tmax of 7.0 hours. Concomitant food administration did not affect the 
oral  bioavailability  of  bempedoic  acid,  a  minor  influence  on  Cmax  (-12%)  was  observed  and  the 
absorption  rate  constant  decreased  by  approximately  78%.  No  absolute  bioavailability  studies  were 
conducted.  
After absorption, bempedoic acid is activated in the liver by ACSVL1 to ETC-1002-CoA , which 
subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-
3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. 
Concomitant food administration did not affect the oral bioavailability of bempedoic acid and had a 
minor influence on Cmax. In the food effect study a FDA-defined high-fat, high-calorie breakfast was 
given.

Bempedoic acid clinical program included four drug formulations, bioequivalence between developed 
formulations and to-be-marketed 180 mg immediate release tablet has been established.

 Steady state  
Steady state is reached in approximately 7-14 days. Steady-state bempedoic acid AUC and average 
plasma concentrations in patients from the three placebo-controlled phase 3 studies were consistent 
across bempedoic acid formulations used in phase 3 studies, with an AUCss, 0-24hours of about 
310h.µg/mL for bempedoic acid, Figure 4.  
Figure 5. Model predicted AUCss for studies 1002-046, 1002-047 and 1002-048 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of bempedoic acid was approximately 
16-18L. The in vitro protein binding was high ranging from 95% for ETC-1002 (parent compound) to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 43/154 
 
 
 
 
  
 
99% for both ESP15228 (active metabolite) and ETC-1002-glucuronide (inactive metabolite). The 
extent of protein binding was independent of drug concentrations. The average blood: plasma ratio 
was found to be 0.5 indicating limited distribution to the blood cells. Plasma protein binding was 
slightly affected by the degree of renal impairment. 
Elimination 
The ADME study indicated that renal clearance is the main route of elimination of bempedoic acid 
(predominantly as glucuronide metabolites), approximately 62.1% and 25.4% of the radioactivity was 
recovered from urine and faeces respectively. Metabolism accounts for more than 95% of the 
elimination of bempedoic acid after oral administration. The primary route of elimination for bempedoic 
acid is metabolism to the acyl glucuronide (Figure 5). Bempedoic acid is also reversibly converted to an 
active metabolite (ESP15228). Mean plasma AUC metabolite/parent drug ratio for ESP15228 following 
repeat-dose administration was 18% and remained constant over time.

ECT1002 and ESP15228 are both converted to inactive glucuronide conjugates in vitro by UGT2B7. After 
administration of a single dose of bempedoic acid, ECT1002, ESP15228 and their respective conjugated

forms were detected in plasma with ECT1002 accounting for the majority (46%) of the AUC0-48h and 
its glucuronide being the next most prevalent (30%). ESP15228 and its glucuronide represented 10% 
and 11% of the plasma AUC0-48h, respectively. In the ADME study, the unchanged parent and its active 
metabolite could be detected in faeces but accounted for less than 2% of total administered radioactivity. 
In urine, the majority of the sample radioactivity was associated with an acyl glucuronide of bempedoic 
acid.  Three  additional  metabolites:  an  acid  metabolite  of  ETC-1002,  mono  hydroxymethyl-ESP15228, 
and a taurine conjugate of ETC-1002 where described in faeces. 
The apparent steady-state clearance (CL/F) of bempedoic acid was 11.2 mL/min and the mean half-life 
was 19 hours at steady-state.  The terminal half-life of ESP15228 was approximately 30 hours. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of ESP15228 appeared to be formation rate 
limited and best described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The steady state concentrations of the major 
inactive metabolite, ETC-1002-glucuronide, have not been determined yet, but will be determined post 
marketing, see section VII. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Bempedoic acid AUC0-24,ss and Cmax appear to increase more than proportional with increasing 
dose>120 mg to 250 mg.  
No time dependency has been observed for bempedoic acid. Accumulation ratios were approximately 
2.3 for ETC-1002 and approximately 3 for ESP15228. 
Inter-individual variability  
The inter-individual variability (CV%) of Cmax and AUCt values for bempedoic acid was moderate 
(30% and 33%, respectively) when 180 mg QD dosing regimen was used in healthy subjects. Similar 
inter-individual variability was reported for ESP15228 exposure parameters. Intra-individual variability 
is approximately 34%. Intra-individual variability is comparable between healthy subjects and patients, 
however inter-individual variability is higher in patients as indicated by the estimates of the population 
pharmacokinetic model 
In a popPK analysis, the inter-individual variability estimates for apparent drug clearance (CL/F), 
apparent central distribution volume (V2/F) and absorption rate constant (Ka) were 29.7%, 100% and 
73.9%, respectively. 
Special populations 
Bempedoic acid and ESP15228 exposure as measured by AUC increased with increasing degree of 
renal impairment; Cmax (after a single dose) was not substantially affected by renal impairment. The 
same trends have been observed for the unbound fractions of ETC-1002 and ESP15228. The clearance 
of ETC-1002 and ESP15228 is decreased in patients with renal impairment. An approximately 1.4-fold 
increase in AUC for patients with mild renal impairment and 1.9-fold increase in AUC for patients with 
moderate renal impairment have been observed in population PK analysis. No studies on patients with 
ESRD or on hemodialysis were performed. 
Total bempedoic acid exposure (ETC-1002 and active metabolite ESP15228) was reduced by 27% and 
21%in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment relative to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease is not expected to be clinically relevant, and no 
dose adjustments are required for subjects with hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 45/154 
 
 
 
not studied. The lack of data in patients with severe hepatic impairment is appropriately reflected in 
proposed SmPC. 
From the population PK model, it can be determined that patients with a lower bodyweight will have an 
increased exposure. This is also confirmed by the additional analysis in which the applicant evaluated 
the relationship between observed trough concentrations with bodyweight. As the difference was 
relatively small, no dose adjustments are necessary. Females had a 40% higher exposure to 
bempedoic acid. However, this is most likely caused by weight differences between both genders. 
There appears to be a trend for increasing exposure with age in the population pharmacokinetic model 
and greater variability in black subject and a trend lower exposure in Hispanic subjects. However, the 
influence of age, race and ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid should be interpreted 
with caution as there are issues with the selection of covariates in the population pharmacokinetic 
model. The influence of age race and ethnicity should therefore be re-evaluated after model 
refinement.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
In in vitro studies bempedoic acid inhibits renal transporter OAT3 with IC50 values of about 40µg/mL. 
Bempedoic acid also inhibited the hepatic and renal transporter OAT2, but different IC50 values were 
observed for different substrates. The estimates IC50 was 1.24 µg/mL for uric acid, 88.9µg/mL for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 46/154 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine and 142 µg/mL for cGMP. The substrate dependency is not understood and will be further 
evaluated post marketing, see section VII. 
The IC50 bempedoic acid concentrations were 119 µg/mL for the hepatic transporters OATP1B1, and 
152 µg/mL for OATP1B3 and the Inlet Cmax(u)*25 was 48 µg/mL so weak inhibition is expected. ETC-
1002 glucuronide inhibits OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at IC50 concentrations of 43 and 43 µg/mL, 
respectively. 
No significant in vitro inhibition or induction of the of Cytochrome P450 enzymes by bempedoic acid or 
its active metabolite ESP15228 was observed.  
Bempedoic acid is not an inducer of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations, 
however some induction of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 has been observed at supra therapeutic 
concentrations. These results are in line with the results of clinical DDI studies. 
Further, the applicant has conducted vitro study to investigate the potential interactions of the inactive 
ETC 1002-glucuronide. The interactions with Cytochrome P450 enzymes, the transporters OAT1, OAT3, 
and OCT2 and the transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, and P-glycoprotein were investigated. ETC-
1002-glucuronide was not a reversible or time dependent inhibitor in vitro of the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A enzymes in the concentration range 
of 0 to 133 μM. No final conclusions on these studies can be drawn due to the lack of steady state 
concentration data on ETC 1002-glucuronide.  
In vivo 
The applicant conducted two drug-drug interaction studies with a statin in which the effect of steady-
state bempedoic acid 180mg (Study 1002-037) or 240 mg (study1002-012) on the single-dose plasma 
pharmacokinetics of different statins was investigated. Study subjects were included in cohorts and 
treated with different statins (12 subjects per cohort). Elevations in systemic statin exposure as 
assessed by the steady-state AUC ratio were observed for the different statins in studies 1002-037 and 
1002-012 (See table 3). In the study with the higher 240mg dose of bempedoic acid a 2-fold increase 
for pravastatin, 1.7-fold for rosuvastatin and 2-fold for simvastatin was observed. In the study with the 
180 mg bempedoic acid an increased exposure of simvastatin of 2-fold, atorvastatin of 1.4-fold (with 
increases of relevant active metabolites of 1.5- and 2.2-fold), pravastatin 1.5-fold, and rosuvastatin 
1.5-fold has been observed. Statin Cmax concentrations were also increased by a similar extent, 
suggesting that not only the excretion but also the first pass effect of statins is affected. According to 
the applicant, the interaction can probably be attributed to inhibition of OATP transport.  
Steady state concentrations of bempedoic acid were not affected by a single dose administration of any 
of the statins. The effect of steady state statin on the exposure of bempedoic acid has not been 
estimated.

The pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid was not affected in the presence of ezetimibe at steady state. 
Increases in AUC and Cmax for unconjugated ezetimibe were observed, but these increases were less 
than 20% during steady-state exposure of bempedoic acid. Total ezetimibe (ezetimibe and its 
glucuronide form) and ezetimibe glucuronide AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.6-fold and 1.8-
fold, respectively. Due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by BA the hepatic uptake of ezetimibe-glucuronide is 
decreased and subsequently its elimination is decreased  
The DDI study with the general UGT and OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor probenecid showed an increased 
exposure of 1.7 and 1.95-fold for ETC-1002 and ESP15228. 
Although, in vitro studies indicated that there may be a clinically relevant interaction with the OAT3 or 
OAT2 transporters, no clinical interaction studies with substrates of OAT3 or OAT2 were conducted. In 
the clinical studies, elevations of uric acid and creatinine were observed. According to the applicant, 
these elevations can possibly be attributed to inhibition of OAT2.  
The applicant proposes to further investigate the DDI liability of bempedoic acid as the precipitant of 
OAT2 interactions with clinically relevant drugs and the role of OAT2 in explaining the effects of 
bempedoic acid on creatinine and uric acid in five additional in vitro studies (see section VII) and one 
NC study.   
Bempedoic acid did not influence the pharmacokinetics of hormonal contraceptives and metformin. 
Also, no effect was observed on the pharmacodynamics of metformin. 
Based on popPK analysis, concomitant medications (statins, metformin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 
inhibitors) had no significant impact on bempedoic acid PK. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The median maximal concentration of approximately 20 µg/mL observed after the administration of a 
180 mg dose of bempedoic acid at steady can be used for the safety evaluation. However, it should be 
taken into account that some individuals demonstrated concentrations as high as 70 µg/mL after the 
administration of 180 mg bempedoic acid at steady state 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In the liver, bempedoic acid is activated to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA), which 
subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-
3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Inhibition of 
cholesterol synthesis triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) 
expression in the liver resulting in increased clearance of LDL particles and lowering of LDL-C in the 
blood.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Bempedoic acid requires coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 
(ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA (Pinkosky et al, 2016). Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in 
decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of LDL-Rs 
(Figure 7) ETC-1002-CoA (via ACL inhibition) and statins (via HMG-CoA reductase inhibition) both 
inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver; however, bempedoic acid is inactive in skeletal muscle. 
Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in concomitant suppression of hepatic fatty acid 
biosynthesis and it is this aspect of the activity that is thought to lead to improvements in glycemic 
control in hyperglycemic animal models. 
Figure 8. Mechanism of Action of Bempedoic Acid 
Schematic overview of the mechanism of action of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002). (1) Bempedoic acid is 
converted to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA) in the liver and (2) inhibits ATP citrate lyase 
(ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in the 
cholesterol synthesis pathway.  Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (3) reduces intracellular cholesterol 
levels, which (4) triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in the liver 
resulting in (5) increased clearance of LDL particles and reduced LDL-C in the blood.   
Phase 1 PK/PD studies 
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending multiple-dose studies evaluated fasting 
lipid parameters in healthy subjects. Subjects (n=53) received bempedoic acid 20, 60, 100, or 120 mg 
or placebo QD in a 3:1 ratio (Study 1002-002, Cohorts 1-4); or (n=24) bempedoic acid 140, 180, 
220 mg, or placebo (Study 1002-004) QD for 14 days.  In both studies, blood samples for fasting lipids 
(calculated LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, and TGs) were collected predose and on Day 1, 4, 8, and 15.   
Percent change from baseline to Day 15 in calculated LDL-C is illustrated in Figure 8 and Table 4 
below. LDL-cholesterol lowering was evident starting at Day 4 and near maximum LDL-C lowering 
appear to have been achieved by Day 15.

patients onto (PCSK9i) therapy (evolocumab). Following a washout period of all LMT, patients received 
run-in treatment with evolocumab for 3 months, after which they were randomized 1:1 to add on 
bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo QD for 2 months. Basic fasting lipids, apo B, hsCRP, and trough 
plasma concentrations of ETC-1002 (parent compound) and ESP15228 (active metabolite) were 
assessed at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2.   
An additive reduction in LDL-C was observed when bempedoic acid was added to evolocumab, with an 
LS mean change from baseline of -27.5% compared with 2.8% in the placebo + evolocumab group; 
the LS mean difference from placebo (-30.3%) was statistically significant (p <0.001), Figure 9. 
Figure 10: Mean (± SEM) LDL-C Values by Visit (LOCF) (Study 1002-039) 
Secondary pharmacology: QT prolongation 
A thorough QT study was performed to assess potential effects of bempedoic acid on the QT interval. 
Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the following oral QD treatments on Days 1 
through 9: (A) bempedoic acid 240 mg + matched-to-moxifloxacin placebo; 
(B) matched-to-bempedoic acid placebo + 1 matched-to-moxifloxacin placebo; or (C) moxifloxacin 
400 mg and matched-to-bempedoic acid placebo.  
Based on the unadjusted and mixed-effects regression models using both time-matched and predose 
baselines, bempedoic acid did not affect QTcF. The expected extent and pattern of change in QTcF 
during moxifloxacin treatment was observed, with statistically significant elevations in time-matched, 
placebo- and baseline-adjusted QTcF (ddQTcF) from 1 to 16 hours postdose on Day 9, Figure 10.

The QTcF interval did not exceed 450 msec at any time point in the bempedoic acid group and change 
from baseline in QTcF did not exceed 30 msec in any bempedoic acid-treated subject. There were no 
clinically significant changes in heart rate, PR interval, or QRS duration in subjects who received 
bempedoic acid. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, the pharmacokinetics were adequately characterised in the clinical pharmacology 
programme of bempedoic acid.  
The submitted bioanalytical methods are validated and in general suitable for the analysis of ETC-1002 
and the active metabolite ESP15228 in plasma, ultrafiltrate and urine. ETC-1002-glucuronide, the main 
metabolite (21-36% in plasma), was not analysed in the clinical development programme of 
bempedoic acid. The company committed to measure steady state concentrations of ETC-1002-
glucuronide to enable correct interpretation of the in vitro interaction studies (PAM). 
The analytical methods for the drugs used in the DDI studies were appropriately validated.  
In the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, some issues 
needed to be clarified during the procedure but the clarifications were accepted by the CHMP.  
With respect to the population PK/PD model, individual ETAs for CL, V2 and KA were used for the 
prediction of exposure. It was unclear how the PK model, which is mainly fixed due to the sequential 
approach, influences the PD model. On top of that, the applicant stated that the structural PK model 
from the second population pharmacokinetic analysis was used in the PK/PD analysis. However, the 
PK/PD model included estimates (K25 and K52) for a third compartment from a model that was not 
submitted. The applicant was asked to submit the report of the PK model used in PK-PD analysis 
including model development, GOF plots, VPCs, parameter estimates and model code to allow correct 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 52/154 
 
 
 
 
interpretation of the PK/PD model. The applicant submitted the requested information and conducted 
an additional sensitivity analysis, in which the PK/PD model was estimated using different PK model 
structures. The results indicated that the different structural model of the PK model only demonstrated 
a minimal influence on the parameter estimates. Therefore, this issue was sufficiently addressed. From 
the provided goodness-of-fit plots, there remain signs of structural model misspecification as most of 
the variability seems to be solved using interindividual random effects (IPRED vs DV and PRED vs DV 
plots, see population PK/PD report). The applicant performed additional outlier analysis (n = 37), 
however these outliers were not expected to influence the model structure.  
This population PK/PD model has been used to justify that statin use was a significant covariate on 
bempedoic acid maximum inhibitory effect (Imax) and was associated with a reduction of LDL-C 
lowering when bempedoic acid was added to a stable statin regimen.  The magnitude of the effect on 
Imax was dependent on statin-intensity, ie, higher statin intensities decreased the bempedoic acid 
Imax on LDL-C.  Low-, moderate- and high-intensity statins were predicted to result in a typical 
maximum LDL-C lowering of -25%, -23% and -19%, respectively. The population PK/PD model cannot 
adequately describe the structural trends after inclusion of significant covariates. However, the DDI 
studies with statins demonstrated a similar trend as the population PK/PD, although the magnitude 
of the effects are slightly different. The DDI studies showed that a higher statin dose resulted in a 
lower LDL reduction by bempedoic acid. Therefore, the DDI studies are considered pivotal in this 
argumentation. Bempedoic acid peak plasma concentration are observed after 3.5 hours when 
administered as 180 mg tablets. Median tmax for the active metabolite ESP15228 was 7 hours. 
Bempedoic acid is extensively metabolised, to mainly to glucuronide conjugates. No pharmacokinetic 
profile of bempedoic acid-glucuronide, the most predominant metabolite, has been submitted.  
The aqueous solubility of bempedoic acid is pH dependent - being low below pH 6 but increasing at 
higher pH levels. Although bempedoic acid exhibits pH-dependent solubility in vitro, the high oral 
absorption in vivo (of approximately 90%) and a lack of food effect support it can be assumed that 
impact of increasing pH induced by co-administrated medicinal products is not expected to have an 
effect on bempedoic acid absorption. 
In patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, bempedoic acid exposure increases by 2-
fold. At this stage as the exposure-response relationship of bempedoic acid has only been determined 
for LDL-C and no clear influence on other markers and safety parameters. The applicant discussed the 
mechanisms involved in the impaired elimination of bempedoic acid in patients with renal impairment. 
Possible explanations are a reduced activity of UGT2B7 or a possible higher contribution of 
enterohepatic cycling of the ETC-1002-glucuronide metabolite. These mechanisms still need to be 
confirmed.  No studies on patients with ESRD/on hemodialysis were performed. Lack of data on these 
patient’s groups is reflected in proposed SmPC. The slightly higher exposure for renally excreted drug 
in >75yrs patients compared to the patients < 65yrs is expected due to the well-described relationship 
between age and renal function. 
Bempedoic acid mainly undergoes direct glucuronidation via UGTs and is not metabolised by CYP450 
enzymes. Glucuronidation by UGT2B7 is the main route of elimination of bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228. As UGT2B7 is considered to be a highly polymorphic gene, no clear effects on clearance are 
however observed as indicated by the distribution of CL/F in the population pharmacokinetic model. 
In vitro studies indicated that bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228 do not inhibit 
CYP450 enzymes and has minimal potential to induce CYP450 enzymes at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
Elevations of in systemic statin exposure as assessed by the steady-state AUC ratio were 
observed for the different statins in two drug-drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers in which 
the effect of steady state bempedoic acid 180mg (Study 1002-037) or 240 mg (study1002-012) on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 53/154 
 
 
 
single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of different statins was investigated. An increase of 1.5- to 2- 
fold for pravastatin, 1.5- to 1.7- fold for rosuvastatin, 1.4-fold for atorvastatin (with increases of 
relevant active metabolites of 1.5- and 2.2-fold increase) and 2-fold for simvastatin was observed. 
These studies are in line with the requirements of the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug 
interactions [CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**] and would generally be acceptable as this 
approximately reflects the steady state interaction in clinical situations. The pharmacokinetic 
interaction between statins and bempedoic acid is probably caused by OATP1B1 inhibition. In in vitro 
studies, bempedoic acid and its glucuronide weakly inhibited OATP1B1 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. OATP1B1 is an uptake transporter expressed on the hepatocytes and involved in the 
hepatic uptake of statins. The hepatocyte is the site of action of statins and statins are metabolised in 
the hepatocyte. Due to a high first-pass effect (the absolute bioavailability is 5% for simvastatin, 12% 
for atorvastatin 17% for pravastatin and 20% for rosuvastatin) and efficient first uptake into the 
hepatocyte OATP inhibition may not only impact the systemic absolute bioavailability but also the 
pharmacodynamics of statins. OATP is not expressed in myocyte and therefore not involved in the 
uptake of statins into the myocyte. As the impact of the interaction with bempedoic acid appears to be 
dose dependent (a higher increase of rosuvastatin and pravastatin exposure was observed with the 
higher dose of bempedoic acid) the impact may potentially be higher in patients with a higher 
bempedoic acid exposure (e.g. patients with renal impairment).  
In clinical studies, the total LDL-C reduction was a combined effect of statin and bempedoic acid. 
As both active substances act on the same pathway the contribution of the individual active substances 
to the lipid lowering effect cannot be measured accurately but has been estimated via modeling. These 
estimations should be interpreted with caution as dose-exposure-response relationships is not 
proportional, linear and similar for each statin. The observed interaction between bempedoic acid and 
statins may also contribute to tolerability issues observed.  
The combined administration of ezetimibe and bempedoic acid resulted in an increase in 
exposure of 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide, respectively. Some 
difference in efficacy is noticed in the subgroup analyses in the clinical studies, but the interaction was 
not significant (see clinical efficacy section). Further, it is known that the dose response relationship of 
ezetimibe is rather flat. The impact on clinical safety limited, no dose dependent safety issues are 
known for ezetimibe within the clinical dose range and no notable differences in adverse events profile 
could be identified between patients concomitantly treated with or without ezetimibe.  
In in vitro studies bempedoic acid inhibits renal transporter OAT3 with IC50 values of about 40µg/mL 
In vitro data predict a weak inhibition of OAT3 and also by the limited impact of bempedoic acid on the 
pharmacokinetics of the OAT3-OATP1B1 substrate pravastatine. In DDI study 1002-037, a 1.46-fold 
increase of pravastatin exposure has been observed when coadministered with 180mg bempedoic acid 
and up to 2 fold increase with the supra therapeutic 240mg dose. Potential interaction mechanisms 
include interaction with hepatic uptake (via OATP1B1) and renal elimination (via OAT3) of pravastatin. 
Bempedoic acid has a combined effect on both mechanisms but the impact is limited.  
Bempedoic acid also inhibited the hepatic and renal transporter OAT2, but different IC50 values were 
observed for different substrates. The estimates IC50 was 1.24 µg/mL for uric acid, 88.9µg/mL for 
creatinine and 142 µg/mL for cGMP. The substrate dependency is not understood. The applicant 
committed to further investigate the role of OAT2 inhibition by bempedoic acid in five in vitro studies 
and one animal model to elucidate the role of OAT2 in explaining the effects on creatinine and uric acid 
and potential interactions with other substrates of OAT2. The NC animal study is not to be considered 
of sufficient value with regard to the translation to humans, therefore the conduction of this study is 
not recommended. The company proposed to investigate different types of OAT2 expressing in vitro 
systems (MDCK-II and liver), different endogenous and drug substrates, and time and dose dependent 
inhibition. The proposed interaction program is expected to contribute to greater understanding of any 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020  
Page 54/154 
 
 
 
potential clinical role of OAT2 inhibition by bempedoic acid in the disposition of endogenous and 
administered substrates. As the observed increases of uric acid and creatinine were mild and reversible 
within 4 weeks, it was agreed that the role of OAT2 inhibition is elucidated post registration.   
The applicant proposed to use PBPK to investigate inhibition of OAT2 and OATP1B1. Caution is 
recommended on the use of PBPK, given the acknowledged lack of data and hence uncertainties in the 
model, it should not be used in place of clinical data. However, it is accepted that a model may assist 
with the understanding of the interplay between transporters. Category 3 studies investigating OAT2 
inhibition were added to the agreed version of the RMP.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Regarding the mechanism of action for bempedoic acid it appears that bempedoic acid inhibits 
adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl 
Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway to inhibit cholesterol synthesis 
in the liver which triggers upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) expression in 
the liver thereby increasing LDL-C uptake and reducing LDL-C in the blood. This specific mechanism 
could not be formally tested in any clinical setting, only the eventual PD result in terms of LDL-C could 
be demonstrated. However, some support comes from Mendelian randomised studies showing that 
absence of ACL gene expression results in the lowering of LDL-C. The PD marker of LDL-C lipid-
lowering effect was demonstrated in several phase I studies in healthy volunteers, several phase 2 
studies in a diseased population (see also efficacy section) and confirmed in several phase 3 studies 
(as discussed in the efficacy section). Two small short-term (15 days) phase I randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study in healthy subjects tested the LDL-C lowering effect of 
bempedoic acid in a dose range of 20 mg to 220 mg in small cohorts of 6 subjects each. Dose-
dependent reduction was observed from a 60 mg QD dose or higher and started at 4 days after start of 
treatment with maximum effect achieved after 15 days at the end of the study. No consistent patterns 
could be observed for other lipid parameters including TC, HDL-C and TG. The phase 2 studies (and 
phase 3 studies) provide further support for the primary PD effect as described in the efficacy section. 
In vitro hERG data and nonclinical safety pharmacology studies indicate an absence of effect 
potential QTc prolongation. Further evaluation of a potential pro-arrhythmic effect was performed 
by a thorough QT study. A slightly higher dose than the intended to be registered dose (240 mg vs 180 
mg) was investigated and compared to the positive moxifloxacin control. No indication for a QT 
prolonging effect of bempedoic acid was observed after multiple dosing with the 240 mg dose. These 
data do not raise any need for closer QT observation during the phase 3 studies. 
The effect of PK/PD in renal impairment was studied by a PK/PD model. The PK/PD model suggests an 
absence of a significant effect of renal impairment on the bempedoic acid LDL-C lowering effect. This is 
in line with the observation in the clinical studies. 
The effect of statins on the PD treatment effect of bempedoic acid has been explored using a PK/PD 
model. The model used the data from 3 phase 3 studies (studies 040, 047 (high risk, long term pool) 
and 046). It appeared that the model slightly overestimated the LDL-C lowering effect and thus may 
not exactly fit the observed effect. Bempedoic acid has an incremental effect on LDL-C reduction when 
added onto statin therapy. In the exposure-LDL-C response modelling, the additive LDL C lowering by 
bempedoic acid decreased with increasing statin dose. This is in line with the subgroup analyses in the 
clinical studies demonstrating the lowest effect with the highest statin intensity. 
Further, one study specifically evaluated the PK and PD effect of bempedoic acid added to PCSK9 
treatment (evolocumab). Both products have a different mode of action. Bempedoic acid showed an 
additional significant LDL-C lowering effect on top of PCSK9 treatment of -30.3% after 2 months of 
Assessment report

treatment, which thus appears even slightly greater than the LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid 
monotherapy. 
As may be expected, no interaction was observed when metformin was co-administered with steady 
state bempedoic acid for lipid levels and postprandial and fasting glucose. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid have been adequately characterised.  
A pharmacokinetic interaction between bempedoic acid and statins has been observed. The impact of 
this increased exposure of statins on the increased LDL-C lowering is not exactly clear as this has not 
been clinically tested, although subgroup analyses and additional modelling of the clinical data suggest 
that the relative contribution of bempedoic acid to the overall LDL lowering effect is highest with lower 
statin doses (see clinical efficacy and clinical safety section).  
The mechanism behind the increase in ezetimibe, uric acid, and creatinine are currently not well 
established and will be further investigated post marketing as reflected in agreed RMP. 
The potential interactions of the major inactive metabolite ECT-1002-glucuronide is not exactly clear as 
its steady state concentrations are unknown. The applicant committed to measure steady-state 
concentrations of ETC-1002-glucuronide to evaluate the interaction potential of ETC-1002-glucuronide 
post-authorisation. 
The mode of action of bempedoic acid is reasonably well established. Lowering of the LDL-C has been 
demonstrated. Further, no interaction exists with PCSK9 inhibitors or metformin. There is no sign of a 
pro-arrhythmic effect. The LDL-C effect has been further explored with a PK/PD model.

A pooled analysis of 6 phase 2 studies in 832 patients (580 on bemepdoic) demonstrated a dose 
dependent effect up to 180 mg QD dose; see Table 6 below. Higher doses than the 180 mg QD dose 
did not provide an additional lipid lowering effect versus placebo. Also, on top of statins, the 180 mg 
dose provided the largest effect (-21.7%) with no additional effect with the 240 mg dose (-21.7%). Of 
note, the (additional) effect of bempedoic acid on top of statin was lower than compared to the 
bempedoic effect without statin background therapy. The effect of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe 
versus placebo showed the largest treatment effect (-45.6% BA 120 mg + 10 mg eze, -50.1% BA 180 
mg +10 mg.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Phase 3 program included 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. 
Studies 1002-040 and 1002-047 included patients treated on maximum tolerated statins and the 
substantial smaller studies 1002-046 and 1002-048 included statin-intolerant patients. The open-label 
extension study (1002 050) included patients from study 1002 040 and is still ongoing.

Phase 3 main studies  
The phase 3 main studies included two studies on top of maximum tolerated statins and two studies in 
statin intolerant patients (none or low dose statin) 
An integrated presentation of the four phase 3 studies is presented below as they present several 
common features. Individual study features will be presented where needed. 
Methods 
All phase 3 studies were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group, 
multicenter studies with bempedoic acid 180 mg per day or placebo in adult patients at risk for CV 
events with primary hyperlipidemia. 
Studies on top of maximum tolerated statins 
The largest study 040 used a 2-week screening period before randomization. Patients who met all 
enrollment criteria were instructed to continue their therapy(s) for lipid regulation and to maintain a 
consistent diet and exercise pattern throughout the study. Other lipid lowering medication was allowed 
after 24 weeks of treatment. 
In study 047 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons. A single-blind placebo run-in period was used. Patients who met all enrollment criteria 
continued their allowed stable background LMT and maintained consistent diet and exercise patterns 
throughout the study. 
Studies in statin intolerant patients 
In study 046 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons. A single-blind placebo run-in period was used. Patients who met all enrollment criteria 
continued their allowed stable background LMT and maintained consistent diet and exercise patterns 
throughout the study. 
In study 048 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons. Eligible patients began the single-blind, placebo run-in period with study-supplied and 
labelled ezetimibe and placebo 4 weeks prior to randomisation. If a patient was already taking 
ezetimibe, they stopped taking their personal supply of ezetimibe and began taking study-supplied 
ezetimibe. The effect was evaluated prior to randomization. 
Lipid sample collection  
In the Phase 3 studies, samples were collected and analyzed for basic fasting lipids (calculated LDL-C, 
HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, and TGs), apo B and hsCRP at a central clinical laboratory in each study.  
Blood draws for lipids were required to be taken after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed).  
LDL-C was calculated, or if TGs were > 400 mg/dL or LDL-C was < 50 mg/dL, LDL-C was measured 
directly. 
Data monitoring and CV events adjudication 
An unblinded independent data monitoring committee monitored accumulating patient safety and 
efficacy data until the last patient completed study treatment. A blinded independent expert Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated clinical endpoints including CV events.

CV risk definition 
High risk was defined as a diagnosis of HeFH or ASCVD (with established CHD or CHD risk 
equivalents).  Established CHD included 1 or more of either MI, silent MI, unstable angina, coronary 
revascularization procedure, or clinically significant CHD diagnosed by invasive or non-invasive testing.  
Risk of CHD included 1 or more of either peripheral arterial disease, previous ischemic stroke with a 
focal ischemic neurological deficit that persisted ≥ 24 hours.  Diagnosis of HeFH must have been made 
by either genotyping or by clinical assessment using either the World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria/Dutch Lipid Clinical Network Criteria with a score that was > 8 points or the Simon Broome 
Register Diagnostic Criteria with an assessment of Definite HeFH. 
Maximum tolerated statin therapy 
Maximally tolerated statin use needed to be at stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. 
Maximally tolerated statin included statin regimens other than daily dosing, including no to very low 
doses, with documented reasons for not using high-intensity statin dosing.  Gemfibrozil was prohibited 
in patients taking a statin.  
Statin intolerance 
Statin intolerance defined in Study 1002-046 as the inability to tolerate 2 or more statins, one at a low 
dose, due to an adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin therapy and resolved or 
improved when statin therapy was discontinued and in Study 1002-048 as the inability to tolerate 1 or 
more statins. 
Relevant other exclusion criteria 
Liver disease or dysfunction, ALT/AST ≥2 × ULN, bilirubin ≥1.2 × ULN; creatine kinase (CK) >3 × 
ULN, and within 3 months CV disease or intervention.

1 Statins were allowed at specific doses in Study 1002-046 and Study 1002-048.  In Studies 1002-046 
and 1002-048, very low-dose statin therapy was allowed defined as an average daily dose of 
rosuvastatin < 5 mg, atorvastatin < 10 mg, simvastatin < 10 mg, lovastatin < 20 mg, pravastatin 
< 40 mg, fluvastatin < 40 mg, or pitavastatin < 2 mg.  In Study 1002-048, low-dose statin therapy 
was also allowed defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, 
simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg. At 
average daily doses < 40 mg 
2 At average daily doses ≤ 40 mg prior to Amendment 5 and < 40 mg after Amendment 5. 
3 Patients who were already receiving ezetimibe were switched to study supplied ezetimibe at the time 
of the run-in period.  LDL C after the ezetimibe run-in period had to be ≥ 70 mg/dL.  
4 Gemfibrozil was excluded in patients on a statin per statin Rx.  All others allowed but required to be 
stable for at least 6 weeks prior to screening.  
5 Prohibited within 4 weeks prior to screening, but allowed as adjunctive therapy starting at Week 24. 
Statin therapy 
Baseline statin intensity (high intensity statin, moderate intensity statin, low intensity was determined 
for each patient based on the patient’s average daily dose at baseline. 
High-dose statin was defined as rosuvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg 
per day.  With the implementation of Amendment 5 in study 040, simvastatin at doses ≥ 40 mg/day, 
including simvastatin-containing therapies, was prohibited, due to a bempedoic induced increase of 
exposure of simvastatin considered to be of clinical relevance; at the time of the amendment, 98 
patients were receiving daily doses of simvastatin of ≥ 40 mg and were discontinued for this reason.  
Gemfibrozil was prohibited during the study. 
Low-dose statin was defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, 
simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg.  
Very low dose statin therapy was defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin < 5 mg,

b Low intensity statins also included those patients taking low-dose statins using an alternate regimen 
(ie, every other day, or for a specified number of times per week) and in Study 1002-047, those 
unable to tolerate a statin at any dose. 
Objectives 
Study 1002-040: To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo in 
patients with hyperlipidemia (with underlying heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] 
and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]) who were at high risk for a CV event and who 
had elevated LDL-C, despite receiving treatment with maximally-tolerated statin therapy with and 
without other LMT.  
Study 1002-047: To assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C in high CV risk patients with hyperlipidemia (with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease [ASCVD] and/or underlying heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) who are not 
adequately controlled with their maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy, defined as maximally-
tolerated statin therapy with and without other LMT. 
Study 1002-046: to assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C in patients with elevated LDL-C who are statin intolerant. 
Study 1002-048: To assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C when added to ezetimibe therapy in patients with elevated LDL-C.

Primary endpoint was safety in Study 1002-040; however, percent change from baseline to 
i 
Week 12 in LDL-C was the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Sample size 
A total of 1950 patients were planned to be enrolled in study 1002-040. The sample size was selected 
to determine the absolute risk with at least 95% power to detect adverse events that occur at rates 
similar to those seen in the placebo group for AESIs in the recently completed long-term safety study 
in the PCSK9i, alirocumab (Robinson et al, 2015). 
In study 1002-046 (n=300), study 1002-047 (n=750) and study 1002-048 (n=225), the sample size 
was determined to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference of 15% in the percent change 
from baseline to Week 12 in calculated LDL-C between the bempedoic acid treatment group and the 
placebo group. This calculation was based on a 2-sided t-test at the 5% level of significance and a 
common standard deviation of 15%. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to bempedoic acid or matching placebo using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS). For studies on top of statins, randomization was stratified by CV risk 
(whether the patient had a diagnosis of HeFH) and baseline statin intensity. 
In all studies, study medication was administered in a double-blind fashion. The Sponsor, all clinical 
site personnel (eg, investigator, pharmacist), other vendor personnel, and patients were blinded to the 
treatment group for each patient. Patients were also blinded to the treatment they received. Unblinded 
user(s) were designated for each clinical site and at the Sponsor (or designee) as needed to perform 
emergency unblinding of treatment for an individual patient e.g. in case the safety of the patient might 
have been at risk.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020

Post-randomization values for LDL-C, TGs, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, and hsCRP, including any 
plasma concentration of the bempedoic acid analyte (ETC-1002) and its metabolite (ESP15228), were 
not available to personnel from the clinical site, the patient, the Sponsor, or CRO. 
Statistical methods 
The following populations were defined for analysis purposes (Table 12): 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS), also known as the intention-to-treat set, was used for all of the efficacy 
analyses and was defined as all randomized patients. Patients in the FAS were included in their 
randomized treatment group, regardless of their actual treatment. 
• The Safety Analysis Set, used for all of the safety summaries, was defined as all randomized patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Patients in the Safety Analysis Set were included in 
the treatment group that they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment. 
• The PK analysis set included all patients in the Safety Analysis Set who had at least one PK 
assessment. These patients were included in plasma concentration summaries unless major protocol 
deviations identified during the protocol deviation review or if key dosing or sampling information was 
missing. 
• In studies 046 and 048, a completer Analysis Set, used as a sensitivity analysis for the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses, was defined as all patients in the FAS who completed both IMP and 
ezetimibe treatment per the end of treatment CRF page and had non-missing Week 12 LDL-C values.

Study 048: 269 patients enrolled and randomized, 268 patients treated.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy reduction from baseline in LDL-C at week 12 for 
bempedoic acid compared with placebo was -15.1% vs 2.4%, respectively, in Study 1002-047 
and -16.5% vs -1.6%, respectively, in Study 1002-040.   
In the statin intolerant studies, the reduction from baseline in LDL-C for bempedoic acid versus placebo 
was -22.6% vs -1.2%, respectively in Study 1002-046 and –23.5% vs 5.0%, respectively in 
Study 1002-048.   
Secondary endpoints 
For LDL-C at Week 24, the difference between bempedoic acid and placebo was -14.8% for 
Study 1002-047, -16.1% for Study 1002-040, and -18.9% for Study 1002-046. 
For non-HDL-C at week 12, this was -13.0% for Study 1002-047, -13.3% for Study 1002-040, -17.9% 
for Study 1002-046, and -23.6% in Study 1002-048. 
For TC at week 12, this was -11.2% for Study 1002-047, -11.1% for Study 1002-040, and -14.8% for 
Study 1002-046, and -15.1% in Study 1002-048. 
For Apo B at week 12, this was -13.0% for Study 1002-047, -11.9% for Study 1002-040, and -15.0% 
for Study 1002-046, and -19.3% in Study 1002-048. 
For hsCRP at week 12, median percent change from baseline was -18.7% and -9.4% for 
Study 1002-047, -22.4% and 2.6% for Study 1002-040, -25.4% and 2.7% for Study 1002-046, and -
32.5 and 2.1% in Study 1002-048.

(Full Analysis Set) 
Changes were made to the background therapy after week 24 as indicated below. Background LLT 
therapy was slightly less intensified the bempedoic acid treatment arm than in the placebo arm (8.8% 
vs 10.1%; n= 278). This was mainly adjunctive therapy of statins (7.0% vs 8.0%), while evolocumab 
and alirocumab use was very limited (5 (0.2%) vs 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.4%) vs 1 (0.1%)).

Table 20. :  Summary of Patients with Changes in Concomitant Lipid-modifying Therapy after 
First Dose of IMP in Pool 1, High Risk/Long-term Pool by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
Class and Preferred Term (Safety Population) 
Phase 3 open label ongoing extension study (study 1002-050) 
In the ongoing phase 3 open label study 050 the results are displayed in Table 21 below (as of 
28 September 2018). Efficacy was assessed as a secondary objective.  Patients who received either 
bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo daily for the duration of Study 1002-040 receive bempedoic acid 
180 mg daily in the OLE Study 1002-050 for 78 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period off study 
drug.  For patients randomized to bempedoic acid 180 mg in the parent study 1002-040, total patient 
exposures from the combined treatment in Study 1002-040 and Study 1002-050 are up to 2.5 years. 
To maintain the integrity of the parent study, which was ongoing at the time enrollment into 
Study 1002-050 began, investigators, site staff, patients, and the study team were masked to study 
lipid levels until the Week 12 study visit, after which time lipid values were made available to sites. 
Visit occur at every 3 months.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In addition to the results presented above, the following data are also available. 
High risk/Long term pool (on top of statins) 
Treatment with bempedoic acid resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 
compared with placebo of -16.7% (SD 20.9) versus 1.8% (23.5), respectively. The difference 
was -17.8, with 95% CI -19.5, -16.0, (p < 0.001). 
Treatment goals 
Higher percentages of patients in the bempedoic acid group achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (26.2% to 
28.9%) compared with patients in the placebo group (8.0% to 9.3%) at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 in the 
studies on top of statins (see Table 26).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Statin intolerance 
Two placebo-controlled studies (046 and 048) were performed to investigate and confirm the LDL-C 
lipid lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients. Patients with high CV 
risk eligible for further lipid lowering therapy based on their LDL-C level were included.   
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group studies 
should allow for the primary objective of an adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid treatment 
effect on LDL-C reduction. The studies were limited in duration with respectively 24 and 12 weeks of 
treatment and included a relatively limited number of patients. In study 048 no PCSK9 inhibitors were 
allowed, limiting interpretation in terms of reflecting clinical practice options in lipid lowering 
treatment. A 2:1 randomisation is acceptable to optimise exposure to the investigational product. The 
primary endpoint of LDL-C lowering was assessed at 12 weeks, which is sufficiently long to establish 
the maximum stable LDL-C treatment effect. The secondary endpoints of the Week 24 percentage LDL-
C reduction (as evaluated in study 046) can be supportive for the primary endpoint and is acceptable. 
Other parameters of the lipid profile (nonHDL-C, TC, apoB) were evaluated as secondary endpoints, 
which is considered relevant and supported. The relevance of evaluation of hsCRP as the secondary 
endpoint is considered of less importance as the clinical implication is less clear. A 4-week run-in 
period is relatively short but acceptable to stabilise for background diet/exercise and LLT therapy. 
Specific stabilisation periods have been included for fibrates (6 weeks) and PCSK9 inhibitors (at least 3 
injections), which is appropriate. To establish baseline LDL-C levels in phase 3 studies based on week -
1 and 0 is appropriate.  
Identification of patients eligible for lipid lowering therapy was based on the combination of CV 
risk classification and LDL-C level. In study 046, LDL-C had to be ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at baseline. 
Although that for study 048 inclusion was only based on LDL-C level LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at 
baseline without any CV risk level requirement, post-hoc analyses demonstrate that these patients 
satisfy to lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) treatment criteria. 
Whether the population could be defined as a population with hypercholesterolemia as proposed in 
the requested indication, screening criteria before entering the run-in phase of the studies needs to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020 
Page 96/154 
 
 
  
 
considered. For studies 046 and 048 the screening inclusion criteria were meeting the definition of 
hypercholesterolemia. At screening, this was an LDL-C level of ≥ 130 mg/dL in primary prevention 
patients and ≥ 100 mg/dL in secondary prevention while in study 046, and ≥ 100 mg/dL in patients 
taking ezetimibe and ≥ 120 mg/dL in patients not taking ezetimibe in study 048. 
Definition of statin intolerance for study 046 was defined as an inability to tolerate 2 or more 
statins, one at a low dose, due to an adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin 
therapy and resolved or improved when statin therapy was discontinued. In this respect, to consider 
patient statin intolerant who are treated with lower than the defined very-low dose can be acceptable. 
Whether patients in study 048 would be statin intolerant based on the inclusion criteria is less clear. 
Patients had to have attempted one statin treatment and were being unable to tolerate it due to an 
adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin therapy and resolved or improved when 
statin therapy was discontinued or the dose lowered. The exclusion criteria are generally acceptable to 
optimize study adherence and reduce potential dropouts, comply with inclusion criteria, reduce 
potential tolerability issues with background medication, and exclude any possible relevant 
confounding. 
Lipid sample collection by a centralised laboratory is appropriate and according to current study 
standards. Sample sizes were calculated to provide 95% power to observe a difference of 15% on the 
percent change from baseline in LDL-C, which is considered clinically relevant. The statistical analysis 
plans for the studies were considered acceptable. 
On top of statins 
Two placebo-controlled studies (047 and 040) were performed to investigate and confirm the LDL-C 
lipid lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid. In these studies the effect was evaluated on top of 
maximum tolerated statin therapy with other lipid lowering therapy. Patients with high CV risk eligible 
for further lipid lowering therapy based on their LDL-C level were included. The larger study 040 was 
limited in the sense that no PCSK9 inhibitors treatment was allowed as background therapy in contrast 
to the considerable smaller study 047, including comparable study patients and with comparable study 
evaluation period (52 weeks). Overall, these studies potentially allow for a short- and intermediate 
term evaluation of the lipid lowering effect of bempedoic acid in patients eligible for lipid lowering 
therapy according to current guideline standards. An open-label long-term study which is currently 
ongoing should provide additional data on the maintenance of effect beyond one year of therapy. 
Although, data will be limited as the study is currently ongoing. 
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group studies  
should allow for the primary objective of an adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid treatment 
effect on LDL-C reduction either on top of lipid lowering therapy including maximum tolerated statin 
therapy or in patients who are statin intolerant. A 2:1 randomisation is acceptable to optimise 
exposure to the investigational product. The primary endpoint of LDL-C lowering was assessed at 12 
weeks, which is sufficiently long to establish the maximum stable LDL-C treatment effect. The 52 
weeks treatment period should support for longer maintenance of effect. However, it was not fully 
understood why the largest 040 study is primarily designed as a safety study, although the efficacy 
was evaluated in a comparable method as the other studies. The secondary endpoints of the Week 24 
percentage LDL-C reduction can be supportive for the primary endpoint and is acceptable. Other 
parameters of the lipid profile (nonHDL-C, TC, apoB) were evaluated as secondary endpoints, which is 
considered relevant and supported. The specific 2-week run-in for the largest 040 study is very short 
to exclude any possible confounding of background therapy on the efficacy treatment evaluation, 
however, patients needed already be on stable therapy prior to this run-in phase. To establish baseline 
LDL-C levels in phase 3 studies based on week -1 and 0 is appropriate. Adjunctive LMT could be

initiated after 24 weeks in both 52 weeks studies per investigator discretion if protocol-defined LDL-C 
threshold criteria were met, which is acceptable and would not favour any study treatment outcomes.  
Identification of patients eligible for lipid lowering therapy was appropriately based on the combination 
of CV risk classification and LDL-C level, and in accord with treatment guidelines of learned societies 
(ESC, AHA). Patients were included based on LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL at Week -2 (study 040) or baseline 
(study 047) and high CV risk (diagnosis of HeFH or ASCVD [established CHD or CHD risk equivalent]).  
Whether the population could be defined as a population with hypercholesterolemia as proposed in the 
requested indication, screening criteria before entering the run-in phase of the studies needs to be 
considered.  For study 047, the screening inclusion criteria were meeting the definition of 
hypercholesterolemia. At screening, this was a LDL-C level of ≥ 100 mg/dL. However, for study 040 in 
patients on stable maximum tolerated statin dose, LDL-C had to be ≥ 70 mg/dL at Screening (Week -
2), which is not necessarily hypercholesterolemia, but these patients would likely had 
hypercholesterolemia at start of statin therapy in the past (start of therapy unknown). The exclusion 
criteria are generally acceptable to optimize study adherence and reduce potential dropouts, comply 
with inclusion criteria, reduce potential tolerability issues with background medication, and exclude any 
possible relevant confounding. 
Lipid sample collection by a centralised laboratory and data monitoring and CV events adjudication by 
independent committees is appropriate and according to current study standards. 
Sample sizes were calculated to provide 95% power to observe a difference of 15% on the percent 
change from baseline in LDL-C, which is considered clinically relevant. The statistical analysis plans for 
the studies are considered acceptable. 
Phase 2 studies 
Several phase 2 studies were performed to evaluate the lipid lowering effect of bemepdoic acid either 
as monotherapy (1) including dose finding studies (3), concomitantly with other lipid lowering therapy 
of atorvastatin (1) and atorvastatin+ezetimibe (1), and on top of statin therapy with one being a dose 
finding study (3) or PCSK9 therapy (1). Study treatment including other LLT of atorvastatin and/or 
ezetimibe was controlled by a washout period of LLT prior to evaluation in the studies. Almost all 
studies used LDL-C lowering as the primary endpoint with evaluation after 4 weeks to 12 weeks. Only 
study 007 (study on top of statins) was a safety study but LDL-C lowering efficacy was evaluated after 
8 weeks of treatment. These studies allow for a first evaluation of the treatment effect of bempedoic 
acid either alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapies and to identify the optimal dose 
for the phase 3 confirmatory phase. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase 2 studies 
Four dose finding phase 2 studies were performed in hyperlipidemic patients with either normal or 
elevated TGs designed as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 studies. These studies 
included 177 with hyperlipidemia, 56 (statin-intolerant), 349 (with or without statin intolerance) and 
134 patients (stable statin dose), respectively.  
An LDL-C lowering effect was observed in the range of 40 to 120 mg bempedoic acid dose after 12 
weeks (-15.7%, -22.9%, and -24.5%; p<0.001), 60 mg uptitrated to 120 mg and 180 mg uptitrated 
to 240 mg (each dose 2 weeks) ((60 mg, -18.0%; 120 mg, -30.0%; 180 mg, -28.8%, 240 mg -
28.5%). In another study, the LS mean difference from ezetimibe monotherapy for percent change in 
LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -6.5% for bempedoic acid 120 mg (p = 0.0008), -8.91% for 
Assessment report

Page 98/154 
 
 
  
bempedoic acid 180 mg (p <0.0001), -21.86% for bempedoic acid 120 mg + ezetimibe (p <0.0001), 
and -26.5% for bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe (p <0.0001). In a study of 120 and 180 mg 
bempedoic acid on top of statins after 12 weeks, the LS mean relative to placebo was -13.1% 
(p = 0.0055), and -20.1% (p <0.0001), respectively.  
A pooled analysis of 6 phase 2 studies in 832 patients (580 on BA) also demonstrated a dose 
dependent effect up to 180 mg QD dose; placebo adjusted LDL-C: -18.3%, -25.5%, -29.8%, -32.4%, 
and -28.8% with bempedoic acid 60, 80, 120, 180, and 240 mg QD, respectively. Higher doses than 
the 180 mg QD dose did not provide an additional lipid lowering effect versus placebo. Also, on top of 
statins, the 180 provided the largest effect (-21.7%) with no additional effect with the 240 mg dose (-
21.7%). The (additional) effect of bempedoic acid on top of statin was lower than compared to the 
bempedoic effect versus placebo. The effect of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe obviously showed the 
largest treatment effect (-45.6% BA 120 mg + 10 mg eze, -50.1% BA 180 mg +10 mg eze). Overall, 
these data reasonably support the choice for the 180 mg QD dose as evaluated in the phase 3 studies. 
Statin intolerance  
A limited number of patients (345 in study 046 and 269 patients in study 048) were included. In these 
studies a large proportion of patients completed the study and this was comparable for bempedoic acid 
(94-97%) versus placebo (92-96%). Main reasons for discontinuations of treatment were adverse 
event. The lowest discontinuation of study treatment was found in the 048 statin intolerant patients 
(9.4% vs 9.1%), which could likely partly explained by the shorter follow up. For the longer follow-up 
046 study in statin intolerant patients, discontinuation of study medication was substantially higher 
(24.8% vs 16.2%). Adverse events were the main cause of study drug discontinuation (18.4% vs 
11.7% in study 046 and 7.2% vs 5.7% in study 048). Other reasons that contributed most but in 
variable proportion across the different studies were patients withdrawals, patient decision and sponsor 
decision. 
All studies represent a study population of primarily Caucasians at high or very high CV risk and at 
relative increased age (mean 64 to 65 years of age; Caucasian 85% to 91%). CV risk estimation was 
distributed across patients with ASCVD (39-40%) and patients at increased CV risk based on CV risk 
factors including e.g. hypertension (58-68%), diabetes (19-27%) and (history of) smoking 
(approximately 40%). The 046 study in statin intolerant patients was only performed in US and 
Canada, and thus may be less representative for the EU situation, although these patients would also 
be eligible for LMT according to the EU criteria.  In these studies, 8-10% in study 046 used statins, and 
in study 048 28-33% used statins with most patients below low dose and some at a low dose. Further, 
these studies largely present a hypercholesterolemic patient population as baseline mean LDL-C level 
ranged from 123.0 (27.20) to 158.5 (40.39) mg/dL (3.18 – 4.1 mmol/L). Screening levels also 
represent those of a hypercholesterolemic population. 
Randomisation was successful, with only slight differences between treatment groups for almost all 
patient characteristics. Efficacy analysis based on the FAS is an acceptable approach. 
A significant reduction (p<0.001) on the primary endpoint of percent LDL-C reduction after 12 weeks 
of treatment was observed with -21.4% (95%CI -25.1, -17.7%) and -28.5% (95%CI -34.4, -22.5%) 
for study 046 and 048, respectively. The effect on LDL-C reduction was slightly diminished during 24 
weeks in study 046 (-18.9%; p<0.001). The primary LDL-C lowering effect was supported by 
secondary analysis demonstrating significant reductions for other lipid parameters including non-HDL-
C, TC, and apoB (p<0.001) after 12 weeks of treatment. Some significant percent reduction was also 
observed in the hsCRP level, being assessed as a secondary endpoint. Results on the proportion of 
patients achieving hsCRP levels of < 2 mg/L showed that more patients met this criterion in the statin 
intolerant pool (43.3% vs 16.7% at week 12, p<0.001). However, the clinical meaning of these results 
is unclear. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020

Comparable results across many of the subgroups were noticed for the treatment effect of bempedoic 
acid after 12 weeks. However, differences in effect on LDL-C were noticed for some subgroups 
including non-Hispanic vs Hispanic (ethnicity; <0.001), diabetes (0.032) and statin use (0.032). Also, 
the effect was larger when ezetimibe was present compared to no ezetimibe use. This effect is mainly 
driven by the difference in effect on LDL-C between study 046 and 048. Because in study 048 all 
patients used ezetimibe while in study 046 approximately 14% used ezetimibe and the overall LDL-C 
effect in study 048 was larger. Furthermore, for the age subgroups of age categories of < 65, 65 to 75 
and ≥ 75 and <85 and  ≥ 85 years no substantial differences or trends for the difference in effect was 
noticed, although the number of patients in the ≥ 85 years of age group was very limited.  
On top of statins 
For the phase 3 studies on top of maximum tolerated statin therapy, a large number of patients were 
included with 2230 patient in the largest 040 study, and 779 patients in the 047 study. A large 
proportion of patients completed the study, this was comparable for bempedoic acid (93-94%) versus 
placebo (95-97%). Main reasons for discontinuations of treatment were adverse events and withdrawal 
by the patient. Discontinuation of study treatment was higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo 
(20.5%-23.2% vs 16.7-19.1%). Adverse events were a main cause of study drug discontinuation 
(10.3-10.8% vs 7.4-8.2%). Other reasons that contributed most but in variable proportion across the 
different studies were patients withdrawals, patient decision and sponsor decision. 
Several amendments were made in these studies. Most of these amendments likely have a low impact 
on the overall results, while sensitivity analyses were proposed to check on the consequences of these 
amendments. Increase of sample size to increase the overall numbers to further support the safety 
assessment is acceptable. Amendment 5 in study 040 and amendment 3 in study 047 were relevant 
(considering the non-allowance of doses of simvastatin of 40 mg or higher). Those patients treated 
with a 40 mg dose (n=98) have discontinued in study 040. This amendment was introduced as a 
significant increase in simvastatin exposure was observed that was induced by bempedoic acid. 
Currently in the labelling it is proposed to limit the simvastatin dose to 20 mg in general and 40 mg for 
high risk patients prior to introducing bempedoic acid therapy (see further safety discussion).  
All studies represent a study population of primarily Caucasians at high or very high CV risk and at 
relatively increased age (mean age range 64 to 67 years; Caucasian 94% to 97%). In these studies, 
50-53% were on high intensity statin, and 31-43% on medium intensity statin. Very high CV risk was 
mainly identified based on the presence of ASVCD (93-95%) while few patients with HeFH were 
included (5-6%). Also, these studies were largely performed within Europe (66-72%) and thus are 
representative for the EU situation. In these studies, high intensity statins of atorvastatin (55-67%,) 
and rosuvastatin (17-33%) were used most, especially the 40 mg dose of atorvastatin (29%). 
Although PCSK9 inhibitors were allowed in study 047, there use was minimal (0.2-0.4%), which could 
be due to the timing of the studies, when CV outcome was not yet available. The studies largely 
include a hypercholesterolemic patient population as baseline mean LDL-C level ranged from 102.3 
(30.05) mg/dL (2.63 mmol/L) to 122.4 (38.30) mg/dL (3.15 mmol/L) as a result of the specific 
inclusion criteria for these trials. LDL-C at screening also indicate that patients were well above the 2.6 
mmol/L threshold to consider them to be hypercholesterolemic. 
Randomisation was successful, with only slight differences between treatment groups for almost all 
patient characteristics. Efficacy analysis based on the FAS is an acceptable approach. 
A significant reduction (p<0.001) on the primary endpoint of percent LDL-C reduction after 12 weeks 
of treatment was observed. This reduction was clinically relevant with -18.1% (95%CI -20.0, -16.1%) 
and -17.4% (95%CI -20.9, -13.8%) for the 040 and 047 studies, respectively, although this was lower 
than for the statin intolerant study pool. The relative lower effect in patients on background maximum 
tolerated statin therapy may partly be explained by the lower LDL-C baseline levels (more optimally 
Assessment report

Page 100/154 
 
 
  
treated) than the statin intolerant studies. However, the net effect is also the sum of the likely 
diminished PD effect due to inhibition in the similar pathway of bempedoic acid and statins, and the 
likely increased PD effect of bempedoic acid induced increased exposure of statins. The effect on LDL-C 
reduction was maintained during 24 weeks in the studies 040 and 047 on top of statins (-19.5%, -
18.2%, respectively; p<0.001). The LDL-C lowering treatment effect resulted in significantly more 
patients meeting the LDL-C < 70 mg/dL goal (28.9% vs 8.0% at week 12 and 26.2% vs 9.1% at week 
52). The primary LDL-C lowering effect was supported by secondary analysis demonstrating significant 
reductions for other lipid parameters including non-HDL-C, TC, and apoB (p<0.001) after 12 weeks of 
treatment.  
These primary and secondary evaluations were supported by additional analyses on the maintenance 
of effect and effects according to subgroups. In the studies with maximum tolerated statin background 
therapy (study 040, 047) the LDL-C lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid was maintained, 
although slightly diminished up to 52 weeks (-13.6% and -12.3%, respectively). The slightly 
diminished effect could have been partly caused by the allowance of change of the background therapy 
(9.2% of the patients) after 24 weeks. More specifically, background LLT therapy was slightly less 
intensified in the bempedoic acid treatment arm than in the placebo arm (8.8% vs 10.1%; n= 278). 
This was mainly adjunctive therapy of statins (7.0% vs 8.0%), while evolocumab and alirocumab use 
was very limited (5 (0.2%) vs 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.4%) vs 1 (0.1%)) and the latter may likely not have 
significantly contributed to the diminished effect. Of notice, the addition of statin therapy could be of 
interest to substantiate the additional effect of statin in combination with bempedoic acid to provide 
some support for the current dose recommendation for statins in the labelling; these data have 
currently however not been presented.  Further support for the maintenance of effect is provided in the 
ongoing open-label extension study where the LDL-C lowering effect after one year (2 years in total) 
was -16.8% (23.4%) in the former placebo patients (n = 131) and -15.8% (24.6%) in the former 
bempedoic acid patients from study 040 (n = 288)). 
Further, comparable results across many of the subgroups were noticed for the treatment effect of 
bempedoic acid after 12 weeks. However, differences were noticed for some subgroups: the effect was 
increased for female vs male (gender; p interaction 0.044), different for BMI categories (0.007), and 
lower with increased statin intensity (0.060). A difference was also noted with background ezetimibe 
therapy (lower with ezetimibe), however, p for interaction was apparently not significant. Differences 
in exposure between male and female may have contributed to the different treatment effect. For 
background, statin intensity findings may comply with what can be expected. In line with the phase 2 
studies, the treatment effect appears less in case of (increased intensity) statin use compared to less 
or no statin use at baseline. Moreover, this complies with PK/PD modelling data demonstrating statin 
intensity to be a significant factor for LDL-C reduction. In the studies with background statin therapy, 
no obvious differences in effect were observed between the individual different statins. Furthermore, 
for the age subgroups of age categories of < 65, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 and <85 and ≥ 85 years no 
substantial differences or trends for the difference in effect was noticed, although the number of 
patients in the ≥ 85 years of age group was very limited. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated the capacity to lower the LDL-C, although this effect was only 
moderate and declined with the highest doses of background statin therapy. In the absence of 
background statin therapy the effect of bempedoic acid on LDL-C reduction was larger than with statin 
background therapy. Further, a larger LDL-C lowering effect was observed in females as compared to 
male subjects. The long-term reduction of the LDL-C appeared to slightly diminish, although 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020 
Page 101/154 
 
 
  
background therapy may have played a role. Bempedoic acid induced increase in statin exposure that 
was of relevance and this significant interaction was appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the bempedoic acid clinical program, 3627 subjects/patients received bempedoic acid, including 383 
healthy subjects, 34 otherwise healthy subjects with hepatic or renal impairment, and 3210 patients 
with hyperlipidemia.  In addition, 1628 subjects/patients participated in clinical studies and did not 
receive bempedoic acid but received placebo and/or other investigational medicinal product. 
In the studies on top of statins (high risk pool) mean days of exposure to IMP was similar between the 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups (308.9 days and 322.4 days, respectively).  Median days of IMP 
exposure was the same for both placebo and bempedoic acid groups (364.0 days).  
In the statin intolerant studies, mean days of exposure to IMP was similar between the bempedoic acid 
and placebo groups (117.8 days and 122.4 days, respectively).  Median days of IMP exposure was 
lower for the bempedoic acid group (91.0 days) compared with the placebo group (112.0 days). 
In the ongoing extension Study 1002-050 includes 1462 patients, mean exposure to IMP as of 28 
September 2018 was 318.3 days.

In the ongoing open label study, a total of 934 patients overall (63.9%) had an adverse event, 
13.5% of patients had serious adverse events, 9.3% had adverse events considered related to IMP, 
and 4.1% had adverse events leading to IMP discontinuation. Most adverse events were mild or 
moderate. Six patients (0.4%) had fatal treatment-emergent adverse events during the study. 
The most common adverse events by system organ class (SOC) are mentioned in Table 32. 
Infection and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal 
disorders were the SOCs with highest frequencies.

Treatment related adverse events were 24.5% for bempedoic acid and 21.5% for placebo in the 
studies on top of statins (Table 33). The most common treatment related adverse events were myalgia 
(3.1% , 3.7%), muscle spasm (2.2%, 1.3%), diarrhea (1.3%, 1.1%) and headache (1.3%, 1.7%). For 
the statin intolerant studies this was 21.7% vs 14.1% and the most common treatment related 
adverse events were myalgia (3.0% , 3.8%), muscle spasm (2.3%, 1.7%), headache (1.3%, 1.5%), 
blood uric acid increased (1.2%, 0.2%), diarrhea (1.2%, 0.9%), and dizziness (1.1%, 1.1%).   
The most common treatment related adverse events by system organ class (SOC) and for adverse 
events of specific interest are mentioned in the table below. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders and gastrointestinal disorders were the SOCs with highest frequencies and higher for 
bempedoic acid than the comparator group.

•  New onset diabetes/hyperglycemia 
Based on experience with statins drugs, new onset diabetes/hypoglycemia was analyzed as an adverse 
event of special interest, see tables Table 34 and Table 35  below.  This was reported to be 7.1% for 
bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and 3.1% vs 4.7% in 
patients without diabetes in the studies on top of statins. This was reported to be 5.1% for bempedoic 
acid vs 9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and 1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without 
diabetes in the statin intolerant pool.

•  Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Liver abnormalities were higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo with 2.8% vs 1.3% overall, 2.5% 
vs 1.5% on top of statins, and 3.9% vs 0 in statin-intolerance, mainly due to AST/ALT increases with 
more increased of > 3 x ULN, but no cases of potential Hy’s law.

No difference in hepatobiliary disorders (SOC) was observed in each pool between both treatment 
arms (2.0% each and 0.5% each in both pools, respectively). 
•  Muscular Disorders 
Because statins are associated with muscle-related adverse effects, muscular disorders were evaluated 
as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical studies based on a prespecified list of preferred terms and associated 
changes in CK. Muscular disorders were higher for bempedoic acid vs placebo on top of statins (13.2% 
vs 10.2%). The highest frequency and largest difference in the SOC term musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (Table 38) was observed in low intensity statins (37.6% vs 23.7%). No 
difference was found for muscular disorders in statin intolerance (11.3% vs 11.6%), see Table 37.

Myositis was reported in 3 patients (0.1%) in Study 1002-040.  One serious adverse event in a patient 
receiving bempedoic acid on a background of 40 mg simvastatin (CK levels were > 10 × ULN ) 
resolved after discontinuation of IMP.  One in a patient receiving 20 mg atorvastatin and one in a 
patient receiving 80 mg atorvastatin were moderate with peak elevations in CK levels were < 3 × ULN 
in these 2 patients. These patients completed the study.

A consistent slight increase in skeletal muscle adverse events is observed for atorvastatin (25.5% 
(287) vs 23.6% (127) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissues; 13.3% vs 9.8% Any Muscular 
Disorders ), rosuvastatin (22.5% (87) vs 21.1% (45); 12.4% vs 8.0%), simvastatin (25.8% (70) vs 
23.7% (32); 12.2% vs 7.4%), and  pravastatin (30.7% (35) vs 21.5% (14); 17.5% vs 15.4%), while 
a lower rate in the BA group was observed for the other statins (n=75). For the largest subgroups the 
increase was seen in atorvastatin 40 mg dose (24.8% (148) vs 19.9% (56); 12.9 (77) vs 7.1% (20)) 
and somewhat in the rosuvastatin 20 mg dose (22.4% (39) vs 23.4% (22); 12.0% (21) vs 7.4 (7)), 
while no increase was seen in the simvastatin 20 mg dose (24.5% (38) vs 31.4% (27); 10.3% (16) vs 
10.5% (9)). For the highest doses only an increase in simvastatin 40 mg dose was observed (22.0% 
(18) vs 5.9% (2); 11.0% (9) vs 2.9% (1)), while no such increase was seen for atorvastatin 80 mg 
(28.1% (47) vs 34.1% (28); 14.4% (24) vs 14.6% (12)) or rosuvastatin 40 mg (16.0% (13) vs 15.4% 
(8); 6.2% (5) vs 5.8% (3)), although these data are limited (Table 40).

In study 048, adverse events related to muscular safety events occurred in 6.1% of patients in the 
bempedoic acid group, compared with 5.7% in the placebo group. In study 1002-048, Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders were 4 (6.8%) and 1 (4.2%) for bempedoic acid and for placebo in 
patients treated with statins background therapy, and 15 (12.3%) vs 8 (12.7%) for patients on other 
lipid lowering background therapy. 
•  Neurocognitive disorders 
Based on a possible association between statins and cognitive impairment, neurocognitive disorders 
were evaluated as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical studies using a prespecified list of preferred terms. There 
have been anecdotal reports of cognitive impairment linked to statin use.  However, a meta-analysis of 
statin clinical studies did not demonstrate an increased incidence of cognitive impairment. In the phase 
3 studies comparable low frequencies were observed between treatment arms (0.7% vs 0.8%), Table

Based on nonclinical findings and minimal mean increases in creatinine reported in Phase 1 and Phase 
2 studies, renal disorders were assessed as an AESI in Phase 3 studies, based on a prespecified list of 
adverse event preferred terms and associated laboratory parameters.

Renal disorders were higher for bempedoic acid versus placebo (2.8% vs 1.3%), with difference in 
renal failure (0.8% vs 0.2%), renal impairment (0.5% vs 0.3%), and blood creatinine increased (0.8% 
vs 0.3%), Table 43.

•  Uric acid increases/gout 
Based on increases in mean serum uric acid levels observed in patients who received bempedoic acid 
in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, uric acid increases were evaluated as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical 
studies based on a prespecified list of preferred terms and associated changes in serum uric acid 
levels. More blood uric acid increased, hyperuricemia and gout were found for bempedoic acid (see 
Table 44).

Because of mean decreases in hemoglobin observed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, hemoglobin 
decreases were evaluated based on a prespecified list of adverse event preferred terms and changes in 
laboratory measures of hemoglobin. More events of decreased hemoglobin and anemia were found for 
bempedoic acid, see Table 45.

The imbalance in fatal events (safety set) was 19 (0.9%) vs 4 (0.4%) and all occurred within the high-
risk pool (on top of statins). Fourteen bempedoic acid and 4 placebo patients had treatment-emergent 
deaths within 30 days of the last dose of IMP and were adjudicated by a CEC; these deaths were 
adjudicated as CV deaths (10 bempedoic acid, 3 placebo) or non-CV deaths (4 bempedoic acid, 1 
placebo), see MACE events table below; 5 remaining death events (all bempedoic acid) were part of 
the safety population (non-CEC adjudicated) as they were outside the 30 days treatment –emergent 
time frame (but started within this time frame).  
Adjudicated CV deaths (10 vs 3) could be explained by the cardiac disorder SOC in study 040 (5 
(0.3%) vs 0) and study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 (0.8%)), ischaemic cerebral infarction (1 vs 0) and death 
(with unknown origin) (1 vs 1).

Imbalance in neoplasm SOC were only observed in study 040 (5 (0.3%) vs 0). Of these, 4 cases were 
adjudicated as non-CV death (see MACE events table). Three out of five events occurred within 90 
days of study period. 
Fatality rate was substantially higher in the placebo controlled pool in comparison to the open-label 
extension phase; For the placebo controlled pool this was 0.9 per 100 person-years based on a mean 
exposure of 306 days in 1487 patients for bempedoic acid and was 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 
placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days. This was 0.5 patients per 100 person-years 
with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the open-label study 050 (second 
interim analysis of Study 1002-050 (15 March 2019)). 
In study 050, fatal events were 1 each for myocardial infarction, accidental death, brain death, death, 
b-cell lymphoma, metastatic gastric cancer, fall, haemorrhagic intracranial), with 8 of 9 events not 
considered related to study drug and patients suffered from multiple risk factors that could have 
contributed to the fatal event. 
MACE events 
The number of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events and analyses on hazard ratios are 
provided below in Table 48 and Table 49, and were lower for bempedoic acid (5.0% vs 5.7%).

All 9 patients in the statin intolerant pool with MACE were from Study 1002-046 and had a history of 
ASCVD. Seven of the 9 patients had coronary revascularization, 5 of whom had unstable angina and 1 
had a nonfatal myocardial infarction; the remaining 2 patients had a non-fatal stroke.

No immunological events are reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See discussion on concomitant use with statins. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Overall Phase 3 Pool, the most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug 
are provided below in Table 56. Also, most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation 
according to SOC are provided, differentiated for the studies on top of statins and studies in statin 
intolerant patients. More patients on bempedoic acid discontinued due to an AE (11.3% vs 7.8%), 
mostly due to GI disorders (1.5% vs 0.7%) or musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.8% 
vs 1.9%) on top of statins, Table 57.

In the open-label extension Study 1002-050, adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug 
occurred in 4.1% of patients. The most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation were 
myalgia, dizziness, and headache, each of which led to discontinuation in 3 patients (0.3%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Statin intolerance 
In the statin-intolerant pool a limited number of 613 were included. In the statin intolerant pool of 
studies 046 (lipid lowering therapy and no or lower than lowest approved dose of statins) and 048 (no 
or low dose statins and study medication of ezetimibe) the median exposure was limited to 91 and 112 
days for study treatment and placebo, due to the shorter follow-up period (24 weeks and 12 weeks, 
respectively).  
TEAEs were slightly higher for bempedoic acid compared to placebo (57.3% vs 51.5%) as well as for 
serious AEs (4.6% vs 3.5%, respectively) and treatment related Aes (21.7% vs 14.1%).  
Adverse events were mostly reported in the infection and infestations (15.2% vs 19.2%), and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (17.1% vs 18.7%) categories. The most frequent 
adverse events were urinary tract infections (3.1% vs 7.1%), myalgia (3.4% s 5.1%), and arthralgia 
(4.1% vs 2.5%).  
The frequency of serious Aes was slightly higher (4.6% vs 3.5%). However, these were without 
substantial differences (<0.5% and without meaningful absolute differences in numbers) or any 
notable pattern. Therefore, these data do not allow for any meaningful conclusions. Cardiovascular 
events and deaths are of major interest (see also below in on top of statin discussion). MACE events 
were very rarely observed but higher for bempedoic acid (9 vs 0). This was mainly attributed to 
coronary revascularisation. All patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. Any fatal events were not observed in 
the statin intolerant study pool, which is reassuring.  
Specific attention has been given to reporting on known adverse events from treatment with 
statins including new-onset diabetes/hypoglycaemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, muscular disorders, 
and neurocognitive disorders as discussed below. Further, specific attention was also given to some 
other Aes due to non-clinical findings and findings observed in phase 1 and 2 studies including 
hypoglycaemia (and associated metabolic acidosis), renal disorders, uric acid increases/gout, and 
decreased haemoglobin. 
Although based on limited numbers, there is no sign that treatment with bempedoic acid would 
increase diabetes risk. Worsening of hyperglycemia was reported to be 5.1% for bempedoic acid vs 
9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and new-onset diabetes was reported to be 
1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Further support for an absence of an effect on 
diabetes with bempedoic acid comes from data on the changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose, which 
showed no risk of increase or shifts in these parameters for bempedoic acid. Mean change was in HbA1c 
was -0.03% vs 0.20%. No shifts from ≤ 5.5% to ≥ 6.5% were observed and shifts from 5.5%-6.4% to 
≥ 6.5% were lower in bempedoic acid (5.4% vs 11.3%), although shifts from ≤ 5.5% to 5.5%-6.4% 
were higher (6.3% vs 1.9%) based on limited numbers.  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (16 (3.9%) vs 0), with AST increased (4 (1.0%) vs 0) and ALT increased 
(4 (1.0% vs 0) being higher. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurred in 5 (1.2%) vs 0, while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed.  
Muscular disorders were observed at a comparable frequency between bempedoic acid and placebo 
(11.3% vs 11.6%) and for treatment related Aes (7.7% vs 9.1%) and there was an absence of any 
increase according to specific definition of muscular disorders (myalgia, muscle spasm, pain in 
extremity). Although, the highest frequency of discontinuations due to Aes (although generally relative 
low) was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders also in the statin intolerant

studies (25 (6.0%) vs 11 (5.6%)). Levels of > 5x ULN or > 10 x ULN were rarely observed, only for 
one patient treated with bempedoic acid a >5 x ULN was observed.  
Neurocognitive disorders were very rarely observed (2 (0.5%) vs 1 (0.5%)), although this was not 
specifically evaluated. Similarly, adverse events of hypoglycaemia were only observed in one patient 
treated with bempedoic acid. 
Similar to phase 1 and 2 study findings, the suggested reversible increase in creatinine effect 
observed in the phase 1 and 2 program can also be observed in the phase 3 studies with difference in 
(mean) change in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.039 vs 0.003, and blood creatinine increased 
(3 (0.7%) vs 0) and GFR decreased (4 (1.0%) vs 0). Further, comparable limited patients (6 patients 
(0.6%)) vs 1 patients (0.5%)) dropped below the eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 level. Further, an 
increase in renal disorders was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (10 (2.4%) vs 2 (1.0%)). 
This was consistently observed across some different Aes reported including renal failure (4 (1.0%) vs 
1 (0.5%)), and renal impairment (2 (0.5%) vs 0), but not for acute kidney injury (0 vs 1 (0.5%), 
although data were rare. Treatment related renal disorders and urinary disorders were rarely reported 
(2 (0.5% vs 0). 
As in the phase 1 and 2 studies an increased frequency of uric acid (18 (4.3%) vs 2 (1.0%), 
hyperuricemia (3 (0.7%) vs 0) and gout (4 (1.0%) vs 1 (0.5%)) were observed in the phase 3 studies. 
Treatment related hyperuricemia (2 (0.5%) vs 0), blood uric acid increased (12 (2.9%) vs 1 (0.5%)) 
and gout (1 (0.2%) vs 0) were also systematically higher for bempedoic acid treatment though based 
on limited numbers. 
In the phase 1 and 2 studies, a decrease in haemoglobin was observed. During the phase 3 studies, 
an increased frequency of anaemia (3 (0.7%) vs 0), decreased haemoglobin (1 (0.2%) vs 0) and 
decreased haematocrit (1 (0.2%) vs 0) was observed with bempedoic acid treatment, although cases 
were rare. The level of decrease of haemoglobin was however limited, as this was particularly observed 
for ≥ 2g/dL and < LLN decrease (2.2% vs 0), while higher decreases were more rare (1.2% vs 0 for 
≥ 3g/dL and < LLN, and 0.5% for ≥ 5g/dL and < LLN). 
Bempedoic acid was relatively well tolerated with 13.0% vs 9.1% who discontinued due to an AE. 
The slightly higher discontinuation rate in comparison to the studies on top of statins may be (partly) 
explained by the history of generally less tolerant patients (confounded by indication). The highest 
frequency of discontinuations due to Aes was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (25 (6.0%) vs 11 (5.6%)). Also, gastrointestinal problems were reported with one of the 
highest frequencies (1.7% vs 0.5%). 
Treatment related Aes were more reported for bempedoic acid than for placebo (21.7% vs 14.1%). 
Apart from the uric acid increased (12 (2.9% vs 1 (0.5%)), no other adverse events definitions clearly 
and substantially contributed to the higher treatment related Aes. 
Incidence of adverse events according to age (18-65, 65 to 75 and over 75 years of age categories) 
did not indicate any increase in Aes with increased age. Number of patients over 85 years of age are 
very limited. A slightly higher incidence of Aes was observed for females (60.3%) than for males 
(53.2%).  
On top of statins 
The studies with statin background therapy were substantially larger (n=3008) than the statin 
intolerant pool (n=613). The studies (040, 047) with background statin therapy had a one year of 
controlled follow-up with a median exposure to study treatment of 364 days. In these studies, 1558 
patients have been treated for more than 48 weeks, which may still be considered limited for an 
intended life-long therapy. Further data will be obtained from the ongoing 1002-050 open-label 
Assessment report

extension study in which 1462 patients have been included from the largest 040 study, with 416 
patients currently treated with bempedoic acid for more than 52 weeks (2 years in total for those on 
bempedoic acid in the 040 study). Also, a cardiovascular outcome study is currently recruiting statin 
intolerant patients who are at increased risk of CV events to obtain an estimated 12600 patients with 
study results to be presented in 2024. 
TEAEs were frequently reported, although the number of Aes were approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo (76.3% vs 76.7%). A consistent slightly higher frequency was also 
observed for serious Aes (16.0% vs 15.2%), related Aes (24.5% vs 21.5%), and severe Aes (13.2% 
vs 10.7%), while moderate and mild Aes were approximately similar.  
Adverse events were mostly reported in the infection and infestations (32.8% vs 32.4%), and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25.5% vs 23.4%) categories. The most frequent 
adverse events were nasopharyngitis (8.6% bempedoic acid, 10.0% placebo), myalgia (5.2% and 
5.3%), urinary tract infection (4.8% and 5.2%, respectively), and arthralgia (4.1% and 5.2%). 
Approximately similar types of Aes in the ongoing open-label study were reported as most frequently 
observed Aes including nasopharyngitis (4.7%), urinary tract infection (3.6%), arthralgia (2.8%), 
dizziness (2.7%), and upper respiratory tract infection (2.3%).  
The frequency of serious Aes was slightly higher for bempedoic acid (16.0% vs 15.2%). The higher 
incidence was likely mainly due to cardiac disorders and most likely as a result of the high 
cardiovascular risk characteristics of these patients. The numbers for each specific individual cardiac 
serious Aes was limited (30 or less) and without substantial differences (<0.5% and without 
meaningful absolute differences in numbers) or any notable pattern. Therefore, these data do not allow 
for any meaningful conclusions. 
Cardiovascular events and deaths are of major interest, as a harmful effect should at least be 
excluded prior to marketing authorisation for a new pharmacological product according to the EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013) and the EMA Reflection paper (RP) on assessment of cardiovascular risk of 
medicinal products for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
(EMA/CHMP/50549/2015). A lower frequency of independent committee adjudicated MACE events were 
reported for bempedoic versus placebo (120 (5.0%) vs 68 (5.7%)), primarily attributed to a lower 
incidence of nonfatal MI (26 (1.1%) vs 22 (1.8%)) (and coronary revascularization (66 (2.7%) vs 40 
(3.3%)). Although not formally powered, this resulted in a numerical beneficial effect on the 3 
component MACE (CV death, MI, stroke) in the studies on maximum statin background therapy (HR 
0.80 (95%CI 0.491, 1.292) and overall phase 3 studies (HR 0.85 (95%CI 0.529, 1.373; additional 9 
events from the statin intolerant pool included) as well as other MACE definitions (except for those 
including hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 1.03 and 1.01 for 4 MACE + HF and 5 MACE + HF). An 
adequate number of patients was studied to obtain a lower than the 1.8 upper limit of the confidence 
interval mentioned in the above-mentioned RP to reasonably exclude any possible off target risk of 
cardiovascular safety.   
Although the frequency for treatment-emergent fatal adverse events was higher for bempedoic acid 
(n=19; 0.8%) than for placebo (n= 4; 0.3%), the number was very limited with 23 among 3621 
patients, making any conclusions on this imbalance uncertain. Further, this is likely an outlier result as 
this fatality rate was substantially higher than observed in the ongoing single arm open-label study 
(0.9 per 100 person-years based on a mean exposure of 306 days in 1487 bempedoic acid patients 
and 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days, versus 
0.5 patients per 100 person-years with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the 
open-label study). Furthermore, the imbalance was largely explained by the imbalance in CV events 
(10 (0.5%) vs 3 (0.3%) adjudicated) and likely due to the high CV risk profile of these patients. Of

note, a lower frequency was observed for bempedoic acid vs placebo in study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 
(0.8%)), although numbers were limited. Further, although an imbalance in the fatal Aes of the SOC of 
Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) of 5 (0.2%) vs 0 was 
observed, events were very rare and thus any conclusion on this issue remains uncertain. Moreover, 
these are unlikely to be associated with bempedoic acid as 3 out of 5 events occurred within 90 days 
after start of the study. Also, in the ongoing open-label study, any consistent pattern for the 9 fatal 
events with association to study drug could not be observed, which is reassuring.  As already 
mentioned, specific attention has been given to reporting on known adverse events from treatment 
with statins AEs due to non-clinical findings and findings observed in phase 1 and 2 studies. 
There is no sign that treatment with bempedoic acid would increase diabetes risk. Worsening of 
hyperglycemia was reported to be 7.1% for bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo with diabetes at 
baseline, and new-onset diabetes was reported to be 3.1% vs 4.7% in patients without diabetes at 
baseline. Further support for a likely absence of an effect on diabetes with bempedoic acid comes from 
data on the changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose, which showed no risk of increase or shifts in these 
parameters for bempedoic acid in both study pools. Mean change was of HbA1c was -013% vs 0.07%. 
No shifts from ≤ 5.5% to ≥ 6.5% were observed and shifts from 5.5%-6.4% to ≥ 6.5% were lower in 
bempedoic acid (7.2% vs 12.4%) and ≤ 5.5% to 5.5%-6.4% (2.0% vs 2.5%).  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (2.5% vs 1.5%), with AST increased (1.3% vs 0.3%) and ALT increased 
(0.9% vs 0.2%). ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 13 (0.6%) vs 3 (0.3%), while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed. For treatment related hepatic disorders numbers were 
limited but higher for bempedoic acid (3 (0.1%) vs 1 (0.1%)) and with higher frequency for laboratory 
values (ALT increased (0.6% vs 0.1%) and AST increased (0.7% vs 0.1%)).  
Muscular disorders are known to be dose dependently associated with statins. A higher frequency of 
muscular disorders is found for bempedoic acid vs placebo in the patients treated on top of statin 
therapy (13.2% vs 10.2%), while no increase was present in the statin intolerant study pool (see 
above). A bempedoic acid induced increase in exposure of statins by 1.2 to 2 in AUC for the different 
statins as observed in two small dedicated PK studies where a single dose statin dose was added to 
steady state bempedoic acid, could be the main driver of this observation. Due to this increased 
exposure, an amendment in both studies was implemented limiting the dose of (only) simvastatin 
to less than 40 mg. Those patients who were already on 40 mg (n=98) were discontinued treatment. 
Currently, a dose recommendation and warning statement in the SmPC has been proposed to limit the 
simvastatin dose to 20 mg in general, and 40 mg in more high CV risk patients. The low intensity 
statin category showed the highest frequency and highest difference versus placebo in muscular 
disorders (37.6% vs 23.7%; 24.7% vs 24.0%; 24.3 vs 22.5% - low, moderate, high). This may be 
likely explained by possibly relative statin intolerability in these patients with patients likely to be more 
sensitive to muscle disorders upon increased statin exposure induced by concomitant bempedoic acid 
use (confounding by indication). Further, a consistent slight increase in any muscle adverse events is 
observed for atorvastatin (13.3% vs 9.8%, rosuvastatin  12.4% vs 8.0%), simvastatin (12.2% vs 
7.4%), and pravastatin (17.5% vs 15.4%), while a lower rate in the bempedoic acid group was 
observed for the other statins (n=75). An increase in muscle related events was observed in the 
limited subgroup patients on 40 mg simvastatin (muscle disorders 11.0% (n=9) vs 2.8% (n=1); 
musculoskeletal disorders (22.0% (n=18) vs 5.9% (n=2)). Three cases of myositis (0.1%) were 
reported all with statin background therapy, one resolved after discontinuation of study medication, 
while the other 2 non-serious cases in 2 patients continued treatment. Consistent increased levels and 
shifts in CK levels for bempedoic acid were also found. AEs of increased CK levels were higher (1.9% 
vs 1.3%). Although levels of > 5x ULN or > 10 x ULN were rarely observed, a higher frequency for 
bempedoic acid was found compared to placebo (4 (0.2%) and 1 (0.1%)), supporting the increased 
Assessment report

incidence of muscular disorders. Further, a higher incidence was observed in treatment related AEs in 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (7.8% vs 6.9%), although with a less clear pattern for 
the individual related AEs of muscle spasm (2.2% vs 1.3%), pain in extremity (0.7% vs 0.4%), 
myalgia (3.1% vs 3.7%), arthralgia (0.6% vs 1.1%) and blood CK increased (0.7% vs 0.9%). Based 
on these data it is proposed to limit the dose of simvastatin (including a contra-indication for >40 mg 
simvastatin) and include a warning statement for other statins when muscle related events occur. 
There was no increased frequency of neurocognitive disorders with the treatment of bempedoic acid 
versus placebo (14 (0.7%) vs 8 (0.8%)), although this has not been specifically investigated. 
In contrast to non-clinical findings, no increased frequency of hypoglycaemia with treatment of 
bempedoic acid was observed in the clinical studies (2.0% vs 2.5%). Also, only one patient in each 
randomised group had impaired fasting glucose. 
Similar to phase 1 and 2 study findings, a reversible increase in blood creatinine observed in the 
phase 1 and 2 program can also be observed in the phase 3 studies with difference in (mean) change 
in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.048 vs -0.002, and blood creatinine increased (16 (0.8%) vs 4 
(0.4%)), GFR decreased (12 (0.6%) vs 1 (0.1%)), and blood urea increased (3 (0.1%) vs 1 (0.1%)). 
Also, the proposed mechanism of interference with the renal OAT2 pathway appears not well justified 
(see PK). Further, more patients treated with bempedoic acid (23 patients (1.1%)) vs 6 patients 
(0.6%) dropped below the eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 level. Further, an increase in renal disorders 
was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.9% vs 1.3%). This was consistently observed across all 
different AEs reported including renal failure (16 (0.8%) vs 1 (0.1%)), renal impairment (11 (0.5%) vs 
4 (0.4%), and acute kidney injury (6 (0.3%) vs 3 (0.3%)). Treatment related renal disorders and 
urinary disorders were also systematically reported at a higher frequency for bempedoic acid than 
placebo (1.5% vs 0.9%) also on an individual AE level (GFR decrease 0.2% vs 0, renal failure 0.3% vs 
0.1%, but not renal impairment (0.3% vs 0.3%)), although numbers were limited. These findings were 
explained by the creatinine increase effect. For the other events other comorbidities may have been 
involved. 
As in the phase 1 and 2 studies an increased frequency of uric acid (1.6% vs 0.4%), hyperuricemia 
(1.8% vs 0.7%) and gout (1.4% vs 0.4%) were observed. Treatment related hyperuricemia (0.3% vs 
0), blood uric acid increased (0.9% vs 0.1%) and gout (0.2% vs 0) were also systematically higher for 
bempedoic acid treatment though based on limited numbers. 
In the phase 1 and 2 studies a decrease in haemoglobin was observed. During the phase 3 studies, 
especially an increased frequency of anaemia was observed with bempedoic acid treatment (2.8% vs 
1.9%), while decreased haemoglobin (8 (0.4%) vs 3 (0.3%)) or decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) was 
rarely observed. The level of decrease of haemoglobin was however limited, as this was particularly 
observed for ≥ 2g/dL and < LLN decrease (5.1% vs 2.3%), while higher decreased were more rare 
(1.4% vs 1.3 % for ≥ 3g/dL and < LLN, and 3 (0.1%) vs 2 (0.2%) for ≥ 5g/dL and < LLN). 
Bempedoic acid was relatively well tolerated with 10.9% vs 7.5% who discontinued treatment due to 
an AE. The highest frequency of discontinuations due to AEs was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (75 (2.8%) vs 19 (1.9%))). Also, gastrointestinal problems (1.5% vs 
0.7%) and cardiac disorders (1.2% vs 0.8%) were reported with one of the highest frequencies. 
Discontinuation due to specific AEs of muscle spasms, diarrhoea, nausea, and pain in extremity were 
more frequent for bempedoic acid. For the open-label phase discontinuations due to AEs were 4.1% 
and occurred less than in the controlled studies. This may indicate better tolerability during longer 
term. 
Treatment related AEs were more reported for bempedoic acid than for placebo (24.5% vs 21.5%). For 
several of the AEs of specific interest frequencies were low and comparable between treatment groups 
including hypoglycaemia, blood glucose increase and diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, haemoglobin

decreased. While for others including muscular disorders, hepatic disorders and enzyme elevations, 
renal disorders, and uric acid elevations treatment related AEs were systematically increased in line 
with the increased reporting of TEAEs for bempedoic acid. Musculoskeletal disorders and 
gastrointestinal disorders were treatment related adverse event reported at a relatively high frequency 
and were higher for bempedoic acid (7.8% vs 6.9% (on top of statins) and 4.7% vs 3.8% (overall 
study pool)). 
Incidence of adverse events according to age has been provided for the 18-65, 65 to 75 and over 75 
years of age categories. Adverse events were slightly higher with increasing age category. Data on 
patients over 85 years of age were very limited. The frequency of AEs was slightly higher in women in 
the studies with statin background therapy, which could be related to the higher exposure. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
As it has been evaluated in a relatively limited database of statin intolerant patients, bempedoic 
acid was well tolerated although some specific side effects occurred including an increase in uric acid 
with a risk of gout, increase in serum creatinine and decrease in haemoglobin with a risk of anaemia. 
Also, some side effects known from statin use were seen also with bempedoic acid including an 
increase in liver enzymes and renal disorders.  
The safety profile was also characterised in the much larger database of patients treated on top of 
maximum tolerated statin therapy. An increased incidence of muscle disorders was seen when used 
on top of statins. This was likely driven by the increase in exposure of statin that was induced by 
bempedoic acid as identified in two dedicated PK studies. With the available numbers, CV harm can 
currently be excluded in accordance with the requirements detailed in the Reflection paper on 
assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products [EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]. The 
imbalance found in the very limited number of MACE events in the statin intolerant pool is likely a 
chance finding in association with the high baseline risk of the patients. The slight imbalance in fatal 
events is likely to be an outlier result not supported by any clear pattern in reasons for fatality. 
Overall, the clinical database is sufficient to characterise the safety profile of bempedoic acid although 
long term data is still limited and will be provided post-authorisation.  
The ongoing long term CVOT study (Study 1002-043) in 12600 statin intolerant patients treated for 
3.5 years should provide further data regarding impact of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers bempedoic acid to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Nustendi (bempedoic acid/ezetimibe). The bridging 
report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.  
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nilemdo (bempedoic acid) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary hypercholesterolemia is any hypercholesterolemia which is caused by a disorder (either 
familial- or nonfamilial) in lipid metabolism and is not caused by another condition, such as 
hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition (HeFH) is more rare 
and is estimated to occur between 1:200 and 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C levels in affected 
individuals are elevated, and in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still a 2-fold excess of CHD-
related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this population. 
Hyperlipidemia is the heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excess of lipids (ie, 
cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides) in the bloodstream. Hypercholesterolemia specifically refers to 
the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to 
genetic causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle. 
Primary nonfamilial hyperlipidemia is hyperlipidemia that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, 
although there are polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidemia is generally defined as elevated LDL-C 
and high triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. 
A large body of epidemiological evidence exists demonstrating a strong positive correlation and causal 
relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Other clinical 
manifestations of atherosclerosis also appear linked to LDL-C levels such as cerebrovascular disease 
(i.e. stroke) or peripheral vascular disease. In addition, clinical trials have shown that LDL-C lowering 
therapy especially with statins reduces the risk for CHD. The relationship between LDL-C levels and 
CHD risk holds over a broad range of LDL levels. Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous increasing 
relative risk from very low to “normal” and high levels of LDL-C, but with higher absolute risk in 
patients at the higher end of LDL-C levels. 
Bempedoic acid is an oral small molecule that is activated in the liver to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-
1002-CoA), which subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme 
upstream of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol 
synthesis pathway. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis triggers the upregulation of low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) expression in the liver resulting in increased clearance of LDL 
particles and lowering of LDL-C in the blood. Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in 
concomitant suppression of hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis. 
The following indication was agreed which includes the use on top of maximum tolerated statins, and 
the use in patients who are statin intolerant: 
Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non 
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4) or, 
• 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Statins are the cornerstone therapy for patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous 
familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C).  Statins have robustly demonstrated CV benefits in patients at increased CV risk. 
Clinical guidelines strongly recommend the use of statins in patients with elevated LDL-C levels. If 
baseline levels are between 1.8 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L (70 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL) than treatment 
aims are to reduce LDL-C levels below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or at least reduce LDL-C by 50%. In 
patients at very high risk of CV events, a need exists for additional therapies for LDL-C lowering and 
CVD prevention, because some patients who are already receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a 
statin or have limitations in statin tolerability and are not reaching LDL-C goals. It is well known that 
patients may experience statin-associated adverse effects (e.g. muscular adverse effects) that limit 
their ability to take a statin or a high enough dose of statin to reach their LDL-C goal. Statin-intolerant 
patients are at higher risk of not achieving target LDL-C levels appropriate to their level of CV risk 
given that non-statin therapies, other than PCSK9 inhibitors, typically provide only about a 15-20% 
reduction in LDL-C. 
Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors could provide additional LDL-C lowering and are indicated in adults 
with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as 
an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in combination with a statin or 
statin with other lipid lowering therapies when additional LDL-C lowering is needed (according to 
learned society guidelines as mentioned). In clinical guidelines, ezetimibe is recommended to be used 
as second-line therapy in association with statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved at the 
maximally tolerated statin dose or in patients intolerant to statins or with contraindications to statins. 
These recommendations are based on the demonstrated CV benefit of ezetimibe in the IMPROVE-IT 
trial, even if the absolute CV benefit from adding ezetimibe was limited in line with its modest effect. 
Further, PCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL-C levels very effectively and have also demonstrated CV in clinical 
trials in patients with established cardiovascular disease.  PCSK9 inhibitors are, however, not widely 
used (<5% of lipid lowering treatment) which may be (partly) due to these products being relatively 
new and primarily pricing and reimbursement issues. Further, PCSK9 inhibitors should be administered 
by injection (every 2 or 4 weeks) instead of orally, which may either be perceived as an advantage or 
a limitation depending on the patient's preferences.  
Although fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and bile acid sequestrants may provide a reduction of 
some lipid parameters including moderate reductions in LDL-C, cardiovascular benefits of these 
products have not been demonstrated.   
The use of bempedoic acid as an add-on treatment to other lipid modifying therapies, including 
maximally tolerated statins, and/or in patients who are SI could potentially provide an additional tool 
in the armamentarium to treat hyperlipidemia for patients requiring additional LDL C lowering. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Statin intolerance 
The Phase 3 program included 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
in patients with hyperlipidemia who are at risk of CV disease and were SI (used no or low dose of 
statins):

• 
Study 1002 048 (n= 269): a 12 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid (etc-1002) as an add-
on to ezetimibe therapy in patients with elevated LDL C on low-dose or less than low-dose statins. 
On top of statins 
The Phase 3 program included 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
in patients with hyperlipidemia who are at risk of CV disease on top of maximum tolerated statin 
therapy: 
• 
Study 1002 047 (n= 779): a 52 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of bempedoic acid (etc-1002) in patients with hyperlipidemia 
at high cardiovascular risk not adequately controlled by their lipid-modifying therapy. 
• 
Study 1002 040 (n= 2230): a 52 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentered long-term safety and tolerability study of etc-1002 in patients with hyperlipidemia at 
high cardiovascular risk who are not adequately controlled by their lipid-modifying therapy. 
• 
One Phase 3 OLE study (Study 1002 050) assessing 1-year safety and efficacy is ongoing.  This 
document includes interim data for 1462 enrolled patients from study 1002-040 based on a last patient 
visit of 28 September 2018. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid at a dose of 180 mg/day demonstrated a significant placebo-corrected reduction at 12 
weeks in LDL-C from baseline of approximately -21% to -28% in patients using no statin or very 
low to low doses of statins, and/or using other lipid lowering therapy.  The patients in these trials 
had baseline LDL-C levels between 3.2 – 4.1 mmol/L. Efficacy was supported by significant and 
beneficial changes in other relevant parameters of the cholesterol profile, i.e. non-HDL (-17% to -
24%), TC (-15%) and ApoB (-15% to -19%). 
The LDL-C effect of bempedoic acid was consistent across several subgroups, i.e. age, race, gender, 
ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR 
category. 
On top of statins 
Bempedoic acid at a dose of 180 mg/day demonstrated a modest placebo-corrected reduction at 12 
weeks in LDL-C from baseline of -17% to -18% on top of a maximum tolerated statin 
background therapy (2010 patients on bempedoic acid and 999 patients on placebo, respectively). 
The patients in these trials had baseline LDL-C levels between 2.6-3.2 mmol/L. Patients were at high 
to very high CV risk based on their established cardiovascular disease or equivalent CV risk estimation, 
or presence of HeFH and eligible for (additional) lipid lowering therapy according to learned societies 
guidelines criteria (ESC, AHA). Efficacy was supported by significant and beneficial changes in other 
relevant parameters of the cholesterol profile, i.e. non-HDL (-13%), TC (-11%) and ApoB (-12% to -
13%). 
The LDL-C effect of bempedoic acid was consistent across several subgroups, i.e. age, race, 
ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C, HeFH status, prior ASCVD, ezetimibe use, 
baseline GFR category.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020 
Page 142/154 
 
 
  
 
A sustained effect of LDL-C reduction has been demonstrated up to 52 weeks in the 2 placebo 
controlled studies on top of statin therapy, although the effect slightly diminished over time in the 
ongoing open label long term study including patients from the largest controlled study 040 on top of 
statin therapy. The LDL-C lowering treatment effect resulted in significantly more patients reaching the 
LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L goal (28.9% vs 8.0% at week 12 and 26.2% vs 9.1% at week 52 on top of 
statins). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated to reduce LDL-C level, an established surrogate marker for CV 
disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been formally tested yet. MACE events 
were very rarely observed. Although this was higher for bempedoic acid (9 vs 0; mainly attributed to 
coronary revascularisation), all patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. This does not likely meet the 
requirement of the upper limit of the CI to be below 1.8 which could exclude any sign of CV harm 
(Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
[EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]). However, this requirement was met for the overall phase 3 program.  
Maintenance of LDL-C lowering effect has not been fully demonstrated. The phase 3 studies were 
only 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Moreover, only patients from the studies on top of statins have been 
enrolled in the ongoing long-term open label study. 
Differences in efficacy were noted in some subgroup analyses including ethnicity, and (low dose) 
statin. The use of background low statin dose showed smaller reductions in LDL-C than patients not 
using any statin (p for interaction 0.032). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were presented across the 
following age categories of < 65 years, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 with no substantial differences in effects 
observed. Data in patients over 85 years of age were very limited.  
Relevant subgroups of patients with HeFH (0-1.7%), and patients with severe renal impairment (0-
0.6%) were underrepresented. 
On top of statins 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated to reduce LDL-C level, an established surrogate marker for CV 
disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been formally tested yet. Reassuringly, a 
numerical beneficial effect on the 3 component MACE (CV death, MI and stroke) in the statin 
background studies (HR 0.80 (95%CI 0.491, 1.292) and overall phase 3 studies (HR 0.85 (95%CI 
0.529, 1.373) was observed. The upper limit of the CI was well below 1.8 and this excludes any sign of 
CV harm (Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
[EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]).  
A bempedoic acid-induced increase in exposure of AUC (and Cmax) of statins was demonstrated. 
Administration of a single dose of simvastatin 40 mg with steady-state bempedoic acid 180 mg 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in simvastatin acid exposure. Elevations of 1.4-fold for rosuvastatin, 1.5-
fold for atorvastatin, and 1.5-fold for pravastatin (administered as single doses) and/or their major 
metabolites were observed when coadministered with bempedoic acid 180 mg. (study 1002-073) 
Higher elevations have been observed when these statins were coadministered with a supratherapeutic 
240mg dose of bempedoic acid (study 1002-012). Bempedoic acid exposure was increased in patients 
with renal impairment. The impact of the pharmacokinetic interaction with statins may be higher in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020 
Page 143/154 
 
 
  
 
these patients. Patients who were on maximum tolerated statin therapy were not down-titrated prior to 
randomisation in the phase 3 studies. The impact of this increased exposure of statins (caused by 
coadministration of BA) and the impact on the increased LDL-C lowering was not exactly clear as this 
has not been clinically tested, although subgroup analyses and additional modelling of the clinical data 
suggest that the relative contribution of bempedoic acid to the overall LDL lowering effect is highest 
with lower statin doses.  Data  on the addition of statin therapy after 24 weeks of therapy, as allowed 
by protocol (7.0% bempedoic acid vs 8.0% placebo), may have likely provided some support to 
substantiate the additional effect of statin in combination with bempedoic acid, however, data on this 
have not been provided and are likely very limited.  
Differences in efficacy were noted in some subgroup analyses. Females had larger reductions in 
LDL-C than males in the studies on top of statins. Differences in exposure between males and 
females may have contributed to these different treatment effects. For BMI a slightly different effect 
was observed, but these differences are clinically manageable. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were 
presented across the following age categories of < 65 years, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 with no substantial 
differences in effects observed. Data in patients over 85 years of age are very limited.  
The treatment effect is smaller, as observed also in the phase 2 studies, in patients treated with higher 
intensity statin therapy compared to low/moderate or no statin use at baseline (p for interaction 
0.060). Equally, for patients using any statin in the SI studies, even low dose showed smaller 
reductions in LDL-C than patients not using any statin (p for interaction 0.032). No obvious differences 
in effect were observed between the individual different statins in those studies where patients 
received bempedoic acid on top of statin therapy, but the specific doses used have not been 
mentioned.  
Relevant subgroups of patients with HeFH (4.7-6.2%), Asians (0-1.1%), and patients with severe renal 
impairment (0-0.4%) were underrepresented. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Statin intolerance 
The exposure to assess clinical safety is limited in patients who are SI. A total of 415 SI patients 
were treated with bempedoic acid with 332 treated for 12 weeks or more.   
While the total percentage of patients with adverse events was approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups (57.3% vs 51.5%, respectively) a consistent and slightly higher 
frequency of serious adverse events was observed for bempedoic acid (4.6% vs 3.5%), treatment 
related adverse events (21.7% vs 14.1%), and severe adverse events (4.6% vs 3.5%), while 
moderate and mild AEs were approximately similar.  
Bempedoic acid was reasonably well tolerated as relatively few patients discontinued treatment due 
to adverse events, although more patients on bempedoic acid discontinued than in the control group 
(13.0% vs 9.1%), with only a clear difference in gastrointestinal problems (1.7% vs 0.5%) and cardiac 
disorders (1.0% vs 0) based on limited numbers. 
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (3.9% vs 0%), with AST increased (1.0% vs 0%) and ALT increased 
1.0% vs 0%. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 5 (1.2%) vs 0, while no cases of 
potential Hy’s Law were observed.  
In the phase 3 studies in SI patients, no deaths were reported.

On top of statins 
An adequate number of patients has been evaluated for safety according to ICH guideline on the 
extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of 
non-life-threatening conditions (ICH E1). A total of 3008 patients were treated with bempedoic acid or 
placebo on a background of maximum tolerated statin therapy. Among those who received bempedoic 
acid, 1681 patients were treated for at least 24 weeks, and 416 patients were treated for more than 2 
years.   
While the total percentage of patients with adverse events was approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups (76.3% vs 76.7%, respectively) a consistent and slightly higher 
frequency of serious adverse events was observed (16.0% vs 15.2%, respectively) in patients using 
statins. Treatment related adverse events (24.5% vs 21.5%), and severe adverse events (13.2% vs 
10.7%) were also all slightly higher in bempedoic acid- than in placebo-treated patients, respectively, 
while moderate and mild AEs were approximately similar.  
Bempedoic acid was reasonably well-tolerated as relatively few patients discontinued treatment due to 
adverse events, although more patients on bempedoic acid discontinued than in the control group 
(10.9% vs 7.5%). This was mainly due to muscular disorders (2.8 vs 1.9%), gastrointestinal problems 
(1.6% vs 0.7%), and cardiac disorders (1.2% vs 0.8%). An incidence of discontinuations due to AEs of 
4.1% during the first and 2 years of treatment were reported. 
The number of muscular disorders, a known dose dependent adverse effect of statin treatment, was 
increased when bempedoic acid was used on top of statins (13.2% vs 10.2% all AEs; 7.8% vs 6.9% 
treatment related). Increases in confirmed CK levels > 5 x ULN were 7 (0.3%) vs 2 (0.2%) and > 10 x 
ULN were 4 (0.2%) vs 1 (0.1%), supporting the muscular disorders adverse event profile. The low 
intensity statin category (n= 184) showed the highest frequency and highest difference versus placebo 
in musculoskeletal disorders compared to moderate (n=1214) and high intensity (n=1526) statins 
(37.6% vs 23.7%; 24.7% vs 24.0%; 24.3 vs 22.5%). Consistent slightly increased muscle related 
adverse events were observed for coadministration of atorvastatin (13.3% vs 9.8%, rosuvastatin  
12.4% vs 8.0%), simvastatin (12.2% vs 7.4%), and pravastatin (17.5% vs 15.4%), while a lower rate 
in the bempedoic acid group was observed for the other statins (n=75). Also, in the limited subgroup 
of simvastatin 40 mg an increased incidence of muscle related adverse events was observed (muscle 
disorders 11.0% (n=9) vs 2.9% (n=1); musculoskeletal disorders (22.0% (n=18) vs 5.9% (n=2)).  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (2.5% vs 1.5%), with AST increased (1.3% vs 0.3%) and ALT increased 
0.9% vs 0.2%. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 13 (0.6%) vs 3 (0.3%), while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Statin intolerance 
The long-term exposure is very limited as both phase 3 studies were no longer than 12 and 24 
weeks. 
The number of adjudicated cardiovascular events within the phase 3 SI patient studies are very 
limited but higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo with 9 vs 0. This was mainly attributed to 
coronary revascularisation. All patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. No specific MACE analysis has been

provided for the SI pool, although the 3 component MACE in the overall phase 3 program was 0.85 
(95% CI 0.53, 1.37). 
No relevant effect on the incidence of new onset of diabetes or HbA1C, suggested to be 
associated with statin therapy, was found for bempedoic acid. Worsening of hyperglycemia was 
reported to be 5.1% for bempedoic acid vs 9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and 
new-onset diabetes was reported to be 1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Mean 
change for HbA1c was -0.03% vs 0.20%. This was based on limited data. 
A reversible increase in creatinine is observed mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with 
bempedoic acid (mean change in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.039 vs 0.003, and blood 
creatinine increased (3 (0.7%) vs 0), GFR decreased (4 (1.0%) vs 0). Based on in vitro tests it is 
suggested that bempedoic acid interferes with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway) and that 
the effect is reversible; however, clinical interaction data to support this are lacking. Further, an 
increase in renal disorders was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.4% vs 1.0%), although 
data were limited. Renal failure was 4 (1.0%) vs 1 (0.5%)) and renal impairment 2 (0.5%) vs 0. 
There was a reversible increase frequency of uric acid (4.3% vs 1.0%), hyperuricemia (0.7% vs 
0%) and gout (1.0% vs 0.5%) although data are limited. It is suggested that bempedoic acid 
interferes with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway), however, data on reversibility and 
support for this proposed mechanism have not been clearly presented.  
Adverse events of anaemia were observed with bempedoic acid treatment (3 vs 0), decreased 
haemoglobin (1 vs 0) and decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) although rarely observed.  
No effect on neurocognitive adverse events was found (2 (0.5%) vs 1 (0.5%)), although this was 
not specifically investigated, and numbers of spontaneous reported neurocognitive AEs are few. 
The adverse events profile according to subgroups of all relevant age categories and according to 
renal status have not been presented.  
On top of statins 
A bempedoic induced increase in exposure of AUC (and Cmax) of statins of 1.4-1.7 for 
rosuvastatin, 1.5 for atorvastatin, 1.5-2.0 for pravastatin and 1.9-2.0 for simvastatin acid is observed 
after single dose administration of the statin on top of steady state bempedoic acid as evaluated in two 
specific PK studies (study 1002-012 low-mid dose statin, 240 mg bempedoic acid; study 1002-037 
high dose statin, 180 mg bempedoic acid). This could likely be the main driver of the observed 
increased incidence of muscular disorders as observed for the most often used statins (atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin and simvastatin) during the studies.  
The long-term exposure is still limited to 416 patients treated for 2 years, while 1558 patients have 
been treated for more than 48 weeks with bempedoic acid. 
The number of adjudicated cardiovascular events within the phase 3 program are still limited with 
188 in 3621 patients, although the event frequency was slightly lower in the bempedoic acid versus 
control groups, with 111 (5.5%) vs 68 (6.8%) in the studies on top of statins and 120 (5.0%) vs 68 
(5.7%) in the overall phase 3 studies. This analysis is primarily driven by coronary revascularisations 
(66 (2.7%) vs 40 (3.3%) in the overall Phase 3). Although the studies were not powered for analysis 
of adjudicated MACE events, a relative risk analysis excludes evidence of cardiovascular harm for 
bempedoic acid with an observed hazard ratio (95% CIs) on the 3 component MACE in the statin 
background studies of 0.80 (0.49, 1.29) and overall phase 3 program of 0.85 (0.53, 1.37). Analyses in 
SI patients separately have not been provided. Any signs of harm were also not noticed for any 
analyses on other MACE definitions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020

In the phase 3 studies, a limited number of 23 deaths have been reported. Although the frequency 
was higher for bempedoic acid (n=19; 0.8%) than for placebo (n= 4; 0.3%), the number of events 
was very limited. This is likely an outlier result as this fatality rate in the controlled phase was 
substantially higher than in the ongoing single arm open-label study (0.9 per 100 person-years based 
on a mean exposure of 306 days in 1487 bempedoic acid patients and 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 
placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days, versus 0.5 patients per 100 person-years 
with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the open-label study). Furthermore, the 
imbalance is largely explained by the imbalance in CV events (10 (0.5%) vs 3 (0.3%) adjudicated) and 
likely due to the underlying high CV risk of the patients. This observation is not consistent across 
studies as a lower frequency was observed for bempedoic acid vs placebo in study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 
(0.8%)), which is reassuring.  
Further, although an imbalance in benign and malignant neoplasm was observed (5 (0.2%) vs 0), 
the numbers are very limited making any conclusions on this issue uncertain. Further, any association 
with therapy is unlikely as 3 out of 5 events occurred within 90 days after start of the study. Also, in 
the ongoing open-label study, any consistent pattern for the 9 fatal events with association to study 
drug could not be observed, which is reassuring.  
No relevant effect on the incidence of new onset of diabetes or HbA1C, suggested to be associated 
with statin therapy, was found for bempedoic acid. Worsening of hyperglycemia was reported to be 
7.1% for bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo with diabetes at baseline, and new-onset diabetes was 
reported to be 3.1% vs 4.7% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Mean change for HbA1c was -
0.13% vs 0.07%.  
A reversible increase in creatinine was observed mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with 
bempedoic acid. Mean change from baseline to week 12 in creatinine was 0.048 vs -0.002, and blood 
creatinine increased (16 (0.8%) vs 4 (0.4%)), GFR decreased (12 (0.6%) vs 1 (0.1%)). Some in vitro 
data suggested that bempedoic acid interferes with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway), 
however, these in vitro data are inconsistent and clinical data to support this proposed mechanism 
have not been clearly presented. The applicant has committed to further investigate the role of OAT2 
in the renal excretion of creatinine and uric acid (PAM)Further, an increase in renal disorders was 
observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.9% vs 1.3%). Renal failure was 16 (0.8%) vs 1 (0.1%)), 
renal impairment (11 (0.5%) vs 4 (0.4%), but acute kidney injury was 6 (0.3%) vs 3 (0.3%). 
There was a reversible increased frequency of uric acid (1.6% vs 0.4%), hyperuricemia (1.8% vs 
0.7%) and gout (1.4% vs 0.4%) and treatment related hyperuricemia (0.3% vs 0), and blood uric acid 
increased (0.9% vs 0.1%).  
Adverse events of anaemia were observed with bempedoic acid treatment (2.8% vs 1.9%), while AEs 
of decreased haemoglobin (8 (0.4%) vs 3 (0.3%)) or decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) were rarely 
observed.  
No effect on neurocognitive adverse events was found (14 (0.7%) vs 8 (0.8%)), although this was 
not specifically investigated and numbers of spontaneous reported neurocognitive AEs are few. 
The adverse events profile according to subgroups of all relevant age categories and according to 
renal status have not been presented.  
The potential interactions of the major inactive metabolite ETC-1002-glucuronide is not exactly clear 
as its steady state concentrations are unknown and will be investigated post-authorisation.  
Decreases in bleeding time (APTT and PT) were observed in rats at exposure levels equivalent to 
the human dose. Data in two short term phase 2 studies did not show such an effect. The effect is 
likely to be an artefact of alterations in blood cell to plasma ratios due to the anemia.

3.6.1.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.2.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia, mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who were SI has demonstrated significant consistent 
reduction in LDL-C and other relevant lipid parameters like non-HDL, TC and ApoB. Furthermore, the 
effect was robust across several subgroups including age, race, gender, ethnicity, region, history of 
diabetes, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR category.  Bempedoic acid 
displays an acceptable safety profile, with a relatively low number of patients discontinuing 
treatment and/or suffering a serious adverse event. However, bempedoic acid has some specific 
adverse effects including reversible increases in uric acid and gout, and a sustained increase in serum 
creatinine. Further, a decrease in haemoglobin with increased anaemia is observed for which the long-
term impact remains uncertain. Also, bempedoic acid demonstrates some of the side effects known to 
be associated with lipid lowering therapy including liver- and renal disorders. In contrast, no 
association is suggested between the use of bempedoic acid and the risk of diabetes or muscular side 
effects, side effects associated with the use of statins. 
For SI patients, long term effects beyond 24 weeks are lacking. Despite a very limited increase in CV 
events, information about long term potential cardiovascular harm, deduced by extrapolating the 
results from the bempedoic acid MACE data on top of statins, likely excludes any trend towards the risk 
of cardiovascular harm. Further data will be provided with the ongoing CV outcome study in SI 
patients. 
On top of statins

Bempedoic acid used in patients on top of maximum statin therapy including ezetimibe and very 
limited use of PCSK9 inhibitors has demonstrated a modest reduction in LDL-C. The effect was 
consistent for other relevant lipid parameters like non-HDL, TC and ApoB and robust across several 
subgroups including age, race, ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C, HeFH status, prior 
ASCVD, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR category. 
Although the effect was modest, it can be considered to be clinically relevant as the reduction in 
LDL-cholesterol is an established surrogate marker for cardiovascular outcome. The 18% reduction in 
LDL-C from a baseline LDL-C level of 2.6-3.2 mmol/L could potentially translate in a clinically relevant 
risk reduction of approximately 15% of major CV events based on this relationship established for 
statin therapy (over 5 years). 
Analyses of MACE events on top of statins did exclude any trend towards cardiovascular harm, as 
required before approval (Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal 
products [EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]). The slight increase in deaths with bemepdoic acid in the 
randomised studies is based on very limited numbers making any conclusions uncertain; this is likely  
an outlier result as the death rate on bempedoic acid treatment was substantially higher than in the 
ongoing open-label study and deaths could largely be explained by the high CV risk profile of the 
patients. Further, the higher frequency of very rare cases of neoplasms occurred mostly short after 
study start, which makes any association with bemepdoic acid treatment unlikely. The actual impact of 
the long-term lipid reduction with bempedoic acid in terms of improved cardiovascular outcome is still 
missing and will be addressed in the post-authorisation phase. A long-term outcome study in 12600 SI 
patients treated for 3.5 years is ongoing and should provide more insight on these uncertainties.  
Although in general a comparable safety profile of bempedoic acid is demonstrated when compared 
with the group characterized by statin intolerance, an increased frequency of muscular disorders was 
observed. This is most likely driven by the bempedoic acid induced increased exposure of statins. 
Administration of a single dose of simvastatin 40 mg with steady-state bempedoic acid 180 mg 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in simvastatin acid exposure. Elevations of 1.4-fold for rosuvastatin, 1.5-
fold for atorvastatin, and 1.5-fold for pravastatin and/or their major metabolites were observed when 
coadministered with bempedoic acid 180 mg.  The current proposed dose recommendation, to limit the 
simvastatin dose prior to use of bempedoic acid, is considered acceptable. 
Long term data of bempedoic acid on top of statins; beyond one year of treatment, can be considered 
limited since the intended treatment may be lifelong. However, the data available indicate that efficacy 
is maintained over time and safety so far does not suggest any long-term major concerns. 
3.6.3.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The applicant has proposed an indication for bempedoic acid in adults with primary 
hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct 
to diet either in combination with maximum tolerated statins (with or without other lipid lowering 
therapies) or in patients with statin-intolerance or for whom statins are contra-indicated.  
Statin intolerance 
Patients included in the studies were generally in need of further treatment to reduce LDL-C levels due 
to their increased cardiovascular risk. A substantial clinically relevant lipid reduction is observed, with 
an acceptable safety profile including some statin like, but less outspoken, adverse events and some 
more specifically related to the use of bempedoic acid of which some of these appear to be reversible. 
The safety findings are based on limited data, but the findings are largely consistent with the safety 
profile observed in bempedoic acid on top of statins.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86202/2020 
Page 151/154 
 
 
  
On top of statins 
The strategy of patient inclusion was generally in line with clinical practice guidelines as the included 
patients had elevated LDL-C levels despite treatment with statins and other lipid lowering therapy. All 
patients were in need for further treatment to reduce LDL-C levels due to their high cardiovascular 
risk. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors were only used in up to 15% and 2%, respectively, of the patients 
despite proven cardiovascular benefit and are indicated for a similar patient population as agreed for 
bempedoic acid. This may potentially limit the external validity of the currently obtained data. In both 
studies, only a modest incremental lipid reduction was seen with adding bempedoic acid to statins, 
especially on top of high intensity statins and/or on top of ezetimibe.  
The combined use of bempedoic acid and statins appears to be complex as both target a 
similar pathway for cholesterol inhibition. Bempedoic acid also increases statin exposure. 
Elevations of 2-fold for simvastatin and 1.4-fold to 1.5-fold in AUC of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and 
rosuvastatin and/or their major metabolites were observed when coadministered with bempedoic acid 
180 mg. This increased statin exposure is likely to be the main driver of the increased incidence of 
muscle disorders as observed in the pool of bempedoic acid on top of statins and seen for 
atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin as the most used statins during the studies; a side effects 
being absent in the SI pool. However, this does not exclude any other potential factors for this 
observed safety issue. To address this potential problem, the simvastatin dose should be limited to 20 
mg generally and 40 mg for high risk patients prior to initiation of bempedoic acid treatment (section 
4.2 of the SmPC), to contra-indicate higher doses than 40 mg simvastatin, and to reduce any statin 
dose when muscle related events occur (section 4.4 of the SmPC). It is acknowledged that this 
approach has not been formally tested in the clinical studies. Data on the addition of statin therapy 24 
weeks after randomisation as allowed by protocol (7.0% bempedoic acid vs 8.0% placebo) in the 
phase 3 studies has not been provided due to the limited numbers. Nevertheless, a 2- fold dose 
reduction of simvastatin, as would be needed for patients already on a 80 mg simvastatin dose, is 
expected to result in an approximately 2-fold reduction in exposure based on the data as presented in 
the single dose PK study and may thus match a comparable exposure as prior to bempedoic acid use. 
Differentiation in recommendations for simvastatin as compared to recommendations regarding other 
statins was considered acceptable. This risk is likely to be higher for simvastatin (e.g. based on the 
SEARCH study), higher doses of simvastatin were largely excluded by the introduction of a specific 
amendment during the study (simvastatin use < 40 mg), and the interaction with bempedoic acid-
induced increase exposure is the strongest for simvastatin (2-fold vs 1.5-fold for other statins). But 
given that an increased risk is already observed with simvastatin 40 mg, although based on limited 
data (higher frequency of muscle related events with the 40 mg dose in the study with one case of 
myositis), and exclusion of higher doses than 40 mg with the proposed dose recommendation, a 
contra-indication for simvastatin > 40 mg in section 4.3 of the SmPC was included. Currently, a 
warning statement for the potential risk of myopathy with concomitant use of other statins than 
simvastatin is also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined in 
a dedicated CV outcome trial. Although a reduction in LDL-C is considered to be a valid surrogate for 
cardiovascular risk reduction, this finding is mainly based on outcome data obtained with statins. It is 
acknowledged that more recent studies in ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors strengthen the value of LDL-
C as a surrogate marker. However, bempedoic acid has a new mechanism of action for which a 
similar relationship has eventually to be established. The cardiovascular outcome trial (Study 1002-
043) in SI patients) is already ongoing and should provide further data regarding cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality in patients treated with bempedoic acid.

3.6.4.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Proposed indication for statin intolerant patients 
For SI patients the proposed indication refers to adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia 
(heterozygous familial and non-familial), or mixed dyslipidaemia as an adjunct to diet alone or in 
combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a 
statin is contraindicated. This suggests that bempedoic acid could be the preferred therapy in SI 
patients (after statins have been tried (and found to be not tolerated) over other available therapies. 
Data on the specific lipid lowering effect of bempedoic acid in patients without lipid lowering therapy 
demonstrates a significant 22% reduction of LDL-C (95%Ci -26.9, -18.5, p<0.001) for the combined 
data of bempedoic acid in patients with no lipid lowering background therapy based on 180 vs 91 
patients (bempedoic acid vs placebo). This is largely in line with the effects observed in the studies 046 
and 048 in patients with no or low dose of statins. It is scientifically plausible that the reduction in LDL-
C by bempedoic acid will confer comparable benefits as existing drugs including statins, ezetimibe, and 
PCSK9 inhibitors, but adequately powered confirmatory data are not available.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nilemdo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nilemdo is favourable in the following indication: 
Nilemdo is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4) 
or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are 
statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that bempedoic acid is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.  
Paediatric Data 
No significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan P/0185/2018 have been completed, in 
accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, after the entry into force of that 
Regulation.

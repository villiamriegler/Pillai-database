Extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (dispersible tablets) associated with a 
new strength (25 mg), grouped with a type II extension of indication variation (C.I.6.a) to include the 
treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of children of at least 10 kg of body weight for 
the approved Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets; as a consequence, sections 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. Version 
3.3 of the RMP has been submitted and Annex II is updated to remove the specific obligation related to 
an in vitro study using the HFS-TB model. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Deltyba was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/07/524 on 30/04/2014 in the following 
condition: treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0271/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0271/2019 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0271/2019 eligible for the reward. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related 
to the proposed indication. 
It is considered that Deltyba 25mg is not similar to Sirturo, Granupas and Dovprela (Previously 
Pretomanid FGK) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication for Deltyba is its use, as part of an appropriate combination regimen, for 
pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children and infants with 
a body weight of at least 30 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed 
for reasons of resistance or tolerability. 
The Company is applying for an extension of the indication in infants and children with a body weight 
of at least 10 kg. In a previous variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/002552/II/0040) extension of the 
indication from adults to adolescents and children with a body weight of at least 30 kg was granted. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
It is estimated that 3.6% of the tuberculosis (TB) cases worldwide are multidrug-resistant (MDR); i.e: 
resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. Childhood TB comprises approximately 10% to 15% of the global 
TB disease burden, with higher rates in developing countries. Based on estimates of total MDR-TB 
cases this translates to a minimum global estimate of approximately 40 000 paediatric cases of MDR-
TB per year. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Childhood TB disease is different from adult TB disease. These differences include time from exposure 
to disease onset, epidemiologic differences in contagiousness, pathophysiology, bacillary load, and 
clinical and radiographic manifestations. Most cases of childhood TB have a short period between 
exposure to a contagious individual and manifestation of symptoms. Differences in the pathophysiology 
and clinical presentation of TB in children make diagnosis more challenging in children than in adults 
and definitions of latent infection and active disease are not as clear. Children are also at a much 
higher risk of progression to active disease than adults. This risk is greatest for infants and children 
under 2 years of age. 
Infants have a particularly high rate of morbidity and mortality from TB. Children under the age of 5 
years are frequently affected by peripheral lymphadenopathy and 65% to 75% of these children have 
a thoracic and mediastinal location. In a setting with a high incidence of TB and ongoing transmission, 
the most common clinical presentation of TB in young children, ie, age ≤ 5 years, is likely to be 
pulmonary TB. 
Older children and adolescents (> 10 years) often present with adult-type cavitary disease with a high 
bacillary load. Pleural TB typically has been considered a disease of adulthood and is estimated to 
comprise approximately 4% of disease cases. However, TB pleural effusions can complicate 12% to 
38% of cases in children with untreated pulmonary TB. Pleural involvement is more common among 
adolescents, and the mean age at diagnosis is 13 years. Adult-type disease is a phenomenon that 
suddenly appears around puberty and is distinguished by cavitation that occurs predominantly in the 
lung apices. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 7/62 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the lifetime risk of progression from infection to active disease is 5% to 20% for 
immunocompetent older children and 40% to 50% for children in the first 2 years of life. Adolescents 
have a slightly higher risk of disease progression than adults. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The diagnosis of childhood TB is challenging. Microbiological confirmation is often not available due to 
the paucibacillary nature of disease and the difficulty of specimen collection (especially sputum) in 
younger children. The diagnosis usually relies on nonspecific clinical and radiologic signs, as well as a 
history of exposure (ie, close contact with a TB case). Fever (possibly intermittent or low grade), 
weight loss or failure to thrive, and persistent cough for > 2 weeks are the most important clinical 
signs for pulmonary TB. 
Children are diagnosed with either confirmed or presumed MDR-TB. Confirmed disease occurs when an 
organism is isolated from the child and is shown either genotypically or phenotypically to be resistant 
to isoniazid and rifampicin. Presumed disease occurs when TB is diagnosed in combination with either 
known contact with an MDR-TB case or after failure of appropriate first-line therapy when adherence 
has been verified. Incident cases of childhood TB reflect recent transmission, which implies that drug 
resistance patterns observed among paediatric TB cases reflect primary (transmitted) drug resistance 
within the community. If a child presenting with TB is a known contact of an adult with MDR pulmonary 
TB, the child is a probable MDR-TB case and should be managed accordingly. 
The EMA Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of 
bacterial infections to address the clinical development of new agents to treat pulmonary disease due 
to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (EMA/CHMP/EWP/14377/2008 Rev. 1, 20 July 2017) gives the following 
recommendations on the paediatric population: 
- The presentation and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is similar in adults and paediatric patients 
aged from approximately 10 years so that an extrapolation of safety and efficacy data obtained from 
adults is acceptable. Sponsors may also consider including adolescent patients with tuberculosis in 
trials conducted in adults. 
- The presentation of clinical disease may be different in children aged less than approximately 10 
years compared to adults but the response to treatment may be comparable at least from the age of 
five years upwards, supporting the possibility of extrapolating efficacy documented in adults (and 
possibly also adolescents if they are enrolled into the same trials as adults) to this age group. 
- There are recognised difficulties in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in children aged less than 5 
years in whom extrapulmonary disease occurs more often and the clinical presentation and radiological 
findings may differ from those in older children and adults. Nevertheless, an extrapolation of efficacy 
data in adults to paediatric age groups is considered to be possible provided that appropriate age-
specific dose regimens can be established using pharmacokinetic data obtained in children with 
tuberculosis and the safety profile is shown to be acceptable. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in these 
children should be based on age-specific criteria recommended by internationally recognised expert 
bodies. 
- Sponsors may also consider establishing post-authorisation registries for collecting data on treatment 
outcomes from paediatric patients. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment of drug-resistant TB is long, expensive and associated with frequent adverse events. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 8/62 
 
 
 
 
children, treatment is further complicated by limited data on appropriate dosing and safety, and a lack 
of child-friendly formulations. New anti-TB drugs are urgently needed to improve treatment tolerability 
and outcome, particularly for MDR-TB cases with additional second-line drug resistance, for whom 
identifying at least four active drugs is difficult with the current armamentarium of drugs. 
The principles for treating adults with MDR-TB have demonstrated over time that they generally apply 
to infants, children, and adolescents, and the regimens recommended by the WHO for childhood-type 
TB continue to be essentially the same as for adult-type TB. 
Children with MDR-TB are managed in much the same way as adults, although there are some 
differences. Confirmation of MDR-TB may not be possible in children and child TB cases in recent close 
contact with an adult MDR-TB case or failing to respond to adherent first-line treatment should be 
empirically treated as MDR-TB cases. Because of the paucibacillary nature of early primary disease 
(contained primary lung lesion or uncomplicated hilar/mediastinal lymph node enlargement), these 
children may need fewer drugs and shorter durations of treatment, although there are no randomised 
studies to confirm this. 
About the product 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: 
J04AK06. 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the 
mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. 
The mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated for delamanid. Delamanid requires intracellular 
activation for their biological function. Under aerobic conditions, delamanid disrupts the formation of 
mycolic acids, major constituents of the cell envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Under anaerobic 
conditions, delamanid acts by respiratory poisoning through generation of reactive nitrogen species, 
including nitric oxide. 
These activities require nitro-reduction of the active substance within the mycobacterial cell by a 
deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn), which is dependent on the reduced form of the cofactor 
F420. Reduction of F420 is accomplished by the F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 
Fgd1. 
Paediatric formulation 
The 50 mg tablet formulation used in the paediatric population weighing more than 30 kg is the same 
formulation and strength as used in adults. This adult formulation has been approved. A paediatric 
formulation of delamanid (DPF) was developed as immediate-release dispersible tablets containing 25-
mg of delamanid, intended to be reconstituted in water as an extemporaneous suspension for oral 
ingestion. This new DPF is subject of the current line extension procedure. 
Posology 
For the currently approved 50 mg tablet formulation: 
The recommended dose for adults is 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients with a body weight of 
- 
- 
≥ 30 to < 50 kg: the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily for 24 weeks 
≥ 50 kg: the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 9/62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients with a body weight below 30 kg Deltyba 25 mg dispersible tablets should be used. 
The proposed posology for the 25 mg dispersible tablets is: 
Paediatric patients with a body weight of 
- 
- 
≥ 10 to < 20 kg: the recommended dose is 25 mg twice daily for 24 weeks 
≥ 20 to < 30 kg: the recommended dose is 50 mg every morning and 25 mg every evening for 
24 weeks 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application is a line extension to the already approved Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets. The 
scope is to add 25 mg dispersible tablets and extend the indication to infants and children with a body 
weight of at least 10 kg.  
The finished product is presented as dispersible tablets containing 25 mg of delamanid.  
Other ingredients are: hypromellose phthalate, povidone (K-25), all-rac-α-tocopherol, mannitol, 
crospovidone, sucralose, silica colloidal hydrated, cherry micron OT-22685 and calcium stearate. 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Deltyba 25 mg dispersible tablets introduced with this line extension application contain the same 
active substance, delamanid, used to manufacture the already approved Deltyba 50 mg film-coated 
tablets. No new information on the active substance has been provided within this application. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Deltyba 25 dispersible tablets are white to off white, round, debossed with “DLM” and “25” on one side. 
The aim of the development was to obtain a formulation for paediatric use.  
Delamanid is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The active substance is practically insoluble in 
water and its solubility increases only slightly under a lower pH (under 4).  
The excipients used in the formulation are hypromellose phthalate, povidone (K-25), all-rac-α-
tocopherol, mannitol, crospovidone, sucralose, silica colloidal hydrated, cherry micron OT-22685 and 
calcium stearate. These are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with 
Ph. Eur. and USP/NF standards, except for the flavouring agent cherry micron OT-22685 that is 
controlled by an in-house specification. The flavouring agent is composed of the following ingredients: 
flavourings, starch sodium octenyl succinate and reduced palatinose. A statement was given declaring 
its compliance with the EU Flavouring Regulation 1334/2008. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The compatibility of the excipients with the active substance was confirmed during preliminary stability 
studies. Delamanid showed no compatibility issues with all the excipients used in the formulation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 10/62 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process for delamanid 25 mg dispersible tablets consists of the following processes: 
dispersion of the active substance in a polymer matrix, powder blending and the tableting process. 
A risk evaluation was performed to identify the factors potentially affecting the proposed critical quality 
attributes (CQA) throughout the manufacturing process of the dispersible tablets. Each of these factors 
was reviewed to identify critical unit operations which needed further investigation. The critical steps 
were identified. Based on the CQAs, process parameters for the critical steps were evaluated and the 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were identified. 
The dissolution method for delamanid dispersible tablets is the same as for the approved delamanid 50 
mg film-coated tablets.  
The data demonstrates that the developed 25 mg dispersible tablets and manufacturing process deliver 
a product compliant with the defined QTTP and CQAs. 
The clinical and intended commercial dispersible tablets are exactly the same formula except that the 
clinical dispersible tablets have no debossing letters. 
The primary packaging is an aluminum/aluminum foil blister. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Two manufacturers are involved in the manufacturing process. Both manufacturers are the same as the 
ones  used  for  the  already  authorised  Deltyba  50  mg  film-coated  tablets.    As  indicated  above,  the 
manufacturing  process  consists  of:  dispersion  of  the  active  substance  in  a  polymer  matrix,  powder 
blending and tableting  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies.   
A  concurrent  validation  approach  is  proposed  for  the  validation  of  the  dispersible  tablets  at  the 
commercial manufacturing site. The results from formal stability batches, trial batches and site transfer 
justification batches show a robust process that is also supported by prior knowledge and appropriate 
quality  risk  management  and  risk  mitigation.  The  concurrent  process  validation  scheme  provided  is 
acceptable. 
To justify the manufacturing process for the proposed commercial 25 mg dispersible tablets, the process 
validation  at  the  proposed  commercial  production  scale  will  be  performed  prior  to  marketing  of  the 
dispersible tablets. The applicant should commit to immediately notify the CHMP of any non-compliance. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: identification (visual), identification of tocopherol (HPLC with PDA), degradation products (HPLC), 
fineness of dispersion (HPLC), content uniformity (HPLC), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), 
assay of delamanid (HPLC), assay of tocopherol (HPLC) and microbial limit test (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification for the 25 mg dispersible tablets is based on the one established for Deltyba 50 mg 
film-coated tablet. The proposed specification is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 11/62 
 
 
 
 
assessment and the presented batch analysis data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to 
include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for identification and assay testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above mentioned release specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing. 
A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was based 
on the combined recommendations from health authorities, Questions and answers for Marketing 
Authorisation Holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products (EMA/409815/2020), and 
the assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products (EMA/369136/2020). It was concluded that there is no risk of 
N-nitrosamine contamination and there is no risk related to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the product. Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for Deltyba are necessary to mitigate 
potential contamination by nitrosamines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for four clinical and production scale batches that have been placed 
on formal stability studies confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three representative production batches stored for up to 18 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Additionally, stability studies have also been performed on bulk tablets stored for up to 18 months at 
30 ºC / 75% RH. Samples were tested for description, assay (delamanid and tocopherol), 
impurities/degradation products, dissolution, microbial limit test, water content, disintegration (37°C), 
hardness, and friability. No significant changes were observed on any of the measured parameters 
under any condition.  
In addition, an open dish stress study, a photostability study and a cycling stress study have been 
completed on one representative scale batch of Deltyba 25 mg dispersible tablets. The photostability 
study, performed in accordance with ICHQ1B, indicates that the unpackaged delamanid dispersible 
tablets are sensitive to light whereas the open dish stress study indicates that unpackaged dispersible 
tablets tend to be sensitive to moisture. Therefore, a specific caution for to protect the tablets from 
light and moisture is required.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months and a storage restriction "Store 
in the original package in order to protect from light and moisture " as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the 25 dispersible tablets to enable 
administration of delamanid to infants and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The development of the formulation was based on the existing 50 
mg film-coated tablets. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
A recommendation with regards to the concurrent validation approach asking the applicant to present 
batch analysis data on dispersible tablets manufactured at the proposed commercial site has been 
raised (see section 2.2.6). 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
The following post-authorisation measure (recommendation) is included: 
-  Development batches were already manufactured at the proposed commercial scale (e.g. 
stability batches) or larger scale (trial batch) but not at the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site. A preliminary site transfer ‘justification’ study is successfully done with one 
batch of each strength. However, batch analysis data on dispersible tablets manufactured at 
the proposed commercial site are not available yet. It is assumed that such data will only be 
available once site transfer and validation activities are initiated as part of the concurrent 
validation approach. The commercial tableting process will be validated with concurrent 
validation approach for the first three commercial batches and full validation report as well as 
batch analysis results will be provided. Submission of these batch data should be addressed as 
a post-authorisation measure (recommendation). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
No additional data. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional data. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
In support of paediatric development, 2 GLP-compliant juvenile toxicity studies (027779 and 028620) 
were  completed  in  line  with  delamanid’s  paediatric  investigation  plan  EMEA-001113-PIP01-10.  These 
results were already submitted on occasion of type II variation EMEA/H/C/002552/II/0040.

Daily dosing with delamanid up to 300 mg/kg for 10 weeks, and starting in juvenile rats from PND 4, 
resulted in treatment-related findings consistent with those noted in adult animals. Based on the young 
starting age of the animals, the study is considered to support paediatric development from birth. There 
were no notable sex differences in TK parameters for delamanid in neonatal rats. Age-related differences 
in TK were limited to a ~2-fold increase in AUC (animals PND 11-18) when comparing to week 10 (adult 
age).  
The NOAELs were considered to be 3 mg/kg/day in juvenile male rats (AUC0-24h: 18760 ng.h/mL) and 
30 mg/kg/day in juvenile female rats (AUC0-24h: 49060 ng.h/mL), significantly exceeding the 
intended systemic clinical exposure. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Although the approval of the paediatric indication for Deltyba may increase the environmental exposure, 
delamanid is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical issues have been identified. 
The proposed wording for section 5.3 is agreed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the review of the non-clinical data, the application for a line-extension and an extension of 
indication for Deltyba, is considered approvable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

TB on therapy with optimised background regimen (OBR), followed by a 24-month safety and 
tolerability extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) in the same patient population, and a relative 
bioavailability trial (Trial 242-12-245) in adults to investigate the comparative bioavailability of the 
paediatric formulation (5- and 25-mg dispersible tablets) with the delamanid 50-mg tablet adult 
formulation. 
Trials 242-12-232 and 242-12-233 are age de-escalation trials that were performed sequentially in 
four groups: Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive), Group 3 
(3 - 5 years, inclusive), and Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive). 
The paediatric formulation of delamanid was developed as immediate-release dispersible tablets 
containing either 5- or 25-mg of delamanid, intended to be reconstituted in water as an 
extemporaneous suspension for oral ingestion. The dispersible tablet formulation of delamanid was 
used for the younger age groups in Trial 242-12-232 and 242-12-233, and relative bioavailability was 
conducted to compare the dispersible tablet formulation for paediatric subjects with the marketed 
tablet formulation. Further objectives regarding the formulation were the palatability of the dispersible 
tablets. 
Trials 242-12-232 and 242-12-233 were conducted in paediatric subjects ages 0.7 to 17 years with 
MDR-TB who received either the delamanid tablet formulation (6-17 years) or the delamanid paediatric 
formulation (DPF) (< 6 years) in dosing regimens ranging from 100 mg BID to 5 mg QD in an age de-
escalating design. A population PK analysis was performed on data from the 2 trials (Trial 242-12-232 
and Trial 242-12-233) to determine the doses in paediatric subjects which would provide delamanid 
exposures similar to those observed in adult subjects with MDR-TB. In addition, an exposure-response 
analysis of delamanid plasma concentrations versus QTc was also conducted on data from the 2 trials. 
Trial 242-12-245 was a randomized, 2 sequence, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover trial to 
compare the dispersible tablet formulation for paediatric subjects with the marketed tablet formulation 
and to determine the effect of a high-fat meal on delamanid PK. Further objectives regarding the 
formulation were the palatability of the dispersible tablets. 
A population PK analysis has been conducted by using data from Trials 242-12-232 and 242-12-233 in 
order to describe the PK of delamanid, evaluate the effect of covariates on the variability of PK of 
delamanid in the paediatric population, and define the paediatric doses for patients with 0 to 17 years 
of age that would result in a delamanid systemic exposure comparable to that in adults following the 
approved dose. Dosing paradigms to provide exposure comparable to adult dosing were determined 
based on simulations. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
Methods of Analysis of Delamanid and DM-6705 in Plasma for Protocol 242-12-245 
- A method utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry 
(UPLCMS/MS) was developed and validated for the analysis of delamanid (OPC-67683) and 8 
metabolites in human plasma. 
Analysis of plasma samples for OPC-67683 and DM-6705 with the LC/MS/MS method are presented in 
the bioanalytical report (TSLR14−253) and the results are correctly described. The different deviations, 
rejections of analytical runs and reanalysis of study samples have been discussed in an appropriate 
way. It can be concluded that there is no impact on the quality of the data or the integrity of the study.

It can be concluded that there is no impact on the quality of the data or the integrity of the study. 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 4 hours post-dose, regardless of food intake. 
There is no data on the absolute bioavailability. In light of the very long plasma half-life and slow 
accumulation of metabolites observed in clinical studies a single dose absolute bioavailability study is 
unlikely to contribute to the better understanding of delamanid absorption and metabolism.  
Bioequivalence 
Study n°242-12-245 
Study 242-12-245 was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover, relative 
bioavailability study comparing a 100-mg Oral Dose of Delamanid Tablets and a 100 mg Oral Dose of 
the Delamanid Paediatric Formulation in Healthy Adult Subjects. 
Each subject received a single 100-mg dose of DLM as the reference formulation and a 100-mg dose of 
DPF as the test formulation. Subjects were randomly allocated to one of 2 cohorts in which each cohort 
received the same 3 treatments (A, B, and C) given consecutively but a different sequence (ie, ABC, 
BAC). 
The treatments A, B, and C were as follows: 
- Treatment A: 100 mg DLM (2 x 50-mg tablets) with a standard meal (DLM + SM) 
- Treatment B: 100 mg DPF (4 x 25-mg tablets) with a standard meal (DLM + SM) 
- Treatment C: 100 mg DPF (4 x 25-mg tablets) with a high-fat meal (DPF + HFM) 
The palatability of the DPF was assessed at 30 minutes following each dose of IMP using a standard 9-
point hedonic scale (1 = worst; 9 = best). 
The proposed study design is appropriate for an immediate release formulation. Blood sampling 
occurred during most of the trials at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, … hours post-dosing. The median time of peak 
concentration (tmax) of the delamanid film-coated tablet was 4 hours with a range of 2 to 6 hours; the 
tmax of the paediatric dispersible tablet was 5 hours with a range of 3 to 8 hours. Therefore, the 
sampling was adequate to identify Cmax. 
The certificate of analysis has been submitted for both the test and reference product. The 
batch sizes of the test products used in the relative bioavailability study were full production 
scale batch sizes.

Geometric mean ratios (test [DPF]/reference[DLM]) and 90% CIs for delamanid Cmax and AUC∞ are 
presented in the table below. 
Table 1: Geometric Mean Ratios and 90% Confidence Intervals for Delamanid 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Administration of 100 mg Delamanid Tablets (2 x 
50-mg Tablets) and 100 mg Delamanid Paediatric Formulation (4 x 25-mg Tablets) to 
Healthy Subjects  
Based on the statistical results, 100 mg of DPF was not bioequivalent to 100 mg of DLM as the 90% 
CIs for the delamanid PK parameters (Cmax and AUC∞) were outside the 0.80 - 1.25 bioequivalence 
limits. The GMR for both the PK parameters following DPF administration was lower than that from 
DLM. 
Results of the palatability assessment using a 9-point hedonic scale (1 = worst; 9 = best) are 
summarized in the table below.  
Table 2: Summary of Palatability Hedonic Scale: Safety Sample  
A statistically significant difference in the mean score was observed for DLM (6.1) versus DPF + SM 
(7.1), p = 0.0013. 
A palatability assessment (visual hedonic scale) was performed longitudinally for subjects in Groups 3 
and 4. The vast majority of subjects in both Group 3 (3 to 5 years group) and Group 4 (0 to 2 years 
group) selected “like very much” at all timepoints. No subjects selected “dislike very much” at any of 
the timepoints, and only a few subjects selected “dislike a little.” A summary of the palatability of 
delamanid dispersible tablets is presented in Table 11.4.1.2.4-1 of the 242-12-233 CSR. Importantly, 
no subjects in the study exhibited adherence problems, discontinued study medication, or discontinued 
participation in the trial due to issues related to drug palatability.

A hedonic scale and investigational medicinal product (IMP) acceptability assessment worksheet was 
used in the study. The results of the palatability assessment conducted confirm that the dispersible 
formulation is palatable to paediatric patients and would result in enhanced ease of administration, 
adherence to the medication as well as preserve bioavailability. 
Influence of food 
Pharmacokinetics have been previously studied and systemic exposure was greater when delamanid 
was taken with food: about 2-fold greater with a standard meal and 4-fold greater with a high-fat 
meal, and hence the effect of high-fat meal on the DPF was studied.  
Delamanid Cmax and AUC∞ values were 1.4- to 2.1-fold higher following DPF administration with a high-
fat meal compared to that with a standard meal. 
In the paediatric clinical trials conducted, delamanid was administered with food that was typical for 
the children’s ages and nutritional requirements. The delamanid dose estimation modelling (for either 
the film-coated or the dispersible formulation) is therefore based on PK data that was measured under 
‘real-world’ conditions and therefore the corresponding delamanid exposure should reflect exposure 
following regular food consumption by paediatric patients in the real-world. In particular, in younger 
children, the actual typical age specific ‘standard’ meals might not vary much with respect to fat 
content reflecting the reliance on breast milk/formula feed as the main energy source with limited 
consumption of complementary food in this age group. 
Therefore, the SmPC recommends intake of delamanid with food. 
Distribution 
Delamanid and primary metabolites DM-6704, DM-6705, and DM-6706 extensively binds to all plasma 
proteins (> 99.5%) and most extensively (> 97%) to albumin and lipoproteins. Delamanid has a large 
apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F of 2,100 L). 
Elimination 
Excretion 
The elimination half-life (t1/2) of delamanid is about 30 to 38 hours, allowing steady state to be 
reached after 10 to 14 days of dosing. The elimination half-life of its major metabolite (DM-6705) is 
approximately 230 hours, and steady state is reached by 8 weeks. The single-dose 14C-delamanid trial 
indicated that delamanid and its metabolites were predominantly excreted in the faeces while renal 
excretion is a negligible pathway for elimination. 
Metabolism 
In vitro data suggest that delamanid is essentially metabolized by albumin, resulting in the formation 
of the primary metabolites DM-6705, which in turn is metabolized to DM-6704 and DM-6706. Eight 
metabolites have been identified in human plasma following multiple oral doses, though present at low 
concentrations after 10 to 14 days of dosing, representing all together about 1% to 10% of parent 
delamanid. 
Inter-conversion 
Delamanid is the R enantiomer of a chiral compound. Delamanid does not undergo chiral inter-
conversion in vivo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Delamanid and primary metabolites DM-6704, DM-6705, and DM-6706 extensively binds to all plasma 
proteins (> 99.5%) and most extensively (> 97%) to albumin and lipoproteins. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Delamanid does not show clinically meaningful induction and/or inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 
(CYP) isoenzyme activity. 
Dose proportionality 
After single or multiple oral doses in healthy subjects, as well as drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) 
and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients, delamanid plasma concentrations increase 
less than dose proportionally.  
Time dependency 
The twice daily (BID) dosing regimen for phase 2 was selected based on the fact that for a total daily 
dose of 300 mg, the 150 mg BID and the 100 mg three times daily (TID) dosing regimens showed 
higher exposure (1.93-fold to 2.23-fold higher) compared with the 300 mg once daily (QD) dosing 
regimen (Trial 242-08-211). 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
A moderate intra- and inter-individual variability has been reported for the PK parameters of 
delamanid. 
The inter-individual variability (CV%) for Cmax and AUC∞ of DPF dispersible tablet under standard meal 
was 27.1% and 34.6%, respectively (CSR 245-12-245, PKT-9). The CV% for Cmax and AUC∞ of 
delamanid film-coated tablet under standard meal was 21.6% and 21.9%, respectively (CSR 245-12-
245, PKT-8). The intra-individual variability for Cmax and AUC∞ is 22.1% and 24.6%, respectively (CSR 
245-12-245, derived from Tables STAT-1.1 and STAT-1.2, using CV% = 100 * sqrt (exp (S2 within) 
−1), whereas S2 within is the residual error). 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Less than 5% of an oral dose of delamanid is recovered from urine. Mild renal impairment (50 mL/min 
< CrCLN < 80 mL/min) does not appear to affect delamanid exposure. Therefore, no dose adjustment 
is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. It is not known whether delamanid and 
metabolites will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is 
not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
Gender 
The POPPK models submitted in the original submission investigated the following covariate 
parameters: 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 20/62 
 
 
 
 
Intrinsic factors (body size [BW, LBW, BSA], age, gender, race, geographic region, disease status 
[MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB], and laboratory values [CRCL, CRCLN, MDRD]). Exposure-related PK parameters 
were independent of gender. 
Race 
An approximately 50% higher exposure to delamanid was observed in Asian compared to non-Asian 
populations. 
Weight 
The POPPK models submitted in the original submission investigated the covariate the body size [BW, 
LBW, BSA]. Delamanid clearance was independent of weight. 
Elderly 
No patients of ≥ 65 years of age were included in clinical trials. 
Children 
In trial 242-12-232, in Groups 1 to 4, the median delamanid Cmax on Day 10 was 557, 573, 500, and 
179 ng/mL, respectively; the median AUC0-24h on Day 10 was 9790, 12000, 9290, and 2740 
ng*h/mL, respectively. The Cmax and the AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 
but were much lower for Group 4. A summary of delamanid pharmacokinetic parameters following 
delamanid administration on Day 10 is presented in Table 3. 
Table 3: Delamanid Median (Range) PK Parameters on Day 10 Following 100 mg BID 
(Group1), 50 mg BID (Group 2), 25 mg BID (Group 3) or 5-20 mg (Group 4) of Delamanid to 
Paediatric MDR-TB subjects 
The paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for delamanid in paediatric multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
(MDR-TB) patients aims to determine whether delamanid plasma exposure in children of all ages with 
MDR-TB is similar to the efficacious plasma exposure in adults; thereby determining the appropriate 
paediatric dose (using both the adult and paediatric formulations) and documenting safety and 
tolerability.

A population PK analysis was conducted for this purpose. All nonlinear mixed effects modelling 
analyses was performed using NONMEM software (Version 7.4.3).  
The final population PK model was used to simulate steady-state exposure in paediatric patients in 
different age/body weight groups, which were then compared with exposure in adults. Based on these 
results, estimated paediatric doses were determined, which will result in an exposure comparable to 
that in adults following the approved adult dose. 
Several issues were identified with the approach taken by the Applicant for population PK model 
building during the first round of evaluation.  Based on the comment made, the Applicant has updated 
the POPPK model. The updated version of the POPPK model is judged suitable to serve as a basis to 
compare PK exposure in adults and children. 
- The structural model selection as described by the applicant was judged very confusing. It was stated 
that the starting point was a 2 compartment model with a transit absorption, and still simpler models 
(one compartment, lag time, etc.) seemed to have been tested and criteria for model selection were 
vague and variable: some models were discarded for longer run times and other for lack of fitting 
improvement. This approach was not endorsed during the first round. Longer run time is not 
considered a valid argument to discard a model with better fitting performances (e.g. based on results 
of loglikelihood ratio tests). The Applicant was requested to restart the model building with structural 
model selection starting from the simpler and progressing in complexity and base the structural model 
selection on fitting performance (Log likelihood ratio tests) and on parsimony.  
The Applicant has rerun the model: the newly retained structural model was a 2 compartments model 
with transit absorption (N=4). 
- Regarding covariate model building, it was noted/anticipated that some of the covariate tested were 
highly correlated: these include formulation vs bodyweight vs age. This was judged very concerning 
given that the covariate model building was performed using a pure data driven approach. The 
Applicant was requested during the first assessment round to provide the results of correlation 
analyses for all the combinations of potential covariates and to also provide a mechanistic discussion of 
the reason why each covariate was tested on the chosen PK parameter.  
The updated information provided by the applicant adequately addresses the issues raised from the 
initial submission. 
- It was particularly noted that, given that adult formulation was administered to older children (groups 
1 & 2) while dispersible tablets were administered to younger children (groups 3&4), it would very 
probably not be possible, only using paediatric data from study 232 to disentangle the formulation and 
the age/body side effects on F and CL. Of note the formulation effect was not detected in the popPK 
analysis while the bioequivalence results showed that the two formulations are not bioequivalent: this 
is an additional evidence that the POPPK analysis as performed by the applicant was not sensitive 
enough to detect the actual effects of formulation, age and body size on PK. This was considered an 
important issue for the reliability of the dosing recommendation based on POPPK results. The Applicant 
was requested during the 1st assessment to redo the POPPK analysis including the adult bioequivalence 
PK data in the analysis dataset. This would allow adequate description of the absorption phase (which 
was hampered by the data sparsity) and better characterization of the covariate effects (formulation vs 
body size vs maturation vs dose) on the absorption (rate and extent) parameters.  
The Applicant has made some efforts to better understand the impact of age and formulation on the 
absorption of the drug. The data available did not allow estimation of the related parameters. 
Formulation effects was modelled as a fixed parameter and age effect estimated. The overall fitting 
performances on the paediatric data are now acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 22/62 
 
 
 
 
- It was noted that, without any explanation, a fixed value of 0.58 was used for the effects of 
Fractional Change by Dose < 100 mg on F1. The Applicant was requested during the 1st assessment 
round to justify and provide the source for any fixed value used during the updated model building to 
be fitted to the extended dataset. 
The data source and explanation were provided for the fixed value used for the dose effect on F1. 
- The Applicant was requested to provide pcVPC splitted by age groups for the updated model to 
ensure that model fitting performances are acceptable for each age group. In addition, the applicant 
was asked to provide pcVPC stratified on body weight during the 1st evaluation round. 
The Applicant provided pcVPC splitted by age and bodyweight groups for the updated model.  Overall, 
the model fitting performances are now acceptable. 
- The applicant was asked during the 1st assessment round to present simulations from the updated 
popPK model, comparing adult exposure to paediatric exposure, and discussing the adequacy of the 
proposed paediatric dosing. Please refer to MSWP Q&A (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-
regulatory/research-development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-
pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-questions-answer ) for details on the better manner to present 
these results. 
Comparable AUCss and Cmax values are now displayed for the recommended paediatric and the adult 
doses. The methodology used to implement the simulations and to generate the related plots/results 
were well-described and the codes were provided.  
Based on these simulations, Table 4 summarizes the simulated doses for patients with different 
age/weight groups that will result in an exposure comparable to that in adults following the approved 
adult dose.

As a result of the analysis, the following posology is being proposed for subjects weighing ≥ 10 kg. A 
BID regimen was selected for the posology as QD regimens at body weight > 30 kg would not achieve 
the adult AUC target of 7500 ng*h/mL at doses up to 100 mg, as compared to a BID regimen. 
Table 5. Proposed Delamanid Dosing Regimen for Paediatric Subjects 
For children with a body weight < 10 kg, administration of delamanid is currently not recommended by 
the MAH. In Trials 242-12-232 and 242-12-233 only 5 children with a body weight below 10 kg were 
included, whereby their weights were distributed around the upper limit (10 kg), with a lowest weight 
of 8 kg. It is therefore uncertain whether the simulation is strong for body weights below 10 kg. In 
addition, all 5 children were assigned to Group 4, and delamanid doses (5 mg BID >8kg and ≤10 kg or 
5 mg QD ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤8 kg) administered in the trials resulted in plasma exposure essentially lower 
than the targeted effective adult exposure. Delamanid’s safety profile has therefore not been 
investigated for the model informed therapeutic dose (20-25 mg BID) as currently proposed by the 
MAH for this weight group.

Interactions 
Some drug-drug interactions have been determined during previous clinical drug-drug interaction 
(DDI) studies. However, the complete metabolic profile of delamanid and mode of elimination of 
delamanid have not yet been elucidated, and there is a potential for drug-drug interactions with other 
co-administered medicinal products, if significant unknown metabolites are discovered. 
This is adequately reported in the SmPC. 
There is continued concern that there is a large portion of drug-related material circulating in plasma 
that is unidentified (96%) and unexplained by the very limited metabolite profiling that was performed 
during the mass balance study. Without identification of what is circulating in plasma, it cannot be 
concluded that the major circulating metabolites of delamanid are known. Therefore, it cannot be 
concluded that the potential for delamanid to have an effect on co-administered drugs has been 
adequately characterised.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In the two paediatric studies, the administered doses in patients 0-2 years were considerably lower 
than the revised doses proposed by the Applicant to achieve adult exposure levels (See Section 
“Children” above). Consequently, plasma exposures achieved in all study patients <10 kg were 
considerably lower than the target exposure (median AUC 2740 ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 
7500 ng*hr/mL in adults). The available data in patients <10kg are therefore not sufficiently 
informative to support an extension of the lower weight limit. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the 
mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid 
For the paediatric population, an exposure-response analysis of delamanid and its metabolite, DM-
6705, plasma concentrations versus QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was conducted on data 
from the 2 trials conducted in paediatric subjects ages 0.7 to 17 years with multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (Trial 242-12-232 and Trial 242-12-233). 
PK/QTc analysis 
The final PK/QT dataset contained 354 valid QT measurements with time-matched delamanid/DM-6705 
plasma concentrations from 37 subjects. Also, corresponding time-matched baseline QT measurements 
were obtained on Day -1. 
The relationships between QTc and plasma concentrations of both delamanid and one of the primary 
metabolites of delamanid, DM-6705 were examined. 
First, an exploratory analysis was implemented. The Graphical evaluation of the relationship between 
heart rate and QT/QTc intervals (QT, QTcB and QTcF) was evaluated via scatterplots using data at 
baseline to assess the need and the most appropriate method for heart rate correction. Before fitting 
the model, the following assumptions were evaluated: i) QTcB or OTcF as the sufficient HR correction 
method, ii) lack of drug effect on HR, iii) lack of time delay between drug concentration and ΔQTc, and 
iv) the presence of a linear concentration-QTc relationship. 
Subsequently, a linear mixed effects model was used to examine the relationship between the time-
matched change from baseline in QTc and plasma concentration of delamanid or DM-6705.

The relationship between RR and QT/QTc intervals were evaluated via scatterplots using data at drug-
free state on Day -1. The slope and correlation coefficient (Rsq) was smaller in QTcB (slope 0.03, Rsq 
= 0.044) than that in QTcF (slope 0.128, Rsq = 0.484). Thus, QTcB was determined to be a sufficient 
and more adequate correction method for heart rate than QTcF, even though QTcF was the primary QT 
variable specified in the protocol. 
Based on the linear mixed effects modelling, the concentration of delamanid does not have a 
significant impact on ΔQTcB (slope for delamanid: 0.00792 ms/[ng/mL], 90% confidence interval [CI]: 
−0.00132, 0.0172), whereas a significant positive correlation was detected for the concentration of 
DM-6705 (slope for DM-6705: 0.0613 ms/[ng/mL], 90% CI: 0.016, 0.107) as seen in the figure below. 
Slight over-prediction was observed especially at higher exposure range. 
Grey closed circles represent observed values. 
Blue closed circles and vertical bars represent binned observed data.

The fixed effect parameter estimates for the delamanid/QTcF model are listed in Table 6. The typical 
population slope estimate was 0.0154 ms/[ng/mL] (90%CI: 0.00703, 0.0237), which suggests 
delamanid concentration is a significant predictor of ΔQTcF. 
Using the developed linear mixed effects model, ΔQTcF values were predicted at delamanid 
concentrations of interest and the results are provided in Figure 2.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two trials (Trial 242-12-232 and Trial 242-12-233) were conducted in paediatric subjects ages 0.7 to 
17 years with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who received either the delamanid tablet 
formulation (6-17 years) or the delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF) (< 6 years) in dosing regimens 
ranging from 100 mg twice per day (BID) to 5 mg once per day (QD) in an age de-escalating design. 
The paediatric formulation of delamanid was developed as immediate-release dispersible tablets 
containing 5- and 25-mg of delamanid, intended to be reconstituted in water as an extemporaneous 
suspension for oral ingestion. 
A bioequivalence study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of delamanid following a 
single 100-mg oral dose of DLM tablets compared with a single 100-mg oral dose of the DPF and to 
determine the effect of a high-fat meal on the DPF (Trial 242-12-245). 
Based on the statistical results from bioequivalence study 242-12-245, 100 mg of Delamanid Paediatric 
Formulation is not bioequivalent to 100 mg of Delamanid Tablets with respect to rate and extent of 
absorption as the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval of the GMR for both Cmax and AUC∞ are 
lower than 0.8. 
Based on an age appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment, there was a statistically 
significant difference in favour of DPF in the palatability when administered with a standard meal 
compared with DLM when administered with a standard meal.  
In the current relative bioavailability trial, the delamanid Cmax and AUC∞ values were 1.4- to 2.1-fold 
higher following DPF administration with a high-fat meal compared to that with a standard meal.  
No new safety findings were reported in this trial. 
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis (clinical study report [CSR] 242-19-259) was performed on 
data from the 2 trials to determine the doses in paediatric subjects which would provide delamanid 
exposures similar to those observed in adult subjects with MDR-TB.  
A nonlinear mixed effects modelling analysis was performed using NONMEM software (Version 7.4.3). 
First order conditional estimation with η-ε interaction was used for the modelling.

In answer to the previous round’s questions, the Applicant has provided an updated version of the 
modelling and simulation results that addressed most of the issues raised in a satisfactory manner. A 
new model was developed with an approach which is state of the art and the results of model 
evaluation and related dose selection where provided using appropriate tools. 
The final population PK model was used to simulate steady-state exposure in paediatric patients in 
different age/body weight groups, which were then compared with exposure in adults. Based on these 
results, estimated paediatric doses were determined, which will result in an exposure comparable to 
that in adults following the approved adult dose. The methodology used to implement the simulations 
and to generate the related plots/results were well-described and the codes were provided. 
The DPF doses used in group 3 (3-5 years) were 25 mg BID and in group 4 (0-2 years) 10 mg BID for 
patients > 10 kg, 5 mg BID for patients >8 and ≤ 10 kg. All patients in group 3 had a body weight 
between 10 and 20.5 kg at baseline. Therefore, the recommended doses identified by simulation, 25 
mg BID for patients 10-20 kg corresponds with the one used in group 3 during trial 233. In group 4, 
the recommended dose identified by simulation would be 20-25 mg BID. In this group a lower dose (5 
or 10 mg BID) has been used in the studies. 
Consequently, plasma exposures achieved in all study patients <10 kg were considerably lower than 
the target exposure (median AUC 2740 ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 ng*hr/mL in adults). 
The available data in patients <10kg are therefore not sufficiently informative to support an extension 
of the lower weight limit. 
For children with a body weight < 10 kg, administration of delamanid is currently not recommended by 
the Applicant. In group 4 in trial 232, 5 patients with a body weight below 10 kg at baseline have been 
included. In group 4 of trial 233, 4 patients still had a body weight below 10 kg at baseline. A patient 
under 2 years old with a BW under 10 kg died shortly after starting delamanid treatment in trial 233; 
the patient had developmental parameters below the 3rd percentile at baseline and it was determined 
that the death was not related to delamanid treatment. Exposure in these patients was indeed below 
the targeted effective adult exposure and the model estimates that a 4-5 times higher dose would be 
needed in this population. 
In addition, an exposure-response analysis of delamanid plasma concentrations versus QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) was also conducted on data from trial 232 and 233. This type of model is 
normally used to rule out a QT prolonging effect. 
In a previous QTc vs concentration analysis in adults, there was a significant correlation between 
delamanid concentration and ΔQTcB/ΔQTcF. 
By linear mixed effects modelling of delamanid/ΔQTcB, no significant impact of delamanid was 
detected on ΔQTcB. For DM-6705, significant positive correlation was detected in a concentration-
corrected-QT interval ΔQTcB modelling analysis, using the linear mixed effect model. The point 
estimate of slope for DM-6705 (0.0613 ms/[ng/mL]) is consistent with the value in adults (0.0795 
ms/[ng/mL]). The typical population slope estimate for the delamanid/QTcF model was 0.0154 
ms/[ng/mL] (90%CI: 0.00703, 0.0237), which suggests delamanid concentration is a significant 
predictor of ΔQTcF. The typical population slope estimated for the DM-6705/QTcF model was 0.117 
ms/[ng/mL] (90%CI: 0.0797, 0.155), which suggests DM-6705 concentration is a significant predictor 
of ΔQTcF. 
Administration of delamanid has been shown to result in QT interval prolongation in the adult 
population and based on the exposure response simulation, this is also the case in adolescents, 
children and infants. Appropriate warning on QT interval prolongation is included in the SmPC.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The use of model informed approach for paediatric dose selection is supported. 
As for the adult population, an effect of delamanid administration (mainly via its DM-6705 metabolite) 
is noticed on the QTc interval in the paediatric population in the exposure response simulation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A tabular overview trial 233 is given below: 
Part of the results of trial 233, namely the subgroup of children aged 6 to 17 years who had completed 
the trial and follow-up period, have been submitted in a previous variation EMEA/H/C/002552/II/0040 
and lead to an extension of the indications from adults to adults, adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 30 kg. 
The results of trial 233 for the two youngest age groups (0-5 years of age) are submitted in this line 
extension procedure. The aim of this variation is to provide a justification for extension of the 
delamanid MDR-TB indication to ‘Deltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination 
regimen for pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children and 
infants with a body weight of at least 10 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be 
composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1)’.

Figure 4. Schematic trial design for Trial 242-12-233 
According to the country-specific DOT plan for Trial 242-12-233, 1 dose per day for a minimum of 5 
days per week is to be given under direct observation. All delamanid dispersible tablet doses are 
recommended to be administered with water and under fed conditions in the morning and evening 
within 30 minutes of the start of a meal. 
Optimally, OBR medications should be given at least 1 hour prior to or 1 hour after dosing of 
delamanid dispersible tablets. 
The delamanid treatment administered did depend on the age group: 
-  Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive): Adult formulation delamanid 100 mg BID + OBR (n = 
6 [target enrolment number]) 
-  Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive): Adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR (n = 6) 
-  Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive): DPF 25 mg (dispersible tablet) BID + OBR (n = 12) 
-  Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive): DPF dose based on body weight (dispersible tablet) 
during baseline visit (n = 12): 
o  Subject > 10 kg received DPF 10 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject > 8 and ≤ 10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID + OBR 
o  Subject ≤ 8 kg received DPF 5 mg once daily + OBR 
o  Delamanid dose was adjusted as needed for Group 4 subjects based on the weight 
measurement at specified trial visits (Visits 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12) 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this trial were: 
1.  To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of delamanid and its metabolites in combination 
with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB for the 
age-specific delamanid doses determined in Trial 242-12-232. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 32/62 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  To report delamanid and metabolite plasma concentrations at each visit day by age groups and to 
conduct a population PK analysis of delamanid when delamanid is administered in combination 
with an OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB. 
The secondary objectives were: 
3.  To evaluate the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship of delamanid and its metabolite DM-6705 
plasma concentrations and change in corrected QT interval (QTc) when delamanid is 
administered in combination with OBR during a 6-month treatment period in paediatric 
subjects with MDR-TB. 
4.  To evaluate the efficacy of delamanid when administered in combination with an OBR during a 6-
month treatment period in paediatric subjects with MDR-TB. 
5.  To determine the palatability of the delamanid paediatric formulation (DPF) (applicable for Groups 
3 and 4 only). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy of delamanid in treating paediatric MDR-TB subjects was based on World Health 
Organization (WHO)-recommended treatment outcomes. Efficacy endpoints included chest radiography 
(subjects with pulmonary disease), body weight/height, and resolution of TB symptoms (based on 
investigator evaluation). There were no summary tables produced for sputum culture conversion or 
drug susceptibility due to the limited availability of data. 
Blood samples were taken for determination of delamanid and metabolite plasma concentrations. 
Electrocardiograms and PK measurements for determination of the relationship between delamanid and 
DM-6705 plasma concentrations and changes in QTc interval were collected. Delamanid PK data from 
this trial were combined with PK data from the Trial 242-12-232 and analysed using population PK 
methods. 
The palatability of the paediatric formulation (ie, dispersible tablets) was assessed using an age-
appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment (Groups 3 and 4 only), within 25-30 minutes 
after the morning dose. 
Statistical methods 
All statistical presentations are descriptive due to the small sample sizes.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Thirty-seven subjects ages birth to 17 years were enrolled into Trial 242-12-233. Of the 37 subjects 
that were enrolled in the trial, 35 (94.6%) were administered IMP for ≥ 6 months. Thirty-five (94.6%) 
subjects completed the trial, ie, were evaluated at the last scheduled visit of the trial (the Day 365 
follow-up visit).

and the parent/patient score. In subjects aged 0 to 2 years (Group 4), it was reported at Visit 3 and 
Visit 12 that the majority of the subjects liked the taste of delamanid “very much” or “a little” based on 
the investigator or designee score and the parent/patient score. A palatability rating of “dislike very 
much” was only reported by 1 (8.3%) subject aged 0 to 2 years at Visit 3 based on the investigator or 
designee score.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Part of the results of trial 233, namely the subgroup of children aged 6 to 17 years who had completed 
the trial and follow-up period, have been submitted in a previous variation EMEA/H/C/002552/II/0040 
and lead to an extension of the indications from adults to adults, adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 30 kg. 
The results of trial 233 for the two youngest age groups (0-5 years of age) are submitted in this line 
extension procedure. 
The aim of this variation is to provide a justification for extension of the delamanid MDR-TB indication 
to ‘Deltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-
drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children and infants with a body weight of 
at least 10 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of 
resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1)’. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The PIP for Deltyba (EMEA-001113-PIP01-10-M02) essentially consists of 3 clinical trials in addition to 
the paediatric formulation development and juvenile toxicity assessment: a pharmacokinetic (PK) trial 
(Trial 242-12-232) in children of all ages with MDR-TB on therapy with optimised background regimen 
(OBR), followed by a 24-month safety and tolerability extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) in the same 
patient population, and a bioavailability/bioequivalence trial (Trial 242-12-245) in adults to investigate 
the comparative bioavailability of the paediatric formulation (5- and 25-mg immediate-dissolving 
tablets) with the delamanid 50-mg tablet adult formulation. 
Trials 242-12-232 and 242-12-233 are age de-escalation trials that were performed sequentially in 
four groups: Group 1 (7 patients, ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), Group 2 (6 patients, ages 6 - 11

years, inclusive), Group 3 (12 patients, 3 - 5 years, inclusive), and Group 4 (12 patients, ages birth - 2 
years, inclusive). These trials have been completed. Based on the data in group 1 and 2, 6 to 17 years 
of age, an extension of the indication to adolescents and children with a body weight of at least 30 kg 
has been approved in a prior variation procedure. Trial 233 has now been completed and data from 
paediatric patients in group 3 and 4 are submitted to obtain a further extension of the indication to 
children and infants with a body weight of at least 10 kg. Patients in group 3 and 4 were administered 
the delamanid paediatric formulation. 
The efficacy of delamanid in treating paediatric MDR-TB subjects was based on World Health 
Organization (WHO)-recommended treatment outcomes. Efficacy endpoints included chest radiography 
(subjects with pulmonary disease), body weight/height, and resolution of TB symptoms (based on 
investigator evaluation). There were no summary tables produced for sputum culture conversion or 
drug susceptibility due to the limited availability of data. It is agreed that the assessment of the 
microbiological response is often not possible in children due to the paucibacillary nature of paediatric 
TB and the fact that children do not readily produce sputum. 
The dispersible tablet formulation of delamanid was used for the younger age groups in Trial 242-12-
232  and  242-12-233,  and  relative  bioavailability  was  conducted  to  compare  the  dispersible  tablet 
formulation for paediatric subjects with the marketed tablet formulation. Further objectives regarding 
the  formulation  were  the  palatability  of  the  dispersible  tablets.  This  was  assessed  using  an  age-
appropriate visual hedonic scale and clinical assessment (Groups 3 and 4 only), within 25-30 minutes 
after the morning dose. A hedonic scale and IMP acceptability assessment worksheets were used in the 
study.  In  the  Operations  Manual  v4  dated  01  May  2017,  the  Palatability  Assessment  is  described  in 
Section  12.6,  page  40.  The  results  of  this  assessment  have  also  been  discussed  in  Section  3.3.7. 
Pharmacokinetics. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The use of delamanid in addition to OBR in paediatric trial 233 resulted in a favourable treatment 
outcome at 24 months in 10 of the 12 subjects (83.3%) aged 3 to 5 years at 24 months (3 of these 12 
subjects (25.0%) were cured and 7 of the 12 subjects (58.3%) completed treatment) and in a 
favourable treatment outcome in 11 of the 12 subjects (91.7%) aged 0-2 years (5 of these (41.7%) 
were cured and 6 of the 12 subjects (50.0%) completed treatment), even though the dose 
administered in this population aged 0-2 years was too low based on the modelling of a dose 
equivalent to the adult posology. Two patients died due to pneumonia, one in group 3 and one in group 
4. 
Overall, 15/37 (40.5%) subjects were considered cured at the end of treatment and a total of 18/37 
(48.6%) subjects achieved treatment completion, as assessed by the investigator at 24 months. 
Subjects were defined as treatment completed per WHO guidance as those subjects who completed 
treatment but did not have enough data to be considered cured. There were 2/37 (5.4%) subjects who 
were considered lost to follow up and 2/37 (5.4%) subjects died due to pneumonia. 
This limited number of patients included in the trial is acceptable as it is considered that the efficacy in 
children can be extrapolated from achieving delamanid exposures comparable to effective exposure in 
adults. 
The majority of the subjects in Groups 3 and 4 found the paediatric formulation to be highly palatable. 
In trial 233, no subjects selected “dislike very much” at all time points, and few subjects selected 
“dislike a little,” per either the investigator/sub-investigator/nurse score or parent/patient score. The 
majority of subjects in both Group 3 (3 - 5 years group) and Group 4 (0 - 2 years group) selected “like

very much” at all time points for the palatability evaluation. Also in trial 232, the majority of the 
subjects in Groups 3 and 4 found the paediatric formulation to be highly palatable. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy in children can be extrapolated from achieving delamanid 
exposures comparable to effective exposure in adults. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All 37 subjects enrolled in Trial 242-12-232, received all doses of IMP for 10 days, completed the trial 
and were enrolled in Trial 242-12-233. 
Of the 37 subjects enrolled in Trial 242-12-233, 35 (94.6%) were exposed to at least 6 months of the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP). One subject in Group 4 (ages 0 - 2) had exposure of less than 
1 week and one subject in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17) missed all doses for the last 80 days of treatment. 
The total subject days of IMP exposure, defined as the total duration of IMP exposure for all subjects 
under the same age group, was assessed resulting in 6487 days in total. In Group 1 (ages 12 - 17), 
total subject days of IMP exposure was 1196 days for the 7 subjects, 1092 days for the 6 subjects in 
Group 2 (ages 6 - 11), 2190 days for the 12 subjects in Group 3 (ages 3 - 5), and 2009 days for the 
12 subjects in Group 4 (ages 0 -2)). 
Adverse events 
In trial 233, a total of 246 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced in all age 
groups. Of these events, 185 occurred before end of IMP administration and were reported in 36 
subjects (97.3%). The 4 most frequently reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection 
(14/37 subjects [37.8%] – 12 mild, 2 moderate cases), hyperuricaemia (10/37 subjects [27.0%] – 9 
mild, 1 moderate case), headache (10/37 subjects [27.0%] – 10 mild cases), and arthralgia (8/37 
subjects [21.6%] – 6 mild, 2 moderate cases). 
The incidence of on treatment TEAEs per 100 patient-days IMP exposure was 5.2 for group 1 (12-17 
years of age), 2.4 for group 2 (6-11 years of age), 2.1 for group 3 (3-5 years of age) and 2.5 in the 
youngest patient group 4 (0-2 years of age). 
In trial 233, potentially related TEAEs defined as those having a possible or definitive relationship to 
the IMP were reported for 9 subjects (24.3%). The most commonly reported potentially IMP-related 
TEAEs were prothrombin time prolonged (3/37 [8.1%] subjects), blood corticotrophin 
increased, liver function test increased, and butterfly rash (2/37 [5.4%] subjects for each).  
The number of patients with potentially IMP-related TEAEs was higher in younger age groups: 1 patient 
in group 1 and 2 (12-17 and 6-11 years of age, 14.3% and 16.7%, respectively), 2 patients in group 3 
(3-5 years of age, 25%) and 4 patients in group 4 (0-2 years of age, 33.3%). The 2 patients with 
severe IMP-related TEAEs were in group 4, one patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and 
one patient with bronchial hyperreactivity discussed in the next section on serious adverse events. 
In trial 232, of 37, 9 subjects (24.3%) experienced ≥ 1 TEAE that was related to the IMP; the most 
frequently reporting terms were diarrhoea (2 subjects [5.4%]) and ECG QT prolongation (2 
subjects [5.4%]). All IMP-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Adverse events of special interest – important potential and identified risks in the EU RMP 
QT interval prolongation is discussed in section on laboratory findings. 
Paraesthesia, Hypoaesthesia, and Tremor: There was a low occurrence of neurological symptoms 
in Trial 242-12-233. No SAEs were reported for paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, or tremor. Paraesthesia 
of mild intensity and not related to IMP was present in 1 subject (7.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 
years) and resolved. No subjects reported hypoaesthesia or tremor. 
Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia: No SAEs were reported for anxiety, depression, or insomnia. 
Depression of mild intensity was experienced by 1 subject (7.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years) and 
resolved. Mild insomnia was also reported by 1 subject (7.7%) in Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years) and 
resolved. Both events were not related to IMP. There were no reports of anxiety. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (Nausea, Vomiting, and Gastritis): There were no SAEs reported for 
nausea, vomiting, or gastritis. There were 7 events of vomiting experienced by 6 subjects (16.2%) 
total; 2 subjects each in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years) and Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years), and 1 subject 
each in Group 2 (6 - 11 years) and Group 4 (0 - 2 years). All events were mild and all but one were 
unrelated, and all but one resolved. Per the AE listing, 1 subject (2.7%) in Group 2 (6 - 11 years) had 
2 events of vomiting where 1 resolved and the event of intermittent vomiting did not resolve; and 
1 subject (2.7%) in Group 3 had 1 event of vomiting possibly related to IMP. There were no reports of 
nausea or gastritis. 
No incidence of Tinnitus or Blurred vision was reported in Trial 233. 
Hypokalaemia occurred infrequently: 1 subject (2.7%) in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years) experienced 3 
AEs of mild hypokalaemia which resolved and were unrelated to IMP. No SAEs were reported. 
Liver disorders: There were no SAEs of liver disorders. 
Reported potentially IMP-related TEAEs were prothrombin time prolonged (3/37 [8.1%] subjects, 1 
subject in Group 3 [ages 3 - 5 years] and 2 subjects in Group 4 [ages 0 - 2 years]); liver function 
test increased (2/37 [5.4%] subjects, 1 subject each in Group 3 [ages 3 - 5 years] and Group 4 
[ages 0 - 2 years]); alanine aminotransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased (1/37 
[2.7%] subject for each TEAE-in Group 3 [ages 3 - 5 years]); and coagulation time prolonged (1/37 
[2.7%] subject Group 4 [ages 0 - 2 years]). 
Reported TEAEs that were unrelated to IMP were prolonged activated partial thromboplastin (1/37 
[2.7%] subject in Group 1 [ages 12 - 17 years]), and liver function test increased (1/37 [2.7%] 
subject, 1 subject in Group 3 [ages 3 - 5 years]). 
All events were mild and resolved, and none resulted in discontinuation from the IMP or trial. In seven 
of eight children there was no action taken with delamanid, while in one case rechallenged with 
delamanid was negative. 
See section on laboratory findings. 
Cortisol level increased: There were no events of cortisol level increased in Trial 242-12-233. 
However, blood corticotrophin increased was reported overall in 3/37 (8.1%) subjects; assessed as 
potentially related to IMP (2/37 [5.4%] subjects, both in Group 3 [ages 3 - 5 years]) and assessed as 
not related to IMP (1/37 [2.7%] subject Group 4 [ages 0 - 2 years]). 
All events were mild and resolved, and none resulted in discontinuation from the IMP or trial.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
In trial 233, there were 8/37 (21.6%) subjects with serious TEAEs (5/12 [41.7%] subjects in Group 4 
[0 - 2 years group], 2/12 [16.7%] subjects in Group 3 [3 - 5 years group], and 1/6 [16.7%] subject in 
Group 2 [6 - 11 years group]). Serious TEAEs deemed possibly related or related by the investigator 
were immune thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchial hyperreactivity, both in group 4 patients. The 
company assessed immune thrombocytopenic purpura as not related as onset was 214 days after the 
last dose of delamanid. The company assessed the bronchial hyperreactivity as not related to 
delamanid due to subject’s underlying MDR-TB and medical history of reactive airway disease. 
All other serious TEAEs for these subjects, pneumonia, lethargy, lower respiratory tract infection, and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were judged as unlikely related or not related to IMP by the investigator. 
There were 2 deaths during the trial, one in Group 3 [3 - 5 years group] and one in Group 4 [0 - 2 
years group], neither fatal events were assessed as causally related to IMP by the investigator or the 
company, but related to the treated MDR-TB. 
Laboratory findings 
The assessment of clinical laboratory tests did not show any clinically relevant changes from baseline 
across all age groups or any significant effect of delamanid. Clinically significant laboratory test 
abnormalities for serum chemistry were reported for 3 subjects: 1 subject in Group 4 had an 
elevated potassium of 6.7 mEq/L at the Day 182 visit; 1 subject in Group 3 had an elevated uric acid 
of 12.5 mg/dL at the Day 56 visit; 1 subject in Group 1 had an elevated uric acid of 14.6 mg/dL at an 
unscheduled visit and a value of 12.9 mg/dL at the Day 56 visit. This subject also had a TEAE of mild, 
nonserious hyperuricemia. 
No subjects met the criteria for elevated liver enzymes and potential drug-induced liver injury. 
Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities for haematology were reported for 4 subjects: 1 
subject in Group 2 had an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) value of 22.4 sec at the Day 365 
visit; 2 subjects in Group 3 had an elevated PTT value of 29.1 sec at the Day 28 visit and a PTT value 
of 18.8 sec at the Day 182 visit, respectively. 1 subject in Group 4 had a low platelet count at the visit 
at day 365 and subsequent unscheduled visits. This subject had a serious TEAE of thrombocytopenia 
purpura at day 395 and day 520. 
There were no newly acquired clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities from baseline for 
urinalysis. 
Electrocardiogram – QT-interval prolongation 
In trial 232, 2 of 12 subjects (16.7%) aged 3 to 5 years experienced TEAEs related to ECGs; 1 subject 
experienced PR prolongation, QT prolongation, and presence of U wave and the other subject 
experienced QT prolongation. These incidences were reported as IMP-related TEAEs. In trial 233, there 
were no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation and no clinical signs were seen in conjunction with QTc 
abnormalities. 
In trial 232 – 10 days delamanid treatment -, new onset changes > 480 msec in QTcB were 
experienced by 3 of 37 subjects (8.1%) (3 of 12 subjects [25.0%] in Group 3). New onset changes > 
450 msec in QTcB were experienced by 15 of 37 subjects (40.5%) (2 of 7 subjects [28.5%] in Group 
1, 2 of 6 subjects [33.3%] in Group 2, 8 of 12 subjects [66.6%] in Group 3, and 3 of 12 subjects 
[25.0%] in Group 4). Changes of QTcB ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced by 19 of 37 subjects 
(51.3%) (2 of 7 subjects [28.5%] in Group 1, 1 of 6 subjects [16.6%] in Group 2, 9 of 12 subjects 
Assessment report

[75.0%] in Group 3, and 7 of 12 subjects [58.3%] in Group 4). Changes of QTcB > 60 msec were 
experienced by 1 of 37 subjects (2.7%) overall (1 of 12 subjects [8.3%] in Group 3). 
There were no new onset changes > 480 msec in QTcF. New onset changes > 450 msec in QTcF were 
experienced by 3 of 37 subjects (8.1%) (1 of 7 subjects [14.2%] in Group 1 and 2 of 12 subjects 
[16.6%] in Group 3). Changes of QTcF ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced by 9 of 37 subjects 
(24.3%) (1 of 7 subjects [14.2%] in Group 1, 5 of 12 subjects [41.6%] in Group 3, and 3 of 12 
subjects [25.0%] in Group 4). There were no changes > 60 msec in QTcF. 
New abnormal rhythm in ECG results were experienced by 30 of 37 subjects (81.0%) (4 of 7 subjects 
[57.1%] in Group 1, 5 of 6 subjects [83.3%] in Group 2, 10 of 12 subjects in Group 3 [83.3%], and 11 
of 12 subjects [91.6%] in Group 4). New conduction abnormalities in ECG results (23 of 37 subjects 
[62.1%]) were the most frequently reported changes in clinically significant abnormalities or ECG 
results. There were no new onset changes > 500 mec in QTcB or QTcF. 
In trial 233 – 6 months delamanid treatment, the effects of delamanid on QT interval prolongation in 
paediatric subjects with MDR-TB have been examined in 37 subjects aged 0 to 17 years in Trial 242-
12-233. In this trial, the QT effect is not beyond that seen in adult delamanid trials, and the changes in 
ECG findings were within acceptable limits and in line with ECG and QT changes known to be 
associated with adult delamanid use. No clinical signs were seen in conjunction with QTc abnormalities. 
There were no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation.  
In trial 233, clinically significant changes in QTcF were as follows: No new onset changes > 500 msec 
or > 480 msec in QTcF were experienced by any subjects. New onset changes > 450 msec in QTcF 
were experienced by 5/36 (13.9%) subjects. Changes of QTcF ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced 
by 22/36 (61.1%) subjects. Changes of QTcF > 60 msec were experienced by 2/36 (5.5%) subjects. 
Clinically significant changes in QT interval corrected by Bazett’s formula (QTcB) were as follows: No 
new onset changes > 500 msec in QTcB were experienced by any subjects. New onset changes > 480 
msec in QTcB were experienced by 3/36 (8.3%) subjects. New onset changes > 450 msec in QTcB 
were experienced by 22/36 (61.1%) subjects. Changes of QTcB ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced 
by 25/36 (69.4%) subjects. Changes of QTcB > 60 msec were experienced by 3/36 (8.3%) subjects. 
Safety in special populations 
One pregnancy was reported during the trial for a subject in Group 1 after the last dose of IMP and 
before the last dose of OBR. The subject gave birth to a male newborn via vaginal delivery. No 
malformations were noted in the newborn. The subject was not taking delamanid after delivery; thus, 
no events of drug use while breastfeeding were recorded. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects were discontinued due to TEAEs. 
Post marketing experience 
The Otsuka delamanid Compassionate Use Programme has 36 paediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age. 
From the cumulative post marketing data, within the paediatric population (≤ 17 years of age) there 
were 492 cumulative reported AEs that pertained to the following SOCs: injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications (182 events); investigations (52 events); gastrointestinal disorders (34 
events); psychiatric disorders (33 events); nervous system disorders (32 events); general disorders 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021

and administration site conditions (31 events); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (25 
events); infections and infestations (20 events); metabolism and nutrition disorders (17 events); blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (15 events); hepatobiliary disorders (12 events); skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (11 events); cardiac disorders (9 events); musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (5 events); eye disorders (4 events); endocrine disorders (2 events); renal 
and urinary disorders (2 events); surgical and medical procedures (2 events); vascular disorders (2 
events); reproductive system and breast disorders (1 event); immune system disorders (1 event). 
As per request, the MAH performed an additional analysis of post-marketing data related to the 
important identified and potential risks reported in the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) v.3.4, Part 
SVII.3.1, taking into consideration weight and delamanid dose in children with reported AEs. No AEs 
have been reported in children with weight ≤ 10 kg. 
For the important potential risk of liver disorders, 23 AEs in 14 cases were reported post-marketing; 
16 of these AEs were serious. In 11 of these cases, 2 co-suspect anti-TB drugs were administered. 
Given this high number and the imbalance seen in trial 233 for the reported potentially IMP-related 
TEAEs for liver disorders with a higher number of cases in the youngest age groups, the Applicant was 
asked to provide case reports and causality assessment of the three reported post marketing cases 
related to the important potential risk of liver disorders where nothing is mentioned about co-
suspected drugs. All three cases were reported in 16 and 17 years old underweight adolescent patients 
and were very likely confounded by underlying drug-resistant TB and malnutrition. Although 
concomitant anti-TB drugs were not reported as co-suspected medications, their role in the 
development of the hepatic adverse events cannot be neglected. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial 242-12-232 was a phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial that 
investigated the pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability of delamanid in 37 paediatric MDR-TB 
patients administered with food for 10 days to subjects ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were also 
on therapy with an optimized background regimen. 
Trial 242-12-233 (phase 2, open-label, multi-dose trial to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and 
efficacy of delamanid) is a 6-month extension to Trial 232. The trial has been completed. Data for 13 
patients aged 6-17 years has been analysed in a previous paediatric variation and data for paediatric 
population subset 0 to 5 years of age using a new dispersible tablet formulation is submitted with this 
variation. Both trials were in compliance with the PIP for delamanid. 
Current exposure in the paediatric population is very low and prohibits drawing clear conclusions on 
the clinical safety of delamanid in this population. 
All patients in trial 233 experienced TEAEs. 
The incidence of “on treatment TEAEs” per 100 subject days exposure is highest in the oldest group 
(5.1 for Group 1), and the incidence for Group 2 (2.4) and Group 3 (2.1) is comparable with Group 4 
(2.5) and the overall incidence (2.9) of “on treatment TEAEs” per 100 subject days exposure. The “on 
treatment TEAEs” per 100 subject days exposure were comparable for Weight Group ≤ 10 kg and > 10 
kg with an incidence of 3.4 and 2.8 respectively. The number of subjects with serious TEAEs were 
higher in age Group 4 as well as in Weight Group ≤ 10 kg. However, in each weight group only one 
SAE was assessed as causally related to delamanid by the investigator and as causally not related by 
the company. All other SAE were assessed as causally not related to delamanid. 
The number of patients with potentially IMP-related TEAEs was higher in younger age groups: 1 patient 
in group 1 and 2 (12-17 and 6-11 years of age, 14.3% and 16.7%, respectively), 2 patients in group 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 45/62 
 
 
 
 
(3-5 years of age, 25%) and 4 patients in group 4 (0-2 years of age, 33.3%). Given the low number of 
patients included with a body weight ≤10 kg and the low delamanid exposure in group 4 patients, no 
conclusions can be drawn from the data in the weight group ≤10 kg.  It is noted, however, that 
incidence of potentially drug-related TEAEs was slightly higher in group 3 patients than in group 1 and 
2 patients as well. This difference was mainly seen in the SOC investigations, for increased blood 
corticotrophin, increased liver enzymes and prothrombin time prolongation. There was an imbalance in 
the reporting of adverse events related to the important potential risk of liver disorders with all except 
one case reported in the youngest age groups 3 and 4, though all events were mild and resolved, and 
none resulted in discontinuation from the IMP or trial. The effect of other concomitantly given 
medication, such as albendazole and PZA should be taken into consideration. Other risk factors are 
malnutrition, hypothyroidism and the age of children in Group 4. The potential risk of liver disorders 
will be followed-up further as liver disorders and blood cortisol level increase are included as important 
potential risks in the RMP. 
The doses administered in group 4 (0-2 years of age) in the clinical trials (10 mg BID DPF > 10 kg and 
5 mg BID DPF >8 and ≤10 kg) are below the ones that are currently predicted to be needed (20-25 
mg BID) to obtain similar exposures as in the adult population. 
Consequently, plasma exposures achieved in all study patients <10 kg were considerably lower than 
the target exposure (median AUC 2740 ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 ng*hr/mL in adults). 
In trial 233, the 4 most frequently reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (14/37 subjects 
[37.8%] – 12 mild, 2 moderate cases), hyperuricaemia (10/37 subjects [27.0%] – 9 mild, 1 moderate 
case), headache (10/37 subjects [27.0%] – 10 mild cases), and arthralgia (8/37 subjects [21.6%] – 6 
mild, 2 moderate cases).  
In trial 232, a total of 126 TEAEs were reported by 31 of 37 subjects (83.8%). The most frequently 
reported TEAEs were vomiting (9 of 37 subjects [24.3%]) followed by hyperuricaemia (5 of 37 subjects 
[13.5%]), nausea (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), and toothache (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]). 
In trial 233, potentially IMP-related TEAEs were reported for 9 subjects (24.3%). The most commonly 
reported potentially IMP-related TEAEs were prothrombin time prolonged (3/37 [8.1%] subjects), 
blood corticotrophin increased, liver function test increased, and butterfly rash (2/37 [5.4%] subjects 
for each). The number of patients with potentially IMP-related TEAEs was higher in younger age 
groups: 1 patient in group 1 and 2 (12-17 and 6-11 years of age, 14.3% and 16.7%, respectively), 2 
patients in group 3 (3-5 years of age, 25%) and 4 patients in group 4 (0-2 years of age, 33.3%).  
In trial 232, of 37, 9 subjects (24.3%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 TEAE that was related to the IMP; the 
most frequently reporting terms were diarrhoea (2 subjects [5.4%]) and ECG QT prolongation (2 
subjects [5.4%]). 
In trial 233, there were 7 events of vomiting experienced by 6 subjects (16.2%) total; 2 subjects each 
in Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years) and Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years), and 1 subject each in Group 2 (6 - 11 
years) and Group 4 (0 - 2 years). All events were mild and all but one were unrelated, and all but one 
resolved. 
There were no SAEs of liver disorders. Potentially IMP-related TEAEs were reported in group 3 and 4 
only and involved prothrombin time prolonged, liver function test increased, alanine aminotransferase 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased and coagulation time prolonged. 
Significant laboratory test abnormalities for partial thromboplastin time were reported for 2 subjects in 
group 3 (one at Day 28 and one at Day 182) and 1 subject in group 2 at Day 365 visit (i.e. after 
delamanid treatment was stopped). One subject in group 4 had low platelet count at day 365 and 
subsequent unscheduled visits. This subject had a serious TEAE of thrombocytopenia purpura at day 
395 and day 520, assessed as possibly related to delamanid by the investigators, although 
Assessment report

Page 46/62 
 
 
 
 
confounding drugs have been administered and there was a prolonged latent period (first AE episode 
214 days after the delamanid stop date). 
There were no events of cortisol level increased in Trial 242-12-233. However, blood corticotrophin 
increased was reported overall in 2 patients in group 3 (assessed as potentially related to IMP) and 1 
subject Group 4. 
In trial 232, 2 of 12 subjects (16.7%) aged 3 to 5 years experienced TEAEs related to ECGs; 1 subject 
experienced PR prolongation, QT prolongation, and presence of U wave and the other subject 
experienced QT prolongation. These incidences were reported as IMP-related TEAEs. In trial 233, there 
were no SAEs or any AEs of QT prolongation. 
In trial 233, in age group 3 (3-5 years of age), half of the patients had a ΔQTcF increase between 30 
and 60 msec. The mean and median increase was above 10 msec at the first month of delamanid 
treatment. 
Also in the exposure response simulation for the QTc interval prolongation, an effect of delamanid 
administration on the QTc interval prolongation was shown. 
Therefore, as observed in the adult population, an increase in QTc interval is noted in the paediatric 
population.  
In trial 233, there were 8/37 (21.6%) subjects with serious TEAEs, 5 of these were subjects in Group 
4. Serious TEAEs deemed possibly related or related by the investigator were immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchial hyperreactivity. Both patients with severe IMP-related TEAEs 
were in group 4. The company assessed immune thrombocytopenic purpura as not related as onset 
was 214 days after the last dose of delamanid. The company assessed the bronchial hyperreactivity as 
not related to delamanid due to subject’s underlying MDR-TB and medical history of reactive airway 
disease. 
The observed laboratory test abnormalities of elevated levels of uric acid, elevated partial 
thromboplastin time and low platelet count are linked with adverse events reported in the adult 
population and included in the SmPC (thrombocytopenia, hyperuricaemia). 
Opposite to the AE of hypokalaemia reported in the adult population a case of hyperkalaemia was 
reported in the youngest paediatric patient group. Based on the very low exposure of delamanid in this 
age group and a number of other anti-TB agents in the regimen, causality for delamanid is unlikely. 
For the important potential risk of liver disorders, 23 AEs in 14 cases were reported post-marketing; 
16 of these AEs were serious. For most of these patients administered doses were above the newly 
recommended ones achieving exposure similar to adults. In 11 of these cases, 2 co-suspect anti-TB 
drugs were administered. Given this high number and the imbalance seen in trial 233 for the reported 
potentially IMP-related TEAEs for liver disorders with a higher number of cases in the youngest age 
groups, the Applicant was asked to provide case reports and causality assessment of the three 
reported postmarketing cases related to the important potential risk of liver disorders where nothing 
was mentioned about co-suspected drugs. All three cases were reported in 16 and 17 years old 
underweight adolescent patients and were very likely confounded by underlying drug-resistant TB and 
malnutrition. Although concomitant anti-TB drugs were not reported as co-suspected medications, their 
role in the development of the hepatic adverse events cannot be neglected. 
For children with a body weight < 10 kg, administration of delamanid is currently not recommended. In 
group 4 in trial 232, 5 patients with a body weight below 10 kg at baseline have been included). In 
group 4 of trial 233, 4 patients still had a body weight below 10 kg at baseline). A patient under 2 
years old with a BW under 10 kg died shortly after starting delamanid treatment in trial 233; this 
patient had developmental parameters below the 3rd percentile at baseline and it was determined that 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 47/62 
 
 
 
 
the death was not related to delamanid treatment. In addition, all 5 children were assigned to Group 4, 
and delamanid doses (5 mg BID >8kg and ≤10 kg or 5 mg QD ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤8 kg) administered in 
the trials resulted in plasma exposure essentially lower than the targeted effective adult exposure. 
Exposure in these patients was indeed below the targeted effective adult exposure (median AUC 2740 
ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 ng*hr/mL in adults) and the model estimates that a 4-5 times 
higher dose would be needed in this population. Delamanid’s safety profile has therefore not been 
investigated for the model estimated therapeutic dose (20-25 mg BID) for this weight group < 10 kg. 
Based on the above arguments (only 5 children with a body weight below 10 kg and a lower plasma 
exposure tested in the study in these children than the targeted effective adult exposure), 
administration of delamanid is currently not recommended in children with a body weight < 10 kg. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP concluded that the observed safety data collected from trial 232 and 233 are consistent with 
the known safety profile of delamanid in adult subjects and no new safety signals have been identified.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that all studies, which are contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan, P/0271/2019 have been completed after 26 January 2007, are considered as significant. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets. The bridging report 
submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Deltyba (delamanid) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. In addition, Deltyba was granted a conditional 
marketing authorisation as per Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
It is estimated that 3.6% of the tuberculosis (TB) cases worldwide are multidrug-resistant (MDR); ie, 
resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. Childhood TB comprises approximately 10% to 15% of the global 
TB disease burden, with higher rates in developing countries. Based on estimates of total MDR-TB 
cases this translates to a minimum global estimate of approximately 40 000 paediatric cases of MDR-
TB per year. 
Differences in the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of TB in children make diagnosis more 
challenging in children than in adults and definitions of latent infection and active disease are not as 
clear. Children are also at a much higher risk of progression to active disease than adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 55/62 
 
 
 
 
Microbiological confirmation is often not available due to the paucibacillary nature of disease and the 
difficulty of specimen collection (especially sputum) in younger children. The diagnosis usually relies on 
nonspecific clinical and radiologic signs, as well as a history of exposure (ie, close contact with a TB 
case). Fever (possibly intermittent or low grade), weight loss or failure to thrive, and persistent cough 
for > 2 weeks are the most important clinical signs for pulmonary TB. 
Children are diagnosed with either confirmed or presumed MDR-TB. Confirmed disease occurs when an 
organism is isolated from the child and is shown either genotypically or phenotypically to be resistant 
to isoniazid and rifampicin. Presumed disease occurs when TB is diagnosed in combination with either 
known contact with an MDR-TB case or after failure of appropriate first-line therapy when adherence 
has been verified. Incident cases of childhood TB reflect recent transmission, which implies that drug 
resistance patterns observed among paediatric TB cases reflect primary (transmitted) drug resistance 
within the community. 
If a child presenting with TB is a known contact of an adult with MDR pulmonary TB, the child is a 
probable MDR-TB case and should be managed accordingly. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of drug-resistant TB is long, expensive and associated with frequent adverse events. In 
children, treatment is further complicated by limited data on appropriate dosing and safety, and a lack 
of child-friendly formulations. New anti-TB drugs are urgently needed to improve treatment tolerability 
and outcome, particularly for MDR-TB cases with additional second-line drug resistance, for whom 
identifying at least four active drugs is difficult with the current armamentarium of drugs. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Trial 242-12-232 was a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial that 
investigated the pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability of delamanid in 37 paediatric MDR-TB 
patients administered with food for 10 days to subjects ages birth to 17 years, inclusive, who were also 
on therapy with an optimized background regimen. 
Trial 242-12-233 is a phase II, open-label, non-comparative, multi-dose trial to assess the safety, 
tolerability, PK and efficacy of delamanid and is a 6-month extension to Trial 232. Delamanid is added 
to OBR for 6 months. Patients safety, efficacy and PK are followed until 8 weeks after the last 
delamanid dose. There is a visit at 6 months after the last delamanid dose for safety and efficacy 
evaluation and an additional treatment outcome follow-up one year after this last follow-up visit. The 
trial had been completed and data analysed for age groups 6-17 years (13 patients) leading to an 
extension of the indication in adolescents and children with a body weight of 30 kg. This trial has now 
been completed for the subset 0 to 5 years of age. 
The dispersible tablet formulation (DPF) of delamanid was used for the younger age groups in Trial 
242-12-232 and 242-12-233. Twelve children aged 3-5 years (group 3) were administered DPF 25 mg 
BID + OBR and the twelve patients in aged 0 – 2 years (group 4) were administered a DPF dose based 
on body weight + OBR: Subjects > 10 kg received DPF 10 mg BID + OBR,   Subjects > 8 and ≤ 10 kg 
received DPF 5 mg BID + OBR and Subjects ≤ 8 kg received DPF 5 mg once daily + OBR. 
Relative bioavailability was conducted to compare the dispersible tablet formulation for paediatric 
subjects with the marketed tablet formulation and to determine the effect of a high-fat meal on 
delamanid PK (Trial 242-12-245).

A population PK model was developed for delamanid in the paediatric population with the data 
collected in Trials 232 and 233 in order to define the dose in the paediatric patients. (CSR 242-19-259) 
The results of trial 232 have been submitted previously during procedure EMA/H/C/002552/P46/007. 
Part of the results of trial 233, namely the subgroup of children aged 6 to 17 years who had completed 
the trial and follow-up period, have been submitted in a previous variation EMEA/H/C/002552/II/0040 
and lead to an extension of the indications from adults to adults, adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 30 kg. 
The results of trial 233 for the two youngest age groups (0-5 years of age) are submitted in this line 
extension procedure. The aim of this variation is to provide a justification for extension of the 
delamanid MDR-TB indication to children and infants with a body weight of at least 10 kg. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Deltyba has a conditional marketing authorisation, obtained on 28 April 2014, for use as part of an 
appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult 
patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance 
or tolerability. The extension of this indication from adults to adolescents and children with a body 
weight of at least 30 kg was granted in October 2020. 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children of 0 to 5 y, 
assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response to delamanid. 
The DPF doses used in group 3 (3-5 years) were 25 mg BID and in group 4 (0-2 years) 10 mg BID for 
patients > 10 kg, 5 mg BID for patients >8 and ≤ 10 kg. All patients in group 3 had a body weight 
between 10 and 20.5 kg at baseline. Therefore, the recommended doses identified by simulation, 25 
mg BID for patients 10-20 kg corresponds with the one used in group 3 during trial 233. In group 4, 
the recommended dose identified by simulation would also be 20-25 mg BID. 
The use of delamanid in addition to OBR in paediatric trial 233 resulted in a favourable treatment 
outcome in 10 of the 12 subjects (83.3%) aged 3 to 5 years at 24 months (3 of these 12 subjects 
(25.0%) were cured and 7 of the 12 subjects (58.3%) completed treatment) and in a favourable 
treatment outcome in 11 of the 12 subjects (91.7%) aged 0-2 years (5 of these (41.7%) were cured 
and 6 of the 12 subjects (50.0%) completed treatment). 
The majority of the subjects in Groups 3 and 4 found the paediatric formulation to be highly palatable. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
PK 
In children 0-2 years median AUC (2740 ng*hr/mL) was below the 7500 ng*hr/mL AUC in adults. 
100 mg of Delamanid Paediatric Formulation (DPF) is not bioequivalent to 100 mg of Delamanid 
Tablets with respect to rate and extent of absorption. 
In the bioavailability conducted in adults, systemic exposure was greater when delamanid was taken 
with a high-fat meal. 
PopPK 
Comparable AUCss and Cmax values are displayed for the recommended paediatric and the adult doses. 
The methodology used to generate these plots/results were well-described and the codes used were 
provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 57/62 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy 
Based on the current conclusions of the popPK simulation, the proposed doses are different from the 
ones used in trial 232 and 233 for patients in group 4 aged 0-2 years.  Plasma exposures achieved in 
all study patients <10 kg were considerably lower than the target exposure (median AUC 2740 
ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 ng*hr/mL in adults). Therefore, administration of delamanid 
has not been sufficiently investigated in children with a body weight < 10 kg. 
Evaluation of efficacy is complicated by the more difficult diagnosis in younger patients. Both cured 
patients and patients with completed treatment were considered as having a favourable treatment 
outcome. Even though patients in group 4 were administered suboptimal doses in combination with an 
OBR, a favourable treatment outcome was noted in 11 of the 12 subjects (91.7%) aged 0-2 years (5 of 
these (41.7%) were cured and 6 of the 12 subjects (50.0%) completed treatment). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data from these trials are consistent with the known safety profile of delamanid in adult 
subjects and no new safety signals have been identified. 
In trial 233, the most commonly reported potentially IMP-related TEAEs were prothrombin time 
prolonged (3/37 [8.1%] subjects), blood corticotrophin increased, liver function test increased, and 
butterfly rash (2/37 [5.4%] subjects for each). In trial 232 this were diarrhoea (2 subjects [5.4%]) 
and ECG QT prolongation (2 subjects [5.4%]). 
In trial 233, changes of QTcF ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced by 81.8% of patients in group 4 
and by 50.0% of patients in group 3. Changes of QTcF > 60 msec were experienced by 1 subject in 
group 4. Though, no new onset changes > 450 msec in QTcF were experienced in group 3 and 4 
patients. In trial 232, changes of QTcF ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 msec were experienced by 41.6% in Group 3 
25.0% of patients in Group 4. New onset changes > 450 msec in QTcF were experienced 16.6% in 
Group 3. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Current exposure in the paediatric population is very low and prohibits drawing clear conclusions on 
the clinical safety of delamanid in this population. 
The number of patients with potentially IMP-related TEAEs was higher in younger age groups: 1 patient 
in group 1 and 2 (12-17 and 6-11 years of age, 14.3% and 16.7%, respectively), 2 patients in group 3 
(3-5 years of age, 25%) and 4 patients in group 4 (0-2 years of age, 33.3%). Given the low number of 
patients included with a body weight ≤10 kg and the low delamanid exposure in group 4 patients, no 
conclusions can be drawn from the data in the weight group ≤10 kg.  It is noted, however, that 
incidence of potentially drug-related TEAEs was slightly higher in group 3 patients than in group 1 and 
2 patients as well. This difference was mainly seen in the SOC investigations, for increased blood 
corticotrophin, increased liver enzymes and prothrombin time prolongation. There is an imbalance in 
the reporting of adverse events related to the important potential risk of liver disorders with all except 
one case reported in the youngest age groups 3 and 4, though all events were mild and resolved, and 
none resulted in discontinuation from the IMP or trial. This will be followed-up further as liver disorders 
and blood cortisol level increase are included as important potential risks in the RMP. 
The doses administered in group 4 (0-2 years of age) in the clinical trials (10 mg BID DPF > 10 kg and 
5 mg BID DPF >8 and ≤10 kg) are below the ones that are currently predicted to be needed (20-25 
mg BID) to obtain similar exposures as in the adult population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 58/62 
 
 
 
 
Consequently, plasma exposures achieved in all study patients <10 kg were considerably lower than 
the target exposure (median AUC 2740 ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 ng*hr/mL in adults). 
The available safety data in patients <10kg are therefore not sufficiently informative to support an 
extension of the lower weight limit. 
As observed in the adult population, an increase in QTc interval is noted in the paediatric population. 
Also in the exposure response simulation for the QTc interval prolongation, an effect of delamanid 
administration on the QTc interval prolongation was shown, both in the adult and the paediatric 
population. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions from the efficacy evaluation. 
Based on the assumption that the response to treatment in the paediatric population is comparable to 
the adult population based on similar exposure, approval of the indication is dependent on the 
appropriateness of the age-specific dose regimens based on PK data and on an acceptable paediatric 
safety profile. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A population PK modelling approach was used to inform doses to be used in children from birth to 5 
years of age (included), assuming that similar PK exposure as in adults should lead to similar response 
to delamanid. 
The safety risk in children from birth to 5 years of age (included) enrolled in the trials seems to be 
consistent with what was observed in adults and no new safety signals have been identified.  
For children with a body weight < 10 kg, administration of delamanid is not recommended. In group 4 
in trial 232, 5 patients with a body weight below 10 kg at baseline have been included). In group 4 of 
trial 233, 4 patients still had a body weight below 10 kg at baseline). A patient under 2 years old with 
a BW under 10 kg died shortly after starting delamanid treatment in trial 233; this patient had 
developmental parameters below the 3rd percentile at baseline and it was determined that the death 
was not related to delamanid treatment.  Therefore, data for model validation in these patients is 
limited. In addition, all 5 children were assigned to Group 4, and delamanid doses (5 mg BID >8kg and 
≤10 kg or 5 mg QD ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤8 kg) administered in the trials resulted in plasma exposure 
essentially lower than the targeted effective adult exposure. Exposure in these patients was indeed 
below the targeted effective adult exposure (median AUC 2740 ng*hr/mL in children 0-2 years vs 7500 
ng*hr/mL in adults) and the model estimates that a 4-5 times higher dose would be needed in this 
population. Delamanid’s safety profile has therefore not been investigated for the model estimated 
therapeutic dose (20-25 mg BID) for this weight group. 
Based on the above arguments (limited number of children with a body weight below 10 kg and a 
lower plasma exposure tested in the study in these children than the targeted effective adult 
exposure), administration of delamanid is currently not recommended in children with a body weight 
< 10 kg.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Deltyba is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Deltyba 25 mg is not similar to Sirturo, Granupas and 
Dovprela (previously Pretomanid FGK) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Deltyba 25 mg dispersible tablets is favourable in the 
following indication: 
•  Use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-drug resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children and infants with a body weight of at 
least 10 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of 
resistance or tolerability. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Deltyba subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
Assessment report  
EMA/543612/2021  
Page 60/62 
 
 
 
 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Additional risk minimisation measures as per Annex II D of Deltyba Product Information: Conditions or 
Restrictions about the safe and effective use of the medicinal product include educational material for 
healthcare providers (HCPs) and for patients. 
Objectives of:  
Educational materials for HCPs:  
• To inform the health care professionals about the appropriate usage and to minimize potentially 
associated risks from use of delamanid and  
• To inform HCPs that delamanid should be used according to WHO/National guidelines for MDR TB 
management.  
Educational materials for Patients: 
 • To reinforce and/or supplement the information provided in the patient information leaflet. 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:  
The educational materials for HCPs reinforce and supplement the EU SmPC information on the 
following safety/efficacy concerns in order to ensure the safe and effective use of delamanid: important 
identified risk of QT Interval Prolongation, important potential risks of Drug Use during Pregnancy and 
Drug Use during Breastfeeding, and the efficacy risk of Drug Resistance. Information for Patients 
addresses important potential risks of Drug Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
In order to further investigate the use of delamanid in different combination 
treatment regimens as well as safety, the MAH should submit the results of the 
endTB (Evaluating Newly approved Drugs for multidrug-resistant TB) study, a 
randomized, controlled Phase III trial in adults and adolescents with multi-drug-
resistant tuberculosis conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières, including an 
additional analysis of the data with a focus on the evaluation of delamanid based on 
an agreed statistical analysis plan.

the currently approved indications for complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), complicated urinary 
tract  infection  (cUTI)  and  hospital-acquired  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia 
(HAP/VAP)) for Zavicefta; as a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to 
add this indication and the posology. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.1. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0340/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Although the current indication 
bacteraemia is not specifically mentioned in the PIP, the relevant data in this application are based on the  
studies in this  PIP. 
At the time of submission of  the application, the PIP EMEA-001313-PIP01-12-M08 was not yet completed  
as some measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No  
847/2000,  the  MAH  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised  
orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a  condition 
related to  the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not  seek Scientific Advice at  the CHMP.

Bacteraemia  due  to  Gram-negative  pathogens  is  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and  mortality. 
Nearly 2 million episodes of bloodstream infection in North America and Europe annually led to ~250,000 
deaths and nearly half of community-acquired and one third of healthcare associated cases were caused 
by  Gram-negative  bacteria.  Infections  associated  with  bacteraemia  may  be  severe,  require 
hospitalisation and have the potential  to be life-threatening. Bacteraemia due to resistant pathogens is  
increasing  in  frequency  and  associated  with  more  adverse  effects.  Prompt  administration  of  effective 
antibiotics  is therefore critical for a favorable outcome. 
Zavicefta  -  Ceftazidime-avibactam  (CAZ-AVI)  -  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  that  has  been 
developed as an intravenously administered compound for treatment of patients with infections caused 
by Gram-negative pathogens, including  pathogens that are resistant to  ceftazidime. 
Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin that has been approved for many years in several member states. As a 
result  from  an  Article  30  referral  procedure  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006,  EC  decision  date  13/01/2011) 
ceftazidime  (brand  leader  Fortum)  was  approved  for  the  following  indications:  the  treatment  of 
complicated  intra-abdominal  infection  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary  tract  infection  (cUTI),  nosocomial 
pneumonia (NP), including  treatment of patients  with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is  
suspected to be associated with, any of the infections listed above. In addition, a range of other infections 
were also approved in the referral procedure, however these are not mentioned here. Ceftazidime has no 
noticeable  antibacterial  activity  against  Gram-positive  pathogens,  with  the  exception  of  some 
streptococci, or anaerobes.

Avibactam is a novel non-betalactam-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of beta-lactamases of class A 
and  class  C,  including  ESBLs  and  serine-based  carbapenemases  (KPCs).  It  also  inhibits  class  D 
beta-lactamases  (e.g.  OXA-48  type  carbapenemase).  Avibactam  has  no  inhibitory  effect  on  class  B 
metallo-beta-lactamases. 
CAZ-AVI is currently approved for use in EU, under the trade name Zavicefta, for the treatment of adults 
with  cIAI,  cUTI  including  pyelonephritis,  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  (HAP)  including  ventilator 
associated  pneumonia  (VAP),  and  infections  due  to aerobic Gram-negative  organisms  in  patients  with 
limited treatment  options. Zavicefta was first  made commercially available in the  EU in 2016.   
Zavicefta is currently only approved for adults, however, a Type II variation to extend the indication of  
Zavicefta to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years for the treatment of cIAI and 
cUTI is ongoing at the time of the adoption of this assessment report (EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0015).   
This  Type  II  variation  concerns  an extension  of  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  bacteraemia  (in 
association with, or suspected to be associated with, the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and 
HAP/VAP) in Section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
The clinical development program for CAZ-AVI included patients with bacteraemia at baseline in all of the  
5 completed Phase 3 studies that were conducted to support the currently approved indications of cIAI, 
cUTI  and  HAP/VAP  (this  includes  also  the  indication  related  to  aerobic  Gram-negative  organisms  in 
patients with lim ited treatment options). A brief overview of these studies are presented in Table 1 below. 
No new studies have been submitted for the current application.  
This  Type  II  variation  for  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  bacteraemia  (in 
association with, or suspected to be associated with, the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and 
HAP/VAP) is based on:  
• 
Post-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety data from the sub-group of patients who had bacteraemia 
at baseline across these 5 studies mentioned above.  
•  Relevant post-marketing (PM) safety data.   
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  this  proposed  indication  extension  for  the  addition  of  bacteraemia 
associated  with  the  currently  approved  indication  in  adults  is  mainly  based  on  post-hoc  analysis  of 
efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the  sub-group  of  patients  who   had  bacteraemia  at  baseline  across  the 
previously  assessed  5  Phase  3  studies.  These  studies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE, 
REPROVE) were conducted to support the currently approved indications of cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP. No 
new  documentation  to  support  the  indication  extension  to  include  bacteraemia  was  submitted.  The  
Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) s tates the following  regarding non-pathogen-specific bacteraemia: 
„It  may  be  possible  to  accumulate  sufficient  clinical  data  to   support  an  indica tion  for  use  of  an 
antibacterial agent in the treatment of bacteraemia that is associated with specific types of infection, with 
or without restriction to certain pathogens. For example, in the case of agents that have been in use for 
many years and are indicated for use in a broad range of infections the to tal evidence may be considered 
sufficient for an indication that reads: Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association 
with, or is suspected to be associated with, any of the infections listed above (i.e. referring to the list of 
indications approved). If the antibacterial agent has been evaluated in several indications and the total 
number of bacteraemic patients treated across these indications is deemed sufficient (e.g. ~50 or more) 
to support a conclusion  that efficacy is comparable to that in other patients or, at least, comparable to 
that  of other treatments,  then the addition of the sentence could be considered appropriate.”

EMA/437085/2020

The MAH’s approach is therefore considered acceptable and in line with the current AB-guideline as well 
as  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP-decisions  for  older  antibiotics  tha t  have  been  going  through  referral 
harmonisations, e.g. ceftazidime (Article 30 referral procedure, EMEA/H/A-30/001006).    
Of main importance when evaluating this extension of the indication for Zavicefta is the fact that during 
the  aforementioned  Article  30  procedure  of  ceftazidime  in  2011  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006),  treatment  of  
patients  with  bacteraemia  in  association  with,  or  suspected  to  be  associated  with,  the  approved  adult 
indications  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infection  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary  tract  infection  (cUTI) 
and  hospital-acquired  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  (HAP/VAP)  was  added  to 
the  EU  SmPC  of  ceftazidime. The  additional  data  submitted  for  the  Fixed  Dose  Combination  Zavicefta, 
which is further described below, are merely supplementary. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
This  Type  II  variation  concerns  an  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  bacteraemia  in 
adults associated with, or suspected to be associated with, the currently approved indications cIAI, cUTI 
and HAP/VAP. No new non-clinical data have been submitted with this application, which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. In view of  that  the proposed posology and route of administration in pa tients  
with  bacteraemia  are  identical  as  for  the  approved  indications,  update  of  the  initial  non-clinical  safety 
assessment is not warranted. 
Non-clinical data within previous submissions of MAA for Zavicefta reveal no special hazard for humans 
based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety  pharmacology,  repeated  dose  toxicity,  reproduction  toxicity  or 
genotoxicity.  Carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been conducted with  ceftazidime  and  avibactam,  which 
was considered acceptable by the  CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Introduction 
 Zavicefta is indicated for the treatment  of the following infections in adults; 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection  (cIAI) 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including  pyelonephritis 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
• 
Treatment  of  infections  due  to  aerobic  Gram-negative  organisms  in adult  patients  with  limited  
treatment options. 
The current indication extension seeks to include ‘treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in 
association with,  or is suspected to  be associated with,  any of the  infections listed above’. 
The active ingredients in Zavicefta are ceftazidime and avibactam. The recommended dosage of Zavicefta 
for patients with estimated creatinine clearance ≥51 mL/min is 1 vial containing 2000 mg ceftazidime and 
500 mg avibactam administered by intravenous (IV) infusion. Treatment will be repeated every 8 hours, 
i.e. a maximum of 3 vials per 24-hour period. Hence, the maximum daily dose is 6000 mg/day and 1500 
mg/day of ceftazidime and avibactam, respectively. Treatment duration is normally from 5 to 14  days. 
For the paediatric population, the recommended maximum dosage is similar to the adult  population. 
Zavicefta was first approved in Europe in 2016. In 2019, an application for extension of the indication to 
include paediatric use for the indications cIAI and cUTI was submitted, which was pending at the time of 
adoption of this AR.

The environmental risk assessment (ERA) is divided into an ERA for ceftazidime (Phase I and Phase II: 
Tier A and Tier B) and an ERA for avibactam (Phase I and Phase II: Tier A and B). 
Ceftazidime 
PEC calculation ceftazidime 
The Fpen of ceftazidime is refined by taking into account the consumption data of ceftazidime in Italy in 
2016  (4268 kg), a maximum daily dose of 6000 and a population in Italy in 2016  of 59,290,969:

2016-17 point prevalence survey, approximately 5.5% of patients in the EU were diagnosed with a t least 
one healthcare associated infection (HAI) during 2016-2017. This ECDC data estimates the total annual 
number of people acquiring one HAI is about 3.8 million. The same survey reported 10.8% of HAIs across 
the EU  countries are attributed  to blood stream infections or bacteraemia.  
Therefore, 
the  EU  prevalence 
(Fpen) 
for  bacteremia  may  be  determined  as 
follows:
In  addition,  the  MAH  has  used US  hospital  data  (Op tum  de-identified  Electronic  Health  Record  (EHR) 
dataset 2007-2019) to recalculate the daily dose consumed per inhabitant, in order to cover the possible  
scenario that a patient could receive more than one course of treatment per year. EHR data includes more 
than 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in US and show tha t approximately 15% of patients receive more than 
Assessment report

one  course  of  treatment  within  a  12  month  period.  There  are  no  similar  European  data  available.  The 
revised Doseai is thus 267.7  mg/day for ceftazidime, and 66.2  mg/day for avibactam. 
The refined PECsw value is above the threshold of 0.01 µg/L,  and a Phase II assessment is provided.  
Phase  II Tier A, ceftazidime  
The Phase II Tier A assessment for ceftazidime was assessed during the initial marketing authorisation 
procedure.

For the calculation of the PNEC of all three compartments, an assessment factor (AF) of 10 is used. 
The risk quotient (RQ) for all compartments are under the action limit (table 1), therefore a Tier B is not 
triggered.  However,  in  the  water-sediment  study  greater  than  10%  of  the  applied  radioactivity  was 
associated  with  the  sediment  phase,  therefore  the  effect  of  ceftazidime  on  the  sediment  dwelling 
organism Chironomus riparius was investigated in Tier B. 
Phase  II Tier B,  ceftazidime 
The Tier B study on sediment-water toxicity in Chironomids has been assessed previously: LOEC (28d) 
>100 mg/kg dw, NOEC 100 mg/kg dw, recalculated to standard sediment: NOECstandard sediment 303 mg/kg, 
and using an AF of 10, results in a PNEC of 3030 µg/kg. 
The RQsediment is 0.00043, which is under the action limit  of 1  and no further testing  is required.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  study  on  ceftazidime  transformation  in  water/sediment  systems  (OECD 
308) shows that both main transformation products M1 and M3 are very persistent considering the DT50 
values  of  101.0  d  and  118.0  d  at  20°C  for  M1  and  M3,  respectively  in  water/sediment.  Criteria  for 
classification as PBT or vPvB are, however, not  met (not B or T).

Phase  II Tier B,  avibactam 
The Tier B study on sediment-water toxicity in Chironomids has been assessed previously: LOEC (28d) 
>300  mg/kg  dw,  NOEC  300  mg/kg  dw,  recalculated  to  standard  sediment:  NOECstandard  sediment  1111 
mg/kg, and using an AF of 100,  results in a PNEC of 11,110 µg/kg. 
The RQsediment is 0.000012, which is under the action limit  of 1 and no further testing  is required.  
Consumption based refinement of Fpen values was considered acceptable by CHMP as part of the ongoing 
extension of indication procedure to include the paediatric population (Zavicefta Module 1.6.1 ERA dated 
23  October  2019).  In  addition,  the  MAH  refined  Doseai  for  ceftazidime  and  avibactam  to  reflect  the 
possibility of patients receiving more than one course of treatment per year, in line with the CHMP request 
made during this assessment. The source for data and the estimate is considered appropriate to use for 
PEC calculation. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH did not propose any changes to section 4.6 (Fertility, pregnancy and lactation) or 5.3 (Preclinical 
safety data) of the SmPC, or in corresponding parts of the PL. This is considered adequate and acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of the proposed extension of indication from a non-clinical point of  
view. 
Ceftazidime and avibactam as combined in the product Zavicefta are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new clinical pharmacology data was submitted for this extension of  indication variation. This however 
was acceptable to the CHMP as a previously submitted population PK, PK/PD and PK/PD target attainment 
analyses  report,  CAZ-MS-09,  was  used  to  justify  the  posology  in  patients  with  bacteraemia.  Refer  to 
Section 2.3.4 on PK/PD modelling for discussion on the topic.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
• 
• 
The ceftazidime (CAZ) dataset comprised 9155 observations from 1975 individuals, including 86 
(4.4%)  healthy  volunteers,  696  (35.2%)  c UTI  patients,  781  (39.5%)  cIAI  patients  and  412 
(20.9%)  with  HAP/VAP.  
The avibactam (AVI) dataset included 13735 observations from 2249 individuals, including  345 
(15.3%)  healthy  volunteers,  705  (31.3%)  cUTI  patients,  786  (34.9%)  cIAI  patients  and  413 
(18.4%)  with  HAP/VAP.  
There is a difference between the number of Phase 3 patients in the two da tasets (n=1747 CAZ, n=1762 
AVI)  because  16  patients  did  not  have  CAZ  concentrations  and  one  did  no t  have  AVI  concentrations 
available. 
The  PK  data  for  each  analyte  were  well  described  by  2-compartment  PK  models  with  first-order 
disposition  and  elimination.  Of  the  covariates  evaluated  (including  CrCL,  age,  body  weight,  sex, race, 
indication and geographic region) only CrCL had sufficiently large effects on exposures to warrant dose 
adjustment  and  only  for  patients  with  CrCL<50  mL/min.  The  CL  of  CAZ  and  AVI  were  correlated  with 
CrCL. The relationship was close to proportional at CrCL <100 mL/min. Above this level, CL was found to 
increase slowly with increasing CrCL, such that an increase of 100 mL/min in CrCL led to a 27.9% increase 
in AVI CL and a 12.5% increase in CAZ CL. 
The  final  POPPK  models  included  a  number  of  other  covariate  effects  that  did  not  warrant  dose  
adjustment.  Typically,  covariate  effects  were  retained  in  the  final  models  if  the  associated  impact  on 
Assessment report

either CL or Vc was on the order of ± 20%.  However, in some instances, covariate effects with smaller 
magnitudes were retained for informational purposes as deemed appropriate.  
Individual Etas for CL and VC, stratified by bacteraemia status, for the CAZ model are presented in Figure  
1 and Figure 2, respectively. Etas for CL and Vc for the AVI model are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
respectively.

The final POPPK models performed well on visual predictive testing (pcVPC) in subgroups such as patients 
with  high and low CrCL, obese patients and elderly patients (figures not shown here).  
Exposure  and  joint  probability  of  target  attainment  defined  as  the  probability  of PK/pharmacodynamic 
(PD) target attainment for  the joint PK/PD targets of free CAZ concentrations that exceed the CAZ-AVI 
minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  for  50%  of  the  dosing  interval,  denoted  50%fT  >  MIC,  and 
simultaneously, free AVI concentrations that exceed the threshold concentration (CT) of 1 mg/L for 50%fT 
>  CT  were  comparable  among  patients  with  and  without  baseline  bacteraemia.  The  joint  probability  of 
PK/PD  target  attainment  at  CAZ-AVI  MIC=8  mg/L  were  >98%  in  patients  with  and  without  concurrent 
bacteraemia (Table 4).

The CHMP noted that the CAZ-MS-09 study report was submitted as part of a previous type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/4027/II/002).  The presented models in  the report were assessed as part of that procedure. 
The  PK/PD  modelling  presented  in CAZ-09-MS  report  was  not  conducted specifically  to  investigate  the 
impact  of  bacteraemia  on  CAZ  and  AVI  exposure.  This  has  led  to  some  limitations  in  the  presented 
analyses:  
-  Bacteraemia  status  is  not  included  in  the  tables  describing  the  baseline  demographics  in  subjects 
included  in  the  CAZ-  and  AVI  models  (Table  5  and  Table  9  in  CAZ-09-MS).  This  has  led  to   some 
uncertainty regarding the bacteraemia status in the patients included in the exposure/target attainment 
analyses. In Table 4, there are n=88 patients with s tatus “yes” and n=1465  with  “no”. Conflictingly, as  
shown in the Eta plots in e.g. Figure 1, there were n=65 patients with bacteraemia status “yes”, n=347 
with sta tus “no” and  n=1563 with status  “missing”. In addition, there is also a discrepancy in the number 
of patients with bacteraemia status “yes”, with n=88 in the exposure/target attainment analyses versus 
n=65/66/67  in  the eta plots.  
-  The  report  did  not  contain  diagnostic  plots  (pcVPCs)  confirming  that  the  models  predicted  exposure 
adequately across bacteraemia status.  
The  above-mentioned  issues  were  however  not  further  pursued,  since  bacteraemia  status  had  no 
apparent  effect  on  the  CL  or  Vc  for  neither  CAZ  nor  AVI,  as  shown  in Figure  1,  Figure  2,  Figure  3  and 
Figure  4.  These  plots  are  considered  sufficiently  reliable  due  to  the  low  parameter  shrinkage  for  CL 
(<12%)  and  moderate  shrinkage  for  Vc  (28-31%).  There  was  no  apparent  difference  in  Cmax,ss  or 
AUCss,0-24 of CAZ and AVI between patients with and without bacteraemia. The joint target attainment of 
CAZ and AVI was also comparable in patients with and without bacteraemia. Finally, bacteraemia per se 
is not expected to influence pharmacokinetic processes.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No  new  clinical  pharmacology  data  were  submitted.  This  however  was  acceptable  to  the  CHMP  as  the 
posology  is  supported  by  a  previously  submitted  modelling  report  (CAZ-09-MS),  which  indicated  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 18/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with bacteraemia have similar pharmacokinetics and therefore similar joint target attainment of 
CAZ and AVI as patients without  bacteraemia. 
CAZ monotherapy is currently approved for the treatment of bacteraemia associated, or expected to be 
associated,  with  cUTI,  cIAI  and  nosocomial  pneumonia  (HAP/VAP)  (EMEA/H/A-30/1006).  No  CAZ  dose 
adjustments are needed for patients with  bacteraemia in comparison to non-bacteraemic patients.   
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and the joint target attainment for CAZ and AVI appear similar in patients with and  
without  bacteraemia. Similar posology in these patient  populations is endorsed.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
The  5  main  studies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE,  REPROVE)  were  conducted  to 
support  the  currently  approved  indications  for  Zavicefta.  These  five  Phase  3  studies  were  used  for  a 
pooled analysis to support an extension of the adult cIAI, cUTI, and HAP/VAP indications to patients with 
bacteraemia  associated  with,  or  is  suspected  to  be  associated  with,  any  of  these  infections.  The  MAH 
presented  post-hoc  analyses  of  results  across  these  studies  from  the  sub-group  of  patients  in  the 
Gram-negative  extended  ME  at  TOC  population  who   had  bacteraemia  at  baseline  (54  patients  in  the  
CAZ-AVI  +/-MTZ  treatment  group  and  47  patients  in  the  pooled  comparator  treatment  group).  In  the 
analysis  performed  for  this  submission,  bacteraemia  was  defined  as  any  patient  who  had  1  or  more 
bacteria  identified  from  a  blood  culture  at  baseline  for  all  studies,  except  for  1  of  the  cUTI  studies 
(RECAPTURE),  which  also  required  the  same  pathogen  to  be  identified  in  a  urine  sample  at  >105 
colony-forming units  (CFUs)/ml.      
The  CHMP  considered  that  5  adult  Phase  3  main  studies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE, 
REPROVE)  have  been  presented,  and  assessed  before,  in  connection  with  previous  applications  for  
Zavicefta (i.e., EMEA/H/C/004027/0000 – initial  MAA and EMEA/H/C/004027II/0002 - Type II variation 
application to provide the results  from the finalized REPROVE study). Therefore, the methods and results  
for  these  studies  are  only  briefly  described  in  this  assessment  report.  The  main  focus  will  be  on  the  
post-hoc analysis of efficacy data from the sub-group of patients who had bacteraemia at baseline across 
these 5 studies.  
A brief overview of the overall study designs for each of the 5 adult Phase 3 studies is presented below, 
and  in  Table  1  above.  The  primary  endpoint  results  and  analysis  populations  presented  are  those 
corresponding to the ROW (rest of world, including  EU) analyses in each original Clinical Study Report 
(CSR).  Of  note,  randomisation  was  not  stratified  by  bacteraemia  status  at  baseline  in  any  of  these 
studies. 
RECLAIM  and  RECLAIM3  were  both  prospective,  randomised,  multi-centre,  double-blind, 
double-dummy,  comparative  studies  to  determine  the  efficacy, safety and  tolerability  of CAZ-AVI  plus

metronidazole (MTZ) versus meropenem in the treatment of hospitalised adults with cIAI. RECLAIM was 
conducted  in  predominantly  Western  patients  whereas  RECLAIM3  was  conducted  at  sites  in  the 
Asia-Pacific  region.  Patients  were  stratified  by  baseline  severity  of  disease  and  region.  The  primary 
objective was to assess the non-inferiority of CAZ-AVI plus MTZ compared to meropenem with respect to  
clinical cure at the TOC visit for the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis population  (RECLAIM) and  
the clinically evaluable (CE) analysis population (both  RECLAIM and RECLAIM 3): 
Figure 5. RECLAIM (cIAI- Global) and RECLAIM3 (cIAI- Asia)

RECAPTURE  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multi-centre,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  comparative 
study  to  determine  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  CAZ-AVI  compared  with  doripenem  in  the  
treatment of hospitalised patients with cUTIs. Patients  were stratified by type of infection at baseline and  
region.  The  primary  objective  for  the  ROW  analysis  was  to  assess  the  non-inferiority  of  CAZ-AVI 
compared to doripenem with respect to the per-patient microbiological response at the TOC visit in the  
mMITT analysis population:

REPROVE  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multi-centre,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  comparative 
study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  CAZ-AVI versus  meropenem  in  the 
treatment  of  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP)  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  (VAP),  in 
hospitalised adult patients. Patients were stratified by type of infection (VAP/non-VAP) and geographical 
region. The primary objective was to assess the non-inferiority of CAZ-AVI compared to meropenem with 
respect  to  clinical  cure  at  the  TOC  visit  for  the  clinically  modified  intent-to-treat  (cMITT)  and  clinically 
evaluable (CE) analysis populations:

LFU Late follow Up. NI Non-Inferiority 
REPRISE was a prospective, randomised, multi-centre, open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate 
the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  CAZ-AVI  and  Best  Available  Therapy  (BAT)  in  the  treatment  of 
hospitalised  adults  with  cIAIs  and  cUTIs  caused  by  CAZ-resistant  Gram-negative  pathogens.  Patients 
were  stratified  by entry  diagnosis  and  region.  The substantial  majority  (306/333  patients)  had  cUTI at 
baseline and therefore REPRISE principally provided supportive evidence of efficacy against CAZ-resistant 
pathogens in the cUTI  indication. The primary objective was to estimate  the per-patient overall clinical 
response to CAZ-AVI and BAT at TOC in  the mMITT analysis population:

The primary endpoint results for each of the  5 adults Phase 3 studies are presented in the table below.  
Table  5.  Primary  Endpoint  Results  for  the  5  Adult  Phase  3  Studies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,

The  table  below  presents  the  results  observed  for  the  primary efficacy  endpoint  in  each  study  for  the 
subset  of  patients  with  bacteraemia  at  baseline,  that  were  analysed  as  a  pre-specified  descriptive 
sub-group analysis in 4 of the 5 adult Phase 3 s tudies (RECLAIM, RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE and REPROVE). 
These  results  were  presented  in  the  individual  CSRs,  and  assessed  in  connection  with  previously 
submitted  applications for Zavicefta (initial  MAA and EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0002).

Zavicefta  was  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  complicated 
intra-abdominal  and  urinary  tract  infections,  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  (including  VAP)  as  well  as 
infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms where treatment options are limited, primarily based 
on the outcome of the main studies as show in Table 2 and Table 3 above. 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  patients  with  bacteremia  were  included  from  five  Phase  3  studies 
(RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE,  REPROVE)  and the  MAH  submitted  a  pooled  analysis  of 
results across studies.

Comparison  and  analyses  of  results  across  studies  -  pooled  analysis  of 
efficacy  
Results for the subset of patients with bacteraemia at baseline who were enrolled in the 5 Phase 3 studies 
are  summarised  in  the  sections  below.  Patients  with  bacteraemia  at  baseline  are  referred  to  as  the 
Bacteraemia  subset(s)  and  all  patients  enrolled  in  any  of  the  5  Phase  3  studies  are  referred  to  as  the 
“Overall set”. 
Summaries were presented according to the following indications: 
• 
• 
cIAI: includes patients enrolled from RECLAIM, RECLAIM3 and REPRISE/cIAI; 
cUTI: includes patients enrolled from RECAPTURE and REPRISE/cUTI; 
•  NP: includes patients enrolled from REPROVE. For this study, patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment at baseline who enrolled prior to amendment 3 and who received the original 
dosing were excluded from the pooled efficacy analysis because they were not part of the primary 
efficacy analyses presented in the CSR for the REPROVE study in  the initial MAA. 
•  All  Indications  (cIAI,  cUTI  and  NP):  includes  patients   enrolled  from  any  of  the  above  studies  
(RECLAIM, RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE, REPRISE and REPROVE). 
Methods 
Study participants – population included in the pooled analysis 
A total of 101 patients in the Bacteremia subset (i.e., 54 patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group  
and 47 patients in the pooled comparator treatment group) were included in the Gram-negative extended 
ME  at  TOC  population.  Within  each  indication  in  total  21  patients,  57  patients  and  23  patients  were 
included in the following diagnosis categories cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP, respectively.

Treatments 
A brief description of the treatments in the different treatment groups in the main studies are presented 
in Table 1 and under section “Main  studies” above. 
The comparators used in the main studies (which also included patients with bacteraemia) were already 
considered appropriate  by  the CHMP  in  the  context  of  the  assessment  of  the  initial  MAA  for  use  in  the 
treatment  of  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP  (including  VAP)  as  well  as  infections  due  to  aerobic  Gram-negative 
organisms 
where 
treatment 
options 
are 
limited 
(EMEA/H/C/004027/0000 
and  
EMEA/H/C/004027II/0002).  Furthermore,  meropenem,  the  main  comparator  in  the  studies  concerning 
cIAI and HAP/VAP, is approved in EU for treatment of bacteraemia in association with these indications. 
For doripenem, the main comparator in the cUTI studies, no restriction with respect to the use in pa tients  
with  bacteraemia is included in  its EU SmPC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy  endpoints  were  assessed  in  relation  to  the  primary  diagnosis,  according  to  the  definitions  of  
response utilised in each of the individual studies (see above under section “Main study”,  table 3). The  
efficacy results for each set (i.e. the Bacteraemia subset and the Overall set) were presented for CAZ-AVI 
± MTZ and comparator for the following endpoints: 
•  Clinical  response  at  TOC  and  at  EOT  (favourable  clinical  response  at  TOC  was  considered  the 
efficacy endpoint of interest of this pooled analysis of efficacy) 
• 
• 
• 
Per-pathogen microbiological response at TOC 
Per-patient microbiological response at TOC and at  EOT 
Emergent infections 
Statistical methods 
No  formal  statistical  hypotheses  testing  was  performed.  Efficacy  data  in  the  Bacteraemia  Subset,  and 
Overall Set, presented for CAZ-AVI±MTZ and comparator, were summarised descriptively for the three 
indications (cIAI, cUTI, NP) separately and combined.  
Descriptive statistics for age, sex and race for the Bacteraemia subset and Overall set were presented.  
Analysis population 
The Gram-negative extended ME at TOC population (see definition of populations below) is considered the 
main analysis population, since, for the Bacteraemia subset, this population is limited to patients with the  
most  relevant  pathogens  (i.e.,  aerobic  Gram-negative  bacteria -  either  Enterobacteriaceae  or  aerobic 
Gram-negative  pathogens  other  than Enterobacteriaceae)  isolated  from  the  blood  at  baseline.  For  the 
purposes of this application, data presentations are focused on the Gram-negative extended ME at TOC 
population.  
Definitions for each of the analysis populations used for the pooled efficacy analyses are as follows: 
Extended  ME  at  TOC  population. The ME and extended ME at TOC analysis sets was not included as 
formal analysis sets in this submission, but are defined here to aid the definition of  the Gram-negative 
extended ME  population below. 
• 
The ME analysis set across the pivotal Phase 3 studies included patients  who were compliant with 
Assessment report

the protocol (as defined in each of the individual studies), had an evaluable clinical response (i.e., 
not  indeterminate),  and  had  a  study-qualifying  Gram-negative  pathogen  at  baseline.  The 
REPRISE study did not have an ME  analysis set defined. 
• 
The definition of the extended ME analysis set was the same as the ME analysis set b ut without a  
requirement  for  susceptibility  of  the  baseline  pathogen  to  study  treatment.  For  the  REPRISE 
study,  the  extended  ME  analysis  set  was  a  subset  of  the  mMITT  analysis  set  and  comprised 
patients  who  also  received  a  minimum  duration  of  study  treatment  and  had  no  major  protocol 
deviations that  would affect the assessment of efficacy. 
Gram-Negative  Extend ed  ME  population  at  TOC. For the Overall set, the Gram-negative extended 
ME population was defined as a subset of the extended ME population as defined in each individual study, 
limited  to  patients  with  aerobic  Gram-negative  bacteria  (either  Enterobacteriaceae  or  aerobic 
Gram-negative  pathogens  other  than  Enterobacteriaceae)  isolated  from  the  primary  site  of  infection 
and/or  blood.  For  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  this  population  was  further  limited  to  subjects  with 
Gram-negative pathogens isolated from the blood at baseline. 
mMITT  population.  The  mMITT  population  across  the  Phase  3  studies  was  defined  as  patients  who  
received  1  dose  of  study  drug,  met  the  protocol-specific  disease  definition,  and  who  had  at  least  1 
etiologic pathogen at baseline at the primary site of infection and/or in blood, excluding those that were 
not  expected  to  respond  to  either  s tudy  treatment  (i.e.,  patients  with  only  the  monomicrobial 
Gram-negative  infections  against  which  CAZ-AVI  has  no  activity,  such  as  any  of  the  Acinetobacter 
species,  any  of 
the  Legionella  species,  Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia,  or  Elizabethkingia 
meningoseptica). RECAPTURE 1 & 2 also required the same pathogen to be identified in a urine sample 
at  >105  CFUs/ml.  For  the  REPRISE  study,  the  mMITT  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  met  the  
protocol-specific  disease  definition,  had  a  ceftazidime-resistant  Gram-negative  pathogen  on  the 
study-qualifying culture, and received at least 1  dose of study therapy. 
Results 
Baseline data 
The  MAH  stated  that  compared  with  the  Overall  set,  patients  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were slightly 
older, had a higher proportion of females and Asian patients and higher mean baseline APACHE II scores 
(Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation). The mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) was lower in 
the Bacteraemia subset than the Overall set. 
Demographic and disease characteristics for the Bacteremia subset are presented in the tables below.

Prior systemic antibiotic use 
In  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  for all  indications  combined,  almost  half  of  the  subjects  had  prior  systemic 
antibiotic use (42.6% for the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group and 46.8% for the comparator treatment 
group). Most of the prior systemic antibiotic use was reported for patients in the cIAI studies (63.6% for 
the CAZ-AVI + MTZ treatment group and 80.0% for the comparator treatment group) and the NP study 
(66.7%  for the CAZ-AVI treatment group and 75.0% for the meropenem treatment group).  
In the Overall set 45.4% of the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group and 45.8% of the comparator treatment 
group had prior systemic antibiotic use with patients in the cIAI and NP studies reporting the most prior 
systemic antibiotic  use.   
The CHMP noted that a comparison of demographic and disease characteristics for the Bacteraemia and 
the Overall set had not been provided by the MAH. However, according to the MAH, compared with the  
Overall set, patients in the Bacteraemia subset were slightly older, had a higher proportion of females and

Asian patients and higher mean baseline APACHE II scores. The mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) was 
lower in the Bacteraemia subset than the Overall set. As illustrated in the tables above, although some 
differences within each indications were observed for the Bacteraemia subset, the distribution of pa tients  
according  to  baseline  demographic and  disease  characteristics  were  largely  similar  between  treatment 
groups  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  by  indication  and  across  all  indications.  Considering  the  small 
numbers in the Bacteraemia subset for each diagnosis included in these post-hoc analyses, no meaningful 
conclusions based on these differences can be drawn. These considerations were acceptable to the CHMP. 
Baseline microbiology 
The  most  commonly  isolated  pathogens  in  CAZ-AVI  treated  patients  with  bacteremia  (Bacteraemia 
subset), were E. coli (68.5%), followed by P. aeruginosa (20.4%), K. pneumonia (18.5% ), and E. cloacae 
(7.4%)  (Table 9).

REPRISE, REPROVE) 
A patient can have more than 1 pathogen. Multiple isolates of the same species from the same patient are counted only 
once.  
Percentages  are based  on the total number  of patients in the treatment group (N). 
For  All  Enterobacteriaceae  isolated  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  treatment  group  (n=38,  the  Bacteraemia 
subset), the CAZ-AVI MIC range was 0.015  to 2 μg/mL with  an MIC90 of 0.25  μg/mL. 
For P. aeruginosa isolated in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group (n=10, the Bacteraemia subset), the 
CAZ-AVI MIC range was 1 to >256  μg/mL with  an MIC90 of 8 μg/mL. 
The  MAH  stated  that  CAZ-AVI  MICs  were  generally  low  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  and  in  general,  the 
distribution  of   baseline  MICs  of  Gram-negative  pathogens  were  balanced  across  treatment  arms  and 
across all indications.

For  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  CAZ-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  pathogens  were  identified  in  18.5% 
(n=10) of patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and in 38.3% (n=18) of patients in the comparator group. 
The  number  of  CAZ-resistant  P.  aeruginosa  was  very  limited  in  both  treatment  arms.  A  summary  of 
CAZ-resistant isolates by pathogen are presented for the Gram-negative extended ME at TOC population 
is presented in Table 10.

Comparison of efficacy results of all  studies 
For this submission, clinical cure (as related to the primary diagnosis) at the TOC visit was presented for 
each  indication  and  for  all  indications  combined  as  the  main  efficacy  analysis.  Clinical  cure  at  TOC 
corresponds to the primary efficacy parameter, which was assessed in the primary analysis populations 
for the majority of the Phase 3 studies. For the RECAPTURE study, the primary efficacy endpoint was per- 
patient microbiological response at TOC in the Gram-negative extended ME at TOC population. Therefore, 
this endpoint  is additionally presented below for the cUTI indication in  the Bacteraemia subset.

each Indication, for the Bacteremia Subset and the Over all Set (Studies RECLAIM, RECLAIM3, 
RECAPTURE, REPRISE, REPROVE) 
The CHMP considered that, for all indications combined, the clinical cure rate at TOC was 87.0% (47/54) 
for  patients  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  treatment  group  vs.  83.0%  (39/47)  in  the  comparator  treatment 
group. The difference in clinical cure rates at TOC of CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group minus comparator 
treatment group was 4.1% (95%  CI: -10.21,  +19.09).   
Despite the limited number of patients in each specific diagnosis category (cIAI, cUTI, HAP/VAP) included 
in the post-hoc analyses; generally, the presented results indicate a favourable clinical response at TOC 
for CAZ-AVI patients with bacteraemia at baseline. Overall, these results were comparable to those seen 
in the comparator group as well as in the  overall population for each of the  3 indications  
In  total,  there  were  no  substantial  differences  in  the  mMITT  analysis  set  (not  shown)  compared  to  the 
Gram-negative extended ME  at TOC analysis set.

The CHMP considered that, for the most commonly isolated pathogens in the Bacteraemia subsets for all 
indications combined, the clinical cure rates by baseline pathogen for CAZ-AVI ± MTZ were supportive of  
the overall clinical efficacy response. For the Bacteraemia subset, clinical cure rates by baseline pathogen 
in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group were: 100% for E. cloacae (4/4); 81.0% for E. coli (17/21), 100%  
for K. pneumoniae (7/7); and 72.7% for P. aeruginosa (8/11). The corresponding results in the Overall 
set were generally comparable with  the results seen in the Bacteraemia subset.

for the cUTI indication 
The CHMP considered that the observed rates of favourable per-patient microbiological response at EOT 
and TOC for the Bacteraemia subset were similar across treatment groups. For patients in the CAZ-AVI ± 
MTZ  treatment  group,  the  rates  between  the   Bacteraemia  subset  and  the  Overall  set  were  largely 
comparable.  
Regarding  per-patient  microbiological  response  at  TOC  (primary  endpoint  for  the  cUTI  Indication), 
favourable response  rate  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  for  the  cUTI  indication  was  much  higher  (92.9%, 
26/28)  in  the  CAZ-AVI  treatment  group  compared  to  for  the  comparator  treatment  group  (69.0%, 
20/29).  This trend was generally consistent with  the results seen in the Overall set.

Per-pathogen microbiological response at TOC

All  Indications  –  Gram  negative  Extend ed  ME  at  TOC  Population  (Studies  RECLAIM, 
RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE, REPRISE, REPROVE) 
The CHMP considered that comparisons of the per-pathogen microbiological favourable response rates in 
the  Bacteraemia  subset  are  limited  by  small  numbers  for  any  given  pathogen  (apart  from  E.coli). 
Notwithstanding  this,  overall,  the  results  indicated  similar  favourable response  rates  across  treatment 
groups, and the response trends for any given pathogen between treatment groups in the Bacteraemia 
set were largely comparable to the results in the Overall set. The favourable per-pathogen microbiological 
results were consistent with  the corresponding clinical responses by baseline pathogen.   
Persistence / presumed persistence / persistence with  increasing MICs 
The majority of cases with persistence, presumed persistence or persistence with increasing MIC in the  
Bacteraemia subset were reported from the HAP study. Persistence or presumed persistence at the site of 
infection and/or blood was observed in 22.2% (12/54) of patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group  
and 29.8% (14/47) of patients  in the comparator treatment group of the Bacteraemia subset, regardless 
of indication.  
The proportions of patients with persistent bacteraemia were generally low in both treatment groups; all 
reported cases were presumed persistent based on the clinical response, as no follow-up culture results 
were available at TOC for any of these cases. A total of 4 (7.4%) patients treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ had 
bacteraemia  that  was  presumed  persistent  at  the  TOC  visit  (3  E.  coli,  and  1  Salmonella).  In  the 
corresponding comparator groups, 2 patients (4.3%) had bacteraemia that was presumed persistent at 
the TOC visit (1 K. pneumoniae and 1 P. mirabilis). 
There were no cases of persistent bacteraemia associated with  increasing MIC in the  CAZ-AVI group.  
Per-pathogen  microbiological response by MIC  category 
Per-pathogen  microbiological  response  by  MIC  category  for  each  indication  and  for  the  3  indications 
combined,  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were  compared  to  the  Overall  set.  Due  to  the  small  numbers of 
bacteraemia patients in each group, it was, according to the MAH, no t possible to identify any trends with 
respect to  response by MIC.  
Assessment report

Microbiological response at the TOC visit for patients  infected with CAZ-resistant pathogens 
Favourable  per-patient  microbiological  response  rates  for  bacteraemic  patients  infected  with 
CAZ-resistant pathogens were lower than those observed in the Overall set for both treatment groups at 
TOC.  Similar  trends  were  observed  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  versus  the  Overall  subset  for  each 
indication (cIAI, cUTI, and HAP).  However, the small patient numbers (<5 in each treatment group for  
almost all pathogens) limit interpretation.   
Assessment of per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rates for bacteraemic patients infected 
with  CAZ-resistant pathogens was similarly limited by small numbers for any given pathogen.  
Emergent infections

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The fact that during the Article 30 procedure of ceftazidime in 2011 (EMEA/H/A-30/001006), treatment of  
patients  with  bacteraemia  in  association  with,  or  suspected  to  be  associated  with,  the  approved  adult 
indications  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infection  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary  tract  infection  (cUTI) 
and  hospital-acquired  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  (HAP/VAP)  was  added  to 
the EU SmPC of ceftazidime (brand leader Fortum) is of critical importance for the evaluation of this  Type 
II Variation, is. The additional data submitted for the Fixed Dose Combination Zavicefta, discussed below, 
are merely supplementary. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The proposed indication extension for the addition of bacteraemia associated with the currently approved 
adult indications of cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP is mainly based on post-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety 
data from the sub-group of patients who had bacteraemia at baseline across the previously assessed 5 
Phase  3  studies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE,  REPROVE).  These  studies  were 
conducted  to  support  the  currently  approved  indications  of  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP/VAP.    No  new 
documentation to support this  indication extension has been submitted.   
Main  studies:  The  5  adult  Phase  3  main  s tudies  (RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE, 
REPROVE)  have  been  presented,  and  assessed  before,  in  connection  with  previous  applications  for 
Zavicefta (i.e., EMEA/H/C/004027/0000 – initial  MAA and EMEA/H/C/004027II/0002 - Type II variation 
application to provide the results  from the finalized REPROVE study). Therefore, the methods and results  
for these studies have only been briefly described in this assessment report. The focus has been on the 
post-hoc analysis of efficacy data from the sub-group of patients who had bacteraemia at baseline across 
these  5  studies.  Of  note,  randomization  was  not  stratified  by  bacteraemia  status  at  baseline  in  any  of 
these studies.

VAP) as well as infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms where treatment options are limited, 
primarily based on the  outcome of the above mentioned studies. 
Study participants included in  the pooled analysis, i.e. patients with bac teraemia at baseline: A total of 
101  patients   in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  (54  patients  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  treatment  group  and   47 
patients in the pooled comparator treatment group) were included in the Gram-negative extended ME at 
TOC population. Within each indication in total 21 patients, 57 patients and 23 patients were included in 
the following diagnoses categories cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP, respectively.   
Comparators: The comparators used in the main s tudies (which also included patients  with bacteraemia) 
have already been considered appropriate by the CHMP in connection with  the assessment of the initial 
MAA for use in the treatment of cIAI, cUTI and HAP (including VAP) as well as infections due to aerobic 
Gram-negative  organisms  where  treatment  options  are  limited  (EMEA/H/C/004027/0000  and  
EMEA/H/C/004027II/0002).  Further,  meropenem,  the  main  comparator  in  the  studies concerning  cIAI 
and HAP/VAP, is approved in EU for treatment of bacteraemia in association with  these indications. For  
doripenem, the main comparator in the cUTI studies, no restriction with respect to the use in patients with 
bacteraemia is included in its EU SmPC. 
Demographic  and  disease  characteristics  for  the  Bacteraemia  and  Overall  set:  A  comparison  of 
demographic and disease characteristics for the Bacteraemia and the Overall set was not provided by the 
MAH.  However,  the  MAH  explained  that  patients  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were  slightly  older,  had  a 
higher proportion of females and Asian patients and higher mean baseline APACHE II scores compared 
with the Overall set. The mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) was lower in the Bacteraemia subset than in 
the  Overall  set.  Although  some  differences  within  each  indications  were observed  for  the  Bacteraemia 
subset, the distribution of patients according to baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
largely  similar  between  treatment  groups  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  by  indication  and  across  all 
indications. Considering the small numbers in the Bacteraemia subset for each diagnosis included in these 
post-hoc analyses, no meaningful conclusions based on these differences can be drawn. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Comparison and analyses of results across studies - pooled analysis of efficacy  
Clinical response at TOC and EOT: For all indications combined, the clinical cure rate at TOC was 87.0% 
(47/54)  for  patients  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  treatment  group  vs.  83.0%  (39/47)  in  the  comparator 
treatment group. Despite the limited number of patients in each specific diagnosis category (cIAI, cUTI, 
HAP/VAP),  generally  the  presented  results  indicate  a  favourable  clinical  response  at  TOC  for  CAZ-AVI 
patients  with  bacteraemia  at  baseline.  Overall,  these  results  were  comparable  to  those  seen  in  the 
comparator  group  as  well  as  in  the  overall  population  for  each  of  the  3  indications.  Although  some 
differences  between  Clinical  response  at  EOT  and  TOC  were  seen,  the  presented  results  were  largely 
comparable.  However,  the  small  numbers  included  in  these  analyses  limit  the  interpretation  of  the  
observed  differences.  In  total,  there  were  no  substantial  differences  in  the  mMITT  analysis  set  (not 
shown) compared to the Gram-negative extended ME at TOC analysis set.  
Per-pathogen  clinical  response at  TOC: For  the  most commonly  isolated  pathogens  in  the  Bacteraemia 
subsets for all indications combined, the clinical cure rates by baseline pathogen for CAZ-AVI ± MTZ were 
supportive  of  the  overall  clinical  efficacy  response.  For  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  clinical  cure  rates  by 
baseline pathogen in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group were: 100%  for E. cloacae (4/4); 81.0% for E.

coli  (17/21),  100%  for  K.  pneumoniae  (7/7);  and  72.7%  for  P.  aeruginosa  (8/11).  The  corresponding 
results in the Overall set were generally comparable with  the results seen in the  Bacteraemia subset.  
Per-patient  microbiological  response  at  TOC  and at  EOT:  The observed  rates  of  favourable  per-patient 
microbiological  response  at  EOT  and  TOC  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were  similar  across  treatment 
groups. For patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group, the rates between the Bacteraemia subset 
and  the  Overall  set  were  largely  comparable.  Regarding  per-patient  microbiological  response  at  TOC 
(primary endpoint  for  the  cUTI  indication),  favourable  response  rate  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset for  the 
cUTI indication was much higher (92.9%, 26/28)  in  the CAZ-AVI treatment group compared to for the  
comparator treatment group (69.0%, 20/29). This trend was generally consistent with the results seen in 
the  Overall  set.  The  comparisons  of  the  per-pathogen  microbiological  favourable  response  rates  in  the 
Bacteraemia  subset  are  indeed  limited  by  small  numbers  for  any  given  pathogen  (apart  from E.coli). 
Notwithstanding  this,  overall  the  results  indicated  similar  favourable  response  rates  across  treatment 
groups, and the response trends for any given pathogen between treatment groups in the Bacteraemia 
set were largely comparable to the results in the Overall set. The favorable per-pathogen microbiological 
results  were  consistent  with  the  corresponding  clinical  responses  by  baseline  pathogen. No  trend  for  
outcome by MIC could be discerned. 
Discussion  
Firstly,  during  the  Article  30  procedure  of  ceftazidime  in  2011  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006),  treatment  of 
patients  with  bacteraemia  in  association  with,  or  suspected  to  be  associated  with,  the  approved  adult 
indications  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infection  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary  tract  infection  (cUTI) 
and  hospital-acquired  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  (HAP/VAP)  was  added  to 
the EU  SmPC of ceftazidime (brand leader Fortum).  
Additionally,  it  has  previously  been  demonstrated  that  ceftazidime  and  the  beta-lactamase  inhibitor 
avibactam  penetrate  into  human  epithelial  lining  fluid   (ELF)  to  the  same  extent. Overall,  it  has  been 
concluded  that  the  tissue  penetration  of  avibactam  was  satisfactory  and  not  poorer  compared  to 
ceftazidime  alone,  thereby  ensuring  that  ceftazidime  would  be  protected  from  being  hydrolyzed  by 
beta-lactamases at various infection sites. 
Furthermore,  according  to  the  Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products 
indicated 
for 
treatment 
of 
bacterial 
infections 
(EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) 
regarding 
non-pathogen-specific bacteraemia “it may be possible to accumulate sufficient clinical data to support an 
indication for use of an antibacterial agent in the treatment of bacteraemia that is associated with specific  
types of infection, with or without restriction to certain pathogens. For example, in the case of agents that 
have been in use for many years and are indicated for use in a broad range of infections the total evidence 
may  be  considered  sufficient  for  an  indication  that  reads Treatment  of  patients  with  bacteraemia  that 
occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with, any of the infections listed above (i.e. 
referring  to  the  list  of  indications  approved).  If  the  antibacterial  agent  has  been  evaluated  in  several 
indications  and  the  total  number  of  bacteraemic  patients  treated  across  these  indications  is  deemed 
sufficient (e.g. ~50 or more) to support a conclusion that efficacy is comparable to that in other patients 
or, at least, comparable to that of other treatments, then the addition of the sentence could be considered 
appropriate.” The submitted data have shown  that  the efficacy of Zavicefta in the Bacteraemia subset, 
comprising 54 patients in the CAS-AVI treatment group, was comparable to the Overall set, and overall 
the terms as described in  the Addendum are fulfilled by Zavicefta. 
The additional data provided by the MAH justifies the efficacy of the standard dosing and the adequacy of 
the treatment duration  for the HAP/VAP indication.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
A  type  II  c.I.6a variation  application,  procedure  number  EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0015,  aiming  include  a  
new  indication  for  the  use  of  ceftazidime/avibactam  in  the  treatment  of  cIAI  and  cUTI  in  paediatric 
patients aged ≥3 months to  <18 years, is ongoing at the time of adoption of this assessment report. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Ceftazidime,  the  antibacterial  component  of  this  Fixed  Dose  Combination  is  already  approved  for 
bacteraemia in association with, or suspected to be associated with,  the currently approved indications 
for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP through an Article 30 procedure in 2011 (EMEA/H/A-30/001006). This was of  
critical importance to conclude positively on this Type II Variation concerning the applied extension of the 
indication  to  include  bacteremia  for  Zavicefta.  The  data  based  on  the  Fixed  Dose  Combination  are 
considered  to  be  supplementary  and  most  importantly,  in  that  respect,  are  the  similar  PK  and  tissue  
distribution  of ceftazidime and avibactam. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In seven Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, 2024 adult patients were treated with Zavicefta. The most 
common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Zavicefta were Coombs direct test 
positive, nausea, and diarrhoea. Nausea and diarrhoea were usually mild or moderate in intensity. 
In the currently approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Zavicefta, there are warnings 
and  precautions  regarding  hypersensitivity  reactions,  Clostridium  difficile-associated  diarrhoea,  renal 
impairment, concurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products, 
and  direct  antiglobulin  test  (DAGT  or  Coombs  test)  seroconversion  and  potential  risk  of  haemolytic 
anaemia. 
An overview is given on the important identified and potential risks in adults in the initial RMP submission, 
which were approved as part of the initial  MAA for Zavicefta in 2016,  see Table 18. 
Assessment report

Table 18 Listing of Important Identified and Potential  Risks in the Initial  RMP Submission 
The current Zavicefta European (EU) SmPC is based upon the safety conclusions, submitted in January 
2017  as  part  of  variation  EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0002,  which  is  referred  to  as  the  2016  Summary  of 
Clinical Safety (SCS) within this document. The 2016 SCS includes the analysis of the overall Phase 2/3 
pooled  safety  analysis  population  in  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary 
tract  infections  (cUTI)  and  Hospital-acquired  pneumonia  (HAP)  (5  Phase  3  studies  listed  above  plus  2 
Phase 2 studies: NXL104/2001  and NXL104/2002,  1 each in cUTI and cIAI respectively).  
The  MAH  is  now  applying  for  an  extension  of  the  indication  by  a  Type  II  variation  for  Zavicefta  or 
ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) to add the indication for the treatment of patients with bacteraemia in 
association  with,  or  suspected  to  be  associated  with,  the  currently  approved  adult  indications  for  cIAI, 
cUTI and HAP, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP).  
A  subset  of  data  from  patients  with  bacteraemia  at  baseline  was  created  from  the  overall  Phase  2/3 
pooled safety analysis population in cIAI, cUTI and HAP. However, the patients from the Phase 2 studies 
were not included because it was not possible to programmatically confirm bacteraemia at baseline due 
to different methods of data collection. In addition, the dose of CAZ-AVI used in Study NXL104/2001 was  
lower than the dose used in the  Phase 3 studies.  
A subset of pooled safety data in patients with bacteraemia at baseline were therefore derived from the 
five previously performed and assessed Phase 3 adult studies: 
•  RECLAIM – global, cIAI 
•  RECLAIM3 – Asia, cIAI 
•  RECAPTURE – global, cUTI 
•  REPRISE – global, ceftazidime-resistant pathogens in cIAI &  cUTI 
•  REPROVE – global, HAP/VAP 
Bacteraemia was defined as having 1 or more bacteria identified from a blood culture at baseline for all 
studies, except for RECAPTURE 1 & 2, which also required the same pathogen to be identified in a urine 
sample. The bacteraemia subset was then assessed against the known safety profile of CAZ-AVI. There 
were no formal statistical hypotheses for these analyses; all data were summarised descriptively. 
The  CHMP  noted  tha t  the  clinical  development  program  for  ceftazidime/avibactam  for  this  application 
included patients with bacteraemia in all 5 of  the completed Phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted to  
support  the  approved  indications  of  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP/VAP,  referred  to  as  ‘Bacteraemia  subset’.  A 
post-hoc  analysis  of efficacy and  safety  data  from  this  sub-group  of  patients  who  had  bacteraemia at 
baseline across these 5 studies was performed.

The Bacteraemia safety subset was assessed against the known safety profile of CAZ-AVI presented in 
the  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety  (SCS),  submitted 
in  January  2017  as  part  of  variation 
EMEA/H/C/004027/II/02),  referred  to  as  the  2016  SCS.  The  overall  Phase  2/3  pooled  safety  analysis 
population, presented within  2016 SCS, is referred to as the ‘Overall safety population’. 
Patient exposure 
- Exposure to Ceftazidime-Avibactam  (CAZ-AVI) 
The  evaluation  of  safety  includes  2  pooled  safety  datasets  according  to  the  International  Council  for 
Harmonisation (ICH) M4E  guideline (ICH M4E  Guideline 2002): 
•  Overall safety population: 4050 patients in 7 completed Phase 2 (N=338) and Phase 3 (N=3712) 
CAZ-AVI clinical studies (2016  SCS). 
•  Bacteraemia subset: 183 patients with bacteraemia at baseline in 5 completed Phase 3 CAZ-AVI 
clinical studies. 
The  rationale  for  selecting  the  Phase  2/3  pool  as  the  primary  dataset  for  the  2016  SCS  was  that  the  
patient  populations  in  the  included  studies  were  considered  representative  of  the  target  patient 
populations (ie, patients with serious Gram-negative infections). The Phase 2/3 pool includes all pa tients  
who received at least part of 1 dose of CAZ-AVI and may include patients that have not been included in 
the safety analysis set for the individual studies.  
Additionally, a different Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version was used for the AE 
analyses  of  the  Phase  2/3  pool  than  was  used  in  the  analyses  for  the  individual  CSRs.  Thus,  it  is  not 
possible to compare individual numbers of AEs noted in CSRs with the numbers reported for the Phase 2/3 
pool. For the pooled AE summaries, AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 19.0. 
For  details  of  the  safety variables  collected  and  methods of  evaluation  refer  to  2016  SCS.  Safety  data 
were  summarised  to  the  end  of  treatment  (EOT)  visit  and  were  also  summarised  to  the  end  of  the 
reporting  period  (up  to  and   including  the  Final  Follow-up  visit)  in  each  s tudy  (up  to  the  “last  visit”). 
Discussions will  focus on the last visit (ie, ‘any time up to the  last visit’) summaries.  
The CHMP noted that the pooled analysis focused on the Bacteraemia safety subset, which comprised 183 
patients, of whom 99 received CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and 84 received comparator treatment (carbapenems). 
The safety from these patients are compared to the known safety profile of CAZ-AVI based on over 4000 
patients in 7 completed Phase 2 (N=338) and Phase 3 (N=3712) CAZ-AVI clinical studies (2016 SCS), of 
which half of them - 2024  patients - were treated with  Zavicefta.  
Overall  extent  of exposure 
There was a similar duration of exposure to CAZ-AVI ± MTZ in the Bacteraemia subset, with a mean of 7.7 
days of exposure (Table 19)  compared to 8.2 days in the  Overall safety population (not shown  here).

The CHMP considered that the duration of exposure to CAZ-AVI ± MTZ in the Bacteraemia subset varied 
from  mean  of  7.0  days  in  the  cUTI  indication,  7.6  days  in  cIAI  to  9.3  days  in  pneumonia  (NP/HAP) 
indications,  bearing  in  mind  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  bacteraemia.  There  was,  however,  a 
similar  duration  of  exposure  to  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  with  a  mean  of  7.7  days  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset 
compared to 8.2 days in the Overall safety population.   
Demographics of Study Population 
The demographic and baseline characteristics, for the Bacteraemia subset in the safety analysis set are 
given.  Numerical  differences  in  the  patient  populations  which  may  impact  the  safety  analysis  and 
conclusions are presented below. Demographic and baseline characteristics are further described in the 
Clinical Efficacy section. 
In the Bacteraemia subset, 62% of the patients treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ were female, compared with 
44% in  the Overall safety population treated with  CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. 
A  larger  proportion  of  the  Bacteraemia  subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  were  65  years  and  older 
compared with  the Overall safety population treated with  CAZ-AVI ± MTZ: 
•  Bacteraemia subset: 21.2% were 65  - 74 years; 26.3%  were ≥75 - ≤90  years. 
•  Overall safety population:  17.1% were 65 - 74 years; 15.5%  were ≥75 - ≤90  years. 
•  Bacteraemia subset: mean age was 60.7  years; median 64.0  years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 41/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Overall safety population:  mean age was 53.5  years; median 55.0  years. 
Patients were categorised by level of renal function based on their baseline local laboratory CrCl result 
(calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula) as follows: CrCl ≥81 m L/min = normal renal function, CrCl 51 
to 80 mL/min = mild renal impairment, CrCl 31 to 50 mL/min = moderate renal impairment and CrCl ≤30 
mL/min =  severe renal impairment 
There was a higher proportion of patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the Bacteraemia 
subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  compared  with  the  Overall  safety  population  treated  with 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ: 
•  Bacteraemia subset: 14.1% moderate; 3.0%  severe 
•  Overall safety population:  8.6% moderate; 1.1%  severe 
•  Mean CrCl in the Bacteraemia subset: 78.2  ml/ min; median 77.0 ml/min 
•  Mean CrCl in the Overall safety population: 95  ml/min; median 87.5 ml/min  
Disease  Characteristics 
The  system  "Acute Physiology,  Age,  Chronic  Health  Evaluation  II"  (APACHE  II)  is a  severity-of-disease 
classification  system.  The  APACHE  II  scores  at  baseline  were  only  captured  in  the  study  database  for 
patients in the cIAI and NP studies – the APACHE II scores for the Bacteraemia subset are presented in 
Table  20.  The  median  APACHE  II  scores  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  (12  for  both  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ 
treatment group and the comparator treatment group) were higher than for the Overall safety population 
(9 for both the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group and the comparator treatment group).  
Table  20.  Disease  Characteristics  (APACHE  II  score)  at  Baseline  for  Patients  with 
Bacteraemia  –   (Saf ety  Population)  (Studies  RECLAIM,  RECLAIM3,  RECAPTURE,  REPRISE, 
REPROVE) 
In  the  CAZ-AVI-treatment  group,  38  patients  were  from  EU  member  states.  The  largest  proportion  of 
these patients (18)  was recruited in the Czech Republic. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  there  was  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal 
insufficiency  in  the Bacteraemia subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  compared  with  the  Overall safety 
population (14.1% moderate; 3.0% severe the Bacteraemia subset compared to 8.6% moderate; 1.1% 
severe  Overall).  This  means  that  17  of  the  99  patients  with  bacteraemia  dosed  with  Zavicefta  had  a 
moderate/severe renal insufficiency, which then according to the posology recommendation in the SmPC 
should  have  received  a  reduced  dose  of  Zavicefta.  However,  if  the  dose  reductions  are  performed  as 
recommended according to renal status, it is not expected that patients with bacteraemia are at greater 
risk for adverse events than for patients without  bacteraemia.

The  MAH  suggested that  the  differences  between  patients  included  in  Bacteremia  subset  and  Overall 
safety population when evaluating demographic characteristics may be due to small number of patients 
included in CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group in Bacteremia subset (n=99). 
The  CHMP  took  into  account  that  more  patients  in  the  CAZ-AVI  group  were  female,  older,  with  more 
severe renal impairment than in Overall patient pool. The median APACHE II scores for the Bacteraemia 
subset was also higher than for the Overall safety population, which is not unexpected due to the severity 
of bacteraemia. In conclusion, the differences observed are compatible with the clinical appearance of the 
patient with  blood stream infection. 
Adverse events 
AEs with an onset date and time on or after the date and time of  the first dose of study drug up to and  
including the  last visit are summarised below.  
Analysis of Adverse Events  
The  incidence  of  AEs  up  to  last  visit  in  the Bacteraemia  subset  and  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  Overall 
safety population  are presented below in Table 21. 
A higher rate of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) was reported in both treatment arms in the total 
Bacteraemia  subset  compared  with  the  Overall  safety  population  and  this  was  also  true  for  the 
bacteraemic  patients  with  cUTI  taking  CAZ-AVI  compared  with  the overall  cUTI  safety  population.  This 
may be explained by the difference in the underlying medical condition of the patients in the Bacteraemia 
subset and may be magnified by the smaller denominators of the Bacteraemia subset as compared to the 
Overall safety population. This higher rate was not seen with regards to the AEs of severe intensity or AEs 
with  the outcome of death in  patients taking CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. 
There  was  a  similar rate  of  severe  events  in  the Bacteraemia  subset  compared  with  the  Overall safety 
population.  With  regards  to  cUTI,  a  higher  rate  of  severe  events  was  seen  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset 
compared  to  the  Overall  safety  population  which  could  reflect  that  patients  with  bacteraemia  may  be 
more unwell at baseline, however this must be interpreted with caution as the number of patients (2) is 
very small and it  may be caused by the lower denominator. 
In the Bacteraemia subset, as the denominators were small in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and the comparator 
arms, and the comparator arm comprises of several different drugs, direct comparison between the two 
is not appropriate. However, if a difference was seen in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ arm, the comparator arm was 
also assessed as to whether the same trend was observed.

serious  adverse events  (SAEs;  12.1%  vs.8.7%)  was  reported  in  CAZ-AVI  treatment  arms  in  the  total 
Bacteraemia subset compared with the Overall safety population. A similar difference was seen for the  
comparator  arm.  However,  the  number  of  AEs,  any  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  IP  were 
consistently  higher  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  group,  only  any  AEs  of  severe  intensity  was  higher  (6  vs  7 
(6.1%  vs  7.1%))  in  the  comparator  group.  Thus  overall,  in  the  bacteremia  subset,  the  safety  was 
numerically less favourable compared with the comparator. Although this may, as claimed by the MAH, be 
explained by the difference in the underlying condition of the patients in the Bacteraemia subset and may 
also be magnified by the smaller denominators, for the CAZ-AVI arm, these differences seem to be driven 
by the bacteraemic patients with cUTI (bo th any AEs and SAEs) and NP. The higher rates of AEs in the  
bacteremia  patients  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  may  also  partly  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  patients  in  the  
Bacteremia  subset  were  older  and  had  more  severe renal  impairment,  compared  to  the  Overall safety 
population in patients  taking CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. 
The  Committee  also  noted  the  very  high  frequency  of  SAEs  (6 patients,  25%)  and  AEs  with  severe 
intensity (4 patients, 16.7%) in the comparator arm for the pooled cIAI studies, when the corresponding 
observed  frequencies  for  CAZ-AVI  were  the  same  for  the  total  Bacteraemia subset  compared  with  the 
Overall safety population. However, due to the small number of patients and events, this result should be  
interpreted  with  caution.  This  observation  is,  however,  of  no  importance  for  the  Zavicefta  risk 
assessment. 
Common Adverse Events 
The most common adverse events up to the last visit for the Bacteraemia subset are presented below in 
Table 22. 
• 
• 
The preferred terms (PTs) in the Bacteraemia subset were varied; most PTs only occurred in one 
patient in  either the  CAZ-AVI ± MTZ or the comparator group, and no patterns were identified. 
The  most  frequently  occurring  PTs  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ-treated 
group were Diarrhoea and Nausea; these were the same as the most frequently occurring PTs in 
the  Overall  safety  population  and  are  known common ADRs  with  CAZ  AVI  (Zavicefta  EU SmPC 
2019).

The  CHMP  considered  that  in  total  69  of  the  99  patients  with  bacteriaemia  treated  with  CAZ-AVI 
experienced any AE. There are a number of observed AEs reported in the Bacteraemia subset which are 
not included in the approved Zavicefta SmPC: constipation (observed in 7 patients, 7.1%), hypertension, 
pyrexia and UTI (5 patients each, 5.1%), insomnia, nephrolithiasis (4 pts each, 4.0%), atrial fibrillation, 
cough,  hypoalbuminaemia  (3  pts  each,  3.0%),  back  pain,  flank  pain,  hypokalaemia,  nasopharyngitis, 
pain in extremity, pneumonia and wound  infection (2 pts each, 2.0%). In addition, anaemia, asthenia, 
and  pheripheral  oedema  were  reported  in  1  CAZ-AVI  treated  patient  each  (1.0%).  Most  of  these  are 
common AEs/symptoms with a high background incidence and study drug relatedness can be difficult to 
assess (see below for assessment of relationship to study drug).

Incidence of Adverse Events – Maximum  Reported Intensity 
Up  to  last  visit,  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  most  patients  who  had  an AE,  reported  it  with  a  maximum 
intensity of mild (Table 23).

There was no individual severe PT reported by >1 patient in the Bacteraemia subset. Six (6) patients who  
received  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  experienced  at  least  1  severe  AE.  These  were  Migraine,  Cardiac  Arrest, 
Cardio-respiratory arrest, Cardiac failure congestive, Left ventricular failure, Peripheral artery occlusion, 
Acute kidney injury and Procedural haemorrhage. 
There were no patterns of severe AEs. The AEs with severe intensity tended to be those expected to occur 
in patients  with severe infections and, therefore, reflect the underlying infection or associated surgery. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  AEs  with  severe  intensity  were  observed  in  6  patients  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  in 
bacteraemia  subset.  No  specific  patterns  of  severe  AEs could  be  seen.  The  Committee  agreed  that  the 
observed AEs with  severe intensity may reflect the underlying infection  or associated surgery. 
Incidence of Adverse Events – Relationship to Study  Drug 
The most common (reported by ≥2 patients in either of the treatment groups) treatment-related adverse 
events up to last visit for the Bacteraemia subset were Diarrhoea, Headache and Nausea (Table 24) which 
are known ADRs included in the Zavicefta Investigator’s Brochure (IB) Table 7-3 and Zavicefta EU SmPC 
2019  Section 4.8.  Most AEs in the Bacteraemia subset were assessed as not related to the study drug.

The CHMP noted that most AEs in the Bacteraemia subset were assessed as not related to the study drug. 
Of  the  69  patients  with  bacteriaemia  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  that  experienced  any  AE,  there  were  18 
patients who experienced treatment-related AEs; 2 in cIAI, 8 in cUTI and 8 in NP. No trends regarding AEs 
related to treatment is apparent and no specific trends are expected, having in mind the low number of 
patients  in  this  subset;  99  CAZ-AVI  treated  patients  with  bacteraemia  compared  to  a  total  of  2024 
patients in  the five studies.  
The  most  common  treatment-related  adverse  events  up  to  last  visit  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were 
Diarrhoea (5 pts), Headache and Nausea (1 patient  each).  
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System  or Syndrome 
Safety  topic  of  interest  (STOI)  for  CAZ-AVI  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  is  presented  here  and  the 
corresponding summary of STOI for CAZ-AVI in the Overall safety population is presented in 2016 SCS. 
The  AE  PTs  and  potentially  clinically  significant  (PCS)  laboratory  results  up  to  the  last  visit  that  are 
relevant to each STOI were assessed for the Bacteraemia subset. The incidence of 5 STOI (liver disorders, 
diarrhoea,  hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis,  haematological  disorders  and  renal  disorders)  were 
programmatically assessed based on pre-defined AE PTs (MedDRA Version 19).   
Hepatotoxicity and risk of neurological sequelae when the dose is not appropriately reduced in patients 
with  renal  impairment  are  important  potential  risks  in  the  currently  approved  Zavicefta  EU  Risk 
Management Plan v2.0.  
According to the MAH, no new safety findings were identified on review of these events and the majority 
of  the  AEs  in  the  STOI  were  known  ADRs.  See  below  for  a  discussion  of  the  frequency  of  the  AE  of 
diarrhoea.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  safety  topic  of  interest  (STOI)  for CAZ-AVI  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  was 
presented in detail in the documentation submitted by the MAH (detailed presentation of the issues and 
with regard to separate indications and  in total for the overall population, is given in 2016 SCS, as stated  
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 49/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
above).  However, 
there  are 
few  events 
in 
these  areas: 
liver  disorders,  diarrhoea, 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, haematological disorders, and renal disorders.  
Renal disorders were identified as an STOI based on the ceftazidime SmPC in which interstitial nephritis 
and  acute  renal  failure  are  recognized ADRs  (Fortum  SmPC  2016).  In  the  current SmPC  for  Renal  and 
urinary disorders the following ADRs are listed (frequency uncommon): Blood creatinine increased, Blood 
urea increased and Acute kidney injury. In addition, Tubulointerstitial nephritis is reported as very rare. 
In the subset in question, relevant AEs Urinary tract infection is reported in 5 pts, nephrolithiasis in 4 p ts, 
flank pain in 2 p ts and acute kidney injury in 2 pts and  cystitis in 1 patient treated with CAZ-AVI. As none 
of these AEs are deemed related to treatment (at least not for 2 or more patients, see comment under 
“Incidence of Adverse Events – Relationship to Study Drug”), this issue was not discussed any further by 
the MAH,  which was acceptable to the  CHMP. The issue of diarrhoea is discussed below. 
Adverse Drug Reactions for the  Bacteraemia  Subset 
The frequency of each ADR for the Bacteraemia subset was compared to the frequencies of ADRs for CAZ 
AVI  in  the  Overall  safety  population.  Important  caveats  with  regard  to  this  assessment  are  that  the 
bacteraemia pooled data subset has a small denominator which is too small  to accurately estimate the  
true frequency and so any ADR occurring in 1 patient has a frequency of 1/99 (>1.0% = common).  The 
patients who comprise the Bacteraemia subset were included in the original frequency determination for 
Zavicefta EU SmPC Section 4.8. 
ADR frequencies in the Bacteraemia subset were generally in line with  the ADR frequencies reported in 
the Overall safety population and the known safety profile of ceftazidime and no change to the Zavicefta 
EU SmPC is required. 
ADRs observed at a higher frequency in the Bacteraemia subset than in the Overall safety population are 
presented in Table 25 below.  
Diarrhoea  is  common  in  the  Zavicefta  EU  SmPC  but  was  very  common  (12.12%)  in  the  Bacteraemia 
subset (Table 25). A detailed safety analysis of each individual case was conducted. All the patients in the  
Bacteraemia  subset  had  non-serious,  mild  or  moderate  events  of  Diarrhoea.  Of  the  12  patients  in  the 
Bacteraemia  subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  who  had  diarrhoea,  9  were  from  the  REPROVE  study 
with an indication of NP. The frequency of this population was 15.4% in the Overall safety population. The 
patients  with  the  remaining  indications  had  a  frequency  of  diarrhoea  in  line  with  the  Overall  safety 
population.  There  were  7  patients  with  diarrhoea  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  CAZ-AVI  by  the 
investigator and these cases did not have a clear temporal relationship to CAZ-AVI treatment, had prior 
laxative  treatment  or  resolved even  though  CAZ-AVI  was continued.  A  slight  increase  in  frequency  of 
diarrhoea (>10%) was seen in the Overall safety population in patients  >75 years old, however it was  
assessed that this was not a significant difference and might have been due to the smaller denominator. 
As mentioned in section 4.6. Safety in special populations, Bacteraemia subset has a slightly higher age 
than the  Overall safety population. For these reasons, no new safety finding was identified. 
This  difference  in  frequency  of  diarrhoea  is  not  clinically  significant  and  may  have  been  related  to  the 
small  denominator  and  the  increased  age  of  the  patients   in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  which  made  the  
frequency more aligned with  that seen in the Overall safety population in  patients >75 years old.  
Neutropenia,  Lymphocytosis,  Blood  creatinine  increased,  and Acute  kidney  injury  were  expected  to  be 
seen in less than 1 in 100 patients (frequency categories of uncommon, rare and frequency unknown as 
presented in the current Zavicefta EU SmPC), however the denominator of 99 in the Bacteraemia subset 
automatically  makes  any reported ADR  >1%  (i.e. common).  There  was  no  evidence  of a  difference  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 50/66 
 
 
 
 
safety profile (e.g. severity) on assessment of these ADRs. This difference in frequency is not clinically 
significant and is related to the small denominator. 
Table 25. ADRs Occurring at a Higher Frequ ency in th e Bacteraemia Subset than  in the Overall  
Safety  Population 
Source: Zavicefta EU SmPC. 
As mentioned above, the Committee noted that the presentation of the STOI (elsewhere denoted Adverse 
Events  of  Special  Interest,  AEoSI)  for  CAZ-AVI  was  minimal.  These  STOI  are,  however,  previously 
predefined to be liver disorders, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, haematological disorders, and 
renal disorders. 
It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  tha t  caveats  with  regard  to  this  assessment  are  that  the  bacteraemia 
pooled data subset has a small denominator which is too small to accurately estimate the true frequency 
and so any ADR occurring in 1 patient  has a frequency of 1/99 (>1.0%  = common). It is  therefore not 
expected to observe much differences or new safety issues in this application.  
Some  ADRs  (Neutropenia,  Lymphocytosis,  Blood  creatinine  increased,  and  Acute  kidney  injury)  were 
observed in higher frequencies than expected from previously reported uncommon frequency (less than 
1  in  100  patients).  However,  in  this  bacteraemia  pooled  population  these  ADRs  were  observed  in 
frequency common, all represented with only one patient (out of  99), except Acute kidney injury which 
were experienced by two patients. Diarrhoea was also reported with a higher frequency than previously 
reported, but within  the same frequency category (common). The increase in the reported frequency is 
explainable by age, indication and small denominator, and is deemed not clinically significant, which is  
agreed by the Committee. 
With  regard  to  the RMP,  at  the  time  of  adoption  of  this  Assessment  Report,  a  revision  of  the  currently 
approved  RMP  v2.0  was  under  evaluation  in  the  application  for  paediatric  indications  (cIAI  and  cUTI, 
procedure  number  EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0015)  and  hence,  amendments  are  requested  within  that 
variation  application.  Additionally, 
the  RMP  was  updated  as  approved 
in 
the  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0008  (Opinion  April  2018)  to  remove  the  important  identified  risks  Anaphylaxis 
and  other  severe  Hypersensitivity  and  Clostridium  difficile  associated  diarrhoea  (CDAD)  from  PART  II. 
Module SVII.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
All AEs with a fatal outcome in the Bacteraemia subset were considered unrelated by the Investigator and 
no new safety findings with  regards to CAZ-AVI were observed with regard to  the patients who died: 
•  Six (6) deaths (3 CAZ-AVI ± MTZ; 3 comparator) occurred up to the last visit in patients in the  
Bacteraemia subset. 
• 
Three (3) patients had death due to disease progression which was not recorded as an AE as the 
individual studies contained a protocolled exemption of capturing these as AEs because they were 
part of the study objectives. 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 51/66 
 
 
 
 
• 
Three (3) patients had an AE with a fatal outcome (Cardiac arrest and Cardio-respiratory arrest in 
the CAZ-AVI group and Septic shock in the comparator group) all of which were considered by the 
Investigator to  be unrelated to study treatment. 
•  All  patients  who  died,  who  had  an  available  score  at  baseline,  had  an  Acute  Physiology  and 
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score >10. One (1) patient with cUTI, who did no t have an 
APACHE II score recorded, was over 80 years old and had cardiomyopathy as a secondary cause 
of death. 
The Committee noted that there were 3 deaths reported in patients treated with CAZ-AVI and 3 deaths 
reported in patients in the comparator treatment arm who were all received meropenem. In the CAZ-AVI 
group  one  of  these  were  due  to  disease  progression  (PD),  the  other  two  cardiac  arrest  and 
cardio-respiratory.  All  AEs  with  a  fatal  outcome  were  considered  unrelated  to  study  treatment  by  the 
Investigator.  
Serious adverse  events 
A  higher  rate  of  SAEs  was  reported  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  compared  with  the  Overall  safety 
population in both treatment groups (Table 21). This may be explained by the difference in the baseline 
condition of the patients in the Bacteraemia subset, who may be expected to have associated symptoms 
such as tachycardia, fever or sepsis and may be magnified by the smaller denominator. SAEs up to last 
visit  by  decreasing  order  (of  the  total)  of   incidence  for  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  and  by  PT,  for  patients  with 
Bacteremia are presented in Table 27.

The  Committee  noted  that  there  were  12  patients  with  bacteraemia  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  who 
experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE),  it  was  not  stated  how  many  were  considered 
treatment-related. 
A  higher  rate  of  SAEs  was  reported  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  compared  with  the  Overall  safety 
population in both  treatment groups; CAZ-AVI vs. comparator: 12.1% vs. 9.5% compared to 8.7% vs. 
7.2% in the Overall safety population. The MAH stated that this higher frequency can be explained by the 
underlying  mores severe  disease at  baseline.  This  explanation  is  reasonable and  was  accepted  by  the 
Committee. There were no new safety findings on review of SAEs.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
No trends were identified on assessment of potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory evaluations 
as defined in the 2016 SCS. PCS post-baseline haematology and clinical chemistry values, anytime up to 
last  visit,  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  are  presented  in  tables  (not  shown  here).  Overall,  the  CAZ-AVI 
laboratory  results  for  the  Bacteraemia  subset  were  in  line  with  the  results  seen  in  the  Overall  safety 
population. 
Vital  signs, physical examination,  electrocardiogram, and left ventricular ejection fraction  
Electrocardiogram  (ECG),  vital  sign  or  Physical  Examination  data  were  not  pooled  for  the  Phase  2  and 
Phase 3 studies. 
Safety in special populations 
The intrinsic and extrinsic factors for the Overall safety population are presented in the in the 2016 SCS, 
and assessed within that  procedure.  
Effect of Age 
A  larger  proportion  of  the  Bacteraemia  subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  were  over  65  years  old 
compared with the Overall safety population treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. The AEs up to last visit in any 
category by age group, for the  Bacteraemia subset are presented below in Table 28. 
In the Bacteraemia subset treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ, there was a higher incidence of AEs in each age 
cohort compared to the Overall safety population, in line with what was observed in total. The incidence 
of AEs also rose with age. In each age cohort, very few patients had AEs with a fatal outcome, SAEs and 
severe AEs however the incidence tended to rise with increasing age cohort. This was also observed for 
the  comparator  group  and  reflects  what  was  seen  in  the  Overall  safety  population  where  the  older 
population has a higher rate of AEs compared with  patients <65  years old.  
With  the  caveat  that  the  cohorts  were  very  small  to  make  any firm  conclusions,  no  clinically relevant 
effect of age on the safety profile in the Bacteraemia subset was identified.

Effect of Gender 
Most patients (62%) treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ were female in the Bacteremia subset, compared to the 
Overall safety population treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. Nonetheless, there was no clinically meaningful 
difference  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  between  genders.  Although  there  was  a 
higher incidence of AEs overall in the Bacteraemia subset compared to the Overall safety population this 
was also observed for the comparator group and there was no clinically meaningful difference between 
the Bacteraemia subset and the  Overall safety population based on gender. 
Effect of Race 
AEs  were  assessed  by  race  and  there  were  no  new  safety  findings.  Similar  to  the  Overall  safety 
population, most patients in the Bacteraemia subset were White or Asian. Numbers of patients in all other 
race categories were too small for meaningful comparisons (<10 patients per treatment group). 
The incidence of AEs in the Bacteraemia subset up to the last visit was similar between White and Asian 
patients and treatment groups. Although there was a higher incidence of AEs overall in the Bacteraemia 
subset compared to the Overall safety population this was also observed for the comparator group and 
there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  the  Bacteraemia  subset  and  the  Overall  safety 
population based on race.  
Effect of Body Mass Index 
AEs were assessed by baseline BMI and there were no new safety findings. The incidence of AEs in the 
Bacteraemia subset up to the last visit was similar across BMI category and treatment groups. There was 
no  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  the  Bacteraemia  subset  and  the  Overall  safety  population 
based on baseline BMI. 
Effect of Renal Function 
As  mentioned  before,  the  patients  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  had  worse  renal  function  in  the  
Bacteremia subset, compared to the Overall safety population treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ (mild renal 
impairment according to mean and median CrCl in  the Bacteremia subset and normal renal function in 
Overall safety  population).    Most  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ-treated  and  comparator  patients  in  the  Bacteraemia 
subset  had  normal  renal  function  or  mild  renal  impairment  (CrCl  ≥51  mL/min)  (82.8%  and  76.2%, 
respectively). Numbers of patients in the severe renal impairment subgroup were too small (<5 patients) 
for  meaningful  comparison.  The  number  of  patients  within  each  CrCl  s tratum  was  balanced  across 
treatment groups. 
The AEs up to last visit in any category by baseline renal status for the Bacteraemia subset are presented 
below in Table 29. In the Bacteraemia subset of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment there 
were  no  new  safety  findings.  The  incidence  of  AEs  in  these  patients  was  similar  between  treatment 
groups. Although there was a higher incidence of AEs overall in the Bacteraemia subset compared to the 
Overall  safety  population,  this  was also  observed  for  the  comparator  group and  there  was  no  clinically 
meaningful  difference  between  the  Bacteraemia  subset  and  the  Overall  safety  population  based  on 
baseline renal status.

Adverse Events by Geographic Region 
The number of patients in the Bacteraemia subset that were enrolled by region across treatment groups 
were balanced and most of the patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and comparator groups were from Eastern 
Europe (36.4% and 36.9%,  respectively) and Rest of World (44.4% and 42.9%,  respectively). 
The incidence of AEs in each AE category for CAZ-AVI ± MTZ patients was similar to comparator for each 
geographic region. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the Bacteraemia subset and the 
Overall safety population based on region. 
The  Committee  noted  that  a  larger  proportion  of  the  Bacteraemia subset  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ 
were over 65 years old compared with the Overall safety population treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. In the 
Bacteraemia subset treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ, there was a higher incidence of AEs  in each age cohort 
compared to the Overall safety population. The incidence of AEs also rose with age. In each age cohort, 
very few patients had AEs with a fatal outcome, SAEs and severe AEs, however, the incidence tended to 
rise with increasing age cohort. This was also observed for the comparator group and reflects what was 
seen in the Overall safety population where the older population has a higher rate of AEs compared with 
patients <65  years old.  
With  the  caveat  that  the cohorts  were  very  small  to  make  any firm  conclusions,  no  clinically relevant 
effect  of  age  on  the  safety  profile  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  was  identified.  In  addition,  there  was 
apparently  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  the  Bacteraemia  subset and  the  Overall  safety 
population  based  on  gender,  race,  baseline BMI,  baseline  renal  status  or  region  which  were  the  other 
special populations analysed.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
This  section  describes  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset.  According  to  the  MAH, 
CAZ-AVI  was  well  tolerated  in  this  subset  of  patients  and  most events  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
non-serious: 
•  Six (6) patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group of the Bacteraemia subset had at least 1 AE leading  
to discontinuation  of study treatment. 
•  No individual PT was reported in more than 1 patient in the Bacteraemia subset. Two (2) pa tients  
in  the  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  group  discontinued  due  to  known  ADRs  (Vomiting,  Drug  eruption) 
(Zavicefta EU SmPC).  
•  Three (3) AEs in 3 patients tha t led to  discontinuation were SAEs (1 patient in the CAZ-AVI group 
[Cardio-respiratory arrest] and 2 in the comparator group [Drug eruption, Septic shock])   
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product (IP) up to EOT by system organ class

The Committee noted that, overall, 2.6% and 1.7% of patients in the CAZ-AVI +/− MTZ and comparator 
treatment groups, respectively, discontinued study drug due to AEs in the Overall safety population (2016 
SCS).  In  the  Bacteraemia  subset  these  numbers  were  higher;  6.1%  vs.  3.6%.  The  6  patients  with 
bacteraemia who discontinued CAZ-AVI due to AEs were all reported as different PTs. Hence, there were 
no clustering in events leading to discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
As  of  26  April  2019,  46  events  in  30  post  marketing  cases  were  identified  that  reported an  indication 
which included at least one PT from the following  MedDRA v21.1 Higher Level Terms (HLTs): HLT  Sepsis, 
bacteraemia,  viraemia  and  fungaemia  NEC,  HLT  Endocarditis,  HLT  Vascular  Infections.  These  were 
considered to reflect either bacteraemia, sepsis or an intravascular bacterial infection.  
The  31  indications  in  30  cases  identified  to  be  associated  with  bacteraemia  were:  Sepsis  (12), 
Bacteraemia  (11),  Septic  shock  (3).  Abdominal  sepsis  (2),  Endocarditis,  Escherichia  bacteraemia  and 
Neutropenic sepsis (1  each).  
Most  cases did not contain sufficient information to fully assess the underlying source of infection: 
• 
Five  (5)  cases  were  assessed  to  be  cIAI:  Abdominal  sepsis  (2),  Abdominal  infection  (2), 
Peritonitis bacterial (1).   
• 
Five  (5)  cases  were  assessed  to  be  infections  in  patients  with  Gram-negative  infections  with 
limited  treatment  options:  Bacteraemia  in  a  patient  with  refractory  B-cell  lymphoma,  CNS 
ventriculitis, Endocarditis, Neutropenic sepsis, Osteomyelitis (1  each). 
•  Nineteen (19) cases did not provide a source or site of infection:  Bacteraemia (8), Sepsis (8), 
Septic shock (3), Bacterial infection, Enterobacter infection,  Pseudomonas infection (1  each).   
•  One  case  reported  pneumonia  but  did  not  confirm  if  the  patient  had  HAP.  With  regards  to  the 
events reported in the post-marketing cases: 
•  On assessment, 9 cases do not describe adverse events, but describe the following : Off label use  
in  bacteraemia  [PTs  Off  label  use,  Product  use  in  unapproved  indication],  Off  label  use  in 
Paediatrics [PTs Off label use, Product use issue (5 events)] and prolonged duration of therapy 
[PT Product use issue (2 events)].  
•  Seven  (7)  cases  describe  progression  of  the  underlying  disease  or  lack  of  efficacy:  PTs  Drug 
ineffective (3),  Death (2),  Infection and Condition  aggravated (1 each). 
•  Six (6) cases only describe known ADRs without evidence of an increase in severity or frequency: 
PTs  Acute  kidney  injury  (3),  Seizure,  Toxic  encephalopathy,  Epilepsy,  Encephalopathy, 
Hypersensitivity  (1  each).   One  (1)  of  these  6 cases  also  reports  an  overdose  in  a  patient  with 
renal impairment (PT Product use issue). 
•  Three  (3)  cases  did  not  contain  sufficient  information  to  perform  a  causal  assessment:  PTs

issue). 
No new safety issues have been identified in the population of patients  with bacteraemia at baseline or 
indications indicative of bloodstream infections from post marketing surveillance. 
An RMP has not been provided within this application as with regards to this Type II variation there are no 
changes with respect to the list of safety concerns, no change to the current routine pharmacovigilance 
activities and routine risk minimisation activities, and no change to the risk-benefit balance of Zavicefta.  
The CHMP noted that a search as of 26 April 2019 of AEs in post-marketing cases reporting an indication 
which  was  considered  to  reflect  either  bacteraemia,  sepsis  or  an  intravascular  bacterial  infection, 
identified  46  events  in  30  post  marketing  cases.  According  to  the  MAH,  no  new  safety  issues  with 
Zavicefta treatment were identified from post-marketing surveillance in the population of patients with 
bacteraemia / bloodstream infections at baseline. 
The  patients  with  bacteraemia  from  the  clinical  development  programme  are  already  included  in  the  
current EU-RMP in SIII Clinical trial exposure as this is a subset analysis of the overall safety data set. The 
MAH  did  not  find  any  reason  for  updating  the  RMP  for  this  Type  II  variation,  which  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  RMP  will  anyhow  be  upda ted  as  part  of  procedure  EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0015    (application  for  
extension of indication to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years for Zavicefta for 
the treatment of cIAI and cUTI), which was ongoing at the time  of adoption of this assessment report.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
With  this  Type  II  variation  procedure,  the  MAH  is  applying  for  an  extension  of  the  indication  for 
ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI), to add the treatment of pa tients with bacteraemia in association with, 
or  suspected  to  be  associated  with  the  currently  approved  adult  indications  for  complicated 
intra-abdominal  infection  (cIAI),  complicated  urinary  tract  infection  (cUTI)  and  hospital-acquired 
pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). 
The clinical development programme for ceftazidime/avibactam included patients with bacteraemia in all 
5 of the completed Phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted to support the approved indications of cIAI, 
cUTI  and  HAP/VAP.  Data  was  derived  from  the  following  clinical  studies:  RECLAIM  (global,  cIAI), 
RECLAIM3 (Asia, cIAI), RECAPTURE (global, cUTI), REPRISE (global, ceftazidime-resistant pathogens in 
cIAI & cUTI) and REPROVE (global, HAP/VAP). A post-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety data from the 
sub-group  of  patients  who  had  bacteraemia  at  baseline  across  these  5  studies  was  performed.  The 
Bacteraemia safety subset was then assessed against the known safety profile of CAZ-AVI presented and 
submitted in January 2017 as part of variation EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0002). The known safety profile is 
based  on  the  overall  Phase  2/3  pooled  safety  analysis  population  (comprising  these  five studies  plus  2 
phase 2 studies), and is referred to as the ‘Overall safety population’. These comprise 4050 patients, of 
which 2024  treated with  CAZ-AVI.  
The  Bacteraemia  safety  subset  comprised  183  patients,  of  whom  99  received CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  and  84 
received  comparator  treatment.  The  differences  between  patients  included  in  Bacteremia  subset  and 
Overall safety population when evaluating demographic characteristics may be due to small number of 
patients  included  in  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  group  in  Bacteremia  subset  (n=99).  The  duration  of  exposure  to 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ in the Bacteraemia subset varied from mean of 7.0 days in the cUTI indication, 7.6 days 
in  cIAI  to  9.3  days  in  pneumonia  (NP/HAP)  indications.  There  was,  however,  a  similar  duration  of  
exposure to CAZ-AVI ± MTZ with a mean of 7.7 days in the Bacteraemia subset compared to 8.2 days in 
the Overall safety population.   
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 59/66 
 
 
 
There was a higher proportion of patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the Bacteraemia 
subset treated with  CAZ-AVI ± MTZ compared with  the Overall safety population.   
Adverse events: 
There were many AEs reported in the bacteraemia safety subset treated with CAZ AVI ± MTZ, both known 
from the safety profile of Zavicefta, and AEs not known with its use. Most AEs in the Bacteraemia subset 
were assessed as not related to the study drug. In total 69 of the 99 patients with bacteriaemia treated 
with  CAZ-AVI  experienced  any  AE,  and  of  these  69,  there  were  18  patients  (18%)  who  experienced 
treatment-related AEs. The most common AEs in this population were diarrhoea and nausea (12 and 9 
patients, respectively), which are known ADRs of CAZ-AVI. The most common treatment-related adverse 
events up to last visit for the Bacteraemia subset were diarrhoea (5 pts), headache and nausea (1 patient 
each). There were 12 patients with bacteraemia treated with CAZ-AVI who experienced a serious adverse 
event (SAE), it is not stated how many were considered treatment-related. A higher rate of AEs (69.7% 
vs. 49.2%) and serious adverse events (SAEs; 12.1% vs.8.7%) was reported in the CAZ-AVI treatment 
arm in the total Bacteraemia subset compared with the Overall safety population. A similar difference was 
seen in the comparator arm. These higher frequencies seem in general to be driven by the cUTI and the 
NP population. The MAH claimed tha t these increases in frequencies can be explained by the difference in 
the  underlying  condition  of  the  patients  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset,  who  were  older  and  had  a  higher 
APACHE score at baseline, who may be expected to have symptoms associated with bacteraemia such as 
tachycardia, fever or sepsis and may also be magnified by the smaller denominators. This was considered 
reasonable and accepted by the  Committee.  
Deaths and serious adverse events: 
Deaths: 
Six  (6)  deaths  (3  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ;  3  comparator)  occurred  up  to  the  last  visit  in  patients  in  the 
Bacteraemia subset. None of the AEs with a fatal outcome was considered related to study treatment by 
the Investigator. 
Serious adverse events: 
The  SAEs  reported  in  the  Bacteraemia  safety  subset  were  in-line  with  what  would  be expected  for  the 
underlying indications and there were no new safety findings on review of SAEs. 
Discontinuation due to AEs: 
Overall, 6.1% (6 patients) and 3.6%  (4 pa tients) of pa tients in the CAZ-AVI +/−  MTZ and comparator 
treatment groups, respectively, discontinued study drug due to AEs in bacteraemia subset. No individual 
PT was reported in more than 1  patient in the Bacteraemia subset.  
Considering all the above, the assessment of the safety from the subset of patients with bacteraemia in 
the pooled adult safety data did not  identify new safety issues in  patients with  bacteraemia.

report. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of CAZ-AVI ± MTZ was evaluated in a subset of patients with bacteraemia at baseline from the 
Phase  3  pooled  safety  population  from  five  Phase  3  adult  studies  in  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP:  RECLAIM, 
RECLAIM 3, RECAPTURE, REPROVE and REPRISE. The Bacteraemia safety subset comprised 183 patients, 
of whom 99 received CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and 84 received comparator treatment, was assessed against the 
known safety profile of CAZ-AVI.  
There were many AEs reported in the bacteraemia safety subset treated with CAZ AVI ± MTZ. The most 
common  AEs  in  this  population  were  diarrhoea  and  nausea.  Most  AEs  in  the  Bacteraemia subset  were 
assessed  as  not  related  to  the  study  drug.  Six  patients  of  99  patients  with  bacteraemia  discontinued 
CAZ-AVI treatment due to AEs. None of  the AEs with a fatal outcome were considered related to study 
treatment by the Investigator. The SAEs reported in the Bacteraemia safety subset were in line with what 
would  be  expected  for  the  underlying  indications  and  there  were  no  new  safety  findings  on  review  of 
SAEs. 
The higher rates of AEs in the bacteremia patients treated with CAZ-AVI may be due to small number of 
patients  included  in  the  Bacteraemia  subset  compared  to  Overall  safety  population,  and  also  due  to 
underlying medical conditions, patients in the Bacteremia subset being older and had more severe renal 
impairment, compared to the Overall safety population  in patients taking CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. 
The safety profile of the Bacteraemia safety subset is in line with the expected safety profile for CAZ-AVI 
in adults and  the established safety profile of ceftazidime alone, or the pattern of AEs expected for the  
patient population. No new safety issues were identified for CAZ AVI, however, acknowledging the limited 
database of patients with  bacteraemia. 
Approval  to  include  treatment  of  patients  with  bacteraemia  in association  with  the  currently  approved 
adult indications  for cIAI, cUTI and HAP is recommended from a safety point of view. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC  
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect the 
recommendation of approval for including  treatment of bacteraemia.  
- Section 4.1 (Therapeutic indications): 
Zavicefta is indicated for the  treatment of the following infections in adults (see sections 4.4  and 5.1): 
• 
• 
• 
Complicated intra-abdominal infection  (cIAI) 
Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including  pyelonephritis  
Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
Treatment of patients with bacteraemi a that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 61/66 
 
 
 
 
 
Zavicefta is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adult 
patients with  limited treatment  options (see sections 4.2, 4.4  and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.  
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1,  which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
No  justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with  target patient  groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed extension of indication for Zavicefta is to include treatment of bacteraemia (in association 
with, or suspected to be associated with, the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP 
in adults. 
Bacteraemia  due  to  Gram-negative  pathogens  is  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and  mortality. 
Nearly 2 million episodes of bloodstream infection in North America and Europe annually led to ~250,000 
deaths and nearly half of community-acquired and one third of healthcare associated cases were caused 
by Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of the therapy is to cure the infection. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Infections associated with bacteraemia may be severe, require hospitalisation and have the potential to 
be  life-threatening.  Bacteraemia  due  to  resistant  pathogens  is  increasing  in  frequency  and associated 
with  more  adverse  effects.  Prompt  administration  of  effective  antibiotics  is  therefore  critical  for  a 
favorable outcome. There are no specific treatment guidelines for treatment of bac teraemia as such. The 
choice of the treatment is dependent of  the clinical condition (e.g. site of infection, resistance, pathogens  
etc.).  Relevant  treatment  options  for  bacteraemia  caused  by  multi-drug  resistant  Gram-negative 
pathogens (e.g. ESBL producing organisms) are carbapenems. Other options that still may be used in the  
setting of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteraemia (including carbapenem-resistant pathogens), 
alone or in combination with  other agents, include colistin, tigecycline and fosfomycin. 
Infections due to multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly common. Few antibiotics 
with activity against ESBL and carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria are currently available. 
However, alternative treatment options which are efficacious against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative 
bacteria would  be useful.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  MAH  did  not  conduct  any  specific  studies  to  support  the  proposed  indication  extension.  The  main 
evidence  of  efficacy  and  safety  is  based  on  post-hoc  analysis  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the 
sub-group of patients who had bacteraemia at baseline across the previously assessed 5 Phase 3 studies. 
These studies (RECLAIM, RECLAIM3, RECAPTURE, REPRISE, REPROVE) were conducted to support 
the  currently  approved  indications  of  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP/VAP  in  adults.  Meropenem  was  the  main 
comparator in the studies concerning cIAI and HAP/VAP, while doripenem was the main comparator in the 
cUTI studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For  all  indications  combined,  the  clinical  cure  rate at  TOC  in  the  Bacteraemia  efficacy subset  was  87% 
(47/54) for patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group vs. 83% (39/47) in the comparator treatment 
group. Although some differences between Clinical response at EOT and TOC were seen, the presented 
results  were  largely  comparable;  the  clinical  cure  at  EOT  in  the  Bacteraemia  set  was  92.6%  in  the 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group compared to 93.6% in the comparator group. The corresponding results 
in the Overall set were generally comparable with the results seen in  the Bacteraemia set. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For  all  indications  combined,  the  clinical  cure  rate at  TOC  in  the  Bacteraemia  efficacy subset  was  87% 
(47/54) for patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group vs. 83% (39/47) in the comparator treatment 
group. Although some differences between Clinical response at EOT and TOC were seen, the presented 
results  were  largely  comparable;  the  clinical  cure  at  EOT  in  the  Bacteraemia  set  was  92.6%  in  the 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group compared to 93.6% in the comparator group. The corresponding results 
in the Overall set were generally comparable with the results seen in  the Bacteraemia set. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  bacteraemia  safety subset  comprised  183  patients,  of  whom  99  received  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ  and  84 
received comparator treatment. In total, 99 CAZ-AVI treated patients with bacteraemia compared to a 
total of 2024 pts in total in the five studies. The Overall population receiving CAZ-AVI or comparator was 
4050  patients. 
In total 69 of the 99 patients with bacteriaemia treated with CAZ-AVI experienced any AE, and of these 
69, there were 18 patients (18% ) who experienced treatment-related AEs. The most common AEs in this  
population  were  diarrhoea  and  nausea  (12  and  9  patients,  respectively),  which  are  known  ADRs  of 
CAZ-AVI. The most common treatment-related adverse events up to last visit for the bacteraemia subset 
were diarrhoea (5 pts), headache and nausea (1 patient each). There were 12 patients with bacteraemia 
treated with CAZ-AVI who experienced a serious adverse event (SAE), it is  not s tated how many were 
considered treatment-related.  
A  higher  rate  of  AEs  (69.7%  vs.  49.2%)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs;  12.1%  vs.  8.7%)  was 
reported in the CAZ-AVI treatment arm in the total bacteraemia subset compared with the overall safety 
population. 
Six  (6)  deaths  (3  CAZ-AVI  ±  MTZ;  3  comparator)  occurred  up  to  the  last  visit  in  patients  in  the 
bacteraemia subset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/437085/2020  
Page 63/66 
 
 
 
Six  patients  of  99  (6.1%)  patients  with  bacteraemia  discontinued  CAZ-AVI  treatment  due  to  AEs,  all 
different PTs.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The bacteraemia safety subset comprised 183 patients, of whom 99 received CAZ-AVI ± MTZ, and hence, 
the population of patients with bacteriaemia was rather limited. Very few patients had cIAI and NP, the 
majority of the patients  come from the  cUTI studies. 
There was a higher proportion of patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the Bacteraemia 
subset treated with  CAZ-AVI ± MTZ compared with  the Overall safety population. 
The observed increases in AEs and SAEs compared to the Overall population represent an uncertainty.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For ceftazidime, the antibacterial component of this FDC, bacteraemia in association with, or suspected to 
be associated with,  the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP is already approved 
through an Article 30 procedure in 2011  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006). 
Despite the limitations  of data due  to  the small numbers included  in  the Bacteraemia subsets, the fact 
that the randomisation was not s tratified by bacteraemia status at baseline in any of the main studies, 
and that the efficacy analyses were only descriptive; for all indications combined, the clinical cure rate at 
TOC in the Bacteraemia set was broadly in line with the corresponding results in the Overall set, and the 
microbiological outcomes were generally in support of the main clinical responses.   
Furthermore, the efficacy in the HAP/VAP CAZ-AVI bacteremia subset was comparable to the comparator 
(i.e., the cure rates at TOC were 66.7% vs. 62.5% in the CAZ-AVI and meropenem groups, respectively). 
However, the number of patients with bacteraemia included in these HAP/VAP subsets is very limited and 
hence  cure  rates  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Importantly,  a  similar  shift  in  the  cure  rates  in 
HAP/VAP patients from EOT to TOC visit was seen in both the test and comparator groups. Considering 
the high mortality and serious complications associated with  HAP/VAP, this  shift could be expected.  
For ceftazidime, the antibacterial component of this FDC, bacteraemia in association with, or suspected to 
be associated with,  the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP is already approved 
through  an  Article  30  procedure  in  2011  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006).  In  addition,  it  has  previously  been 
demonstrated  that  there  was  no  concerns  about  tissue  penetration  of  the  beta-lactamase  inhibitor 
avibactam  to  the  relevant  infection  sites  such  as  ELF.  The  pharmacokinetics  and  the  joint  target 
attainment for ceftazidime and avibactam appear similar in patients with and without bacteraemia. This 
supports  that  the  approved  doses  for  certain  site  specific  infections  (including  HAP/VAP)  are  also 
appropriate for patients with concurrent bacteraemia. Moreover, the formal grounds in terms of being an 
antibacterial agent used for many years and indicated for use in a broad range of infections as reflected 
in  the  Addendum  to  the  g uideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for  treatment  of  
bacterial infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013),  are fulfilled.

The observed increases in AEs and SAEs can be explained by the difference in the underlying condition of  
the patients in the Bacteraemia subset, who were older and had a higher APACHE score at baseline. None 
of the AEs with a fatal outcome was considered related to study treatment by the Investigator.  
The higher proportion of patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the Bacteraemia subset 
treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ compared with the Overall safety population might have an impact on the 
safety profile. However, due to assumed dose reductions according to the recommendations in the SmPC, 
this unbalance is not considered to induce an additional risk. 
The safety profile of the Bacteraemia safety subset is in line with the expected safety profile for CAZ-AVI 
in adults and  the established safety profile of ceftazidime alone, or the pattern of AEs expected for the  
patient  population.  In  total,  acknowledging  the  limited  database  of  patients  with  bacteraemia,  the 
assessment of safety from the subset of patients with bacteraemia in the pooled adult safety population 
did not identify new safety issues in patients  with bacteraemia. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Zavicefta for the treatment of patients with bacteraemia in association with the already 
approved adult indications for cIAI and cUTI is positive. Taking into account the additional da ta, provided 
by  the  MAH,  the  risk-benefit  balance  for  the  bacteraemia  indication  covering  HAP/VAP  is  also  positive. 
However, the data specific for the FDC Zavicefta are mainly considered to be supplementary.  It has to be 
emphasised  that  the  fact  that  for  ceftazidime,  the  antibacterial  component of  this  FDC,  bacteraemia  in 
association with, or suspected to be associated with, the currently approved indications for cIAI, cUTI and 
HAP/VAP  is already  approved  through  an Article  30  procedure  in  2011  (EMEA/H/A-30/001006)  was  of 
critical importance for reaching a positive conclusion. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zavicefta on the extension of the indications to include bacteraemia in association with 
the already approved adult indications for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP is positive.

Extension of Indication to include bacteraemia (in association with, or suspected to  be associated with, 
the currently approved indications for complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), complicated urinary 
tract  infection  (cUTI)  and  hospital-acquired  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia 
(HAP/VAP)) for Zavicefta; as a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to 
add this indication and the posology. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.1. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB are recommended.

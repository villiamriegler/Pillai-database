Given that cobicistat is a strong CYP3A inhibitor and the 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to add new 
information about the drug-drug interactions 
between cobicistat containing products (Genvoya, 
Tybost and Stribild) and corticosteroids, based on 
post-marketing data. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to bring the Tybost Product Information 
in line with version 10.2 of the QRD template and 
update the list of local representatives. Moreover, 
minor editorial updates and corrections have been 
possibility of systemic absorption of corticosteroids when 
administered cutaneously, development of Cushing’s 
syndrome and secondary adrenal suppression from 
concomitant administration of cobicistat-containing 
products and cutaneously-administered CYP3A-metabolized 
corticosteroids was considered plausible. 
For coadministration of cutaneously-administered 
corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, the treating 
physician should refer to the prescribing information of the 
corticosteroid for conditions or uses that augment its 
systemic absorption.

The results from a prospective study (IMPAACT P1026s) 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 of the SmPC of 
Stribild, Tybost and Genvoya and section 5.2 of the 
SmPC of Genvoya and Stribild based on 
pharmacokinetics data in pregnancy from IMPAACT 
study P1026s (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00042289); 
this is an ongoing, nonrandomized, open-label, 
parallel-group, multi-centre phase 4 prospective 
study of antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and safety in HIV-1 infected pregnant women that 
includes an arm for EVG/COBI.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took 
the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10. 
showed that treatment with cobicistat and elvitegravir-
containing regimens during pregnancy results in lower 
elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures. Cobicistat levels 
decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting.  The 
substantial reduction in elvitegravir and darunavir exposure 
may result in virological failure and an increased risk of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Based on 
this, the product information for Genvoya, Stribild and 
Tybost have been updated to recommend that therapy with 
these therapies should not be initiated during pregnancy, 
and women who become pregnant during therapy should 
be switched to an alternative regimen.

Submission of the final report from Study GS-US-
236-0140 listed as a category 3 study in the Risk 
Management Plan.  
This is a randomized, open-label, phase IV study 
evaluating the renal effect of Elvitegravir/ Cobicistat/ 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF or other Tenofovir DF-
containing Regimens (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir 
plus Emtricitabine /Tenofovir DF or Efavirenz 
/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF) compared to Ritonavir-
boosted Atazanavir plus Abacavir/ Lamivudine in 
Antiretroviral Treatment-naïve HIV-1 Infected Adults 
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥70 
mL/min. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
study GS-US-236-0140 which was conducted to provide 
information on renal function and markers of renal tubular 
function to address the safety 
concern of renal toxicity associated with 
tenofovir/disoproxil fumarate (TDF).The primary objective 
was to evaluate the effect of Stribild and other TDF-
containing regimens on renal function, as assessed by 
markers of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in HIV-infected 
treatment-naïve adults with estimated GFR (eGFR) 
calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (eGFRCG) ≥ 
70 mL/min. The results demonstrated that TDF-containing 
regimens administered as STB, TVD plus ATV/r, or ATR do 
not affect renal function as demonstrated by no effect in 
aGFR for up to 24 weeks in HIV-infected subjects. The 
results from Study GS-US-236-0140 also demonstrated 
that COBI does not affect the actual glomerular filtration 
rate and only affects the estimated glomerular filtration 
rate due to inhibition of MATE1 transporter-mediated 
secretion of creatinine in the proximal tubules. Given these 
effects, the decreases in mean values seen for estimated 
glomerular filtration rates calculated using the Cockcroft-
Gault equation or the modification of diet in renal disease

equation for COBI- and RTV-containing regimens were not 
considered clinically meaningful. In addition, there were no 
clinically relevant changes in markers of renal tubular 
functions (serum and urine creatinine, urine albumin, urine 
protein, urine β2-microglubulin, and urine RBP) for any of 
the treatment groups. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic results were consistent with 
historical data for the respective treatments. 
All 4 study treatments were generally well tolerated and 
the safety profiles were as expected for these well 
characterized regimens, with no new safety findings 
reported. Based on these results no change to the product 
information was warranted.

recommendation stemming from this study is that no dose

orGenvoya is warranted upon co-administration, and that 
Atripla should not be co-administered with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

no dose adjustment is recommended.  The increased 
exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including 
renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely 
monitored.

reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside

hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, that 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology,

The results of the three studies show that subjects already

The efficacy of switching to Stribild was non-inferior to the

exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of 
antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 
2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post-
exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently 
updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 
BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient 
with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent

combination tablet Stribild 
(elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) and with 
Vitekta 85mg (elvitegravir) and atazanavir boosted by

The study results did not indicate clinically significant 
interactions between telaprevir and Stribild nor between 
telaprevir and elvitegravir (with atazanavir/ritonavir). 
Section 4.5 of the SmPCs (and corresponding sections of 
the PLs) were updated to state that no dose adjustments 
are required when Stribild or Tybost are administered with 
telaprevir, nor when Vitekta is administered with ritonavir-

The most frequently reported adverse events reported in 
the study were in line with the safety profiles of the drugs

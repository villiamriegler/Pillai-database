Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra 
IV (Infliximab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV. 
The RMP details important risks of Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV, how these risks can be 
minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra 
IV's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Remsima  IV/SC  and  Inflectra  IV's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPCs)  and  its 
package leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients 
on how Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV should be used.   
This summary of the RMP for Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV should be read in the context 
of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is a part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).   
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Remsima 
IV/SC and Inflectra IV’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Remsima/Inflectra IV is authorised in adults with the following diseases: 
•  Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  (an  immune-system  disease  causing  inflammation  of  the 
joints). Remsima/Inflectra IV is used with methotrexate (a medicine that acts on the 
immune system); 
•  Crohn’s disease (CD) (a disease-causing inflammation of the digestive tract), when the 
disease is moderate to severe or fistulising (with the formation of fistulae, abnormal 
passageways between the gut and other organs); 
•  Ulcerative colitis (UC) (a disease-causing inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the 
gut); 
•  Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (a disease-causing inflammation and pain in the joints of 
the spine); 
•  Psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  (a  disease  causing  red,  scaly  patches  on  the  skin  and 
inflammation of the joints); 
•  Psoriasis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin). 
Remsima/Inflectra IV is also used in patients aged between 6 and 17 years with severe, active 
CD or severely active UC, when they have not responded to or cannot take other medicines or 
treatments (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains infliximab as the active substance and 
it is given by intravenous route. 
Remsima SC is authorised in adults with the following diseases: 
•  Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  (an  immune-system  disease  causing  inflammation  of  the 
joints). Remsima SC is used with methotrexate (a medicine that acts on the immune 
system); 
•  Crohn’s disease (CD) (a disease-causing inflammation of the digestive tract), when the 
disease is moderate to severe or fistulising (with the formation of fistulae, abnormal 
passageways between the gut and other organs); 
•  Ulcerative colitis (UC) (a disease-causing inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the 
gut); 
•  Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (a disease-causing inflammation and pain in the joints of 
the spine); 
•  Psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  (a  disease  causing  red,  scaly  patches  on  the  skin  and 
inflammation of the joints); 
•  Psoriasis (Ps) (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin). 
Further information about the evaluation of Remsima IV/Inflectra IV/Remsima SC’s benefits 
can be found in Remsima IV/Inflectra IV/Remsima SC’s EPAR, including in its plain-language 
summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s

II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks   
Important risks of Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV, together with measures to minimise such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about these risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
•  Different packaging for the different formulations (IV and SC)   
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In case of Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and  regularly  analysed,  including  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR)  assessment,  so  that 
taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
immediate  action  can  be 
pharmacovigilance activities.   
If important information that may affect the safe use of Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV is not 
yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Remsima  IV/SC  and 
Inflectra IV. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the 
medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Serious infections including sepsis   
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
A United States of America (USA) incidence cohort showed that 
RA patients were at risk of developing infections compared with 
non-RA patients. The hazard ratios for objectively confirmed 
infections, infections requiring hospitalisation and any documented 
infection in patients with RA were 1.70 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.42–2.03), 1.83 (95% CI 1.52–2.21), and 1.45 (95% CI 1.29–
1.64), respectively, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, 
leukopenia, corticosteroid use, and diabetes mellitus. Since RA 
patients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, it is not clear 
whether this is related to the underlying disease or the treatment. 
Before the methotrexate and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) era, 
studies showed a general increase in mortality due to infection in 
RA patients. RA appears to increase the risk for bacterial, 
tubercular, fungal, opportunistic, and viral infections, with all 
infections being more common in more active and severe RA. TNF 
acts to regulate and enhance appropriate inflammatory, innate and 
adaptive immune responses to pathogenic organisms and hence 
inhibition of TNF by Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV may 
suppress these beneficial activities of TNF and increase the 
potential for serious infections. Sepsis constitutes a systemic 
Important identified risk: Serious infections including sepsis   
response to infection which is characterised by both a pro-
inflammatory response mediated by cytokines such as TNF and 
Interleukins (IL)-l and an anti-inflammatory indicated by the 
expression of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is a biosimilar medicinal product and 
Remsima SC has the same INN. The reference product for 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is Remicade. The evidence of the 
above-mentioned risk is derived from Remicade RMP and hence 
the strength of the evidence is good. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors for serious infections including sepsis includes 
immunosuppressive medications (such as transplant recipients), 
including steroids, treatment with chemotherapy drugs or radiation, 
splenectomy, longstanding diabetes, acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS), or cirrhosis, large burns or severe trauma and 
infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, cellulitis, urinary tract 
infection. Very young people and elderly people are at risk of these 
infections. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.2 where advice is given that Remsima/Inflectra 
treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which 
Remsima/Inflectra is indicated.   
SmPC section 4.2 where advice is given that patients treated with 
Remsima/Inflectra should be given the PL and the patient reminder 
card. 
SmPC section 4.4 where a warning is given that the patients must 
be monitored closely for infections including TB before, during and 
after treatment with infliximab. 
SmPC section 4.4 where warning is given that the suppression of 
TNF-α may mask symptoms of infection such as fever. Severe 
infections such as sepsis is listed as a contraindication in SmPC 
section 4.3. 
Serious infections including sepsis is listed as special warnings and 
precautions for use in SmPC section 4.4. 
Serious infections including sepsis is listed as an adverse reaction 
in SmPC section 4.8. 
PL section 2 where a warning is given that, tell your doctor if you 
have an infection or if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area 
where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or 
blastomycosis are common before you are given Remsima/Inflectra. 
Serious infection is listed as contraindication and warning and 
precautions in PL section 2.

Important identified risk: BCG breakthrough infection and agranulocytosis in infants with in 
utero exposure to infliximab 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
In infants exposed in utero to infliximab, fatal outcome due to 
disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection has been 
reported following administration of BCG vaccine after birth. 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is a biosimilar medicinal product and 
Remsima SC has the same INN. The reference product for 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is Remicade. The evidence of the 
above-mentioned risk is derived from Remicade RMP and hence 
the strength of the evidence is good. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors for Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) breakthrough 
infection and agranulocytosis includes administration of live 
vaccines to infants in utero which are at risk of BCG breakthrough 
infection and agranulocytosis. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.2 where advice is given that patients treated with 
Remsima/Inflectra should be given the PL and the patient reminder

SmPC section 4.6 where guidance is given that administration of 
live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to infliximab in 
utero is not recommended for at least 6 months after birth and 
cases of agranulocytosis have also been reported. 
Agranulocytosis is listed as an adverse reaction in SmPC section 
4.8. 
PL section 2 where a warning is given that, talk to your doctor if 
you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment 
with a therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used

Important identified risk: Demyelinating disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Demyelinating disorders were identified as a class effect on review 
of the post-marketing data for all TNF inhibitors. After 
demyelinating disorders were identified as a risk, subjects with a 
history of demyelinating disorders were excluded form clinical 
trials. The role that TNF plays as an immunomodulator suggests 
that TNF blockade may promote the development of drug-induced 
neuropathies by augmenting the number of activated peripheral T 
cells and thereby enhance autoimmune responses by altering 
antigen presenting cell function, potentiating T –cell receptor 
signalling, and/or decreasing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells. 
These autoreactive T cells might also drive the maturation of B 
cells into cells secreting autoantibodies to neuronal-specific 
antigens. A recent report in a murine model of experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis suggests that membrane TNF is 
neuroprotective. Since TNF inhibitors can neutralise both soluble 
and membrane TNF, they may remove the neuroprotection 
provided by membrane TNF. 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is a biosimilar medicinal product and 
Remsima SC has the same INN. The reference product for 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is Remicade. The evidence of the 
above-mentioned risk is derived from Remicade RMP and hence 
the strength of the evidence is good.

Important identified risks: Malignancy   
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
According to the Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV SmPC, 
malignancies (some fatal) have been reported among children, 
adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with 
TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy ≤18 years of age), 
including infliximab in the post-marketing setting. A risk for the 
development of malignancies in patients treated with TNF-blockers 
cannot be excluded.   
 
Important identified risks: Malignancy   
In clinical studies with infliximab in which 5,780 patients were 
treated, representing 5,494 patient years, 26 non-lymphoma 
malignancies were detected as compared with 1 non-lymphoma 
malignancy in 1,600 placebo-treated patients representing 
941 patient years. In long-term safety follow-up of clinical studies 
with infliximab of up to 5 years, representing 6,234 patients-years 
(3,210 patients), 38 cases of non-lymphoma malignancies were 
reported. TNF has been shown to exert cytotoxic and/or cytostatic 
effects on a number of human and murine tumour cell lines. Low 
doses of TNF can increase tumour blood vessel permeability, thus 
augmenting tissue concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents, as 
well as enhance the cytolytic effect of NK and CD8+ T cell killing 
of immunogenic tumour cells. Therefore, the neutralisation of TNF 
by infliximab may allow some types of tumour cells to survive. 
Remsima IV/SC and Inflectra IV is a biosimilar medicinal product 
and Remsima SC has the same INN. The reference product for 
Remsima IV and Inflectra IV is Remicade. The evidence of the 
above-mentioned risk is derived from Remicade RMP and hence 
the strength of the evidence is good. 
Risk factor of malignancy in patients includes history of 
malignancy, immunosuppressant therapy, HIV infection. 
Additionally, phototherapy for psoriasis increases the risk of skin 
cancer. Moreover, UC is associated with a higher risk of colon 
cancer. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.4 where warning is given that there is an increased 
background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in RA patients with 
long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which 
complicates risk estimation. 
Malignancy is listed in SmPC section 4.8. 
PL section 2 where a warning is given that, Patients taking 
Remsima/Inflectra may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Tell your doctor if you have or have 
ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer 
before you are given Remsima/Inflectra. 
Cancer in children and adults is listed in PL section 4.

Important potential risks: Colon carcinoma/dysplasia (in paediatric ulcerative colitis) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
In a review of published studies concerning the risk of colon 
carcinoma in UC patients. The crude annual incidence rate of colon 
carcinoma in UC patients ranges from approximately 0.006 to 
0.16%. It is assumed that the more widespread use of maintenance 
therapy for UC and surveillance colonoscopy are the causes of the 
risk decrease. 
TNF has been shown to exert cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects on 
a number of human and murine tumour cell lines. Low doses of 
TNF can increase tumour blood vessel permeability, thus 
augmenting tissue concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents, as 
well as enhance the cytolytic effect of NK and CD8+ T cell killing 
of immunogenic tumour cells. Therefore, the neutralisation of TNF 
by infliximab may allow some types of tumour cells to survive. 
Remsima/Inflectra IV is a biosimilar medicinal product. The 
reference product is Remicade. The evidence of the above-
mentioned risk is derived from Remicade RMP and hence the 
strength of the evidence is good. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patient with UC who have a history of previous colonic 
malignancy are at risk, as are patients with longstanding disease. 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures (Not applicable for SC):

and PLANETRA studies in patients with AS and RA. 
 
Study objectives:   
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  of  Remsima®  in  RA 
patients  by  evaluation  of  events  of  special  interest  (ESI)  up  to  5  years  and  to  exploratory 
compare patients receiving Remsima® with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or other 
anti-TNF drugs. 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy. Further, additional safety of 
Remsima® in RA patients, in comparison with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or 
other anti-TNF drugs will be assessed. Health-economics parameters will also be assessed. 
CT-P13 4.3: An observational, prospective cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of Remsima® in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) 
Purpose of the study:   
Rationale:   
This study is initiated to evaluate and further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of 
Remsima®  treatment  in  patients  with  CD  or  UC  as  part  of  routine  clinical  practice.  Data 
generated in this study will built upon the safety data already generated in the PLANETAS and 
PLANETRA studies in patients with AS and RA. 
Study objectives:   
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Remsima® by evaluation of ESI 
in IBD patients, who have active CD, fistulising CD, or UC for up to 5 years for each patient.   
The  secondary  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  evaluate  additional  safety  and  efficacy  of 
Remsima® in IBD patients. Health-economic parameters will also be assessed. 
CT-P13 4.4: An Observational, Prospective Cohort Study to Evaluate Safety and 
Efficacy of Remsima® in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Purpose of the study:   
Rationale:   
The proposed study is a prospective registry cohort study to compare safety and efficacy over 
5 years  (2  years  initially,  followed  by  an  additional  3  years  for  patients  who  consent  to 
participate in an extension study), between patients with AS who are recipients of Remsima® 
and  patients  receiving  other  TNF  blockers.  Data  generated  in  this  study  will  built  upon  the 
safety data already generated in the PLANETAS and PLANETRA studies in patients with AS 
and RA. 
Study objectives:   
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  assess  the  safety  of  Remsima®  in  AS  patients,  in 
comparison with patients receiving other anti-TNF drugs, by evaluation of ESI for up to 5 years 
from the first visit of each patient.   
The  secondary  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  additional  safety  of 
Remsima®  in  AS  patients,  in  comparison  with  patients  receiving  other  TNF  blockers. 
Health-economics parameters will also be assessed. 
BSRBR-RA: A longitudinal observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
treated with biologic and other new advanced targeted therapies (UK) (Sponsor: 
Celltrion Inc.) 
Purpose of the study:   
Rationale:   
There is an increased risk of premature mortality, serious infection and lymphoproliferative 
malignancy in RA patients. It is therefore important to compare their occurrence in patients on 
new  treatments  compared  to  patients  on  more  established  treatment.  Because  long  term 
immunosuppressive agents such as infliximab have the potential to impact all-cause mortality 
and lymphoproliferative malignancy, long term tracking of this is important. 
Study objectives:   
The major hypotheses to be tested are as follows:   
1.  Primary:  That  any  new  biologic  or  other  new  advanced  targeted  therapy  (defined  as  a 
biologic or other new targeted therapy not previously studied by the BSRBR and which the 
BSRBR  is  currently  recruiting)  in  patients  with  RA  is  associated  with  a  similar  risk  of 
developing  serious  infections  compared  to  patients  with  similar  disease  activity  receiving 
established anti-TNF drugs (i.e. patients receiving Humira, Enbrel, or Remicade).   
2. Secondary: That any new biologic or other new advanced therapy (defined as a biologic or 
other new targeted therapy not previously studied by the BSRBR and which the BSRBR is 
currently  recruiting)  in  patients  with  RA  is  associated  with  a  similar  risk  of  developing 
malignancy and other specified outcomes (such as myocardial infarction) compared to patients 
with  similar  disease  activity  receiving  established  anti-TNF  drugs  (i.e.  patients  receiving 
Humira, Enbrel, or Remicade). 
RABBIT: Long-term Observation of Treatment with Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(Sponsor Celltrion Inc.)

and which the BSRBR is currently recruiting) in patients with RA is associated with a similar 
risk  of  developing  serious  infections  compared  to  patients  with  similar  disease  activity 
receiving established anti-TNF drugs (i.e. patients receiving adalimumab [ADA], etanercept 
[ETA] or infliximab [INF]).   
2. Secondary: That any new biologic or other new advanced therapy (defined as a biologic or 
other new targeted therapy not previously studied by the BSRBR and which the BSRBR is 
currently  recruiting)  in  patients  with  RA  is  associated  with  a  similar  risk  of  developing 
malignancy and other specified outcomes (such as myocardial infarction) compared to patients 
with similar disease activity receiving established anti-TNF drugs (i.e. patients receiving ADA, 
ETA, or INF). 
RABBIT: Long-term Observation of Treatment with Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(Germany) (Sponsor: Pfizer Inc.) 
Purpose of the study:   
Rationale:   
The  German  biologics  register  RABBIT  is  an  independent  long-term  observational  cohort 
study of the safety and effectiveness of biologic agents in RA. The aim of the register is to 
provide safety and effectiveness. Data on all licensed biologic drugs available for the treatment 
of RA are collected in this Registry since 2012. Hospira (Pfizer) entered the registry in 2015. 
Study objectives:   
Major aims are: 
1.  To  study  the  long-term  safety  of  biologic  agents.  This  includes  the  observation  of  all 
adverse  events  (serious  and  non-serious)  in  order  to  assess  the  overall  safety  profile. 
Specific emphasis will be laid on “events of interest”. 
2.  To  describe  the  long-term  effectiveness  of  treatment  with  biologic  agents  (disease 
outcomes on therapy as well as after terminating therapy). Major outcomes are: disease 
activity  score  (DAS)  28  response,  ACR  20/50/70  response,  time  under  therapy,  and 
functional status. 
3.  To  describe  selected  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  therapy  with  biologics  compared  to 
conventional DMARD therapy. This includes the description of health care consumption 
and work disability.

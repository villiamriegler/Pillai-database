2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone 
by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.. It therefore stops the action of the osteoclasts, the 
cells in the body that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue. This leads to less bone loss. The 
reduction of bone loss helps to make bones less likely to break, which is useful in preventing fractures 
in cancer patients with bone metastases. It is also used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal 
women and in men at increased risk of fracture, osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic

glucocorticoid therapy in post-menopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture, and Paget’s 
disease of the bone. 
Patients with tumours can have high levels of calcium in their blood, released from the bones. By 
preventing the breakdown of bones, Zoledronic acid also helps to reduce the amount of calcium 
released into the blood.Zoledronic Acid Hospira is an application made according Generic application 
(Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC) and hybrid application (Article 10(3) of Directive No 
2001/83/EC). For this application, the reference medicinal product authorised in the Community not 
less than 6/10 years ago is Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion and 4 mg/5 ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion, by Novartis Europharm Limited. Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent 
for solution for infusion was authorised in the EU on the 20 March 2001 (EU/1/01/176/001-003). 
Zometa 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion was authorised on the 24 March 2003 as a line 
extension to Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent for infusion (EU/1/01/176/004-006); this license 
belongs to the same global marketing authorisation. Zometa 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion has 
been authorised as a line extension (EU/1/01/176/007-009) under the same global marketing 
authorisation on 24 August 2011, i.e. after the submission of the current application. Aclasta 5 mg/ 
100 ml solution for infusion by Novartis Europharm Limited authorised on 15 April 2005 
(EU/1/05/308/001-002) also belongs to the same global marketing authorisation. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira contains the same active substance as Zometa and Aclasta and is intended for 
parenteral administration; in view of this there is no requirement for bioequivalence testing 
(cf.CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1). 
For Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg /5 ml and 4 mg/ 100 ml, the applicant applied for all the indications 
of the reference product (Zometa) for:  
  Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery 
to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced malignancies involving 
bone. 
  Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).  
For Zoledronic Acid Hospira 5 mg/ 100 ml, the applicant applied for all the indications of the reference 
product (Aclasta) for:  
  Treatment of osteoporosis  
o

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is presented as a 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion in glass or 
plastic vials, with rubber closure, an aluminium seal and flip-off top. It is also presented as a 4 mg/100 
ml and 5 mg/ 100 ml solution for infusion in polypropylene bags with a twist-off port fitted with a cap, 
with an overwrap. 
The full list of ingredients is defined in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Zoledronic acid is a white to off white powder, highly soluble in 0.1N sodium hydroxide solution, 
sparingly soluble in water and 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and practically insoluble in organic solvents. It 
corresponds to the molecular formula C5H10N2O7P2•H 2O and has a molecular mass 290.1 g/mol. The 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
CHMP assessment report

pH of a 0.7% solution of zoledronic acid in water is approximately 2.0. It is hygroscopic and the 
anhydrous of zoledronic acid readily absorbs water to form a stable monohydrate. The zoledronic acid
molecule has no chiral centres and is known to have two polymorphic forms (hydrates) and an 
amorphous form. 
Manufacture 
The information on the active substance is presented in an Active Substance Master File. The 
manufacture of zoledronic acid is performed in four steps including chemical synthesis, crystallisation, 
and filtration, which are described in sufficient detail. The starting materials are commercially ava
and well characterised.  Critical steps and intermediates are presented in a satisfactory manner. 
Information regarding process validation has also been presented and considered acceptable. I
been confirmed by data that zoledronic acid ma
nufactured by the active substance supplier is 
consistent with regard to the crystalline form.

  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml and 5 mg/100 ml solutions for infusion are simple sterile aqueou
solutions for intravenous administration. The product is comprised of a clear, colourless solution, free
from visible particulates, presented in 100 ml polypropylene (PP) infusion bags. The bags are 
closed 
with a PP twist-off closure and protected wi
th a clear overwrap. Both are terminally sterilized 
containing no antimicrobial preservatives. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/5 ml concentrate solution for infusion is available also as a sterile 
aqueous solution. The drug product is comprised of a clear, colourless solution, free from visible 
particulates, presented in either clear plastic vials or clear Type I glass vials. The vial is filled with 5 m
of drug solution and closed with halo-butyl gray elastomeric stopper and aluminium 
seals with plastic 
flip-off tops.  It is also terminally sterilized without any antimicrobial preservatives. 
The active substance attributes that were considered during product development were the water 
hydration in the drug substance and the drug substance solubility as a funct
ion of pH. The active 
substance is highly water soluble at the desired concentration.

The selected excipients are commonly used and are highly water soluble. They were chosen so that no 
pH adjustment is required during solution compounding and also match the reference product. 
Particularly for the 4 mg/ 100 ml strength, excipients also match the reference product in its admixed 
form as intended for administration.  Appropriate comparative testing of the proposed drug product 
and reference product demonstrated equivalence between Hospira and the reference product and 
showed that the two products match key attributes such as potency, pH, osmolality, assay and 
impurities and are therefore considered comparable. 
The product requires no headspace protection during manufacture or in the finished packaging. 
Appropriate development studies were performed to assess the stability of zoledronic acid formulation 
in the proposed polypropylene flexible containers bags under exaggerated stress conditions. 
Stress studies performed during method validation and stability testing at 55°C confirmed that 
zoledronic acid is a highly stable molecule with no evidence of degradation.  
Particulate matter, were below the compendia limit of NMT 6000 particles per container even under 
elevated storage temperature. 
All of the processes utilized in the manufacturing of Zoledronic Acid Hospira are routinely used in 
parenteral drug product manufacturing, including drug weighing and addition, mixing, pH adjustment, 
final dilution, filtration, fill volume, and sterilization. Therefore, there are no key critical process 
parameters that are unique for this drug product. Process validation studies were performed during the 
manufacture of the registration batches to investigate the critical manufacturing parameters. Suitable 
in-process testing is put in place to ensure the quality and the reproducibility of the process. The 
commercial batch sizes have been defined.  
The process verification data demonstrates that the manufacturing process of Zoledronic Acid Hospira, 
4 mg/100 ml and 5 mg/ 100 ml solution for infusion can repeatedly produce a finished product within 
predetermined specifications. 
All the plastic packaging materials used for the product are of medical grade, contain additives that are 
considered safe for use in medical components and meet all the compendial requirements for 
physicochemical and biological safety attributes. Based on data from the developmental stability 
studies conducted, leachables will not be monitored routinely in accordance with ICH Q6A guideline. 
Stress stability studies were performed on the final product at 55°C for 30 days. No evidence of 
migration was noticed. 
The container closure and package integrity have been demonstrated by appropriate studies. 
As the solution for infusion is not reconstituted or admixed with other diluents or drug formulations, no 
compatibility studies were required or performed. Since the solution for infusion is packaged in a semi-
permeable  flexible  plastic  container  and  some  moisture  loss  is  expected  over  the  shelf  life, 
compounding has been properly determined to account for the potential potency gain and to guarantee 
product remains within the desired specifications throughout the entire shelf-life. 
As far as the concentrate is concerned an admixture study was performed to demonstrate that 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira, 4 mg/ 5 ml, when diluted in either 5% Dextrose or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for 
appropriate dosing concentration, as stated in the package insert, is stable for up to 24 hours. 
Particularly with regard to the 4 mg/ 5 ml concentrate, the product is filled in a glass vial as well as a 
plastic vial. The glass vial contains a thin layer of silicon dioxide that provides a barrier between the 
drug and the container surface thereby minimizing the drug interaction with the glass surface and 
eliminating particulate formation. It is noted that the reference product Zometa is packaged in a plastic 
vial. Hospira developed the product in a glass vial in addition to the plastic vial. It is known that 
bisphosphonates have the potential for chelation of residual metal ions, which may otherwise be 
present in glass containers. The metal chelation may manifest in the form of visible particulate 
formation. However, it has been shown that the product can be packaged in a glass container if the 
glass surface is appropriately treated by a thin layer of silicon dioxide that provides a barrier between 
the drug and the container and thereby minimizing the interaction of the product with the glass. The 
results obtained in the relevant feasibility study showed no difference between the two containers and 
indicate that the primary packaging components are appropriate for use. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the formulation of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process follows conventional pharmaceutical practices, which utilise a solution 
compounding step, filtration, filling into vials, and followed by standard Ph. Eur. terminal sterilisation.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/20
 
 
 
 
 
The validation activities have been conducted in compliance with the European GMP and internal 
policies. The results of in-process controls and the analysis of the samples performed at each step 
guarantee the reproducibility of the process. All critical operating parameters associated with the 
manufacturing process were within the qualified parameters of the manufacturing equipment. Based on 
batch analysis data and adequacy of in-process controls, it is considered that the manufacture is 
sufficiently robust to provide assurance that the process produces the finished product of consistent 
quality, complying with the designed specification. 
Furthermore a validation scheme to support the manufacture of commercial scale Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira has been developed and provided. The applicant will conduct prospective process validation on 
the first three consecutive production-scale batches of the product which is acceptable since this is a 
terminal sterilisation process using standard Ph. Eur. conditions. 
Product specification  
The finished product (solution for infusion) release and shelf-life specifications includes tests and limits 
for clarity (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), identification (HPLC, visual colour), 
assay (HPLC), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC),  bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
For the concentrate for solution for infusion the finished product specifications includes in addition to 
the above tests and limits for appearance (visual), osmorality (Ph. Eur.) and fill volume (Ph. Eur.), 
instead of extractable volume. 
Batch analyses data and Certificates of analysis were presented for one commercial and two smaller 
scale batches for each of the two strengths of the solution for infusion. 
Furthermore batch analyses data and certificate of analysis were also provided for three commercial or 
smaller scale batches for each of the two proposed configurations i.e. glass and plastic vial for the 
concentrate. 
For all parameters the obtained results were within the limits defined in the release specification. 
The reported results indicate that the process is under control, confirming consistency and uniformity 
of manufacture. 
Stability of the product 
Solution for infusion 4 mg/ 100 ml and 5 mg/ 100 ml 
Stability studies have been performed on three batches of each strength of the solution for infusion  
under long term 25 °C/40% RH and 30 °C/35% RH and accelerated 40 °C/<25% RH conditions. 
Results have been presented for up to 18 months and for six months under long term and accelerated 
conditions respectively. 
All batches are of the same formulation and presented in the same container-closure system proposed 
for commercial production.  
All attributes used to confirm the quality of the finished drug product on batch release are evaluated 
during stability testing, with the exception of identity.  
The analytical methods used in the stability studies are the same as the methods used for the release 
testing. The assay and impurity methods are stability indicating and have been validated for their 
intended use. 
No significant changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters and at any of storage 
conditions for up to six months compared to the initial values.  All monitored parameters of the drug 
product are within the proposed stability specifications. As expected, an increasing time related trend 
can be observed in assay. This is due to the plastic container being semi-permeable, thus allowing 
some moisture loss. The assay results are within the proposed specification for the drug product. 
In addition, the stability data gained on batches exposed to light and oxygen indicate that the drug 
product is not light or oxygen sensitive. 
Stress Testing 
Stress studies were performed by storing the drug product under freezer conditions for 3 cycles. 
Temperature cycling included storage at -20°C for 48 hours, 25°C for 24 hours, 40°C for 48 hours, and 
25°C for 24 hours. Stability data presented confirm that the drug product is not adversely affected 
under these conditions. 
Forced degradation studies performed during method validation also served to demonstrate the 
stability of Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution for infusion under various extreme conditions including 
acid, base, heat, oxidation and light. The data presented demonstrate that the product is stable and 
not susceptible to degradation. After first opening the product should be used immediately.

Concentrate for solution for infusion 4 mg/ 5 ml  
Stability studies have been performed on six batches of the concentrate for solution for infusion under 
25 °C/40% RH and 30 °C/35% RH for up to 24 months and under 40 °C/<25% RH for six months.  
Three batches were packaged in the in plastic containers and the remaining three batches were 
packaged in glass vials. 
All attributes used to confirm the quality of the finished drug product on batch release are evaluated 
during stability testing, with the exception of identity and fill volume as they are not expected to 
change over time. The acceptance limits for these attributes remain the same as those used to confirm 
the quality of the finished drug product on batch release.  
The analytical methods used in the stability studies are the same as the methods used for the release 
testing. In addition the assay and impurity methods are stability indicating and have been validated for 
their intended use. 
No significant changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters and at any of storage 
conditions compared to the initial values.  All monitored parameters of the drug product are within the 
proposed stability specifications.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion was stress tested with acid, base, heat, 
oxidant (peroxide) and light during the method validation. Photostability testing was performed 
according to ICH guideline Q1B.  
The effects of light stress was evaluated by physical and chemical testing. The 
results indicates that Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/5 ml is not light sensitive, therefore, no special 
instructions need to be added to the package insert regarding the light sensitivity. 
Adequate information demonstrating the compatibility of the concentrate when diluted in 0.9% w/v 
sodium chloride solution and 5% w/v dextrose solution was provided. After aseptic dilution, the diluted 
product should be used immediately. 
The proposed shelf-life and storage conditions based on the available data are accepted for both the 
solution and the concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non- clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Zoledronic Acid Hospira manufactured by Hospira UK Ltd. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all zoledronic acid containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to 
be similar and not increased. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 4mg/5ml zoledronic acid, 
and for solutions for infusion containing 4mg/100ml and 5mg/100ml zoledronic acid. Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira contains the same active substance as Zometa and Aclasta and is intended for parenteral 
administration; in view of this there is no requirement for bioequivalence testing 
(cf.CHMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1). 
GCP 
Not applicable 
Exemption  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/5 ml 
The applied product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same 
active substance as the currently authorised product Zometa 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The applied product also contains the same excipients as Zometa 4mg/5ml concentrate for 
solution for infusion. For this type of product, no bioequivalence studies are required according to the 
Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CHMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev. 1) and the applicant

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of zoledronic acid 4 mg/ 5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion and 5 mg/ 100 ml solution for infusion and a hybrid application for zoledronic acid 
4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion. During the course of the evaluation of the present application the 
pharmaceutical form 4mg/100ml solution for infusion has been authorised as an extension to the 
marketing authorisation of Zometa.   
The reference products are Zometa and Aclasta. 
Zometa is indicated for: 
 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone, 
treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
 
Aclasta is indicated for: 
 
Treatment of osteoporosis  
 
 
in post-menopausal women  
in men  
at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.  
 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  
 
 
in post-menopausal women  
in men  
at increased risk of fracture.  
 
Treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone in adults.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira contains the same active substance as Zometa and Aclasta and is intended for 
parenteral administration; in view of this there is no requirement for bioequivalence testing 
(cf.CHMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1). 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required 
beyond those included in the product information for Zoledronic Acid Hospira 5 mg/ 100 ml indicated in 
the: 
 
Treatment of osteoporosis  
 
 
in post-menopausal women  
in men  
at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.  
 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy  
 
 
in post-menopausal women  
in men  
at increased risk of fracture.  
 
Treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone in adults.

decision that the benefit-risk balance of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg /5 ml and 4 mg/ 100 ml in the:  
 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone. 
 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).

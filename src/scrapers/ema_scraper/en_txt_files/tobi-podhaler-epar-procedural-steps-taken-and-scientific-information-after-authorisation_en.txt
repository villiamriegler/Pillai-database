as a post-authorization measure (PAM) for TOBI Podhaler 
with the aim of addressing the need for long-term data. 
The CHMP concluded that the newly submitted data on 
safety provided by the MAH are consistent with the known 
safety profile of the product and are considered not to 
change the overall benefit/risk of TOBI Podhaler.
The MAH proposal to remove the statement that long-term 
data are not available for TOBI Podhaler in sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant section of the package 
leaflet was accepted.

During the reviewed period, 1 new case of aphonia was 
reported. A total of three cases are available in 
Eudravigilance. The Marketing Authorisation Holder was 
requested to update the Product Information to include the 
adverse event “aphonia”, because:
•
cases detailing the adverse event aphonia with a 
time to onset compatible with a causal relationship between 
aphonia and TOBI Podhaler have been reported, 
•
aphonia might be a more severe form of dysphonia 
which is listed according to the currently approved SmPC 
and the adverse event might be related to the active 
substance and is listed for tobramycin nebuliser solution  
TOBI 300 mg/5 ml (UK/H/0361/001). 
Otherwise no new (potential) safety issue has been 
identified. 
In view of available data regarding aphonia the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information were 
warranted.
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by 
the PRAC.

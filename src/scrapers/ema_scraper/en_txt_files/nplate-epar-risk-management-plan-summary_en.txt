SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Nplate (romiplostim) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Nplate .  The RMP details 
important risks of Nplate, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about Nplate's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Nplate's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Nplate, should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Nplate  should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Nplate
's RMP. 
I.  The Medicine and What it is Used for
Nplate is authorized for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
patients 1 year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (eg, corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins) (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains romiplostim as the active 
substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Nplate’s benefits can be found in Nplate ’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available  on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage.  Link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage:

II.  Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Nplate, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Nplate 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals.
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Nplate, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment  so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Nplate is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Nplate are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns f or 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Nplate .  Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected.

II.B.  Summary of Important Risks  
Important identified risk:  Reoccurrence of low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) 
after stopping Nplate 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
This saf ety concern is specific to the use of romiplostim, was 
characterized by clinical trial data in adult and pediatric patients with ITP 
(f rom either adverse event reports or platelet count values) and has a 
clear biological plausibility. 
There is an increased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is 
discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents.

Important identified risk:  Progression of existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 
MDS is a collection of disorders in which the bone marrow does not produce enough blood 
cells 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Adult ITP clinical trial data do not strongly support this risk, as study 
duration adjusted data show a higher rate of hematologic malignancy or 
MDS in patients receiving placebo compared to romiplostim.  In a 5-year 
f ollow-up of participants in a placebo-controlled study in patients with 
MDS, the rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 
similar in both patient treatment groups

Important identified risk:  Complications related to blood clots (thrombotic/thromboembolic 
complications) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Although there is biological plausibility for this safety concern, in most 
cases reported, the patient platelet count was not in the thrombocytosis 
range.  Clinical trial data reveals similar study duration-adjusted event 
rates f or romiplostim compared to placebo in adults and this risk has 
also been observed in a pediatric ITP study.

To date, most subjects who reported a thrombotic/thromboembolic event 
had similar risk factors as described in the general population.  In most 
cases, the platelet count proximal to the thrombotic/thromboembolic 
event was less than 400 x 109/L.

Important identified risk:  Medication errors 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Although a low number of reports of medication error were received from 
clinical studies, postmarketing data has provided real-world examples of 
the kinds of medication error that are possible. 
Risk f actors and risk

Subjects with ITP receiving (and/or self-administering [adult subjects]) 
treatment with romiplostim.

Important identified risk:  Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
This saf ety concern was identified in the postmarketing setting, but there 
have also been reports from clinical studies.   
Risk f actors and risk 
groups 
Subjects with known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of 
the excipients, or to E coli-derived products would be at increased risk for 
hypersensitivity reactions associated with romiplostim.

Important potential risk:  Immune response (antibodies that cross-react with the protein that 
controls how many platelets are made) (neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with 
endogenous thrombopoietin [eTPO]) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
There is limited evidence for this risk, with a report from a pediatric ITP 
clinical study where a weak positive neutralizing antibody to TPO 
developed, in the absence of an antibody response to romiplostim.  This 
suggested a pre-existing endogenous antibody response to TPO.

Important potential risk:  Concurrent increase in the number of white blood cells

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
There is a biologically plausible mechanism for this safety concern, 
which has occurred in clinical studies.  However, there can be different 
reasons for either leukocytosis or anemia, which happen to occur within 
a 4-week window

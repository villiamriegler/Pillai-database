2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Polatuzumab  vedotin  in  the  initial  MA  application  was  approved  in  combination  with  rituximab  and 
bendamustin for treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL. The present application is an extension of 
indication for first line treatment of DLBCL in combination with Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, 
prednisone. 
Epidemiology   
DLBCL is the most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 30% of 
NHL cases (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998) and 80% of aggressive lymphomas. In 2020, 544,352 new 
NHL cases worldwide were estimated with over 163,000 patients estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL 
(Global Cancer Observatory 2020). While DLBCL is mostly frequently diagnosed between ages of 65 and 
74 years (with median age of 65 years at diagnosis [SEER]), it can also occur in the younger population, 
including children and young adults. 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
DLBCL  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  a  number  of  histologic,  proteomic  and  molecular  subsets  with 
distinctive prognostic profiles, including cell of origin (activated Bcell-like [ABC], germinal center B-cell-like 
[GCB]), elevated protein expression of MYC and BCL2 seen in double-expressing lymphoma [DEL]), and 
gene rearrangements in MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 (double or triple-hit lymphoma [DHL/THL]) (Schmitz 
et al 2018; Scott et al 2015; Lenz et al 2008; Johnson et al 2009; Johnson et al 2012). 
For  the  vast  majority  of  patients,  the  etiology  of  DLBCL  is  unknown.  Hereditary  and  acquired 
immunodeficiencies,  occupational  exposures,  and  pharmacological  immunosuppression  in  the  setting  of 
transplantation or treatment of autoimmune diseases have been identified as factors thought to potentially 
confer increased risk of developing DLBCL.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Initially, DLBCL may be asymptomatic, but it may also be associated with constitutional symptoms such as 
fever, recurrent night sweats, weight loss, and/or local effects of lymph node enlargement, as well as those 
of bone marrow failure (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998). These disease symptoms, along with treatment-
related side effects, often lead to impairments in aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) including 
physical functioning and fatigue (Tholstrup et al 2011). Without treatment, DLBCL is fatal with a median 
survival of approximately 6 months (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 10/174 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Although the biologic features of DLBCL are evaluated in clinical practice and clinical research, they do not 
clearly guide the choice of therapy, as no definitive studies have demonstrated superiority to R-CHOP in 
biomarker-selected populations. While molecular features help to define higher and lower risk subtypes, 
clinical  features  are  also  integrated  into  risk  assessment  and  estimating  prognosis.  The  International 
Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL identifies five patient factors obtained at diagnosis used to stratify 
prognosis and overall survival (OS). The IPI factors reflect clinical features, each representing one point, 
and are a combination of patient characteristics (age >60, ECOG PS >2) and disease-related findings (Ann 
Arbor Stage III or IV, elevated LDH, and extranodal involvement in more than one site).  
Management 
The standard of care therapy for DLBCL involves frontline multi-agent chemotherapy with complementary 
mechanisms of action combined with immunotherapy. Up to 8 cycles of R-CHOP given in 21-day intervals 
(R-CHOP-21), or R-CHOP-like chemotherapy is considered to be the standard of care therapy for patients 
with previously untreated DLBCL. Analyses suggest that 6 cycles is not inferior to 8 cycles (Wästerlid et al 
2018; Sehn et al 2018). 
Since the introduction of R-CHOP there has been limited advancement in treatment options for previously 
untreated DLBCL patients for over 20 years as the majority of randomized studies in previously untreated 
DLBCL have failed to show a benefit. While R-CHOP may cure approximately 60% of patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL (Sehn and Salles 2021), alternative strategies have so far been unable to demonstrate 
meaningful  benefit  over  R-CHOP.  These  include:  increased  dose  density  with  R-CHOP  given  at  14  day 
intervals (Delarue et al 2013; Cunningham et al. 2013); dose intensification with dose-adjusted etoposide 
plus  prednisone,  vincristine,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and  rituximab  (DA-EPOCH-R),  Bartlett  et  al 
2019.  
Thus there is a rationale for introducing novel therapeutic agents that can build upon R-CHOP and improve 
outcomes in patients with previously untreated DLBCL by preventing or delaying relapse. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Polatuzumab  vedotin  (pola)  is  an  antibody-drug  conjugate  (ADC)  that  contains  a  humanized 
immunoglobulin  G1  anti-CD79b  monoclonal  antibody  (MCDS4409A)  and  a  potent  anti-mitotic  agent, 
monomethyl  auristatin  E  (MMAE).  Pola  binds  CD79b,  a  surface  antigen  restricted  to  B-cells  that  is 
ubiquitously  expressed  across  a  majority  of  mature  B-cell  malignancies  including  diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma  (DLBCL).  MMAE  is  a  potent  analog  of  dolastatin  10  that  exerts  its  cytotoxicity  by  binding  to 
microtubules  and inhibiting  microtubule  polymerization,  inhibiting  cell  division,  inducing  apoptosis.  Upon 
binding  to  the  CD79b,  pola  is  rapidly  internalized  to  enable  targeted  delivery  of  MMAE.  This  allows 
microtubule inhibition with greater potency and without additional toxicity.  
In the EU, the initial MAA (procedure EMEA/H/C/004870/0000) for polatuzumab vedotin was granted 
Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) on 16 January 2020 for Polivy in combination with BR for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who are not candidates for haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant. The initial MAA for Polivy was based on data from one pivotal study GO29365, 
performed in a small number of patients and as comprehensive data on the product in the proposed 
indication were not available, the CHMP was of the view that a full marketing authorisation could not be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 11/174 
 
 
 
 
granted. Instead, a conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the CHMP during the 
assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an 
orphan medicinal product. In order to further confirm the safety and efficacy  of polatuzumab vedotin in 
DLBCL  the  MAH  will  provide    Study  GO39942,  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled  trial  that 
evaluates  polatuzumab  vedotin  in  combination  with  R-CHP  (rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin, 
prednisone) versus R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received in the 2017 scientific advice (SA) (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/301908/2017) and was encouraged 
to increase the sample size to achieve higher power, particularly for the analysis of OS. Indeed, there was 
a concern that the lack of power may lead to immature OS results. However, the expected number of OS 
events at study termination was smaller in the study protocol than in the SA (estimated as 178 in protocol 
vs 209 in the SA request), leading to a smaller anticipated power of 52% (vs 62% in SA). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that all studies included in this application were conducted in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The appropriate Ethics Committees 
and Institutional Review Boards reviewed and approved all studies. The studies also took guidelines into 
consideration regarding statistical principles (ICH E9), and EMA and FDA guidelines on clinical trial 
endpoints for the approval of cancer drugs (CPMP/EWP/205/95 Rev. 3 and the FDA Guidance to Industry, 
May 2007). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new data have been submitted in this application which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. As 
the original ERA included in the initial MAA was performed on the basis of a theoretical use of the product 
in the broad indication, a submission of an updated ERA on a potential increase in environmental 
exposure further to this extension of indication was not needed.

DLBCL. The present application aims to characterize polatuzumab vedotin PK as a first line treatment for 
DLBCL in combination with Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, prednisone. 
The clinical PK has been investigated in two clinical studies. Study GO29044 was a phase 1/2 study with 
dose escalation phase followed by a dose expansion phase in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL), including DLBCL previously untreated patients. This was the main study with frequent 
sampling to allow insight in polatuzumab vedotin PK, including the antibody- conjugated MMAE 
(acMMAE), the total antibody, and the unconjugated MMAE. The second study, a phase 3 study GO29042, 
was conducted in previously untreated DLBCL patients with sparse PK sampling for polatuzumab vedotin 
PK characterisation. These PK data were analysed in a pop PK model. The population PK model used was 
the model submitted in the initial application, so called “legacy model”. The additional PK data were 
analysed by external validation using the latter data based on the legacy popPK model. 
Bioanalytical methods: There have been no updates to the polatuzumab vedotin assay method (i.e., no 
additional studies conducted) since the initial MA procedure. It included the measurement of three key 
analytes (conjugate evaluated as antibody-conjugated monomethyl auristatin E [acMMAE], total antibody, 
and unconjugated MMAE) to assess the overall pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin. The acMMAE, 
total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE were quantitated by immunoaffinity HPLC MS/MS in human 
plasma, ELISA in human serum and LC/MS/MS in human plasma respectively. These three bioanalytical 
methods were used in the presented clinical studies: study GO29044 and GO39942 (POLARIX). 
Immunogenicity: There have been no updates to the anti-polatuzumab vedotin antibody assay method 
(i.e., no additional studies conducted) since the initial MA procedure. 
The potential for pola to induce an undesirable immune response was assessed in the available data from 
POLARIX and supportive Study GO29044. The ADA analysis strategy is based on a tiered approach 
designed to detect and characterize ADA responses to polatuzumab vedotin (as well as obinutuzumab in 
study GO29044). 
Patient samples were screened to detect all antibody responses toward polatuzumab vedotin (and 
obinutuzumab in study GO29044). Samples that screened positive were analyzed in a confirmatory assay 
to assess the specificity of the positive response. Titers were determined for confirmed ADA positive 
samples. In study GO39942 (POLARIX), further characterization was assessed by competitive binding 
with the antibody component of pola to characterize whether the ADA responses were primarily to the 
antibody portion, the linker-drug regions, or neo-epitopes of the ADC. 
ICDCBA 106 validation report describes the validation process of the qualitative assay designed to detect 
neutralizing antibodies against polatuzumab vedotin. Neutralizing antibodies are measured in human 
serum through the assessment of caspase 3/7 activity in Human Burkitt lymphoma B cells (BJAB), an 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative B lymphoma cell line transfected. 
The method validation is summarized in the following Table 1.

Study GO29044 
ADAs were assessed at pre-infusion of Cycles 1, 2, and 4, at treatment completion/early termination, and 
at the 3 month follow-up visit. 
The relative sensitivities of the polatuzumab vedotin ADA screening assay were estimated to be 60.1 
ng/mL using an anti-CD79b antibody complementarity determining region monoclonal antibody (positive 
control) and 1141 ng/mL using an anti-auristatin monoclonal antibody diluted in normal human serum. 
The screening assay was optimized to tolerate drug interference. In the presence of 20 µg/mL of 
polatuzumab vedotin, two levels of the positive control sample (90 and 500 ng/mL) tested positive.

The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated by dividing the total number of patients in all study 
groups that tested positive for ADA at baseline by the total number of patients with a valid ADA test 
result at baseline. 
The incidence of ADAs post-baseline in each study group was calculated by dividing the number of 
patients that developed treatment-induced ADAs (i.e., patients with a negative or missing baseline ADA 
result(s) and at least one positive post-baseline ADA result) plus the number of patients that had 
treatment-enhanced ADAs (i.e. the ADA response had increased 0.6 titer units from baseline) in the study 
by the total number of patients with valid post-baseline results in that study group during the study 
period. 
The overall treatment emergent ADA response rate in all polatuzumab vedotin and obinutuzumab 
treatment groups was 0.0%, because there were no observed ADA responses at either baseline or post-
baseline timepoints.  
False-negative ADA response results are unlikely regarding polatuzumab vedotin, as levels of circulating 
ADC were below levels expected to interfere in the assay based on the drug tolerance profile of the assay. 
Table 2 Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Polatuzumab Vedotin in Study GO29044 
Study GO39942 (POLARIX) 
ADAs were assessed at pre-infusion of Cycles 1 and 4, at treatment completion/early termination, and at 
the 3 month follow-up visit. 
The ADA screening and confirmatory assays were optimized to tolerate drug interference and were able 
to detect 100 ng/mL of the positive control sample in the presence of 50 µg/mL of pola. Pola total 
antibody concentrations were determined for each ADA sample. Out of a total of 1125 ADA samples that 
were measured for pola total antibody, 1124 samples had levels less than 50 µg/mL. Pola total antibody 
concentrations ranged from <0.05 µg/mL to 77.6 µg/mL with a median concentration of 1.3 µg/mL. 
Therefore, there is a low likelihood of false-negative ADA results. 
The biological background signal can vary between the samples used to determine the cut points during 
assay validation and the patient population being analyzed. Therefore, in-study screening cut point factor 
(sCPF), confirmatory cut point (CCP), and titer offset were assessed using individual POLARIX baseline 
samples and compared to those determined during assay validation.  
The sCPF, using 307 individuals and targeting a 5% untreated positive rate, was 0.854 with CI90% of 
0.816 to 0.897. The validation sCPF (1.16) was outside the limits of the in-study sCPF; therefore, the in-
study sCPF was implemented. The CCP, using 100 individuals and targeting a 1% untreated positive rate, 
was 40.3% with CI90% of 37.7% to 43.3%. Although the validation CCP (38%) was within the CI90%, it 
was decided to use the in-study cut points for both the sCPF and CCP for consistency. The in-study titer 
offset was also implemented. The titer offset value (0.0626) was based on 4 times the standard deviation 
of the assay signal from 307 individual baseline samples.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 17/174 
 
 
 
 
 
Using the in-study titer offset, the relative sensitivity of the screening assay was estimated to be 27.8 
ng/mL. Using the CCP of 40.3%, relative sensitivity of the confirmatory assay was estimated to be 20.7 
ng/mL. Both the screening and confirmatory assays were able to detect 100 ng/mL of the surrogate 
positive control in the presence of 50 µg/mL of pola. 
For all patients, the baseline prevalence of ADAs was 2.4% (20 of 849 ADA evaluable patients). Post-
baseline, ADAs were detected in 6 of 427 (1.4%) ADA evaluable patients treated with pola (Table 3). All 6 
ADA-positive patients had treatment-induced responses. Out of the 6 patients with treatment-induced 
ADA, 0 patients had a transient response but all had persistent responses. The 8 patients from the 
pola+R-CHP treatment arm who tested positive for ADA at baseline were treatment-unaffected (ADA 
response was similar to, or lower than, that at baseline).

primarily against the linker, drug, or neo-epitopes. Furthermore, all 6 patients with treatment-induced 
ADA were negative for NAb. 
No significant difference in pola PK exposure for acMMAE, total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE was 
observed between ADA positive and ADA-negative patients. Individual pola PK exposure for acMMAE, 
total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE for 6 ADA positive patients were within the range of ADA 
negative patients.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Polatuzumab vedotin PK was characterized in Polivy initial application were the drug conjugate acMMAE, 
the unconjugated drug MMAE, and total antibody PK was characterized. Although the initial application 
target patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients, clinical study GO29044 PK results also included 
DLBCL treatment naïve patients. The PK results, based on NCA analysis were presented in the initial 
application which included 1st line DLBCL PK data collected with the cut-off date of 29/12/2017. 
Polatuzumab vedotin PK in first line DLBCL treatment is thus considered characterised from the initial 
application. The PK results are reminded below in GO29044 study results.  
Study GO29044 was an open-label, dose-escalation Phase Ib/II study with escalating dose phase of 
polatuzumab vedotin (1.0 mg/kg up to 2.4 mg/kg) in combination with a standard regimen of R-CHP or 
G-CHP in patients with B-cell NHL. An expansion phase was added which included newly diagnosed DLBCL 
patients receiving 1.8 mg/kg of polatuzumab vedotin with either R-CHP or G-CHP. PK parameters were 
estimated based on NCA analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.4.0.768 (Pharsight,Inc., Mountain 
View, CA). The estimated parameters were presented in the following table. 
At cycle 1, following 1.8 mg/kg administered intravenously, acMMAE half-life is estimated to 5 days with 
a volume of distribution of 96.5 mL/kg (Vss). Cmax was estimated to 532 (±163) ng/mL and AUCinf to 
1870 (±527) ng/mL*day. The unconjugated drug MMAE reached peak concentration of 2.60 ng/mL within 
5.90 days ranging from 2.87 days to 6.99 days. The variability was low to moderate for acMMAE with 
CV% on Cmax of 30.6% and AUCinf of 28.1%; whereas, as expected, the variability on the unconjugated 
drug was moderate with CV% on Cmax of 39.2%, and AUClast of 46.9%. Overall based on cycle 1, 
polatuzumab vedotin PK in R/R NHL and newly diagnosed DLBCL appears to be comparable.

To further characterize polatuzumab vedotin PK, mainly acMMAE concentration and the unconjugated 
MMAE, pop PK approach (Pop PK report 1111192) was used to characterize PK in subpopulation and for 
exposure-response analyses purposes. Previous popPK model (PopPK Report 1090510) included 
treatment naïve DLBCL patients (study GO29044) developed in the initial application and should be 
applicable to characterize polatuzumab vedotin PK in this population. External validation was 
consequently performed using PK data from study GO39942 (POLARIX) in which only patients with 
treatment naïve patients with DLBCL administered intravenously 1.8 mg/kg Q3W pola for 6 cycles 
concomitant with R-CHP regimen (Pop PK report 1111192). This previously developed integrated 
acMMAE-MMAE model (Model 201) was re-run with all parameters fixed using the data of Study GO39942 
as external evaluation of the formerly established population PK model, further refered to model 301. 
Cross-study comparison of pola PK in R/R DLBCL and 1L DLBCL patients showed the observed acMMAE, 
total Ab and unconjugated MMAE concentrations at C1D1 and C1D4 pre-dose and/or post-dose at 1.8 
mg/kg ,the PK of pola related analytes were found to be overall similar (Table 6).

Methods 
Dataset: study GO39942 
Study GO39942 (POLARIX , Table 1, Figure 1) is an ongoing Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, trial comparing the efficacy and safety of pola plus R-CHP versus R-CHOP in 
previously untreated CD20-positive DLBCL. In the treatment arm, Pola 1.8 mg/kg, placebo for vincristine, 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV, and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV each are 
given on Day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/day orally (PO) is given on Days 1-5 of every 21-day cycle for 6 
cycles. Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV is given as monotherapy in Cycles 7 and 8. 
All patients who had at least one quantifiable acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE concentration value by the 
pharmacokinetic samples analysis data cut-off date (03/16/2021) were included in the analysis. 
Figure 1 Study GO39942 overall design 
A total of 429 patients from Study GO39942 (POLARIX) contributed to 1122 acMMAE and 1175 
unconjugated MMAE concentration values that were used in the external evaluation of the formerly 
established population PK model.  
At Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, only a serum PK sample for total antibody was taken, while at Cycle 1 Day 1 
30-minutes post-dose as well as Cycle 4 Day 1 pre-dose and 30 minutes post-dose, PK samples were 
taken for measuring all the three pola analytes: total antibody (serum, measured by ELISA minimal 
quantifiable concentration 50 ng/mL), antibody-conjugated Monomethyl Auristatin E (AacMMAE, plasma 
measured by immunoaffinity HPLCMS/MS LLOQ 0.359 ng/mL) and unconjugated MMAE (MMAE plasma, 
measured by LCMS/MS 0.0359 ng/mL). In addition, PK samples were taken at treatment completion or 
early treatment termination visit for the three analytes and at 3 month post-treatment follow-up visit for 
for the total antibody only. Summaries of plasma acMMAE, and unconjugated MMAE are presented 
respectively in Table 6 and Table 7.

Anti-drug antibodies to pola were detected in serum samples using a validated bridging enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The screening and confirmatory ADA assays were able to detect 100 ng/mL of a 
surrogate anti-pola antibody in the presence of 50 μg/mL of pola. All patients who had at least one 
quantifiable acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE concentration value by the pharmacokinetic samples analysis 
data cut-off date 16.03.2021 were included in the analysis. 
Covariate definition 
Baseline creatinine clearance (BCRCL) was calculated based on the widely used Cockcroft-Gault formula.  
Renal function category was defined based on creatinine Clearance values, and hepatic function was 
based on The National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group Classification of Hepatic 
Dysfunction classification. 
Summaries of the covariates from the study population are presented in Table 8 for continuous covariates 
and in Table 9 for categorical covariates

Structural model 
The previously developed PK model of pola in patients with NHL (Model 201) was a complex four-
compartment model that consisted of the acMMAE model and the unconjugated MMAE model. The 
unconjugated MMAE model had parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and time-dependent 
relative conversion fraction from acMMAE to unconjugated MMAE (Figure 2). Model 201 parameters 
estimates are reported in Table 9. 
Figure 2 Schematic Representation of Structural acMMAE-MMAE Model (Report 1111192) 
This previously developed integrated acMMAE-MMAE model (Model 201) was re-run with all parameters 
fixed (Table 9) using the data of Study GO39942 as Model 301. The initial model (model 201) parameters 
were initially estimated from 4 studies: Studies DCS4968g in B-NHL patients, studies GO27834, GO29365 
in R/R DLBCL and R/R FL patients (excluding Arm G and Arm H),, and study GO29044 in DLBCL 1st line 
patients. Covariates were investigated and the retained significant covariates were bodyweight, gender, 
race (Asian vs non-Asian) treatment naïve, combination therapy effect, B-cell count effect, tumor SPD, 
prior treatment, threshold B-cells hepatic impairment, ECOG score=0, albumin.

Missing continuous covariates were imputed by the median value of the covariate. There were no 
continuous covariates with more than 15% of missing values. Missing categorical covariates were not 
imputed and were identified as a separate "Missing" category. The imputation flags (1 or 0) were 
provided for the continuous covariates and for the categorical covariates that were derived from 
continuous covariates.  
AcMMAE or unconjugated MMAE post-dose observation below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were 
excluded from the analysis (commented out in the analysis data file). It was not deemed necessary to 
apply a likelihood-based method for handling the BQL data. 
Softwares 
The population PK analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with the NONMEM 
software, Version 7.5.0 (ICON Development Solutions) [9]. The first-order conditional estimation method 
with interaction (FOCEI) was used for all NONMEM model runs.

This model was then externally validated with study GO39942 (POLARIX) based on

Model application 
Simulation modalities 
Model application included comparison of individual PK parameters and exposure measures. Simulations 
were utilized to compute individual exposures using the final population PK model. In the simulation 
procedure, individual values of random effects and individual values of covariates were used. The 
resulting exposures were used to compare exposures between groups of patients. 
Individual empirical Bayes estimates of acMMAE PK parameters were used to estimate Cycle 6 terminal 
half-life (t1/2,term) of the linear part of the acMMAE PK model according to the equations of the two-
compartment linear model, considering that the MM elimination only plays a minor role in the total 
clearance. The equations for estimating t1/2,term are listed below: 
Simulations using individual parameter estimates were used to characterize changes in exposures with 
time from Cycle 1 to Cycle 6 (following six 1.8 mg/kg Q3W doses) and further to Cycle 30 in order to 
estimate time to steady state. 
Impact of Key Variables on Pola PK Exposure Measures 
To support key label claims and filing questions, simulations from the final model were conducted to 
assess the impact of covariates on model projected acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE exposure. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 28/174 
 
 
 
 
 
proposed pola dosing regimen is 1.8 mg/kg Q3W for up to six cycles. Thus, a maximum (and the closest 
to steady-state) acMMAE exposure is expected to be observed at Cycle 6. The exposure at cycle 6 (AUC 
and Cmax), further called the steady state exposure, was used for all comparisons. While Ctrough was 
also computed, it was deemed irrelevant for safety and efficacy, and was not used for comparisons. 
Individual exposure parameters were computed for all patients following simulated 1.8 mg/kg doses Q3W 
for 6 cycles. 
The following covariate categories were compared: body weight (≥ 100 kg. vs. < 100 kg), sex (males vs. 
females), age (≥ 65 vs. <65 years old), race (Asian vs. non-Asian), country (Asia country vs. non-Asian 
country; Asian country vs. Western country; Asian countries vs. rest of the world except Asian and 
Western countries; Taiwan vs. not Taiwan; South Korea vs. not South Korea), hepatic impairment (mild, 
or moderate vs. normal), renal impairment (mild, moderate, or severe vs. normal), ECOG performance 
status (1 versus 0 and 2 versus 1), disease characteristics (bulky vs. not bulky; Ann Arbor stage at study 
entry 3-4-5 vs. 1-2; baseline IPI score 3 vs. 1-2 and 4-5 vs. 1-2; DLBCL subgroup GCB vs. ABC; NHL 
subtypes; Double Expressor by IHC DEL vs. not DEL, baseline LDH levels (above ULN vs. below ULN), 
ADA status (ADA positive versus negative).  
Results  
Comparison of the random effects of PK parameters shrinkage estimated from the initial model, model 
201, and the present model based on study GO39942 PK results are presented in Table 10.  
Bias was noticeable in the distribution of the random effects on the acMMAE to MMAE conversion fraction 
(η7), and the random effects on the residual error (η10 and η11). Shrinkage values are low (<30%) for 
inter-individual random effect on time-independent clearance (η2), central volume (η3), and acMMAE to 
MMAE conversion fraction (η7). Shrinkage of the random effect on time-dependent clearance (η1) was 
moderate (43.5%). For all other parameters, shrinkage of the random effects exceeded 50%. High 
shrinkage of the random effects is likely related to the sparse sampling. 
Low shrinkage values (27.7% and 22.6% respectively) of the random effects on acMMAE time-
independent clearance (η2) and central volume (η3) indicate that computation of the individual Cycle 6 
acMMAE AUC and Cmax values is not shrinking toward the population mean and can be used for the 
exposure-response analysis. 
Although shrinkage of the random effects on unconjugated MMAE model parameters is high, 
unconjugated MMAE exposure is mostly defined by the FRAC parameter, unconjugated MMAE central 
volume (for unconjugated MMAE Cmax value), and by the ratio of CLMMAE/FRAC (for unconjugated 
MMAE AUC value). Shrinkage of the FRAC parameter is low (19.3%), and unconjugated MMAE central 
volume does not have the random effect. The expected value of CLMMAE/FRAC variance is the sum of 
CLMMAE and FRAC variances estimated by the model (equal to 0.212) while the observed variance of the 
ratio is the variance of the difference η8-η7 (equal to 0.161). Due to the high correlation of the random 
effects on CLMMAE and FRAC, the resulting shrinkage of the ratio of CLMMAE/FRAC is low (13.0%). Thus, 
unconjugated MMAE AUC and Cmax values are not shrinking toward the population mean and can be 
used for the exposure response analysis.

The diagnostic plots are presented in Figure 4 for ac MMAE, and Figure 5 for unconjugated MMAE. The 
NPDE, and VPCs plots for both acMMAE, and unconjugated MMAE are presented in Figure 6, and Figure 7 
respectively. The visual predictive check plots show an acceptable agreement between the simulated and 
observed acMMAE data. The visual predictive check plots for unconjugated MMAE show acceptable 
agreement between the simulated and observed data for the 10th percentile and the median, while the 
model over-estimated 90th percentile of observed data, especially at the first sampling point two hours 
after the first dose. A higher than observed variability of time-dependent acMMAE clearance estimated by 
the legacy model and higher than observed residual variability may explain the difference. The model was 
developed on a more diverse data set leading to higher than observed variability of predicted 
unconjugated MMAE concentrations following the first dose. As steady-state is approached (e.g., Cycle 4 
Day 1 post-dose samples at nominal time of 1513 hours after the fisrt dose), differences of observed and 
simulated unconjugated MMAE concentrations are much smaller. A total of 96%, 60%, and 13% on NPDE 
values were above 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the expected acMMAE NPDE distribution. A total of 
93%, 44%, and 4% on NPDE values were above 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the expected 
unconjugated MMAE NPDE distribution.

Model application 
acMMAE PK properties 
• 
• 
The median (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) terminal half-life of acMMAE in patients included in the 
analysis (estimated based on the values of the linear clearance at Cycle 6) was 11.8 (10.0-13.2) 
days. 
The acMMAE AUC and Ctrough increased mildly with repeated Q3W dosing, due to the decrease of 
acMMAE clearance with time. Based on the population PK simulations of exposures for each cycle 
up to 6 cycles of 1.8 mg/kg Q3W dose, the acMMAE Cycle 3 AUC and Ctrough (i.e., Cycle 4 day 1 
pre-dose) were approximately 1.3 and 1.8 fold of the values at Cycle 1 AUC and Ctrough (i.e., 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 34/174 
 
 
 
 
 
Cycle 2 day 1 predose); the Cycle 6 values were approximately 1.4 and 2.2 fold of the values at 
Cycle 1. There were no apparent increase in Cmax values. 
•  Based on the population PK model simulation, the Cycle 3 acMMAE AUC, Cmax and Ctrough (i.e., 
Cycle 4 day 1 pre-dose) values were 92%, 99% and 82% of Cycle 6 AUC, Cmax and Ctrough 
(Cycle 6 day 21) values, which were the maximum acMMAE exposures for the proposed dosing 
regimen of up to 6 cycles of treatment. In turn, Cycle 6 acMMAE AUC, Cmax and Ctrough values 
are 90%, 99% and 80% of the model estimated steady-state AUC, Cmax and Ctrough values 
(represented by the simulated value for the exposure during hypothetical Cycle 30 after repeated 
Q3W dosing, at which time the CLNS approximated CLINF). 
Unconjugated MMAE PK properties 
•  An integrated acMMAE-MMAE population PK model well described PK of unconjugated MMAE. 
Unconjugated MMAE demonstrated formation rate limited kinetics. Unconjugated MMAE exposures 
decreased after repeated dosing of pola, which is empirically fitted by a reduction of relative 
fraction of formation of unconjugated MMAE from acMMAE (FRAC) with time. 
•  Unconjugated MMAE AUC and Cmax decreased, potentially due to decrease of acMMAE clearance 
and decrease of relative fraction of formation of MMAE from acMMAE (FRAC) with time. Based on 
the population PK simulations of exposures for each cycle up to 6 cycles of 1.8 mg/kg Q3W dose, 
AUC and Cmax values were the highest in Cycle 1 after which they declined. The unconjugated 
MMAE AUC and Cmax at Cycle 3 are approximately 66% and 55% of the values at Cycle 1; the 
Cycle 6 values are approximately 64% and 51% of the values at Cycle 1. The Ctrough values are 
low (<0.5 ng/mL). 
Special populations 
Simulation of Cycle 6 exposures (AUC, Cmax) based on individual empirical Bayes estimates of PK 
parameters were performed. Heavy patients (body weight >= 100 kg) had mildly higher acMMAE 
exposures (14% for AUC, 18% for Cmax) and higher unconjugated MMAE exposures (54% for AUC and 
48% for Cmax). Age, sex, race (Asian versus non-Asian), region (Asian country versus non-Asian 
country), renal function impairment (mild or moderate impairment), ECOG performace status, disease 
characteristics (bulky disease, Ann Arbor stage; IPI score, DLBCL subgroup, Double Expressor by IHC, 
LDH) were not associated with clinically relevant difference of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE 
exposures. 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment had similar acMMAE exposures to patients with normal hepatic 
function but moderately higher unconjugated MMAE exposures (46% higher for AUC and 35% for Cmax). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Polatuzumab was evaluated as a potential victim and perpetrator of a PK drug–drug interaction with 
rituximab (R)/obinutuzumab (G)-CHP (GO29044 study). Prednisone was not assessed in this analysis 
given the wide therapeutic window of steroids and low risk for pola as a perpetrator of a PK DDI for 
prednisone. 
Study GO29044 is a phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label, and dose-escalation study (NCT01992653). 
Patients with B-NHL received six or eight cycles of pola 1.0–1.8 mg/kg + R/GCHP (21-day cycles; R/G-
CHP was given as per the standard regimen). Patients were given either six or eight cycles of treatment 
based on the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local institutional practice.

Polatuzumab was assessed as a DDI ‘victim’ of CHP by comparing pola exposure with data from previous 
studies as a comparator, which included Study GO27834 where pola was administered with 
rituximab/obinutuzumab in the absence of CHP. Patients in Study GO27834 followed the same pola PK 
sampling scheme in comparison to GO29044 study. 
Exposure comparisons included Cycle 1 Cmax and AUC of each polatuzumab vedotin analyte (acMMAE, 
total antibody, and unconjugated MMAE). The results are presented in both Table 11 & Table 12. The 
latter is taken from Shemesh et al. (2020) and provides data on variability as 90% confidence intervals 
associated with central values. Although taken from the same studies, the results presented in Table 11 & 
Table 12 are not based on the same number of patients.

Table 13 Assessment of CHP as a perpetrator of a PK DDI with 1.8 mg/kg of pola as a victim based on C1 
non-compartmental analysis results (Shemesh et al., 2020) 
For exposure assessments of pola + R-CHP compared with pola combined with rituximab (without CHP), a 
direct comparison in patients of the same B-NHL type was not possible. However, given DLBCL and FL 
patients have generally similar PK for pola, a cross-study comparison of available data was conducted. 
In both arms, Cycle 1 PK differences were within the PK variability of each analyte and could also be 
attributed to differences in patient characteristics (especially in the case of histological non-similarity). 
Furthermore, given the acceptable safety profiles of all treatment arms, the applicant considers that the 
observed PK differences were not considered as clinically meaningful after the first 1.8-mg/kg dose of 
pola + R/G-CHP vs. pola + R/G. 
The applicant concludes that polatuzumab was not a victim of a drug–drug interaction with CHP.  
PK of rituximab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and CHP 
To evaluate pola and CHP as ‘perpetrators’ for DDIs with rituximab, data were compared with those for 
rituximab exposure from historical studies, e.g. study BO22334 (NCT01200758). 
According to the applicant, the mean serum concentrations of rituximab approximating steady-state 
conditions, (Cycle 4 pre-dose) in DLBCL patients within Study GO29044: 70.2 (23.5) µg/mL (N = 22) 
were generally comparable to those seen in Study BO22334 (R + CHOP): 66.2 (30.5) µg/mL (N = 197) in 
the absence of polatuzumab vedotin, and were also comparable to Study GO27834 (pola + R): 82.0 
(29.4) µg/mL (N = 18) in the absence of CHP at the same time point, in similar patient populations. In 
conclusion, the applicant states that no significant impact of the combination on rituximab PK was 
observed either due to the administration of polatuzumab vedotin or CHP, based on the cross-study 
comparison of rituximab exposure. 
Shemesh et al. (2020) presents mean rituximab serum C4 pre-dose concentration comparison between 
study GO29044 and study BO22334 (Table 13). Differences observed with cross-study comparison of 
rituximab exposure are within the variability of rituximab observed in study BO22334 (up to 111%). The 
authors drawn a similar conclusion to the applicant, i.e. no significant impact of the combination on 
rituximab PK was observed either due to the administration of polatuzumab vedotin or CHP.

PK of obinutuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and CHP 
To evaluate pola and CHP as ‘perpetrators’ for DDIs with obinutuzumab, data were compared with those 
for obinutuzumab exposure from historical studies, e.g. study BO21003 (NCT00576758). 
First, matching obinutuzumab dosing regimens for patients with DLBCL in Study GO29044 up to cycle 2 in 
patients with B-NHL in Study BO21003 allowed for a cross-study comparison of pola + G-CHP to single-
agent obinutuzumab therapy based on cycle 2 pre-dose & cycle 1 mean Cmax concentrations. Therefore, 
comparison of Cycle 1 obinutuzumab Cmax and Cycle 2 pre-dose concentrations in patients with DLBCL in 
Study GO29044 receiving (pola + G-CHP) versus Study BO21003 (G) were evaluated. 
In the study GO29044 body report, the applicant states that “small numerical inter study differences in 
Cycle 2 pre-dose obinutuzumab PK between Study GO29044 and Study BO21003 were seen” without 
further details. In the other hand, it is specified that the cycle 1 mean Cmax for DLBCL patients receiving 
pola + G-CHP in Study GO29044 was approximately 20% higher than the mean Cmax within NHL 
patients in Study BO21003 receiving G-monotherapy. 
Furthermore, comparisons of serum obinutuzumab Cmax in Cycles 1 and 4 and pre-dose in Cycles 2 and 
4 show generally comparable PK between the pola + G-CHP regimen in Study GO29044 and the pola + G 
regimen in Study GO27834 with mean maximal differences across all observations of less than 20% 
observed. 
According to the applicant, the addition of CHP to the pola + G regimen does not appear to substantially 
impact obinutuzumab PK. 
Shemesh et al. (2020) presents mean obinutuzumab serum C2 pre-dose concentration comparison 
between study GO29044 and study BO21003 (Table 14). The observed difference in GMR values was well 
within the variability of obinutuzumab (60% CV in Study BO21003), and may reflect variability in body 
weight, gender, and tumor burden due to differences in patient populations between the studies (e.g., 
DLBCL in GO29044 vs. R/R indolent B-cell NHL in BO21003).

PK of cyclophosphamide in combination with rituximab (or obinutuzumab), polatuzumab 
vedotin, doxorubicin and prednisone 
Polatuzumab was assessed as a ‘perpetrator’ of DDIs with cyclophosphamide by comparing 
cyclophosphamide between cycle 1, day 1 (prior to first pola dose on cycle 1, day 2) and cycle 3, day 1 
(after pola dosing). Plasma PK concentrations of cyclophosphamide were evaluated at the end of infusion 
and at 3 and 23 hours after the first dose and after Cycle 3 in patients with DLBCL receiving 1.8 mg/kg of 
pola + R/G-CHP in the Phase II expansion portion of the study. 
Comparisons of Cycle 1 exposures of cyclophosphamide (prior to polatuzumab vedotin administration) 
were similar to those in Cycle 3 (after polatuzumab vedotin administration). Cyclophosphamide was

administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1, with polatuzumab vedotin administered on Day 2 of Cycle 1; while on 
Day 1 of Cycle 3 both analytes were administered on Day 1. These results suggest that polatuzumab 
vedotin does not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide when 
given in combination.

PK of doxorubicin in combination with rituximab (or obinutuzumab), polatuzumab vedotin, 
cyclophosphamide and prednisone 
Polatuzumab was assessed as a ‘perpetrator’ of DDIs with doxorubicin by comparing doxorubicin 
exposure between cycle 1, day 1 (prior to first pola dose on cycle 1, day 2) and cycle 3, day 1 (after pola 
dosing). Plasma PK concentrations of doxorubicin were evaluated at 2 and 24 hours after the end of 
infusion after the first dose and after Cycle 3 in patients with DLBCL receiving 1.8 mg/kg of pola + R/G-
CHP in the Phase II expansion portion of the study. 
Comparisons of Cycle 1 exposures of doxorubicin (prior to polatuzumab vedotin administration) were 
similar to those in Cycle 3 (after polatuzumab vedotin administration). Doxorubicin was administered on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, with polatuzumab vedotin administered on Day 2 of Cycle 1; while on Day 1 of Cycle 3 
both analytes were administered on Day 1. These results suggest that polatuzumab vedotin does not 
have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin when given in combination.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Polatuzumab vedotin (pola) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that contains a humanized 
immunoglobulin G1 anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody (MCDS4409A) and a potent anti-mitotic agent, 
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Pola binds CD79b, a surface antigen restricted to B-cells that is 
ubiquitously expressed across a majority of mature B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL). MMAE is a potent analog of dolastatin 10 that exerts its cytotoxicity by binding to 
microtubules and inhibiting microtubule polymerization, inhibiting cell division, inducing apoptosis. Upon 
binding to the CD79b, pola is rapidly internalized to enable targeted delivery of MMAE. This allows 
microtubule inhibition with greater potency and without additional toxicity.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Based on study GO39942 POLARIX, , exposure response analyses following dose of 1.8 mg/kg Q3W of up 
to 6 cycles given in combination with R-CHP, were conducted to assess  
- 
efficacy based on (Progression Free Survival) PFS, Event-Free Survival (EFSeff), Overall Survival 
(OS), and Complete response at end of treatment by FDG-PET as determined by blinded 
independent central review (CREOT) 
- 
safety based on  Grade ≥ 3 Neutropenia, Peripheral Neuropathy, Infections and Infestations; 
Anemia; Thrombocytopenia; AST increase (by lab); ALT increase (by lab); Bilirubin increase (by 
lab); Hepatic toxicity; Hyperglycemia; Cardiac Arrhythmia. 
Methods 
Pop PK model developed for polatuzumab vedotin was validated in patients newly diagnosed DLBCL in 
report 1111192. This model was subsequently used to simulate individual exposure for exposure-
response analysis. The individual PK parameters estimated using the final population PK model and the 
relevant PK covariates for each subject were used to simulate individual concentration-time course 
following pola Q3W administration for a total of 6 cycles to compute individual exposure values in Cycle 6. 
Nominal (1.8 mg/kg) dose was used for each patient in the simulation. AUC and Cmax values of acMMAE 
and unconjugated MMAE in Cycle 6 were used as exposure measures for the exposure-response analyses 
as described in Table 17. AUC and Cmax were defined as AUC and Cmax over 21 day in Cycle 6 using 
nominal dose specified by the cohort assignment. 
For some of the analyses (described in the following sections), categories of exposure (where patients 
were divided into 2 or 3 groups of equal size based on exposure) were evaluated in addition to continuous 
exposure measures.  
Dataset:  
Study GO39942 POLARIX; results were used in the exposure-response relationship.  
Mathematical modeling 
For safety and efficacy the modeling approach used, and the PK parameter used for exposure analyses 
are presented below:

Table 18 Model used for exposure response analyses 
Exposure – Safety response 
Endpoints with less than 5% incidence rate were excluded from the analysis. For each AE type, linear 
logistic regression models were implemented to assess the relationship between the probability of AE 
occurrence and pola exposure for acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE. The p-value as provided by the glm() 
function was used to evaluate whether or not the tested exposure metric was significant in the model at 
the significance level of α = 0.05. If a significant increase for probability of an AE with increasing 
exposure was detected, a covariate analysis was conducted using the relevant covariates described 
belowCovariates were added linearly in the logit scale: 
logit(p) = a0+a1∙COV + b0∙exposure. (Eq.1) 
To define the confidence interval for the model predicted probabilities, 1000 bootstrap samples were 
drawn with replacement from the analysis population, and the logistic regression models were fitted to 
each of these samples. For each value of exposure, 90% confidence intervals were defined as the 5th and 
95th percentiles of the model predicted probabilities among 1000 bootstrap data sets. Distributions for 
time of the first AE occurrence were plotted and summarized to assess the acute or chronic feature of 
each AE. 
The data sets for the exposure-safety analysis also included the following dose intensity related 
endpoints: occurrence status for the dose modification of pola due to AE (1 or 0), time for the first dose 
modification of pola due to AE (or censoring time if no event), dose intensity for pola, rituximab, 
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. 
The dose modifications included reduction, delay, or discontinuation. The probability of dose modification 
due to AE was investigated using the logistic regression analysis, as described above. The time to first 
modification due to AE was investigated using the time-to-event analysis.  
Dose intensity (%) accounted for dose delay and dose reduction. It was computed based on the actual 
doses administered to each patient up to the end-of-treatment assessment relative to the planned dose. 
The early discontinuation was not accounted in the dose intensity calculation. Only dose delays were 
allowed for rituximab. The impact of exposure on dose intensity of pola, rituximab, doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, and prednisone was investigated by the linear regression, lowess regression, and by

comparison of distributions of intensity values between categories of exposure (tertiles) using box plots. 
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, range, geometric mean [Geomean], 
coefficient of variation [CV]) stratified by categories of exposure were also provided. P-values of the 
linear regression models were used to assess significance of the exposure-dose intensity relationships at 
the significance level of α = 0.05. 
Exposure – efficacy response  
The logistic regression analysis (as described in Section 4.3.4) was implemented to assess the 
relationship of the probability of complete response with exposure. The covariate analysis was performed 
(using the covariates listed in Section 4.3.1) if a significant effect of exposure was detected at 0.05 level, 
using the strategy described in Section 4.3.4. 
Two analyses were performed for each survival measure. In the first analysis, Kaplan- Meier plots were 
performed to compare the survival probability over time for patients with low and high exposure 
(categorized by the median value of acMMAE AUC) and also for patients in the control arm (R-CHOP). In 
the second analysis, the exposuresurvival relationships were described by semi-parametric Cox 
proportional hazards (CPH) models. The control arm was not used in these models. 
The CPH relationships between exposure (acMMAE AUC) and EFSeff, PFS, or OS were first characterized 
using base models that described the marginal effect of exposure on survival without consideration of 
covariates. The hazard functions were expressed as: 
, (Eq.2) 
where λ0(t) is the baseline hazard function and is a vector of predictor variables (covariates). For the 
base model, the vector of predictor variables consisted of a continuous exposure variable (acMMAE AUC). 
The parameters of vector were estimated by maximum partial-likelihood. 
The P-value as provided by coxph() function was used for significance evaluation of exposure coefficients 
at the significance level of α = 0.05. Covariates were added linearly in the log hazard scale. 
Covariate testing 
Covariate selection. 
The forward addition and backward elimination procedure was implemented for covariate screening. A 
significance level of α = 0.01 (the objective function change of 6.64 points for one parameter) was used 
for forward addition procedure while backward elimination steps used α = 0.001 significance level (the 
objective function change of 10.83 points for one parameter). The exposure was always kept in the model 
during the backward elimination steps.  
The following covariates were tested  
•  Demographics: body weight, sex, age, race, region; 
•  Baseline Laboratory Measurements: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum albumin, B-cell (CD19) 
count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil count, hemoglobin level (HGB), platelet 
count; 
•  Baseline disease characteristics and history: ECOG performance status, bulky disease, tumor 
SPD, Ann Arbor stage, NHL subtype, DLBCL cell origin, International prognostic index (IPI) 
score, double-expressor by IHC status, extra nodal involvement, active peripheral neuropathy 
status, baseline peripheral neuropathy active status; 
•  Anti-drug antibody (ADA) status for pola.

Missing continuous covariates were imputed by the median value of the covariate. Missing categorical 
covariates were set to a separate "Missing" category. The imputation flags (1 or 0) were also provided for 
the categorical covariates that were derived from continuous covariates and for the continuous 
covariates. 
The following covariates were included only in the exposure-efficacy analyses as they were not expected 
to affect safety: B-cell (CD19) count, NLR, tumor SPD, Ann Arbor stage (stage 1-2 vs. stage 3 vs. stage 
4-5), DLBCL cell origin (ABC vs. GCB vs. unclassified or unknown), double-expressor by IHC status (DEL 
vs. no DEL), IPI score (IPI 1-2 vs. 3 vs. 4-5), and bulky disease (yes versus no). 
The following covariates were included only in the exposure-safety analyses: baseline neutrophil count for 
the analysis of neutropenia; baseline hemoglobin level for anemia; baseline platelet count for 
thrombocytopenia; peripheral neuropathy history and peripheral neuropathy status at baseline for 
peripheral neuropathy.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, polatuzumab vedotin PK was characterized in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients in POLARIX study, 
and based on Pop PK analysis. Despite some clarification needed in the pop PK model validation, based on 
the provided study results, it is not expected that the PK of polatuzumab vedotin will be significantly 
different in DLBCL patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin in first-line. 
Polatuzumab vedotin is indicated for first-line treatment of DLBCL in combination with R-CHP. The PK 
interaction between the administered drugs were assessed. In vivo DDI studies show that polatuzumab 
vedotin does not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin nor 
cyclophosphamide when given in combination. However, given the confounding variabilities associated to 
the other DDI studies design, no clear conclusion can be drawn for polatuzumab vedotin potential 
interaction as perpetrator (i.e. on rituximab and obinutuzumab PKs) or victim (i.e. with –CHP as 
perpetrator). The applicant was invited to more soundly discuss the comparability of each study to study 
GO29044 in order to potentially manage DDI risks. 
Among 435 previously untreated DLBCL patients treated with Polivy in combination with R-CHP in Study 
GO39942, 227 (52.2%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Patients aged ≥ 65 had an incidence of serious adverse 
reactions of 39.2% and 28.4% in patients aged < 65. A similar incidence of serious adverse reactions was 
seen in elderly patients in the R-CHOP treatment arm.  
Exposure-safety analysis suggested that higher acMMAE exposures (AUC and Cmax) were significantly 
correlated with higher incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy, Grade ≥ 3 anemia (only AUC), and 
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia. The covariate analyses were performed only for the acMMAE AUC models. 
The forward-addition procedure identified HGB and LDH as the significant covariates for Grade ≥ 3 
anemia at α = 0.01 level. Patients with higher baseline HGB had lower probability of Grade ≥ 3 anemia. 
Patients with higher baseline LDH had higher probability of Grade ≥ 3 anemia. The exposure-response 
relationship remained significant in the presence of these covariates. HGB was retained in the model at α 
= 0.001 level during the backward elimination. 
Higher unconjugated MMAE exposures (AUC, Cmax) were significantly correlated with higher incidence of 
Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 infections and infestations, Grade ≥ 3 anemia, Grade ≥ 3 
thrombocytopenia, and Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia. The covariate analyses were performed only for 
the unconjugated MMAE AUC models. The forward-addition procedure identified HGB as a significant 
covariate for Grade ≥ 3 anemia, and Asian race for Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia at α = 0.01 level. Patients 
with higher HGB had lower probability of Grade ≥ 3 anemia, and Asian patients had higher probability of 
Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia. The exposure response relationship remained significant in the presence of these 
covariates in the model; both covariates were retained in the final model at α = 0.001 level during 
backward elimination. 
Exposure-Efficacy cox analysis suggested a significant correlation (p = 0.01 by Cox regression) between 
acMMAE AUC and EFSeff, with higher exposure leading to a longer EFSeff. The forward-addition 
procedure identified baseline bulky disease as a significant covariate at α = 0.01 level. The exposure-
response relationship remained significant in the presence of this covariate in the model. Only bulky 
disease remained in the final model at α = 0.001 level during the backward elimination. 
The Cox analysis suggested no significant correlation between acMMAE AUC and OS. Probability of 
complete response at the end of treatment did not correlate with acMMAE exposure (AUC).

In Studies GO39442 (POLARIX) and GO29365, 1.4% (6/427) and 5.2% (12/233) of patients tested 
positive for antibodies against polatuzumab vedotin, respectively, of which none were positive for 
neutralizing antibodies. 
Sections 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated accordingly.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the submitted clinical pharmacology studies are considered sufficient to characterize 
polatuzumab vedotin in the indication of first-line DLBCL treatment in combination with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, and prednisone.

Doxorubicin, and Prednisone in Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. 
First Patient Enrolled: 29 November 2013 Last patient last visit: 20 December 2018 
In the dose-finding portion of the study, the MTD of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab or 
obinutuzumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisolone or prednisone [R-CHP 
or G-CHP] was determined. Following identification of the MTD, the dose-expansion portion of the study 
further  evaluated  the  safety  and  tolerability  and  clinical  activity  of  R-CHP  or  G-CHP  plus  polatuzumab 
vedotin in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. 
The primary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of pola+ 
R-CHP or G-CHP and to determine the MTD and schedule for pola+ R-CHP or G-CHP. 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study were the following: to make a preliminary assessment of 
efficacy as measured by CR rate determined by PET-CT scan, OR Rate, DOR, PFS, EFS and OS, to assess 
the potential relationships of such ADA formation with efficacy outcome measures 
The  exploratory  efficacy  objectives  of  this  study  were  the  following  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  therapy  in 
different  potential  prognostic  subgroups,  including  DLBCL  genotypic  subtypes  (e.g.  ABC,  GCB)  and  high 
Bcl-2  expression,  to  assess  tumor  expression  of  CD79b,  to  assess  prevalence  and  the  correlation  of 
lymphoma  associated  mutations  with  outcome,  to  assess  MRD  as  quantified  by  measurements  of 
lymphoma-specific  markers  in  peripheral  blood,  to  evaluate  the  prognostic  significance  of  interim  PET 
assessment,  to  evaluate  response,  by  IRC,  as  determined  through  use  of  the  PET-CT  scans  based  on  a 
modified version of the Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2014), hereinafter 
referred to as Modified Lugano 2014 criteria (CR by PET at end of induction (EOI) by IRC, CR by CT at EOI 
by IRC, OR (defined as a CR or PR) at EOI, best response of CR or PR during the study, evaluate patients 
who have positive PET scans at EOI: CR at 12 months). 
Design:    Two  parallel  treatment  arms  explored  doses  of  pola+R-CHP  and  G-CHP.  The  MTD  or  RP2D  of 
polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP was identified before it was combined with G-CHP. This 
was an open-label study.

Study treatment was given in every-21-day cycles, with the first day of treatment constituting Day 1 of the 
cycles. Patients were treated for a total of six or eight cycles in accordance with local institutional practice. 
Figure 16: Overview of Study Design 
Once a dose was identified for the expansion stage, the study restricted enrollment to a group of patients 
with high medical need (newly diagnosed DLBCL patients who were aged ≥18 years and who had an IPI of 
2-5) to further assess safety and efficacy of the combination.  
The  dose  escalation  of  polatuzumab  vedotin  combined  with  R-CHP  began  at  a  dose  level  of  1.0  mg/kg, 
because this was the highest dose level at which no DLTs or clinically significant AEs were observed during 
the Phase I study (Palanca-Wessels et al. 2015). The MTD of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-
CHP  was  identified  before  it  was  combined  with  G-CHP.  Once  the  MTD  was  determined,  polatuzumab 
vedotin was dosed at MTD-1 in combination with G-CHP to start the dose escalation of this combination.  
Rituximab was administered after the prednisone/prednisolone dosing and before the cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin,  and  polatuzumab  vedotin  infusions.  Six  to  eight  cycles  of  rituximab  at  375  mg/m2  were 
administered IV to patients every 21 days (or over 28 days for those patients who experienced toxicity that 
necessitated an extended cycle duration). No dose modifications of rituximab were allowed.

Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 was administered IV on Day 1, Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and 
Prednisone 100 mg/day by PO on Days 1-5.  
Main inclusion criteria 
- Dose-Escalation Portion of the Study: Histologically confirmed B-cell NHL: Patients with newly diagnosed 
B-cell  NHL  or  relapsed/refractory  B-cell  NHL  were  eligible,  No  more  than  one  prior  systemic  treatment 
regimen for B-cell NHL (single agent anti-CD20 MAb therapy was not counted as a prior treatment regimen), 
No prior treatment with anthracyclines 
- Expansion Portion of the Study: Previously untreated patients with DLBCL, IPI score of 2-5. 
Statistical Hypothesis and Planned Sample Size 
Since there was no pre-specified hypothesis, whether or not the efficacy endpoints were met could not be 
assessed using statistical tests. The sample size required for estimating the MTD was based on the dose-
escalation  rules.  All  dose-escalation  cohorts  will  consist  of  at  least  3  patients.  If  a  DLT  is  observed  in  1 
patient at a given dose level during the DLT observation period before dose escalation, additional patients 
will  be  enrolled  at  that  dose  level  for  a  total  of  at  least  6  patients.  Protocol  version  8  discontinued 
enrollments in the pola +G-CHP arm at 17 patients and the total number of patients in the expansion arm 
was approximately 60, instead of 80. The decision to discontinue enrollment in the pola+G-CHP arm was 
made because of final results from Study BO21005 (GOYA) which showed no additional efficacy benefit of 
G-CHOP compared to R-CHOP as determined by the study’s primary endpoint of investigator assessed PFS. 
Regarding  efficacy  data,  CR  rate  was  estimated  by  the  number  and  percentage  of  responders  with 
corresponding 90% CIs was presented. Estimates of the median PFS, DOR, OS and the corresponding two-
sided 95% CI were presented along with the estimates for the 25th and 75th percentiles in all patients. 
The KM approach was used to estimate the distribution of DOR, PFS, EFS, and OS in all patients. 
Results 
A total of 85 patients were actually enrolled; however, due to a data transfer error from IXRS to RAVE, 
data for 1 patient was not captured. As this patient did not receive any study medication, only the intent-
to-treat (ITT) analysis population was affected and data were captured for 84 patients. 
There  were  3  patients  in  the  R-CHP  treatment  regimen  non-DLBCL  group,  51  patients  in  the  R-CHP 
treatment  regimen DLBCL  group,  5  patients  in  the G-CHP  treatment  regimen  non-DLBCL  group,  and 25 
patients in the G-CHP treatment regimen DLBCL group. 
Only data of patients with DLCBL in the R-CHP treatment regimen are described below: 
A total of 50 patients in the R-CHP treatment regimen, DLBCL, were included in the efficacy analysis.  
Study population was predominately White (43 [86.0%]) and female (26 [52.0%]), with a median age of 
68.5 years (range: 45-80 years). The majority of patients (37 [74.0%]) were ≥65 years old. A total of 12 
(24.0%) patients had an ECOG score of 0 at baseline, 23 (46.0%) patients had a baseline score of 1, and 
15 patients (30.0%) had a baseline score of 2. A total of 14 patients (28.0%) had an IPI score of 0-2 and 
36 patients (72.0%) had an IPI score of 3-5.

Pola dose cohorts were as follows: 2 patients, 1 mg/kg; 3 patients, 1.4 mg/kg; 5 patients, 1.8 mg/kg during 
dose-escalation phase and 40 patients, 1.8 mg/kg during dose-expansion phase. 
At the last patient last visit, patients were on the study over a median period of 35.12 months (range 1.28 
to 59.40 months).  
8 were discontinued from the study. All these patients were from 1.8 mg/kg-dose expansion group (4 due 
to deaths and 4 due to diseases progressions).  
The efficacy results are summarized below: 
• 
The CR rate for all doses at the end of treatment window visit by CT/MRI with PET scan was 78.0% 
(39/50; 90% CI: 66.22, 87.14). In the 45 patients treated with 1.8 mg/kg pola, the CR rate was 
100% (5/5; 90% CI: 54.93, 100.00) during the dose escalation phase and 75% (30/40; 90% CI: 
61.29, 85.76) during the dose expansion phase

Methodology: 
The individual empirical Bayes estimates of pola PK parameters estimated by the population PK model were 
used to obtain the individual pola exposure measures, defined as Cycle 6 AUC and Cmax for acMMAE and 
unconjugated MMAE based on nominal dose (i.e., assuming that the subject received the planned 1.8 mg/kg 
Q3W doses during the entire study). Only AUC for acMMAE was used for the exposure-efficacy analysis. 
Results: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Cox analysis suggested a significant correlation (p=0.01 by Cox regression) between acMMAE 
AUC and PFS, with higher exposure leading to a longer PFS. The forward inclusion identified baseline 
bulky  disease  and  B  cell  count  as  significant  covariates  at  α=0.01  level.  The  exposure-response 
relationship  remained  significant  in  the  presence  of  those  covariates  in  the  model.  Only  bulky 
disease remained in the final model at α=0.001 level during the backward elimination. 
The Cox analysis suggested a significant correlation (p=0.01 by Cox regression) between acMMAE 
AUC and EFSeff, with higher exposure leading to a longer EFSeff. The forward inclusion identified 
baseline  bulky  disease  as  a  significant  covariate  at  α=0.01  level.  The  exposure-response 
relationship remained significant in the presence of this covariate in the model. Only bulky disease 
remained in the final model at α=0.001 level during the backward elimination. 
The Cox analysis suggested no significant correlation between acMMAE AUC and interim OS. 
Probability of CR at the end of treatment did not correlate with acMMAE exposure (AUC).

Treatments 
Patients received six cycles of either pola+R-CHP or standard R-CHOP chemotherapy at 21-day intervals. 
Both arms then received two additional cycles of single agent rituximab. The study design and treatment 
regimens are respectively shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.  
Arm A; pola+R-CHP (investigational arm): pola 1.8 mg/kg IV, placebo for vincristine IV, rituximab 375 
mg/m2  IV,  cyclophosphamide  750  mg/m2  IV,  and  doxorubicin  50  mg/m2  IV  each  given  on  Day  1  and 
prednisone 100 mg/day orally (PO) given on Days 1-5 of every 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Rituximab 375 
mg/m2 IV was given as monotherapy in Cycles 7 and 8. 
Arm B; R-CHOP (control arm): placebo for pola, rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 
IV, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV, and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV (maximum 2 mg/dose) each given on Day 1 
and prednisone 100 mg/day PO given on Days 1-5 of every 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Rituximab 375 mg/m2 
IV was given as monotherapy in Cycles 7 and 8.

Administration schedule 
In Cycles 1-6, rituximab infusion was to be completed prior to starting any other agent administered by 
infusion.  The  order  of  administration  for  Cycles  1-6  were:  first  prednisone,  second  rituximab,  and  third 
blinded  polatuzumab  vedotin/placebo.  Subsequent 
infusions  of  blinded  vincristine/placebo, 
cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin were to be administered according to institutional preference. Cycle 7 
and Cycle 8 consisted of rituximab as monotherapy. 
The infusion of rituximab may be split over 2 days if the patient is at increased risk for an IRR (high tumor 
burden or high peripheral lymphocyte count). 
Blinded pola/placebo could be administered on Day 2 per investigator preference due to infusion times for 
rituximab and blinded pola/placebo. In this instance, blinded vincristine/placebo, cyclophosphamide, and 
doxorubicin  could  also  be  administered  on  Day  1  following  the  completion  of  rituximab,  and  blinded 
pola/placebo  could  be  administered  on  Day  2  after  prednisone.  Alternative  study  drug  administration 
regimens could be considered with consultation of the Medical Monitor. 
Should infusion-related reactions or other adverse events occur (e.g., during rituximab infusion), treatment 
could be administered over more than 1 day. 
Pre-Phase Steroids 
Steroids prior to study treatment initiation were allowed according to guidelines described in Protocol. The 
pre-phase treatment was not considered part of study treatment. The purpose of the pre-phase treatment 
is to prevent tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in patients with extensive disease and to reduce toxicity of the 
first cycle of study treatment (e.g., cytokine release syndrome). Staging study assessments (i.e., CT/MRI, 
PET-CT scan, tumor biopsy) were performed prior to initiation of pre-phase treatment.

For Cycles 1-6, pola or its placebo were administered after the prednisone and rituximab components of R-
CHP/R-CHOP were administered, as infusion reactions due to rituximab are typically more common than 
those for pola. The initial dose was administered to patients who are well hydrated over 90 (± 10) minutes. 
As  required,  premedication  (e.g.,  500-1000  mg  of  oral  acetaminophen  or  paracetamol  and  50-100  mg 
diphenhydramine as per institutional standard practice) was administered to an individual patient before 
administration  of  pola  /placebo,  unless  already  been  administered  as  a  premedication  for  rituximab).  If 
infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs)  were  observed  with  the  first  infusion  of  pola  in  the  absence  of 
premedication, premedication must be administered before subsequent doses as described in Table 3. 
Table 3: Premedication for Rituximab and Blinded Polatuzumab Vedotin/Placebo 
The pola/placebo infusion could be slowed or interrupted for patients who experienced infusion-associated 
symptoms.  Following  the  initial  dose,  patients  were  observed  for  90  minutes  for  fever,  chills,  rigors, 
hypotension,  nausea,  or  other  infusion-associated  symptoms.  If  prior  infusions  were  well  tolerated, 
subsequent  doses  of  pola  could  be  administered  over  30  (±  10)  minutes,  followed  by  a  30-minute 
observation period after the infusion. 
Dose modifications 
The  dose  of  blinded  polatuzumab  vedotin/placebo  and  blinded  vincristine/placebo  and  chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin) can be reduced stepwise to a maximum of two levels for management 
of drug-related toxicities. If further dose reduction is indicated after two dose reductions, the patient must 
discontinue  the  specific  study  drug  but  may  continue  treatment  with  the  remaining  study  drugs  at  the 
investigator’s discretion in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

If administration of R-CHP or R-CHOP is delayed, the administration of polatuzumab vedotin and R-CHP/R-
CHOP should be delayed for the same time frame; that is, all study drugs should be delayed for the same 
time frame so that they are all given together beginning on Day 1 of the same cycle. 
Guidelines  on  dose  delays  and  dose  modifications  for  R-CHP,  blinded  pola/placebo,  and  blinded 
vincristine/placebo are described in the tables below. No dose modifications of rituximab were allowed.

Assessment for disease response 
The primary study endpoint was PFS as assessed by the investigator. Patients were assessed for disease 
response  by  the  investigator  using  regular  clinical  and  laboratory  examinations  and  fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron  emission  tomography  (FDG-PET;  hereafter  referred  to  as  PET-CT)  and  dedicated  computed 
tomography (CT) scans (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan were performed if CT scans with contrast 
were contraindicated in the patient), according to the Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 
PET-CT  and  dedicated  CT  scans  were  obtained  at  screening  and  6-8  weeks  after  completion  of  study 
treatment. An interim assessment was obtained after Cycle 4 and including PET-CT and dedicated CT. If 
local practice prohibited obtaining both assessments after Cycle 4, PET-CT alone (preferred) or CT alone 
was  obtained  at  this  timepoint.  During  the  follow-up  period,  CT  scans  (PET-CT  also  acceptable)  were 
performed  every  6  months  (i.e.,  Months  6,  12,  18,  and  24)  until  the  end  of  Year  2  of  follow-up 
(approximately 2.5 years after the first dose) in accordance with study (clinic) visits and included the neck 
(if involved at baseline), chest, abdomen, and pelvis. During Years 3, 4, and 5 of follow-up, CT scans (PET-
CT acceptable) of sites of prior involvement were obtained every 12 months (at Months 36, 48, and 60). If 
disease  in  other  areas  were  suspected,  additional  areas  were  imaged  at  all  subsequent  imaging 
assessments. 
Response was evaluated at the end of study treatment, or sooner in the event a patient discontinued early. 
After completion of therapy, all patients were followed at clinic visits conducted every 3 months for 2 years, 
and then every 6 months until Month 60. At each visit up to the Year 5, Month 60 assessment (or until 
disease progression if it occurs before 5 years), assessments included but were not exhaustive to: physical 
examination,  standard  hematologic  and  biochemistry  assessments,  vital  signs,  and  B-symptoms  (i.e., 
weight loss, night sweats, or fever). 
After 5 years, patients were followed only for survival and initiation of a new antilymphoma therapy (NALT) 
by telephone contact approximately every 6 months until study termination, patient withdrawal of consent 
or death. After disease progression, patients were followed by telephone contact for survival, applicable 
adverse event reporting, and initiation of a NALT. 
While the primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, tumor assessments were collected by 
an  Independent  Review  Facility  (IRF)  for  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  PET-CT  CR  rate  at  the  end  of 
treatment by the Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 
Health status of patients 
Information  on  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  and  symptoms  from  self-reported  questionnaires 
provided  critical  feedback  about  patients’  well-being  which  were  used  to  better  understand  the  patient 
experience  of  treatment.  These  Patient-reported  outcomes  (PROs),  important  disease  and  treatment-
related symptoms, as well as functioning, were assessed with the FACTLym LymS and EORTC QLQ-C30. In 
addition, peripheral neuropathy was assessed using the FACT/GOG-NTX, as it is a treatment-related effect 
common  to  both  pola  and  vincristine.  The  FACT/GOG-NTX  evaluated  treatment-induced  neurologic 
symptoms (including sensory, hearing, motor, and dysfunction) and consisted of 11 questions. The EQ-5D-
5L was administered for the purpose of producing health utility scores for economic modeling. 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) 
An iDMC has been used to monitor patient safety and efficacy. Since protocol version 5, the rationale for 
iDMC was updated to reflect monitoring of only safety, no longer including efficacy.

Sample size 
Sample Size of PFS in the Global Study 
The planned enrolment for the global study was approximately 875 patients. Sample size considerations 
were based on the following assumptions: 
•  1:1 randomization ratio in R-CHP + polatuzumab vedotin versus R-CHOP 
• 
Planned enrolment for the global study was expected to complete in approximately 23 months 
•  A one-sided log-rank test 
•  80% power at the 2.5% significance level 
•  A 31% reduction in the risk of disease progression, relapse, or death, i.e., the PFS hazard ratio of 
R-CHP + polatuzumab vedotin over R-CHOP is 0.69. 
• 
PFS in the control arm follows a piece-wise exponential distribution, with the piece-wise hazard rate 
estimated using historical R-CHOP data 
On the basis of this hazard rate assumption for the control arm and a hazard ratio of 0.69, the 3-year PFS 
rate was expected to improve from 62% (which was observed in the GOYA study among patients with IPI 
2-5 who received R-CHOP) to 72%. 
•  An annual dropout rate of 5% assumed for both treatment arms 
Based on these assumptions, approximately 228 investigator-assessed PFS events were needed to detect 
a hazard ratio of 0.69 in PFS (3-year PFS rate of 62% to 72%), with 80% power for the primary analysis 
of PFS. The minimal detectable difference (MDD) for the PFS hazard ratio at the primary PFS analysis was 
0.771  (i.e.,  22.9%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  disease progression,  relapse,  or  death).  The  3-year  PFS  was 
expected to improve from 62% to 70% under the MDD.  
Sample Size of OS in the Global Study 
Considerations  of  sample  size  for  OS  was  also  based  on  patients  enrolled  in  the  global  study.  A  formal 
interim OS analysis was to be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis only if the PFS efficacy 
boundary  was  crossed  and  the  other  secondary  endpoints  higher  in  the  hierarchical  order  than  OS  had 
passed the corresponding significance levels. The sample size considerations were based on the following 
assumptions: 
•  1:1 randomization ratio in R-CHP + polatuzumab vedotin versus R-CHOP 
•  A one-sided log-rank test 
•  A 27% reduction in the risk of death, i.e., the OS hazard ratio of R-CHP + polatuzumab vedotin 
over R-CHOP is 0.73 
•  OS in the control arm follows an exponential distribution with a hazard rate of 0.006923 
•  An annual dropout rate of 1.5% assumed for both treatment arms 
Based on these assumptions, approximately 134 and 178 OS events was to be observed at the interim and 
the final OS analysis, respectively. The power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.73 in OS at the final analysis 
was 52%, and the corresponding MDD for the OS hazard ratio was 0.74.

After the global enrolment closes, additional Chinese patients are to be recruited into the China extension 
cohort for the purposes of registration in China. A total of approximately 150 Chinese patients are to be 
enrolled into the global study population and the China extension cohort combined.  
Interim analysis 
There were no planned interim analyses for PFS. 
A formal OS interim analysis was to be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis only if the PFS 
efficacy boundary was crossed and the other secondary endpoints higher in the hierarchical order than OS 
had passed the corresponding significance levels. OS was to be evaluated on the basis of the Haybittle-
Peto boundary (Haybittle 1971) for statistical significance, with the alpha boundary at the interim specified 
as 0.001. 
Randomisation 
Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either R-CHP + polatuzumab vedotin or R-CHOP. Both 
patients and the investigator will be blinded to the assigned active microtubule inhibitor (i.e., polatuzumab 
vedotin or vincristine) and placebo control. 
During randomisation, permuted blocks will be employed using the following stratification factors: 
• 
IPI score (IPI 2 versus IPI 3-5) 
•  Bulky disease, defined as one lesion ≥ 7.5 cm (present versus absent) 
•  Geographical region (Western Europe, United States, Canada, and Australia versus Asia versus Rest 
of World [remaining countries]) 
Blinding (masking) 
This is a double-blind study.  
Study site personnel (with the exception of unblinded pharmacists) and patients will be blinded to treatment 
assignment during the study. The Sponsor and its agents will also be blinded to treatment assignment, with 
the exception of individuals who require access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their job roles 
during a clinical trial. These roles include the unblinding group responsible, clinical supply chain managers, 
sample handling staff, operational assay group personnel, interactive voice or Web-based response system 
(IxRS) service provider, drug safety responsible, and iDMC members. 
Because  each  patient  will receive  either  polatuzumab  vedotin or  vincristine  and  the placebo  form of  the 
agent  the  patient  is  not  assigned  to,  the  IxRS  will  make  the  treatment  assignment.  The  unblinded 
pharmacist  will  provide  the  active  agent  and  the  placebo  agent  according  to  the  patient’s  treatment 
assignment. The investigator will remain blinded to the treatment assignment.  
While PK and anti-drug antibody (ADA) samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator 
arm  to  maintain  the  blinding  of  treatment  assignment,  PK  and  ADA  assay  results  for  these  patients  are 
generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this study. Laboratories responsible 
for  performing  study  drug  PK  and  ADA  assays  will  be  unblinded  to  patients'  treatment  assignments  to 
identify appropriate samples to be analyzed. PK samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm will 
not be analyzed for study drug PK concentration except by request (e.g., to evaluate a possible error in 
dosing). Baseline ADA samples will be analyzed for all patients. Post baseline ADA samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will not be analyzed for ADAs except by request.

EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 68/174 
 
 
 
 
 
If unblinding is necessary for immediate patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse event 
for which patient management might be affected by knowledge of treatment assignment), the investigator 
will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS. The investigator is not required to contact 
the  Medical  Monitor  prior  to  breaking  the  treatment  code;  however,  the  treatment  code  should  not  be 
broken except in medical emergency situations. 
If  the  investigator  wishes  to  know  the  identity  of  the  study  drug  for  any  reason  other  than  a  medical 
emergency, he or she should contact the Medical Monitor directly. The investigator should document and 
provide  an  explanation  for  any  non-emergency  unblinding.  The  investigator  will  be  able  to  break  the 
treatment code by contacting the IxRS. 
As  per  health  authority  and  applicable  legislation  reporting  requirements,  the  Sponsor  Drug  Safety 
representative will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions that 
are  considered  by  the  investigator or  Sponsor to  be  related  to  study  drug.  The  patient  may  continue  to 
receive treatment, and the investigator, patient, and Sponsor personnel, with the exception of the Drug 
Safety representative and personnel who must have access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their 
roles (as defined above), will remain blinded to treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The ITT population is defined as all patients randomised during the global enrolment phase (including 
patients enrolled in mainland China during that phase), i.e., the global study, whether or not the patients 
received the assigned treatment. The global study is defined as the 879 patients randomised into the study 
on  or  before  27  June  2019.    The  ITT  patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  treatment  assigned  at 
randomisation by the interactive voice/Web response system (IxRS). The ITT population was used for all 
efficacy analyses. 
The China extension cohort is defined as patients from mainland China who were randomised after 27 June 
2019.  Patients  randomised  during the  China  extension  phase  are  not be included  in  the ITT  population; 
they are not included in the analyses in this report from the Primary CSR. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
To  control  the  overall  type  I  error  rate  at  a  one-sided  0.025  level  of  significance,  a  hierarchical  testing 
procedure including possible α recycling was used to adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary 
and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The test hierarchy and α spending plan for key secondary efficacy 
endpoints are described in the Figure 4 below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 69/174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 19: Test hierarchy and alpha-spending plan for key secondary efficacy endpoints in POLARIX study 
A  formal  OS  interim  analysis  will  be  performed  at  the  time  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis  only  if  the  PFS 
efficacy boundary is crossed, and the other secondary endpoints higher in the hierarchical order than OS 
have passed the corresponding significance levels. 
Given the low likelihood of OS crossing the boundary at the interim OS analysis, a Haybittle-Peto boundary 
(Haybittle 1971) is chosen with 0.001 at the interim as the nominal alpha value to control the type I error 
in the group sequential analysis of OS. 
The remaining secondary endpoints were tested without adjusting for multiplicity. 
Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS, as determined by the investigator, defined as the time from the date 
of randomisation until the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse as assessed by the investigator 
using  the  2014  Lugano  Classification  for  Malignant  Lymphoma  (Cheson  et  al.  2014),  or  death  from  any 
cause, whichever occurs first. For patients who have not progressed, relapsed, or died as of the clinical 
cutoff date for analysis, PFS is censored on the date of last disease assessment when the patient is known 
to be progression free. If no tumor assessments are performed after the baseline visit or all post-baseline 
tumor  assessment  results  have  overall  responses  of  “not  evaluable,”  PFS  is  censored  on  the  date  of 
randomisation. Censoring rules for PFS are also summarized in the Table 8 below.

Table 8: Censoring rules for PFS in the primary analysis (POLARIX study) 
Treatment comparison were made using a one-sided level 0.025 stratified log-rank test. 
The randomisation stratification factors to be used in the efficacy analyses were IPI score, bulky disease, 
and geographical region. They were obtained from the IxRS at the time of randomisation. 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the PFS distribution for each treatment arm and to 
construct curves for the visual description of the difference between the treatment arms. Estimates of the 
Assessment report

treatment  effect  were  expressed  as  hazard  ratios  using  a  stratified  Cox  proportional-hazards  analysis, 
including 95% confidence intervals. Median PFS was not expected to be reached in this study at the time 
of the primary PFS analysis clinical cutoff; hence, the 1-year and 2-year rates were used to describe PFS 
in addition to the hazard ratio. Results from an unstratified analysis were also provided. 
Key secondary analyses 
Event-Free Survival - Efficacy Causes 
EFSeff is used to reflect EFS events that are primarily due to efficacy and will be defined as time from date 
of randomization to the earliest occurrence of any of the below listed events: 
1. Disease progression/relapse 
2. Death due to any cause 
3. The primary efficacy reason determined by the investigator, other than disease progression/relapse, that 
leads to initiation of any non-protocol specified anti-lymphoma treatment (NALT) 
4. If biopsy is obtained after treatment completion and is positive for residual disease regardless of whether 
NALT is initiated or not  
For the third case above, the efficacy reason includes instances where a PET-CT scan, bone marrow test, 
CT/MRI, or physical finding is suggestive of residual disease; or instances where a biopsy confirms residual 
disease. EFSeff event timing is at the time of the test or biopsy leading to NALT, rather than the date of 
NALT initiation. 
For patients without the occurrence of any above cases (no EFSeff event) at the time of analysis, EFSeff was 
censored on the date of last tumour assessment when the patient was known to be progression-free. For 
patients  who  did  not  have  post-baseline  tumour  assessments  or  all  post-baseline  tumour  assessment 
results  have  overall  responses  of  ‘not  evaluable’,  EFSeff  was  censored  on  the  date  of  randomization. 
Censoring rules for EFSeff are also summarized in the Table 9 below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 72/174 
 
 
 
 
Table 9: Censoring rules for EFS eff (POLARIX study) 
Treatment comparisons for EFSeff were performed using the stratified log-rank test. KM methodology was 
used  to  estimate  the  EFSeff  distribution  for  each  treatment  arm  and  construct  curves  for  the  visual 
description of the difference between the treatment arms. Estimates of the treatment effect were expressed 
as hazard ratios using a stratified Cox proportional-hazards analysis, including 95% confidence intervals. 
CR rate at end of treatment by PET-CT 
CR  rate  at  end  of  treatment  by  PET-CT  by  BICR  or  by  the  investigator  is  defined  as  the  percentage  of 
patients with CR at the end of treatment by PET-CT as determined by BICR or by investigator. Patients not 
meeting  these  criteria,  including  patients  without  the  end-of-treatment  tumor  assessments  or  if  their 
response at end of treatment is not evaluable, were considered non-CR patients. 
An estimate of CR rate and its 95% CI were calculated with the Clopper-Pearson method for each treatment 
arm. The 95% CIs for the difference in CR rate between the two treatment arms was computed using the 
Wilson  method  (Wilson  1927).  The  CR  rate  was  compared  between  the  two  arms  using  the  CMH  test 
stratified by the same factors used in the PFS primary analysis. 
Overall Survival 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 73/174 
 
 
 
 
  
OS is defined as the period from the date of randomization until the date of  death from any cause. For 
patients who have not died at the clinical cutoff date for analysis, OS was censored on the last date when 
the  patients  were  known  to  be  alive,  as  documented  by  investigator.  Patients  who  did  not  have  post-
baseline information were censored at the date of randomization. The duration of OS was analysed with 
the same methodologies as EFSeff.  
Sensitivity analyses 
The  ITT  population  was  the  primary  population  for  all  efficacy  measures  and  was  the  only  population 
examined for all sensitivity analyses. 
1. Impact of missing scheduled tumour assessments on PFS 
The  impact  of  missing  scheduled  tumour  assessments  on  PFS  was  assessed  by  performing  a  sensitivity 
analysis based on the interval censoring analysis methods. The PFS survival curves were estimated using 
the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimate (NPMLE) (Turnbull 1974) for each treatment arm. One-
year and 2-year rates of each treatment arm will be reported and their 95% confidence intervals will be 
constructed based on the Greenwood method. 
For descriptive purpose, hypothesis testing will be performed based on the log-rank test proposed by Sun 
(Sun 1996) to compare the PFS between the treatment arms. The treatment effect will be estimated using 
a  stratified  proportional  hazard  regression  model  (Finkelstein  1986)  with  a  parametric  assumption  of 
piecewise  exponential  distribution  for  the  baseline  hazard  function  (Friedman  et  al.  1982;  Royston  and 
Parmar 2002). 
2. Impact of NALT prior to or in the absence of Progression on PFS 
The impact of NALT prior to PD due to efficacy reason was assessed by discount method to investigate how 
the PFS results would have looked if the NALT was not available. More specifically, the time interval during 
which patients received NALT until the event or censoring time was discounted at 10%, 30%, and 50% for 
both arms. Note that the primary analysis of PFS corresponds to a discount analysis with a discount rate of 
0% on PFS time after NALT. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the overall impact of NALT. For patients who 
have  taken  NALT  prior  to  or  in  the  absence  of  subsequent  death  or  disease  progression,  their  PFS  was 
censored at the time of their last adequate tumour assessment before the first NALT. 
3. Restricted Mean Survival Time Analysis on PFS and OS 
The restricted mean survival time (RMST) (Royston and Parmar, 2011) method will be used as an additional 
sensitivity analysis to measure the difference in the average event-free survival time between treatment 
and control arm from the randomization through a pre-specified time point. Specifically, unstratified non-
parametric KM estimate of RMST by arm as well as the difference of RMST between arms will be evaluated. 
The  95%  confidence  intervals  (by  Greenwood  method)  and  p-values  (by  Z  test)  will  be  provided  for 
descriptive purpose. The RMST of PFS and OS will be estimated at month 12, 24, and 36. 
Subgroup analyses 
To assess the consistency of the study results in subgroups defined by demographics (e.g., age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity), baseline prognostic characteristics (including but not limited to ECOG performance status, 
cell of origin determined by gene expression profiling, IPI, aaIPI, co-expression of BCL2 and MYC by immune 
histochemistry  (IHC)  [double-expressor  lymphoma],  and  MYC  and  BCL2  and/or  BCL6  translocations  by 
FISH [high-grade B-cell lymphoma]), the duration of PFS in these subgroups was examined.

The study first patient enrolled was on 15 November 2017 and the data cut-off was on 28 June 2021. 
There were 6 amendments to the study protocol. Protocol versions 5 and 6 included some changes to the 
planned analyses, as described below. 
Table 10: Changes to planned analyses in protocol amendments 
Protocol version 
Changes to planned analyses 
Version 5 
Sample size and analysis plan of the Asia subpopulation analysis adjusted. 
3 December 2019 
The planned futility analysis was removed. Given the timing of when the 
futility analysis was planned to occur, all patients would have been enrolled 
and completed study treatment in POLARIX.  
The rationale for iDMC was updated to reflect monitoring of only safety, no 
longer including efficacy. 
Version 6 
Main changes involved updates to the timing of the primary analysis, the 
23 October 2020 
secondary efficacy analysis and the overall survival interim and final 
analyses 
The hierarchical testing procedure, including possible α recycling that will be 
used to adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, was updated. 
The timing of the primary analysis was updated to occur when there are 
approximately 228 PFS events, and after all patients in the global study 
have been enrolled for at least 24 months, whichever comes later (vs when 
there are 236 PFS events in previous versions). The number of PFS events 
is selected to achieve statistical power of 80% for the target hazard ratio at 
the primary analysis and 24 months follow up, given that in patients with 
previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), most disease 
relapse occurs within this time frame. 
Other changes involve updates to the secondary efficacy analysis and the 
overall survival interim and final analyses. 
The timing of the Asian subpopulation analysis is clarified to occur no earlier 
than the primary analysis of the global cohort. 
The first version of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was finalised on 18 June 2020, with two subsequent 
revisions on 9 September 2020 (version 2) and 12 October 2020 (version 3). All three SAP version were 
therefore finalised while the study was ongoing but prior to data cut-off. 
Updates to the SAP include: 
-  Censoring tables have been edited to clarify the efficacy analysis of PFS and event-free survival for 
efficacy causes (EFSeff).  
- 
- 
EFSall will be analyzed using the same methods as PFS because both endpoints will be evaluated in 
the ITT population. 
For time-to-event endpoints where the median survival time will not expect to be reached, 1-year 
and 2-year rates will be reported.

have at least one serum ADA assessment. 
Results 
Participant flow 
As of the CCOD (clinical cutoff date, 28-Jun-2021), 764 patients (86.9%) had completed treatment. A total 
of 737 patients (83.8%) were still on study, and 142 patients (16.2%) had discontinued the study. The 
most frequent reason for patients discontinuing the study was due to death (12.3%). 
At the time of CCOD, 109 patients (12.4%) had discontinued from treatment (i.e. prior to completing all 
planned treatment cycles); 60 patients (13.7%) in the R-CHOP arm and 49 patients (11.1%) in the pola+R-
CHP arm (Table 11):

Table 11: Summary of Study Drug Discontinuation (safety evaluable population) 
Compliance with Treatment and Treatment Delays 
A high proportion of patients (91.7% [399 patients] receiving pola as part of the pola+RCHP regimen and 
88.5% [386 patients] receiving vincristine as part of the R-CHOP regimen) completed the planned 6 cycles 
of study treatment. The median number of cycles of pola or vincristine received was 6.0 and the median 
relative dose intensity was 99.8% for pola and 100.0% for vincristine. The median treatment duration for 
both pola and vincristine was as expected (3.5 months). 
Overall, no differences between treatment arms were observed in regards to CHP treatment. The median 
duration  of  exposure  to  CHP  (cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  and  prednisone)  was  balanced  between 
treatment arms. Approximately 90% of patients in each treatment arm received 6 cycles of CHP treatment, 
corresponding to a median of 3.5 to 3.6 months of treatment

A total of 10.1% (44 patients) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 8.4% (37 patients) in the R-CHOP arm had a 
treatment delay of >7 days in at least one treatment cycle. The percentage of patients who had more than 
1 treatment cycle delayed by >7 days was the same in each arm (0.9% [4 patients]). 
Recruitment 
Of  the  1063  patients  screened,  879  patients  were  randomized  into  the  study  and  184  patients  failed 
screening based on information collected in the IxRS. The first patient was randomized on 15 November 
2017. The last patient was randomized on 27 June 2019. 
The main reasons for screen failure were patients not meeting the following inclusion criteria: IPI score of 
2-5  (29  patients),  availability  of  archival  or  freshly  collected  tumor  tissue  before  study  enrollment  (28 
patients) and provision of signed written ICF (21 patients). 
A  total  of  879  patients  were  enrolled  at  211  sites  in  22  countries,  in  3  regions.  The  top  recruiting 
geographical region in descending order were: 
•  Western  Europe/US/Canada/Australia  (603  patients  [Australia,  Austria,  Belgium,  Canada, 
Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Italy, US]). 
•  Asia (160 patients [China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan]). 
•  Rest of the World (116 patients [Brazil, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Russian Federation, 
Turkey, Ukraine]).

Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were reported under the following four categories: inclusion criteria, exclusion 
criteria,  procedural  and  medication.  Protocol  deviations  of  interest  were  chosen  on  the  basis  of  being 
considered  likely  to  have  had  a  direct  impact  on  data  important  for  interpretation  of  the  study  results 
(including efficacy and patient safety). 
Overall,  50/879  patients  (5.7%)  had  at  least  one  protocol  deviation  of  interest.  The  most  frequently 
reported major protocol deviations of interest were: exclusion criteria not met (1.9%), followed by non-
compliance  with  study  drug  treatment  modification  (tx  mod)  or  stoppage  rules  (either  temporary  or 
permanent)  (0.9%),  accidental  unblinding  of  a  subject  or  subjects  (0.8%),  and  incorrect  subject  kit 
given/administered (0.7%).

By gene expression profiling, 25.1% of patients had ABC like DLBCL, 40.0% of patients had GCB like 
DLBCL, 10.8% were unclassified and 24.0% were unknown. 
Prior Disease 
All patients (100%) in the ITT population had at least one medical history condition (pola+R-CHP and R-
CHOP  arms).  The  most  common  medical  history  by  SOC  (≥30%  in  either  arm)  were:  Metabolism  and 
nutrition  disorders  (47.6%  pola+R-CHP  vs  51.1%  R-CHOP  ),  Vascular  disorders  (48.5%  vs  48.9), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (47.4% vs 45.7%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (37.9% vs 
35.4%).  Patient  medical  history  reported  in  the  ITT  population  was  reflective  of  the  expected  medical 
comorbidities  of  this  patient  population,  primarily  associated  with  median  age  65-66  years,  and  were 
generally well balanced between the arms with regard to system organ class (SOC) and individual medical 
history conditions.

Prior and concomitant therapy 
Concomitant medication was defined as any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, 
vaccines,  herbal  or  homeopathic  remedies,  nutritional  supplements)  used  by  a  patient  in  addition  to 
protocol-mandated  treatment 
from  7  days  prior  to 
initiation  of  study  drug  to  the  study 
completion/discontinuation visit. 
All patients (100%) in the ITT population received at least one concomitant medication (pola+R-CHP and 
R-CHOP arms). 
The  most  frequently  used  types  of  concomitant  medication  (ATC  level  1,  ≥90%  in  either  arm)  were: 
Alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (97.5%  pola+R-CHP  vs  97.5%  R-CHOP),  Dermatologicals  (95.4%  vs 
95.9%),  Antineoplastic  and  immunomodulating  agents  (94.0%  vs  96.1%),  Nervous  system  (93.1%  vs 
93.4%), Respiratory system (91.0% vs 92.5%). 
The majority of patients in the ITT population received at least one prior concomitant medication (84.1%, 
pola+R-CHP vs 86.5% R-CHOP).  
Pre-phase  steroid  treatment  was  received  by  37.7%  of  patients  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  38.6%  of 
patients in the R-CHOP arm within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). 
Concomitant GCSF was received by 92.9% of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 95.2% of patients in the 
R-CHOP arm. Concomitant GCSF for prophylaxis use was received by 90.1% of patients in the pola+R-CHP 
arm and 93.2% of patients in the R-CHOP arm. 
Concomitant  medication  for  anti-infective  prophylaxis  use  were  received  by  61.6%  of  patients  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm and 57.1% of patients in the R-CHOP arm.  
Concomitant medication related to AEs were received by 91.5% of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 
87.2% of patients in the R-CHOP arm.

Table 17: Censoring Rules for Primary Analysis of Investigator-Assessed PFS: Patient Count (ITT 
Population) 
1. Impact of missing scheduled tumour assessments on PFS 
The  impact  of  missing  scheduled tumor  assessments  on  PFS,  and  the  fact  that  the  actual  timing of  PFS 
events  usually  cannot  be  observed  exactly  was  assessed  by  performing  a  sensitivity  analysis  based  on 
interval censoring analysis method. The result of the analysis was consistent with the result of the primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 88/174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PFS analysis, and showed a higher reduction in the risk of PFS events for patients treated with pola+R-CHP 
compared  with  patients  treated  with  R-CHOP.  Stratified  HR  was  0.75  (95%  CI:  0.58,  0.96)  in  favor  of 
pola+R-CHP treatment. 
2. Impact of NALT prior to or in the absence of Progression on PFS 
The impact of initiation of NALT prior to or in the absence of subsequent death or disease progression was 
assessed by performing sensitivity analyses by discount method, and by censoring PFS at the last adequate 
tumor assessment before the initiation of NALT. Results from these analyses were consistent with the result 
of analysis of the primary endpoint indicating that there was minimal impact of NALT prior to PD on the 
PFS results. 
Stratified HRs for PFS, after discounting time after the initiation of NALT by 10%, 30%, and 50% for both 
arms, were: 
– 10% discount: 0.73 (95%CI: 0.57, 0.95) favoring pola+R-CHP treatment 
– 30% discount: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.95) favoring pola+R-CHP treatment 
– 50% discount: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.94) favoring pola+R-CHP treatment 
Stratified HR for PFS censored at the last adequate tumor assessment before the initiation of NALT was 
0.77 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.01) favoring pola+R-CHP treatment. 
3. Restricted Mean Survival Time Analysis on PFS and OS 
The  difference  in  the  average  event-free  survival  time  between  treatment  and  control  arm  from 
randomization to 12, 24 and 36 months after randomization was assessed using restricted mean survival 
time  (RMST)  method  to  provide  an  alternative  measure  of  treatment  effect  to  the  hazard  ratio.  RMST 
estimates suggested that patients treated with pola+R-CHP had longer mean PFS duration than patients 
treated with R-CHOP. 
Mean survival time at various milestones (pola+R-CHP vs. R-CHOP) were: 
•  12 months: 11.1 months vs. 10.9 months (treatment difference= 0.2 [95% CI: -0.1, 0.5] favoring 
pola+R-CHP treatment) 
•  24 months: 20.6 months vs. 19.6 months (treatment difference= 1.0 [95% CI: 0.1, 2.0] favoring 
pola+R-CHP treatment) 
•  36 months: 28.4 months vs. 27.4 months (treatment difference= 1.0 [95% CI: -1.2, 3.1] favoring 
pola+R-CHP treatment. Please note that, since the median PFS follow-up was 24.7 months in both 
arms, the 36 month RMST estimates were not mature and is subject to change with longer follow-
up. 
Subgroup Analyses of Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival 
There  was  a  directionally  consistent  treatment  effect  supporting  the  PFS  benefit  of  pola+R-CHP  in  the 
majority of subgroups (HR <1), and all 95% CIs for HR in the major subgroups (with sample size > 100) 
include 0.73, i.e., the estimated stratified HR in the ITT population.

Given the known limitations of exploratory subgroup analyses (Wang et al, 2007; Alosh et al, 2016), results 
should not be over interpreted and there is no statistical evidence for heterogeneity of treatment effect in 
any of the subgroups.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Investigator-Assessed Event-Free Survival for Efficacy Reasons 
EFSeff  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  earliest  occurrence  of  disease 
progression/relapse, death, biopsy that is positive for residual disease after treatment completion, or start 
of a NALT due to efficacy reasons. A higher proportion of patients in the R-CHOP arm received NALT (30.3%) 
compared to pola+R-CHP arm (22.5%).

At the time of the CCOD, 112 patients (25.5%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 138 patients (31.4%) in the 
R-CHOP arm had an EFS event. Results of the secondary endpoint EFSeff, were statistically significant and 
highly consistent with results of the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS and was supportive of 
the clinical benefit for pola+R-CHP compared with R-CHOP. A statistically significant reduction by 25% in 
the risk of an EFSeff event was observed in the pola+R-CHP arm compared with the R-CHOP arm (stratified 
HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.96], two-sided p-value = 0.0244, two-sided α=0.05; Table 18). Median EFSeff 
estimates were not considered mature for either treatment arm as of the CCOD.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: New anti-lymphoma treatment 
NALT  could  be  administered  after  the  patient  had  completed  study  treatment,  and  included  both 
radiotherapy or systemically administered therapies. NALT was allowed to be administered with or without 
a disease progression documented in the patient. Follow-up anti-lymphoma treatments is described in Table 
19.

In addition, 8 patients received pola as a NALT (either alone or in combination) in the R-CHOP arm, and no 
patients in the pola+R-CHP arm received pola as NALT.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: BICR-Assessed Complete Response Rate at End of Treatment (by 
PET-CT) 
At the end of the treatment, BICR-assessed CR rate was high in both arms. A numerically higher proportion 
of patients treated with pola+R-CHP had complete response at the end of treatment compared to patients 
treated with R-CHOP (78.0% [95% CI: 73.79, 81.74] vs. 74.0% [95% CI: 69.66, 78.07]; Table 20). The 
treatment difference was 3.9% (95% CI: -1.9, 9.7) and was not statistically significant (two-sided p-value 
= 0.1557, two-sided α boundary of 0.01).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival 
The  frequency  of  OS  events  (deaths)  were  low  in  both  arms  (Table  22).  A  total  of  53  deaths  (12.0% 
patients) were reported in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 57 deaths (13.0% patients) were reported in the R-
CHOP arm. With very few events in both arms, OS results were still immature at the time of the interim 
analysis of OS and did not meet the pre-specified threshold for statistical significance (stratified HR: 0.94 
[95%  CI:  0.65,  1.37];  two-sided  log-rank  p-value  =  0.7524,  two-sided  α  boundary=  0.002).  The 
unstratified analysis of OS showed results similar to the stratified analysis. A KM curve is shown in Figure 
7. Milestone OS results for the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm were 92.2% and 94.6% at 1 year, 
and 88.7% and 88.6% at 2 years, respectively.

Others Secondary Efficacy Endpoints relative to response rates assessment:  
Investigator-Assessed Complete Response Rate at End of Treatment (by PET-CT) 
Investigator-assessed CR rates were high, and comparable to BICR-assessed CR rates (Section 5.1.3.2) in 
both arms. At the end of treatment, 75.0% (95% CI: 70.68, 78.98) patients in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 
72.2%  (95%  CI:  67.76,  76.35)  patients  in the  R-CHOP  arm  had  complete  response  as  assessed  by  the 
Investigator (Table 21). The difference in CR rate between the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm was 
2.79 (95% CI: -3.20, 8.75). This analysis was not formally tested. 
Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate at End of Treatment 
At the end of treatment, a high proportion of patients achieved Investigator-assessed ORR (i.e. CR or PR) 
in  both  arms  (84.5%  [95%  CI:  80.82,  87.79]  vs.  80.9%  [95%  CI:  76.87,  84.44]),  with  patients  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm achieving a better response in terms of ORR compared to patients in the R-CHOP arm 
(treatment difference=3.68% [95% CI: -1.49, 8.84]). 
BICR-Assessed Objective Response Rate at End of Treatment 
Similar to the Investigator-assessed ORR (Section 5.1.3.5), a high proportion of patients achieved BICR-
assessed ORR (i.e. CR or PR) in both arms at the end of treatment (85.5% [95% CI: 81.81, 88.61] vs. 
83.8% [95% CI: 80.04, 87.15]). Treatment difference between the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm 
was 1.63% (95% CI: -3.32, 6.57). 
Investigator-Assessed Best Overall Response Rate 
Investigator-assessed BOR revealed high response rates (i.e. best response of CR or PR while on study) in 
both the pola+R-CHP arm (95.9% [95% CI: 93.61, 97.56]) and the R-CHOP arm (94.1% [95% CI: 91.44, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 96/174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
96.10]).  Best  CR  rate  as  of  the  CCOD  was  86.6%  (95%  CI:  83.05,  89.63)  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and 
82.7% (95% CI: 78.82, 86.11) in the R-CHOP arm. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response 
DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented clinical response (CR 
or PR) to the date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause for the subgroup of patients with a BOR 
of CR or PR, all assessed by the investigator. 
Of the patients who achieved a best overall response of CR or PR, 94 patients (22.3%) in the pola+R-CHP 
arm,  and  116  patients  (28.1%)  in  the  R-CHOP  arm  had  subsequent  disease  progression  or  death.  In 
patients who achieved CR or PR, treatment with pola+R-CHP reduced the risk of progression or death by 
26% compared to R-CHOP treatment (stratified HR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.98]). The favorability of the 
pola+R-CHP treatment compared to R-CHOP treatment in DOR suggests that even though response rates 
are high in both treatment arms, response was more durable in the pola+R-CHP arm. KM curves for DOR 
started to separate at approximately 5 months after the first response in favor of the pola+R-CHP arm, and 
remained separated for the duration of the study (section 5.1.3.8 of the CSR). Milestone DOR results for 
the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm were 83.8% and 78.2% at 1 year, and 75.7% and 71.7% at 2 
years, respectively, after first response. 
Investigator-Assessed Disease-Free Survival 
DFS was defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR to the date of relapse 
or death from any cause for the subgroup of patients with a BOR of CR, all assessed by the investigator. 
A lower proportion of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm progressed or died subsequent to achieving a CR, 
compared to patients in the R-CHOP arm (62 patients [16.3%] vs. 79 patients [21.8%]). In patients who 
achieved CR, treatment with pola+R-CHP reduced the risk of progression or death by 30% compared to 
treatment with R-CHOP (stratified HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.98]). The favorability of the 
Pola+R-CHP  arm  compared  to  the  R-CHOP  arm  in  DFS  suggests  that  even  though  CR  was  high  in  both 
treatment arms, remission status was more durable in the pola+R-CHP arm. 
KM curves began to separate at approximately 6 months after randomization in favor of pola+R-CHP, and 
the separation was maintained for the duration of follow-up (section 5.1.3.9 of the CSR). 
Milestone DFS results for the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm were 90.1% and 83.4% at 1 year, and 
81.8% and 77.4% at 2 years after first CR, respectively. 
Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival Rate at 24 Months After Randomization 
A  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  remained  alive  and  progression-free  24  months 
after randomization. The estimated 2-year investigator-assessed PFS was 76.7% in patients treated with 
pola+R-CHP compared to 70.2% in patients treated with R-CHOP (absolute difference of 6.5% [95% CI: 
0.52, 12.5]). This analysis was not formally tested. 
Investigator-Assessed Event-Free Survival-All Causes 
EFSall  differs  from  EFSeff,  and  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  to  disease  progression  or 
relapse,  as  determined  by  the  investigator,  death  from  any  cause,  or  initiation  of  any  NALT.  A  higher 
proportion of patients in the R-CHOP arm received NALT (30.3%) compared to pola+R-CHP arm (22.5%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 97/174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results for EFSall was consistent with the results for EFSeff. At the time of CCOD, 133 patients (30.2%) 
in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 165 patients (37.6%) in the R-CHOP arm had an EFSall event. The risk of an 
EFSall  event  was  reduced  by  27%  following  pola+R-CHP  treatment  compared  to  R-CHOP  treatment 
(stratified HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.92]). This analysis was not formally tested. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Completion rates of all questionnaires were high (≥95%) at baseline in both arms, and remained ≥80% at 
each subsequent timepoint. 
Responder analysis 
- Physical functioning 
Patients in both arms showed high levels of physical functioning at baseline (mean: 80.04 vs. 80.55) with 
scores improving over time. As of the CCOD, a higher proportion of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm (42.4% 
[95% CI: 37.56, 47.30]) experienced clinically meaningful improvement in physical functioning, i.e. ≥7-
point increase, as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale compared to the R-CHOP arm 
(39.6% [95% CI: 34.81, 44.47]). The difference in response rates between pola+R-CHP and 
R-CHOP treatments was 2.81 (95% CI: -4.06, 9.64). 
- Fatigue 
Patients in both arms reported fatigue at baseline (mean: 37.32 vs. 35.11). As of the CCOD, the proportion 
of  patients  experiencing  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  fatigue  (i.e.  ≥9-point  decrease,  as 
measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale) was higher in the pola+R-CHP arm compared to the R-CHOP 
arm (74.8% [95% CI: 70.34, 78.93] vs. 68.2% [63.47, 72.68], treatment difference= 6.61 [95% CI: 0.28, 
12.88]). 
- Lymphoma symptoms 
Patients in both arms reported lymphoma symptoms at baseline (mean: 44.7 vs. 45.3). 
As of the CCOD, the proportion of patients experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in lymphoma 
symptoms  (i.e.  a  ≥3-point  increase  per  FACT-Lym  LymS)  was  high  and  comparable  between  treatment 
arms  (82.3%  [95%  CI:  78.30,  85.88]  vs.  81.3%  [95%  CI:  77.20,  84.96],  treatment  difference  =  1.01 
(95% CI: -4.43, 6.45)). 
Time to Deterioration Analysis 
- Physical functioning 
A total of 183 patients (41.6%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 187 patients (42.6%) in the R-CHOP arm had 
a clinically meaningful deterioration (i.e. ≥10-point decrease) from baseline in physical functioning as of 
the CCOD. No difference in the risk of deterioration of physical functioning was observed between arms 
(stratified HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.79, 1.19]). The median time to clinically meaningful deterioration in physical 
functioning was not reached in the pola+R-CHP arm and was 25.5 months in the R-CHOP arm. Results of 
unstratified analysis was similar to the results of stratified analysis. Deterioration event-free rates in the 
pola+R-CHP  arm  and  the  R-CHOP  arm  were  57.0%,  and  56.6%,  respectively  at  1  year  and  54.9%  and 
53.3%, respectively at 2 years.

Patients in the R-CHOP arm experienced clinically meaningful deterioration in fatigue 
(i.e. ≥ 10-point increase in fatigue scale from baseline) earlier (median TTD: 3.0 months) than patients in 
the pola+R-CHP arm (6.7 months). As of the CCOD, a total of 223 patients (50.7%) in the pola+R-CHP 
arm,  and  230  patients  (52.4%)  in  the  R-CHOP  arm  had  a  clinically  meaningful  deterioration  in  fatigue 
scores (stratified HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.13]). Results of unstratified analysis was similar to the results 
of  stratified  analysis.  Deterioration  event-free  rates  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  the  R-CHOP  arm  were 
48.8%, and 44.1%, respectively at 1 year, and 45.2% and 41.8%, respectively at 2 years. 
- Lymphoma symptoms 
As of the CCOD, a total of 148 patients (33.6%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 138 patients (31.4%) in the 
R-CHOP arm had a clinically meaningful deterioration in lymphoma symptom (i.e. a ≥3-point decrease from 
baseline).  No  difference  in  the  risk  of  deterioration  of  lymphoma  scores  was  observed  between  arms 
(stratified HR: 1.03 [0.81, 1.30]). Results of unstratified analyses was similar to the results of stratified 
analysis. 
Medians were not reached in either arm. Deterioration event-free rates in the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-
CHOP arm were 66.4%, and 68.0%, respectively at 1 year, and 63.5% and 64.0%, respectively at 2 years. 
- Fever 
A total of 74 patients (16.8%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 73 patients (16.6%) in the R-CHOP arm had a 
clinically meaningful deterioration in fever score. No difference in the risk of deterioration of fever score 
was observed between arms (stratified HR: 0.94 [0.68, 1.30]). Results of unstratified analysis was similar 
to the results of stratified analysis. Medians were not achieved in either arm. Deterioration event-free rates 
in the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm were 84.1%, and 83.2%, respectively at 1 year, and 81.0% 
and 81.5%, respectively at 2 years. 
- Weight loss 
A total of 161 patients (36.6%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 161 patients (36.7%) in the R-CHOP arm had 
a clinically meaningful deterioration in weight loss score. No difference in the risk of deterioration of weight 
loss score was observed between arms (stratified HR: 0.97 [0.78, 1.20]). Results of unstratified analysis 
was  similar  to  the  results  of  stratified  analysis.  Medians  were  not  achieved  in  either  arm.  Deterioration 
event-free rates in the pola+R-CHP arm and the R-CHOP arm were 60.8%, and 63.1%, respectively at 1 
year, and 58.8% and 58.7%, respectively at 2 years. 
- Night sweats 
A total of 101 patients (23.0%) in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 119 patients (27.1%) in the R-CHOP arm had 
a clinically meaningful deterioration in night sweat score. Treatment with pola+R-CHP reduced the risk of 
deterioration of night sweat score by 22% compared to R-CHOP (stratified HR: 0.78 [0.60, 1.02]). Results 
of unstratified analysis was similar to the results of stratified analysis. Medians were not achieved in either 
arm,  however  KM  plots  separated  approximately  4  months  after  randomization  and  the  separation  was 
maintained  throughout  the  duration  of  follow-up.  Deterioration  event-free  rates  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm 
and the R-CHOP arm were 76.9%, and 74.2%, respectively at 1 year, and 74.8% and 68.9%, respectively 
at 2 years. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Treatment-Related Symptoms and Peripheral Neuropathy 
EORTC QLQ-C30 treatment-related symptom and the FACT/GOG-Ntx peripheral neuropathy scores between 
treatment arms were compared using mixed effects model for repeated measures.

Page 99/174 
 
 
 
 
 
- Treatment-Related Symptoms  
While on treatment, a small improvement in scores for constipation was observed in the pola+R-CHP arm 
compared to the R-CHOP arm (range of mean change from baseline: -4.9 to -7.6 vs. -1.1 to -5.3). A small 
increase in diarrhea scores in the pola+R-CHP arm compared to the R-CHOP arm was observed at Cycle 2 
(mean change from baseline: 6.3 vs. -0.02), however subsequent scores improved (range of mean change 
from baseline: 1.2 to 1.6 vs. -0.6 to 0.1). Scores for nausea and vomiting were very low at baseline (mean 
[SE]:  8.4  [0.916]  vs.  6.2  [0.722]),  and no  difference  was  observed  while  on  treatment  (range of  mean 
change  from  baseline:  1.7  to  1.7  vs.  -0.1  to  1.2).  Any  increase  observed  was  reversed  by  treatment 
completion.  
- Peripheral Neuropathy 
Both arms showed low levels of peripheral neuropathy at baseline (baseline mean [SE]: 39.8 [0.221] vs. 
39.5 [0.248]). The possible range for the scores is 0−44 for this subscale, with higher scores representative 
of lower levels of peripheral neuropathy. Patients in the R-CHOP arm experienced increases in peripheral 
neuropathy earlier (Cycle 4; mean change from baseline: pola+R-CHP: -0.5 vs. R-CHOP: -1.5) than patients 
in the pola+R-CHP arm (Cycle 6; -2.0 vs. -2.9). In addition, timepoints subsequent Cycle 4 showed larger 
increases in peripheral neuropathy (i.e. larger decreases in the mean scores) for R-CHOP (range of mean 
change from baseline: -2.2 to -3.5) than for pola+R-CHP (-1.0 to -2.7) while on treatment. 
Ancillary analyses 
Biomarker Analyses  
Methods 
The  cell-of-origin  (COO)  status  of  individual  patients  was  determined  by  the  Nanostring  Lymphoma 
Subtyping (LST) (Scott et al. 2014; Scott et al. 2015) assay using RNA extracted from baseline formalin 
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples/slides performed centrally at Expression Analysis. 
Baseline  protein  expression  of  BCL2  and  MYC 
in  tumor  cells  was  assessed  centrally  by 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  assays  at  Ventana  (ex-China)  or  Roche  Oncology  Biomarker  Development 
(OBD) China lab (for patients enrolled in mainland China only) using the analytically validated BCL2 (124) 
mAB  and  MYC  (Y69)  IHC  assays  on  the  Ventana  Benchmark  XT  platform.  BCL2+  was  defined  as  ≥50% 
tumor  cells  with  moderate  (IHC  2+)  or  strong  (IHC  3+)  staining intensity.  MYC+was  defined  as  ≥  40% 
tumor nuclei with positive MYC staining at any intensity above background staining (Punnoose et al 2020; 
Morschhauser et al 2021). 
Gene translocations involving BCL2, BCL6, and MYC (dual translocations in BCL2 or BCL6 and MYC [DHL]; 
or triple translocations in BCL2, BCL6 and MYC [THL]) defined specific DLBCL subgroups with particularly 
poor  outcomes  using  SoC  therapies.  In  POLARIX,  translocations  involving  these  three  genes  were 
determined  using  baseline  FFPE  tissue  slides  by  florescent  in-situ  hybridization  (FISH)  assay  performed 
centrally at Histogenix (ex-China) or KingMed (for patients enrolled in mainland China only). 
The translocation status of individual genes was evaluated for at least 50 tumor nuclei within the tumor 
region as annotated by a pathologist on the HE reference slide.

Negative cutoff values for individual FISH assay are determined by the vendors using tonsil samples from 
healthy donors. Given that BCL6 translocation mainly occurs concurrently with MYC translocation (Scott et 
al  2018),  BCL6  FISH  assay  was  performed  only  in  patients  with  positive  MYC  translocation  results  (not 
performed in patients from mainland China). 
Results 
Exploratory analyses of unstratified Investigator-assessed PFS in subgroups by baseline molecular DLBCL 
subtypes (by centrally tested COO, centrally tested IHC for BCL2 and MYC [DEL], and centrally tested FISH 
for rearrangements in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 [DHL/THL]) were performed (Figure 8). Treatment with pola+R-
CHP  resulted  in  numerically  higher  PFS  over  R-CHOP  among  patients  in  some  of  the  more  commonly 
represented high risk patient subgroups: • for the ABC-DLBCL subgroup, the 2-year investigator-assessed 
PFS rate was 83.9% in the pola+R-CHP arm vs. 58.8% in the R-CHOP arm (HR: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.60]) 
• for the DEL subgroup, the 2-year investigator-assessed PFS rate was 75.5% in the pola+R-CHP arm vs. 
63.1%  in  the  R-CHOP  arm  (HR:  0.64  [95%  CI:  0.42,  0.97]).  The  numbers of  patients  in  the  DH+/TH+ 
subgroup  (pola+R-CHP:  26  patients,  R-CHOP:  19  patients),  and  PFS  events  identified  in  the  DH/TH+ 
subgroup are too small to make a meaningful assessment.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  (Study  GO39942:  POLARIX)  is  a  phase  III,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-
CHP versus R-CHOP in previously untreated patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  
Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  acceptable  and  are  in  accordance  with  the  claimed  indication.  The 
inclusion  of  IPI  2-5  allows  to  include  higher  risk  populations  who  historically  had  poor  outcomes  with 
standard-of-care  therapy,  and  also  reflects  the  patient  population  included  in  the  early  GO29044  trial. 
Stratification factors (IPi score, bulky disease, geographical region) are deemed appropriate. 
Patients  received  six  cycles  of  either  pola+R-CHP  (and  vincristine  placebo)  or  standard  R-CHOP 
chemotherapy  (and  polatuzumab  vedotin  placebo)  at  21-day  intervals.  Both  arms  then  received  two 
additional  cycles  of  single  agent  rituximab.  The  approach  to  withdraw  vincristine  from  the  pola-based 
regimen is acknowledged in order to exclude a risk of cumulative neurotoxicity. The polatuzumab vedotin

dose of 1.8 mg/kg given every 21 days in combination with R/G-CHP for 6 or 8 cycles was determined in 
the dose-finding study (Study GO29044) which is acceptable. 
This design is acceptable as R-CHOP remains the standard of care therapy in previously untreated DLBCL. 
While R-CHOP may cure approximately 60% of patients with previously untreated DLBCL (Sehn and Salles 
2021),  alternative  strategies  have  so  far  been  unable  to  demonstrate  meaningful  benefit  over  R-CHOP. 
These  include:  increased  dose  density  with  R-CHOP  given  at  14  day  intervals  (Delarue  et  al  2013; 
Cunningham et al. 2013); dose intensification with dose-adjusted etoposide plus prednisone, vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R), Bartlett et al 2019; substitution strategies 
such as the novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab (Votolo et al 2017). 
The  efficacy  analysis  set,  multiplicity  adjustment  procedure  and  statistical  methods  are  generally 
acceptable.  
The primary endpoint is the PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease 
progression or relapse as assessed by the investigator, using the Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma, or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier. The PFS primary censoring rules follow the 
recommendations of the EMA guideline, with a set of sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of 
missing assessments or use of new anti-lymphoma therapy. It was agreed in the 2017 SA that a blinded 
independent central review of PFS was not required based on the study design.  
Key secondary endpoints were included in the hierarchical testing procedure: EFSeff as determined by the 
investigator, CR rate at end of treatment by FDGPET as determined by BICR and OS.  
Several important changes were made to the planned analyses, mostly as part of protocol amendments 5 
and 6, including modifications to the hierarchical testing strategy and timing of the primary analysis. It is 
noted that the actual number of PFS events observed according to the updated rule is, in the end, relatively 
close to the original plan. For this reason, and given the double-blind nature of the study, these updates to 
planned analyses are not thought to have major impact on the overall interpretation of the study results. 
The difference in EFS only reached statistical significance because CR rate at end of treatment by PET-CT 
as  determined  by  BICR  was  shifted  to  a  lower  position  in  hierarchy.  This  adds  some  uncertainty  on  the 
hypotheses  and  the  confirmatory  interpretation  of  EFS.  However,  since  there  is  currently  no  reason  to 
assume that the blind was compromised, this uncertainty is small. 
Major protocol deviations were reported under the following four categories: inclusion criteria, exclusion 
criteria, procedural and medication. Number of major protocol deviations were low and balanced in both 
arms (29 in pola + R-CHP arm and 26 in R-CHOP arm). This should not impact efficacy data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 879 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 440 in pola+R-CHP arm and 
439 in R-CHOP arm. Treatment arms were generally well-balanced with respect to demographic (age, sex, 
race, height, weight, geographic region) and baseline characteristics (ECOG performance status, Ann Arbor 
stage, IPI Score, presence of Bulky disease or not, bone marrow involvement, number of extranodal sites 
and NHL histologic diagnosis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/112106/2022 
Page 104/174 
 
 
 
 
For both regimens, treatment exposure remained high. A high proportion of patients (91.7% receiving pola 
as  part  of  the  pola+RCHP  regimen  and  88.5%  receiving  vincristine  as  part  of  the  R-CHOP  regimen) 
completed the planned 6 cycles of study treatment. Approximately 90% of patients in each treatment arm 
received 6 cycles of CHP treatment.  
At the CCOD, the median duration of PFS follow-up was 24.7 months in both arms with a minimum of 24 
months from study enrolment in both arms. A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint 
of  Investigator-assessed  PFS  is  observed  following  treatment  with  pola+R-CHP  compared  to  R-CHOP.  A 
reduction in the risk of progression/relapse or death by 27% is observed in patients treated in pola+R-CHP 
arm (stratified HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.95]; two-sided log-rank p-value=0.0177, two-sided α=0.05). 
Fewer patients in the pola+R-CHP arm had progressed or died compared to the R-CHOP arm (107 [24.3%] 
vs.134 [30.5%]).  
Low maturity of PFS is reflected in relevant subgroups. Point estimates raise concern that there may be no 
benefit over R-CHOP in patients with IPI 2 as well as patients with bulky disease. It is currently unclear 
from the submitted data whether there were too few events in these patients to observe a treatment effect 
(confidence intervals are admittedly rather wide); of note IPI score and bulky disease were stratification 
factors.  The  study,  however,  is  not  powered  to  independently  show  effects  in subgroups.  Moreover,  the 
substitution setting must be considered; there is a benefit of vincristine compared to which polatuzumab is 
overall superior. These analyses are neither type 1 error controlled nor powered for independent inferences; 
moreover there are no truly worrying outlying observations.  
Results  of  all  sensitivity  analyses  were  consistent  with  results  of  the  primary  analysis  of  Investigator-
assessed PFS in the ITT population. Of note, in some of these analyses, the significance threshold is crossed. 
These results confirm the slight improvement of PFS observed in the primary analysis.  
Further, with a median of two years follow up, curves remain separated. The follow-up time of at least 24 
months is considered sufficient as most relapses occur within the first 12-18 months. Patients with DLBCL 
without relapse at 24 months is considered to have a relapse risk of 8% and a survival similar to the normal 
population (Maurer et al. 2014). 
Regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoints: EFSeff, a significant reduction in the risk of occurrence of 
disease by 25% was observed in patients treated in pola+R-CHP arm compared in patients treated in R-
CHOP arm (stratified HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.96]). Only a difference of 26 events was observed between 
both arms (2 due to death, 20 due to disease progression and 4 due to start of a NALT or a positive biopsy).  
BICR-assessed CR rate was high (78.0% [95%CI: 73.79, 81.74] vs. 74.0% [95% CI: 69.66, 78.07]) but 
similar in both arms (treatment difference: 3.92 [95% CI: -1.89, 9.70]). In addition, concordance between 
BICR and Investigator assessments of CR was high (88.7%). 
Notably, this is a curative setting. As stated in the introduction, “R-CHOP may cure approximately 60% of 
patients with previously untreated DLBCL”. Moreover, the test regimen is a substitution of polatuzumab 
for vincristine. The treatment duration of test versus reference is limited to 6 cycles of 21 days, which is 
18 weeks.  
The OS results provided in this report come from the interim OS analysis performed at the time of the PFS 
analysis (stratified HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.65, 1.37]). The immaturity of OS data is expected to be a limitation 
to the interpretation of efficacy results. More generally, the study lacks power for OS, even for the final

analysis. This issue was discussed with the Applicant at the time of the 2017 scientific advice. It is noted 
that a total of 53 deaths (12.0% patients) were reported in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 57 deaths (13.0% 
patients)  were  reported  in  the  R-CHOP  arm.  With  very  few  events  in  both  arms,  OS  results  were  still 
immature at the time of the interim analysis of OS and did not meet the pre-specified threshold for statistical 
significance (stratified HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.65, 1.37])”. Finally, a 60% cure rate is anticipated in the control 
arm. Therefore, duration of follow-up rather than “maturity” of OS seems to be the key parameter here.  
Follow-up anti-lymphoma treatments have been provided by the MAH. The number of patients each 
receiving radiotherapy, systemic therapy, chimeric antigen receptors cell therapy (CAR-T) were slighlty 
higher in the R-CHOP arm compared to the pola+R-CHP arm. It is interesting to note that in the pola+R-
CHP arm, 3.9% of patients received stem cell transplants (n=30), compared with 7.1% in the R-CHOP 
arm (n=17). Also, in the pola+R-CHP arm 2.0% of patients received CAR-T (n=16), compared with 3.6% 
(n=9) in the R-CHOP arm. 
Patient-reported outcomes analysis showed that impacts of pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP regimens on 
improvement in physical functioning, fatigue, lymphoma symptoms were similar. Also, no improvement in 
treatment-related symptoms and peripheral neuropathy were observed between both regimens. 
Finally, for the HGBCL subgroup (N=93) the HR was 0.48 (0.21,1.08). Although HGBCL is a separate 
disease entity according to the WHO classification of 2016, a specific mention of HGBCL in the indication 
required extrapolation of efficacy and B/R from a DLBCL- to a HGBL population; these considerations 
were not possible on the current data. The initial indication as proposed by the MAH:  “Polivy in 
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)” is 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
The recommended dose of Polivy is 1.8 mg/kg, given as an intravenous infusion every 21 days in 
combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) for 6 cycles. Polivy, 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin can be administered in any order on Day 1 after the 
administration of prednisone. Prednisone is administered on Days 1-5 of each cycle. Cycles 7 and 8 
consist of rituximab as monotherapy. 
Per current Polivy SmPC Annex II.E, provision of efficacy and safety data by Q4 2021 is the last 
remaining specific obligation (SOB-CLIN-003) to the CMA of Polivy for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant. The MAH 
believes that with the submission of this Type II variation, all specific obligations related to the 
conditional marketing authorization (CMA) are fulfilled. As a result, the MAH is requesting a full marketing 
authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (marketing authorisation 
not subject to specific obligations).   
Interim OS results are still immature and could be considered as not sufficiently robust.  However, OS 
interim results do not indicate detrimental effect of polatuzumab vedotin. The pivotal POLARIX study met 
its primary endpoint PFS and no meaningful differences in safety risks have been retrieved. Therefore, 
efficacy and safety data provided from untreated patients could be considered as confirmatory safety and 
efficacy data for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory DLCBL. Therefore, obligations related to 
CMA are considered fulfilled. 
The MAH have presented data based on a double blinded RCT where efficacy and safety of the 
substitution of vincristine with polatuzumab in the well-established 1L regimen R-CHOP have been 
assessed for 1L DLBCL. The study is statistically positive by acceptable standards. The MAH will provide 
the final OS results by Q4 2022 as a post approval measure.  This is acceptable in order to obtain more 
long-term efficacy and safety data in this first line indication (see RMP). The CHMP also requested data

from an additional Chinese cohort. The MAH has requested approval for providing and opening access to 
Chinese Human Genetic Resources abroad from the Human Genetics Resources Administration of China 
(HGRAC) and would be able to provide the data from China extension cohort, in the form of Asia 
subpopulation CSR, if granted by HGRAC.    
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of Investigator-assessed PFS is observed 
following treatment with pola+R-CHP compared to R-CHOP. A reduction in the risk of progression/relapse 
or death by 27% is observed in patients treated in pola+R-CHP arm (HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.95]. 
Results of secondary and sensitivity analyses were consistent with results of the primary analysis.  
The PFS gain is sufficient to establish the efficacy and positive B/R of polatuzumab as substitute for 
vincristine. Further, as outlined above, given that treatment was 4-5 months and median time of follow-
up is more than two years, it does not seem reasonable to anticipate any emerging detriment in OS of 
polatuzumab when substituted for vincristine. 
Obligations related to CMA are considered fulfilled. The updated CSR at the time of final overall survival 
analysis containing final OS data -is expected to be submitted (see RMP).  
Further,  following  the  recommendation  of  the  CHMP,  the  Applicant  will  submit  the  data  from  the  China 
extension cohort of Study GO39942 (POLARIX) that are analyzed within an Asia subpopulation analysis and 
are reported in an Asia subpopulation CSR that includes all Chinese patients enrolled in the China extension 
and in the main global study, as well as patients from other Asian countries who were enrolled in the main 
global study Polarix. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
As of 31 August 2021, polatuzumab in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) is approved for 
the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL in >65 countries/regions including the European Union 
(EU) and United States (US). 
The  claimed  indication  in  this  application  is  in  the  first-line  DLBCL  setting  for  pola  in  combination  with 
rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  and  prednisone  (R-CHP).  Safety  data  for  pola  1.8  mg/kg  in 
combination with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL is based on the pivotal study POLARIX. 
At the time of the primary analysis (CCOD: 28 June 2021), the safety-evaluable population comprised of 
873 patients who received at least one dose of study treatment with 435 patients in the pola+R-CHP arm 
and 438 patients in the R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) 
arm. 
Additional supportive data are presented from a cohort of patients with previously untreated DLBCL (n=66) 
who received pola 1.8 mg/kg in combination with R-CHP (n=45) or G-CHP (n=21) in the GO29044 study. 
The pooled population comprised all patients from POLARIX and GO29044 with previously untreated 
DLBCL receiving pola 1.8 mg/kg in combination with R-CHP/G-CHP (n=501).

Table 24. Summary of Studies Contributing to Safety Evaluation 
Patient exposure 
Study POLARIX 
After initiation of study drug, all AEs regardless of relationship to study drug were reported until 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug, unless the patient begins a new anti-lymphoma therapy (NALT). This was 
defined as the treatment-emergent AE interval. All adverse events of special interest considered related to 
study drug by the investigator were reported until 12 months after the last dose of study drug. 
The median Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) was >99.8% for all components of treatment in each arm. There 
was 93.6% (407/435) of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 90.6% (397/438) of patients the R-CHOP 
arm receiving at least 6 cycles of any study drug; 89.2% of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 86.3% of 
patients in the R-CHOP arm received 8 cycles of rituximab. A higher number of patients received all six 
planned  doses  of  pola  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  (91.7%  among  patients  who  received  any  dose  of  pola 
[n=435]) compared to the number of patients who received all six planned doses of vincristine in the R-
CHOP arm (88.5% among patients who received any dose of vincristine [n=436]). 
Patients  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  received  a  median  of  6  cycles  of  pola  (range  1-6),  corresponding  to  a 
median treatment duration of 3.5 months. Mean (SD) cumulative dose of pola received by patients in the 
pola+R-CHP arm was 774.5 mg (228.9 mg). 
Patients in the R-CHOP arm received a median of 6 cycles of vincristine (range 1-6), corresponding to a 
median treatment duration of 3.5 months. Mean (SD) cumulative dose of vincristine received by patients 
in the R-CHOP arm was 11.2 mg (2.1 mg).

Patients in both the pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP arms also received a median of 8 cycles of rituximab (range 
1-8). This corresponds to a median treatment duration of 4.9 months in both treatment arms. A total 
of 89.2% of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 86.3% of patients in the R-CHOP arm completed 8 cycles 
of rituximab.

Pooled safety population 
Relative dose intensity was high with a median RDI of >99.8% for all components of study treatment. 
Patients received a median of 6.0 cycles of pola (range 1-8), corresponding to a median treatment duration 
of  3.5  months  (Table  5).  Mean  (SD)  cumulative  dose  of  pola  received  by  patients  in  the  pooled  safety

Patients in the pooled safety population received a median of 8.0 cycles of rituximab (range 1-8) or 6.0 
cycles of obinutuzumab (range 1-8). This corresponds to a median treatment duration of 4.9 months for 
rituximab and 3.5 months for obinutuzumab. 
The median number of cycles of exposure to CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) in the 
pooled  safety  population  was  6.0  (range  1  –  8),  corresponding  to  a  median  of  3.5  to  3.6  months  of

Adverse events of special interest 
Events of neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy (PN), infections, hepatic toxicity, anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
tumor  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  pulmonary  toxicity  and  secondary  malignancies  of  all  grades  have  been 
observed  in  patients  treated  with  pola  as  a  single  agent  or  in  combination  treatments,  therefore,  these 
events  have  been  considered  as  adverse  events  of  particular  interest  (AEPIs).  Hyperglycemia,  cardiac 
arrhythmia and infusion-related reactions (IRR) were also AEPIs. 
• 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Study POLARIX 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced PN (52.9%) in the pola+R-CHP arm was comparable 
with the R-CHOP arm (53.9%) and the majority of patients experienced low grade PN. 
Among  patients  in  pola+R-CHP  arm  who  developed  PN  events,  170/230  (73.9%)  had  Grade  1  PN  and 
53/230 (23.0%) had Grade 2 PN. This compares with 163/236 (69.1%) patients in the R-CHOP arm with 
Grade 1 PN and 68/236 (28.8%) patients with Grade 2 PN, indicating that a higher proportion of patients 
in the pola+R-CHP arm experienced low-grade PN compared with the R-CHOP arm. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  Grade  3  PN  (highest  grade)  was  1.6%  (7  patients)  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm and 1.1% (5 patients) in the R-CHOP arm. No patients in either arm experienced Grade 
4 or Grade 5 PN events. 
The most commonly reported PN events by PT (≥ 2% of patients in either arm) were neuropathy peripheral 
(24.1% and 22.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (19.5% and 21.5%), paraesthesia (6.7% and 4.6%), 
hypoaesthesia  (3.7%  and  3.2%),  polyneuropathy  (1.4%  and  2.5%),  and  peripheral  motor  neuropathy 
(0.7% and 2.3%) in the pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP arms, respectively. 
The majority of patients (93.8% in the pola+R-CHP arm and 92.2% in the R-CHOP arm) had no prior history 
of  PN.  In  the  pola+R-CHP  arm,  of  the  230  patients  who  experienced  a  PN  event  during  treatment,  16 
patients had a history of prior PN, and of these, 14 patients had ongoing PN at baseline. In the R-CHOP 
arm, of the 236 patients who experienced a PN event during treatment, 14 patients had a history of prior 
PN, and of these, 10 patients had ongoing PN at baseline. The proportion of patients who experienced a 
serious PN event was the same in each arm (0.2% [1 patient]). 
Median time to onset of first PN was 2.27 months (range: 0.0 – 6.7 months) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 
1.87 months (range: 0.0 – 8.1 months) in the R-CHOP arm. 
Resolution of PN was reported in the majority of patients at the time of CCOD, with more patients having 
had resolution of PN in the R-CHOP arm (66.9% [158/236 patients with events]) compared with the pola+R-
CHP arm (57.8% [133/230 patients with events]). 
The later time to onset of PN events in the pola+R-CHP arm compared with the R-CHOP arm, in combination 
with similar median time to PN resolution (4.04 months [range: 0.0 – 36.0 months] in the pola+R-CHP arm 
and 4.60 months [range: 0.0 – 34.9 months] in the R-CHOP arm), likely contributed to more patients with 
unresolved PN in the Pola+RCHP arm at the time of CCOD.

A total of 26/66 patients (39.4%) experienced 36 peripheral neuropathy events during the study (Table 
15). Twenty-five (of 62) patients with no prior history of PN experienced treatment-emergent peripheral 
neuropathy and 1 of 4 patients with PN ongoing at baseline experienced a worsening of PN during the study. 
Eighteen patients  experienced  Grade  1  PN  (worst  grade)  and 6  patients  experienced  Grade 2  PN  (worst 
grade). Two patients had Grade 3 events (1 during post-treatment follow up and 1 during treatment, dose 
not changed). Three patients had study treatment (pola) dose reduced due to a PN event (2 Grade 2 events, 
1 Grade 1 event) and 1 patient discontinued study treatment (pola) due to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. 
At the time of the CCOD for the final analysis for GO29044 all PN events were reported as resolved in 20 
of the 26 patients with PN events. Median time to onset of first treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy 
event  was  2.51  months  (range  0.1-8.0  months).  Median  time  to  resolution  of  first  treatment-emergent 
peripheral neuropathy was 2.40 months (range: 0.1 – 25.0 months). 
Pooled safety population 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced PN in the pooled safety population (51.1% [256/501 
patients]) was consistent with the pola+R-CHP arm from POLARIX and comparable with the R-CHOP arm 
(53.9% [236/438 patients]).

Study POLARIX 
Assessment report  
EMA/287823/2022 
Page 121/174 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced hepatic toxicity in the pola+R-CHP arm (10.6%) was 
slightly higher than the R-CHOP arm (7.3%). The majority of hepatic toxicity events were low-grade liver 
enzyme elevations in both the treatment arms. No patients experienced Grade 4 or Grade 5 hepatic toxicity 
events. 
Median  time  to  onset  of  first  hepatic  toxicity  event  was  0.85  months  (range:  0.0  –  6.7  months)  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm and 0.69 months (range: 0.0 – 5.2 months) in the R-CHOP arm. 
Hepatic toxicity was reported as resolved in 87.0% (40/46 patients with events) in the pola+R-CHP arm 
and 84.4% (27/32 patients with events) in the R-CHOP arm, as of the CCOD. Median time to resolution of 
hepatic  toxicity  was  0.56  months  (range:  0.1  –  9.1  months)  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  0.54  months 
(range: 0.1 – 14.3 months) in the RCHOP arm. 
Using  an  algorithm  based  on  laboratory  values  of  liver  enzymes  in  combination  with  elevated  bilirubin 
levels/clinical jaundice, potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) were identified in 1 patient in the 
pola+R-CHP arm and 2 patients in the R-CHOP arm. All cases were confounded by concomitant medical 
conditions and the underlying illness. 
In the pola+R-CHP arm, 1 case of potential DILI was identified: 
–  Patient 10688 - This 55-year-old female patient presented Grade 4 cytopenia on Study Day 10. On 
Study  Day  12,  the  patient  experienced  life-threatening  sepsis  with  a  blood  culture  positive  for 
Staphylococcus  aureus,  and  was  treated  with  antibiotics.  The  events  of  cytopenia  and  sepsis 
resolved by Study Day 16. Elevated ALT and bilirubin were noted on Study Day 23; however, no 
AEs relating to the abnormal liver enzymes were reported. The patient received study treatment 
on Study Day 23 (Cycle 2, Day 1) as planned. This case is confounded by the event of sepsis in the 
period preceding the ALT and bilirubin increase. 
In the R-CHOP arm, 2 cases of potential DILI were identified: 
–  Patient number 10762- The first was a 49-year-old male patient with a medical history of biliary 
tract  infection.  On  Study  Day  10,  laboratory  work-up  showed  Grade  4  neutropenia  and  Grade  1 
abnormal hepatic function. On Study Day 11, the patient was hospitalized for fever and persistent 
neutropenia. A blood culture was positive for Escherichia coli and the patient was diagnosed with 
Escherichia sepsis. The abnormal hepatic function worsened to Grade 3. The patient was treated 
with antibiotics and the events of neutropenia, sepsis and abnormal hepatic function resolved by 
Study Day 22. This case is confounded by the event of E.coli sepsis and history of prior biliary tract 
infection. 
–  Patient number 10802 - The second patient, a 69-year-old male received study treatment (Cycle 5 
Day  1)  on  Study  Day  83.  On  Study  Day  89,  the  patient  was  hospitalized  with  Grade  4  febrile 
neutropenia. On Study Day 90, the patient was diagnosed with Grade 3 pneumonia, and laboratory 
work-up showed elevated liver enzymes, total bilirubin, creatinine, urea, C-reactive protein, and 
decreased platelets, WBC count and hemoglobin. The patient was diagnosed with life-threatening 
Grade  4  multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome  and  was  discontinued  from  study  treatment.  The 
patient died due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on Study Day 157. No other AEs related 
to abnormal liver function were reported. This case is confounded by multiple organ dysfunction in 
the setting of febrile neutropenia. 
Supportive study GO29044 
Five of 66 patients (7.6%) experienced 8 hepatic toxicity events with a median time to onset of 2.00 months 
(range:  0.3-4.1  months).  One  patient  experienced  a  Grade  ≥3  hepatic  toxicity  AE  (gamma-
glutamyltransferase increased [Grade 3]). All other events were Grade ≤ 2.

No hepatic toxicity SAEs were reported and no patient had their study treatment dose changed as a result 
of  a  hepatic  toxicity  event.  All  hepatic toxicity  events  were  reported  as  resolved  at  data  cut-off.  Median 
time to resolution of hepatic toxicity was 0.61 months (range 0.1-3.1 months). 
Pooled safety population 
The proportion of patients who experienced hepatic toxicity in the pooled safety population (10.2% [51/501

Study POLARIX 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  a  carcinogenicity/secondary  malignancy  during  the 
treatment-emergent AE interval (90 days after last dose of study drug or prior to NALT, whichever is earlier) 
in the pola+R-CHP arm (0.9% [4 patients]) was comparable with the R-CHOP arm (1.1% [5 patients]). 
Grade 3-4 carcinogenicity events (highest grade) were reported in 0.9% (4 patients) in the pola+R-CHP 
arm and 0.5% (2 patients) in the R-CHOP arm. No patients experienced a Grade 5 carcinogenicity event. 
The proportion of patients who experienced a serious carcinogenicity event in the pola+R-CHP arm (0.7% 
[3  patients])  was  comparable  with  the  R-CHOP  arm  (0.2%  [1  patient]).  No  patients  in  either  arm 
experienced  a  carcinogenicity  event  that  led  to  study  treatment  discontinuation,  dose  reduction  or 
treatment interruption. 
Median  time  to  onset  of  first  carcinogenicity  event  was  5.86  months  (range:  2.7  –  6.5  months)  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm and 5.06 months (range: 3.4 – 6.8 months) in the R-CHOP arm. Carcinogenicity events 
were reported as resolved in 1 of 4 patients with events in the pola+R-CHP arm and 3 of 5 patients with 
events in the R-CHOP arm, as of the CCOD. Median time to resolution of the carcinogenicity event was 3.25 
months  in  the  patient  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  5.06  months  (range:  0.0  –  12.2  months)  for  the  3 
patients in the R-CHOP arm.

Infusion-related reactions 
As all components of the study treatment were administered on Day 1 of the first and subsequent treatment 
cycles, infusion-related reactions (IRRs) described in this section were identified based on entries in the 
Adverse Event page of the eCRF which met the following criteria: 
– AEs suspected by the investigator to be caused by any study drug of the combination treatment (pola+R-
CHP or R-CHOP) that occurred during infusion or within 24 hours after end of infusion. 
– AE PT was one of the PTs identified as associated with Infusion-Related Reaction 
Study POLARIX 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced IRRs in the pola+R-CHP arm (13.3%) was comparable 
with the R-CHOP arm (16.0%). Most IRR events were low grade and non-serious. 
No patient in the pola+R-CHP arm and 1 patient (0.2%) in the R-CHOP arm experienced an IRR that led to 
study treatment discontinuation. 
No patient in either arm experienced an IRR that led to any study treatment dose reduction. The proportion 
of patients who experienced IRRs that led to study treatment interruption in the pola+R-CHP arm (4.1%)

The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  a  Grade  3-4  cardiac  arrhythmia  event  (highest  grade)  was 
0.5% (2 patients) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 0.7% (3 patients) in the R-CHOP arm. No patients in the 
pola+R-CHP arm experienced a Grade 5 cardiac arrhythmia event compared with 1 patient (0.2%) in the 
R-CHOP arm. 
Median time to onset of first cardiac arrhythmia was 2.17 months (range: 0.0 – 4.8 months) in the pola+R-
CHP arm and 3.45 months (range: 0.0 – 7.4 months) in the R-CHOP arm. Cardiac arrhythmia was reported 
as resolved in 61.5% (8/13 patients with events) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 55.0% (11/20 patients with 
events)  in  the  R-CHOP  arm,  as  of  the  CCOD.  Median  time  to  resolution  of  cardiac  arrhythmia  was  0.07 
months (range: 0.0 – 3.1 months) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 0.07 months (range: 0.0 – 9.9 months) in 
the R-CHOP arm. 
Study GO29044 
Three of 66 patients (4.5%) experienced 5 cardiac  arrhythmia events (Table 25) with a median time to 
onset of 2.60 months (range: 0.1-7.8 months). Two patients experienced a Grade ≥3 cardiac arrhythmia

•  Hyperglycemia 
Study POLARIX 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  hyperglycemia  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  (6.0%)  was 
comparable with the R-CHOP arm (6.2%). 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia (highest grade) was reported in 1.8% (8 patients) in the pola+RCHP arm and 1.4% 
(6 patients) in the R-CHOP arm. No patients in either arm experienced Grade 4 or Grade 5 hyperglycemia. 
Median  time  to  onset  of  first  hyperglycemia  event  was  0.79  months  (range:  0.0  –  3.0  months)  in  the 
pola+R-CHP  arm  and  0.72  months  (range:  0.0  –  3.5  months)  in  the  R-CHOP  arm.  Hyperglycemia  was 
reported  as  resolved  in  53.8%  (14/26  patients  with  events)  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  48.1%  (13/27 
patients with events) in the R-CHOP arm, as of the CCOD. Median time to resolution of hyperglycemia was 
2.28 months (range: 0.0 – 5.8 months) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 0.66 months (range: 0.1 – 8.8 months) 
in the R-CHOP arm. 
Study GO29044 
A total of 6/66 patients (9.1%) experienced 10 events of hyperglycemia with a median time to onset of 
0.39 months (range: 0.3 - 2.9 months). 
Four patients experienced Grade ≥3 hyperglycemia; all 4 patients experienced Grade 3 events. All other 
events were Grade ≤ 2. 
One SAE was reported (Grade 3 hyperglycemia) which was considered related to prednisone. No patient 
experienced a hyperglycemia event leading to study treatment discontinuation or interruption. One patient 
had their study treatment dose reduced.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Deaths 
Study POLARIX 
At the time of the clinical cut-off date (CCOD), a total of 111 patients (12.7%) had died due to any cause. 
The proportion of patients who died in the pola+R-CHP arm (12.0%) was comparable with the R-CHOP arm 
(13.5%).  The  most  common  cause  of  death  during  the  entire  study  period  in  both  treatment  arms  was 
disease progression (6.4% in the pola+R-CHP arm and 7.1% in the R-CHOP arm). Almost all deaths due to 
disease progression occurred during the follow-up period. Two patients (0.5%) in the R-CHOP arm died due 
to disease progression during the AE reporting period. 
Fatal AEs were reported in 3.0% of patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 2.5% of patients in the R-CHOP 
arm. Almost all deaths due to AEs occurred during the AE reporting period. One patient in the R-CHOP arm 
experienced a Grade 5 AE (acute myeloid leukemia) during the follow up period. Most of the fatal AEs in 
both arms were due to infections or complications of infection. 
The most frequent Grade 5 AEs (by PT) were pneumonia (4 patients [0.9%] in the pola+R-CHP arm and 3 
patients [0.7%] in the R-CHOP arm), death (4 patients [0.9%] in the pola+R-CHP arm and 1 patient [0.2%] 
in the R-CHOP arm) and septic shock (0 patients in the pola+R-CHP arm and 2 patients [0.5%] in the R-
CHOP arm). The proportion of patients who died due to AEs that were considered related to the treatment 
by the investigator was 1.4% (6 patients) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 1.1% (5 patients) in the R-CHOP 
arm. 
The treatment-related AEs that led to death in the pola+R-CHP arm were pneumonia (3 patients), cardiac 
death, acute kidney injury and death. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287823/2022 
Page 129/174 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment-related AEs that led to death in the R-CHOP arm were pneumonia (2 patients), multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome, and sepsis. One additional patient had a Grade 5 AE (acute myeloid leukemia) during 
the follow-up period which the investigator assessed as related to study treatment. 
Supportive study GO29044 
A total of 6 deaths were reported in the pola+R-CHP/G-CHP population; 2 patients died due to an AE (atrial 
fibrillation, septic shock) during the AE reporting interval and 4 patients died due to disease progression in 
the follow-up period . 
One  patient  with  a  history  of  mitral  valve  repair  and  concurrent  conditions  including  mitral  valve 
regurgitation and coronary artery disease, died due to atrial fibrillation. The investigator assessed this event 
as  unrelated  to  any  study  drug  and  related  to  concurrent  illness.  The  second  patient  died  due  to  septic 
shock considered related to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide treatment. 
Pooled safety population 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  died  in  the  pooled  safety  population  (11.6%  [58/501  patients])  was 
comparable with the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (13.5% [59/438 patients]). The most common cause of 
death in both treatment arms was disease progression (6.4% in the pooled safety population and 7.1% in 
the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX).

•  Other serious adverse event 
Study POLARIX 
The proportion of patients with at least one SAE in the pola+R-CHP arm (34.0%) was comparable with the 
R-CHOP arm (30.6%). 
SAEs were most commonly reported (≥5% of patients in either arm) in the following SOCs (pola+R-CHP 
arm and R-CHOP arm, respectively): 
– Infections and infestations (14.0% and 10.3%) 
– Blood and lymphatic system disorders (11.5% and 9.1%) 
– Gastrointestinal disorders (7.1% and 5.9%) 
– General disorders and administration site conditions (6.0% and 4.6%) 
The proportion of patients with at least one SAE considered related to treatment in the Pola+R-CHP arm 
(25.7%) was higher than in the R-CHOP arm (19.6%).  
The most common related SAEs by PT (≥1% of patients in either arm) were (pola+RCHP arm and R-CHOP 
arm, respectively): 
– Febrile neutropenia (9.7% and 5.7%) 
– Pneumonia (3.7% and 3.0%) 
– Diarrhea (2.3% and 0.2%) 
– Neutropenia (0.9% and 1.4%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/287823/2022

– Sepsis (0.9% and 1.1%) 
– Pyrexia (1.1% and 0.7%) 
– Urinary tract infection (1.1% and 0.2%) 
– Vomiting (1.1% and 0.5%). 
No patients in either treatment arm discontinued study treatment due to the SAEs of febrile neutropenia, 
diarrhea or urinary tract infection. 
Supportive study GO29044 
The majority of SAEs in Study GO29044 were due to cytopenia and infections. 
A total of 27/66 patients (40.9%) had SAEs. By SOC, SAEs reported in ≥5% of patients comprised of blood 
and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (16.7%),  and  infections  and  infestations  (13.6%).  By  preferred  term, 
febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, atrial fibrillation, influenza A virus test positive, syncope, pneumonia, and 
pulmonary embolism were the only SAEs reported in ≥1 patient. 
SAEs  considered  related  to  treatment  were  reported  in  17  patients  (25.8%).  The  SAEs  were  febrile 
neutropenia (6 patients), neutropenia (4 patients), pneumonia (3 patients), atrial fibrillation, clostridium 
difficile  infection,  oral  fungal  infection,  septic  shock,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  malnutrition,  hyperglycemia, 
asthenia, arthritis, and pulmonary embolism. With the exception of vomiting and a fatal SAE of septic shock 
in  one  patient  and  a  fatal  SAE  of  atrial  fibrillation  in  a  second  patient,  all  other  related  SAEs  were 
resolved/resolved with sequelae. 
Pooled safety population 
The proportion of patients with at least one SAE in the pooled safety population (34.9% [175/501 patients]) 
was  consistent  with  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  from  POLARIX  and  comparable  with  the  R-CHOP  arm  (30.6% 
[134/438 patients]).

In pivotal Study POLARIX, for all patients, the baseline prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was 2.4% 
(20/849 ADA evaluable patients). The 8 patients from the pola+R-CHP treatment arm who tested positive 
for  ADA  at  baseline  were  treatment  unaffected  (ADA  response  was  similar  to,  or  lower  than,  that  at 
baseline). Post-baseline, ADAs were detected in 6 of 427 (1.4%) ADA-evaluable patients treated with pola. 
All  6  ADA-positive  patients  had  treatment-induced  responses  (ADA  negative  at  baseline  or  missing  a 
baseline sample for ADA analysis and at least one positive post−baseline ADA result). All 6 patients with 
treatment-induced ADA were negative for neutralizing antibody.

At screening, 5 patients (1.2%) in the pola+R-CHP arm and 3 patients (0.7%) in the R-CHOP arm had a 
clinically significant ECG abnormality. 
Post-baseline, the proportion of patients with clinically significant ECG abnormalities was 1.3% (5 patients) 
in the pola+R-CHP arm and 1.0% (4 patients) in the R-CHOP arm.

•  Race 
Study POLARIX 
The  majority  of  enrolled  patients  were of  White  (N=523)  or  Asian  (N=168) ethnicity  and  assessment  of 
differences between other race subgroups could not be performed due to the small sample sizes in these 
race  subgroups  (American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native  [N=3],  Black  or  African  American  [N=17],  Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander [N=3], Other [N=17]). 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  was  generally  comparable  between  White  and  Asian  subgroups  with  some 
numerical differences. 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in a higher proportion of Asian patients (pola+R-CHP: 73.8% and R-CHOP: 
67.9%) compared with White patients (pola+R-CHP: 58.9% and R-CHOP: 59.6%) in both treatment arms. 
The proportion of deaths due to AEs was numerically higher in the White race subgroup (pola+R-CHP: 10 
deaths [4.3%] vs. R-CHOP: 8 deaths [3.4%]) compared with Asian race subgroup (pola+R-CHP: 1 death 
[1.2%] vs. RCHOP: 1 death [1.2%]). 
Supportive study GO29044 
The  majority  of  patients  enrolled  in  GO29044  were  White  (57/66  patients).  Overall,  no  assessment  of 
differences between race subgroups could be performed due to the small sample size in other race groups. 
•  Body weight 
To  investigate  the  incidence  of  AEs  by  weight,  patients  were  categorized  into  two  baseline  weight 
categories; ≤100 kg (N=847) and >100 kg (N=86).

R-CHP  did  not  appear  to  have  a  clinically  relevant  impact  on  the  PK  of  pola  when  given  in  combination 
based  on  observed  data  and  population  PK  analysis.  The  PK  of  pola  in  the  pivotal  POLARIX  study  and

provides  a  good  description  of  acMMAE  and  unconjugated  MMAE  concentrations  following  intravenous 
administration of pola+R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL. 
In the supportive Study GO29044, pola did not appear to have a clinically relevant impact on the PK of 
cyclophosphamide  or  doxorubicin  when  given  in  combination  based  on  observed  data.  No  significant 
difference in cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin PK was observed for DLBCL patients receiving 1.8 mg/kg of 
pola+R/G-CHP based on similar cross-cycle exposure comparisons of each analyte both prior to and after 
administration of pola (Shemesh et al. 2020). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
•  AEs leading to study discontinuation 
Study POLARIX 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to study discontinuation in the pola+R-CHP arm 
(3.0% [13 patients]) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm (2.3% [10 patients]). All AEs leading to study 
discontinuation were Grade 5 AEs. 
Supportive study GO29044 
The  events  that  led  to  study  withdrawal  were  events  associated  with  underlying  disease,  with  no 
apparent/clinically meaningful/relevant pattern among the other events leading to withdrawal. 
A  total  of  3/66  patients  (4.5%)  had  5  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation.  The  AEs  leading  to  study 
discontinuation by PT were Escherichia urinary tract infection, syncope and atrial fibrillation (both reported 
in the same patient), and pneumonia and coronary artery disease (both reported in the same patient). 
Pooled safety population 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  in  the  pooled  safety 
population  (3.2%  [16/501  patients])  was  consistent  with  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  from  POLARIX  and 
comparable  to  the  R-CHOP  arm  (2.3%  [10/438  patients]).  The  majority  of  events  that  led  to  study 
withdrawal were events associated with underlying disease, with no apparent/clinically meaningful/relevant 
pattern among the other events leading to study withdrawal.

•  AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
Study POLARIX 
Overall, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE leading to discontinuation of any study 
treatment in the pola+R-CHP arm (6.2%) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm (6.6%). 
In most SOCs, the proportion of patients discontinuing any study treatment due to an AE was comparable 
between the pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP arms. However, in the most common SOC with AEs leading to study 
treatment discontinuation for the R-CHOP arm (Nervous system disorders), a higher proportion of R-CHOP 
patients experienced an AE leading to discontinuation (2.5% [9 patients]) than the pola+R-CHP arm (0.7% 
[3 patients]). This difference was primarily driven by a higher incidence of AEs associated with peripheral 
neuropathy in the R-CHOP arm. 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of pola study treatment in the 
pola+R-CHP  arm  (4.4%)  was  comparable  to  the  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of vincristine study treatment in the R-CHOP arm (5.0%). 
A numerically higher percentage of patients experienced an AE in the Nervous system disorders SOC which 
led to vincristine discontinuation (2.1% [9 patients]) than led to pola discontinuation (0.7% [3 patients]). 
This difference was primarily driven by a higher incidence of AEs related to peripheral neuropathy in the R-
CHOP arm. In other SOCs, the proportion of patients discontinuing pola/vincristine in the pola+R-CHP and 
R-CHOP arms, respectively, was comparable. 
The most common AEs by PT (≥ 2 patients each in the pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP arm, respectively), leading 
to pola/vincristine treatment discontinuation were pneumonia (4 patients [0.9%] in each arm), neuropathy 
peripheral  (1  patient  [0.2%]  and  4  patients  [0.9%]),  peripheral  motor  neuropathy  (0  patients  and  2 
patients [0.5%]) and death (2 patients [0.5%] and 1 patient [0.2%]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of rituximab study treatment in 
the pola+R-CHP arm (4.6%) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm (4.8%). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of any of the components of the 
CHP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) in the pola+R-CHP arm (3.4%) was comparable 
to the R-CHOP arm (3.7%). 
Supportive study GO29044 
The majority of events that led to withdrawal of study treatment were consistent with the known risks of 
each individual component. 
A total of 8/66 patients (12.1%) in the pola+R-CHP/G-CHP population had AEs leading to discontinuation 
of  pola.  The  AEs  leading  to  pola  discontinuation  by  PT  were  neuropathy  peripheral,  syncope,  tremor, 
Escherichia urinary tract infection, septic shock, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and coronary artery 
disease. In the majority of patients, these AEs led to discontinuation of all the study drugs. 
Assessment report

A total of 7 patients (10.6%) had an AE leading to discontinuation of rituximab/obinutuzumab. AEs that led 
to  discontinuation  of  rituximab/obinutuzumab  were  Escherichia  urinary  tract  infection,  syncope,  tremor, 
febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and septic shock. 
A total of 7 patients (10.6%) had an AE leading to discontinuation of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or 
prednisone  (CHP).  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  any  of  the  CHP  study  treatments  were  Escherichia 
urinary tract infection, septic shock, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, syncope, tremor and coronary 
artery disease. 
Pooled safety population 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  of  any  component  of  the  study  treatment  was  comparable 
between the pooled safety population (7.0% [35/501 patients]) and the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (6.6% 
[29/438 patients]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of pola study treatment in the 
pooled  safety  population  (5.4%  [27/501  patients])  was  comparable  to  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of vincristine study treatment in the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX 
(5.0% [22/438 patients]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of rituximab/obinutuzumab study 
treatment in the pooled safety population (5.4% [27/501 patients]) was comparable to the proportion of 
patients who discontinued rituximab treatment in the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (4.8% [21/438 patients]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of any of the components of the 
CHP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) in the pooled safety population (4.4% [22/501 
patients]) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (3.7% [16/438 patients]).

•  AEs leading to treatment interruption 
Study POLARIX 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  leading  to  interruption  of  any  study  treatment  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm (23.7%) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm (25.3%) with the most commonly reported 
AEs leading to study treatment interruption in the pola+R-CHP arm being in the Infections and infestations 
SOC and the most commonly reported AEs leading to study treatment interruption in the R-CHOP arm being 
in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC. 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to pola treatment interruption in the pola+R-CHP 
arm  (14.0%)  was  comparable  to  the  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  leading  to  vincristine 
treatment interruption in the R-CHOP arm (13.7%). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to rituximab dose interruptions in the pola+R-CHP 
arm (22.3%) was comparable with the R-CHOP arm (23.7%). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to CHP dose interruptions in the pola+R-CHP arm 
(14.0%) was comparable with the R-CHOP arm (13.7%). 
Supportive study GO29044

A total of 6 patients (9.1%) had an AE leading to interruption of pola. AEs that led to interruption of pola 
were  pulmonary  embolism,  ophthalmic  herpes  zoster,  bronchitis,  pneumonia,  febrile  neutropenia  and 
neutropenia. 
Seventeen patients (17/66; 25.6%) had AEs leading to interruption of rituximab or obinutuzumab. AEs that 
led to dose interruption in more than 1 patient each were neutropenia (8 patients), infusion related reaction 
(4 patients) and thrombocytopenia (2 patients). 
Seven  patients  (7/66;  10.6%)  had  an  AE  leading  to  interruption  of  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  or 
prednisone  (CHP).  AEs  that  led  to  interruption  of  any  CHP  study  treatments  were  neutropenia,  febrile 
neutropenia,  pneumonia,  bronchitis,  ophthalmic  herpes  zoster,  catheter  site  pain,  and  pulmonary 
embolism. 
Pooled safety population 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to interruption of any study treatment in the pooled 
safety population 24.2% [121/501 patients]) was consistent with the pola+R-CHP arm from POLARIX and 
comparable to the R-CHOP arm (25.3% [111/438 patients]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to pola treatment interruption in the pooled safety 
population (13.4% [67/501 patients]) was comparable to the proportion of patients who experienced AEs 
leading to vincristine treatment interruption in the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (13.7% [60/438 patients]). 
The proportion of patients who experienced AEs leading to rituximab/obinutuzumab dose interruptions in 
the pooled safety population (22.8% [114/501 patients]) was comparable with the proportion of patients 
who had a rituximab treatment interruption in the R-CHOP arm from POLARIX (23.7% [104/438 patients]). 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  AEs  leading  to  CHP  dose  interruptions  in  the  pooled  safety 
population  (13.6%  [68/501  patients])  was  comparable  with  the  R-CHOP  arm  from  POLARIX  (13.7% 
[60/438 patients]). 
Post marketing experience 
POLIVY (polatuzumab vedotin) is approved in the EU, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, for 
the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  R/R  DLBCL  who  are  not  candidates  for  hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant,  and  in  the  US,  in  combination  with  bendamustine  and  rituximab,  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with R/R DLBCL, not otherwise specified, after at least two prior therapies. 
Since the International Birth Date (10 June 2019) through 09 June 2021, an estimated cumulative total of 
10,529 patients have received polatuzumab from marketing experience (United States n=3,693 patients; 
European  Union  n=5,613  patients;  Rest  of  the  World  n=1,223  patients).  No  new  or  unexpected  safety 
findings have been identified in the post-marketing setting. The regimen of polatuzumab in combination 
with R-CHP administered in the POLARIX study is not yet approved. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  data  for  polatuzumab  vedotin  1.8  mg/kg  in  combination  with  R-CHP  in  patients  with  previously 
untreated DLBCL is based on the pivotal study POLARIX, N=873 (N=435 in the pola+R-CHP arm and N=438 
in the R-CHOP arm). Additional supportive data from the GO29044 study are presented from a cohort of 
patients with previously untreated DLBCL (n=66) who received pola 1.8 mg/kg in combination with R-CHP 
Assessment report

(n=45)  or  G-CHP  (obinutuzumab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and  prednisone  [n=21]).  The  pooled 
population comprised all patients from POLARIX and GO29044 with previously untreated DLBCL receiving 
pola 1.8 mg/kg in combination with R-CHP/G-CHP (N=501). Separate data for pola +R-CHP and pola+G-
CHP in Study GO29044 would have allowed a direct comparison with the pola + R-CHP arm from POLARIX 
and a pooled population receiving similar treatment, therefore the MAH provided safety data from study 
GO29044 presented separately for pola +R-CHP and pola+G-CHP at least for all treatment-related AEs (all 
grades, grades 3-5 and SAEs). The nature and frequency of treatment-related AEs observed in the pola+R-
CHP arm of GO29044 were generally consistent with that observed in the pola+R-CHP of POLARIX (within 
the  limitation  of  the  overall  small  number  of  patients  in  GO29044).  It  is  noted  that  the  schedule  of 
treatments slightly differed across the two studies, i.e. 6 cycles for Pola + R-CHP in POLARIX with Rituximab 
as monotherapy in cycles 7 and 8 and 6-8 cycles for Pola + R-CHP and Pola + G-CHP in GO29044 study. 
Extent of exposure 
The period for AEs collection was similar across the two studies (90 days after the last dose of study drug). 
In  POLARIX  study,  the  extent  of  exposure  to  pola/vincristine,  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin 
and prednisone were similar across the 2 treatment arms.  
Overall the total duration of pola treatment and number of cycles of Pola were comparable across the 2 
studies, i.e. median duration of 3.5 months and median number of cycles of 6 for both studies. The median 
total cumulative dose of pola was however higher in GO29044 study compared to POLARIX study, i.e. 864 
mg in Pola+R-CHP arm in GO29044, 828 mg in Pola+G-CHP arm in GO29044 and 762.0 mg in Pola+R-CHP 
arm in POLARIX which is not considered unexpected based on the different schedule of treatments across 
the two studies.  
The exposure to rituximab was lower in Study GO29044 compared to POLARIX. In POLARIX the median 
number of cycles was 8 and the median total cumulative dose was 5329 mg for the Pola+R-CHP arm and 
5380  mg  for  R-CHOP  arm;  in  study  GO29044  the  median  number  of  cycles  was  6  and  median  total 
cumulative dose was 4625.00 mg. The cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin were higher 
in  Study  GO29044  compared  to  POLARIX,  and  similar  for  prednisone  across  the  2  studies.  It  cannot  be 
ruled  out  that  the  differences  observed  in  cumulative  dose  of  pola,  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide  and 
doxorubicin can have an impact on the safety profile in patients across the studies POLARIX and GO29044. 
The  median  RDI  was  >99.8%  for  all  components  of  study  treatment  in  both  studies  reflecting  a  high 
treatment compliance. 
Adverse events 
Overall  the  AEs  occurred  at  similar  rates  in  the  pooled  pola-treated  subjects  and  in  the  R-CHOP  arm  of 
POLARIX, 98.2% and 98.4% respectively. The majority of reported AEs in the safety population were Grade 
≥3 AEs, i.e. 61.5% in all pola + R-CHP/G-CHP pooled population and 59.8% in R-CHOP. Serious AEs were 
slightly more reported with all pola + R-CHP/G-CHP pooled population than with R-CHOP, i.e. 34.9% and 
30.6%. It is showed that grade 3-5 and serious AEs were more reported in the Pola+R-CHP/G-CHP group 
in GO29044 study than Pola+R-CHP arm in POLARIX. 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  the  pooled  safety  population  were  nausea  (42.3%),  neutropenia 
(32.1%), diarrhoea (33.3%), constipation (28.3%), fatigue (28.7%), anemia (28.7%), alopecia (23.8%) 
and neuropathy peripheral (23.0%). This remains coherent with the known safety profile of polatuzumab, 
except for alopecia considered as an additional ADR. 
AEs with an incidence rate ≥10% that were reported in the pooled safety population (all pola + R-CHP/G-
CHP) with a greater difference compared to R-CHOP arm of POLARIX were diarrhoea (33.3% and 20.1%, 
+13.2%),  febrile  neutropenia  (14.8%  and  8.0%,  +6.8%),  nausea  (42.3%  and  36.8%,  +5.5%),  pyrexia 
(16.4% and 12.6%, +3.8%), anemia (28.7% and 26.0%, +2.7%), fatigue (28.7% and 26.5%, +2.2%),

decreased appetite (16.2% and  14.2%, +2.0%), weight decrease (13.8% and 11.9%, +1.9%), asthenia 
(13.0% and 12.1%, +0.9%), vomiting (15.2% and 14.4%, +0.8%), cough (12.8% and 12.1%, +0.7%) 
and neuropathy peripheral (23.0% and 22.6%, +0.4%). 
The  most  frequently  (≥10%)  reported  Grade  3-4  AEs  in  the  pooled  safety  population  were  neutropenia 
(28.5%),  febrile  neutropenia  (14.4%)  and  anemia  (11.0%).  Febrile  neutropenia  and  anemia  were  more 
reported in the pooled safety population than the R-CHOP arm of POLARIX study, i.e. +6.4% and +2.6% 
respectively. 
The MAH provided the treatment-related AEs for the safety population. Overall the submitted analysis of 
treatment-related  AE  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pola  with  no  new  safety  concern 
identified. 
The adverse drug reactions were based on the pooled data from POLARIX in previously untreated DLBCL 
patients treated with Pola+R-CHP and study GO29365 in R/R DLBCL patients treated with pola+BR. Since 
comparable  safety  profile  of  Polivy  was  observed  in  previously  untreated  DLBCL  patients  treated  with 
Pola+R-CHP and in R/R DLBCL patients treated with pola+BR, the approach of ADRs in the pooled safety 
population is considered acceptable. However variability in the ADR frequencies was reported across the 
previously  untreated  DLBCL  patients  treated  by  pola+R-CHP  and  the  R/R  DLBCL  patients  treated  by 
pola+BR such as peripheral neuropathy (52.9% in pola+R-CHP vs 30.5% in pola+BR), neutropenia (38.4% 
in  pola+R-CHP  vs  45.7%  in  pola+BR),  nausea  (41.6%  in  pola+R-CHP  vs  33.1%  in  pola+BR),  diarrhea 
(30.8% in pola+R-CHP and 35.8% in pola+BR). Therefore this ADR frequency variability in the two safety 
populations should be reflected in the section 4.8 of the SmPC, please refer to SmPC comments.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Peripheral neuropathy (PN): In POLARIX, the incidence of PN events was similar in both arms, i.e. 53.9% 
in R-CHOP and 52.9% in Pola+R-CHP. The majority of PN events reported with pola+R-CHP were Grade 1-
2  and  one  serious  PN  occurred  in  each  arm  (0.2%  each),  related  to  the  treatment  in  both  cases.  The 
majority of PN events occurring in POLARIX resolved with a higher rate of PN resolution in R-CHOP arm 
compared  to  pola+R-CHP  arm  (66.9%  and  57.8%  respectively)  which  may  be  partly  explained  by  the 
difference  in  median  time  to  onset  (2.27  months  in  pola+R-CHP  vs  1.87  months  in  R-CHOP)  and  the 
comparable median time to resolution across the two treatment arms. A higher rate of PN leading to any 
study  treatment  discontinuation  and  dose  reduction  was  observed  in  R-CHOP  arm  compared to  pola+R-
CHP arm. Indeed there was a higher proportion of patients that had a vincristine dose reduction due to PN 
in the R-CHOP arm (8.0%) than PN leading to pola dose reduction in the pola+R-CHP arm (3.9%). There 
was a lower incidence of PN in Pola +R-CHP/G-CHP group of the supportive study GO29044 compared to 
the pola+R-CHP arm in POLARIX, i.e. 39.4% and 52.9% respectively. 
Neutropenia  including  febrile  neutropenia:  In  POLARIX,  the  incidence  of  neutropenia  events  was 
comparable in both treatment arms, i.e. 42.7% in R-CHOP and 46.0% in pola+R-CHP. The large majority 
of neutropenia were Grade 3-4 and occurred at similar rates in the two arms (40.2% in R-CHOP, 41.8% in 
pola+R-CHP).  No  Grade  5  events  were  reported.  Neutropenia  leading  to  any  study  treatment 
discontinuation, dose reduction or treatment interruption were also reported at similar rates across the two 
arms. Serious neutropenia were more reported in Pola+R-CHP arm compared to R-CHOP (11.5% vs 8.4%). 
Neutropenia events resolved in most of the cases (98.0% in the pola+R-CHP arm and 97.9% in the R-CHOP 
arm). A higher incidence of neutropenia was observed in study GO29044 compared to POLARIX (51.5%). 
Of note, G-CSF prophylaxis was required in POLARIX during Cycles 1-6 while it was strongly encouraged 
but not mandatory in study GO29044. An overview of AEPI Neutropenia allowing a direct comparison of the 
safety-evaluable  patients  receiving  or  not  G-CSF  prophylaxis  was  provided.  The  occurrence  of  AEPI 
neutropenia was comparable across subjects with and without G-CSF prophylaxis use but the imbalance 
between  the  2  groups  of  subjects  (n=800  in  G-CSF  prophylaxis  use  and  n=73  in  non-prophylaxis  use) 
prevents a clear conclusion on the comparison of neutropenia events by G-CSF status.

Anemia: in POLARIX, the incidence of anemia events was comparable across the 2 treatment arms (26.9% 
in R-CHOP arm and 28.7% in Pola+R-CHP arm). Serious neutropenia were reported at similar rate in both 
arms,  i.e.  1.4%  in  R-CHOP  and  0.9%  in  Pola+R-CHP.  It  is  noted  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  having 
Grade 3-4 neutropenia in Pola-R-CHP compared to R-CHOP (12.0% vs 8.7%) and no Grade 5 anemia in 
POLARIX. The majority of anemia events resolved in both arms, i.e. 84.8% in pola+R-CHP and 86.4% in 
R-CHOP. In study GO29044, the incidence of anemia was comparable to POLARIX (28.8%). The majority 
of anemia events were low grade with 4.5% of Grade 3-4 AEs and no Grade 5 anemia. No serious anemia 
event or anemia leading to treatment modification were observed in the supportive study 
Thrombocytopenia: In POLARIX, the occurrence of thrombocytopenia was similar across pola+R-CHP arm 
and R-CHOP arms, i.e. 13.3% and 13.2% respectively. Grade 3-4 events were reported at comparable rate, 
i.e. 0.5% in pola+R-CHP and 0.2% in R-CHOP respectively, and serious thrombocytopenia occurred in two 
(0.5%)  subjects  in  pola+R-CHP  and  one  (0.2%)  subject  in  R-CHOP.  No  Grade  5  thrombocytopenia  was 
reported in POLARIX. One thrombocytopenia event led to study treatment discontinuation in pola+R-CHP 
arm and none in R-CHOP arm. Median time to onset was however longer in the pola+R-CHP arm compared 
to R-CHOP arm (1.68 months vs 0.41 months) but median time to resolution was similar across the two 
arms (0.36 months in both). More thrombocytopenia resolutions were observed in pola+R-CHP arm than 
R-CHOP arm, i.e. 94.8% and 86.2% respectively. Slightly more thrombocytopenia were reported in study 
GO29044  compared  to  POLARIX,  i.e.  21.2%  of  patients  experienced  one  thrombocytopenia  event.  Also 
more  Grade 3-4  events  were  reported  in  GO29044 than in  POLARIX  (9.1%),  but no  SAE  was  observed. 
Most of the thrombocytopenia events resolved (92.9%). 
Infection: In POLARIX the incidence of infection events, Grade 3-4 infections and serious infections was 
higher in pola+R-CHP arm compared to R-CHOP arm (49.7% vs 42.7%, 14.0% vs 11.2% and 14.0% vs 
10.3%, respectively).  The proportion of Grade 5 infections was comparable in both treatment arms (1.1% 
in pola+R-CHP and 1.4% in R-CHOP); pneumonia was the most reported AE among the Grade 5 Infections 
(4 patients in pola+R-CHP arm, 3 patients in R-CHOP arm) and the other Grade 5 Infection AEs were septic 
choc  and  sepsis.  The  incidence  of  opportunistic  infections  was  higher  in  pola+R-CHP  than  R-CHOP.  The 
majority of infections events resolved (87% in pola+R-CHP and 84.5% in R-CHOP) with a similar median 
time to resolution. Slightly more patients with an infection event were reported in study GO29044 compared 
to POLARIX (53.0%) but Grade 3-5 and serious infections occurred at comparable rates in Pola+R-CHP/G-
CHP in study GO29044 and Pola+R-CHP in POLARIX. 
Hepatic toxicity: hepatotoxicity events were more reported in the pooled safety population (all pola) than 
the R-CHOP arm in POLARIX, i.e. 10.2% and 7.3% respectively, and the majority of reported events were 
low grade. In POLARIX, the incidence of hepatotoxicity, Grade 3 events and serious events was higher in 
Pola+R-CHP arm than R-CHOP arm. The majority of hepatic toxicity reported in the study were ALAT and 
ASAT elevations. There was no Grade 4 or 5 hepatic toxicity event reported nor hepatotoxicity event leading 
to  study  treatment  discontinuation  in  POLARIX.  One  SAE  was  observed  in  pola+R-CHP.  Hepatic  toxicity 
resolved in most of the cases in both arms, i.e. 87.0% in the pola+R-CHP arm and 84.4% in the R-CHOP 
arm. A total of 3 cases of potential DILI were reported in POLARIX: 1 in pola+R-CHP arm and 2 in R-CHOP 
arm. Two cases were confounded by events of sepsis and one was confounded by multiple organ dysfunction 
in  the  setting  of  febrile  neutropenia.  The  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  in  Pola+R-CHP/G-CHP  in  study 
GO29044  was  comparable  to  R-CHOP  arm  in  POLARIX.  All  events  were  low  grade  except  one  Grade  3 
hepatic toxicity.  
Carcinogenicity  /  secondary  malignancies:  Carcinogenicity  has  been  identified  as  an  important 
potential risk with Polivy. Overall, carcinogenicity events were reported at comparable rates across the two 
treatment arms in POLARIX, i.e. 0.9% in pola+R-CHP arm and 1.1% in R-CHOP arm, and no Grade 5 event

was reported. There were more serious events observed in pola+R-CHP arm than R-CHOP arm (3 [0.7%] 
vs 1 [0.2%] cases) but comparable median time to onset (5.86 and 5.06 months respectively). A higher 
proportion of carcinogenicity events resolved in R-CHOP arm compared to pola+R-CHP at the DCO (60% 
vs 25%). 
Pulmonary toxicity: Overall similar incidence of pulmonary toxicity (1.6%) was observed across the two 
treatment arms in POLARIX. The majority of the events were low grade. There was one Grade 3 event in 
pola+R-CHP  arm  and  one  Grade  4  event  in  R-CHOP,  and  no  Grade  5  pulmonary  event  was  reported  in 
POLARIX. Serious pulmonary toxicity events were reported in 2 subjects in R-CHOP arm and one subject in 
pola+R-CHP. One case (1.5%) of pulmonary toxicity was reported in study GO29044 (pola 1.8 mg/kg +R-
CHP/G-CHP) and this event was Grade 2.  
Infusion-related reactions (IRR): Overall the incidence of IRR in POLARIX was comparable across the 
treatment arms (16.0% in R-CHOP arm and 13.3% in pola+R-CHP arm). However the proportion of patients 
experiencing IRR observed in study GO29044 was inconsistent with POLARIX with a very higher IRR rate, 
i.e. 45.5%: this inconsistency in the incidence of IRR between POLARIX and GO29044 studieswas justified 
by the MAH by the IRR AEPI search strategy not aligned across the two studies. Proportion of patients who 
experienced IRRs from pola+R-CHP/G-CHP arms in study GO29044 was comparable with the pola+R-CHP 
arm in POLARIX (13.3% [58/435]) when the search strategy for IRR in GO29044 was aligned with that of 
POLARIX. 
. The majority of IRR reported in the pooled safety population were low grade and no Grade 5 event was 
reported. The large majority of IRR cases resolved.  
Tumor lysis syndrome: In POLARIX, slightly more TLS events were reported in R-CHOP arm compared 
to Pola+R-CHP (4 [0.9%] and 2 [0.5%] patients reported TLS, respectively). Grade 3-4 and serious TLS 
occurred  at  comparable  rate,  and  no  Grade  5  was  reported  in  the  study.  All  cases  of  TLS  reported  in 
POLARIX resolved. There was no case of TLS in study GO29044.  
Cardiac arrhythmia: This AEPI is considered as adverse reaction with clinical consequences, even serious 
but  occurring  with  a  low  frequency  in  the  RMP  but  not  mentioned  in  the  SmPC.  In  POLARIX  cardiac 
arrhythmia  events  were  slightly  more  reported  in  R-CHOP  compared  to  Pola+R-CHP  arm,  i.e.  4.6%  vs 
3.0%. The majority of the reported events were low grade. The proportion of patients who experienced a 
Grade  3-4  cardiac  arrhythmia  event  was  comparable  across  the  two  arms  and  one  Grade  5  cardiac 
arrhythmia was reported in R-CHOP while none in pola+R-CHP. Serious AEs were reported at comparable 
rate in both arms.  
Hyperglycemia: In POLARIX the proportion of patients reporting hyperglycemia was comparable across 
the treatment arms (6.2% in R-CHOP arm and 6.0% in pola+R-CHP arm). The majority of hyperglycemia 
events  were  low  grade.  No  Grade  4,  grade  5,  serious  events  nor  hyperglycemia  leading  to  dose 
discontinuation or reduction were reported in POLARIX. One case of hyperglycemia led to treatment dose 
reduction  in  pola+R-CHP  arm.  The  hyperglycemia  events  in  POLARIX  resolved  in  53.8%  of  the  cases  in 
pola+R-CHP arm and 48.1% in R-CHOP arm.  
Serious adverse event / deaths 
The most common cause of death across the safety population was disease progression. Fatal AEs were 
more reported in the pola+R-CHP arm compared to R-CHOP arm in POLARIX (3.0% vs 2.5%). The most 
frequent Grade 5 AEs in the pooled safety group (all pola) were pneumonia (4 patients [0.8%]) and death 
(4 patients [0.8%]). The treatment-related AEs that led to death in the pola+R-CHP arm were pneumonia 
(3 patients), cardiac death, acute kidney injury and death. In the supportive study GO29044, 2 patients 
had a fatal AE: one case of fatal atrial fibrillation assessed by the investigator as unrelated to any study

drug and related to concurrent illness and one case of fatal septic shock considered related to doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide treatment. Pneumonitis and infections are known risks with polatuzumab. Infections 
and  AV  block  were  also  reported  as  Grade  5  AEs  in  R-CHOP  arm  in  POLARIX,  i.e.  1.4%  and  0.2% 
respectively.   
Overall SAEs were more frequent in the pooled safety population (all pola) than the R-CHOP arm in POLARIX 
study, i.e. 34.9% and 30.6% respectively, driven by the incidence rate of SAEs in Pola + R-CHP/G-CHP 
group  in  study  GO29044  (40.9%).  In  POLARIX,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  one  SAE  in  the 
pola+R-CHP arm was comparable with the R-CHOP arm but more SAEs were treatment-related in pola+R-
CHP than R-CHOP (25.7% and 19.6% respectively). The most common treatment-related SAEs reported 
with  pola+R-CHP/G-CHP  in  both  studies  were  febrile  neutropenia  (10.4%),  neutropenia  (1.6%)  and 
infections (pneumonia [4.6%], sepsis [1.2%], urinary tract infection [1.6%], clostridium difficile infection, 
oral fungal infection, septic shock) and diarrhea (2.4%).The most frequent SAEs with R-CHOP were febrile 
neutropenia (6.4%) and pneumonia (3.9%). 
Laboratory findings 
Overall the Grade 3-4 laboratory findings were comparable across the treatment groups.  
Immunogenicity 
The post-baseline ADAs were reported at a low rate in ADA-evaluable patients treated with pola in POLARIX 
(1.4%, all treatment-induced) and none of them was neutralizing. There were no patients ADA positive at 
post-baseline in the supportive study GO29044. There was no data supporting a potential impact of ADAs 
to pola on safety and efficacy.  
Vital sign, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
In POLARIX, no new signal was detected regarding vital signs and the number of patients with a clinically 
significant ECG abnormality was low and comparable between the treatment arms at screening and post 
baseline. 
Safety in special population 
It is observed that the ≥65 group experienced more events than the <65 group with regard to the Grade 
5  AEs  (4.0%  vs  1.8%),  the  Grade  3-5  AEs  (66.7% vs  55.1%),  the  serious  AEs  (40.2%  vs  28.4%),  AEs 
leading  to  any  study  discontinuation  (4.3%  vs  1.8%),    AEs  leading  to  any  study  treatment  dose 
discontinuation (10.9% vs 2.2%), AEs leading to any study treatment dose reduction (11.6% vs 7.1%) and 
AEs leading to pola/placebo discontinuation (8.3% vs 1.8%). The differences in safety profile between the 
<65 and the ≥65 years patients  are reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
There  was  an  increase  of  the  incidence  of  Grade  3-5  AEs,  SAEs  and  AE  leading  to  dose 
discontinuation/interruption in moderate and severe HI that should be interpreted with caution due to the 
small number of patients; furthermore the SmPC mentioned that the administration of Polivy in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be avoided.  
With regard to the renal function, the proportion of patients who experienced all-grade AEs, Grade ≥ 3 AEs, 
SAEs and AEs leading to any study treatment discontinuation in both treatment arms increased with the 
severity of renal impairment, with very limited data on severe renal impairment (N=2). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  were  more  reported  in  the  pola+R-CHP  arm  than  the  R-CHOP  arm 
from  POLARIX  (3.0%  vs  2.3%).  In  POLARIX  all  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  were  the  reported 
Grade  5  AEs.  In  study  GO29044  only  one  of  the  two  reported  Grade  5  AEs  led  to  study  discontinuation 
(atrial fibrillation). The most reported AEs in the pooled safety population were pneumonia and death.

Overall the rate of AE leading to treatment discontinuation was comparable across the treatment arms in 
POLARIX  (6.2%  in  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  6.6%  in  R-CHOP  arm).  However  the  incidence  rate  in  study 
GO29044  was  higher,  i.e.  12.1%,  with  more  reported  AE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  is  SOCs 
Infections  and  infestations  and  Nervous  system  disorders.  Pneumonia,  pneumonitis,  neutropenia  and 
peripheral neuropathy were the most reported AEs leading to any treatment discontinuation in the pooled 
safety population.  
AEs leading to dose reduction occurred more frequently in R-CHOP arm from POLARIX than all pola pooled 
safety  population,  i.e.  13.0%  and  9.6%,  mostly  driven  by  the  rate  of  AEs  leading  to  vincristine  dose 
reduction (10.3%) in R-CHOP arm which is higher than that leading to a pola dose reduction (5.8%) in the 
pooled  population.  The  majority  of  AE  leading  to  dose  reduction  in  the  pooled  safety  population  were 
Nervous system disorders SOC. 
In POLARIX, the incidence of AEs leading to interruption of any study treatment in the pola+R-CHP arm 
(23.7%) was comparable to the R-CHOP arm (25.3%). Infections and infestations were the most reported 
AEs leading to interruption of any study treatment in pola+R-CHP arm while it was Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders in R-CHOP arm.  
Post-marketing experience 
No new or unexpected safety findings have been identified in the post-marketing setting. The regimen of 
pola in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) administered 
in the POLARIX study is not yet approved. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  no  new  safety  concern  arises  from  the  safety  data  from  polatuzumab  vedotin  1.8  mg/kg  in 
combination  with  R-CHP  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  DLBCL.  The  safety  profile  remained  not 
negligible with a high incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs (mainly myelosuppression and infections) to 
consider in the context of a life-threatening condition.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The updated CSR from study Polarix; A Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP 
versus  in previously untreated patients with DLBCL aimed to study long term safety, will be submitted as 
category 3 measure (see RMP).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
DLBCL is the most common histologic subtype of NHL, accounting for 30% of NHL cases (Armitage and 
Weisenburger 1998) and 80% of aggressive lymphomas. In 2020, 544,352 new NHL cases worldwide 
were estimated with over 163,000 patients estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL (Global Cancer 
Observatory 2020). While DLBCL is mostly frequently diagnosed between ages of 65 and 74 years (with 
median age of 65 years at diagnosis [SEER]), it can also occur in the younger population, including 
children and young adults. Initially, DLBCL may be asymptomatic, but it may also be associated with 
constitutional symptoms such as fever, recurrent night sweats, weight loss, and/or local effects of lymph 
node enlargement, as well as those of bone marrow failure. Without treatment, DLBCL is fatal with a 
median survival of approximately 6 months (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care therapy for DLBCL involves frontline multi-agent chemotherapy with complementary 
mechanisms of action combined with immunotherapy. Up to 8 cycles of R-CHOP given in 21-day intervals 
(R-CHOP-21), or R-CHOP-like chemotherapy is considered to be the standard of care therapy for patients 
with previously untreated DLBCL. Although the biologic features of DLBCL are evaluated in clinical 
practice and clinical research, they do not clearly guide the choice of therapy, as no definitive studies 
have demonstrated superiority to R-CHOP in biomarker-selected populations. The fact that most patients 
who are not cured by R-CHOP or comparable immunochemotherapy will eventually die of lymphoma 
underscores the need for novel 
approaches in upfront and subsequent lines of therapy for this aggressive disease. 
There is therefore a high unmet medical need in the 1L setting and a strong rationale for introducing 
novel therapeutic agents that can build upon R-CHOP and improve outcomes in patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL by preventing or delaying relapse. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study provided by the MAH in this application is a phase III pivotal study (Study GO39942: 
POLARIX) which is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy 
and  safety  of  polatuzumab  vedotin  in  combination  with  R-CHP  versus  R-CHOP  in  previously  untreated 
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  
A  total  of  879  patients  were  included  (ITT  population)  in  the  pivotal  phase  III,  comparative  randomized 
POLARIX  study,  440  in  pola+R-CHP  arm  and  439  in  R-CHOP  arm.  Patients  received  six  cycles  of  either 
pola+R-CHP  (and  vincristine  placebo)  or  standard  R-CHOP  chemotherapy  (and  polatuzumab  vedotin 
placebo) at 21-day intervals. Both arms then received two additional cycles of single agent rituximab. This 
design is acceptable as R-CHOP remains the standard of care therapy in previously untreated DLBCL. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/287823/2022 
Page 167/174 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
polatuzumab vedotin dose of 1.8 mg/kg given every 21 days in combination with R/G-CHP for 6 or 8 cycles 
was determined in the dose-finding study (Study GO29044). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable 
and  are  in  accordance  with  the  claimed  indication.  Treatment  arms  were  generally  well-balanced  with 
respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. For both regimens, treatment exposure remained high. 
Approximately 90% of patients in each treatment arm received 6 cycles of CHP treatment.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  Investigator-assessed  PFS  is  observed 
following treatment with pola+R-CHP compared to R-CHOP. A reduction in the risk of progression/relapse 
or death by 27% is observed in patients treated in pola+R-CHP arm (stratified HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57, 
0.95]; two-sided log-rank p-value=0.0177, two-sided α=0.05) with a minimum of 24 months from study 
enrollment  in  both  arms.  Results  of  all  sensitivity  analyses  were  consistent  with  results  of  the  primary 
analysis of Investigator-assessed PFS in the ITT population. 
Results of the primary endpoint are also supported by the EFSeff secondary endpoint. A significant 
reduction in the risk of occurrence of disease by 25% was observed in patients treated in pola+R-CHP 
arm compared in patients treated in R-CHOP arm (stratified HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.96]). Also, the 
BICR-assessed CR rate was high (78.0% [95%CI: 73.79, 81.74] vs. 74.0% [95% CI: 69.66, 78.07]). In 
addition, concordance between BICR and Investigator assessments of CR was high (88.7%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A total of 53 deaths (12.0% patients) were reported in the pola+R-CHP arm, and 57 deaths (13.0% 
patients) were reported in the R-CHOP arm. With very few events in both arms, OS results were still 
immature at the time of the interim analysis of OS and did not meet the pre-specified threshold for 
statistical significance (stratified HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.65, 1.37])”. Final OS data are expected in order to 
further document long term efficacy and safety provided by a pola+R-CHP regimen compared to a R-
CHOP regimen in this population. Indeed, the OS results provided in this report come from the interim OS 
analysis performed at the time of the PFS analysis. Therefore, the MAH will provide an update of the CSR 
of study Polarix containing the final OS results by Q4 2022 as a post approval measure (see RMP) which 
is acceptable. 
The CHMP requested data from an additional China extension cohort of Study GO39942 (POLARIX) that 
are analyzed within an Asia subpopulation analysis and are reported in an Asia subpopulation CSR that 
includes all Chinese patients enrolled in the China extension and in the main global study. For this 
purpose, the MAH has requested approval for providing and opening access to Chinese Human Genetic 
Resources abroad from the Human Genetics Resources Administration of China (HGRAC) and would be 
able to provide the data from China extension cohort, in the form of Asia subpopulation CSR, if granted 
by HGRAC. For the time being access is not granted and the data may be submitted later – as 
recommended by the CHMP - when available.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Myelosupression was reported across all studies. Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, anemia and 
thrombocytopenia were all included in the AEs of particular interest. In the pivotal study, the incidence of 
neutropenia events was comparable in both treatment arms, i.e. 42.7% in R-CHOP and 46.0% in pola+R-
CHP but higher serious neutropenia events were reported in the pola+R-CHP arm compared to the R-
CHOP arm (11.5% vs 8.4%), mainly due to a higher incidence of serious febrile neutropenia in the 
pola+R-CHP arm (9.9%). The incidence of anemia events was comparable across the 2 treatment arms in 
POLARIX (26.9% in R-CHOP arm and 28.7% in Pola+R-CHP arm) but Grade 3-4 events were more 
reported with pola+R-CHP than R-CHOP (12.0% vs 8.7%). Incidence of thrombocytopenia was similar 
across pola+R-CHP arm and R-CHOP arms, i.e. 13.3% and 13.2% respectively. The majority of 
myelosuppression events resolved. 
Infections are expected with polatuzumab vedotin. In the pivotal study, the incidence of infectious events, 
Grade 3-4 infections and serious infections was higher in pola+R-CHP arm compared to R-CHOP arm 
(49.7% vs 42.7%, 14.0% vs 11.2% and 14.0% vs 10.3%, respectively). Most of the fatal AEs in both 
arms were due to infections or complications of infection. The proportion of Grade 5 infections was 
comparable in both treatment arms (1.1% in pola+R-CHP and 1.4% in R-CHOP). Pneumonia was the 
most reported AE among the Grade 5 Infections (4 patients in pola+R-CHP arm, 3 patients in R-CHOP 
arm) and the other Grade 5 Infection AEs were septic shock and sepsis. The incidence of opportunistic 
infections was higher in pola+R-CHP than R-CHOP. 
Peripheral neuropathy was reported across all studies. In the pivotal study, PN events occurred at 
comparable incidence in both treatment arms (53.9% in R-CHOP and 52.9% in Pola+R-CHP) and the 
majority of PN was low grade. None was fatal and 2 cases of PN were serious (one in each arm). The 
majority of PN events occurring in POLARIX resolved with a higher rate in R-CHOP arm compared to 
pola+R-CHP arm (66.9% and 57.8% respectively) which may be partly explained by the difference in 
median time to onset (2.27 months in pola+R-CHP vs 1.87 months in R-CHOP) and the comparable 
median time to resolution across the two treatment arms. The most commonly reported PN events were 
neuropathy peripheral (24.1% and 22.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (19.5% and 21.5%), 
paraesthesia (6.7% and 4.6%), hypoaesthesia (3.7% and 3.2%), polyneuropathy (1.4% and 2.5%), and 
peripheral motor neuropathy (0.7% and 2.3%) in the pola+R-CHP and R-CHOP arms, respectively.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of the pivotal  phase III,  comparative,  POLARIX study  defined  as  PFS  was 
achieved. A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of Investigator-assessed PFS is 
observed following treatment with pola+R-CHP compared to R-CHOP, the 1L DLCBL standard of treatment. 
One  could  question  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  as  only  a  difference  of  27  events  is  observed 
between both arms of treatment. This slight improvement of PFS is supported by sensitivity analyses and 
secondary endpoints. The use of polatuzumab vedotin instead of vincristine did not lead to improvement in 
treatment-related symptoms and peripheral neuropathy in POLARIX study. The CHMP considers interim OS 
results are still immature and could be considered as not sufficiently robust.  However, OS interim results 
do not indicate detrimental effect of polatuzumab vedotin.  
The pivotal POLARIX study met its primary endpoint PFS and no large differences in safety risks, have been 
found. In this clinical situation, the presented median follow-up time is considered sufficient, and maturity 
of  data  is  not  relevant  as  a  cure  rate  of  60%  is  anticipated  in  the  control  arm.  No  detriment  in  OS  of 
polatuzumab vedotin is to be anticipated considering the results in combination with follow-up exceeding 
the time period in which most of the relapses would have occurred (i.e. 24 months).  
The  safety  profile  of  pola+R-CHP  does  not  raise  new  safety  concern  compared  to  pola+BR.    Therefore, 
efficacy and safety data provided from untreated patient could be considered as confirmatory safety and 
efficacy data for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory DLCBL.   
The PFS gain, as primary endpoint in the pivotal study, and no detriment in OS is sufficient to establish 
clinical benefit of polatuzumab vedotin as a substitute for vincristine in the combination regimen.    
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of benefits and risks of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL is positive 
provided changes in SmPC and additional post-approval measures.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Per current Polivy SmPC Annex II.E, provision of efficacy and safety data by Q4 2021 is the last remaining 
specific  obligation  (SOB-CLIN-003)  to  the  CMA  of  Polivy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  DLBCL  who  are  not  candidates  for  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant.  The  pivotal 
POLARIX  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  PFS  and  no  large  differences  in  safety  risks,  have  been  found. 
Therefore, efficacy and safety data provided from untreated patient could be considered as confirmatory 
safety and efficacy data for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory DLCBL. With the submission of 
this Type II variation, all specific obligations related to the CMA are fulfilled. As a result, the CHMP agreed 
on  a  full  marketing  authorisation  in  accordance  with  Article  14(1)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
(marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations).

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone,  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously  untreated  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma 
(DLBCL) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of the indication to include: Polivy in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on the efficacy and safety data from the Pivotal Phase III 
Study GO39942 (POLARIX). Annexes I, II, IIIB are revised. The RMP is also updated.  This submission 
fulfills SOB003 thus supporting the switch from CMA to full MA. 
In addition, the CHMP, having considered the application as set out in the appended assessment report 
and having reviewed the data submitted by the marketing authorisation holder including the evidence 
concerning compliance with specific obligations, is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance of the 
above mentioned medicinal product remains favourable, that all specific obligations laid down in Annex II 
have been fulfilled and that comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-risk balance of the above 
mentioned medicinal product. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the 
CHMP recommends by consensus the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 
14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for the above mentioned medicinal product for which the draft 
Summary of Product Characteristics is set out in Annex I. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Polivy is not similar to Minjuvi, Yescarta or Kymriah within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix X>

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
08 April 2022. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA website 
at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by 08 April 2022. We would like to remind you that, according to Article 
4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal data’ 
means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online 
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.” 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

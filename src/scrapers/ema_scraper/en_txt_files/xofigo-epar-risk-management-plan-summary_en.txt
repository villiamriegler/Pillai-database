Summary of risk management plan for Xofigo® (Radium-223 dichloride) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Xofigo®. The RMP details 
important risks of Xofigo®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Xofigo®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Xofigo®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Xofigo® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Xofigo® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Xofigo®'s RMP. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
I. 
Xofigo® ,as monotherapy or in combination with luteinising hormone releasing hormone 
(LHRH) analogue, is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral 
metastases, in progression after at least two prior lines of systemic therapy for mCRPC (other 
than LHRH analogues), or ineligible for any available systemic mCRPC treatment (see SmPC 
for the full indication). It contains Radium-223 dichloride as the active substance and it is 
administered by intravenous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Xofigo®’s benefits can be found in Xofigo®’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage found on the following link: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xofigo. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Xofigo®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Xofigo®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PBRER/PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Xofigo® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of important risks and missing information 
II.A 
Important risks of Xofigo® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Xofigo®. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Section 4 (Possible side effects) 
SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and PL section 2: 
Xofigo® is contraindicated in combination with abiraterone and 
predniso(lo)ne. 
The combination of Xofigo® with other systemic cancer therapies 
other than LHRH analogues is not recommended. 
Physicians are advised to carefully assess bone status and baseline 
risk of fractures in patients prior to initiating the therapy. Patients 
should be closely monitored for at least 24 months. 
Administration of bone protective agents is recommended as a 
preventive measure before starting or resuming treatment with 
Xofigo®. 
In patients with a high baseline risk of fracture, the benefit of 
treatment should be carefully assessed to outweigh the risk. 
Sufficient treatment wash-out period is recommended before and/or 
after treatment with Xofigo® and other cancer therapies. 
In patients with bone fractures, orthopaedic stabilisation of fractures 
should be performed before starting or resuming treatment with 
Xofigo®. 
Patients are instructed to inform their healthcare practitioner if they 
have osteoporosis or a known increased risk for fractures. 
Patients are instructed to inform their healthcare practitioner if they 
taking any systemic cancer therapies and/or second generation 
androgen receptors antagonists.

labelmulticentre study according to an agreed protocol in order to further characterise the 
efficacy and safety, in particular the risk of fractures with Radium-223 dichloride in the 
authorised indication. 
The protocol should foresee a stratified randomisation of patients according to total ALP 
levels. 
This study will specifically address the important identified risk of bone fractures. The study 
also includes bone biomarker assessments (markers of bone formation and bone resorption) in 
the control arm. 
20511 – Phase I biodistribution study 
Study short name and title: 
Phase I biodistribution study. 
 
 
Purpose of the study: 
The MAH was required to conduct and submit the results of a phase I biodistribution study 
according to an agreed protocol in order to further characterise correlation between the extent 
of the disease, the dose and the distribution of Radium-223 dichloride in bone metastases 
versus sites of impaired bone health (e.g., osteoporosis) versus normal bone structure.

Purpose of the study: 
The REASSURE study is to evaluate the short and long-term safety profile of Radium-223 
dichloride and will assess the safety and tolerability of Radium-223 dichloride and the risk of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hodgkin  lymphoma  (HL)  is  a  lymphoid  malignancy  characterised  by  the  presence  of  multinucleated 
Reed-Sternberg cells, which usually account for only 1% to 10% of the cells in the tumour tissue. The majority 
of cells in HL tumour tissue are a mixed infiltrate of various lymphoid cells, including effector and regulatory 
T-cells  and  macrophage.    The  updated  2008  WHO  classification  recognizes  2  histologic  groups:  nodular 
lymphocyte predominant, which accounts for about 5% of all HL cases and classical HL (cHL) which accounts for 
the remaining 95%.  
From a histological point of view, cHL is characterised by the presence of the pathognomonic Reed-Sternberg 
(RS) cells in the context of a mixed inflammatory background, which comprises lymphocytes (T-cells are usually 
predominant), eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, plasma cells and fibroblasts. The specific inflammatory 
pattern,  particularly  the  number  of  infiltrating  macrophages  and  eosinophils,  has  prognostic  value.  In  fact, 
based on the histological pattern, cHL is further classified into 4 distinct subtypes: nodular sclerosis (70%), 
mixed  cellularity  (20-25%),  lymphocyte  rich  (5%)  and  lymphocyte  depleted  (<1%).  The  rare  lymphocyte 
depleted variant is associated with the most aggressive behaviour and worst prognosis. 
There are marked geographic epidemiologic differences in HL with highly variable incidence rates due to age, 
ethnicity, region, prior infections and other factors. The incidence in Europe is approximately 2.4 cases per 
100.000 persons, and presents a characteristic bimodal age distribution curve, with one peak in young adults 
(median age of onset 20 years) and one in older adults (median age of onset 65 years). Overall, the majority of 
patients are young adults, with a slightly higher prevalence in males. cHL accounts for approximately 10% of all 
lymphomas and 0.6% of all cancers.  
Treatment of cHL is primarily based on disease stage and the presence or absence of certain clinical features 
(i.e. B symptoms and bulky disease). Localised, early stage cHL is usually treated with a combination of 
abbreviated chemotherapy and low dose involved-site radiation therapy: cure rates with this approach are 
significantly high, approximating 90% in some studies.  Advanced cHL is usually treated with upfront 
combination chemotherapy (e.g. ABVD, BEACOPP or STANFORD-V) ± involved-field radiation therapy 
(especially in presence of bulky disease and residual mass). Most patients with cHL will attain an initial 
remission, however relapse/refractoriness rates are known to range from 10 to 20% in early stages to 30-40% 
(according to treatment and baseline characteristics) in more advanced settings. For patients who relapse, 
treatment of choice consists of a chemotherapy regimen (different than that used in the first line) followed by 
high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. After the initial 
multi-drug treatment regimen, approximately 5% to 10% of patients with HL suffer from primary refractory 
disease, defined as no response or progression within 90 days of treatment, and an additional 10 to 30% will 
relapse. In this population, an additional 10% to 30% will relapse. Once a subject undergoes ASCT and 
subsequently relapses, the outcomes are generally poor and efficacious therapeutic options are limited. The 
median OS of patients who relapse after ASCT was initially reported to be < 1 year; more recent data suggests 
that the median OS is evolving and may be closer to 2 years because of the availability of newer therapies like 
brentuximab vendotin.  
Salvage therapy is currently based on the use of non-cross-resistant regimens (i.e. DHAP, IGeV, GemOX plus 
dexamethasone,  ICE  etc.)  and  can  achieve  responses  in  approximately  50%  of  patients.  Unfortunately,

long-term  disease  control  following  conventional  therapy  alone  is  uncommon,  and  further  consolidation  is 
needed. Fit patients are candidates for high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT). The German Hodgkin's Lymphoma Study Group (GHSG) has identified three adverse 
risk factors predictive of second relapse following salvage therapy (including ASCT): time to first recurrence ≤12 
months, stage III or IV at first relapse and haemoglobin <10.5 (females) or <12.0 (males) g/dL at the time of 
first relapse (Josting A et al, JCO 2002). The long-term prognosis of patients not eligible ASCT, or who have 
failed ASCT, is poor: three-year survival rate is 31% overall (Böll B et al, JCO 2013). 
Brentuximab vedotin (BV), an immunotoxin comprised of a CD30-directed antibody linked to an anti-tubulin 
agent (MMAE), is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) cHL 
following  ASCT  or  at  least  two  prior  therapies  when  ASCT  or  multi-agent  chemotherapy  is  not  a  treatment 
option, or as a “consolidation” for the treatment of adult patients at increased risk of relapse or progression 
following ASCT. In a phase II trial in which 102 patients with relapsed or refractory HL after prior autologous HCT 
were treated with brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg every three weeks for up to 16 cycles) the overall response 
rate  (ORR)  was  75%  (34%  CR).  Five  years  OS  was  41%  (65%  for  patients  who  obtained  a  CR)  and 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 22% (52% for patients in CR).  Treatment with BV is not devoid of toxicities, 
with peripheral sensory neuropathy (42%) being the most common non-hematologic adverse event (AE). BV 
also proved to be an effective “bridge” to transplant (Chen R et al, Blood 2016; Younes A et al, JCO 2012). 
Prognosis after failure of BV is poor. A selected subset of patients might be eligible to allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem  cell  transplant  (allo-HSCT),  which  might  still  result  in  long-term  remission  in  a  subset  of  fit  patients. 
However, transplant-related mortality and toxicity is not negligible. Other treatment options (i.e. lenalidomide, 
bortezomib etc.) should still be considered experimental and are not usually associated with long-term clinical 
benefit. 
Programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, frequently responsible of cancer cell evasion of immune 
surveillance, have been shown to be over-expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells, making PD-1 an attractive target 
in r/r cHL. In this regard, check-point inhibitors such pembrolizumab, directly acting on the PD-1 blockade, 
might prove effective in this heavily pre-treated population. Opdivo (nivolumab), a human IgG4 anti-PD-1 
monoclonal antibody, has been recently granted an indication for the treatment of adult patients with r/r cHL 
after ASCT and treatment with BV.  
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody blocking the interaction between the 
programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PDL2. As a consequence, the functional activity 
of the target lymphocytes is enhanced to facilitate immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. An EU  Marketing 
Authorization (MA) was granted on 17 July 2015 as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable 
or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
In this application it is proposed for the treatment of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) in adults who have 
refractory disease, or who have relapsed after greater than or equal to 3 prior lines of therapy. 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in cHL is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the 
“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment and as such a 
justification is provided for not submitting an Environmental Risk Assessment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Table 1. Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology results specific to rrcHL indication derive from two clinical studies (KEYNOTE-013 and 
KEYNOTE-087)  and  are  supported  by  available  data  from  other  indications  previously  approved  with 
pembrolizumab. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
A  pooled  population  PK  analysis  using  data  from  the  KN001,  KN002  and  KN006  studies  was  performed  to 
characterize serum pembrolizumab concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects across 
the melanoma and NSCLC indications has been discussed in previous applications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 10/102 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In support of this specific submission, a focused PK analysis was conducted primarily to show the similarity of 
observed concentrations in subjects with rrcHL cancer in KN013 (10 mg/kg Q2W) and KN087 (200 mg Q3W) 
with the predictions from the definitive population PK analysis. The definitive population PK model was adequate 
to describe the PK data in subjects with rrcHL (see section on PK/PD Modelling). 
Pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab in HL as compared to other tumour indications 
The similarity of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in HL as compared to other tumour indications (melanoma 
and NSCLC) was assessed in the Population Pharmacokinetic Model for Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to Subjects 
with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) report. 
Previously,  a  pooled  population  PK  analysis  (report  04DDV3)  using  KN001,  KN002  and  KN006  studies  was 
performed to characterize serum concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects across 
the  melanoma  and  NSCLC  indications.  This  analysis  is  considered  the  definitive  population  PK  analysis  to 
characterize pembrolizumab PK and inform the label for pembrolizumab.  
The structure of the definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab has a two-compartment model structure 
with  a  linear  clearance  from  the  central  compartment,  parameterized  in  terms  of  clearance  (CL), 
inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q),  central  compartment  volume  of  distribution  (Vc),  and  peripheral 
compartment volume of distribution (Vp). All PK parameters were allometrically scaled based on body weight 
with separate exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters, as follows:  
where  θx  is  a  typical  value  of  a  pharmacokinetic  parameter  P*,  and  θy  is  the  fixed-effect  parameter  to  be 
estimated.  WT  is  the  individual  body  weight,  and  MedianWT  is  the  median  body  weight  across  the  analysis 
population.  
In addition to body weight, the existing population PK model contained several more covariate relationships, 
which  were  established  through  a  stepwise  covariate  search.  The  covariate  relationships  used  the  following 
generic form for continuous covariates, similar to the relationships for body weight. 
=*

The following function was used to describe the effects of categorical covariates: 
Where  θx  is  a  typical  value  of  a  pharmacokinetic  parameter  P*,  and  θy  is  the  fixed-effect  parameter  to  be 
estimated, and Cov is the (continuous) covariate value and Q is the indicator variable denoting the category of 
the (categorical) covariate. 
Inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  of  the  PK  parameters  (CL,  Volume  of  distributions  (Vc  and  Vp)  and 
inter-compartmental clearance Q) was included using a lognormal random effects model. 
Residual  variability  (RV),  a  composite  measure  of  assay  error,  dose/sample  time  collection  errors,  model 
misspecification, and any other unexplained variability within a subject, was modeled using a log-transformed

additive error model. (for the Assessment of the population PK analysis, please refer to the variation II/11 of 
Keytruda).  
No additional model development was performed in the current analysis, and the definitive population PK was 
used as is. For this updated PK evaluation, the data from HL patients from studies KN013 and KN087 were added 
to  the  dataset.  Therefore,  the  consistency  of  pembrolizumab  PK  in  patients  with  Hodgkin  Lymphoma  from 
studies KN013 and KN087 with the established definitive population PK analysis was analyzed. Furthermore, 
comparisons were made of observed peak and trough concentrations between Japanese and non-Japanese HL 
patients. 
The final analysis data set from studies KN001, KN002, KN006, KN013 and KN087 used for the population PK 
based comparisons comprised of a total of 13771 pembrolizumab concentrations from 2417 patients.  
The figures below report the Pembrolizumab serum concentrations for the HL subjects treated with 200 mg Q3W 
or 10 mg/kg Q2W, together with a predicted concentration range (median and 90% prediction interval) from the 
definitive population PK model, based on the data from patients with melanoma or NSCLC.  
Near steady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were achieved by 18 weeks; the median Cmin at 18 weeks 
was approximately 28 mcg/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. The median area under the 
concentration-time curve at steady state over 3 weeks (AUC0-3weeks) was 658 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg 
every 3  weeks and 876 mcg∙day/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.

To further establish the similarity in pembrolizumab exposures across indications, several comparisons have 
been made of peak and trough concentrations between indications.

Figures 3- 4: Observed peak and trough concentrations in HL vs predicted in melanoma and NSCLC  
The observed median steady-state trough concentrations (Cmin) in cHL is up to 40% higher than that in other 
tumour types; however, the range of trough concentrations are similar. There are no notable differences in 
median peak concentrations (Cmax) between cHL and other tumour types. As a further comparison, distributions 
of  observed  peak  and  trough  concentrations  for  the  different  dose  regimens  and  indications  have  been 
compared.

The plot includes additional concentration data at 200 mg Q3W from patients with NSCLC (KN024) and HNSCC 
(KN055).  
The figure below summarizes the distributions of observed peak and trough concentrations of pembrolizumab in 
Japanese  and  non-Japanese  HL  patients  at  200  mg  Q3W  from  study  KN087,  both  following  the  first 
administration (Cycle 1) and at Cycle 8, which represents steady state.  
Overall, the peak and trough concentrations in Japanese HL patients are well contained in the distribution of 
observed  concentrations  in  non-Japanese  patients,  indicating  similarity  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
pembrolizumab across both populations.

2.3.3.   Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction 
with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown 
to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, including 
anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity

KN010, KN012, KN013, KN024, KN052, KN055, KN087 and KN164. 
In  the  immunogenicity  assessment,  3268  subjects  were  included  (1535  Melanoma  subjects,  1237  NSCLC 
subjects,  101  HNSCC  subjects,  121  UC  subjects,  54  MSI-H  subjects  and  220  HL  subjects).  The  overall 
immunogenicity incidence was defined as the proportion of treatment emergent positive subjects to the total 
number  of  evaluable  subjects  (treatment  emergent  positive,  non-treatment  emergent  positive  and  negative 
immunogenicity status). 
The  samples  were  assayed 
for  anti-pembrolizumab  antibodies  presence,  using  a  validated 
electrochemiluminescense (ECL) immunoassay. Bioanalysis of pembrolizumab ADA was carried out using the 
standard 3-tiered assay approach that consisted of screening (Tier 1), confirmation (Tier 2) and antibody titer 
assessment (Tier 3). Only Tier 2 confirmed ADA positive samples moved to Tier 3 and were reported with a titer 
value. Tier 2 confirmed ADA positive samples were also assessed using a nAb assay based on the ability of ADA 
to block (neutralize) the critical first step in the pharmacological action of pembrolizumab, which is binding to 
PD-1,  its  in  vivo  target.  Finally,  Protein  G  depletion  was  used  to  confirm  the  presence  pembrolizumab 
neutralizing antibodies. 
A summary of subject immunogenicity results is reported below:

During the course of the study, measurement of the ADA samples was transferred from Intertek to another 
Vendor (PPD). 
As part of the assay transfer, the ADA screening assay was further optimized to increase the DTL. Part of the 
samples was analyzed at Intertek, and part of the samples was analyzed at PPD. All the samples were analyzed 
using the same type of assay. For the evaluation of each individual ADA sample, the DTL of the corresponding 
assay  has  been  used.  The  DTL  for  the  ADA  assay  executed  at  Intertek  is  25  μg/mL,  the  DTL  for  the  ADA 
screening assay executed at PPD is 124 μg/mL. 
In  the  current  database,  all  samples  were  tested  in  the  ADA  screening  assay,8019  samples  were  tested  at 
Intertek (KN001, KN002, KN006, KN010, and KN012), and 6520 samples were tested at PPD (KN001, KN006, 
KN010, KN012, KN013, KN024, KN052, KN055, KN087 and KN164). 
Evaluation of drug tolerance level 
The immunogenicity status of a subject could only be conclusively confirmed to be negative if all pre-treatment 
and post-dose samples were negative in the confirmatory assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab and if the 
concentration of pembrolizumab in the last post-dose sample was below the drug tolerance level. 
At  the  recommended  dosing  regimen  of  200  mg  fixed  dose,  the  pembrolizumab  concentration  in  the  last 
post-dose sample was below the drug tolerance level for about 95% of the subjects. 
At the recommended dosing regimen of 200 mg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose sample 
was  below  the  drug  tolerance  level  (<DTL)  for  about  95%  of  the  subjects  (n=0  last  post  dose  sample  with 
concentration >DLT), indicating that the DLT for the ADA assay is adequate  for 200 mg.

Considering the pooled analysis stratified by treatment and indication, 1 subjects out of 220 assessable subjects 
(0.5%) with HL had treatment emergent ADA. Overall, in all assessable subjects including 3268 subjects, the 
incidence  rate  for treatment  emergent  ADA  was  1.8%,  (29  out  of  1619)  similar  to  those observed  with  the 
previous immunogenicity database (2.0% TE ADA). 
The  results  of  the  neutralizing  assay  of  the  confirmed  positive  ADA  samples  were  provided.  The  submitted 
summary report includes the immunogenicity assessment of 3727 subjects (1535 melanoma, 1238 NSCLC, 101 
HNSS, 54 MSI-H, 220 HL and 579 UC subjects). Out of them, 2034 subjects were evaluable, with 1.8% (36 out 
of 2034) incidence of treatment emergent ADA, based on a pooled analysis (melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, MSI-H, 
HL and UC). Nine of the 36 treatment emergent positive subjects (1 melanoma, 5 NSCLC, 1 HL and 2 UC) tested 
positive  in  the  neutralizing  assay  and  thus  were  considered  as  ‘treatment  emergent  neutralizing  positive’, 
accounting  for a total incidence rate of treatment emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0.4% (9 out of 
2034)  in  the  overall  population.  No  impact  of  binding  or  neutralizing  ADA  on  pembrolizumab  exposure  was 
observed. 
Exposure-Response analysis 
An ER analysis  was performed  to explore the relationship between pembrolizumab dose and the anti-tumour 
response measured as the change from baseline of the sum of the area of index lesions in subjects with rrcHL 
The dataset for this analysis include 31 subjects from KN013 (10 mg/kg Q2W) and 210 subjects from KN087 
(200 mg Q3W).  
Table 3: number of patients with available PK data: 
A flat dose-response relationship for change in tumour size in pembrolizumab treated rrcHL subjects was 
demonstrated from studies KN013 and KN087.

Figure 7:  Box-and-whisker plots of tumour size change, stratified by dose: 
rrcHL subjects who received 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN013) exhibited similar tumour size reduction as those dosed 200 
mg Q3W (KN087), demonstrating a flat dose-response relationship as already shown in other indications. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The updated clinical pharmacology results new in this submission include: PK data from KEYNOTE-013 (KN013) 
and KEYNOTE-087 (KN087), an integrated review of the available data to evaluate the appropriateness of the 
200 mg Q3W dose for the rrcHL indication based on the response data from KN013 (10 mg/kg Q2W) and KN087 
(200 mg Q3W) and other previously submitted data and an updated evaluation of immunogenicity including 
data from KN013 and KN087. 
The starting point for the population PK analysis submitted in the current variation application was a previous 
population PK analysis based on dataset including 2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications 
(KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies). This former analysis is considered the definitive population PK model to 
inform the label for pembrolizumab and no further model development was performed in the current analysis 
which incorporates data from HL patients recruited in studies KN013 and KN087. Thus, the final dataset consist 
of a total of 13771 determinations of pembrolizumab concentrations from 2417 patients.  
The  approach  taken  was  to  utilize  the  definitve  population  PK  model  to  predict  pembrolizumab  levels  in  HL 
patients  after  200  mg  Q3W  and  10  mg/kg  Q2W.  The  predictions  were  compared  with  observed  levels 
determined in studies KN087 and KN013. 
Plasma  drug  trough  concentrations  in  cycle  1  observed  at  200  mg  Q3W  in  HL  patients  are  slightly  higher 
compared to the range of concentrations at dose levels of 2 mg/kg Q3W and of 200 mg Q3W in MEL and NSCLC

patients. Descriptive statistics of all later PK sampling time points and a comprehensive PK evaluation at steady 
state from both studies KN087 and KN013 were provided. With the 200 mg Q3W regimen, very few simulated 
patients >100 kg fall below the 5th percentile of exposures from the 2 mg/kg Q3W regimen. Therefore, the 200 
mg is a conservative fixed dose that maintains exposures between the established clinical bounds of 2 and 10 
mg/kg for the overwhelming majority of subjects, even those >100 kg.  
The observed median steady-state trough concentrations (Cmin) in cHL is up to 40% higher than that in other 
tumour types; however, the range of trough concentrations are similar. There are no notable differences in 
median peak concentrations (Cmax) between cHL and other tumour types. However, based on available safety 
data in cHL and other tumour types, (see discussion on clinical safety)  these differences are not clinically 
meaningful. Information on the observed median steady state levels in HL patients from Keynote -013 and -087 
and on possible PK differences to melanoma /NSCLC is adequately described in section 5.2 of the SmPC.   
The relationship between body weight and clearance supports the use of either fixed dose or body weight-based 
dosing to provide adequate and similar control of exposure. 
Overall,  the  model  proved  adequate  to  capture  pembrolizumab  concentration  indicating  that  the  definitive 
population PK model provides an adequate representation of the pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in HL, in 
addition to melanoma and NSCLC. The PK report and the evaluation of studies KN087 and KN013 presented by 
the MAH includes descriptive statistics for Cmin and Cmax from cycle 1 of both studies only.  
The  MAH  performed  an  ER  analysis  to  explore  the  relationship  between  pembrolizumab  dose  and  the 
anti-tumour response measured as the change from baseline of the sum of the area of index lesions in subjects 
with rrcHL. A flat dose-response relationship for change in tumour size in pembrolizumab treated rrcHL subjects 
was demonstrated from studies KN013 and KN087. 
In  all  3268  subjects  assessed,  the  incidence  rate  for  treatment  emergent  ADA was  1.8%,  (29  out  of  1619) 
similar to that observed with the previous immunogenicity database (2.0% TE ADA). 
Out of the 2034 subjects across indications who were evaluable for immunogevicity assessment, 1.8% (36 out 
of 2034) incidence of treatment emergent ADA, based on a pooled analysis (melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, MSI-H, 
HL and UC). Nine of the 36 treatment emergent positive subjects (1 melanoma, 5 NSCLC, 1 HL and 2 UC) tested 
positive in the neutralizing assay and thus were considered as ‘treatment emergent neutralizing positive’, 
accounting  for a total incidence rate of treatment emergent neutralizing positive subjects of 0.4% (9 out of 
2034) in the overall population. No impact of binding or neutralizing ADA on pembrolizumab exposure was 
observed. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacological data submitted are considered adequate to support the proposed extension of indication in 
patients with classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Observed differences in Cmin between cHL and other tumour types 
have been observed were not clinically meaningful. The relationship between body weight and clearance 
supports the use of either fixed dose or body weight-based dosing to provide adequate and similar control of 
exposure.

Dose modifications due to toxicity 
Subjects could only receive study treatment if absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression, 
no decline in ECOG performance status, absence of rapid progression of disease. If PD was shown at the Week 
12  disease  response  assessment,  study  drug  could  be  continued,  at  the  discretion  of  the  PI,  until  the  next 
disease response assessment, provided that the subjects’ clinical condition was stable. If progression of disease 
was shown at a time point beyond Week 12 disease response assessment, the subject could not receive further 
treatment with study medication.  
Subjects  who  experienced  a  complete  or  partial  response  or  had  stable  disease  were  able  to  remain  on 
treatment for up to 2 years (approximately 37 administrations) or until unacceptable toxicity or progression.

Subjects who attained a CR may have considered stopping pembrolizumab after receiving a minimum of six 
months  of  treatment  with  at  least  two doses  since CR  had  been  confirmed.  Subjects  who  later  experienced 
disease  progression  would  have  been  eligible  for  retreatment  with  pembrolizumab  at  the  discretion  of  the 
investigator if no cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab, resuming therapy at 
the same dose and schedule as at the time of initial discontinuation. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
- To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab within each of the 3 specified cohorts, and pooled. 
- To evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab by blinded, independent central review 
(BICR) according to the IWG response criteria (Cheson, 2007) within each of the 3 cohorts of subjects with r/r 
cHL. 
Secondary objectives 
Within each of the 3 cohorts of subjects with r/r cHL: 
- To evaluate the ORR of pembrolizumab by investigator assessment according to the IWG response criteria and, 
additionally, by BICR using the 5-point scale according to the Lugano Classification. 
-  To  evaluate  Complete  Remission  Rate  (CRR)  of  pembrolizumab  by  BICR  and  by  investigator  assessment 
according  to  the  IWG  response  criteria  and,  additionally,  by  BICR  using  the  5-point  scale  according  to  the 
Lugano Classification. 
- To evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Duration of Response (DOR) with pembrolizumab by BICR and 
by investigator assessment according to the IWG response criteria. 
- To evaluate Overall Survival (OS) with pembrolizumab. 
Exploratory objectives 
Within each of the 3 cohorts, and potentially pooled: 
-  To  evaluate  ORR,  CRR,  PFS  and  DOR  for  subjects  who  continue  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  beyond 
documented progression. 
- To explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of pembrolizumab, immunogenicity and exposure of the proposed 
dose and dosing regimen 
- To evaluate changes in health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) assessments from baseline using the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) and European 
Quality of Life Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EuroQoL EQ-5D). 
-  To  compare  the  extent  of  pre-pembrolizumab  PD-L1  expression  in  tumour  biopsies  for  pembrolizumab 
responders versus non-responders. 
-  To  investigate  the  relationship  between  candidate  efficacy  biomarkers  and  anti-tumour  activity  of 
pembrolizumab utilizing pre and post-treatment lymph node biopsies and blood sampling. 
-  To  explore  the  relationship  between  genetic  variation  across  the  human  genome  and  response  to  the 
treatment administered.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Response assessment 
Anti-tumour  activity  of  pembrolizumab  was  evaluated  using  the  IWG  response  criteria  by  CT/PET.  For 
lymphomas that were not FDG-avid at screening, PET was  not repeated in follow-up assessments. The IWG 
criteria were applied by the site as the primary measure for assessment of disease response and as a basis for 
all protocol guidelines related to disease status (e.g. discontinuation of study therapy). 
Initial  disease  assessment  or  tumour  imaging  was  performed  within  28  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  trial 
treatment. CT scans were repeated every 12 weeks for subsequent assessments and PET was repeated at Week 
12 and Week 24 (and as clinically indicated) to confirm CR or PD.  
Assessment of lymphoma B symptoms occurred with each lymphoma disease response assessment.  
When a subject assessment showed PD, study drug could be continued, at the discretion of the PI, until the next 
disease response assessment, provided that the subjects’ clinical condition was stable. Imaging was, however, 
mandatory if there was clinical suspicion of progression (see also the “Treatments” section above for additional 
details on study drug continuation after initial evidence of PD). 
Bone marrow biopsies were collected at screening and to confirm CR (in subjects who had marrow involvement), 
or if clinically indicated. Lymph node biopsies were collected at screening and at Week 12. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects in the analysis population who had 
a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using IWG criteria at any time during the study. Response for 
the primary analysis was determined by BICR. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included:  
- ORR according to Investigator (site) assessment using IWG criteria;  
- ORR according to BICR using the Lugano 5-point classification; 
- Complete response rate (CRR) by BICR, defined as the proportion of subjects in the analysis population who 
have CR by IWG criteria;  
- PFS by BICR, defined as the time from first dose to the first documented disease progression according to IWG 
criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first; 
-  Duration  of  response  (DOR)  by  BICR,  defined  as  time  from  first  IWG  response  to  disease  progression  in 
subjects who achieve a PR or better 
- Overall survival (OS) defined as time from first dose to date of death. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Pre-specified exploratory efficacy endpoints included: the percentage of subjects eligible for stem cell transplant 
(SCT) post-study therapy, the percentage of subjects receiving SCT following post-study therapy (yes/no) and 
ORR, DOR, CRR, and PFS incorporating response assessments for subjects continuing pembrolizumab treatment 
after initial PD. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ-5D instruments were used to capture PRO data. The treatment effect con

PRO score change from baseline was evaluated at Week 12 to minimize loss of data due to death or disease 
progression  and  to  allow  for  comparison  in  subjects  still  on  treatment.  The  EQ-5D  and  EORTC  QLQ-C30 
questionnaires  were  administered  by  trained  site  personnel  and  completed  electronically  by  the  subjects 
themselves at the time points specified in the following order: EuroQol EQ-5D first, then EORTC QLQ-C30. 
The  PRO  completion  rate  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  completed  at  least  one  PRO 
questionnaire to obtain a valid PRO score at each visit among the ASaT population. The PRO compliance rate was 
defined as the proportion of subjects who completed at least one PRO questionnaire to obtain a valid PRO score 
among those who were expected to complete these questionnaires at each visit according to their individual 
status. These rates exclude subjects from the denominator who are missing certain visits by design (e.g., due to 
death,  discontinuation  due  to  progression,  discontinuation  due  to  AE,  other  discontinuation  of  treatment, 
translations not being available or no visit being scheduled). Visits of “treatment discontinuation” and “safety 
follow-up” were mapped to different time points according to the actual visit time window. 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 60 subjects in each Cohort for the Objective Response Rate (ORR) analysis. A 
target of 190 subjects is needed to be enrolled in the study assuming that approximately 5% of enrolled subjects 
will not be treated. For the three cohorts, there is at least 93% statistical power (1-sided nominal 2.5% alpha) 
to detect a 40% or higher ORR for the MK-3475 arm compared to a fixed control rate of 20% using the exact 
binomial test. Success for this hypothesis requires at least 16/60 responses. The selection of 20% as a fixed 
control rate was based on historical data in previously conducted studies in R/R HL prior to the approval of 
brentuximab vedotin, where response rates ranged between 18%-53% (Johnston et al, 2010, Fehniger et al, 
2011, Younes et al, 2012, and Moskowitz et al, 2012).  However, this study is being conducted in brentuximab 
vedotin failures and to date, there is no published data on the ORR in this particular patient population. Thus, a 
20% ORR was chosen as a conservative control rate considering that all subjects to be enrolled in this study 
have failed an additional line of therapy (brentuximab vedotin) than seen previously.

Statistical methods 
The analysis of primary efficacy endpoints was based on the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population, i.e., 
subjects  were  included  if  they  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  Supportive  analyses  were 
conducted in the Full-Analysis-Set (FAS) population, which consisted of all subjects who 1) received at least one 
dose of study medication; 2) had a baseline disease assessment, and 3) had a post baseline disease assessment 
OR discontinued the trial due to progressive disease/drug-related AE. 
Unless specified otherwise, analyses were conducted separately by Cohort. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the Objective Response Rate (ORR). The analysis consisted of 
the point estimate and 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method. An exact 
binomial test was conducted for each cohort versus a fixed control rate for each cohort. Secondary analyses for 
ORR were performed based on investigator's (i.e. study site) assessment and by central review based on the 
Lugano Classification (JCO, 2014).  
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017

Regarding the secondary endpoints, the complete remission rate (CRR), was analyzed by point estimates and 
95% 2-sided exact CIs. Additional analyses were based on site assessment and by central review using the 
Lugano (JCO, 2014) criteria. 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS curve. Since disease progression is 
assessed  periodically,  progressive  disease  (PD)  can  occur  any  time  in  the  time  interval  between  the  last 
assessment  where  PD  was  not  documented  and  the  assessment  when  PD  is  documented.  For  the  primary 
analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression is approximated by the date of the 
first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per IWG criteria, regardless of discontinuation of study 
drug. Death is always considered as a confirmed PD event. A secondary analysis was performed for PFS based 
on investigator's assessment. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, two sensitivity analyses 
were performed with a different set of censoring rules. The first sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary 
analysis except that it censors at the last disease assessment without PD when PD or death is documented after 
more than one missed disease assessment. The second sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis 
except that it considers initiation of new anticancer treatment to be a PD event for subjects without documented 
PD or death and lost to follow-up to be a PD event for subjects without documented PD or death and lost to 
follow-up  after  ≥  2  missed  disease  assessments.  In  the  sensitivity  analysis  2,  the  SCT  after  starting  study 
treatment  is  not  considered  a  sign  of  progression  of  disease  but  rather  the  benefit  of  treatment  as  hence 
censored at the date of SCT for the PFS analysis.  
The analysis of Duration Of Response (DOR) consisted of Kaplan-Meier estimates. Duration of response data are 
censored on the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for subjects 
who 1) do not have tumour progression and are still on study at the time of an analysis, 2) are given antitumour 
treatment (including stem cell transplant) other than the study treatment, or 3) are removed from study prior 
to documentation of tumour progression.  
Duration of Response was based upon central review according to the IWG criteria; a secondary analysis of DOR 
was conducted using investigator assessment. 
Regarding the Overall Survival endpoint, medians were estimated in the given analysis population, separately 
by cohort. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves, separately by Cohort. 
The survival rate at 6 and 12 months using the Kaplan-Meier estimates were provided. 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ-5D data were summarized, as part of the pre-specified exploratory analysis, 
and presented up to and including Week 36 assessment time point (corresponding to just beyond the median 
duration of follow-up), in the ASaT population, for all cohorts combined. Changes from baseline to Week 12 in 
the QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL domain and the EQ-5D VAS scale and Utility dimension were assessed, 
without imputation for missing data. Constrained longitudinal data analysis models were used to evaluate the 
change of PRO score from baseline to Week 12, overall, and in different subgroups of patients, by their response 
status. Descriptive analyses yielded the number and proportion of patients who “improved”, “deteriorated”, or 
remained “stable” in their QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL at Week 12, according to a 10-point or greater 
score change text from baseline. 
Consistency of ORR is across various subgroups was determined by the point estimate of the ORR  (with  an  
exact  95%  CI)  plotted  within  each  category  of  the following classification variables within each Cohort: Age 
category (≤65 vs. >65 years),  Sex (female vs. male), Race (white vs. non-white), Region (US, ex-US),Number 
of prior therapies ( ˂ 4 vs  ≥4). For Cohorts 1 and 3 only: Time elapsed since transplant failure (˂12 months vs. 
≥12  months).  No  multiplicity  adjustment  was  planned  as  there  is  a  single  comparison  of  MK-3475  using  1 
endpoint in the primary hypothesis within each Cohort. Other efficacy analyses will be considered supportive

and/or explanatory. 
An interim analysis was planned for futility alone. The interim analysis would be conducted when 50% of the 
subjects within a cohort have been evaluated for response. 
Additional efficacy analyses, that were not pre-specified in the SAP, based on refractory (PD or stable disease 
[SD] to a prior regimen) status and/or relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of prior anticancer therapy, including prior SCT, 
are also included in the present CSR.

Based on a review of baseline data entered by the Investigator, including prior therapies received, 5 subjects 
were analysed in a cohort different than originally assigned. 
Recruitment 
Study KEYNOTE-087 was conducted at 51 centers: 11 in the US; 7 in Japan; 4 each in France, Israel, and Spain; 
3 each in Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom; 2 each in Australia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, and Sweden; 
and 1 each in Canada and Norway.  
The first subject was enrolled in study Cohort 1 on 24-Jun-2015, and the last subject on 8-Feb-2016. The first 
subject was enrolled in study Cohort 2 on 24-Jun-2015, and the last subject on 16-Dec-2015. The first subject 
was enrolled in study Cohort 3 on 16-Jun-2015 and the last subject on 2-Mar-2016.

All subjects (N=210) were refractory to a previous therapy or had relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy. Subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 3 were post-auto-SCT (n = 129 total), and subjects in Cohort 2 (n = 81) had not received an 
auto-SCT. A total of 175 (83.3%) subjects had also previously failed to respond to or relapsed after treatment 
with BV. Seventy-six (36.2%) subjects had prior radiation therapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy 
was 4.0 (range: 1 to 12).

Primary endpoint: Response rates 
All subjects 
The primary endpoint ORR per BICR in the ASaT population was 68.1% (143/210; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
61.3%, 74.3%). CR rate (CRR) per BICR in the ASaT population was 21.9% (46/210, 95% CI 16.5%, 28.1%)   
Table 7: Summary of best overall response based on central review per IWG (ASaT)  
Five subjects “not evaluable” for response by BICR  were considered non-responders. Four of these subjects 
discontinued the study without their first efficacy assessment at Week 12, and the fifth subject was considered 
PD at Day 16 by site review, leading to discontinuation, but not read by central review as an on-study scan.  
Table 8: Response rates based on IWG criteria - by site review. 
Cohort 1 
The primary endpoint ORR was 72.5% (50/69; 95% CI: 60.4%, 82.5%) per BICR in the ASaT population of 
Cohort  1  (N=69)  which  was  significantly  greater  than  the  expected  20%  (p-value  <  0.001);  CRR  is  21.7% 
(15/69, 95% CI 12.7%, 33.3%).

The median PFS per site review in the ASaT population in all subjects was 11.1 months (95% CI: 8.1 months, 
NR). The site-assessed PFS rate at 3 and 6 months was 89.9% and 73.1%, respectively.  
Two sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan of the protocol 
(see also the “statistical methods” section above). The results observed using the first approach (Sensitivity 
Analysis 1) were similar to the primary analyses (median PFS in all subjects by BICR 10.8 months [95% CI 8.3 
months,  NR]).  PFS  estimates  under  the  second,  more  conservative,  approach  (Sensitivity  Analysis  2)  were 
reduced (median PFS in all subjects by BICR 8.5 months [95% CI 8.0 months, NR].  
Cohort 1 
Table 13: PFS data per BICR in the ASaT population - Cohort 1 
The median PFS in the ASaT population of Cohort 1 per site review was not reached (95% CI: 8.1 months, not 
reached). The site-assessed PFS rate in Cohort 1  at 6 and 12 months  was 90.6% and 79.0%, respectively. 
Results from sensitivity analyses were overall consistent with the primary analysis for Cohort 1.

Compliance rates for both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D were ~90% or above at baseline, and over 96% at 
Week 12. Completion rates remained above 90% at each time point after baseline, until Week 24, when they 
dropped  as  patients  discontinued  the  study  due  to  disease  progression,  physician  decision,  AEs,  or  death 
(compliance  rates  were  78.8%  and  78.2%  at  Week  24  and  52.9%  and  52.9%  at  Week  36  for  the  EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires, respectively). 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
The proportion of subjects with “improved”, “stable”, or “deteriorated” global health status/QoL at Week 12 
according to a 10 point or greater change from baseline is summarised in Table below. 
Table 17: Summary of EORTC QLQ-C30 Scores at week 12  
Global health status/QoL deteriorated by 10 or more points at Week 12 in approximately 6% to 10% fewer 
subjects with CR/PR than in subjects with SD or PD. Conversely, global health status/QoL improved by 10 or 
more points at Week 12 in about 2% to 10% more CR/PR subjects than in SD and PD subjects. The longitudinal 
changes from baseline to Week 12 in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scores are summarised in 
Table below, together with the least squares (LS) mean (95% CI) of the score change from baseline to Week 12.

Table 18: Analysis of change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 at week 12 (ASaT) 
The baseline global health status/QoL score was similar across all response subgroups, and at week 12 there 
was  an  overall  improvement  of  8.5  points  (standard  error:  1.6)  compared  to baseline.  The  difference  in  LS 
means between responders and non-responders at Week 12 was 4.5 points (95% CI: -0.44, 9.44; two-sided 
nominal p=0.0739). 
EQ-5D 
The EQ-5D VAS score at baseline was similar across CR/PR, SD, and PD subgroups.  
Table 19: Analysis of change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS at week 12 (ASaT) 
At week 12 there was an overall improvement of 8.2 points (standard error: 1.4) from baseline (a change in VAS 
score of 7 or more points has been reported to be clinically meaningful in cancer patients). Improvement was 
greatest  for  those  with  CR/PR  (+10.7  points),  followed  by  SD  (+5.2  points),  and  PD  (+3.2  points).  The 
difference in LS means of the score change between responders and non-responders was 4.2 points (95% CI: 
-0.10, 8.41; two-sided nominal p=0.0558). 
The EQ-5D Utility scores showed consistency of results, with similarity of scores at baseline across all response 
sub-groups, and subjects with CR/PR having a comparatively better improvement in their Utility scores from 
baseline to Week 12, than subjects with SD or PD (respectively, +0.09 points vs. +0.03 points vs. -0.02 points). 
The difference in LS means of the score change between responders and non-responders was 0.08 points (95%

CI: 0.023, 0.134; two-sided nominal p=0.0057). 
Stem Cell Transplant Post-Study Therapy 
There  were  1/210  subjects  (0.5%)  who  underwent  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  at  some  point  after 
treatment with pembrolizumab. A total of 6/210 subjects (2.9%) underwent allogeneic transplant at some point 
after treatment with pembrolizumab. 
At  the  time  of  the  update  analysis  (data  cut-off  date  25/09/2016),  with  an  additional  3.0  months  of  safety 
follow-up, there were a total of 4 subjects who underwent autologous SCT following pembrolizumab therapy. All 
4 subjects were known to be alive as of the last survival follow-up date. With respect to allogeneic SCT, 10 
subjects in KEYNOTE-087 had a transplant at some point after the study, an increase of 4 subjects. One subject 
of the 10 died due to graft versus host disease (GvHD); the remaining 9 subjects were alive as of the most 
recent follow-up. The median follow-up duration from date of allogeneic transplant to death or last date the 
subject was known to be alive for these 10 subjects was 3.5 months (range: 0.03-10.3 months). However, 1 
subject who received allogeneic SCT within 1 month of the data cutoff date had not yet been contacted after 
transplant. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate pembrolizumab activity in cHL according to: refractory vs. 
relapsed  after  ≥  3  lines  of  therapy;  number  of  prior  therapies,  age,  race,  region,  gender  and  time  since 
transplant failure. 
Refractory vs. relapsed after ≥ 3 Lines of therapy 
Response rates 
Table 20: Summary of response rates (IWG) by status of refractory or relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy: 
Note: Subjects were categorized as refractory or relapsed in a hierarchical manner (mutually exclusive categories), where 
refractory included subjects who were refractory to any one or more lines of therapy and relapsed included subjects who had 
relapsed disease after ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy, but who were not refractory at any point. 
Refractory subjects were further analyzed by whether they were refractory to the first therapy received (N=74), 
last therapy received (N=74), or any other therapy received (N=22). An additional analysis was conducted in 
primary refractory subjects, i.e. patients who were refractory to first line therapy and never achieved a response

80.6% (29/36; 95% CI: 64.0%, 91.8%), and the CRR was 25% (9/36; 95% CI: 12.1%, 42.2%). 
The ORR based on IWG criteria by BICR in subjects who relapsed after 3 or more lines of therapy regardless of 
refractory status (N= 145) was 66.2% (96/145; 95% CI: 57.9%, 73.8%). CRR was 22.1% (32/145; 95% CI: 
15.6%; 29.7%).  
An analysis was also conducted to include responses post-PD per IWG criteria by site review. The ORR in this 
analysis was consistent with the overall analysis (66.7%; 140/210; 95% CI: 59.9%, 73.0%). CRR was 25.2% 
(53/210; 95% CI: 19.5%, 31.7%). 
DOR 
Differences in DOR per BICR between subjects refractory versus those relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy were 
minor.  Among  the  170  subjects  refractory  to  any  therapy  received,  119  had  a  response  with  37  responses 
ongoing at ≥3 months and 3 responses ongoing at ≥ 6 months; median DOR was not reached (95% CI: 5.6 
months, NR).  
Among the 145 subjects relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy, 96 had a response with 31 responses ongoing at ≥ 
3 months and 2 responses ongoing at ≥ 6 months. The median DOR by BICR in subjects who relapsed after 3 or 
more lines of therapy regardless of refractory status (N = 145) was not reached (range 0.0+, 8.3+ months).  
Median DOR by site review  for subjects who  were refractory to therapy was  8.3 months (range 0.0+,  8.3+ 
months). Median DOR by site review for subjects who had relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy was not reached 
(range 0.0+, -5.6+ months).  
Number of prior therapies 
The ORR by BICR in subjects with < 3 prior therapies was 64.3% (18/28; 95% CI: 44.1%, 81.4%), while among 
subjects with ≥ 3 prior therapies, ORR was 68.7% (125/182; 95% CI: 61.4%, 75.3%).  
The differences in ORR by site review by number of prior therapies were minimal (< 3: ORR 67.9%, 19/28; 95% 
CI: 47.6%, 84.1%; ≥ 3: ORR 66.5%, 121/182; 95% CI: 59.1%, 73.3%). 
In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, differences in ORR by number of prior therapies were unable to be assessed because 
almost all of the subjects had at least 3 prior therapies (68/69). In Cohort 3, differences in ORR by BICR by 
number of prior therapies (< 3: n=24 versus ≥ 3: n=36) were consistent with the overall population. 
Time Since Transplant Failure 
Differences in ORR by BICR by time since transplant failure (< 12 months: n=85 vs. ≥ 12 months: n=44) were 
minimal. The ORR in subjects with less than 12 months since transplant failure was 65.9% (95% CI: 54.8%, 
75.8%),  while  among  subjects  with  12  months  or  more  since  transplant  failure,  ORR  was  77.3%  (95%  CI: 
62.2%, 88.5%). 
The differences in ORR by site review by time since transplant failure were similar (< 12 months: ORR 67.1%; 
95% CI: 56.0%, 76.9%; ≥ 12 months: ORR 68.2%; 95% CI: 52.4%, 81.4%). 
In  Cohort  1,  differences  in  ORR  by  BICR  by  time  since  transplant  failure  were  consistent  with  the  overall 
population. In Cohort 3, differences in ORR by time since transplant failure were difficult to discern because the 
majority of subjects were < 12 months since transplant failure (53/60). 
Age 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 47/102 
 
  
  
The ORR by BICR by subjects < 65 years of age (n=192) was higher compared to subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
(n=18). The ORR in subjects < 65 years of age was 69.8% (95% CI: 62.8%, 76.2%), while among subjects ≥ 
65 years of age, ORR was 50.0% (95% CI: 26.0%, 74.0%).  
A similar difference between age groups in ORR by site review was observed (< 65 years: ORR 68.2%; 95% CI: 
61.1%, 74.7%; ≥ 65 years: ORR 50.0%; 95% CI: 26.0%, 74.0%).  
In Cohort 1 and 3, differences in ORR by age were unable to be assessed because most of the subjects were < 
65 years. In Cohort 2, the ORR by BICR by age class was consistent with the overall population. 
The MAH performed an exploratory analysis to possibly assess the concomitant effects of baseline conditions, 
such as ECOG status or co-morbidity.  
Updated ORR results with a cut –off of 25 September 2016 were provided and are presented in the following 
table. 
As seen below, the numbers in the ECOG subgroup in the ≥ 65 year old population are small, but do not suggest 
that ECOG status adversely affects ORR in the elderly subpopulation. 
Table 21: ORR (25-Sep-2016 cut-off); overall population and in the ECOG subgroups (0 vs 1). 
Race 
ORR by BICR was consistent across race categories (white: n=185 versus non-white n=22). The ORR in white 
subjects was 68.6% (95% CI: 61.4%, 75.3%) and in non-white subjects was 63.6% (95% CI: 40.7%, 82.8%). 
There were no notable differences in ORR by site review across race categories (white: ORR 65.9%; 95% CI: 
58.6%, 72.7%; non-white: ORR 68.2%; 95% CI: 45.1%, 86.1%). ORR by race in Cohorts 1-3 was consistent 
with the overall population. 
Gender 
Differences in ORR by BICR by gender (males: n=113 versus females: n=97) were minimal. The ORR in male 
subjects was 68.1% (95% CI: 58.7%, 76.6%), while among female subjects the ORR was 68.0% (95% CI: 
57.8%, 77.1%).  
The  ORR  by  site  review  in  females  was  slightly  higher  than  in  males  (male:  ORR  60.2%;  95%  CI:  50.5%, 
69.3%; female: ORR 74.2%; 95% CI: 64.3%, 82.6%). 
In  Cohort  1,  the  ORR  by  BICR  in  females  (81.8%,  27/33;  95%  CI:  64.5%,  93.0%)  was  somewhat  higher 
compared to males (63.9%, 23/36; 95% CI: 46.2%, 79.2%).  
In Cohort 2, ORR by BICR in males (76.7%, 33/43; 95% CI: 61.4%, 88.2%) was somewhat higher compared to 
females  (52.6%,  20/38;  95%  CI:  35.8%,  69.0%),  but  this  difference  was  not  confirmed  by  the  analysis 
Assessment report

according to site review (male: ORR 67.4%, 29/43; 95% CI: 51.5%, 80.9%; female: ORR 63.2%, 24/38; 95% 
CI: 46.0%, 78.2%). 
In  Cohort  3,  the  ORR  by  BICR  in  females  (73.1%,  19/26;  95%  CI:  52.2%,  88.4%)  was  somewhat  higher 
compared to males (61.8%, 21/34; 95% CI: 43.6%, 77.8%); this difference was even greater in the analysis by 
site review (female: ORR 84.6%, 22/26; 95% CI: 65.1%, 95.6%; male: ORR 55.9%, 19/34; 95% CI: 37.9%, 
72.8%). 
Region 
The  ORR  by  BICR  by  region  (US:  n=52  versus  ex-US:  n=158)  was  73.1%  (95%  CI:  59.0%,  84.4%)  in  US 
subjects and 66.5% (95% CI: 58.5%, 73.8%) in ex-US subjects. The differences in ORR by site review by region 
were similar to the BICR assessment (US: ORR 73.1%; 95% CI: 59.0%, 84.4%; ex-US: ORR 64.6%; 95% CI: 
56.6%,  72.0%).  The  differences  in  ORR  by  BICR  by  region  in  Cohorts  1-3  were  consistent  with  the  overall 
population. The efficacy according to region EU or ex-EU is generally consistent with the primary analyses in the 
global population.

Pseudoprogression 
Based  on  investigator  assessment  using  an  updated  database  cutoff  date  (25-Sep-2016),  there  were  13 
subjects in KEYNOTE-087 who progressed and continued to receive pembrolizumab, of which 2 subsequently 
achieved remission. Among these 13 subjects, 2 achieved remission following PD per investigator assessment. 
Among these 13 subjects, there was one reported death; 4 deaths in 210 subjects overall in the KEYNOTE-087 
population.

There  were  47  subjects  with  best  response  of  CR  (central  review)  in  the  updated  database  (25-Sep-2016 
cutoff)..  
Table 25: Summary Statistics by Discontinuation Reason in CR pts in KN-087 
As of the 25-Sep-2016 data cutoff date, no subjects in KEYNOTE-087 who stopped treatment due to CR began 
re-treatment, i.e. “second course” of pembrolizumab treatment, per protocol. 
Post –hoc Analysis of Baseline prognostic factors for r/r cHL patients  
Time-to-relapse following completion of first-line therapy, Ann Arbor stage at relapse and anaemia at relapse 
were  identified  in  Josting  et  al  (2002)  as  independent  risk  factors  in  r/r  cHL  in  previous  studies.  For 
KEYNOTE-087, the MAH has conducted an exploratory analysis to assess these risk factors based on the updated 
efficacy data (25-Sep-2016).  
Hemoglobin  
An analysis, performed based on the specified gender-specific “low” thresholds (<10.5 gm/dL for females and 
<12.0 gm/dL for males), did not show any difference in the primary endpoint of ORR per central review between 
subjects with low hemoglobin (69.0% [49/71]) and subjects with adequate hemoglobin (68.6% [94/137)]; 2 
subjects were missing this information at baseline.  
Stage 
The ORR per central review was similar in subjects with “locally advanced” disease (70.9% [78/110] and in 
subjects with “metastatic” disease 66.0% [64/97]); 3 subjects were missing this information at baseline.  
Early vs Late Relapse 
The categories of refractory, early relapse and late relapse had 103, 31, and 43 subjects, respectively, and the 
key efficacy endpoints for KEYNOTE-087 are presented in Table below. Of the 210 subjects in KEYNOTE-087, 33 
subjects were excluded: 12 subjects had missing or non-evaluable response to first-line therapy and 21 subjects 
with remission were missing either date of treatment completion or date of progression.

PD-L1 expression (post-hoc analysis requested by the CHMP) 
In  KEYNOTE-087,  a  total  of  177  patients  across  all  cohorts  (out  of  210  treated  subjects)  had  evaluable 
pre-treatment tumour tissue. The analysis below is based on the “membrane staining score” for the categories 
of “< 1%” versus “≥ 1%”. 
For KEYNOTE-013, only the categorization of “positive” versus “negative” PD-L1 status is available for analysis, 
defined as positive if at least 1% of the Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells were positive for PD-L1 membrane 
staining with staining intensity of 2+ or higher. In KEYNOTE-013 there were 12 subjects with pre-treatment 
samples available out of the 31 subjects treated (see Table below). 
Since the numbers are limited and due to the high expression of PD-L1 in these patients, only the descriptive 
statistics are presented, i.e., best response according to central review and interpretation is limited due to the 
small  numbers  with  low  PD-L1  expression.  Analyses  are  based  on  the  updated  databases  (Data  cut-off  of

Study identifier 
KEYNOTE-087; NCT02453594 
Design 
KEYNOTE-087  is  multicenter,  single  arm,  multi-cohort,  nonrandomized  trial  of 
pembrolizumab in subjects with r/r cHL: 
-  who  have  failed  to  achieve  a  response  or  progressed  after  autologous  stem  cell 
transplant  (ASCT)  and  have  relapsed  after  treatment  with,  or  failed  to  respond  to, 
brentuximab vedotin (BV) post ASCT (Cohort 1);  
- who were unable to achieve a CR or PR to salvage chemotherapy and did not receive 
ASCT, but have relapsed after treatment with, or failed to respond to, BV (Cohort 2);  
and  subjects  who  have  failed  to  respond  to,  or  progressed  after,  ASCT  and  have  not 
received BV post auto-SCT. These subjects may or may not have received BV as part of 
primary or salvage treatment (Cohort 3). 
The  primary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  of 
pembrolizumab by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to the Revised 
Response  Criteria  for  Malignant  Lymphoma  (2007)  from  the    International  Working 
Group (IWG); and (2) determine the safety and  tolerability of pembrolizumab.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A systematic literature review of response to standard of care therapies for heavily pretreated 
patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 
The purpose of this systematic literature review was to synthesize the response in cHL patients ineligible for 
ASCT or relapsed/refractory after ≥ 3 treatments (including ASCT, if eligible) with the treatments recommended 
by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). 
Methods 
PUBMED  (Medline),  Cochrane,  and  EMBASE  databases  were  searched  to  identify  prospective  clinical  trials 
published in English language since January 1, 1985. Both, randomized controlled trials (RCT) as well as single 
arm  trials  were  included  in  this  review.  For  the  purpose  of  this  review,  SOC  was  defined  as  any  agent 
recommended in the NCCN guidelines (Version 2.2015) as a treatment option for r/r cHL. 
The complete search queries, as implemented in PUBMED, Cochrane and EMBASE, were reported in section 6.0 
of the Systematic Literature Review Report included in the dossier.

Results 
A total of 7145 records were identified in the literature search, of which 67 were trials in the r/r cHL population 
using  a  NCCN  therapy.  Most  of  the  67  studies  in  the  r/r  setting  enrolled  patients  with  only  1  or  2  prior 
treatments. No dedicated prospective clinical study  was  found in the patient  population who is ineligible for 
transplant.

Table 32: Studies in cHL patients who are refractory/relapsed after ≥ 3 treatments (similar to the population 
studied in KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087): 
The  responses  in  the  subgroup  of  heavily  pretreated  refractory  patients  were  not  separately  reported. 
Additionally, the benefit/risk in most of these studies was poorly characterized considering the small study sizes 
(only  one  study  with  102  patients;  the  remaining  studies  with  16  to  38  patients).  These  studies  represent 
therapies  with  different  mechanisms  of  action,  which  is  likely  driving  differences  in  response.  Hence,  a 
meta-analysis was not performed to obtain an overall average response across studies/therapies. 
The study with BV stands out in terms of ORR (75% in 102 patients). However, median DOR (6.7 months) and 
PFS (5.6 months) were modest and within the range of chemotherapy treatments. Furthermore, 55% of the 
patients experienced AEs of grade 3 or higher, and 20% discontinued due to adverse events (AEs), suggesting 
benefit/risk with BV may not be favourable for some patients because of tolerability issues. It should also be 
noted that the study with BV excluded patients ineligible for auto-SCT, and a lower ORR of 30% was reported 
with BV in a retrospective analysis of two Phase 1 studies in the subgroup of patients who were not candidates 
for ASCT (Forero-Torres A et al, Oncologist 2012).  
Everolimus and bendamustine had ORRs around 50% but PFS was modest: 6.2 months with everolimus and 5.2 
months with bendamustine. Additionally, with everolimus, the majority (74%) of patients experienced grade ≥ 
3 AEs. The use of lenalidomide in this setting has yielded modest ORRs of < 38%. 
Several studies were noted during this systematic literature review investigation with good responses in rrcHL 
patients  but  were  considered  unsuitable  for  comparison  with  KEYNOTE-013  and  KEYNOTE-087  due  to  the 
reasons outlined below. 
- A retrospective study with bendamustine reported an ORR of 56% in patients who had previously failed BV 
(Zinzani PL et al., Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk 2015). Considering this systematic literature review focused on 
prospective studies, this study did not meet the criterion of a suitable comparator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 58/102 
 
  
  
 
 
 
-  A  study  of  retreatment with  BV  in  patients  who  previously  responded  (CR/PR)  to  the  same  BV  treatment, 
discontinued treatment while in remission, and subsequently experienced disease progression or relapse. This 
study reported an ORR of 60% (Bartlett NL, J Hematol Oncol 2014). Considering this study enrolled only the 
subgroup  of  patients  who  have  previously  responded  to  BV,  the  patient  population  was  more  restrictive 
compared to KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087. Adverse events that were ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 48% of patients 
and led to discontinuation in 31% of the patients (including HL and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
patients). 
- A recent follow-up to the pivotal BV study (Younes et al. JCO 2012) reported updated response but it was based 
on  investigator  assessment,  instead  of  independent  review  by  central  facility.  Furthermore,  patients  who 
received allogeneic stem cell transplant following BV treatment were also included in the efficacy assessments 
making it difficult to characterize the clinical benefit of BV. 
- A conference abstract (Johnston PB et al, Blood 2012) reported an ORR of 42% with everolimus. However, the 
abstract did not provide sufficient details about how heavily pretreated patient population was enrolled, e.g., 
median and/or range of prior lines of therapy were not reported. Also, grade 3/4 adverse events were observed 
in 58% of the patients. 
Supportive studies 
A  Phase  Ib  Multi-Cohort  Trial  of  MK-3475  (pembrolizumab)  in  Subjects  with  Haematologic 
Malignancies (KEYNOTE-013) 
Study KEYNOTE-013 was  a multicenter, multi-cohort trial of pembrolizumab in subjects with haematological 
malignancies to determine the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab. This study was conducted at 5 centres: 2 
in the United States, 1 each in Canada, France, and Italy. 
With  respect  to  the  present  application,  data  in  cHL  come  from  Cohort  3,  which  included  subjects  with 
relapsed/refractory nodular sclerosing or mixed cellularity cHL that had failed, were ineligible for, or refused a 
stem cell transplant and had relapsed after treatment with or failed to respond to brentuximab vedotin.

and to evaluate complete remission rate (CRR) based on the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
(2007) from the International Working Group (IWG) in subjects with r/r nodular sclerosing or mixed cellularity 
cHL that have failed, are ineligible for, or refused a stem cell transplant. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS, ORR and DOR. 
Patients with r/r nodular sclerosing or mixed cellularity cHL, aged ≥ 18 years, with a 0/1 ECOG performance 
status  and  with  measurable  disease  were  considered  eligible.  All  subjects  must  have  failed/were  ineligible 
for/refused a stem cell transplant (where stem cell transplant is standard of care) and must have relapsed after 
treatment with (or failed to) respond to brentuximab vedotin (BV). Patients with active infections, autoimmune 
diseases or who had received prior allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the last 5 years 
were excluded. 
Pembrolizumab was administered at the 10 mg/kg dose iv every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease 
progression, or up to 52 doses (approximately 2 years). 
The full analysis set (FAS) population (defined as all subjects who had at least one dose of pembrolizumab, had 
a baseline efficacy evaluation, and at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation or discontinued treatment due 
to pembrolizumab-related AE or PD) was to serve as the primary population for the analyses of efficacy data in 
this trial. Supportive analyses of efficacy were to be conducted in the intention-to-treat population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the HL cohort was to be CRR, defined as the proportion of subjects meeting the 
IWG  response  criteria  for  a  CR  at  any  time  during  the  study.  Response  for  the  primary  analysis  was  to  be 
assessed  by  the  investigator  using  the  IWG  response  criteria  by  computed  tomography/positron  emission 
tomography (PET) at Week 12 and then every 8 weeks. Assessment of lymphoma B symptoms occurred with 
each  lymphoma  disease  response  assessment.  Bone  marrow  biopsies  were  collected  at  screening,  and  to 
confirm  CR  (in  subjects  who  had  marrow  involvement),  or  if  clinically  indicated.  Lymph  node  biopsies  were 
collected at Screening and at Week 12. Blood for correlative biomarkers studies was collected at Screening, 
Week 12, and upon PD.  
A 90% confidence interval (CI) (two-sided) along with a one-sided p-value for testing the null hypothesis (CRR 
≤ 0.10) based on the binomial distribution was to be provided. The HL cohort was considered to have reached 
the efficacy objective if the corresponding one-sided p-value for testing the respective null hypothesis was less 
than 5%. 
Secondary  endpoints  in  the  HL  cohort  included:  PFS,  OS,  ORR,  DOR,  PD-L1  expression  at  baseline  among 
responders/non-responders.  
Results 
The first r/r cHL subject was enrolled in the study on 03-Dec-2013 and the last on 23-Jul-2014. At the time of 
data cutoff date (03-June-2016) a total of 31 subjects were enrolled and 23 subjects had discontinued study 
treatment.  The  primary  reason  for  discontinuation  for  14  (45.2%)  subjects  was  disease  progression. 
Discontinuations  due  to  AEs  were  reported  for  3  (9.7%)  of  subjects.  Treatment  was  ongoing  in  3  (9.7%) 
subjects (see Table below). The median duration of follow-up, defined as the time from first dose to the date of 
death or the database cutoff if the subject was still alive, was 24.9 months (range 7.0 to 29.7 months).

Table 33: Subjects’ Disposition 
Subjects were 58.1% male and 93.5% white. Median age was 32 years. Enrollment was approximately equal 
between US (51.6%) and ex-US (48.4%) subjects. All subjects had cHL according to the following subgroups: 
30 (96.8%) subjects had nodular sclerosing HL, and 1 (3.2%) had mixed cellularity HL. All subjects (n = 31) 
were refractory to a previous therapy (100%), or had relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy (96.8%). Twenty-three 
(74.2%) subjects had failed to respond to or relapsed after a previous auto-SCT, and 8 (25.8%) were ineligible 
for auto-SCT. All subjects had also previously failed to respond to or relapsed after treatment with BV. Thirteen 
(41.9%) subjects had prior radiation therapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (range 2 to 
15). Twenty-nine percent of patients had documented bulky disease, and B symptoms were present in 32.3% of 
patients.  
The primary population for efficacy analyses was the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population. Subjects who 
received at least one dose of study medication were included.  
Complete response was defined as having no evidence of disease, including being PET-negative. CRR, the study 
primary endpoint, per both BICR and site review in all subjects was 19.4% (6/31; 90% CI: 8.8%, 34.7%; p = 
0.0834). ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR or PR, was 58.1% (18/31; 95% CI: 39.1%, 
75.5%) per blinded, independent central review (BICR) and 64.5% (20/31; 95% CI: 45.4%, 80.8%) per site 
review. 
The median time to response (TTR) per BICR was 2.8 months (range 2.4 to 8.6 months) and median DOR was 
not reached (range 0.0+ to 21.4+ months) (95% CI: 3.7 months, not reached). Among the 18 subjects with 
response,  a  response  of  at  least  6  months  in  duration  was  observed  in  9  subjects  (80.0%  by  Kaplan-Meier 
method), and a response of at least 12 months in duration was observed in 7 subjects (70.0% by Kaplan-Meier 
method). At the time of data cutoff, 4 (22.2%) responders were ongoing.

Median OS was not reached (95% CI: not reached, not reached). OS rate at 6 months was 100% and at 12

- subjects who failed auto-SCT, then failed BV (N = 16); 
- subjects who were transplant ineligible, then failed BV (N = 8);  
- subjects who progressed after BV, then progressed after auto-SCT (N = 7). 
In subjects who failed auto-SCT and BV, the ORR was 68.8% (11/16) per BICR. CRR was 18.8% (3/16). The 
median time to response by BICR was 2.8 months (range 2.4 to 8.6 months). Median DOR by BICR was not 
reached  (range  2.1  to  21.4+  months).  Among  the  16  subjects  with  response,  7  (81.8%  by  Kaplan-Meier 
method) subjects had a response duration of ≥ 6 months and 5 (68.2% by Kaplan-Meier method) subject had 
a response duration of ≥ 12 months. At the database cut-off date, there were 3 (27.3%) subjects who had 
ongoing response for ≥ 12 months. 
In subjects who were ineligible for auto-SCT and failed BV, the ORR was 37.5% (3/8) per BICR. CRR was 25% 
(2/8). The median time to response by BICR was 2.8 months (range 2.6 to 3.1 months). Median DOR was not 
reached  (range  0.0+  to  19.1+  months).  Among  the  3  subjects  with  response,  1  (50.0%  by  Kaplan-Meier 
method) subject had a response duration of ≥ 6 months and 1 (50.0% by Kaplan-Meier method) subject had a 
response duration of ≥ 12 months. At the database cut-off date, 1 (33.3%) subject had ongoing response by 
BICR. 
In subjects who failed BV and then failed auto-SCT, the ORR was 57.1% (4/7) per BICR. CRR was 14.3% (1/7). 
The median time to response by BICR was 2.9 months (range 2.8 to 4.5 months). Median DOR was 14.7 months 
(range 1.4+ to 14.7 months; 95% CI: not reached, not reached). Among the 4 subjects with response, 1 (100% 
by Kaplan-Meier method) subject had a response duration of ≥ 6 months and ≥ 12 months. At the database 
cut-off date, no subjects had ongoing response by BICR. 
Subgroup analyses according to number of lines of prior therapies and refractoriness status were also reported. 
The ORR by BICR among subjects who relapsed after ≥ 3 lines of therapy was 60.0%, the CRR was 16.0% 
(4/25; 95% CI: 4.5%, 36.1%) and the median DOR was 18.1 months (range 1.4+ to 21.4+ months). 
The ORR by BICR among subjects who were refractory to any prior therapy was 55.6% (15/27), 58.3% (7/12) 
among subjects refractory to first therapy received, 54.5% (6/11) among subjects refractory to last therapy 
received,  50.0%  (2/4)  among  subjects  refractory  to  any  other  therapy  received  and  50.0%  (2/4)  among 
subjects who were primary refractory (i.e. refractory to their firstline therapy who never achieved CR or PR in 
subsequent therapies). The CRR by BICR for subjects with refractory disease was 22.2% (6/27), and the median 
DOR was 18.1 months (range 0.0+, 21.4+). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support the Keytruda extension of indication in the treatment of adult patients with cHL who have refractory 
disease, or have relapsed after greater than 3 prior lines of therapy, the MAH submitted the results from one 
single pivotal study (phase 2 trial KEYNOTE-087) and from the cHL cohort of phase 1b study KEYNOTE-013.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study KEYNOTE-087  
In  the  pivotal  study  KEYNOTE-087  pembrolizumab  activity  was  investigated  in  three  different  r/r  cHL 
populations, including patients refractory to /relapsed  after  auto-SCT and BV received after transplantation 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 63/102 
 
  
  
 
(Cohort  1);  patients  refractory  to  salvage  chemotherapy,  auto-SCT  naïve,  refractory  to  /relapsed  after  BV 
(Cohort 2); patients refractory to /relapsed  after auto-SCT, naïve  to BV post-transplantation but who could 
have received BV as part of primary treatment, or salvage treatment (Cohort 3).    
The provided eligibility criteria are considered overall adequate to define the target population in each of the 
three  cHL  cohorts.  The  high  unmet  need  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  is  not  questioned,  and  the  lack  of  standard 
alternatives when ASCT and BV are no longer an option justifies the lack of comparator. As mentioned in the 
CHMP  scientific  advice  (EMEA/H/SA2437/9/2015/II),  an  approval  based  on  data  from  a  single,  uncontrolled 
pivotal  trial  would  not  be  refused  in  principle,  in  a  clinical  setting  where  no  effective  alternatives  can  be 
identified. Conversely, it is noted that a subset of the patients enrolled in Cohort 3 are still eligible for treatment 
with BV (i.e. BV naïve patients). The lack of comparator in this setting is hardly acceptable. This is reflected in 
the revised indication proposed by the MAH (“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  relapsed/refractory  classical  Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (cHL)  who  have  failed  autologous  stem  cell 
transplant (ASCT) and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV”), that 
specifically  excludes  subjects  who  are  BV  naïve  and  for  whom  treatment  with  BV  could  still  be  a  treatment 
option. 
The study primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab within each of the 3 study 
cohorts.  ORR  according  to  the  IWG  response  criteria  (Cheson,  2007),  as  assessed  by  blinded  independent 
central review (BICR), was the primary efficacy endpoint. Even though, PFS/DFS or OS are usually preferred in 
trials investigating new treatments in haematologic malignancies (see the EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4 guideline) 
their interpretation in the absence of a randomised control would be problematic. In this context, ORR can be 
considered an acceptable primary endpoint.  
Subjects who experienced a CR /PR or had stable disease could remain on treatment for up to 2 years, or until 
unacceptable  toxicity  or  progression.  In  the  case  CR  were  maintained  for  a  minimum  of  6  months, 
discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  was  permitted  with  restart  only  at  the  time  of  disease  progression.  The 
possibility to discontinue pembrolizumab in presence of a stable CR is considered of great clinical value in cHL, 
especially if the young median age of the patients is taken into account. Unfortunately, the currently available 
data (only 13 patients had discontinued pembrolizumab due to CR at the time of the most recent data cutoff 
date) are not considered sufficient to issue specific recommendation on treatment discontinuation.  
In accordance to current clinical practice, tumour response was assessed by CT/PET (CT scans were repeated 
every 12 weeks and PET was repeated at Week 12, Week 24 and as clinically indicated to confirm CR or PD). In 
order  to  account  for  pseudoprogression  patients  with  a  first  assessment  of  PD  at  week  12  could  continue 
pembrolizumab until the next disease response assessment, based on physician discretion. This is considered 
acceptable, however, the impact of the unique histological structure of cHL (unlike most other neoplasms, in cHL 
the vast majority of tumour mass consists of non-clonal inflammatory cells) on pseudoprogression is currently 
poorly characterized (only 13 patients in pivotal study KEYNOTE-087 continued pembrolizumab after an initial 
assessment  of  PD,  and  only  2/13  reached  a  subsequent  clinical  response)  and  would  deserve  further 
investigation.   
Study KEYNOTE-013 
Supportive data from cohort 3 of study KEYNOTE-013, including only patients with nodular sclerosis or mixed 
cellularity cHL refractory to /relapsed after both ASCT and BV, were submitted. 
A different pembrolizumab regimen was administered across the two studies, the fixed 200 mg Q3W dose in 
study KEYNOTE-087 and the weight-based 10 mg/Kg Q2W in study KEYNOTE-013. 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 64/102 
 
  
  
The study primary efficacy objective was to evaluate CRR with pembrolizumab based on the 2007 IWG Revised 
Criteria. Response was assessed by CT/PET at Week 12 and then every 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included PFS, OS, ORR and DOR.  
Systematic Literature Review  
To further contextualize the efficacy data observed in the provided single arm studies, the MAH also provided a 
systematic 
literature 
review 
to  summarize 
the  available 
information  on 
response 
rates  with 
NCCN-recommended treatments in cHL patients ineligible for ASCT or relapsed/refractory after ≥ 3 treatments. 
PUBMED (Medline), Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify prospective clinical trials since 
January 1, 1985, and a total of 7145 records were identified. At the end of the selection process, however, only 
6 publications were retained. These studies represent therapies with different mechanisms of action, with large 
heterogeneity in terms of response rates (reported ORRs ranged from 18% to 53%, median DOR  from 5 to 7 
months,  and  median  PFS  between  4  and  6  months).  As  a  consequence,  no  meta-analysis  was  eventually 
performed,  and  the  main  information  that  emerged  from  this  review  was  that  robust  clinical  data  in  such 
advanced cHL setting are currently lacking 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population in KN-087 is considered representative of patients with advanced r/r cHL. The majority of 
patients  had  nodular  sclerosis  cHL  (80.5%),  with  mixed  cellularity  representing  approximately  10%  of  the 
overall  study  population,  and  the  rarer  lymphocyte-rich  and  lymphocyte-depleted  subtypes  less  than  5%. 
Nearly 10% of subjects had bulky disease and 30% presented B symptoms at the time of enrolment.  
The patient population enrolled in KN-013 is representative of a more advanced clinical setting, with a median 
number of 5 prior lines of therapy including BV and is not fully comparable to the pivotal study.  
In the pivotal KN-087, the analysis by central review in the overall population at the time of the most recent data 
cut-off date (25/09/2016) showed a clinically relevant activity of pembrolizumab, with  ORR 69% (CRR 22.4%). 
The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for ORR was above 60%, and the analysis by site review (ORR 
66%,  CRR  25%)  was  also  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  Similar  outcomes  were  observed  across  all 
cohorts (ORR by central review was 73.9%, 64.2% and 70% and CRR 21.7%, 24.7% and 20% in Cohorts 1, 2 
and 3 respectively) and the provided waterfall plots showed some level of tumour reduction in the vast majority 
of patients. Overall, subgroup analyses show consistency among subgroups and support the primary results.  
Results observed in the supportive study KN-013 at the time of the most recent data cut-off date (27/09/2016) 
were  broadly  consistent.  Compared  to  KN-087,  a  lower  ORR  (58.1%)  by  BICR  was  reported.  This  slightly 
reduced activity can be related to the differences in study population across the two studies. However, it is also 
noted that the analysis by site review (ORR 20/31; 64.5%) and the CRR by BICR (19.4%) are in accordance with 
the magnitude of effect observed in the pivotal study.  
Results in terms of time-to-event endpoints are difficult to put into context in the framework of an uncontrolled 
study. Overall, DOR (median not reached in both studies) and median PFS by BICR (11.3 months in KN-087 and 
11.4  months  in  KN-013)  suggest  that  durable  responses  can  be  achieved  with  pembrolizumab,  even  in  this 
advanced setting of disease. OS results were still immature in both KN-087 (only 4 events) and KN-013 (87% of 
subjects were still alive at 12 months). At the time of the most recent data cut-off date, the median follow-up 
was  quite  short  for  KN-087  (10.1  months),  but  was  significantly  longer  for  the  supportive  KN-013  (28.7 
months). Results of further secondary/exploratory endpoints (i.e, ORR/CRR by BICR  using the 5-point scale 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 65/102 
 
  
  
 
according to the Lugano Classification, correlation of  PD-L1 level expression in tumour biopsies and response to 
pembrolizumab) were not yet available.  
The secondary/exploratory analyses will be included in the final CSR for study KN-087, which is planned to be 
submitted by 3Q2021 (see Annex II).  
The MAH also provided several additional analyses by response status (refractory or relapsed after ≥3 lines of 
therapy) and by number of previous therapy (<3 vs. ≥3 lines of therapy). Prior SCT was counted as one line of 
therapy. The term refractory was defined as best response of stable disease or PD to any prior line of therapy. 
Subjects  who  were  refractory  were  further  analysed  by  whether  they  were  refractory  to  the  first  therapy 
received, last therapy received, or any other therapy received. The ORRs in these subgroups range roughly 
between  50  and  80%;  in  some  cases  with  wide  confidence  intervals  due  to  small  sample  sizes.  No  clear 
correlations can be seen between response rates and possible assumptions based on biological rationales (for 
example  possible  lower  response  rates  for  more  intensively  pre-treated  patients  or  for  subjects  who  were 
refractory  to  all  lines  of  prior  treatment).  These  analyses  were  not  pre-specified  in  the  SAP  and  were  likely 
performed  after  review  of  the  characteristics  of  the  study  population  and  support  the  currently  proposed 
wording of the indication. 
In study KN-087, HR-QoL PROs (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) were analysed in 182 subjects who received at 
least one dose of study medication and completed at least one PRO instrument. Overall, compliance rates were 
high (i.e. above 90% until week 24), and both PROs instruments consistently pointed toward an improvement 
in global health status for responders. However, the added value of this analysis in the assessment of clinical 
benefit with pembrolizumab is considered limited. In fact, all comparisons referred to subgroups in the same 
treatment  arm  (responders  and  non-responders)  that  are  intuitively  associated  to  health  status,  even  in 
absence of a significant treatment effect. Moreover, no formal hypothesis was formulated in the study protocol 
regarding the extent of the expected changes, and no strategy to control multiplicity was employed.  
Overall,  the  analyses  by  central  and  site  review  in  patients  already  exposed  to  BV  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  (i.e. 
patients  with  few  or  none  recognized  alternatives,  since  BV  and  ASCT  were  not  an  option)  showed  an  ORR 
ranging  between  65%  and  74%,  that  is  considered  remarkable  in  this  advanced  setting.  Indeed,  although 
results from specific studies in patients who have failed (or are not eligible to) ASCT and have already received 
BV are not currently available, the ORR with experimental treatments in advanced cHL rarely exceeds 50% (see 
i.e. Rueda et al, Acta Oncol 2015 or Zinzani PL et al, Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk 2015). In this regard, the 
24.7%  CRR  observed  in  Cohort  2  (i.e.  patients  ineligible  to  ASCT)  is  also  of  particular  clinical  relevance. 
Transplant eligibility also relies, in fact, on the ability to achieve pre-transplant remission, since DFS and OS 
after transplant are significantly longer in patients who underwent transplant in CR (see e.g. Sureda A. et al., 
JCO 2001). Therefore, patients previously transplant-ineligible due to the persistence of residual disease could 
eventually  become  eligible  following  treatment  with  pembrolizumab,  with  all  the  implications  on  long-term 
disease control.  
The outcomes in Cohort 3 are difficult to interpret as approximately 60% of subjects in Cohort 3 were BV-naïve. 
Since ORRs as high as 60%-75% (CR rate 34%) have been reported with BV in patients for whom ASCT was no 
longer  an  option  or  as  “rechallenge”  in  patients  who  had  responded  (CR  or  PR)  to  their  last  BV-including 
treatment (see e.g. Younes A. et al. JCO 2012; Chen R. et al. Blood 2016, Gopal AK et al. Blood 2015, Bartlett 
et al. J Haematol Oncol 2014), only a direct comparison could assess the actual clinical benefit of pembrolizumab 
vs. BV in this clinical setting. The indication was revised to exclude BV-naïve patients.  
Further,  all  81  subjects  in  Cohort  2  of  KN-087  and  8  subjects  in  KN-013  were  ineligible  for  auto-SCT.  The 
inclusion  criteria  for  Cohort  2  required  that  subjects  “were  unable  to  achieve  a  CR  or  a  PR  to  salvage 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 66/102 
 
  
  
chemotherapy” as the reason for not being eligible for auto-SCT. Apart from 4 subjects who were not candidates 
for auto-SCT because of advanced age and comorbidities, and one subject who refused the procedure, all other 
subjects  in  both  studies  were  ineligible  for  auto-SCT  due  to  chemo-refractory  disease  to  salvage  therapy. 
Therefore only insufficient efficacy or safety data are available to support the treatment with pembrolizumab for 
subjects who are considered ineligible for auto-SCT due to other reasons than chemo-refractory disease such as 
advanced disease or comorbidities.  
Apart  from  chemoresistance,  transplant  ineligibility  is  usually  determined  by  age  and  comorbidities.  In  this 
regard, only 18 patients were aged ≥ 65 years in pivotal study KN-087 and, as reported by the MAH, the activity 
of  pembrolizumab  in  this  subpopulation  (ORR  50%)  seems  to  be  somehow  reduced  compared  to  younger 
subjects (ORR 71%). Similarly, with all the limits of considering performance status as a surrogate measure of 
comorbidity, median DOR and PFS appear to be slightly reduced in patients with ECOG score ≥1 vs. ECOG score 
0. In addition, subjects in KN-087 and KN-013 with ECOG status of 1 had higher rates of drug-related AEs, Grade 
3-5 AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation compared to subjects with ECOG PS of 0. The results 
observed  in  the  small  subset  of  patients  in  KN-087  (n=5)  who  have  received  pembrolizumab  albeit 
transplant-ineligible  due  to  reasons  other  than  failure  of  salvage  chemotherapy  (2  CR,  1  PR),  even  if 
encouraging, are nonetheless too limited to draw definitive conclusions. However, taking into account the high 
unmet  need  and  the  absence  of  effective  alternatives  for  patients  with  r/r  cHL  who  have  failed  BV  and  are 
ineligible to ASCT due to reasons other than failure of salvage chemotherapy (Linch DC et al, Lancet 1993 and 
Schmitz N et al, Lancet 2002) all patients who are transplant-ineligible regardless of the reasons for ineligibility, 
should  be  covered  by  the  indication.  Uncertainties  on  the  extent  of  clinical  benefit  in  subjects  ineligible  to 
transplant due to reasons other than chemoresistance are reflected in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The submitted data support the efficacy of Keytruda as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed  or  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (cHL)  who  have  failed  autologous  stem  cell  transplant 
(ASCT)  and  brentuximab  vedotin  (BV),  or  who  are  transplant-ineligible  and  have  failed  BV.  The  efficacy  of 
Keytruda in patients who are eligible for BV cannot be evaluated; A phase III study (study KEYNOTE-204) of 
pembrolizumab vs. BV in BV-naïve subjects with r/r cHL who have failed to achieve a response to (or progressed 
after)  ASCT,  or  who  are  not  eligible  to  ASCT  and  have  received  at  least  2  prior  chemotherapy  regimens,  is 
currently  ongoing,  and  might  eventually  provide  the  additional  evidence  required  to  support  the  use  of 
pembrolizumab in an earlier setting of disease. 
Additional information about the long term efficacy of pembrolizumab in CR subjects (including subjects who 
have discontinued pembrolizumab) will be included in the final CSRs for KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-204  (see 
RMP and Annex II). Additional data on efficacy in subjects who have transplantation following treatment with 
pembrolizumab will be provided with the CSR for KEYNOTE-204.  Subjects in both treatments arms who achieve 
CR or PR and discontinue study treatment to receive SCT will continue to be followed in the trial. Disease 
assessments will be conducted every 12 week until disease progression. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on data from studies KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013, the efficacy of pembrolizumab in r/r cHL patients 
for whom ASCT and BV are not an option is considered demonstrated.  
In the absence of direct comparison, the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in r/r cHL patents still eligible to BV 
cannot be evaluated; data on comparison to BV from the Phase 3 study KN-204 are expected early 2021.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
-  The MAH will submit the final study report for study P087, A Phase II Clinical Trial of MK-3475 
(Pembrolizumab) in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL)  
-  The MAH will submit the final study report for study P013, A Phase Ib Multi-Cohort Trial of MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab) in Subjects with Haematologic Malignancies  
-  The MAH should submit the final study report for study P204: A Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, 
Clinical Trial to Compare Pembrolizumab with Brentuximab Vedotin in Subjects with Relapsed or 
Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
With the recent extension of the indication to the treatment of 2nd line NSCLC (II/07) the known pembrolizumab 
safety profile is presently based on 2799 patients (on 1232 NSCLC patients from studies KEYNOTE-001 and 
KEYNOTE-010 and on 1567 melanoma patients from studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-006). 
The now submitted safety database includes results from KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087, which comprises a 
total number of 241 subjects with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).  
Table 34:  Study Populations for the analysis of clinical safety data 
The Indication population (HL Population) (n=241) comprises subjects who participated in Study KEYNOTE-013 
and Study KEYNOTE-087.  All subjects had relapsed or refractory cHL with a median age of 35.0 years (range 18 
to 76 years). The majority of subjects were male (54.4 %) and white (88.8%). Subjects were heavily 
pre-treated, and majority of subjects had relapsed after ASCT (63.4%). The median number of prior systemic 
therapies was 4 (range 1 to 15). In the HL Population, 36.9% had radiation therapy prior to participation in 
KEYNOTE-013 or KEYNOTE-087.

The primary analyses of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation are based on all treated subjects using a 
safety window of 30 days after last dose. The safety data cut of was 03-Jun-2016 for Keynote-013 and 
27-Jun-2016 Keynote-087. Adverse events are summarized as counts and frequencies and include events from 
the first dose of pembrolizumab, up to 30 days after the last dose. Counts and listings tables for SAEs and ECIs, 
include events from the first dose, up to 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab, to account for the 
extended safety follow-up period per protocol. 
The primary analysis populations are the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) populations in study KN-013 and 
KN-087, which refer to the population of all subjects who were enrolled per study and received at least 1 dose 
of treatment. For the pooled analysis of Keynote 013 and Keynote 087, the APaT population is referred to as the 
primary analysis population.  Adverse events observed from subjects who received pembrolizumab as part of 
the in study crossover have not been presented.   
Patient exposure 
Subjects in the HL Population were exposed to pembrolizumab for a median of 5.82 months (range: 0.03 to 
24.05) with a median of 9 administrations (range: 1 to 52), compared with a median of 4.17 months (range: 
0.03 to 30.39) and a median of 7 administrations (range: 1 to 59) in the Reference Population.  Of the 241 
subjects in the HL Population, 214 (88.8%) remained on pembrolizumab for ≥ 3 months and 117 (48.5%) 
remained on pembrolizumab for ≥ 6 months; 11 (4.6%) were exposed to pembrolizumab for ≥ 12 months. In 
comparison, 1656 of 2799 (59.2%) subjects in the Reference Population remained on pembrolizumab for ≥ 3 
months and 1153 (41.2%) remained on pembrolizumab for ≥ 6 months; 600 (21.4%) remained on 
pembrolizumab for ≥ 12 months.

Table 36: Exposure by Duration (APaT Population) 
In the Indication cHL Population, the most common reason for discontinuation of pembrolizumab treatment was 
disease progression. 4 % of subjects discontinued treatment because of study drug toxicity. At the time of 
database lock, 69% of subjects remained on treatment in KN087and 25.9 of subjects in KN013.  
Adverse events 
Summary of adverse events 
Table 2.4.3 summarizes AEs in the APaT population.  
In general, pembrolizumab was well tolerated among subjects with HL. Most AEs were of low-grade toxicity as 
evidenced by the lower rate of subjects with AEs categorized as Grade 3, 4, or 5, regardless of causality in the

241-subject HL Population (56 [23.2%]) compared with the reference population [Table 2.7.4: 7]. 
Among subjects with HL, 231 (95.9%) reported at least 1 AE regardless of causality, compared to 2727 of 2799 
(97.4%) subjects in the Reference Population. Regardless of AE category (eg, drug-related AEs, AEs categorized 
as Grade 3, 4, or 5, drug-related AEs categorized as Grade 3, 4, or 5, SAEs, drug-related SAEs, deaths, and 
discontinuations due to drug-related AEs or drug-related SAEs), the results reported among subjects with HL 
remained consistent with the Reference Population. Based on the AE summary, there was no change in the 
safety profile of pembrolizumab with the addition of new AE data from subjects with HL.

Drug-related Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of drug-related SAEs that occurred up to 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab was 
generally comparable between subjects in the HL and Reference Population. In the HL Population, drug-related 
SAEs occurred in 13 of 241 (5.4%) subjects, the most common of which was pneumonitis (4 [1.7%]). In 
comparison, 281 of 2799 (10.0%) subjects in the Reference Population had a drug-related SAE, the most 
common of which was also pneumonitis (44 [1.6%]). 
Deaths due to adverse events 
The incidence of deaths in the HL Population was low and comparable to that of the Reference Population]. In the 
HL population, deaths occurred in 2 of 241 (0.8%) subjects, neither of which was classified as drug related by 
the  investigator;  both  deaths  occurred  in  KEYNOTE-087.  One  (0.4%)  subject  died  as  a  result  of 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after a donor (allogeneic) stem-cell transplant and 1 (0.4%) subject died as 
a result of septic shock. In comparison, 110 of 2799 (3.9%) subjects died in the Reference Population, and 10

(0.4%) of these deaths were drug related 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
The analysis of AEOSI was the primary method of assessing immune-related AEs (irAEs) for this study and was 
based on a compiled list of preferred AE terms potentially associated with an immune etiology. The Sponsor 
developed this pre-specified list of terms representing potentially irAEs to consistently evaluate potential irAEs 
across several System Organ Classes. The AEOSI are presented regardless of Investigator-assessed causality 
and generally include all AE grades (with the exception of severe skin reactions). In an attempt to capture all 
informative data, the list of terms is intentionally broad; consequently, some reported terms may not have an 
obvious immune mechanism. The list of terms is updated periodically based on emerging pembrolizumab safety 
data.  
Summary of Adverse Event of Special Interest  
Table 2.4.9 displays the summary of AEOSI in the APaT population. The incidence of AEOSI among subjects in 
the HL Population was comparable to the Reference Population regardless of AEOSI category (eg, drug-related 
AEs, AEs categorized as Grade 3, 4, or 5, drug-related AEs categorized as Grade 3, 4, or 5, SAEs, drug-related 
SAEs, deaths, and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs or drug-related SAEs)A majority of these events 
were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, as only 2,5% of pembrolizumab-treated subjects experienced Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI. 
There were no deaths reported due to AEOSI in either treatment group. Seven (2.9%) subjects discontinued due 
to drug-related AEOSI.

Hypothyroidism  was  the  most  commonly  reported  AEOSI  among  subjects  in  the  HL  Population  across 
KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087 (12.9%). All events were low grade (Grade 1 or 2) [Table 5.3.5.3.3-hl: 92], 
and  no  subject  received  corticosteroid  treatment.  In  comparison,  237  of  2799  (8.5%)  of  subjects  in  the 
Reference Population experienced at least 1 episode of  hypothyroidism, 5 (0.2%) of  which were considered 
SAEs. 
Grade 1 to 4 pneumonitis was observed in 10 (4.1%) subjects.

subjects with infusion reactions were in KEYNOTE-087. Of the infusion reactions reported, 1 (0.4%) was 
categorized as Grade 3and considered serious and drug- related, resulting in discontinuation of pembrolizumab. 
The median time to onset of an infusion reaction episode was 1 day (range: 1 to 240) The majority of infusion 
reactions were low grade (Grade 1 or 2); no one died of an infusion reaction Few infusion reactions were 
managed with corticosteroids among subjects with HL and all infusion reactions resolved.

Laboratory findings 
To assess whether laboratory abnormalities represented clinically meaningful changes from baseline, an 
analysis of the shifts from baseline in the CTCAE grades of laboratory abnormalities (based on the highest CTCAE 
grade for a given laboratory test during the study) was performed. A clinically meaningful worsening in CTCAE 
Grade was defined as a shift from less than Grade 3 to Grade 3, 4, or 5; or a shift from Grade 0 to Grade 2. 
Clinically meaningful worsening in laboratory CTCAE grades was comparable between subjects in the HL 
Population and the Reference Population. In the HL Population, the laboratory abnormalities with the most 
frequent (incidence > 10%), clinically meaningful worsening in CTCAE grade, included phosphate decreased (46 
[19.1%]), lymphocytes decreased (31 [12.9%]), and neutrophils decreased (31 [12.9%])

Complications Following Post-allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT)  
Of the 31 subjects in KEYNOTE-013, 11 (35%) were reported as having received an allogeneic SCT at some point 
after stopping treatment with pembrolizumab. Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects experienced a drug-related SAE 
of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver following transplant; in 1 subject the event was fatal, and the other 
subject recovered. No hyperacute GVHD has been reported. As of the database cutoff date of 03-Jun-2016, 9 of 
the 11 subjects were known to be alive; 1 died due to VOD and 1 was lost to follow-up. The median follow-up 
duration from date of allogeneic SCT to death or last date the subject was known to be alive for these 11 subjects 
was 13.4 months (range: 0.7 to 20.2 months). 
Of the 210 subjects in KEYNOTE-087, 6 (3%) were reported as having received allogeneic SCT at some point 
after stopping treatment with pembrolizumab. 
ASCT-naive Subjects 
In  KN-087  Cohort  2,  81  patients  were  ASCT  naive.  Drug-related  AEs  were  reported  in  a  total  of  47  (58%) 
subjects, and Drug-Related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events were reported in  7 ( 8.6%) of the ASCT naïve subjects.  
This is comparable to the Indication Population.

Data on safety of DDIs or other interactions were not submitted in support of this application. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  pembrolizumab  interruption  were  pneumonitis  (5  [2.1%]),  diarrhea  (4 
[1.7%]), and alanine aminotransferase increased (3 [1.2%])

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
An analysis of subjects with drug-related AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation is presented in Table 2.4.17. 
The incidence of drug-related AEs that resulted in discontinuation of pembrolizumab was comparable between 
the HL and Reference Population. Among subject with HL, 10 of 241 (4.1%) discontinued pembrolizumab due to 
a  drug-related  AE.  The  most  common  drug-related  AE  leading  to  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  was 
pneumonitis (2.1%).

Immunogenicity 
According to the study protocol anti-pembrolizumab antibody (ADA) samples in study KN087 were collected at 
Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and every 4 cycles thereafter, 30 days after discontinuation of study drug and 3 months after 
Assessment report

discontinuation of study drug (or until the subject starts new anti-cancer therapy). In study KN013, ADA 
samples were drawn at pre-dose trough and post-dose peak at Cycles 1 and 2. Pre-dose samples only were 
collected at Cycle 4, Cycle 7, every 6 cycles thereafter, 30 days after discontinuation of study drug, and 3 
months and 6 months after discontinuation of study drug. 
An integrated immunogenicity evaluation has been performed across data from studies KN001, KN002, KN006, 
KN010, KN012, KN013, KN024, KN052, KN055, KN087 and KN164. A total of 3268 subjects were assessed in 
this evaluation: 1535 melanoma subjects, 1237 NSCLC subjects, 101 HNSCC, 121 UC, 54 MSI-H and 220 HL 
subjects, and the immunogenicity status is presented in Table 5. 
The overall immunogenicity incidence was defined as the proportion of treatment emergent positive subjects to 
the total number of evaluable subjects (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment emergent positive and 
negative immunogenicity status). Out of 3268 subjects included in the immunogenicity assessment, 1619 
subjects were evaluable. The observed incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects based on a 
pooled analysis of Melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, UC, MSI-H and HL subjects is 1.8% (29 out of 1619), based on 29 
subjects with confirmed treatment emergent positive status, relative to all evaluable subjects including 29 with 
treatment emergent positive, 16 with non-treatment emergent positive and 1574 with negative immunogenicity 
status. 
The subjects (N=29) with a treatment emergent immunogenicity response were evaluated for potential impact 
on exposure, safety and efficacy. Pembrolizumab exposure for these treatment emergent subjects were in the 
range of exposures observed for other subjects who were treated with pembrolizumab in the same regimen that 
only have ADA negative or ADA inconclusive samples. Therefore, exposure to pembrolizumab was not 
compromised by the observed immune response. The treatment emergent positive subjects did not have any 
adverse events associated with neutralizing antibodies, such as hypersensitivity events (e.g. anaphylaxis, 
urticaria, angioedema) or injection site reactions. No clinically significant impact on efficacy (i.e. tumour size 
change) was found. 
Furthermore, the immunogenicity evaluation was stratified by treatments (2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, 10 
mg/kg Q2W, or 200 mg) or indications (Melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, UC, MSI-H and HL subjects). The incidence 
of treatment emergent ADA was low (less than 2.8%) for all different stratifications used (dose levels or 
indication). In the subgroup of HL subjects, 1 out of 182 evaluable subjects (179 negative, 2 non-treatment 
emergent positive and 1 treatment emergent positive) had treatment emergent ADA yielding an incidence rate 
for treatment emergent antibodies of 0.5%.  
The percentage of subjects with the final sample below the drug tolerance level of the ADA screening assay was 
determined (Table 5). At the dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose 
sample was below the drug tolerance level for 80.6% of the subjects. At the dosing regimen of 200 mg fixed 
dose, 95.0% of the subjects had a pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose sample below the drug 
tolerance level. Among HL patients only, 38 out of 220 (17 %) subjects were inconclusive.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Results  from  the  overall  241  patients  treated  in  study  KEYNOTE-013  (31  patients)  and  210  patients 
KEYNOTE-087  have  been  presented  to  support  the  clinical  safety  of  pembrolizumab  in  classical  Hodgkin 
Lymphoma population. In parallel, safety data in the Reference Population (overall 2799 NSCLC and melanoma 
patients from studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), are discussed in order 
to allow a comparison with the already established pembrolizumab safety profile reported in the melanoma and 
NSCLC patients. Furthermore, safety data  have been provided by comparison from the Cumulative Running 
Population in a total of 3475 patients, including, besides HL and Reference Populations, additional patients with 
different cancer types treated with pembrolizumab across the ongoing studies KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and B2 
(head and neck cancer), KEYNOTE-016 Cohort A (colorectal cancer), KEYNOTE-024 (NSCLC), and KEYNOTE-164 
(colorectal carcinoma). 
In line with the Hodgkin Lymphoma characteristic epidemiology, the population is overall younger compared to 
Reference and Current Cumulative Datasets, with a median age of 35 years vs 62 and 61, respectively.  
An updated safety analysis with approximately 3 months of additional follow-up for KEYNOTE-087 (cutoff date 
25 Sep 2016) and 3.8 months for KEYNOTE-013 (cutoff date 27 Sep 2016) has been provided. No major changes 
to the pembrolizumab safety profile in cHL population were reported.In terms of exposure to pembrolizumab, a 
longer median time on therapy was reported for HL patients compared to Reference Population and Cumulative 
Running Population (8.28 months vs 4.17 and 4.83 months), with a higher number of dose administered ( 13 vs 
7 and 8). Overall, 70% of HL population (128 patients) were exposed to pembrolizumab for at least 6 months. 
However, long-term (≥12 months) safety profile is still based on limited data (26 patients in total). 
Overall, no major differences are reported compared to the larger safety datasets, with even a lower frequency 
in HL patients for some AE categories, such as drug-related AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs and discontinuation due 
to AEs. In general, the pembrolizumab safety profile was consistent with what previously reported and to that 
current cumulative. Indeed, with the exception of pyrexia, that is twice as frequent in HL population compared 
to reference safety dataset (24.1% vs 12.8%), the incidence of characteristic AEs is similar or even lower in HL 
population. In particular, Diarrhea (19.9%), Fatigue (19.9%), Nausea ( 14.9%), Pruritus (12.9 %), Rash (12 %) 
and Arthralgia (10.8%) were reported.  
In terms of drug-related AEs, a higher rate was reported in HL patients for hypothyroidism (12.4% vs 7.6% and 
7.9%, in the Reference and Cumulative Datasets respectively) and pyrexia (9.1% vs 4.5% and 5.2%, in the 
Reference and Cumulative Datasets respectively). However, the higher frequency of hypothyroidism could be 
justified by prior RT to the neck and/or mediastinum (in 36.9% of HL patients), while for pyrexia it should be 
taken into consideration that fever is part of the know B symptoms of Hodgkin Lymphoma. 
The rate of SAEs was lower in HL patients compared to larger safety database (18.7% vs 37.2% in Reference 
dataset  and  36.5%  in  Cumulative  Running  Dataset).  SAEs  by  PT  were  consistent  across  population,  with 
Pneumonia, Pneumonitis and Pyrexia most frequently reported (incidence ≥1%). 
The  incidence  of  AEOSI  in  the  HL  population  has  been  reported  as  comparable  to  that  in  the  Reference 
population  and  in  the  Cumulative  dataset.  Hypothyroidism  was  the  most  frequently  observed  AEOSI  across 
populations. The higher rate of events in HL patients, as well as the shorter time to onset of first Hypothyroidism 
event, can be justified by the prior exposure to radiation therapy. A higher rate of Infusion related reactions was 
observed in HL population (8.3%) than in Reference Safety Dataset (2.5%) and Cumulative Running Safety 
Dataset (2.7%), though the majority of events did not require corticosteroid treatment.  
Overall, 4 fatal cases occurred in HL patients, all in study KN087, two were related to AEs (1 Graft-versus-host 
Assessment report

Page 86/102 
 
  
  
disease (GVHD) and 1 septic shock), and the remaining 2 patients died due to disease progression. 
Hepatic  veno-occlusive  disease  (VOD)  and  severe  GVHD  as  complication  of  allogenic  SCT,  including  fatal 
reports, were reported in patients previously treated with anti PD-1 agents.  
Overall, 23 patients treated with pembrolizumab (10 in KN087 and 13 in KN013) received thereafter an allogenic 
SCT. In total, complications were experienced by 7 patients with 2 drug-related SAE of veno-occlusive disease, 
including 1 fatal case, and 6 reports of GvHD, including 1 fatal case.  
Even  though  data  on  the  feasibility  of  allogenic  SCT  after  pembrolizumab  are  still  limited,  considering  the 
immunomodulatory  mechanism  and  the  prolonged  clinical  activity  possibly  enhancing  the  allogeneic  T-cell 
responses, it is agreed with the MAH that the increased risk of severe complications of allogeneic SCT is a new 
safety concern to be considered as an Important Potential Risk of pembrolizumab. A warning on the potential 
risk of severe complications from allogenic SCT in patients previously treated with pembrolizumab should be 
added in Section 4.4 and reported events should be listed in Section 4.8. The pembrolizumab contribution to the 
frequency and the nature of these events will be clarified by information on complications from allogenic SCT 
performed within 2 years of pembrolizumab last dose collected in the ongoing study KN-204, directly comparing 
pembrolizumab and brentuximab in rr-HL.  
Changes in laboratory findings in HL population were in line with those reported in the larger dataset. 
No major and unexpected differences in the tolerability of pembrolizumab treatment were observed across the 
different class of age, ECOG PS categories, and gender.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab in HL population is in line with that reported in melanoma and 
NSCLC patients. The increased risk of severe complications of allogeneic SCT in previously treated 
pembrolizumab patients was a newly identified safety concern. 
In order to further investigate the long-term safety in this population, in particular considering the recognized 
risk of exacerbating GVHD related to checkpoint inhibition, updated safety data will be provided.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
The final CSR of studies KN-087 and KN-013, also including long-term safety data should be provided 
post-approval.

With the proposed extension of indication to cHL, one newly identified important potential risk has been added 
to the RMP concerning an increased risk of severe complications of allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 
patients who have previously received pembrolizumab.  
Having considered the updated data in the safety specification, the safety concerns listed in the RMP by the MAH 
is considered appropriate.

For the newly included safety concern regarding severe complications following allogenic SCT in patients who 
previously received pembrolizumab, the MAH proposes to monitor the risk in the ongoing Hodgkin Lymphoma 
trials P013, P087 and P204, which is considered acceptable.  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
Particularly, a new warning with regard to complications of allogeneic stem cell transplant in cHL has been added

to the product information section 4.4. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a B cell lymphoma with distinct clinic and biologic features; it accounts for 
approximately 10% of all lymphomas and 0.6% of all cancers. The incidence in Europe is approximately 2.4 
cases per 100.000 persons, and presents a characteristic bimodal age distribution curve, with one peak in young 
adults (median age of onset 20 years) and one in older adults (median age of onset 65 years). Overall, the 
majority of patients are young adults, with a slightly higher prevalence in males. However, the actual incidence 
pattern is known to vary according to race and region. 
From a histological point of view, cHL is characterised by the presence of the pathognomonic Reed-Sternberg 
(RS) cells in the context of a mixed inflammatory background. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands, PD-L1 and 
PD-L2,  frequently  responsible  of  cancer  cell  evasion  of  immune  surveillance,  have  been  shown  to  be 
over-expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells. 
cHL  is  usually  characterized  by  a  high  sensitivity  to  chemotherapy  and  considered  a  highly  curable 
lymphoproliferative  disease.  However  and  despite  aggressive  treatment  plans,  also  including  salvage  and 
consolidation  therapy,  approximately  50%  of  the  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  disease  will  not  achieve 
long-term disease control.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Choice of treatment in cHL is based on disease stage and the presence/absence of known risk factors. Most 
patients are able to attain disease remission with upfront combination chemotherapy (e.g. ABVD, BEACOPP or 
STANFORD-V regimens) ± involved-field radiation therapy. However, 10 to 40% of patients  will experience 
relapse  or  will  be  refractory  to  the  initial therapy.    Salvage  therapy,  currently  based  on  non  cross-resistant 
chemotherapy regimens (i.e. DHAP, IGeV, GemOX, ICE etc.), can obtain responses in approximately 50% of 
relapsed/refractory (r/r) patients. Unfortunately, at this stage, long-term disease control following conventional 
therapy alone is uncommon and further consolidation is needed. Fit patients are usually candidate to high dose 
chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (ASCT). The long-term prognosis of 
patients  not  eligible  ASCT,  or  who  have  failed  ASCT,  is  poor,  with  a  three-year  OS  of  approximately  30%. 
Brentuximab  vedotin  (BV),  a  CD30-directed  antibody  linked  to  an  anti-tubulin  agent  (MMAE),  is  currently 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with r/r cHL following ASCT, or at least two prior therapies when 
ASCT is not a treatment option. Prognosis after failure of BV is poor. A selected subset of patients might be 
eligible  to  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  (allo-HSCT),  which  might  still  result  in  long-term 
remission. However, transplant-related mortality and toxicity is not negligible. Other treatment options (i.e. 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 95/102 
 
  
  
lenalidomide, everolimus etc.) should still be considered experimental and do not appear to be associated with 
long-term clinical benefit. 
A clear unmet medical need is therefore evident for relapsed or refractory cHL patients who have failed both 
ASCT and BV.  Programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands, have been shown to be over-expressed in cHL, making PD-1 
an  attractive  target.  In  this  regard,  the  CHMP  has  recently  granted  a  positive  opinion  for  nivolumab,  an 
anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of adult patients with r/r cHL after ASCT and treatment with 
BV.    
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal  trial  KEYNOTE-087  is  a  multi-center,  single-arm,  multi-cohort,  non-randomized  Phase  2  trial 
investigating pembrolizumab (200mg Q3W) efficacy (primary endpoint ORR) and safety in 210 patients with r/r 
cHL who were: refractory to /relapsed  after ASCT and BV received after transplantation (Cohort 1); refractory 
to salvage chemotherapy, ASCT naïve, refractory to /relapsed after BV (Cohort 2); refractory to/relapsed after 
ASCT, naïve to BV post-transplantation but who could have received BV as part of primary treatment, or salvage 
treatment (Cohort 3). 
Supportive study KEYNOTE-013 is a multicenter, multi-cohort phase 1b trial to determine the safety and efficacy 
of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg Q2W) in subjects with haematological malignancies. Efficacy (primary endpoint 
CRR) and safety data come from Cohort 3 (n=31) which included subjects with r/r nodular sclerosing or mixed 
cellularity cHL that had failed, were ineligible for, or refused ASCT and had relapsed after treatment with (or 
failed to respond to) BV.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In pivotal study (KEYNOTE-087), the ORR per BICR in the ASaT population (primary endpoint) at the time of the 
latest data cut-off date was 69% (145/210; 95% CI: 62.3%, 75.2%), and CRR 22.4% (47/210, 95% CI 16.9%, 
28.6%).  
ORRs by central review were 73.9%, 64.2% and 70% and CRRs were 21.7%, 24.7% and 20% in Cohorts 1, 2 
and 3 respectively. 
An  ORR  ranging  between  65%  and  70%  was  observed  in  patients  already  exposed  to  BV  with  few  or  none 
recognized alternatives (i.e. patients in Cohorts 1 and 2). With a 10.1 months median follow-up median DOR and 
PFS in the ASaT population by BICR were 11.1 and 11.3 months, respectively). By Kaplan-Meier estimation, 
6-month DOR and 6-month PFS rates were 75.6% and 72.4 %, respectively. PFS and DOR results across the 3 
Cohorts were also consistent with those observed in the overall ASaT population. 
In study KEYNOTE-013 ORR according to BICR was 58% (18/31). CRR by BICR (19.4%) was similar to that 
observed in the pivotal study. With a significantly longer follow-up of 28.7 months compared to the pivotal trial, 
median  DOR  was  not  reached  (95%  CI  3.7  months,  NR),  7  patients  out  of  18  responders  had  a  response 
duration of at least 12 months, median PFS per BICR was 11.4 months and the 12-month PFS rate was 48.2%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Pivotal study KEYNOTE-087 was a single-arm, uncontrolled study. While for Cohorts 1 and 2 the absence of an 
adequate comparator can be justified by the lack of standard alternatives for r/r cHL patients who have failed 
both ASCT and BV, this is not applicable to Cohort 3, in which 60% of patients were BV naïve. Therefore an 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 96/102 
 
  
  
indication on BV naïve patients cannot be supported as the clinical relevance in this case is questionable; the 
proposed indication was revised not to include this patient population. A phase 3 study KEYNOTE-204 comparing 
pembrolizumab and BV in rr cHL patients is at present ongoing (see RMP). 
The indication also includes patients ineligible to ASCT due reasons other than chemoresistance. Apart from 
chemoresistance, transplant ineligibility is usually determined by age and comorbidities. In this regard, only 18 
patients were aged ≥ 65 years in pivotal study KN-087 and the activity of pembrolizumab in this subpopulation 
(ORR 50%) seems to be somehow reduced compared to younger subjects (ORR 71%). Similarly, with all the 
limits of looking at performance status as a surrogate measure of comorbidity, median DOR and PFS appear to 
be slightly reduced in patients with ECOG score ≥1 vs. ECOG score 0. However, although only 5 patients not 
eligible to ASCT due to reasons other than chemo-refractoriness to salvage therapy received pembrolizumab in 
pivotal study KN-087 (unplanned protocol deviations), the results observed in this small subset are nonetheless 
encouraging (2 CR, 1 PR). Further, the high unmet need and the absence of effective alternatives for patients 
with  r/r  cHL  who  have  failed  BV  and  are  ineligible  to  ASCT  due  to  reasons  other  than  failure  of  salvage 
chemotherapy  are  acknowledged.  Therefore,  also  in  light  of  the  overall  favourable  toxicity  profile  of 
pembrolizumab, the indication is considered appropriate. 
The provided PFS analysis is largely immature, with 70 out of 210 patients having experienced an event . OS 
data from both studies KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013 is also immature. At the time of the most recent data 
cut-off date, the median follow-up in study KEYNOTE-087 was 10.1 months. In order to fully capture long-term 
clinical benefit with pembrolizumab the MAH will submit the final CSRs from these studies (See Annex II and 
RMP).  
Information on other planned secondary/exploratory endpoints and in particular, data regarding response rates 
by  BICR  using  the  5-point  scale  according  to  the  Lugano  Classification  and  the  analyses  investigating  the 
relationship between biomarkers and response to pembrolizumab will only be available in the final CSR for study 
KN-087 (See Annex II and RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Drug-related AEs were reported in 65.6% of  HL patients across study KN087 and KN013, with drug-related 
Grade ≥3 AEs affecting 10% of them.  
The  most  commonly  observed  drug-related  AEs  were  Hypothyroidism  (10.8%),  Pyrexia  (9.5%),  Diarrhea 
(8.3%), Fatigue (7.1%) and Nausea (6.6%).  
Grade  ≥3  drug-related  AEs  were  mainly  observed  in  SOCs  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (2.1%), 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.1%), Gastrointestinal disorders (1.7%) and Infections and 
infestations (1.7%). 
The incidence of serious drug-related AEs was 5.4%, with pneumonitis as the most frequently occurred (1.7%). 
Among  AEOSI,  Hypothyroidism  was  reported  at the  higher  frequency,  affecting  12.9%  of  patients,  with  the 
event considered not resolved in 5.8% of them. 
Complications to allogenic HSCT (i.e, VOD and GVHD) were experienced in 3 of the 17 pembrolizumab treated 
patients  who  receive  transplantation  after  progression,  and  a  fatal  outcome  was  reported  in  2  of  them.  All 
Adverse drug reactions and revised frequencies of already reported ones are reflected in the SmPC section 4.8. 
A new warning was added under section 4.4 of the SmPC on complications of allogeneic haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after pembrolizumab. Patients should be followed closely for early evidence of 
transplant-related complications, such as hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), severe (grade 3 to 4) 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 97/102 
 
  
  
acute  GVHD,  steroid-requiring  febrile  syndrome,  hepatic  veno-occlusive  disease  (VOD),  and  other 
immune-mediated adverse reactions (See SmPC and RMP). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, 70% of HL population (128 patients) were exposed to pembrolizumab for at least 6 months. However, 
long-term (≥12 months) safety profile is still based on limited data (26 patients in total). The final CSRs from 
studies 087 and 013 will provide additional data on long term safety (See Annex II and RMP). 
Data on the feasibility of allogenic HSCT after pembrolizumab are still limited. The safety of allogeneic HSCT 
after pembrolizumab therapy will be further studied in KEYNOTE 204 (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The overall ORR ranging between 64% and 73.9% observed across studies in heavily pretreated subjects is 
considered clinically meaningful. A high degree of inter internal consistency in response rates was observed 
across all cohorts and subgroups of study KEYNOTE-087 whereas the responses durable, even in this advanced 
setting  of  disease.  In  this  regard,  the  24.7%  CRR  observed  in  Cohort  2  (i.e.  patients  ineligible  to  ASCT)  is 
considered of particular clinical relevance: since CR before transplant is known to affect both DFS and OS post 
ASCT  (see  e.g.  Sureda  A.  et  al.,  JCO  2001),  transplant  eligibility  is  dependent  on  the  possibility  to  achieve 
pre-transplant remission. Achieving CR with pembrolizumab aims to restore transplant eligibility (with all the 
significant implications on long-term disease control) to those patients with persistent disease after failure of 
salvage therapy and BV. The efficacy of pembrolizumab is not influenced by disease status (relapsed, refractory 
or  primary  refractory),  number  of  prior  treatments  or  time  since  transplant  failure.  Of  note,  an  analysis 
conducted in 36 primary refractory subjects (i.e. patients refractory to first line therapy who never achieved a 
response to subsequent therapies) showed an ORR based on IWG criteria by BICR of 80.6% (29/36; 95% CI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017 
Page 99/102 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
64.0%,  91.8%),  with  a  25%  CRR  (9/36;  95%  CI:  12.1%,  42.2%).  Results  from  the  supportive  study 
KEYNOTE-013 were overall consistent with those observed in the pivotal study.  
Time-to-event data from the supportive study (with a significantly longer follow-up of 28.7 months) confirm that 
responses with pembrolizumab are durable, and overall the results were consistent with DOR data and PFS data 
from the pivotal study. Although overall favourable, results in terms of time-to-event endpoints are difficult to 
put  into  context  in  the  framework  of  an  uncontrolled  study  with  a  limited  median  follow-up  to  fully  capture 
long-term clinical benefit in terms of PFS and OS.  
Overall, 70% of HL population (169 patients) were exposed to pembrolizumab for at least 6 months, while safety 
data with treatment exposure ≥12 months are only available for 26 patients. No major differences are reported 
compared  to  the  larger  safety  datasets.  The  safety  profile  was  consistent  with  what  previously  reported. 
Drug-related AEs were mainly Grade 1-2 in severity.  
The higher rate of events in HL patients, as well as the shorter time to onset of first Hypothyroidism event, can 
be justified by the prior exposure to radiation therapy. A higher rate of Infusion related reactions was observed 
in  HL  population  (8.3%)  than  in  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (2.5%)  and  Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset 
(2.7%), though the majority of events did not require corticosteroid treatment. 
Complication from allogenic HSCT (including fatal cases) in patients previously treated with pembrolizumab was 
reported as a newly identified safety concern to be considered as an Important Potential Risk of pembrolizumab. 
The  contribution  of  pembrolizumab  to  the  frequency  and  the  nature  of  these  events  will  be  clarified  by 
information on complications from allogenic SCT performed within 2 years of pembrolizumab last dose collected 
in the ongoing study KN-204, directly comparing pembrolizumab and brentuximab in rr-HL. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall ORR observed across studies in heavily pretreated subjects is considered clinically meaningful. In 
particular, in patients already exposed to BV with few or none recognized alternatives (i.e. patients in Cohorts 1 
and 2) the lack of a comparative arm is acceptable, the reported ORR, ROR and PFS are deemed meaningful. 
Further, since CR is a key factor for transplant eligibility, the observed CRR in cohort 2 is regarded as potential 
added value.  
Overall, pembrolizumab safety profile was consistent with that previously reported in the larger safety datasets, 
with even a lower frequency in HL patients for some AE categories.  
A warning in Section 4.4 has been added and information on potential complications of allogenic Haematopoietic 
Stem  Cell  Transplantation  (HSCT)  will  be  included  in  the  Educational  Material.  The  contribution  of 
pembrolizumab to the frequency and the nature of these events will be clarified by information on complications 
from allogenic SCT performed within 2 years of pembrolizumab last dose collected in the ongoing study KN-204, 
directly comparing pembrolizumab and brentuximab in rr-HL. 
The  final  CSR  of  PAES  studies  KN-087  and  KN-013,  and  randomised  PAES  study  KN-204  -  also  including 
long-term safety data will be provided post-approval.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
There is a need to investigate the long term efficacy of pembrolizumab discontinuation due to maintained CR and 
relevant  strategies  will  be  proposed  by  the  MAH.  Additional  information  about  the  long  term  efficacy  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/252426/2017

pembrolizumab in CR subjects (including subjects who have discontinued pembrolizumab) will be included in the 
final CSRs for KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-204 -both PAES (as stated in the RMP and Annex II). 
Efficacy  in  subjects  who  have  transplantation  following  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  will  also  be  further 
investigated and additional data will be provided with the CSR for the PAES KEYNOTE-204 (see Annex II and 
RMP).  Subjects in both treatments arms who achieve CR or PR and discontinue study treatment to receive SCT 
will continue to be followed in the trial. Disease assessments will be conducted every 12 week until disease 
progression. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit /Risk of Keytruda, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and 
brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV - is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy and safety:

Extension of Indication to include monotherapy treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and brentuximab vedotin 
(BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV, based on the results from study KEYNOTE-087, an 
open-label Phase II trial of pembrolizumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL and study KEYNOTE-013, 
a Phase Ib multi-cohort trial of pembrolizumab in subjects with haematologic malignancies. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
For the newly included safety concern regarding severe complications following allogenic SCT in patients who 
previously received pembrolizumab, the following additional risk minimisation measure has been introduced: 
-The below key element has been added to the healthcare professional FAQ Brochure: 
Potential risk of “Severe complications of allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients who have 
previously received pembrolizumab for haematologic malignancies” 
-The below key element has been added to the patient information brochure and patient alert card: 
Information that patients treated with pembrolizumab who then go on to stem cell transplant that 
uses donor cells (allogenic) can experience transplant complications, that can be severe and can 
lead to death, and that their doctor will monitor them for these complications. These patients 
should inform their transplant physicians that they have received pembrolizumab in the past.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
1. 
Submission of the dossier 
The  Applicant  Tercica  Europe  Ltd.  submitted  on  7  December  2005  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  INCRELEX,  through  the  centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application 
The  application  submitted  is  a  complete  dossier  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete 
quality  data,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  Applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or 
bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
INCRELEX  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/06/373  on  22  May  2006. 
INCRELEX was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment of 
primary  insulin-like  growth  factor-1  deficiency  due  to  molecular  or  genetic  defects.  The  calculated 
prevalence  of  this  condition  was  less  than  2  per  10.000  EU  population.  INCRELEX  was  also 
designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/05/307  on  26  August  2005  in  the  following 
indication: Treatment of primary growth hormone insensitivity syndrome. The calculated prevalence 
of this condition was not more than 1 in 10,000 EU population. 
The Applicant applied for the following indication: 
For  the  long-term  treatment  of  growth  failure  in  children  with  severe  Primary  insulin-like  growth 
factor-1 deficiency (Primary IGFD) or with growth hormone (GH) gene deletion who have developed 
neutralizing antibodies to GH. 
Severe Primary IGFD is defined by: 
•  height standard deviation score ≤ –3.0 and 
•  basal IGF-1 levels below the age- and gender-specific normal range and 
•  normal or elevated GH. 
Severe Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling 
pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected to 
respond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. 
INCRELEX is not intended for use in subjects with secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as GH 
deficiency,  malnutrition,  hypothyroidism,  or  chronic  treatment  with  pharmacologic  doses  of  anti-
inflammatory  steroids.  Thyroid  and  nutritional  deficiencies  should  be  corrected  before  initiating 
INCRELEX treatment. 
INCRELEX is not a substitute for GH treatment

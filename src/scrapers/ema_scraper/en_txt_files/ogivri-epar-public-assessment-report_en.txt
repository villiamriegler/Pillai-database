2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
Trastuzumab is a humanized recombinant IgG monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the HER2 
receptor. Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of 
HER2’s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and 
prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a result, 
trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour 
cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially 
exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is currently authorised for the treatment of breast cancer and gastric cancer. Herceptin 
is available as a 150 mg Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous (IV) use and as a 600 
mg Solution for injection (SC) for subcutaneous use. 
The applicant’s trastuzumab (Ogivri) has been developed as a biosimilar product to Herceptin which is the 
reference product in this application. The claimed indications are the same as the ones approved for the 
reference product Herceptin:

Ogivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Ogivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): 
• 
•

• 
• 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Ogivri therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Ogivri should only be used in patients with metastatic or EBC whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression 
or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Ogivri in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have 
not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Ogivri should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. Accurate 
and validated assay methods should be used (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The posology and method of administration are the same as the ones approved for Herceptin 150 mg powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion. The applicant did not claim subcutaneous use. 
Ogivri is for intravenous infusion and contains 150 mg of trastuzumab as a lyophilized powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. In addition to the drug substance, the formulation contains L-histidine hydrochloride and 
L-histidine, sorbitol and Macrogol 3350. The formulation is identical to the reference medicinal product with the 
exception of the substitution of sorbitol for α-trehalose dehydrate, and Macrogol 3350 for polysorbate-20. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is submitted under Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC relating to applications for biosimilar 
medicinal products. This is an application for a biosimilar trastuzumab. The reference product is Herceptin (150 
mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion; Roche Registration Limited). Herceptin was authorised in 
the EU on 28 August 2000. 
The clinical programme was initiated with the aim to show biosimilarity between both products in the setting of 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and extrapolating similarity to the other indications in case biosimilarity was 
confirmed in MBC in regards to quality, non-clinical, PK, pharmacodynamic and clinical aspects. 
CHMP scientific advice was given on quality, nonclinical and clinical development. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

Other  ingredients  are:  histidine  hydrochloride,  histidine,  sorbitol,  macrogol  3350,  hydrochloric  acid  (for  pH 
adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment). The product is available in a 15 mL clear glass type I 
vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The  active  substance  (INN:  trastuzumab)  is  a  recombinant  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)-derived  humanized 
monoclonal antibody directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). It belongs to the 
immunoglobulin  G  subclass  1  kappa 
isotype  and  contains  human 
framework  regions  with  the 
complementary-determining regions of a murine antibody (4D5) that binds to HER2. 
Trastuzumab  consists  of  1328  amino  acids  and  is  comprised  of  two  identical  heavy  chains  (HCs)  and  two 
identical light chains (LCs). Each HC is comprised of 450 amino acid residues and each LC is comprised of 214 
amino acids. The HCs are fully glycosylated at Asn300. 
The formulated bulk active substance is a clear to slightly opalescent non-turbid liquid. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The facility responsible for the manufacture and testing of the active substance is Biocon Limited, Plot No. 2-5, 
Phase IV, Bommasandra-Jigani Link Road, Bangalore, India. 
The active substance is manufactured using a fed-batch process in a production bioreactor. Following cell culture 
and  harvest,  active  substance  is  purified  from  the  harvest  culture  fluid  through  a  series  of  filtration  and 
chromatography  steps.  The  process  includes  steps  to  inactivate/remove  potential  contaminating  viruses. 
Excipients are added to generate the formulated active substance.  
Process control classifications and acceptance ranges are considered acceptable. The process parameters are 
controlled by acceptable ranges  
Control of materials 
Raw  materials  are  sufficiently  described  and  controlled.  The  details  regarding  the  origin  of  materials, 
pharmacopoeial  reference  or  internal  specification,  and  the  stage  of  the  manufacturing  process,  where  the 
material is used, are provided. 
Recombinant  CHO  cells  expressing  the  monoclonal  antibody  trastuzumab  were  established.  A  2-tiered  cell 
banking system of MCB and WCB was established and qualified. The MCB complies with ICH Q5A and Q5D. A 
post-production  cell  bank  (PPCB)  was  prepared  and  tested  for  identity,  purity,  and  contamination  by 
adventitious agents such bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and viruses according to ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D. Genetic 
stability up to and beyond the generation number needed for routine production was investigated. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Input  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  have  been  defined  during  process  characterization.  The  output 
attributes are classified into critical and non-critical output attributes. In-process controls (IPCs) are performed 
at each stage during the manufacture of active substance to ensure that the process is controlled. The definition 
of the critical IPCs along with justification for limits, are acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 12/128 
  
  
Process validation 
The  process  validation  (PV)  was  performed  on  three  full  scale  active  substance  batches.  The  batches  were 
manufactured using the final commercial process. The data demonstrate that the commercial process, when 
operated  within  the  specified  ranges,  consistently  produces  active  substance  that  meets  the  predetermined 
specification.  Clearance  of  process-related  impurities  has  been  found  to  be  consistent.  The  impurity  levels 
obtained at the end of the manufacturing process are considered acceptable. Overall the manufacturing process 
is considered appropriately validated. 
A hold time stability study was conducted to support the hold time of the in-process product pools. 
Chromatographic column resin reusability was evaluated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The process development, including several process versions, has been described. Changes introduced during 
development include scale up and process optimisations. The applicant has performed comparability studies 
(including verification of process performance, release test results, characterisation test results and stability test 
results) to show that batches from the different process versions can be considered as comparable. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation studies were performed to verify primary structure, disulphide bonds, higher order structure, 
glycosylation pattern, oxidation, purity and biological function of the active substance. 
The intact mass, reduced mass, N and C terminal analysis as well as > 95% coverage of the protein sequence 
by  peptide  mass  fingerprinting  using  two  endo-proteinases  demonstrated  that  the  active  substance  had  the 
expected primary structure.  
For  the  secondary  structure  analysis  and  tertiary,  while  a  direct  quantitative  measurement  of  the  structure 
aspect was possible only for Far-UV CD analysis, for other techniques comparison with the reference product 
Herceptin  was  used  a  tool  to  elucidate  the  structure  of  the  protein.  In  Far  UV-CD  analysis,  the  protein  was 
identified to be a predominant β sheet structure. From the UV profile of the disulphide and peptide map analysis, 
it could be ascertained that the disulphide linkages and the protein fold was in the correct orientation as verified 
by comparing with Herceptin. Similarity in free cysteine content added to this conclusion. The tertiary structure 
analysis was completely evaluated in comparison to Herceptin.  
Product-related  variants  like  high  molecular  weight  protein  (HMWP),  low  molecular  weight  protein  (LMWP), 
fragments, surface charge and net charge based were all analyzed with various techniques and it was found in 
all  cases  that  the  major  structural  form  was  the  intact  monoclonal  antibody  with  the  appropriate  molecular 
weight, surface and net charge.  
The glycoforms were found to be consistent from batch to batch and comparable with EU Herceptin. Also, the 
sialic acid was of the N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) type with no evidence of the N-glycolylneuraminic acid 
(NGNA) type being present. 
Functional analysis of the protein was performed by means of SKBr3 cell proliferation, HER2 binding kinetics, 
ADCC and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) analysis. In all the biological assays the activity was found 
to be comparable to the reference indicative of the fact that protein was structurally intact and in the required 
conformation. 
Levels of product-related impurities were very low and within acceptable limits.

Process-related impurities are controlled and/or removed at different steps of the purification process during 
manufacture  of  the  active  substance  Levels  of  process-related  impurities  were  very  low  due  to  efficient 
clearance by the process purification steps. 
Specification 
Specifications  are  set  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q6B  and  include  tests  for  appearance,  identity,  purity  and 
impurities,  content,  potency,  microbiological  safety  and  general  tests.  The  specifications  are  considered 
sufficient  in  order  to  control  the  quality  of  the  active  substance.  However,  some  of  the  limits  should  be 
re-assessed once release data from further commercial batches are available. Regarding afucosylated species, 
the lower limit has been revised to a level that can be considered as clinically qualified and representative of the 
normal EU Herceptin quality range.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for active substance testing have been described in detail. Potency is determined 
by cell proliferation and binding to HER-2 expressing cells.  
The  validation  of  the  analytical  methods  was  described  in  detail.  The  results  are  deemed  sufficient  and 
acceptable. Consequently, the methods are appropriately validated.  
Batch analysis 
The  applicant  has  provided  batch  data  for  several  active  substance  lots  from  different  versions  of  the 
manufacturing processes. 
Reference materials 
The  applicant  provided  detailed  information  on  the  current  and  previous  reference  standard  lots.  For 
qualification,  each  of  these  lots  was  extensively  tested  according  to  the  release  specifications  as  well  as  by 
additional  characterisation  testing.  For  future  internal  reference  standards  the  same  panel  of  release  and 
characterisation tests will be used for qualification. 
Container closure 
The formulated bulk active substance is stored in a Celsius-Pak bag. The container closure system was described 
and adequately qualified; leachables and extractables studies were performed. 
Stability 
Stability data have been provided for batches stored under long-term and accelerated storage conditions. The 
stability data provided for the different processes, show that all results were compliant with the specifications 
and no significant trending has been observed.  
The  stability  samples  were  stored  in  Celsius  bags  made  of  the  same  material  as  used  for  the  proposed 
commercial primary packaging. 
The  stability  data  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  24  months,  when  the  active  substance  is  stored  at  the 
recommended long-term storage condition.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is presented as 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and is supplied in 
a single use vial (15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film). The 
finished product is intended for reconstitution with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied with the 
pack)  to  yield  a  solution  containing  approximately  21  mg/mL  trastuzumab.  Other  ingredients  are  histidine 
hydrochloride, histidine, sorbitol, macrogol 3350, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide 
(for pH adjustment). 
There  is  no  overage  in  the  manufacturing  process.  An  overfill  of  4%  is  included  in  order  to  assure  that  the 
labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  was  focused  on  developing  a  formulation  that  was  highly  similar  to  the 
reference product, Herceptin, from a quality and stability perspective. The reference product contains trehalose 
dihydrate (which functions as a lyoprotectant, cryoprotectant, and bulking agent) and polysorbate 20 (which 
functions  as  a  surfactant).  To  circumvent  patent  protection,  macrogol  3350/PEG  3350  was  selected  as  an 
alternative cryoprotectant and D-sorbitol was selected as a lyoprotectant and bulking agent for Ogivri.  
Changes made to the finished product manufacturing process during the development have been described and 
aimed at improving control of the process, with no impact to the quality of the finished product. The comparative 
analytical data of the finished product used in the manufacture of Phase  I,  Phase III  and process validation 
batches were provided. 
The container closure system was described and adequately qualified; leachables and extractables studies were 
performed.  The  container  closure  system  for  the  finished  product  remained  unaltered  during  process 
development. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The facility responsible for manufacture and QC testing of the finished product is Biocon Limited, Plot Nos. 2, 3, 
4 & 5, Phase IV, Bommasandra-Jigani Link Road, Bangalore, India. The batch release site for EU is McDermott 
Laboratories T/A Mylan Dublin Biologics (Dublin, Ireland). 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  thawing  of  formulated  active  substance,  pooling  of  individual  active 
substance bags followed by mixing, pre-filtration, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilization, and sealing of 
vials  containing  the  lyophilized  product.  The  manufacturing  steps  have  been  appropriately  described.  The 
definition and classification of critical and non-critical process parameters is acceptable. The in-process controls 
and acceptance criteria have been described and found acceptable. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  three  consecutive  full  scale  production 
batches using the same manufacturing facilities, process and equipment as intended for commercial use. All 
process parameters as well as performance parameters monitored during the  process validation study were 
maintained  within  their  specified  ranges.  Based  on  the  data  provided,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  finished 
product manufacturing process is under control and can be considered as validated. 
The aseptic process used for the sterilization has been validated through media fills.

Product specification 
The release specification for the finished product includes tests for appearance, identity, purity and impurities, 
content, excipient, potency, determination of pH, general pharmacopeial tests, and safety testing. 
The finished product specifications are considered adequate and in accordance with ICH Q6B. Upon request by 
the CHMP, the applicant aligned the shelf life specification limits for purity by SEC-HPLC and Biological activity by 
inhibition of SK-BR-3 proliferation with those for release as lower requirements for shelf life are not considered 
acceptable in the absence of any trends during shelf life. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for routine testing of the finished product have been appropriately described and 
non-compendial methods have been validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1).  
Batch analysis 
The  applicant  has  provided  batch  data  for  finished  product  lots  manufactured  using  active  substance  from 
different processes. The results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Please refer to the active substance section. The reference standards for finished product are the same as those 
used for the active substance. 
Stability of the product 
Real  time  (5˚C  ±  3°C),  accelerated  (25°C±  2°C)  and  stressed  (40°C±  2°C)  stability  studies  have  been 
performed according to ICH Q5C. No decrease or trends were observed for potency or purity at 2-8°C or 25°C± 
3°C.  
An  in-use  stability  study  was  performed  and  supports  the  stability  of  the  reconstituted  finished  product  as 
indicated in the SmPC. An infusion study showed compatibility with infusion bags/systems of polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) materials at 30°C for a period of 24 hours. 
A  temperature  excursion  study  showed  that  the  product  was  stable  after  being  exposed  to  a  temperature 
excursion (25°C) of 48 hours.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life of 48 months for the finished product when stored at 
5˚C ± 3°C, as stated in the SmPC, is acceptable. 
Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) 
In preparation for Brexit, the applicant included a PACMP covering the addition of test sites for finished product 
release to ensure uninterrupted EU importation testing. The data from the analytical method transfer will be 
submitted as a Type IB variation. 
The proposed PACMP is deemed acceptable. 
Biosimilarity 
The applicant has performed an extensive comparability analysis to demonstrate biosimilarity to the reference 
product Herceptin. Comprehensive analyses of the proposed biosimilar and reference medicinal product were 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 16/128 
  
  
carried  out  using  sensitive  and  orthogonal  methods.  This  included  batches  of  EU-approved  Herceptin,  US 
licensed  Herceptin  and  Ogivri  finished  product.  US-licensed  Herceptin  has  been  used  as  part  of  a  global 
development  and  was  included  as  supportive  data,  however  the  pivotal  clinical  data  was  generated  with 
EU-approved Herceptin. The number of lots chosen for the biosimilarity analysis was based on the criticality of 
attribute, availability of an orthogonal technique, assessment of analytical method variability, complexity and 
suitability of method for large number of assays and availability of material.  
Most  of  the  quality  attributes  proved  to  be  highly  similar  between  Ogivri  and  EU-approved  Herceptin. 
Nevertheless  for  some  structural  parameters,  which  might  impact  clinical  performance,  differences  were 
observed,  such  as  for  high  mannose  and  afucosylated  glycoforms,  sialic  acid  content  and  non-glycosylated 
species. These are further discussed below. 
The  overall  level  of  non-glycosylated  species  is  very  low  and  the  small  difference  observed  is  therefore  not 
expected to have any meaningful impact. 
The total high mannose content is higher for Ogivri as compared to EU-approved Herceptin. The applicant has 
however provided in vitro bioactivity assay data dependent on Fc function (ADCC, FcγRIIIa, C1q and other Fc 
binding assays) for Ogivri which indicate a high similarity with EU-approved Herceptin lots. In addition, data 
were provided to show that the higher mannose content most probably has no impact on PK. 
As  the  overall  content  of  total  non-glycosylated  heavy  chain  (NgHC)  and  sialic  acid  is  very  low,  the  slight 
differences are not considered to have an impact on PK and biological activity.  
Afucosylated content for Ogivri is somewhat higher as compared to EU-approved Herceptin. However, the in 
vitro  bioactivity  assay  data  of  Ogivri  dependent  on  Fc  function  (ADCC,  FcγRIIIa,  C1q  and  other  Fc  binding 
assays) indicate similarity with EU-approved Herceptin lots.  
Ogivri lots showed slightly higher main peak content and slightly lower acidic peak content estimated by ion 
exchange HPLC as compared to EU-approved Herceptin. Similar results were observed with cIEF. This has been 
justified. It is acknowledged that C-terminal lysine is not expected to have an impact on biological activity. 
Taken together, the data provided indicate that Ogivri can be considered as biosimilar to EU-approved Herceptin 
at quality level and the small differences observed have been appropriately justified. A tabular summary of the 
analytical similarity assessment is provided below.

Afucosylated content for MYL-1401O is marginally 
higher as compared to EU-approved Herceptin. All the 
in vitro bioactivity assay data of MYL-1401O dependent 
on Fc function (ADCC, FcγRIIIa, C1q and other Fc 
binding assays) indicate a high similarity with 
EU-approved Herceptin lots. Furthermore, 
afucosylated content in US-licensed Herceptin when 
tested in-vitro has shown to have no measurable 
impact on ADCC activity or binding to FcγRIIIa. 
Additionally, clinical studies with these levels of 
afucosylated species have not shown any impact on 
pharmacokinetics and demonstrated bioequivalence 
within a very narrow confidence

The level of total sialic acid content was observed to be 
marginally higher for most of MYL-1401O lots 
compared to EU-approved Herceptin. Literature data 
report that high levels of sialylated forms can 
potentially impact ADCC and PK. The narrow range of 
sialyation of MYL-1401O lots when tested in vitro has 
shown to have no detectable impact on ADCC activity 
or binding to FcγRIIIa and thus there is a low risk that 
this minimal difference in sialic acid content will have 
an impact. Additionally, clinical studies with these 
levels of sialic acid content have not shown any impact 
on pharmacokinetics and demonstrated 
bioequivalence within a very narrow confidence. 
The total NgHC content of MYL-1401O lots is 
marginally lower as compared to EU-approved 
Herceptin. Although the Ng-HC content of MYL-1401O 
is observed to be marginally lower this minor 
difference is not expected to have a meaningful impact 
as the overall level of impurity is very low (<1.0%). 
This is substantiated by the ADCC and FcγRIIIa binding 
data of MYL-1401O vs EU-approved Herceptin, which 
are highly similar. Additionally, clinical studies with 
these levels of Ng-HC content have not shown any 
impact on pharmacokinetics and demonstrated 
bioequivalence within a very narrow confidence

MYL-1401O lots showed a marginally higher main peak 
content and slightly lower acidic peak content 
estimated by ion exchange HPLC  as compared to 
EU-approved Herceptin. Similar results were observed 
in cIEF as well. This could be attributed to the 
carboxypeptidase treatment included in the 
manufacturing process of MYL-1401O which removes 
the C-terminal lysine residues and changes the 
distribution of the charge variants potentially leading 
to increase in main peak content. C-terminal lysine 
variants have been reported to have no impact on 
biological activity. Additionally, the charge variants 
from MYL-1401O as well as EU-approved Herceptin 
have been extensively characterized and found to be 
comparable.

Raw materials are sufficiently controlled for possible contaminating viruses. In-process testing is performed on 
the active substance harvest to screen for possible virus, retrovirus, mycoplasma or microbial contamination. 
The MCB and sMCB were adequately qualified and tested for possible viral contamination. The active substance 
manufacturing process contains validated virus removal/inactivation steps. 
Compliance  with  the  “Note  for  guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal  spongiform 
encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products” (EMA/410/01 rev.3) has been sufficiently 
demonstrated. The active substance is produced in a serum-free medium and no materials of animal or human 
origin are used during manufacturing.  
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and 
Assessment report

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
A  major  objection  was  raised  during  the  procedure  relating  to  the  GMP  status  for  the  finished  product 
manufacturing  site.  Following  a  positive  outcome  of  a  re-inspection  of  the  site,  the  major  objection  was 
resolved.  
With  regard  to  the  biosimilarity  analysis,  the  applicant  has  performed  an  extensive  analytical  comparability 
assessment. The data provided indicate that Ogivri can be considered as biosimilar to EU-approved Herceptin at 
the quality level and the small differences observed have been appropriately justified.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommended some additional  points for investigation, relating to review of some specification limits once data 
from further commercial batches becomes available. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical studies submitted consist of in vitro pharmacodynamic studies, a single-dose pharmacokinetic 
(PK) study in cynomolgus monkeys, and a combined 28-day repeat-dose toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. Only the repeat-dose toxicity study with toxicokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations.  
The initial formulation was developed to have the same composition as that of intravenous Herceptin. This 
formulation was referred to as the Bmab 200-reference product formulation (Bmab 200-RPF), however, 
Macrogol 3350/PEG 3350 was then selected as an alternative cryoprotectant and D-sorbitol was selected as a 
lyoprotectant and bulking agent. The resulting formulation is referred to as “MYL-1401O” or Bmab 200-PGS 
formulation is proposed for the current Marketing Authorisation Application.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Trastuzumab binding inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its 
extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in 
vitro assays and animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, 
trastuzumab  is  a  potent  mediator  of  ADCC.  In  vitro,  trastuzumab-mediated  ADCC  has  been  shown  to 
preferentially  exert  its  effect  on  HER2  overexpressing  cancer  cells  compared  with  cancer  cells  that  do  not 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 20/128 
  
  
overexpress  HER2.  Finally,  the  presence  of trastuzumab  has  also  been  shown  to  mediate  macrophages and 
cancer cell killing through phagocytic engulfment (ADCP) (see Herceptin EPAR). 
The in vitro assays performed for the biosimilarity assessment were: target (HER2) binding assay, ADCC assay, 
Antibody  dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP),  surface  plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  kinetic  assays  on  the 
Biacore instrument platform for Fc gamma receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb), and 
C1q  binding  as  determined  by  an  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA),  FcRn  binding  by  SPR,  CDC 
assay, and MYL-1401O inhibition of proliferation (IOP) assay.  
All the studies supporting biosimilarity assessment were performed with MYL-1401O, except the initial 
complement dependent cytotoxicity assay, which was performed with the previous Bmab200 formulation. 
Additional CDC data were provided with a lot from a different process (see further below).  
A number of batches of MYL-1401O (current formulation) were compared to the reference medicinal product, 
Herceptin (European Union [EU]-approved [EU-Herceptin], and United States [US]-licensed [US-Herceptin]).  
ADCC  Assay  (Cell-Based  Assay)  (study  number(s):  BDL/TR/1168/13/003  V002,  BDL/TR/BR.14.5002/16/002 
and BDL/TR/BR.14.5002/15/006) 
Twenty-six batches of EU-Herceptin, 21 batches of US-Herceptin, and 12 batches of in-house MYL-1401O with 
concentrations from 0.0001 to 1000 ng/mL were pre-incubated with SK-BR-3 cells. Following incubation, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were added. The resulting cell death due to ADCC mediated 
cytolysis was detected by measuring protease release with CytoTox Glo reagent. The relative potency compared 
to the reference standard ranged from 0.62 to 1.31, 0.64 to 1.13 and 0.80 to 1.18, respectively. 
The result distribution and the quality range limits are represented in Figure 3 below:

(KD) of MYL-1401O and Herceptin to FcγRIIIa 158V and 158 F were compared by SPR.  
Results FcγRIIIa-V158: Ten batches of EU-Herceptin, 10 US-Herceptin and 6 MYL-1401O batches were 
analyzed; the dissociation constant (KD) ranged from 85.7 to 147.7 nM, 90.3 to 150.3 nM, and 102.5 to 114.3 
nM, respectively. 
Results FcγRIIIa-F158: Five batches of EU-Herceptin, 4 US-Herceptin and 3 MYL-1401O batches were analyzed; 
the KD ranged from 76.09 to 125.12 nM, 67.48 to 144.53 nM, and 76.21 to 93.51 nM, respectively. An updated 
data set including data from 7 lots of EU-Herceptin and 5 lots of MYL-1401O was provided. The FcYRIIIa-F158 
K D values of the 5 MYL-1401O lots tested were found within the Mean ± 2SD range of the EU-Herceptin lots. 
FcRn Binding Assay (Study Number(s): BDL/TR/BR.14.5002/16/007) 
The relative binding affinity to the FcRn receptor was compared between MYL-1401O and Herceptin using SPR.  
Nine EU-Herceptin, 6 US-Herceptin and 6 in-house MYL-1401O samples were analyzed; the average relative 
binding compared to the reference standard ranged from 0.86 to 1.05, 0.83 to 1 and 0.82 to 0.94, respectively.

SPR was used to determine the binding kinetics (ka, kd and KD) of MYL-1401O and Herceptin to FcγRIIa. FcyRIIa 
receptors are subject to polymorphism: 2 forms exist for FcγRIIa: 131H and H131R depending on histidine or 
arginine at position 131. Since binding of IgG depends on the isoform of the receptor used in the assays and to 
ascertain that biosimilarity applies for polymorphic forms of FcγRIIa, comparative binding data for isoforms 
131H / H131R were provided. 
For the FcγRIIa-R131 form, 5 EU-Herceptin, 4 US-Herceptin and 5 MYL-1401O batches were analyzed; the KD 
ranged from 4.95 to 6.34 μM, 5.05 to 5.95 μM and 5.04 to 5.25 μM. For the FcγRIIa-H131 form, 5 EU-Herceptin, 
4 US-Herceptin and 3 MYL-1401O batches were analyzed; the KD ranged from 2.75 to 4.18 μM, 2.10 to 2.46 μM 
and 2.71 to 2.94 μM. An updated data set including data from 7 lots of EU-Herceptin and 5 lots of MYL-1401O 
was provided. The FcYRIIa-H131 K D values of the 5 MYL-1401O lots tested were found within the Mean ± 2SD 
range of the EU-Herceptin lots. 
Fcγ RIIb Kinetics Assay (Study Number(s): BDL/HER/SAR/16/002) 
The binding kinetics (ka and kd) and dissociation constant (KD) to FcγRIIb were compared between MYL-1401O 
and Herceptin using SPR. Five EU-Herceptin, 4 US-Herceptin and 5 MYL-1401O samples were analyzed; the KD 
ranged from 9.10 to 9.92 μM, 8.19 to 9.81 μM and 8.65 to 9.89 μM.

C1q Binding Assay (ELISA method) (Study Number(s): BDL/TR/BR.14.5002/16/005) 
This study assessed the relative binding affinity of MYL-1401O and Herceptin to C1q (complement) employing a 
sandwich ELISA relative to the reference standard (QC/Q8/LS/001/03). Five EU-Herceptin, 4 US-Herceptin and 
5 in-house MYL-1401O samples were analyzed, the relative potency compared to the reference standard ranged 
from 0.64 to 1.04, 0.76 to 0.96 and 0.93 to 1.04. 
Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity Assay (Cell-Based Assay) (Study Number(s): BRL/TR/1168/11/061) 
This assay used a fluorescence based method that detects the live (SK-BR-3) cells after CDC activity of 
trastuzumab. It is based on the reduction of an oxidized, blue, non-fluorescent Alamar Blue (resazurin), to a 
pink fluorescent dye (resorufin) in the medium by live cell activity.  
Measurements were taken as percentage CDC activity at varying concentration of MYL-1401O and Herceptin. 
The data obtained from the CDC assay for MYL-1401O and reference product was analyzed using student’s 
T-test.  
Figure 6  
(H0745). 
Percentage of CDC activity of MYL-1401O (QC/Q8/LS/001/02) and Herceptin 
Similar CDC activity was observed for the internal reference standard (QC/Q8/LS/001/02) and EU-sourced 
Herceptin (H0745B01). T-test analysis indicated no statistical difference between results for MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin at all concentrations assayed. 
This assay was initially performed using the first formulation developed (Bmab200 formulation). Following 
request, additional results were provided on one lot of MYL-14O10 produced according to the current 
commercial process (lot #BS15003580 produced in August 2015 according to the 2000 L- Process C). That lot 
was compared to 1 lot of Herceptin sourced from EU and 1 lot of Herceptin sourced from US. Three trastuzumab 
concentrations were pre-incubated with SK-BR-3 cells, i.e. 250, 500, & 1500 μg/mL. After pre-incubation, 
undiluted or 10-fold diluted human plasma was added and incubated. The resulting cell death due to CDC was 
determined by comparing the fluorescence of SK-BR-3 cells pre-incubated with trastuzumab to that of SK-BR-3 
cells incubated with plasma alone. The results showed that no CDC activity was observed at any of the three 
concentrations tested when the cells were treated with either Herceptin or MYL-1401O. 
SK-BR-3 Inhibition of Proliferation Assay (Study Number(s): DDL/TR/BR.14.5002/16/005) 
The SK-BR-3 cell proliferation is inhibited by trastuzumab. SK-BR-3 cells were incubated for 5 days with varied 
concentrations of test article in Poly-LLysine coated 96 well flat bottom plates. Fluorescence was measured after 
incubation for an additional 8 hs. Proliferation was indicated by increased fluorescence.

Ten EU-Herceptin, 10 US-Herceptin and 07 in-house MYL-1401O samples were analyzed, the relative potency 
compared to the reference standard ranged from 0.90 to 1.28, 0.899 to 1.22 and 0.965 to 1.24, respectively. 
Her 2 Target binding study (Study Number(s): DDL/TR/BR.14.5002/16/004) 
The immortalized breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 expresses HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase on its surface. 
Trastuzumab binds to this receptor, suppresses its associated signalling cascade, and thereby causes antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity, as well as inhibition of proliferation. Varying the concentrations of trastuzumab 
enables a dose dependent inhibition receptor binding of SK-BR-3 cells and is comparable to the internally 
qualified MYL-1401O reference standard. 
Trastuzumab binds to HER2 receptor in SK-BR-3 cells and the extent of this binding is measured using an 
antibody based flow cytometry method.  
Twenty two EU-Herceptin, ten US-Herceptin and seven MYL-1401O samples were analyzed; compared to the 
reference standard the relative affinity ranged from 0.84 to 1.20, 0.91-1.05 and 0.89 to 1.06, respectively. 
Antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (Study number :BDL/HER/MDR/17/002) 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) is an important mechanism of action of therapeutic 
antibodies designed to recognize and mediate the elimination of virus-infected or diseased (e.g., tumour) cells.  
Engineered effector cells that stably express the human FcγRIIa-H variant receptor, and an NFAT (nuclear factor 
of activated T-cells) response element driving expression of firefly luciferase are co-cultured with SK-BR-3 cells 
and either MYL-1401O or Herceptin. Binding of trastuzumab, which is itself bound to the SK-BR-3 cells, to the 
FcγRIIa receptor on the effector cells activates the NFAT pathway, which in turn increases expression of 
luciferase. The increase in luciferase can be quantified with luminescence readout. Five batches of EU-Herceptin, 
4 batches of US-Herceptin, and 5 batches of MYL-1401O batches were analyzed; the relative potency compared 
to the reference standard ranged from 70 to 102, 60 to 123 and 91 to 115, respectively. 
Qualification summary of in vitro assays 
The following assays were qualified: HER2 binding, inhibition of proliferation, FcRn, ADCC, and FCyRIIIa. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant did not submit secondary pharmacodynamic studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the repeat dose toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys (see toxicology section). 
To examine the relative cardiotoxic potential of MYL-1401O, the applicant submitted two comparative in vitro 
studies investigating the effect of Herceptin and MYL-1401O on human and rat cardiomyocytes. The 
mitochondrial toxicity assessment and comparison between EU Herceptin and MYL-1401O is provided in Table 6 
below.

Table 2: 
Summary of Comparative Measurements of Mitochondrial Toxicity for Herceptin and 
MYL-1401O Treated Human and Rat Cardiomyocytes 
For all studies, the positive controls used in Part A and Part B studies gave statistically significant (P<0.05) 
changes in the parameters being assessed relative to untreated controls, with the exception of ATP and ADP 
levels at the 72 h time point where differences were not statistically significant. 
In the cell viability assay, MTT was more reduced at 48 h in cells treated with Herceptin and MYL-1401O than in 
untreated cells, consistent with increased mitochondrial activity, as evidenced by increased ATP levels at this 
time-point.   
Neither test article had any measurable effect on transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) or cell viability for human (up 
to 2 mg/mL) or rat (up to 0.2 mg/mL) cardiomyocytes. Similar, statistically significant increased adenosine 
diphosphate/ adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP) ratios were observed for both products in both cell lines with 
recovery to baseline after 24 to 48 hours. Additionally, a similar statistically significant inhibition of oxygen 
consumption was observed with both test articles in both human and rat derived cardiomyocytes; with recovery 
by 48 hours. 
The results suggested that Herceptin and MYL-1401O mediated comparable and reversible levels of 
mitochondrial toxicity in cardiomyocytes. No significant differences were observed between MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not submit pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of MYL-1401O were determined in cynomolgus monkeys in a single-dose study 
(MYL-Her-PC-02) in comparison with European Union (EU) sourced Herceptin (EU-Herceptin) after a single 
30-minute intravenous (IV) administration of 25mg/kg. Test articles were administered by IV infusion over 30 
minutes. The animals were monitored for 6 weeks post-dose (3 to 4 serum half-lives). Blood samples for PK 
analysis were collected from all monkeys on the day of dose administration (Day 1), pre-dose, post infusion and 
at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 (Day 2), 48 (Day 3), 72 (Day 4), 96 (Day 5), 120 (Day 6), 144 (Day 7), 216 (Day 10), 312 (Day 
14), 504 (Day 22), 672 (Day 29), 840 (Day 36), and 1008 (Day 43) h after dosing. The study also included 
observations of skin at the injection site, clinical observations, and body weight. The plasma levels of 
trastuzumab were determined using a validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.  
The results are presented below:

ADA were evaluated in one animal (number 10, a female from group 2 administered 25 mg/kg of MYL-1401O) 
removed from the calculations following consistently low serum concentrations. No underlying disease condition 
that could explain this low drug exposure was found and no ADA were detected.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant did not submit single dose toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicology program for MYL-1401O consisted of one pivotal GLP-compliant 2-way comparative repeat-dose 
toxicity study performed in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg iv for 5 weeks.  
This study was designed to evaluate differences between MYL-1401O and EU-sourced Herceptin in terms of 
clinical signs, changes in weight, food consumption, blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG), mortality, 
changes at the injection site (local tolerance), ophthalmology, toxicokinetics (TK), clinical pathology, and 
anatomical pathology. Delayed toxicity and reversibility of toxic effects were not assessed; histological 
examination at the end of treatment was used to ascertain potential toxicity differences between the test 
articles.  
The objective of the toxicokinetic component of this study was to compare the serum concentration versus time 
profiles of MYL-1401O and Herceptin following a single IV infusion and following weekly IV infusions (days 1 and 
22). The objective was also to test the final formulation containing Macrogol 3350/PEG 3350 used as alternative 
cryoprotectant and D-sorbitol used as a lyoprotectant and bulking agent. No recovery groups were included in 
this study.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed in the single-dose PK (MYL-Her-PC-02) and repeat-dose toxicity (Myl-Her-PC-03) 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose study, erythema and desquamation were reported at the 
injection sites with similar frequency and severity for MYL-1401O and Herceptin. There was no microscopic 
examination performed. In the repeat-dose study, no signs of erythema, oedema, atonia, desquamation, or 
fissuring were evident in any animal. Histopathology was performed around the site of injection at the end of the 
study for group 1 (controls), 4 (Herceptin 50 mg/kg) and 5 (MYL-1401O 50 mg/kg). The findings are 
summarised in the table below.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted a justification for not providing an environmental risk assessment. Trastuzumab is 
already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated 
with Ogivri.  Furthermore, the "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use" (EMENCHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2*) makes specific reference for certain types of products such as 
proteins, that due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, 
considering that Ogivri is a protein and there is no expected increased environmental exposure, the absence of 
formal environmental risk assessment studies for Ogivri is considered justified. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The biological and functional similarity of MYL-1401O performed in accordance with the EMA guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issue 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) was compared with EU- and US-approved Herceptin using multiple assays to 
measure both the Fab and Fc functionality.  
Those in vitro assays were: target (HER2) binding assay, ADCC and ADCP assays, SPR kinetic assays on the 
Biacore instrument platform for Fc gamma receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb), and 
C1q binding as determined by an ELISA, FcRn binding by SPR, Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity Assay (CDC 
assay), and MYL-1401O IOP assay. Since both FcyRIIa and FcyIIIa receptors are subject to polymorphism with 
two forms described depending on histidine or arginine at position 131 (131H and H131R) and 2 forms 158V and 
158F  depending  on  valine  or  a  phenylalanine  at  amino-acid  position  158  respectively,  the  binding  of 
trastuzumab  to  each  131H  /  H131R  and  158V  /  158F  isoforms  was  also  compared  and  the  results  showed 
comparative  binding  independent  of  the  isoform  tested.  The  applicant  also  submitted  a  summary  of 
qualifications for the above tests, showing their suitability for the biosimilarity exercise.  
From the results obtained it is concluded that MYL-1401O does not differ from the reference product Herceptin.  
The applicant has not provided any in vivo PD studies, secondary pharmacodynamic studies or 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies with MYL-1401O which is deemed acceptable for a biosimilar 
product application.

EMA/810499/2018 
Page 31/128 
  
  
 
 
In line with ICH guideline S6 (R1) ‘Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals’, 
functional indices related to safety pharmacology were incorporated to toxicity studies. The applicant examined 
further the mechanism behind the relative cardiotoxic potential of MYL-1401O, in two comparative in vitro 
studies investigating the effect of Herceptin and MYL-1401O on human and rat cardiomyocytes. The results 
showed that the toxicity originated from reversible impact on inhibition of respiration complex I and II and by 
mobilization of energy over adenosine diphosphate in mitochondria. The results also showed a comparable 
effect for both MYL-1401O and Herceptin.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of MYL-1401O were determined in cynomolgus monkeys in a single-dose study 
(MYL-Her-PC-02) in comparison with European Union (EU) sourced Herceptin (EU-Herceptin) after a single 
30-minute intravenous (IV) dosing. The results showed similar t1/2 observed for MYL-1401O and Herceptin, 
while MYL-1401O had a slightly higher CL rate and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss). The relative 
bioavailability (Frel) of MYL-1401O vs. Herceptin was approximately 80%. The pharmacokinetic comparison was 
however performed on a limited number of animals therefore the applicant does not claim comparative 
pharmacokinetic between Herceptin and MYL-1401O and refers to comparative pharmacokinetic studies 
provided in human (healthy volunteers and patients). 
ADA was assessed in one animal removed from the calculations following consistently low serum concentrations. 
No underlying disease condition that could explain this low drug exposure was found. No ADA were detected. 
ADA studies were not conducted because the applicant did not observe any differences in toxicity profiles, TK, or 
injection site reactions. ADA was assessed during the clinical development programme (see clinical safety). 
Information on distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic interactions were not provided but 
those studies are not required for a biosimilar medicinal product. 
The toxicology program for MYL-1401O consisted of one pivotal GLP-compliant 2-way comparative repeat-dose 
toxicity study performed in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg iv on 5 occasions 
for 4 weeks. This species is considered suitable to assess the toxicological profile of MYL-1401O. The same 
species was used in the toxicological development programme of the reference product. This study was 
designed to evaluate differences between MYL-1401O and Herceptin in terms of clinical signs, changes in 
weight, food consumption, blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG), mortality, changes at the injection 
site (local tolerance), ophthalmology, toxicokinetics (TK), clinical pathology, and anatomical pathology. The 
claimed NOEL was 50 mg/kg. The toxicokinetic results indicated there were no notable differences in MYL-1401O 
and EU-approved Herceptin exposure or bioavailability to monkeys. However, the number of animals is limited.  
Single dose toxicity study, reproductive and developmental, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity studies were not 
performed. This is considered acceptable for an application for a biosimilar product. 
No specific local tolerance studies were conducted, but tolerance was evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity 
study. A slight trend for phlebitis/periphlebitis was noted in the high dose group administered MYL-1401O. 
However, no firm conclusion as regards this finding can be made, given the low number of animals present in 
each group. 
The excipients (D-sorbitol and Macrogol 3350/PEG 3350) in the MYL-1401O drug product are different from the 
reference product and are said to be commonly used in injectable dosage forms and to comply with applicable 
European Pharmacopoeial standards. It is acknowledged that sorbitol is contained in other intravenous 
products. Relevant information about sorbitol has been included in the product information including a warning 
for patients with the rare genetic disorder of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), in accordance with the 
guideline for excipients labelling (see discussion on clinical safety). Macrogol 3350 included in MYL-1401O was 
qualified for use at the proposed levels based on animal studies reported in the scientific literature, a 
Assessment report

repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys and previous clinical experience with MYL-1401O. Additional 
information provided by the applicant and mainly consisting of literature data (data not shown) gave some 
assurance that Macrogol is considered as safe and poses no greater risk of toxicity or immune reactions 
compared to the polysorbate 20 used in the reference product (see also clinical safety section). Macrogol 3350 
is reflected in the product information under the list of excipients. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the nonclinical data indicated that MYL-1401O has a similar activity to the reference product Herceptin 
with an acceptable safety profile. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pivotal pharmacokinetics data were available from two studies in healthy volunteers (Studies MYL-Her-1001 and 
MYL-Her-1002). A population PK analysis conducted in patients with HER-2+ MBC in the phase III study 
MYL-Her-3001 was also submitted. In addition, supportive data were provided from study BM200-CT3-001-11. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Analytical methods applied during the clinical development include: Assays for quantitative determination of 
total trastuzumab in human serum (ELISA); Assays for detection of ADA in human serum (ELISA); Quantitative 
determination of HER2/neu Oncogene in human serum; Quantitative determination of trastuzumab coating of 
infusion pouch and infusion lines. 
In Studies MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002, an ELISA using anti-idiotypic antibody was used for quantitation 
of MYL-1401O/Herceptin in human serum. The concentrations of MYL-1401O/Herceptin were determined by 
spectrophotometric measurements and were then back-calculated from their respective validation/calibration 
curves. In the phase 3 study MYL-Her-3001, the concentration of MYL-1401O/Herceptin in human serum 
samples were also determined using ELISA. 
In Study BM200-CT3-001011, a single analytical method was used for the quantitation of both Bmab-200 and 
EU-approved Herceptin in human serum. Designated samples from Study BM200-CT3-001011 were analysed 
for the detection of Bmab-200 and Herceptin in human serum using an ELISA. 
Immunogenicity was detected using an electro-chemiluminescence ligand binding assay involving biotinylated 
and s-tagged drug (MYL-1401O or Herceptin) with the MesoScale Discovery (MSD) platform. This technology 
uses acid dissociation to release any anti-drug (anti-MYL-1401O or anti- Herceptin) antibodies complexed with 
free drug. Samples were then bound to corresponding biotinylated-drug and to sulfo-tagged drug to form an 
antibody complex bridge.  
A multi-tiered sample analysis approach was used to evaluate the immunogenic potential of Ogivri in studies 
MYL1010-Her-1001, MYL1010-Her-1002 and MYL-Her-3001.  
In the study MYL-Her-3001, samples that were confirmed as ADA-positive were further analysed for Nab using 
the  validated  cell-based  assay.  For  the  first  round  of  NAb  analysis,  study  samples  were  subjected  to  the 
screening  assay  (Tier  1)  for  the  presence  of  NAb  against  MYL-1401O  and  Herceptin  using  a  statistically 
determined assay cut-point. For the second round of NAb sample analysis, study samples were subjected to 2 
additional  analytical  tiers  (no  inducer  and  confirmatory  assays).  The  no  inducer  assay  (Tier  2)  eliminated 
samples that demonstrated non-specific cell growth factors that could interfere with assay performance. The 
confirmatory assay (Tier 3) determined whether the neutralizing activity was specific to MYL-1401O/Herceptin 
or due to non-specific neutralization of cell growth. Samples were taken before administration of MYL-1401O or 
Herceptin since elevated serum levels of trastuzumab can interfere with the antibody assays.  
Immunogenicity data are presented and discussed in the section on clinical safety. 
Clinical PK Study Myl-Her 1001 
Study Myl-Her 1001 was a Phase I, single-center, single-dose, 2-period, randomized, double-blind, cross-over 
study.  
The primary objective of Study MYL-Her-1001 was to confirm bioequivalence between MYL-1401O (Ogivri) and 
Herceptin administered at a dose of 8 mg/kg, administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018

in healthy male volunteers. The secondary objective was to assess comparative systemic safety and tolerability 
including local tolerance, and to evaluate immunogenicity with anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation. 
Figure 8: MYL-Her-1001 study design 
The following PK parameters were determined for Herceptin and for MYL-1401O, using noncompartmental 
analysis. 
Table 6: PK parameters determined for Herceptin and MYL-1401O using non-compartmental analysis 
Primary PK parameters were Cmax and AUC0-∞.  
The  subjects  either  received  the  test  drug  (MYL-1401O  also  referred  as  Hercules)  or  the  reference  drug 
(Herceptin) in Period I and the alternate treatment in Period II. The study drugs (MYL-1401O and Herceptin) 
were administered under medical supervision as i.v. infusions of 8 mg/kg body weight (BW) over a 90 min period 
(total volume infused of 250 mL).  
Healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 45 years, with body weight (BW) range between 60 and 95kg, 
providing body mass index (BMI) was between 18 and 29 kg/m2 were included in the study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 36/128 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The PK population included all subjects included in the ITT Set who completed both mAb treatments (Herceptin 
and MYL-1401O) without a major protocol deviation, for which at least primary PK criteria (AUC0-∞ and Cmax) 
were available for both mAb treatments. 
In total, 22 subjects were randomized to either MYL-1401O (11 subjects) or Herceptin (11 subjects). Three of 
the 22 subjects were withdrawn from the study after receiving Herceptin in Period I: 2 due to personal reasons 
and  1  by  the  Safety  Committee  after  Period  I  as  a  precaution  due  to  raised  values  for  liver  function  tests 
(transaminases) in Period I. 
The main demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects in the ITT and PP populations are shown in the 
table below. 
Table 7: Baseline characteristics in study MYL-Her-1001 
Blood samples were collected at 0, 45 (mid infusion), and 90 minutes (just prior to the end of infusion); and at 
3, 6, 9, 24, 48, and 96 hours on Days 8, 11, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, and 99. Blood samples were analysed by ELISA.  
Serum was collected from treated subjects for ADA screening on a regular basis (0 h, 48 h, 2 weeks, and 10 
weeks after treatment) and assayed with the corresponding validated assay. The 48 h samples were collected as 
reserves only, to be assayed only in case of a severe reaction during infusion or thereafter. 
Pharmacokinetics Results 
The time plot of geometric means averaged over all 19 subjects who received both formulations shows that the 
concentration/time profiles for the 2 study drugs were essentially super-imposable.

For AUC0-inf normalized or native and Cmax normalized or native, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the 
test and reference products fell within the conventional bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% 
when  comparing  Ogivri  to  the  reference  product  from  EU.  The  other  secondary  parameters  were  within  the 
acceptance range of 80-125% as well. Tmax and terminal half-life were also similar.  
Clinical PK study Myl-Her 1002 
This study was a single-centre, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm parallel-group study investigating 
the  bioequivalence  of  MYL-1401O  versus  EU-approved  Herceptin  and  US-licensed  Herceptin  as  well  as 
EU-approved Herceptin versus US-licensed Herceptin after 8 mg/kg as single dose administered as IV infusion 
over 90 minutes in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. 
The  primary  objective  of  study  Myl-Her-1002  was  to  demonstrate  pharmacokinetic  similarity  of  Ogivri 
(MYL-1401O) versus EU-approved Herceptin and US-licensed Herceptin and between EU-approved Herceptin 
and US-licensed Herceptin. The study was conducted in the US and was completed (last subject’s visit) on 27 
February 2014. 
GCP inspections were carried out by the FDA or other regulatory agencies at the clinical site where the study was 
carried out. No critical finding was found.

Figure 10: MYL-Her-1002: study design 
The primary pharmacokinetic variables for assessment of similarity were dose-normalized Cmax, AUC0-last, 
and AUC0-∞. 
The PK population included all subjects who had received treatment and for whom the PK data were considered 
to be sufficient and interpretable. Subjects who did not complete through Day 43 or who had been deemed to 
have insufficient data points for meaning analysis or who did not complete the study due to noncompliance or 
withdraw consent were excluded from PK population.  
In each study period, PK blood samples were collected just immediately prior to dose administration (0 hour) 
and at 45 and 90 minutes (just prior to end of infusion). PK blood samples were collected post-dose at 3, 6, 9, 
24 and 48 hours, relative to the start of infusion. Subjects returned to the clinical facility for the scheduled blood 
sample collections post-dose on Day 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, and 71 (over a period of 10 weeks). Blood 
samples for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and on Day 71. 
One hundred thirty-two volunteers were enrolled in the study. Eleven (11) subjects withdrew consent prior to 
the Day 43 blood draw. Therefore, one hundred twenty-one subjects completed the study. One subject was 
discontinued after study completion from the bioanalytical analysis by the pharmacokinetist because the subject 
did not receive the correct dose amount due to a dose preparation error. Therefore, one hundred twenty 
subjects are included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.

Clinical Study BM200-CT3-001-11 
This study is a supportive study. The objective was to evaluate and compare the single dose pharmacokinetic 
parameters of Bmab-200 and Herceptin in terms of AUC0-t and Cmax in patients with Her2+ metastatic breast 
cancer. 
This was a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, comparative study (BEAT MBC Study) in 
patients  with  HER2-positive  metastatic  breast  cancer  to  evaluate  the  comparative  PK,  efficacy,  safety,  and 
immunogenicity of Bmab-200 with EU-approved Herceptin. This study was conducted to meet the requirements 
for marketing authorization in the country of origin (India) and the formulation used (Bmab-200) was slightly 
different from that used in the pivotal studies. 
During this study, up to 8 cycles of Bmab-200 and Herceptin were administered over 24 weeks with 8 mg/kg as 
the loading dose and 6 mg/kg as the maintenance dose. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, Tmax, t1/2, Kel , and AUCExtrapolated (%) were calculated using 
plasma concentration vs. time profile (actual time of sample collection) data of the investigational products in 
individual subjects. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed on primary pharmacokinetic parameters i.e. 
AUC0-t and Cmax. All other PK parameters were summarized as summary statistics. 
A total of 135 patients were randomized to two arms; the Bmab-200 arm (n=67) and the Herceptin arm (n=68). 
Of these 135 patients, 134 patients were dosed and 103 patients completed all 8 cycles of the study (Bmab-200, 
n=51; Herceptin, n=52). The study included female patients who had a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of 
breast cancer and confirmed metastatic disease by biopsy or radiology.

Table 11: Bioequivalence Analysis of Bmab-200 vs. Herceptin for Single Dose PK Parameters (PK-Population), 
Study BM200-CT3-001-11 
Formal statistical analysis using ANOVA confirmed that the 90% CIs around the point estimates of the geometric 
means of the test/reference (Bmab-200/Herceptin) for the PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-t were within the 
predefined  interval  of  74%-135%,  and  also  within  the  classical  bioequivalence  interval  of  80%-125%.  The 
90%CI for Cmax was 88.74% to 107.31%; and for AUC0-t, 80.51% to 97.15%. 
Population PK 
In Study MYL-Her-3001 (see clinical efficacy section), MYL-1401O and Herceptin minimum drug concentration 
(Cmin) (pre-infusion samples) were assessed in all patients for Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. One sample at the end 
of infusion (Cmax) was collected from all patients for Cycle 1 and Cycle 6.  
The PK population included all randomly assigned patients who received at least 1 complete dose of MYL-1401O 
or Herceptin, and who provided at least 1 post-dose sample for PK analysis.  
Model development included assessment of covariate effects on the inter-individual variability in PK parameters. 
A bootstrap analysis and goodness-of-fit plots, including visual predictive checks, were presented to evaluate 
the robustness of the final model. Observed Cmin values at the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle 6 were used to assess 
the  similarity  of  MYL-1401O  versus  Herceptin  using  the  two  1-sided  t-tests  statistical  approach  for 
bioequivalence. Individual patient empiric Bayesian parameter estimates were used to estimate PK measures 
reflecting exposure to drug and were compared qualitatively between treatments. 
Treatment  was  not  a  significant  covariate  of  clearance  (p=0.176)  or  volume  of  the  central  compartment 
(p=0.567) using the likelihood ratio Chi-square test. Model-based exposure measures were similar between 
treatments. The test-to-reference mean ratios for Cycle 1 and Cycle 6 Cmin values were 103.11% and 103.88%, 
respectively,  and  their  90%  CIs  were  90.61%  to  117.33%  and  93.75%  to  115.11%,  respectively.  Thus, 
observed trough concentrations were not different between treatments at the end of the first dosing interval or 
at Cycle 6. 
It was also shown in the POP PK analysis that the model based assessment of ADA as a covariate of CL was 
inconclusive  due  to  the  low  frequency  of  ADA  development  with  each  treatment.  The  presence  of  ADA  was

modeled as a time-variant, proportional covariate of clearance. The proportionality parameter was estimated to 
reduce clearance by approximately 9% in the presence of ADA (see discussion on pharmacology).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Although currently there is no validated PD marker that is predictive of the efficacy for trastuzumab, PD was 
evaluated in Study MYL-Her-1001. This study assessed PD parameters to support the biosimilarity assessment 
of MYL-1401O and Herceptin. 
Phamacodynamics for MYL-1401O were evaluated in Study MYL-Her-1001, encompassing 22 healthy subjects of 
which 19 completed the study.  
The following PD variables were assessed in Study MYL-Her-1001: 
• 
Proliferation inhibition (antiproliferative activity) 
o  Ex vivo serum anti-proliferative activity on breast tumor cell line (BT-474) overexpressing HER2. 
•  Clinical variables 
o  Body temperature, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins. 
• 
Immunomodulation 
o  Ex vivo release of 8 cytokines in serum (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interferon-gamma). 
o  Ex vivo mononuclear cell subset modulation (frequency and activation of various populations). 
o  Ex vivo production of the same panel of 8 cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
in response to a 6-day stimulation with recall antigens and mitogen (phytohemagglutinin). 
•  Apoptosis 
o  Markers  of  apoptosis  in  PBMCs  (caspase-3,  caspase-3  activation),  DNA  fragmentation,  Akt 
phosphorylation, and HER2 labeling. 
•  Baseline in vitro stimulation 
o 
In vitro production of the same panel of 8 cytokines (see immunomodulation) by PBMCs collected 
pre-treatment in response to a 20 h culture in presence of 4 immobilized monoclonal antibodies 
(MYL-1401O, Herceptin, Avastin, and OKT3) at 3 selected doses. 
Results showed that there were no significant differences between MYL-1401O and Herceptin for any of the PD 
parameters, although many showed marked changes over time for both groups (see table below).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant’s development program to demonstrate the similarity between Ogivri (MYL-1401O) and Herceptin 
with respect to the pharmacokinetic (PK) is considered adequate and was performed according to the guidance 
on similar biological products and the recommendations given in the national and CHMP Scientific Advice. The 
comparability  exercise  was  performed  between  EU  sourced  reference  product  and  the  Ogivri  formulation 
intended to be marketed in the European Union (EU). In addition, comparability with US licensed and Indian 
Herceptin formulations were used as supportive data. 
The Ogivri (MYL-1401O) PK program consisted of two pivotal studies carried out in healthy subjects (Clinical 
Study Reports MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002) and one supportive study in combination with docetaxel in 
patients with Her2+ metastatic breast cancer (Clinical Study Report BM200-CT3-001-11). 
Several ELISA analytical methods to quantify the concentration of MYL-1401O and Herceptin in human plasma 
in  volunteers  and  in  patients  with  Her2+  Metastatic  Breast  Cancer  were  submitted.  In  general,  the  ELISA 
methods used in Study MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002 have been adequately validated before study sample 
analysis and during all accepted runs for MYL-1401O and Herceptin. The analyses were substantially carried in 
accordance with the current Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 
1 Corr. 2**). The validation of the method included assessment of precision and accuracy of the standard curve, 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 46/128 
  
  
 
the assay range (defined by the LLOQ and ULOQ), intra-assay precision and accuracy, inter-assay precision and 
accuracy, selectivity, dilutional linearity, minimum required dilution, pro-zone effect, and short-term, long-term 
and freeze/thaw stability.  
With  regards  to  study  MYL-Her-1001,  the  cross-over  design  is  acceptable  because  it  allows  reducing  the 
variability and a higher sensitivity to detect differences between both products. The selected dose (8 mg/kg 
body weight) corresponds to a frequently applied regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer, although 
the use of a lower dose (6 mg/Kg) would equally allow establishing biosimilarity and would have been preferable 
from the safety point of view. In addition, given that the clearance is independent of dose in the therapeutic 
range, any dose in this range is suitable for this study. Based on the half-life value of trastuzumab in healthy 
subjects (approx. 22 days) the length of each  study  period  of 14  weeks  (corresponding to 4.5  half-lives)  is 
adequate to full characterisation on the elimination phase and allow covering at least 80% of the AUC. This 
proposal was endorsed in the CHMP Scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/153458/2012). 
In the context of a cross-over design, based on a terminal T1/2 to be around 22 days in healthy male subjects on 
the  basis  of  known  half-life  for  endogenous  IgG1,  a  carry-over  effect  could  have  been  observed  in  several 
subjects  at  baseline  of  period  II  for  serum  concentrations  despite  the  long  interim  period  and  the  14  week 
follow-up. Therefore, the applicant proposed a sensitivity analysis to correct measured concentrations during 
period II if needed. Finally, two samples at baseline of Period II were slightly above the LOQ (75 ng/mL): before 
Herceptin  (114.2  ng/mL  for  one  subject)  and  before  MYL-1401O  (99.4  ng/mL  for  another  subject) 
administration. These concentrations were <0.1% of Cmax and no further analysis was judged needed. 
Duration of wash-out period was extended from 0-4 weeks in original protocol to 0-8 weeks to accommodate a 
few subjects for whom the 4 week interim period may not be achievable for personal or for professional reasons. 
This change was based on the need for flexibility and not on pharmacokinetics (PK) considerations, and this 
extension has no impact on study quality. This is considered acceptable. 
The study was conducted in healthy Caucasian males with a very small group of subjects with other ethnicity. 
This  difference  between  ethnic  groups  would  not  be  expected  to  cause  systemic  bias  in  the  biosimilar 
comparison  exercise.  In  addition,  healthy  subjects  represent  a  homogeneous  population  and  reduce  the 
inherent  variability.  Proposed  PK  and  statistical  methods  are  the  standard  methods  recommended  in  the 
guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence. 
The design of the second PK study MYL-Her-1002 is also considered acceptable. In the case of a monoclonal 
antibody with per definition a long half-life and a potential of immunogenicity, a parallel design is accepted. 
Volunteers are the most sensitive population for initial investigation of PK with the aim of minimizing variability 
and permitting detection of differences between pharmaceutical products. This proposal was endorsed in the 
CHMP Scientific Advice. A single dose is sufficient to detect any difference in clearance. The single dose of 
8mg/kg in intravenous infusion (over 90 minutes) is considered adequate as discussed further above. A 
sufficient number of samples to adequately characterise the whole profile were collected, with sufficient 
sampling around predicted Tmax to provide reliable estimate of peak exposure. Based on the half-life values of 
trastuzumab in healthy subjects, the length of each study period is adequate for characterisation of the 
elimination phase.  
The submitted primary PK analysis showed PK comparability of the test and reference products at the dose of 
8 mg/kg body weight given that the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (Cmax 
and AUC0-t/AUC0-∞) were well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.80–1.25 in study 
Myl-Her-1001 and in study Myl-Her-1002. In addition, the terminal half-life, Vz and CL parameters were also 
similar across the groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 47/128 
  
  
Likewise,  the  study  performed  in  patients  (BM200-CT3-001-11)  with  the  other  formulation  supports  the 
conclusion of similarity given that the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (Cmax 
and AUC0-t) were well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.80–1.25. 
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis was carried out for protocol MYL-HER 3001. Data supporting the 
appropriateness of using a linear PK model was provided. At clinical doses, trastuzumab was shown to follow 
linear  pharmacokinetics,  with  nonlinear  behaviour  being  more  substantial  at  low  concentrations  and  at  Km 
values  well  below  the  trough  concentrations  observed  at  clinical  doses.  The  use  of  a  linear  PK  model  was 
considered justified.  
The inclusion of healthy data would have been informative to unravel target-mediated effects. However, as the 
primary  aim  of  the  PopPK  exercise  was  to  show  similarity  in  (patient)  pharmacokinetics  of  Ogivri  and  the 
reference product Herceptin, thus the model can be considered fit for purpose. The model showed that observed 
trough concentrations were not different between treatments at the end of the first dosing interval or at Cycle 
6.It was also shown in the POP PK analysis that the model based assessment of ADA as a covariate of CL was 
inconclusive  due  to  the  low  frequency  of  ADA  development  with  each  treatment.  The  presence  of  ADA  was 
modeled as a time-variant, proportional covariate of clearance. The proportionality parameter was estimated to 
reduce clearance by approximately 9% in the presence of ADA, but the parameter was poorly estimated. 
Analyses in the special populations were not submitted but are not relevant in the Ogivri MAA as the biosimilar 
relies on the information already known of the reference product. No formal drug-drug interaction studies are 
needed.  
In conclusion, pharmacokinetic data provided support the biosimilarity of Ogivri (MYL-1401O) and Herceptin. 
Regarding pharmacodynamics, a wide range of exploratory PD markers were analysed in study MYL-Her-1001.  
PD investigation was done ex vivo as there are no quantifiable PD endpoints that can be investigated in healthy 
subjects. Therefore ex vivo serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from treated 
healthy subjects and used for exploratory investigation. All ex vivo and in vitro exploratory PD variables showed 
similar  responses  to  MYL-1401O  and  Herceptin.  Findings  in  this  large  PD  panel  support  the  assessment  of 
MYL-1401O as being highly similar to Herceptin. 
There were no significant differences between MYL-1401O and Herceptin for any of the PD parameters, though 
some of the individual tests making up the broader parameters did deviate between both products (CD8+ T-cell 
counts, IgG expression and cleaved caspase-3). However, given the low number of individuals, and given that 
none of the other parameter markers went out of bound it is not possible to ascribe any relevant meaning to 
these limited differences. 
Findings  in  this  large  PD  panel,  consisting  of  72  variables,  constitute  supportive  results  for  the  assessment 
MYL-1401O similarity to Herceptin. Studies on the mechanism of action were not provided which is acceptable 
for a biosimilar.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a pharmacokinetic perspective, the data provided support demonstration of biosimilarity of MYL-1401O 
and Herceptin. The pharmacodynamics investigation results also support biosimilarity.

Study MYL-Her-3001 
Methods 
The  pivotal  confirmatory  efficacy  and  safety  study  MYL-Her-3001  aimed  to  evaluate  biosimilarity  between 
MYL-1401O and EU-approved Herceptin.  
There  were  two  parts  to  the  study,  with  Part  1  being  the  main  comparative  part  and  Part  2  evaluating  the 
continued safety and immunogenicity of MYL-1401O with Herceptin administered as a single agent. A schematic 
of the study design is provided in Figure 14. Note that in contrast to the implied regimens on the figure, patients 
were  allowed  to  continue concomitant  Taxane  treatment  if  it  was  the  investigator’s  opinion  that  they  would 
benefit from this.

400 mg/m2 or epirubicin of > 800 mg/m2. 
3.  Participation in the active treatment part of an investigational drug study ≤ 28 days before 
randomization. Patients with bone or skin as the only site of disease. Patients with skin lesions 
measurable by CT scans or MRI scan as only site of measurable disease were allowed. 
4.  Surgery or radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks preceding Day 1. Target lesions had to be outside the irradiated 
fields and the patient had to have fully recovered from surgery or radiotherapy. 
5.  Presence of unstable angina or a history of CHF according to the New York Heart Association criteria, 
history of myocardial infarction < 1 year from randomization, clinically significant valvular disease, 
serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, uncontrolled hypertension, or known pulmonary 
hypertension.

(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. 
7.  Any other cancer, including contralateral breast cancer, within 5 years before screening with the 
exception of adequately treated ductal carcinoma in situ, adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, 
or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
8.  Immunocompromised patients, including known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, or 
current or chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection (as detected by positive testing for hepatitis B 
surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis C virus with confirmatory testing). 
9.  Patients with documented severe hypersensitivity reaction to trastuzumab, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or 
excipients used in their formulations, including murine protein remnants and patients with heredity 
fructose intolerance. 
10. Evidence of significant medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding (including dyspnea at rest or 
serious pulmonary illness) that, in the Investigator’s judgment, substantially increased the risk 
associated with the patient’s participation in, and completion of, the study, or could preclude the 
evaluation of the patient’s response. 
Treatments 
Both MYL-1401O and Herceptin were administered by continuous IV infusion over 90 min (±10 min) for the 
Cycle 1, Day 1 loading dose and then by continuous IV infusion over 30 min (±10 min) as the corresponding 
maintenance doses on subsequent cycles. 
In combination with the above the patients also received taxane-treatment, with the choice of taxane to be 
made by the Investigator at each study site prior to the start of screening. Said choice was then to be applied to 
all patients enrolled by that particular site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 51/128 
  
  
Since  MYL-1401O  was  developed  with  biosimilar  intent  compared  to  Herceptin,  treatments  were  dosed 
according  to  the  latter’s  SmPC,  with  a  starting  dose  of  8  mg/kg  trastuzumab  over  90  min  by  continuous  iv 
infusion followed by 6 mg/kg trastuzumab over 30 min continuous iv infusion every 3 weeks. 
For docetaxel, a dose of 75 mg/m2 of BSA administered iv over 1 hour (±10 min) every 3 weeks throughout the 
study was selected based on docetaxel being used in previous different clinical trials as well as in clinical practice 
in  a  dose  range  of  30  to  100  mg/m².  Furthermore,  published  literature  suggests  that  a  large  proportion  of 
studies and Investigators favour dosing patients with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2. 
For  paclitaxel,  a  weekly  schedule  of  80  mg/m2  was  selected  based  on  a  phase  3  study  comparing  weekly 
paclitaxel  to  every-3-week  paclitaxel  which  showed  an  improvement  in  response  rate  and  TTP  of  weekly 
administration over of the standard paclitaxel schedule. 
Dose modification of all the above was possible for selected reasons. 
After the first part of the study (eight cycles) those with CR and PR proceeded to Part 2 of the study, wherein 
single-agent  MYL-1401O  or  Herceptin  was  administered.  Those  with  SD  continued  with  a  combination  of 
MYL-1401O or Herceptin and the taxane therapy beyond 24 weeks at the investigator’s discretion in Part 1 or 
stopped the taxane therapy and continued in Part 2 with monotherapy (after a minimum of 8 completed taxane 
cycles), though exceptionally taxane combination treatment could be temporarily continued if the investigator 
deemed this necessary for the patient’s benefit.  
Those  who  were  intolerant  to  the  combination  therapy  during  Part  1  or  who  had  responded  to  therapy  and 
declined participation in Part 2 were discontinued from the study, treated at the investigator’s discretion, and 
followed  for  long-term  survival.  In  Part  2  of  the  study,  all  patients  with  at  least  SD  continued  with  the 
trastuzumab  product  that  they  were  originally  allocated  to  as  a  single  agent  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable  toxicity,  or  death,  whichever  occurred  first.  Dosing  was  done  according  to  the  EU  SmPC  of 
Herceptin. 
Concomitant drugs or treatments that were forbidden included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer 
Any tumour-directed therapy from study screening until the completion of study treatment. 
IMP or experimental procedure 
Non-study drug therapy for MBC, with the exception of hormonal therapy (permitted in Part 2 of the study 
for ER/PgR-positive patients). 
Objectives 
The primary objectives for part 1 and 2 were respectively comparison of the independently assessed best ORR 
at Week 24 and the descriptive comparison of the safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability profile of single-agent 
MYL-1401O and Herceptin. 
Secondary objectives encompassed comparison of independently assessed clinical activity at Week 24 between 
treatment  arms  by  measuring  TTP,  PFS,  OS  and  DR,  as  well  as  a  descriptive  comparison  of  the  safety, 
immunogenicity, and tolerability profiles and a PopPK comparison. In part 2 the secondary objective was to 
compare the clinical activity at Week 48 between treatment arms by measuring PFS, OS and DR, and OS at 36 
months or after 240 deaths. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 52/128 
  
  
Finally, exploratory objectives were the assessment of the impact of shed ECD fragments of the HER2 receptor 
(HER2/ECD) in serum on PK and efficacy parameters. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  best  ORR  where  objective  response  was  defined  as  a  CR  or  PR  according  to 
RECIST 1.1 criteria based on central tumour evaluation (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started) achieved at 24 weeks after start of treatment. Objective response was 
based on the best overall response recorded from the start of treatment (Day 1) until centrally assessed PD, 
death, or first administration of anti-tumour treatment (other than study drug), whichever occurred first. 
Secondary endpoints were: Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to date of first 
documentation of objective progression; Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization 
to first documentation of objective progression or to death due to any cause; Overall survival (OS) defined as 
the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause; Duration of response (DR) defined as the 
time from the first documentation of objective tumour response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of 
objective tumour progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Exploratory endpoints were: Disease control rates (sum of CR, PR, and SD) at Week 24; Baseline HER2/ECD 
evaluated as a predictor for the efficacy endpoints of ORR, OS, and TTP at Week 24 and Week 48; General 
Descriptive Summaries of HER2/ECD (elevated HER2/ECD defined as a HER2/ECD value of 15 ng/mL or greater; 
significant Percent Change From Baseline in HER2/ECD defined as a decrease of 55% or more). 
In Part 1 of the study, tumour assessments were conducted every 6 weeks (±3 days) independent of delays in 
taxane administration. In Part 2 of the study (for patients with at least documented SD, based upon local 
radiographic tumour assessments and clinical evaluation as per RECIST 1.1 criteria), tumour assessments were 
conducted every 12 weeks (±3 days) independent of delays in MYL-1401O or Herceptin administration. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 410 patients (205 per treatment group) was required to provide at least 80% power to declare 
MYL-1401O equivalent to Herceptin in the analysis of ORR at Week 24 within the respective primary endpoint 
analyses. Given an estimated 10% attrition rate the required sample size of 410 was then adjusted to the final 
needed number of 456 persons. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was done in a 1:1 proportion to MYL-1401O (also referred as Hercules) plus taxane (docetaxel or 
paclitaxel) or Herceptin plus taxane within 3 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Patients were stratified based on the following baseline covariates: 
• 
• 
• 
Tumour progression into metastatic part ≥ 2 years OR < 2 years after primary diagnosis (calculated as 
time from primary tumour surgery until randomization). Patients diagnosed with primary metastatic 
disease were classified together with the patients who progressed < 2 years, regardless of the date of 
tumour surgery. 
ER/PgR status (ER- and/or PgR-positive/ER- and PgR-negative). 
Type of taxane received (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel).

Blinding (masking) 
Treatment assignment was not disclosed to the Investigator, site or study personnel, or any Sponsor 
Representative, except for the designated site monitor responsible for unblinded monitoring. An unblinded 
pharmacist was identified at each centre, but this person’s role was limited to handling the study drug, which 
was provided them to the Investigator in a blinded manner. 
Study unblinding was performed at the end of Part 1 when the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
occurred. Only individuals fulfilling select roles at the sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO) 
were unblinded. For both parties, blinded and unblinded teams were established prior to the completion of study 
Part 1. Blinded teams at the sponsor and the CRO remained blinded for the duration of the study. 
For Parts 1, 2 and the period of time until the final OS analysis, investigators and patients remained blinded to 
the treatment that the patient received. The Coordinating Investigator remained blinded throughout the study.  
Independent oversight of this study was provided by a DSMB who reviewed partially unblinded interim and 
cumulative safety and blinded efficacy data, on a quarterly basis and reviewed partially unblinded efficacy data 
at the a priori declared interim analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical analysis sets 
ITT1 population was the one on which both primary endpoint analysis were conducted. It consisted of all 
patients who were randomized into the study under Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0; 11 Oct 2013) and 
beyond. ITT2 population set consisted of all randomized patients (i.e., included patients enrolled under Protocol 
Amendment 1 [version 2.0; 02 Jul 2012]). This early protocol version allowed randomization of patients who 
would receive second-line treatment for MBC. In total 42 patients were randomized under Protocol Amendment 
1, and these are not part of the ITT1 population. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population was defined at the end of Part 1 and was a subset of ITT1 and included patients 
who  met  the  following  additional  criteria:  (1)  received  the  treatment  to  which  they  were  randomized;  (2) 
absence of any major protocol deviations in Part 1 which precluded the evaluation of the patient including, for 
example, the lack of measurability of the lesions; the absence of violation of entry criteria which completely 
precluded  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  safety;  (3)  had  at  least  1  post-baseline  tumour  assessment  if  a 
progression disease; and at least 2 if CR, PR, or SD; (4) had received at least 2 complete cycles of treatment; 
however, if a progression, death, or discontinuation occurred before the end of the first 2 cycles, the patient was 
retained in the PP population. 
The safety population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug MYL-1401O or Herceptin, 
in any amount, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study drug received were included in 
the safety population. 
The PK population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 complete dose of MYL-1401O or 
Herceptin, and had at least 1 post-dose sample for PK analysis. 
Primary analysis 
Equivalence of MYL-1401O and Herceptin was analysed using pre-specified equivalence intervals, based on the 
ratio of ORRs. A 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the best ORRs at Week 24 was calculated 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 54/128 
  
  
based on the method of logarithmic transformation. Equivalence was declared if the 90%-CI was within the 
equivalence range of (0.81, 1.24). 
Based on scientific advice from the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/153458/2012), an additional equivalence analysis 
was conducted using the difference in best ORRs (sensitivity analysis). A 2-sided 95% CI for the difference of the 
best ORRs at Week 24 was calculated. Equivalence was declared if the CI was within the equivalence range of 
(-15%, 15%), the details of which were discussed and amended following the EMA Scientific Advice received 
March 15, 2012 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/153458/2012). This equivalence margin was based on review of literature 
and study reports, and by linking the ORR with PFS/TTP.  
The outcome of said linking found that for a TTP of 12 months the model predicts an ORR of 65.3%. The value 
(65.3% - 15%) is 50.3% and the value (65.3% + 15%) is 80.3%. These values equate to 10.10 and 13.52 
months, respectively, which is less than ± 1.90 months from the median TTP of 12 months. This deviation of 1.9 
months is not considered a clinically meaningful difference. 
Secondary analysis 
For  TTP,  PFS,  OS,  and  DR,  Kaplan-Meier  plots  by  treatment  were  presented  and  the  log-rank  test  of  the  2 
treatment groups unadjusted for any covariates was performed. For TTP, PFS, OS, and DR, Cox’s proportional 
hazards  model  was  used  to  analyse  for  treatment  effects,  adjusting  for  subgroup.  Univariate  analysis  and 
multivariate analysis with forward selection were performed. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were presented. Forest 
plots were produced for subgroups (stratification factor).  
Sensitivity analysis 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint, ORR: 
•  Subgroup  analyses  for  ORR  ratio  by  stratification  factor,  age,  race,  previous  adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or HER2-targeted treatment, visceral metastases, number of metastatic sites, CNS as first site of 
metastasis, and geographic region. 
Forest plots were produced for subgroups. 
• Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis with forward selection were performed based 
on the factors and covariates indicated above. 
•  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  analysis  for  ORR  ratio  stratified  by  the  stratification  factors  was  performed. 
Estimates of the relative risk and the odds ratio, and their 90% and 95% CIs were presented. 
• Logistic regression analysis of the treatment odds ratio adjusted for the stratification factors were performed. 
• The primary efficacy analysis was replicated in the PP population for both ORR ratio and difference in ORR. 
• The primary efficacy analysis was replicated in the ITT2 population for both ORR ratio and difference in ORR. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  with  the  Investigator  assessments  of  disease  response  and 
progression in the ITT1, ITT2, and PP population for ORR ratio. 
• The difference in ORR (with two-sided 90% and 95% CIs) was calculated with no covariate adjustment in the 
ITT1, ITT2, and PP population. Equivalence was evaluated within the equivalence region of ±15%. 
Sensitivity  Analyses  for  TTP,  PFS  and  OS  were  also  performed  by  the  applicant  in  addition  to  exploratory 
analyses.

a Number calculated by author. 
b All 32 patients continuing taxane in Part 2 switched to receiving trastuzumab monotherapy during Part 2 as per the protocol. 
The  study  protocol  initially  allowed  the  recruitment  of  patients  receiving  trastuzumab  as  both  first-  and 
second-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Forty-two patients were randomized under these 
conditions  (henceforth  referenced  to  as  Protocol  Amendment  1).  Later  recruitment  was  limited  to  patients 
receiving trastuzumab as  first-line treatment, with the objective of increasing the homogeneity of the study 
population  and  the  reliability  of  the  study  results,  and  to  more  closely  reflect  the  standard  of  care.  These 
patients,  randomized  under  Protocol  Amendment  2;  are  included  in  the  intent-to  treat-1  (ITT1)  population, 
which is also the efficacy analysis population.  
The ITT-2 population (ITT2) consisted of all randomized patients, including 42 patients enrolled under protocol 
Amendment 1. This population was used in sensitivity analyses to investigate the rigor of the results attained 
with the ITT1 population.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol was finalized on 07 Feb 2012 and was amended on 02 Jul 2012 (Amendment 1; version 2.0), 05 
Sep 2013 (Amendment 2; version 3.0), 26 Sep 2013 (Amendment 2; version 4.0), 11 Oct 2013 (Amendment 2; 
version 5.0). An errata (version 1.1) to Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0) was issued on 21 Nov 2013. Three 
country-specific amendments issued on (Amendment 3, version 6.0, dated 28 May 2014; Amendment 4, version 
7.0, dated 10 Jul 2014, and Amendment 5, version 8.0, dated 19 Aug 2014) were produced. A global protocol 
amendment (Amendment 6; version 9.0) was issued on 10 Apr 2015. The latest global protocol amendment 
Protocol Amendment 7 (version 10.0) was issued on 3 March 2017 to include the analysis of the ORR difference 
as a sensitivity analysis in alignment with the SAP. The protocol was primarily written for the US regulatory 
authority (US FDA) with a dual scope on the European regulatory authority (EMA)’s requirement on equivalence. 
Since EMA has requested to use the difference in best ORRs as the primary efficacy analysis, the analysis on 
difference of ORRs was carried out as a sensitivity analysis, without type I error adjustment. 
No patients were enrolled under the original protocol (07 Feb 2012). On 10 Dec 2012, the first patient was 
enrolled  into  the  study  under  Protocol  Amendment  1  (02  Jul  2012;  version  2.0).  In  total,  42  patients  were 
enrolled  under  Protocol  Amendment  1  (02  Jul  2012;  version  2.0)  with  the  last  patient  enrolled  under  this 
amendment on 28 Aug 2013. Protocol Amendment 2 (version 3.0; 05 Sep 2013) was related to a change in CRO. 
No patients were enrolled under Protocol Amendment 2 (version 3.0 [05 Sep 2013]) or Protocol Amendment 2 
(version 4.0 [26 Sep 2013]). All other patients were enrolled under Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0; 11 Oct 
2013) and beyond (n = 458). A summary of the key changes between Protocol Amendment 1 (version 2.0; 02 
Jul 2012) and Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0; 11 Oct 2013) is detailed below: 
-  Clear exclusion of patients who had received a previous chemotherapy as first-line therapy of MBC. 
- 
For the primary objective in Part 1 of the study, details of the variable assessed (best ORR), the method 
of assessment (the RECIST 1.1. criteria), and the time point (Week 24) of the assessment were added. 
-  A primary objective to “descriptively compare the safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability profile of 
single-agent MYL-1401O and Herceptin and; to compare the immunogenicity of MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin by examining clinical immunogenic response” was added for Part 2 of the study. 
-  Clarification that clinical activity (i.e., TTP [Part 1 only], PFS, OS, and DR) would be assessed as a 
secondary objective for Part 1 and Part 2 of the study was added. 
-  A descriptive comparison of the immunogenicity profile of MYL-1401O and Herceptin given in 
combination with a taxane was added to the secondary objectives for Part 1 of the study.

- 
The exploratory objective was amended to be assessed in Part 2 of the study as well as Part 1 of the 
study. It was clarified that the impact of shed ECD fragments of the HER2 receptor (HER2/ECD) in serum 
assessed the impact on PK and efficacy parameters. 
- 
The number of planned global sites was increased from approximately 150 sites to approximately 200 
sites. In addition, the number of anticipated male and female patients to be included in this study was 
increased from up to 470 patients to up to 600 patients 
- 
Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0) added paclitaxel as a possible type of taxane to be used in this 
study, and as such, details of the paclitaxel dosing schedule were added. In Protocol Amendment 1 
(version 2.0), the only taxane available for use was docetaxel 
- 
Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0) deleted the following stratification factor: “Previous 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy or HER2 targeted treatment (yes/no).” 
-  A number of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were changed between protocol amendment versions. 
This included the addition of inclusion criterion 5): “documentation of ER/PgR status (positive or 
negative) based on either a local or central laboratory report must have been available before 
randomization.” This was required as it was a stratification factor for randomization. 
The SAP (version 1.0) was finalized on 12 Dec 2013 and was amended on 23 Mar 2015 (version 2.0), which 
aligned with the Protocol Amendment 6 (version 9.0, 10 Apr 2015). A summary of the key changes between 
Protocol Amendment 2 (version 5.0; 11 Oct 2013) and Protocol Amendment 6 (version 9.0; 10 Apr 2015) is 
detailed below. 
- 
- 
The sample size was re-calculated based on a new meta-analysis and planned to randomize 456 patients 
in the study. 
The hypothesis of the primary efficacy analysis was updated to “Ho: RT/RC ≤ 0.81 or RT/RC ≥ 1.24, H1: 
0.81 RT/RC < 1.24”. Two-sided 90% CI for the ratio of the best ORRs was to be calculated instead of 
two-sided 95% CI. The equivalence range was updated to (0.81, 1.24). 
- 
Interim analysis was re-scheduled be performed when at least 30% information target was available to 
ensure that sufficient study information was obtained. 
Protocol deviations 
All patients who were randomized under Protocol Amendment 2 and beyond (230 patients in the MYL-1401O and 
228 patients in the Herceptin arm), irrespective of protocol deviations, were included in efficacy analysis of the 
ITT1 population. Pre-defined rules were applied to exclude patients from the PP population. A total of 20 patients 
were excluded from the PP population (8 patients in the MYL-1401O arm; 12 patients in the Herceptin arm, per 
BDRM minutes). The most common protocol deviation in both arms was the lack of a post-baseline tumour 
assessment (MYL-1401O 4 patients, Herceptin 8 patients). Reason for lack of post-baseline data in these 12 
patients was withdrawal of consent in 6 patients (all randomized to Herceptin), death (3 patients, all 
MYL-1401O), withdrawal per Investigator or Sponsor decision (2 patients; MYL-1401O and Herceptin), and AE 
not due to disease progression (1 patient, Herceptin).

Concomitant and prior medicine use 
Prior medicine use was comparable between both treatment arms, with the most common ones in the pooled 
subject group being analgesics (3.7% overall) and drugs for treatment of bone diseases (3.0% overall). No 
patients in either treatment group used an excluded prior medication. 
Almost  100%  of  patients  used  concomitant  medicine.  Most  commonly  used  medicines  were  part  of  pre-  or 
post-chemotherapy  treatment:  corticosteroids  for  systemic  use,  antiemetics  and  antinauseants,  drugs  for 
acid-related disorders and antihistamines for systemic use. 
In  Part  2  a  total  of  32  patients  (15  patients  in  the  MYL-1401O  arm,  17  patients  in  the  Herceptin  arm)  still 
received  taxane  when  entering  Part  2,  but  all  moved  on  to  receive  monotherapy  later  on.  Continuation  of 
combination therapy and switch to monotherapy, based on potential benefit for the patient, was at the discretion 
of the Investigator. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications in both treatment groups were similar to Part 1 and equal in 
both treatment arms: corticosteroids for systemic  use, antiemetic and antinauseants, drugs  for acid-related 
disorders and antihistamines for systemic use. Less patients on monotherapy used concomitant medications 
compare to those on combination therapy in Part 1.

Sensitivity analysis 
Table 18: Difference of Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Week 24 (ITT1 Population; Study MYL-Her-3001) 
The efficacy sensitivity analysis for difference in best ORR was replicated using the PP and ITT2 population. The 
difference between both treatment arms for the PP population was 4% with a 95% CI of (-4.59%, 12.61%). For 
the ITT2 population this difference between treatments was 4.1% with a 95% CI of (-4.17%, 12.34%). Both 
were  thus  well  within  the  pre-defined  equivalence  boundaries  of  -15%  and  15%,  supporting  the  primary 
analysis.

The primary efficacy analysis of ORR  was also conducted based on the  Investigator assessments of disease 
response and progression in the ITT1 population. The ratio between both treatment groups in this case was 1.08 
with a 90% CI of (0.968, 1.202), and thus within the pre-defined equivalence boundaries of 0.81 and 1.24. A 
similar analysis was also  performed in the PP and ITT2 populations showing ratios of 1.05, 90% CI (0.942, 
1.162) and 1.06, 90% CI (0.958, 1.183) respectively. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Time to Tumour Progression 
In the first 24 weeks there were 35 patients (15.2%) in the MYL-1401O group whom had tumour progression 
compared to  44  patients  (19.3%)  in  the  Herceptin  group.  According  to the  log-rank  test,  the  time-to-event 
curves  for  both  treatment  groups  were  not  statistically  significantly  different (p  =  0.192).  Note that  for  the 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for TTP the median was not reached due to the relatively small number of patients with 
tumour progression.  
The  average  hazard  ratio  remained  slightly  lower  with  a  longer  TTP  in  benefit  of  MYL-1401O,  though  the 
difference was less pronounced at week 48 than at week 24, and thus remained statistically insignificant.

Progression-Free Survival 
In the MYL-1401O arm, 189 patients (82.2%) had PFS until Week 24 compared with 180 patients (78.9%) in the 
Herceptin arm the time-to-event curves for both treatment groups were not statistically significantly different. 
The average hazard rate for progression or death was slightly lower and PFS was slightly longer for MYL-1401O 
compared with Herceptin but the difference was not statistically significant. 
Until Week 48, 55.7% of MYL-1401O and 55.3% of Herceptin subjects still did not have progression of the 
disease (see Table below). Log-rank testing showed that the time-to-event curves for both treatment groups 
were not different in a statistically significant way. 
K-M estimate of median time for PFS was 11.1 months in both treatment arms.

Overall Survival 
In the MYL-1401O arm, 223 patients (97.0%) survived until Week 24 compared to 218 patients (95.6%) in the 
Herceptin arm, and according to the log-rank test, this difference was not statistically significant.  
The  average  hazard  rate  (=  death)  from  the  Cox  proportional  hazard  model was  slightly  lower  and  OS  was 
slightly longer for MYL-1401O compared with Herceptin. The difference was however not statistically significant. 
Until Week 48 ( 
Table 26), 89.1% of MYL-1401O subjects survived compared with 85.1% in the Herceptin group. According to 
the  log-rank  test,  the  survival  curves  for  both  treatment  groups  were  not  statistically  significantly  different 
(Figure 19). 
At Week 48 the Cox-proportional hazard ratio was again in favour of MYL-1401O, with the average hazard rate 
for death being lower for MYL-1401O compared with Herceptin confirm the observation at Week 24. Likewise, 
the difference was again not statistically significant.

Duration of Response (DR) 
Of the MYL-1401O subjects 42.4% with objective response had tumour progression or died before the 48 week 
cut-off, versus 44.5% in the Herceptin group as seen in  
Table 27. Log-rank testing did not show a statistically significant difference in the time-to-event curves for both 
treatment groups (Figure 20). 
K-M estimate of median time to tumour progression or death after objective tumour response was 9.7 months

Exploratory analyses results 
Disease Control Rate 
The analysis revealed no notable differences between the arms for the proportion of patients. The ratio of 1.06 
indicated that the patients in both arms showed a similar response and the proportion of patients with disease 
control at Week 24 was comparable between the 2 treatment arms. 
HER2/Extracellular Domain 
In exploratory analyses, baseline HER2/extracellular domain (ECD) was assessed as a predictor for ORR, OS, 
and TTP. HER2/ECD expression decreased from baseline to Week 24 in both treatment arms, with no noteworthy 
difference between both arms, and remained on a similar level until Week 48. 
At  Week  24,  there  was  no  noteworthy  difference  in  ORR  between  the  subgroups  of  patients  with  baseline 
HER2/ECD values <15 ng/mL and ≥15 ng/mL (66.0% versus 67.8%). 
At Week 24 there was a consistent increase in ORR for the subgroups of patients with a significant decrease in 
HER2/ECD  expression  compared  to  patients  with  a  non-significant  decrease  in  HER2/ECD  expression.  The 
increase in ORR was higher for the subgroups of patients with a significant decrease in HER2/ECD compared to 
the patients with a non-significant decrease.

Best ORR 
Best overall response rate by subgroup is presented below. 
Figure 19: Ratio of Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Week 24 Overall and by Subgroup: ITT1 Population 
In Study MYL-Her-3001, 385 out of 458 patients (84%) received docetaxel as their taxane in combination with 
trastuzumab  (MYL-1401O  or  Herceptin).  In  these  patients,  the  difference  of  ORRs  between  the  treatment 
groups and its 95% CI were 3.3% and (-6.05%, 12.55%), respectively, which were consistent with the analysis 
results for the entire population (ORR difference of 5.5% and 95% CI of (-3.08%, 14.04%), respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018

Only 67 patients (15%) received paclitaxel as their taxane in combination with trastuzumab. In these patients, 
the difference of ORRs between the treatment groups and its 95% CI were 14.6 % and (-7.11%, 34.99%), 
respectively (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
Time to progression 
Subgroup analysis did not find any 95% CI of the TTP ratio that did not include ‘1’ and thus no relevant subgroup 
differences exist.

Note, during Part 1 of the study patients received study drug (MYL-1401O or Herceptin) plus taxane treatment and during Part 
2 patients received study drug (MYL-1401O or Herceptin) alone. 
Sensitivity analyses on TTP using the ITT2 and TP populations confirmed the above findings at week 48. 
At 24 Weeks, the final model Cox regression model showed that previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy/HER2 targeted treatment had a significant influence on TTP (hazard ratio 2.02, p = 0.003).  
At Week 48, age (p = 0.006), race (p = 0.025), previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy/HER2 targeted 
treatment (p = 0.061), and region (p = 0.045) were potential covariates to have an effect on the hazard ratio

for TTP and were included in the final Cox regression model. According to the final model at Week 48, age (≥50 
years vs. <50 years) had an influence on TTP (hazard ratio 0.69, p = 0.013). 
Progression Free survival 
Subgroup analysis did not find any 95% CI of the TTP ratio that did not include ‘1’ and thus no relevant subgroup 
differences exist.

According  to  the  Cox  regression  analysis  at  Week  24,  previous  adjuvant/neoadjuvant  chemotherapy/HER2 
targeted treatment had an effect on the hazard ratio for PFS and was included in the final model.

At Week 48, age (p = 0.004), race (p = 0.002), previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy/HER2 targeted 
treatment (p = 0.039), and region (p = 0.021) were potential covariates to have an effect on the hazard ratio 
for TTP and were included in the final model. According to said final model at Week 48, age and race had an 
influence on PFS. 
Overall Survival 
Cox regression analysis at Week 24 indicated that previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy/HER2 targeted 
treatment and race had an effect on the hazard ratio for OS and these parameters were thus included in the final 
model. 
At Week 48, tumour endocrine status and number of metastatic sites were also identified as potential covariates 
with significant impact and were thus also included in the final model. 
According to the final Week 48 model, tumour endocrine status and number of metastatic affected OS. 
In the analysis of the 95% CI of the OS ratio (Figure 24), the subgroup “tumour progression <2 years” CI at 
Week 48 did not encompass ‘1’ which indicates a relevant difference in ratio (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

MYL-1401O Plus Taxane Versus Herceptin Plus Taxane as First Line Therapy in Patients With 
HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer 
Study identifier 
MYL-Her3001 
Design 
A multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, study to compare the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  MYL-1401O  plus  docetaxel  or  paclitaxel  (i.e.,  taxane) 
versus Herceptin plus a taxane in patients with HER2+ MBC with continuation 
of  single-agent  MYL-1401O  versus  Herceptin  for  patients  who  had  at  least 
stable disease (SD) in order to evaluate continued safety and immunogenicity. 
In Part 1 of the study, MYL-1401O plus a taxane or Herceptin plus a taxane was 
administered  for  a  minimum  of  8  treatment  cycles  (1  treatment  cycle  =  3 
weeks  based  on  trastuzumab  administration),  and  the  choice  of  taxane 
(docetaxel or paclitaxel) was made by the Investigator at each study site and 
applied  to  all  patients  enrolled  by  that  site.  Tumour  assessments  were 
conducted every 6 weeks (±3 days). 
In Part 2 of the study, after completing a minimum of 8 cycles of treatment in 
Part 1 of the study, all patients with at least SD continued with the trastuzumab 
product that they were originally allocated to as a single agent until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurred first. Tumour 
assessments were conducted every 12 weeks (±3 days).  
The endpoints for the primary and secondary objectives were to be analysed at 
Week 24 in Part 1 and at Week 48 (only secondary) in Part 2. 
OS data will continue to be monitored until 240 deaths have been registered or 
until  36  month  have  passed,  whichever  comes  first.  This  data  was  not  yet 
provided and it is not clear when it can be expected in the context of the current 
assessment period.

As the primary analysis was for the FDA-approach (i.e. based on a 90%-CI), 
the overall error type I of the biosimilarity exercise in this study exceeds the 
requirements for biosimilarity as usually applied in the EU (based on a 
95%-CI). 
Sensitivity analyses were run on all efficacy endpoints by doing the same data 
analyses on the ITT2 and PP populations. At every endpoint, these outcomes 
confirmed the initial findings with ITT1.

Supportive study 
BM200-CT3-001-11 
This double blind, randomised, active control, parallel assignment part III clinical trial was a comparative study 
that aimed to investigate the PK, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Bmab-200 versus Herceptin, in HER2+ 
MBC when given in combination with docetaxel. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  PK  based  and  any  efficacy  endpoints  were  only  secondary  and 
exploratory: 
· 
· 
Comparison of the overall response rates (ORR) of Bmab-200 and Herceptin, both in combination with 
docetaxel  over  24  weeks  (up  to  8  cycles)  of  combination  chemotherapy,  based  on  RECIST  1.1  and 
imaging performed every twelve weeks. (Secondary) 
Correlation of secondary efficacy parameters with shed Her2 extracellular domain (ECD). (Exploratory) 
Study BM200-CT3-001-11 was not statistically powered to evaluate similarity in efficacy between Bmab-200 
and  the  reference  product,  and  it  did  not  have  a  provision  for  confirmation  of  response.  Furthermore,  the 
product  Bmab-200  differs  in  the  types  of  excipients  used  compared  to  MYL-1401O.  Given  all  of  the  above, 
results of this trial are considered supportive only. 
A total of 135 patients were randomized to two arms; the Bmab-200 arm (n=67) and the Herceptin arm (n=68). 
Of these 135 patients, 103 patients completed all 8 cycles of the study (Bmab-200, n=51; Herceptin, n=52). 
The  study  included  female  patients  who  had  a  confirmed  histopathological  diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  and 
confirmed metastatic disease by biopsy or radiology. 
The demographic profile was similar between both study arms and none of the patients had prior exposure to 
trastuzumab or other anti-Her2 treatments. 
The following efficacy data sets were defined: 
‒ 
Intent to Treat-Full Analysis Set (ITT-FAS) = all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by 
randomization.  One  patient  in  this  population  set  withdrew  consent  before  the  first  dosing  and  was 
excluded from the efficacy evaluations. 
‒  The  Per-Protocol  (PP)  population  =  all  patients  in  the  ITT-FAS  population  with  exclusions  based  on 
pre-specified reasons and consisted of 124 patients. 
Efficacy outcomes 
ORR 
The ORR in the ITT-FAS population was 65.15% in the Bmab-200 arm and 75.00% in the Herceptin arm, similar 
to the historical ORR i.e. between 61% and 73% with Herceptin in first-line MBC patients. The mean as well as 
median number of cycles received by the patients in the two groups was similar.

Table 25: Statistical Analysis of Overall Response Rate (ITT-FAS Population) 
Evaluation of the PP subset gave similar results. 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) 
The analysis of clinical benefit rate showed an odds ratio of 1.38 (95% CI: 0.48, 3.94), indicating that the arms 
showed a similar response. The proportion of patients with clinical benefit at week 24 (86.36% vs 89.71%) was 
comparable between the two treatment arms. 
Correlation of Response with Shed HER2 Extracellular Domain 
Of all patients who had baseline HER2 ECD data, 47 (75.8%) in Bmab-200 arm and 52 (80.0%) patients in 
Herceptin arm had baseline ECD levels of at least 15 ng/ml. Those patients with baseline shed Her2 ECD levels 
of > 15 ng/ml were considered as positive for shed Her2 ECD. Analysis indicated that neither in any of the arms 
nor in the overall cohort there was any correlation between baseline ECD level and likelihood of response to 
therapy (p=1). 
Progression Free Survival Rate 
For the ITT-FAS population, the PFS rate at 12 weeks was 84.85% in Bmab-200 arm compared to 85.29% in 
Herceptin arm, and 66.67% and 75.00% respectively at week 24. 
A  similar  trend  was  observed  in  the  PFS  rates  for  PP  population  showing  similarity  between  Bmab-200  and 
Herceptin. 
Mean Change in Target Lesions Sizes 
The mean sum of longest diameter of target lesions over the course of the trial remained similar for Bmab-200 
and Herceptin at baseline, week 12 and Week 24; and in both arms the number of target lesions declined to a 
similar extent from baseline to Week 24 (66.1% for Bmab-200 and 66.0% for Herceptin). Discussion on clinical 
efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
MYL-1401O (Ogivri) is a proposed biosimilar of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in the indications of metastatic breast 
cancer, early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. The assessment of comparability in terms of efficacy 
is based on two clinical trials: one pivotal study, MYL-HER-3001, and one supportive, study BM200-CT3-001-11. 
The Applicant claims biosimilarity only for IV administration while SC administration is not applied for.

The pivotal trial, MYL-HER-3001, was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of MYL-1401O plus docetaxel or paclitaxel (i.e., taxane) versus Herceptin plus a taxane 
in patients with HER2+ MBC with continuation of single-agent MYL-1401O versus Herceptin for patients who had 
at least stable disease (SD) in order to evaluate continued safety and immunogenicity. 
The use of trastuzumab and a taxane is reflecting the current clinical practice (in those countries where Perjeta 
is not available) for those patients with a free interval of relapse from adjuvant more than 12 months. In the first 
version of the protocol only docetaxel was allowed as taxane treatment but in subsequent protocol amendments 
study sites were given the choice whether to use docetaxel or paclitaxel. Although the inclusion of paclitaxel 
increased the background noise, it is agreed that the mixed taxane use is a more realistic representation of in 
practice treatment procedures. The type of taxane received (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel) was a stratification 
factor, along with hormonal status and tumour progression into metastatic phase ≥ 2 years OR < 2 years after 
primary diagnosis. Other stratification factors such as prior adjuvant trastuzumab would have been desirable.  
Dosing of the treatments was based on the dosing of the reference product. The chosen dose of 75 mg/m2 of 
docetaxel is in line with the current use of this taxane (higher dose of 100 mg, though authorised, are not widely 
used  due  to  the  toxicity).  Paclitaxel  was  given  as  a  Q3W  dosing  regimen  instead  of  the  standard  weekly 
administration schedule based on the results of a phase 3 study showing an improvement in response rate and 
TTP of weekly administration over of the standard paclitaxel schedule. 
Amendments  were  provided  individually  for  review.  After  review,  changes  effected  were  deemed  logical, 
especially  as  most  important  updates  were  made  following  requests  by  regulatory  bodies  to  adapt  study 
elements to be in line with more state-of-the-art knowledge. Unblinding for part 1 of the study was done on 3 
March 2016. This in essence means that the last update of the protocol was undertaken post part 1 unblinding, 
however this last update was done in order to incorporate the additional analysis requested by EMA which was 
lacking in the original protocol. There is no hint that the protocol changes were related to study data. Thus an 
impact of these changes on the confirmatory interpretation of study results is considered unlikely.   
With regards to inclusion criteria, metastatic population can be heterogeneous in terms of previous therapy and 
sites of disease. In this regard, the potential pre-treatment with trastuzumab or lapatinib in the adjuvant setting 
is reflected into the inclusion criteria, albeit they were allowed if metastatic disease was diagnosed at least 1 
year after the last dose of treatment. When the baseline characteristics of the patients finally recruited into the 
trial are observed, only 9.6% vs 7.0% had previously received trastuzumab in the biosimilar arm vs Herceptin 
group respectively. 
Proposed primary endpoint (best ORR) and timing of the efficacy analysis are acceptable for the purpose of 
comparability exercise. Best ORR was analysed by measuring if the ratio of best ORR fell within a predefined 
equivalence margin of (0.81, 1.24). The analysis on the difference of best ORR was included as a sensitivity 
analysis instead of a second primary analysis. An equivalence margin of (-15%, 15%) was chosen for this 
analysis.  
Due to the statistical testing strategy whereby the ORR ratio with the 90% CI was considered as the primary 
outcome and the ORR difference with a 95% CI as a sensitivity outcome, the overall type I error is larger than 
usually accepted in a clinical biosimilarity trial. This was considered acceptable given the results of the trial (see 
discussion under efficacy data and analysis). 
The clinical justification of the (-15%, 15%) equivalence range is based on a regression analysis linking TTP (and 
PFS) to ORR (data not shown). Based on this analysis the applicant claimed that differences in ORR within this 
interval (15%) will correspond to approximately ± 1.90 months in PFS, which is significantly lower than the 
margin of 3.5-4 months in PFS considered clinically significant. However, the applicant’s approach neglected the 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 86/128 
  
  
uncertainty inherent to the regression analysis. To address this point, the applicant provided an analysis using 
95% confidence bands for the weighted least-squares (WLS) linear regression with time to progression (TTP) as 
the dependent variable and ln(ORR) as the independent variable (data not shown). This analysis showed that 
even at the extremes of the 95% CI bands the increase in calculated PFS is around 2.5 months, which is less 
than what is normally considered clinically meaningful and thus supports the notion that the original equivalence 
range is sensitive enough to discern equivalence. The Applicant also recalculated the linear regression model 
using the results of the study itself as an extra variable, and results were still within the previously established 
ranges. Furthermore, stratification of patients in responders and non-responders showed that the PFS of the 
former were very much identical over the 48 weeks course of the trail (data not shown).  
The validation of use of ORR for margin calculation was done using literature data that was a mix of PFS and TTP 
weighted  outcomes.  The  interchangeability  of  PFS  and  TTP  and  its  impact  in  the  metastatic  setting  was 
discussed and it was considered that, in this particular exercise, the mixing of PFS/TTP endpoints will not likely 
have influenced the robustness of the validation. 
Taken together, the chosen equivalence margin was considered acceptable. 
Secondary endpoints were TTP, PFS, OS and in Part 2 additionally DR. These secondary endpoints are 
considered acceptable.  
The supportive study, BM200-CT3-001-11, was a double blind, randomised, active control, parallel assignment, 
comparative phase III clinical trial focused on PK comparison, and was conducted in 23 centres in India. This 
study was not statistically powered to evaluate similarity in efficacy between Bmab-200 and the reference 
product, and it did not have a provision for confirmation of response.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  participant  flow  did  not  reveal  important  concerns  in  both  groups  of  treatment.  Within  the  ITT1,  there 
appears to be fewer patients with disease progression (17.8% vs 24.2%) and more patients that complete the 
part  1  of  the  study  (75.2%  vs  69.7%)  in  the  biosimilar  arm  compared  to  the  reference  arm.  The  protocol 
deviations  leading  to  exclusion  from  the  PP  population  were  evenly  balanced,  with  the  highest  difference 
reported in terms of lack of post-baseline tumour assessment. However, absolute numbers were low and the 
impact on the final results expected to be minor.  
Overall, baseline characteristics and disease were generally comparable between arms. Only slight imbalances 
were observed in terms of ECOG, tumour progression into metastatic phase, presence of visceral disease and 
number of metastatic sites. Overall these slight imbalances appeared to favour to the biosimilar arm. However 
the actual weight of these cannot be determined. Additional analyses showed the difference in terms of ECOG 
and  presence  of  visceral  metastasis  was  non-significant  (data  not  shown).  The  imbalance  in  number  of 
metastatic  sites  was  considered  to  be  a  randomization  effect  and  no  impact  on  the  results  was  expected. 
Furthermore, the imbalance in tumour progression into metastatic phase was deemed small and thus was not 
considered a likely bias factor. 
From Part 1 to Part 2 the percentage of patients using concomitant medications remained constant. Note is 
taken however of the fact that medications previously considered concomitant were reassessed, as they were 
administered after disease progression, discontinuation of study drug, or as second-line treatment. Therefore, 
percentages of patients using concomitant medications can be lower across the study compared with Part 1. 
The pivotal MYL-HER-3001 study met the primary endpoints, as the 95% CI for the difference in ORR at week 24 
[-3.08, 14.04]) fell within the predefined equivalence margins of (-15, 15).  
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 87/128 
  
  
Analysis  by  subgroup  stratification  factor  was  provided.  Results  generally  supported  the  ORR  ratio  and 
difference findings, though three subgroups seemed to indicate a better response with MYL-10401O (tumour 
endocrine  status  negative,  previous  adjuvant/neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  subgroup  of  patients  with  3 
metastatic  sites).  However,  given  the  very  limited  amount  of  patients  per  subgroup  no  clinical  or  statistical 
significance can be ascribed to these results. 
In the case of the analysis of the difference in ORR for the subgroup of patients that were treated with paclitaxel 
as  concomitant  taxane,  the  upper  boundary  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  ORR  rates  laid  far  outside  the 
predefined equivalence margin of [-15%,15%]. The analysis set for each treatment group was relatively small 
(35  in  the  MYL-1401O  group  and  32  in  the  Herceptin  group)  and  therefore,  the  percent  difference  between 
groups  and  margins  need  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Furthermore,  the  study  was  not  powered  for  the 
analyses based on taxane subgroup. 
Overall,  analysis  by  subgroup  stratification  factor  confirmed  the  findings,  and  sensitivity  analyses  which 
consisted of running the same batch of confirmatory analyses on the ITT2 and PP populations, found similar 
results, thus confirming the validity of the primary outcomes. 
Secondary endpoint analyses (ran on ITT1, ITT2 and PP populations for sensitivity analysis reasons) was aimed 
at TTP, PFS and OS factors. No statistical difference was observed in these endpoints between the two arms in 
the  ITT1  population.  Results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  using  the  ITT2  and  TP  populations  confirmed  these 
findings. The results were considered robust as the investigator assessments were in line with the main analysis.  
It was noted that TTP and PFS appeared to show a better result for the biosimilar, although the numbers of 
events were still too low to reach any conclusion (17% in TTP and 19% for PFS). This observation was also 
reported when looking at the main analysis in terms of ORR (69.6% in the MYL1401O vs 64% in the Herceptin 
arm) and at the upper bound of the CI for the ORR. More mature data in terms of PFS and TTP (week 48) were 
provided and supported biosimilarity as discussed further below. Lower upper CIs were also observed at week 
48 for the differences in ORR. However, the comparison of the two parts of the study is limited as only patients 
who had at least SD after the first part of the study were allowed to receive MYL-1401O in monotherapy. Some 
of the differences observed at baseline, such as number of metastatic sites, presence of visceral disease, ECOG, 
etc. could have influenced the apparent better efficacy results of MYL-1401O. 
Altogether, given the confirmed similarity of secondary endpoints in week 48, the similarity shown in terms of 
pharmacokinetics, the relatively low numbers involved and the fact that slight baseline differences may have 
disproportionately affected these relatively small subgroup analyses, the observations are not considered of 
concern. 
The overall observation of no statistical difference in secondary PFS, TTP and OS outcomes were replicated and 
confirmed through sensitivity analyses in Part 2 of the study. However, as less than 50% of patients presented 
with tumour progression or death, the values for these parameters can still be expected to change post 48 
weeks. For the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the median OS was not reached at Week 24 or at Week 48 due to the 
relatively  small  number  of  patients  in  the  ITT1  population  who  died  prior  to  those  time  points.  Thus,  K-M 
estimates  are  of  limited  value  up  until  the  Week  48  data  cut-off  point.  The  final  CSR  including  the  final  OS 
analysis of the MYL-Her-3001 study is expected to be submitted as soon as available. 
According to the final Cox regression models at week 48 some patient and disease characteristics were 
considered to have an influence on TTP, PFS and OS respectively. Due to the small sample size in these subgroup 
analyses the data should be considered of limited clinical relevance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 88/128 
  
  
In the analysis of the 95% CI of the OS ratio, the subgroup “tumour progression <2 years” CI at Week 48 did not 
encompass ‘1’ which indicated a relevant difference in ratio. Upon analysis, no particular clinical explanation 
could be found. However, given the very small number of patients in this subgroup, as well as the fact that the 
result  was  not  replicated  in  the  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  ITT2  and  PP  populations,  this  result  is  likely  an 
aberrant artefact. 
The Week 48 analysis of duration of response likewise indicated that no significant difference exists between 
MYL-1401O and Herceptin treated subjects. 
As for the exploratory endpoints, disease control was defined as the sum of ITT1 patients who had CR, PR, and 
SD according to RECIST 1.1 (based on central tumour evaluation). The analysis of disease control rate revealed 
no notable differences in disease control rates between the arms.  
HER2/ECD was assessed as a predictor for ORR, OS and TTP and expression decreased from Baseline to Week 
24 in both treatment groups with no noteworthy difference between both groups, and this trend continued in 
Part 2 of the study. 
A full analysis of immunogenicity is provided in the safety part of this report, and it was noted that both ADA and 
Nab titres were low and similar in both arms during the study. Moreover, a summary and analysis of best ORR 
at Week 48 for patients with at least 1 ADA assessment (PP population) was provided (data not shown). No 
diminution or suppression of response was observed in relation to ADA positive status. However, the result may 
not be meaningful due to the small numbers of patients. 
In the supportive study BM200-CT3-001-11, the analysis of ORR indicated that a higher number of patients 
treated  with  Herceptin  had  partial  response  compared  to  those treated  with Bmab-200,  but  this  may be  an 
artefact from the fact that the number of patients with stable disease was higher in the Bmab-200 arm than in 
the Herceptin arm.  
Comparison of the efficacy results between the MYL and BM200 studies is limited in scope due to the differences 
in the designs, the use of different formulations and the fact that efficacy was a primary endpoint in the former 
and a secondary in the latter. Based on a very high level comparison both trials are supportive of each other in 
regards to their respective efficacy findings. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Similarity in terms of ORR at week 24 has been shown with the a priori defined margin of similarity (15%). The 
results are considered robust enough as different sensitivity analyses support the main analysis, including 
comparison according to stratification factors and analyses in the ITT2 and PP groups. The results of the primary 
analysis are further supported by secondary efficacy endpoints. Overall, the clinical efficacy data support 
biosimilarity. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Main  safety  information  for  MYL-1401O  were  generated  in  the  pivotal  study  MYL-Her-3001  in  patients  with 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, provided to date for up to 48 weeks of treatment (Parts 1 & 2). This 
dataset is further supported by results from two other comparative studies, MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002, 
in healthy male volunteers. The fourth study, supportive Study BM200-CT3-001-11, was conducted in patients 
with HER2-positive MBC, but with another formulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 89/128 
  
  
Of the four studies contributing to safety data base, studies MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002 were single dose 
(8 mg/kg) PK studies. In Part 1 of Study MYL-Her-3001, patients received study drug in combination with a 
taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) for a minimum of 8 treatment cycles (1 treatment cycle=3 weeks based on 
trastuzumab administration; total of 24 weeks) starting with loading dose 8 mg/kg IV, followed by maintenance 
dose of 6 mg/kg IV, every 3 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, all patients with at least stable disease continued with 
the  trastuzumab  product  that  they  were  originally  allocated  to  as  a  single  agent  until  disease  progression, 
unacceptable  toxicity,  or  death,  whichever  occurred  first  (maintenance  dose  for  a  maximum  of  8  treatment 
cycles; total of 24 weeks). Patients in supportive Study BM200-CT3-001-11 received study drug Bmab-200 or 
EU-approved Herceptin in combination with docetaxel over 24 weeks (up to 8 cycles) according to the same 
dosing regimen as in the Study MYL-Her-3001. 
A  pooled  safety  analysis  was  not  applicable  due  to  heterogeneity  of  study  populations  (patients  or  healthy 
subjects) and different duration of treatment exposure (long-term or single-dose). 
Analyses  of  safety  included  hypersensitivity  monitoring  via  vital  sign  measurements,  electrocardiograms 
(ECGs),  physical  examination  findings,  immunogenicity  by  measuring  the  ADA  levels.  Data  also  included 
Adverse  Events  (AEs),  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs),  serious  AEs  (SAEs),  infections,  clinical  laboratory 
analyses  and  concomitant  medications.  In  addition,  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESIs),  which  are  potential  and 
identified risks of Herceptin were performed (pulmonary toxicity, cardiotoxicity, hematologic toxicity, infusion 
reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity). 
Patient exposure 
Overall,  313  patients  received  at  least  1  full  or  partial  infusion  of  MYL-1401O/Bmab-200  and  314  patients 
received Herceptin.  
In MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002, the cumulative dose of MYL-1401O is very close to the cumulative dose of 
Herceptin (Table 30). 
In MYL-Her-3001, the cumulative dose of trastuzumab in Part 1 of the study was similar in both arms, but over 
a  48  week  treatment  duration  (parts  1  &  2),  the  cumulative  dose  of  MYL-1401O  was  slightly  higher  than 
Herceptin (Table 30). Across the study through Week 48, patients in the MYL-1401O arm received a median of 
2 trastuzumab cycles more than patients in the Herceptin arm.

In  MYL-Her-3001,  at  each  cycle  (between  1  and  17  cycles),  slightly  more  patients  were  treated  in  the 
MYL-1401O arm than in the Herceptin arm. The difference is globally increasing with the number of cycles (from 
50% patients in each arm to around 53% patients in the MYL-1401O arm compared to 47% in the Herceptin 
arm).

Disposition of patients 
Study MYL-Her-3001 
A total of 500 patients with HER2-positive MBC were randomized in 1:1 ratio in MYL-1401O plus taxane arm or 
EU-approved Herceptin plus a taxane arm.  
In part 1, the safety population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and consisted of 
493 patients (247 in the MYL-1401O arm and 246 in the Herceptin arm).  
In part 2, the safety population included all patients who entered in part 2 and consisted of 342 patients (179 in 
the MYL-1401O arm and 163 in the Herceptin arm). From them, 32 patients (15 patients in MYL-1401O and 17 
in Herceptin, taxane distribution not known: docetaxel or paclitaxel) entered Part 2 and continued using taxane 
before  they  switched  to  trastuzumab  monotherapy  during  Part  2.  Continuation  of  combination  therapy  and 
switch to monotherapy, based on potential benefit for the patient, was at the discretion of the Investigator. Data

of these 32 patients are included in the ‘Part 2 monotherapy only” subset for the time the patients actually 
received monotherapy. 
As shown in Table 34, 116 (64.8%) patients completed Part 2 in MYL-1401O and 98 (60.1%) patients in the 
Herceptin  arm.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  disease  progression  (MYL-1401O  31.3% 
versus Herceptin 31.9%).

Study MYL-Her-1001 
The safety population was the same as the ITT population and consisted of 22 subjects who were randomized 
and received a single dose of MYL-1401O or Herceptin (N=22) in Period 1 and the alternative in Period 2, except 
for 3 subjects who were withdrawn (2 due to personal reason, and 1, patient 122, by the Safety Committee as 
a precaution due to elevated transaminase) before receiving MYL-1401O (N=19). 
Study MYL-Her-1002  
The safety population included all 132 subjects who received MYL-1401O, Herceptin-EU, or Herceptin-US during 
the study (44 in each arm). 
Study BM200 CT3-001-11  
The safety population included all patients randomized in 1:1 ratio who received at least 1 dose of Bmab-200 or 
Herceptin, and consisted of 134 patients. As shown in Table 35, of the 67 patients randomized to the Bmab-200

arm, 51 completed the study. In the Herceptin arm, of the 68 patients randomized, 52 completed the study. The 
major reasons for discontinuations were similar in both arms.

Adverse events 
Study MYL-Her-3001 
Overall, at 48 weeks, the safety profiles are comparable in the 2 arms, with as similar number of patients with 
at least 1 grade 3 or higher TEAE, with serious TEAE, with TEAE leading to interruption of trastuzumab or to 
discontinuation of the study (Table 36). However, in the Myl-1401O arm compared to in the Herceptin arm, 
there were slightly more TEAE (2639 and 2376 events, respectively) (but similar number of patients with TEAE: 
98% and 97.2%, respectively) (Table 36). 
Moreover, in the MYL-1401O arm compared to in the Herceptin arm, there were more treatment-related TEAE 
(356 and 273 events, respectively) and more patients with treatment-related TEAE; 103 patients (41.7%) and 
88 patients (35.8%), respectively.

The incidence of TEAEs was similar between the treatment groups. However, there were few noted differences 
(> 5%) in the incidence of TEAEs between the treatment arms, including nausea (21.1% to 15.4%), asthenia 
(23.1% to 16.7%), arthralgia (13.4% to 5.7%), and upper respiratory tract infection (7.3% to 2.0%) in the 
MYL-1401O arm and Herceptin arm respectively. In Part 2 of the study, when patients were on monotherapy, 
the incidence of these events in MYL-1401O and Herceptin arm were similar and are as follows: nausea 2.2% to 
2.5%, asthenia 2.8% to 1.8%, arthralgia 2.8% to 1.2%, upper respiratory tract infection 2.2% to 1.2%. 
In terms of causality as reported by investigator, in the MYL-1401O arm compared to in the Herceptin arm, there 
were  more  treatment-related  TEAE  (356  and  273  events,  respectively)  and  more  patients  with 
treatment-related TEAE; 103 patients (41.7%) and 88 patients (35.8%), respectively. Overall, the SOCs with 
the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were General disorders and administrative site conditions 
(12.8%);  Investigations  (8.3%);  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (7.7%);  Respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal  disorders  (6.5%);  Cardiac  disorders  (6.1%);  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (5.9%);  and 
Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (5.3%).  There  were  more  than  5%  difference  between  the 
MYL-1401O arm compared with the Herceptin arm only for treatment-related Gastrointestinal disorders which 
was higher in the MYL-1401O arm (8.9%) compared with the Herceptin arm (2.8%). For Part 2 monotherapy 
patients, the incidence of TEAEs that were considered related to the treatment by the Investigator was similar 
between the MYL-1401O arm and the Herceptin arm (28 patients; 15.6% and 25 patients; 15.3% respectively). 
In terms of severity, the majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity (Table 38). Overall, 65.7% of 
patients experienced TEAEs of Grade 3 or greater in severity, and the incidence of these events was similar 
between  treatment  groups  (Table  39).  For  Parts  1  and  2,  the  incidence  of  Grade  4  neutropenia  events was 
similar between the treatment groups: 70 patients in the MYL-1401O arm and 62 in the Herceptin arm (none in 
part 2). Most TEAEs resolved by the end of Week 48 and were considered not related to study drug (including 
Grade 4 neutropenia). Also the majority of these events occurred in Part 1 of the study and the combined Part 
1 and Part 2 results are driven by the higher number of events in Part 1 of the study.

Study MYL-Her-1001  
Slightly less AEs were reported during the study with MYL-1401O compared to Herceptin: 47 AEs in 16 subjects 
(84.2%) and 73 AEs in 21 subjects (95.5%), respectively. 
The SOCs with the most frequently reported TEAEs for MYL-1401O were nervous system disorders (47.4%) and 
infections and infestations (42.1%), and for Herceptin they was a higher incidence of infections and infestations 
(81.8%) and a similar incidence of nervous system disorders (45.5%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  AE  preferred  terms  for  MYL-1401O  were  headache  (47.4%),  followed  by 
nasopharyngitis (26.3%) and CRP increased (21.2%), while for Herceptin they were nasopharyngitis (54.5%), 
followed by headache (45.5%), rhinitis (36.4%), and CRP increased (31.8%). Most TEAEs were mild (42 for 
MYL-1401O, and 68 for Herceptin). There was only a single severe TEAE of streptococcal pharyngitis which was 
considered to be possibly related to the administration of MYL-1401O. Most of the TEAEs were considered to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 99/128 
  
  
 
at least possibly related to study drug administration (44 for MYL-1401O and 67 for Herceptin; including all of 
the most common preferred terms: headache, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, and CRP increased).  
Overall, MYL-1401O and EU approved Herceptin were well tolerated after 8 mg/kg as a single dose administered 
to healthy male volunteers as an IV infusion over 90 minutes. There were no clinically relevant differences in the 
incidence, nature, and severity of TEAEs reported. 
Study MYL-Her-1002  
Over the course of the study, the number (percentage) of patients reporting TEAEs was slightly higher in the 
MYL-1401O arm compared to the Herceptin-EU arm, which was slightly higher than the Herceptin-US arm: 31 
patients (70.5%, 91 TEAEs), 28 patients (63.6%, 80 TEAEs) and 24 (54.5%, 56 TEAEs), respectively. 
The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) following administration of MYL-1401O was headache which 
was  reported  by  12  patients/44  (27.3%),  then  back  pain  (7/44,  15.9%),  and  influenza  like  illness  (5/44, 
11.4%).  Following  administration  of  Herceptin-EU,  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  were  headache  (13/44, 
29.5%), chills (11/44, 25%) and  upper respiratory tract infection (4/44, 9.1%). Following administration of 
Herceptin-US, the most frequently reported AE were headache (10/44, 22.7%), then nausea (4/44, 9.1%) and 
dizziness (3/44, 6.8%). 
The investigator considered 54 of the 91 TEAEs to be at least possibly related to MYL-1401O, 52 of the 80 TEAEs 
at least possibly related to Herceptin-EU, and 32 of the 56 TEAEs at least possibly related to Herceptin-US. All 
TEAEs were considered resolved by the principal investigator at the end of the study. 
The TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity (no severe TEAE). 
Overall, MYL-1401O, EU-approved Herceptin, and US-licensed Herceptin were well tolerated after 8 mg/kg as 
single dose administered to healthy male volunteers as an IV infusion over 90 minutes. There were no clinically 
relevant differences in the incidence, nature, and severity of TEAEs reported from the 3 treatment groups.

In both arms, trastuzumab was only used in combination with docetaxel. The incidence of TEAEs, severe TEAE, 
treatment-related TEAEs and SAE was observed to be slightly lower in the Bmab-200 arm than in the Herceptin 
arm (Table 40). 
Table 36: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety Population; Study BM200-CT3-001-11) 
Most common treatment emergent adverse events were pyrexia and diarrhoea (incidence >10% in both arms). 
The  following  TEAEs  occurred  >5%  in  both  the  treatment  arms:  anaemia,  abdominal  pain,  constipation, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, asthenia, oedema peripheral, pain, pyrexia, hyperglycaemia, back pain, pain in extremity, 
cough, and alopecia.

In terms of severity, the majority of the TEAEs were mild or moderate. Similar numbers of patients (and % of 
patients) had Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 5 (death related) TEAE in Bmab-200 arm and the Herceptin arm (Table 
41).  However,  Grade  2  (moderate)  and  Grade  3  (severe)  TEAEs  were  less  frequent  in  Bmab-200  arm  than 
Herceptin arm. The number of Grade 4 TEAE was not provided. 
Table 37: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Severity (Study BM200- CT3-001-11) 
Overall  the  treatment  with  Bmab-200  was  well  tolerated  in  combination  with  docetaxel  and  no  new  or 
unexpected safety signals were observed. There were no relevant differences between the 2 arms for any safety 
parameters. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
No SAEs, no deaths and no other significant AE were reported in the studies MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002. 
In the Study MYL-Her-3001, over 48 weeks, the incidence of SAEs was similar in the treatment groups: 167 
events in 97 patients (39.3%) in the MYL-1401O arm, and 163 events in 91 patients (37.0%) in the Herceptin 
arm (Table 42). The majority reported SAEs were in the SOC of Blood and lymphatic system disorders (111 
events in MYL-1401O, and 103 events in Herceptin).

At the PT level, the most frequently reported SAE were: 
-  Neutropenia with 68 patients (27.5%, 92 events) in the MYL-1401O arm and 62 patients (25.2%, 78 
events) in the Herceptin arm; nearly all of them were Grade 4. 
- 
- 
- 
Febrile neutropenia: 11 patients (4.5%, 13 events) in the MYL-1401O arm and 10 patients (4.1%, 11 
events) in the Herceptin arm.  
Leukopenia: 5 patients (2%, 5 events) in the MYL-1401O arm and 12 patients (4.9%, 13 events) in the 
Herceptin arm. 
Pneumonia: 6 patients (2.4%, 6 events) in the MYL-1401O arm and 5 patients (2%, 5 events) in the 
Herceptin arm. 
Generally, the vast majority of SAEs occurred in Part 1 of the study while patients were receiving combination 
therapy, and, in Part 2, there were no SAEs in the Blood and lymphatic disorder SOC (and thus no neutropenia 
SAEs). The majority of SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug. Nevertheless, more SAEs (11 SAEs in 9 
patients)  in  the  MYL-1401O  arm  than  in  the  Herceptin  arm  (6  SAEs  in  4  patients)  were  attributed  by  the 
Investigators to the study drug. Most SAEs that began in Part 1 resolved or resolved with sequelae, except for 
those that were fatal. In general, the number and type of SAEs were those expected for this patient population, 
and  there  were  no  notable  differences  in  SAEs  between  the  treatment  arms.  Two  SUSARs  were  reported 
(accelerated hypertension and pneumothorax spontaneous, both in Part 1). 
In the supportive study BM200 CT3-001-11, incidence of serious adverse events was observed to be lower in the 
Bmab-200 arm over the course of the trial: 11 patients with treatment-emergent SAEs in the Bmab-200 arm 
(16.67%, 16 events) vs 20 in the Herceptin arm (29.41%, 28 events). 
In the Bmab-200 arm, the SOC with the most frequent treatment-emergent SAEs was general disorders and 
administration  site  conditions  (9.09%);  the  events  reported  being:  disease  progression,  infusion  related 
reaction, and multi-organ failure (all occurred once in 1 patient each); fatigue (occurred twice in 1 patient); and 
pyrexia (occurred once in 2 patients). The SOC injury, poisoning and procedural complications was second most 
prevalent; the events reported being: animal bite and clavicle fracture (once in 1 patient each). 
In the Herceptin arm, the SOC with the most frequent treatment-emergent SAEs was infections and infestations 
(7.35%); the events reported being: lower respiratory tract infection and sepsis (all occurred once in 1 patient 
each); gastroenteritis (4 events in 3 patients). The SOC general disorders and administration site conditions was 
the  second  most  prevalent  (5.88%);  the  events  reported  being:  disease  progression  (occurred  once  in  1 
patient) and pyrexia (occurred once in 3 patients). 
The incidence of SAE, severe SAE, and treatment-related SAE was observed to be slightly lower in the Bmab-200 
arm than in the Herceptin arm (Table 43). In both arms, the majority of patients with SAE had SAEs deemed 
unrelated to study drug (Bmab-200, 15.15%; Herceptin, 17.65%).

Deaths 
In MYL-Her-3001, for Part 1 and 2 through Week 48, 10 patients experienced fatal TEAEs, 6 in the MYL-1401O 
arm (2.4%, 8 events) and 4 in the Herceptin arm (1.6%, 6 events) . 
For the part 2 monotherapy patients, 2 patients in the MYL-1401O arm experienced 1 fatal TEAE each (none in 
the Herceptin arm); however, neither event was considered related to study drug by the Investigator. Most of 
the  remaining  fatal  events  (part  1:  4  deaths  in  each  arm)  were  considered  related  to  taxane,  concomitant 
medication, or underlying or progressive disease. Only 1 event of respiratory failure in each arm was considered 
as possibly related to the study drug. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Infusion Reactions, Allergic-like Reactions, and Hypersensitivity 
In MYL-Her-3001, over 48 weeks, a total of 67 events were documented for infusion related reactions (IRRs), 
anaphylactic reaction, drug hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity. In both treatment groups the majority of the 
events were unrelated to treatment (MYL-1401O 66.7% [26 unrelated events out of 39 events], Herceptin 
71.4% [20/28]). For note: Only 1 patient in the Herceptin group experienced an IRR during Part 2. 
The incidence of infusion-related reactions was low but slightly higher in MYL-1401O (30 events in 17 patients 
– 6.9%) compared to Herceptin (20 events in 12 patients – 4.9%). Fifteen patients (3.0%) had IRRs that were 
considered related to trastuzumab, 9 in the MYL-1401O arm and 6 in the Herceptin arm. The majority of these 
occurred in the first cycle, and all of the IRRs resolved the same day of onset with interruption of the infusion 
and/or conservative treatment. The nature and severity of these reactions were consistent with known 
trastuzumab and taxane infusion reactions and do not yield any new safety concerns. 
The  other  most  frequently  reported  significant  TEAE  was  hypersensitivity  in  12  patients  (2.4%),  where  the 
incidence was similar between treatment arms. Most of these events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity, and the 
majority of TEAEs hypersensitivity was considered not related to study drug.  
Two anaphylactic reaction events were reported in 2 patients in the MYL-1401O arm (none in the Herceptin 
arm).  Both  were  reported  as  SAEs  of  Grade  3  intensity,  and  both  events  resolved;  1  event  was  considered 
related to MYL-1401O and resolved on the same day, the other event was unrelated to MYL-1401O but was 
considered  related  to  concomitant  medication  (piperacillin/tazobactam).  Anaphylactic  reactions  are  known 
effects associated with trastuzumab. 
In  the  Study  BM200  CT3-001-11,  infusion  reactions,  which  were  adjudged  as  AEs  related  to  infusion,  were 
comparable in both arms. 8 patients (12.12%) in Bmab-200 arm and 10 patients (14.71%) in Herceptin arm 
reported  at  least  one  AE  which  is  related  to  the  study  drug  infusion.  The  most  frequently  reported  event 
considered related to study drug infusions by investigators was pyrexia for both treatment arms (6.06% in the 
Bmab-200 arm and 5.88% in the Herceptin arm). The majority of the infusion-related reactions were mild to 
moderate in severity. No severe anaphylactic reactions were reported in either treatment arm. 
Pulmonary toxicity 
In MYL-Her-3001, over 48 weeks, the incidence of significant TEAEs of pulmonary toxicity (including dyspnea, 
dyspnea exertional, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure) was low and similar in 
each arm: 41 events in 32 patients (13%) in MYL-1401O arm, and 43 events in 30 patients (12.2%). Of these 
significant  TEAEs,  dyspnea  (6.9%  in  MYL-1401O  and  7.3%  in  Herceptin),  pneumonia  (2.8%/4.1%),  and 
pneumonitis (1.6%/0.8%) were reported more frequently. Most of the TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 103/128 
  
  
incidence of Grade 3 or greater TEAEs, and of SAE was similar between the 2 arms. The majority of TEAEs of 
potential of pulmonary toxicity were considered not to be related to the study drug and related to the taxane. 
Five fatal events were related to pulmonary toxicity: 4 during part 1 (1 fatal pneumonia in Herceptin arm and 3 
events of respiratory failure: 2 in MYL-1401O and 1 in Herceptin), and 1 during part 2 monotherapy (dyspnea in 
MYL-1401O). Two fatal AEs of respiratory failure were considered to be possibly related to the study drug (1 in 
each arm). 
Most events indicating pulmonary toxicity occurred during taxane therapy in Part 1. 
In the Study BM200 CT3-001-11, 13 patients (19.70%) in the Bmab-200 arm and 14 patients (20.59%) in the 
Herceptin arm reported at least 1 TEAE related to the SOC Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The 
frequent pulmonary events reported for Bmab-200 were cough (12.12%), exertional dyspnoea (4.55%), and 
pleural  effusion  (4.55%);  and  for  Herceptin  were  cough  (13.24%),  dyspnoea  (2.94%),  and  pneumonitis 
(2.94%). No fatal events were related to pulmonary toxicity. 
Cardiac toxicity 
In MYL-Her-3001, patients with abnormal LVEF and significant cardiac problems at baseline were excluded from 
the study (inclusion criterion 12 and exclusion criterion 6). 
Over 48 weeks, the incidence of significant TEAEs of cardiac toxicity (including cardiac failure, cardiotoxicity, left 
ventricular  dysfunction,  and  metabolic  cardiomyopathy)  was  low  and  similar  in  each  arm:  13  events  in  12 
patients (4.9%) in MYL-1401O, and 10 events in 10 patients (4.1%) in Herceptin. There were more cardiac 
failure in MYL-1401O (6 events in 6 patients – 2.4%) than in Herceptin (1 event in 1 patient – 0.4%). There were 
also  more  Grade  3  or  greater  TEAE  in  the  MYL-1401O  arm  (6  events:  3  cardiac  failure,  1  carditis,  2  left 
ventricular dysfunction, including 2 fatal cases) than in the Herceptin arm (1 left ventricular dysfunction). There 
were  3  SAE  in  the  MYL-1401O  arm  (2  cardiac  failure,  and  1  carditis),  and  none  in  the  Herceptin  arm.  The 
majority  of  cardiac  toxicity  TEAEs  were  considered  related  to  study  drug  in  both  arms:  8  related  TEAE  in 
MYL-1401O (including 4 cardiac failure), and 6 in Herceptin. 
In addition, the following results were obtained for the ejection fraction decreased: TEAEs (all unrelated) 
MYL-1401O 12 patients (4.9%, 16 events), Herceptin 7 patients (2.8%, 8 events); Grade 3 or greater 
MYL-1401O 1 patient (0.4%, 1 event), Herceptin 1 (0.4 %, 1 event); SAE MYL-1401O 1 patient (0.4 %, 1 
event), Herceptin 0).  
Around 69% of the cardiac events occurred during Part 1 while patients received combination therapy. 
One event of cardiac failure was fatal (Grade 5). This fatal event was considered unlikely related to study drug 
(unknown cause); the patient also had concurrent fatal respiratory failure. No fatal events due to cardiac toxicity 
have been reported in the Herceptin arm. 
Mean, median, minimum and maximum LVEF values did not change appreciably from Baseline to Week 48 for 
either treatment group, and were similar between treatment groups. Few patients, 10 (4.0%) in the MYL-1401O 
group and 8 (3.3%) patients in the Herceptin group, had drops in LVEF below 50% during the study. Most of 
these patients had previously received anthracyclines, had a previous or concomitant cardiovascular disorder, 
previous thoracic radiation, diabetes mellitus, or high levels of blood pressure. 
Finally, out of the 5 TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation for at least 2 patients, 6 TEAEs were related to 
cardiac toxicity: 3 patients with cardiac failure in MYL-1401O (none in Herceptin) and 3 patients with ejection 
fraction decreased (2 patients in the MYL-1401O arm and 1 patient in the Herceptin arm).

No notable differences between treatment groups were observed for ECG results. 
In the Study BM200 CT3-001-11, a small number of patients in both arms showed abnormal ECG findings during 
the course of study, but they were not clinically significant (9 patients in the MYL-1401O arm and 9 patients in 
the Herceptin arm). Although there were no observations of symptomatic congestive heart failure in the trial, 2 
(3.03%) patients in Bmab-200 arm and 4 (5.88%) patients in Herceptin arm reported to have clinically 
significant reduction in ejection fraction (LVEF); these were reported as TEAEs. 1 patient (1.52%) in Bmab-200 
arm had a TEAE of palpitations that was considered an infusion-related reaction by the Investigator; the 
patient’s palpitations completely resolved. The incidence of cardiovascular events in the Bmab-200 arm was 
marginally lower than that in the Herceptin arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In MYL-Her-3001, there were no notable differences in shifts of haematology parameters between treatment 
arms from baseline through Week 48.  
In the MYL-Her-3001 study, of the significant TEAEs of hematologic toxicity through Week 48, including all PTs 
within  the  system  organ  class  of  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  neutropenia  was  reported  most 
frequently (56.0%) and occurred in similar frequencies in both treatment arms. Most of these TEAEs were Grade 
1 or 2 in intensity. The majority of these blood and lymphatic system disorder events were considered unrelated 
to study drug. Many of these TEAEs are known side effects of taxanes. Notably, most of these TEAEs were not 
present  during  monotherapy  with  trastuzumab.  For  Part  1  and  2  overall,  the  SOC  with  the  most  frequently 
reported SAEs was Blood and lymphatic system disorders: 79 patients (32%) with 111 events in MYL-1401O, 
and 70 patients (28.5%) with 103 events in Herceptin. At the PT level, the most frequently reported SAE was 
neutropenia: 68 patients (27.5%) with 92 events in MYL-1401O, and 62 patients (25.2%) with 78 events in 
Herceptin. In Part 2, there were no SAEs in the Blood and lymphatic disorder SOC (and thus no neutropenia 
SAEs). 
Of these, 167 SAEs of neutropenia were considered Grade 4 in intensity, 91 events in the MYL-1401O arm and 
76 events in the Herceptin arm. All of these SAEs resolved or resolved with sequelae and were considered not 
related to study drug. Most were considered related to taxanes. Of these neutropenia SAE, only 1 event caused 
discontinuation of taxane treatment in the MYL-1401O arm.  
One pancytopenia event was fatal in the MYL-1401O arm. 
In the Study MYL-Her-1001, there were no clinically significant changes in the haematology parameters during 
the  course  of  the  study.  During  the  course  of  the  study,  1  subject  had  clinically  significant  abnormal 
haematology values (after administration of Herceptin). This subject experienced abnormally increased white 
blood  cell,  neutrophils  S,  and  monocyte  counts  at  48  hours  after  Herceptin  administration,  which  was  most 
probably likely due to nasopharyngitis. 
In the Study BM200 CT3-001-11, 7 patients (10.61%) in the Bmab-200 arm and 7 patients (10.29%) in the 
Herceptin  arm  reported  at  least  1  TEAE  related  to  the  SOC  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders.  In  the 
Bmab-200 arm, the reported TEAEs in this SOC were anaemia (7.58%), thrombocytopenia (3.03%), leukopenia 
(1.52%), and eosinophilia (1.52%). In the Herceptin arm, the reported haematological TEAEs were anaemia 
(8.82%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (1.47%). Of these, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
reported in the Herceptin arm was fatal.

Biochemistry 
In MYL-Her-3001, through 48 weeks, the frequency of abnormal results in biochemistry values was similar in 
both  treatment  arms.  The  means  and  medians,  as  well  as  shifts  based  on  longitudinal  review  of  data  from 
Baseline to Week 48, were reviewed for each parameter. No significant differences in mean, median, or any 
shifts were observed between the treatment arms for serum biochemistry parameters. 
In the Study MYL-Her-1001, of the values considered clinically significant by the investigator 48 hours after 
treatment,  most  (9)  were  increased  CRP  values  (marker  of  acute  reaction).  For  both  study  drugs,  the  CRP 
response increased with a peak at 24 h, decreasing thereafter to 48 h (but higher value still evident), with full 
recovery occurred after 8 days. 
In the Study MYL-Her-1002, no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory measurements which could 
be reasonably associated with the formulations under investigation. CRP increased in all subjects at 24 hours 
(usually within normal range) and had returned to each subject’s baseline by Day 8. A statistically significant 
difference in change from baseline at 24 hours and 48 hours was noted between MYL-1401O and US-licensed 
Herceptin,  and  between  EU-approved  Herceptin  and  US-licensed  Herceptin.  However,  there  were  no 
corresponding changes in ECGs or echocardiography. 
In the Study BM200 CT3-001-11, none of the biochemistry parameters showed any notable change in the mean 
values from baseline to week 24 in either treatment arm. The frequency of clinically significant biochemistry 
abnormalities  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms.  All  clinically  significant  abnormalities  were  reported  as 
adverse events. 
Urinary analysis 
In MYL-Her-3001, no notable differences between treatment groups in urinalysis results from Baseline through 
Week 48 were observed. 
Safety in special populations 
No cases of pregnancy were reported in MYL-Her-3001 and BM200-CT3-001-11. 
In MYL-Her-3001, statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the frequencies of some 
TEAEs were observed for patients < 65 years of age through 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, for instance for 
nausea (through 24 weeks - 20.9% of MYL-1401O patients versus 11.1% of Herceptin patients and through 48 
weeks - 21.9% of MYL-1401O patients versus 12.1% of Herceptin patients), upper respiratory tract infection 
(through 24 weeks 6.0% of MYL-1401O patients versus 1.0% of Herceptin patients, through 48 weeks - 7.5% 
of MYL-1401O patients versus 1.4% of Herceptin patients), arthralgia (through 24 weeks-11.4% of MYL-1401O 
patients versus 3.9% of Herceptin patients; through 48 weeks-12.9% of MYL-1401O patients versus 5.3% of 
Herceptin patients).  
The incidences of AEs and SAEs by geographical region were analysed by the Applicant. No significant 
differences have been observed. There is no clear indication from the provided data that potential differences in 
clinical practice and/or reporting might interfere in the comparability exercise.

Immunological events 
Study MYL-Her-3001 
Analysis of all patients 
As part of the immunogenicity assessment of MYL-1401O, samples were tested for the presence of ADA and NAb 
through Week 48. Samples for the determination of ADA were taken at Baseline (Cycle 1 Week 0), Cycle 3 Week 
6, Cycle 5 Week 12, Cycle 7 Week 18, Cycle 9 Week 24, Cycle 13 Week 36, Cycle 17 Week 48.  
Table 44 presents a summary of the ADA results by visit and treatment.

Prior to dosing (baseline), 14 of the 237 patients (14/237, 5.9%) with results available were positive for ADA in 
MYL-1401O group and 22 (22/240, 9.2%) were positive for ADA in the Herceptin group.  
Given  the  type  of  patient  population  and  study  protocol,  the  number  of  patients  continuing  in  the  study 
decreased over time, thus the number of samples available for immunogenicity assessment also decreased over 
time. The number of ADA-positive samples and proportion at each time point are calculated.  
With regard to NAb analysis, confirmed positive ADA samples were further tested using a validated cell based 
NAb assay. Table 45 presents a summary of the NAb results by visit and treatment.

At baseline, of the patients who were ADA positive, NAbs were detected in 1 patient in the MYL-1401O group and 
in 2 patients in the Herceptin group. Post-baseline, the only Nab-positive sample were observed at week 6 (3 
samples in Herceptin), and week 36 (1 sample in MYL-1401O). 
The overall ADA and NAb rate was calculated using a conservative approach, which considers all patients who 
tested positive for ADA or NAb at least once at any time point post-baseline regardless of the ADA result at 
baseline (Table 46).  
Table 42: Summary of Overall ADA and NAb Rate (Includes Part 1 and 2 Through Week 48): Safety Population 
Analysis of patients excluding ADA baseline-positive patients 
Given  that  6-9%  of  patients  (36/477,  Table  45)  had  pre-existing  antibodies  against  the  test  and  reference 
product  prior  to  study  entry,  an  additional  analysis  that  excluded  these  subjects  was  conducted.  Table  47 
presents a summary of the treatment-induced ADA-positive samples by visit and treatment.

Table 43: Summary of ADA Results by Visit and Treatment Excluding ADA Baseline-Positive Patients (Includes 
Part 1 and 2 Through Week 48): Safety Population 
The treatment-induced ADA rate was calculated based on baseline ADA-negative patients (or patients with no 
baseline results) who tested positive for ADA at least once at any time point post-baseline. The 
treatment-induced NAb rate was calculated based on baseline Nab negative patients (or patients with no 
baseline results) who tested positive for NAb at least once at any time point post-baseline. For the 
treatment-induced NAb rate also patients were included who were ADA-positive (but NAb-negative) at baseline. 
These results are presented in Table 48. The Nab positivity was isolated and, in this small group of patients, 
none of them had positivity at more than one post-baseline time-point.

Overall, ADA titers were low in both arms across all time points. The highest pre-dose ADA titers obtained were 
7.1 and 6.9, respectively, in the MYL-1401O and Herceptin arms. The highest post-dose ADA titers obtained 
were 11.5 and 5.5, respectively, in the MYL-1401O and Herceptin arms.  
During the treatment with MYL-14010, 6 patients had ADA-positive samples. From them, only 2 were positive at 
baseline. Three were still positive at week 36 (with 1 Nab-positive sample), but none at week 48 presented an 
increase of ADA titer during the treatment. 
During the treatment with Herceptin, more patients had ADA-positive samples (9) than with MYL-1401O. From 
them, 6 were positive at baseline. Only 1 was still positive at week 36 (Nab-negative sample), and none at week 
48. No sample with continued increase of ADA-titer is seen. 
Administration-related reactions by ADA status 
A summary of administration-related reactions (ARRs) by ADA status is presented in Table 50.  
Table 46: Summary of Administration-related Reactions by ADA Status: Safety Population 
Of  the  19  patients  who  were  ADA-positive  post-baseline  (irrespectively  of  ADA  results  at  baseline:  9  in 
MYL-1401O and 10 in Herceptin), only 1 patient each in the MYL-1401O and Herceptin arm experienced 1 or 
more  ARRs.  Furthermore,  of  the  patients  experiencing  ARR, only  4.8%  (1/21)  in  the  MYL-1401O  and  7.1% 
(1/14) in Herceptin arm were ADA-positive indicating that most patients experiencing ARR were ADA negative. 
Study MYL-Her-1001  
The immunogenicity of MYL-1401O and Herceptin was assessed by evaluating the incidence and the ADA levels 
in  blood  samples  collected  at  baseline  (preinfusion,  at  0  hours)  and  at  2  weeks  and  10  weeks  during  each 
treatment  period.  All  post-baseline  sera  collected  for  ADA  in  this  study  were  negative,  and  there  was  no 
indication  of  immunogenicity  in  this  population  of  healthy  volunteers  after  administration  of  MYL-1401O  or 
Herceptin.

Study MYL-Her-1002  
The occurrence of ADA-positive samples was low for each of the drug products administered and, based on the 
titer,  they  were  then  re-classified  as  ADA-negative  subjects.  There  were  no  instances  of  either 
treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA-positive subjects in the study. 
Study BM200 CT3-001-11  
Immunogenicity to trastuzumab was assessed in both arms using assays to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA). 
The presence of antibody, as well as antibody titre, was measured. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at 
12 weeks and at the end of the trial (24 weeks) (Table 51 below). 
Table 47: Immunogenicity Incidence of Positive Anti-Drug Antibody by treatment group in safety population 
(Confirmatory Assay; Study BM200-CT3-001-11) 
At baseline, 4 patients were seropositive in each arm. However, in the Herceptin arm, all these patients became 
sero-negative while on treatment. Since all patients were treatment-naïve for Herceptin, it is likely that the 
baseline results represent false positives resulting from assay interference. 
Two patients (3.03%) in the Bmab-200 arm tested positive for ADA at 12 weeks and only 1 (1.52%) at week 24. 
For this patient, the titres dropped from week 12 to week 24 (4 fold to 1 fold) and can be considered weakly 
positive for ADA; hence these data are of limited clinical significance. In corroboration, these two ADA-positive 
patients did not experience any infusion reactions over the duration of the trial. 
The clinical trial was not powered to detect differences in comparative immunogenicity between Herceptin and 
Bmab-200. Overall the ADA positivity rate (3.03%, 2/66 subjects) observed for the Bmab-200 arm was similar 
to the rate reported for Herceptin (3.4%, 10/295 subjects) (Ismael et al, 2012). 
No autoimmune adverse events (lupus, demyelinating disorders) were reported in the clinical program. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study MYL-Her-3001 
Overall, in MYL-Her-3001 (trough week 48), the incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was 
slightly higher in the Herceptin arm (27 events in 16 patients, 6.5%) than in the MYL-1401O arm (14 events in 
10 patients, 4%) . From them, there were 4 treatment-related TEAE in 4 patients (1.6%) in MYL-1501O and 4 
events in 3 patients (1.2%) in Herceptin.

Only 5 TEAEs resulted in treatment discontinuation for at least 2 patients each: cardiac failure (3 patients in the 
MYL-1401O arm), ejection fraction decreased (2 patients in the MYL-1401O arm and 1 patient in the Herceptin 
arm), dizziness, pneumonitis and pneumonia (2 patients each in the Herceptin arm), dyspnea (1 patient in the 
MYL-1401O arm and 2 patients in the Herceptin arm), and respiratory failure (1 patient in each arm).  
In  the  studies  MYL-Her-1001  and  MYL-Her-1002,  no  serious  TEAEs  were  reported,  and  no  subjects  were 
withdrawn from the study due to TEAEs.  
In the Study BM200 CT3-001-11, excluding AEs related to disease progression, 1 TEAE led to withdrawal from 
the study in the Herceptin arm: a moderate TEAE of ejection fraction decreased, which was considered to be 
definitely related to the drug. 
Interruption  
In MYL-Her-3001, over 48 weeks, 27 events leading to interruption of study drug were reported in 23 patients. 
The incidence of these TEAEs was similar between treatment arms, 12 patients (4.9%) in the MYL-1401O arm 
and 11 patients (4.5%) in the Herceptin arm. Of these, 21 events in 19 patients were considered treatment 
related, 11 patients (4.5%) in the MYL-1401O arm and 8 patients (3.3%) in the Herceptin arm. The only related 
TEAEs occurring in more than 1 patient were hypersensitivity (2 patients in the MYL-1401O arm and 1 patient in 
the  Herceptin  arm)  and  infusion  related  reaction  (5  patients  in  the  MYL-1401O  arm  and  4  patients  in  the 
Herceptin arm).

Post marketing experience 
Biocon Limited (co-development partner of Mylan) received marketing authorisation for another formulation in 
India.  This  formulation  has  been  available  on  the  Indian  market  since  January  2014.  Sales  data  indicate  a 
patient exposure of more than 5000-patient treatment courses since launch of the product. 
Safety information received from the post approval exposure is being continuously evaluated and analysed for 
inclusion in the Periodic Safety Update Reports as per local regulations. Periodic review of this safety data does 
not indicate any new safety signals from the post-approval experience of more than 2 years. None of the articles 
screened during the worldwide literature review contained safety information indicating a newly identified or 
potential risk with trastuzumab. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main comparative data in terms of safety were generated in the pivotal study MYL-Her-3001 in patients with 
HER2-positive  metastatic  breast  cancer  involving  247  patients  exposed  to  MYL-1401O,  out  of  whom  185 
patients completed Part 1 of the study (MYL-1401O + taxanes, docetaxel or paclitaxel, for 24 weeks), and 116 
patients completed Part 2 (MYL-1401O monotherapy: 24 to 48 weeks). A comparable number of patients was 
exposed to EU Herceptin. 
Additionally,  63  healthy  volunteers  received  one  dose  of  MYL-1401O  in  2  PK  studies  (MYL-Her-1001  and 
MYL-Her-1002)  which  can  only  contribute  to  evaluation  of  short  term  safety.  Moreover,  a  fourth  supportive 
clinical  study  (BM200-CT3-001-11)  was  conducted  with  another  formulation.  66  patients  were  exposed  to 
Bmab-200 and 68 to EU Herceptin. 
The size of the safety database is considered appropriate to evaluate the general safety profile of MYL-Her-3001. 
Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations with size of the biosimilar product safety database for the purpose 
of characterisation and evaluation of rare events of special interest. 
In terms of treatment duration, safety data through 48 weeks (Parts 1 & 2) of Study MYL-Her-3001 were 
provided. It is considered that the current safety database is sufficient to allow for adequate assessment of the 
safety of MYL-1401O compared to that of the reference product. 
In part 1, given concomitant administration with chemotherapy, the sensitivity for detecting potential 
differences in safety profiles may be diminished, but this setting is nevertheless suitable for initial comparability 
exercise provided that the most homogeneous population of patients is enrolled. In Part 2 of the study (24 to 48 
weeks), after completing a minimum of 8 cycles of treatment in Part 1 of the study, all patients with at least 
stable disease continue with the trastuzumab product that they were originally allocated to as a single agent 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Since Herceptin and Ogivri will be used as monotherapy, part 
2 comparative analysis without concomitant chemotherapy backbone is informative.  
In summary, as expected for comparative studies, in MYL-Her-1001 and MYL-Her-1002, the cumulative dose of 
MYL-1401O is very close to the cumulative dose of Herceptin. In BM200 CT3-001-11, the extent of exposure (to 
trastuzumab and docetaxel) was similar between the 2 treatment groups (Bmab-200 and Herceptin). 
In MYL-Her-3001, the cumulative dose of trastuzumab in Part 1 of the study (24 weeks) was similar in both 
arms, but over a 48 week treatment duration (parts 1 & 2), the cumulative dose of MYL-1401O was slightly 
higher than Herceptin (median of 2 trastuzumab cycles more), and it can be deduced that the difference of 
exposure occurred during part 2 (monotherapy). As discussed below, the safety profile during Part 2 of the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 116/128 
  
  
was similar in both treatment arms, therefore, the difference in the cumulative dose does not seem to have a 
specific effect on the safety profile. 
In part 2, the safety population included all patients who entered in part 2 and consisted of 342 patients (179 in 
the MYL-1401O arm and 163 in the Herceptin arm). From them, 32 patients (15 patients in MYL-1401O and 17 
in Herceptin) entered Part 2 and continued using taxane before they switched to trastuzumab monotherapy 
during Part 2. Continuation of combination therapy and switch to monotherapy, based on potential benefit for 
the patient, was at the discretion of the Investigator. 
With regards to taxane use through 48 weeks, majority of the patients (~88%) received docetaxel and the 
cumulative dose of docetaxel was similar in both arms. In the paclitaxel group (~12% patients), the overall 
exposure to paclitaxel was higher in the MYL-1401O arm compared to Herceptin arm. As discussed below, 
similarity has been shown in terms of safety between the biosimilar and the originator through 48 weeks, with 
some observed differences. As these differences, have not been seen in part 2 (monotherapy), this higher 
exposure to paclitaxel in MYL-1401O compared to Herceptin might play a role. 
At each cycle (between 1 and 17 cycles), slightly more patients were treated in the MYL-1401O arm than in the 
Herceptin arm. The difference is globally increasing with the number of cycles (to around 53% patients in the 
MYL-1401O arm compared to 47% in the Herceptin arm at cycle 17). As the safety profile is similar during part 
2 (monotherapy) between the 2 arms with a low number of TEAE, this difference should not impact the 
comparability exercise.  
Similarity has been observed in terms of safety between the biosimilar and the originator at longer term 
(MYL-Her-3001 48 weeks). Overall, MYL-1401O and Herceptin safety profiles, when administered with a taxane 
as first-line therapy to patients with HER2+ MBC, and when given as monotherapy, were similar without any 
new safety concerns observed with MYL-1401O. Nevertheless, some differences have been observed. In the 
Myl-1401O arm compared to in the Herceptin arm, there were slightly more TEAE (2639 and 2376 events, 
respectively) but similar number of patients with TEAE: 98% and 97.2%, respectively. There were few noted 
differences (> 5%) in the incidence of TEAEs between the treatment arms, including nausea, asthenia, 
arthralgia, and upper respiratory tract infection in the MYL-1401O arm compared to the Herceptin arm. 
Moreover, in the MYL-1401O arm compared to in the Herceptin arm, there were more treatment-related TEAE 
(356 and 273 events, respectively) and more patients with treatment-related TEAE; 103 patients (41.7%) and 
88 patients (35.8%), respectively. The reason of these slight differences is unclear, whether these should be 
attributed to differences in underlying properties of the biologics being evaluated or to chance finding, especially 
in studies that are not powered to evaluate statistically meaningful differences in AEs. It could be related to a 
different excipient used or the slight difference in exposure of paclitaxel (higher in MYL-1401O than in 
Herceptin). However, as the safety profile is similar during part 2 (monotherapy) between the 2 arms with a low 
number of TEAE, the comparability is globally established between MYL-1401O and Herceptin. 
In part 1, the incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was the same in the MYL-1401O arm and 
the Herceptin arm: 7 patients (2.8%, 10 events) and 7 patients (2.8%, 17 events), respectively. From them, 
there were 3 treatment-related TEAE in 3 patients (1.2%) in MYL-1401O and 2 treatment-related TEAE in 1 
patient (0.4%) in Herceptin. In Part 2, 3 patients (1.7%, 4 events) in the MYL-1401O arm and 8 patients (4.9%, 
9 events) in the Herceptin arm experienced TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. None of the TEAEs 
leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  more  than  1  patient  each.  Three  patients  experienced  related  TEAEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation as follows: 1 patient discontinued because of cardiac failure (MYL-1401O 
arm) and 2 patients discontinued in Herceptin (cardiomyopathy and pneumonitis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 117/128 
  
  
During monotherapy treatment (part 2), the incidence of TEAEs was overall similar between treatment arms 
(MYL-1401O and Herceptin). Of the total 5015 TEAEs through Week 48, only 513 TEAEs had on onset while 
patients were receiving trastuzumab monotherapy (part 2: 257 in MYL-1401O arm and 256 in Herceptin arm), 
clearly suggesting that most of the TEAE seen over 48 weeks, were driven by data until Week 24 (part 1), and 
most likely attributable to the background taxane therapy. 
Although the incidence of significant TEAEs of cardiac toxicity was low and similar in each arm (13 events in 
MYL-1401O, and 10 events in Herceptin), there were more cardiac failure in MYL-1401O (6 events in 6 patients 
– 2.4%, 3 events were Grade 1 or 2 and 3 events were Grade 3 or greater) than in Herceptin (1 event in 1 patient 
– 0.4%), and more Grade 3 or greater TEAE in the MYL-1401O arm (6 events: 3 cardiac failure, 1 carditis, 2 left 
ventricular dysfunction; including 2 fatal cases, one of them in the monotherapy part) than in the Herceptin arm 
(1 left ventricular dysfunction). Moreover, there were 3 SAE in the MYL-1401O arm (2 cardiac failure, and 1 
carditis), and none in the Herceptin arm. And there were 3 patients in MYL-1401O who discontinued treatment 
because of cardiac failure (none in Herceptin). The majority of cardiac toxicity TEAEs were considered related to 
study drug in both arms: 8 (out of 12 patients) related TEAE in MYL-1401O (including 4 cardiac failure), and 6 
(out of 10 patients) in Herceptin. In addition, there were 12 patients (4.9%, 16 events) with ejection fraction 
decreased in MYL-1401O, compared to 7 patients (2.8%, 8 events) in Herceptin. However, the incidence of new 
onset myocardial dysfunction was similar in both treatment arms with 10 patients (4.0%) in the MYL-1401O arm 
and  8  patients  (3.3%)  in  the  Herceptin  arm  having  at  least  1  post-treatment  value  of  <50%.  Of  these  18 
patients, 16 had LVEF of <50% and at least 10 percentage point reduction compared to baseline with a similar 
incidence (9 patients (3.6%) in the MYL-1401O arm and 7 patients (2.8%) in the Herceptin arm). These data are 
consistent with historical data from prior studies with Herceptin.  
For  the  comparability  exercise  trough  48  weeks,  in  patients  with  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines,  or  in 
patients without previous exposure to anthracyclines, although some isolated statistically significant differences 
of  frequencies  have  been  noticed  at  PT  level  between  treatment  groups,  the  TEAE  frequencies  were  mostly 
similar (no SOC with statistically significant differences for the common TEAE) between arms (MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin). 
Over 24 weeks (part 1), in patients co-treated with paclitaxel, or in patients co-treated with docetaxel, although 
some isolated statistically significant differences of frequencies have been noticed at PT level between treatment 
groups,  the  TEAE  frequencies  were  mostly  similar  (no  SOC  with  statistically  significant  differences  for  the 
common TEAE) between arms (MYL-1401O and Herceptin). 
Over 48 weeks (parts 1 & 2), in patients co-treated with paclitaxel, or in patients co-treated with docetaxel, the 
TEAE frequencies were very closed to the frequencies observed over 24 weeks (with a similar distribution 
between arms with some isolated statistically significant differences). As seen for the overall population (treated 
with paclitaxel or docetaxel), it can be conclude that the majority of the observed TEAE over 48 weeks (with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel) were already observed during the first 24 weeks (part 1). 
In MYL-Her-3001, statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the frequencies of some 
TEAEs were observed for patients < 65 years of age through 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. These differences 
were considered attributable to co-treatment with chemotherapy, concomitant medications, and comorbidities, 
which is a plausible explanation. Such differences were not observed in the older age group or in the 
monotherapy setting. 
As part of the immunogenicity assessment of MYL-1401O, samples were tested for the presence of ADA and NAb 
through Week 48 in MYL-Her-3001. The number of ADA-positive patients, which was 14 samples in MYL-1401O 
and 22 samples in Herceptin at baseline, declined over time. A similar baseline ADA-positive rate was observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 118/128 
  
  
in previous clinical studies with the originator product. Baseline positivity may be due to presence of pre-existing 
antibodies or ADA assay interference with high levels of extracellular domain of HER2 receptor (HER2 ECD). 
The maximum proportion of ADA-positive patients post-baseline was seen at Week 6 and was 5 samples in 
MYL-1401O and 6 samples in Herceptin. At the Week 48 time-point, none of the patients in either arms were 
ADA-positive. 
At baseline, of the patients who were ADA positive, NAbs were detected in 1 patient in the MYL-1401O group and 
in 2 patients in the Herceptin group. Post-baseline, the only Nab-positive sample were observed at week 3 (3 
samples in Herceptin), and week 38 (1 sample in MYL-1401O). 
Using a conservative approach, which considers all patients who tested positive for ADA or NAb at least once at 
any time point post-baseline regardless of the ADA result at baseline, the overall ADA rate was 9 patients (3.9%) 
in the MYL-1401O arm (out of 228 patients with non-missing post-baseline samples available) and 10 patients 
(4.4%) in the Herceptin arm (out of 227 patients with non-missing post-baseline samples available). The overall 
NAb  rate  was  very  low  with  1  patient  (0.4%)  and  3  patients  (1.3%)  in  MYL-1401O  and  Herceptin  arms 
respectively. 
The treatment-induced ADA rate, excluding patients who were ADA-positive at baseline, in the MYL-1401O arm 
was 1.7% (4 patients) and 1.8% (4 patients) in the Herceptin arm. The treatment-induced NAb rate, excluding 
patients who were NAb-positive at baseline, was 0.4% (1 patient) and 0.9 % (2 patients) in the MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin arms respectively. 
Overall, ADA titers were low in both arms across all time points. The highest pre-dose ADA titers obtained were 
7.1 and 6.9, respectively, in the MYL-1401O and Herceptin arms. The highest post-dose ADA titers obtained 
were 11.5 and 5.5, respectively, in the MYL-1401O and Herceptin arms.  
Because of the low number of ADA-positive samples, there are no consistent trends that would be of relevance 
by comparing immunogenicity in monotherapy (part 2) to immunogenicity in treatment combined with taxanes 
(part 1), or by comparing the evolution of the immunogenicity (ADA- and Nab-positive samples and ADA titers) 
between arms (MYL-1401O and Herceptin). 
Finally, the analysis of administration-related reactions (ARRs) by ADA status indicates that there is no specific 
correlation between the 2 parameters. 
According  to  the  HannaH  study  (Ismael  et  al.  2012,  Hegg  et  al.,  2012),  the  percentage  of  ADA  was  3.4% 
(10/295 patients) after intravenous use regardless of baseline ADA status in patients with early breast cancer 
when  trastuzumab  was  used  in  combination  of  docetaxel.  Of  the  patients  who  had  confirmed  positive  ADA 
responses to trastuzumab at baseline, NAbs were detected in one patient. Therefore, it is not unexpected to 
have  NAb-positive  results  at  baseline.  Of  note,  in  the  neoadjuvant-adjuvant  EBC  treatment  setting,  8.1  % 
(24/296)  of  patients  treated  with  trastuzumab  intravenous  developed  antibodies  against  trastuzumab 
(regardless  of  antibody  presence  at  baseline).  NAb  were  detected  in  post-baseline  samples  in  2  of  24 
trastuzumab intravenous patients.  
In summary, through 48 weeks, the incidence of antidrug antibodies against MYL-1401O and Herceptin was very 
low and consistent with literature. These antibodies were transient and the titers were low. Also the incidence of 
neutralizing  antibodies  was  very  low  and  similar  in  both  arms.  Overall,  the  treatment-emergent  immune 
response was similar between the 2 treatment arms. No association was observed between the presence of 
ADAs and ARRs.

The  immunoassays  to  measure  ADA  and  Nab,  their  validation,  and  the  relation  between  ADA  and  the 
trastuzumab clearance are discussed in the section on pharmacokinetics. 
The applicant discussed the current knowledge on the safety profile of the excipient used in the final formulation, 
Macrogol 3350, when included in IV formulations at clinical relevant doses and the observed hypersensitivity 
reactions. While initially considered as immunologically safe, macrogols, have been increasingly associated with 
cases of mild to life-threatening immediate-type hypersensitivity (Wenande and Garvey, 2016). Due to a lack of 
suspicion  towards  excipients,  awareness  of  PEGs  allergenic  potential  is  minimal  leading  to  unrecognised 
potential risk of life-threatening reactions and misdiagnosis. In recent years more report appeared in literature, 
including immediate type reactions to macrogol 3350 (Wylon et al, 2016). Two cases of a reaction after receiving 
IM injections of medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), containing as excipients macrogol 3350 and polysorbate 
have been related to previous treatment with a drug conjugated with PEG. These two subjects reported serious 
AEs (SAEs) that were assessed as moderate in severity (Longo et al, 2014). Both SAEs were categorized as 
immune system disorders of anaphylactic reaction: urticaria for one subject and hypersensitivity (an allergic 
reaction) for another subject. Concerning the mechanisms of reactions mediated by PEGs, Ig-E/M/G mediated 
mechanisms  and  complement  activation  have  been  proposed  (Schellekens  e  al,  2013;  Wylon  et  al,  2016; 
Hamad et al, 2008). Results of the study Hamad et al (2008) provides a plausible explanation to the previously 
reported unexplained anaphylaxis or the referred cardiovascular collapse in sensitive animals that have received 
medicines  containing  high  levels  of  PEG  as  solubilizer/carrier.  The  Applicant  presented  preclinical,  clinical, 
toxicity and safety data with Macrogol as well as infusion-related data from MYL-1401O. These data revealed no 
major difference in hypersensitivity events or infusion related reactions between MYL-1401O and Herceptin in 
the clinical program. The CHMP concludes that the information in sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Herceptin 
SmPC are sufficient to address the potential risks associated with the administration of MYL-1401O. 
The dose of sorbitol used as an excipient will be less than 0.5 g and thus limiting the potential risk of toxicity. The 
intended use of Ogivri only in adult patients suggests that most of the patients will be aware of their medical 
history of hereditary fructose intolerance. The applicant also included a warning in the SmPC for patients with 
the rare genetic disorder of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), in accordance with the guideline for excipients 
labelling.  
The  applicant  claimed  the  same  therapeutic  indications  for  the  biosimilar  as  granted  for  Herceptin  for 
intravenous administration in the EU. Considering Herceptin is also marketed for subcutaneous administration, 
adequate risk minimisation measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in 
the SmPC section 4.2. 
From the safety database of trastuzumab all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics of Ogivri which follows the one of Herceptin. 
Furthermore, the RMP of Ogivri adequately addresses the safety concerns of trastuzumab, in line with Herceptin. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The data up to 48 weeks in the pivotal trial MYL-Her-3001 indicate a similar safety profile between biosimilar 
candidate MYL-1401O and reference product Herceptin despite a slightly higher number of patients with 
treatment-related TEAE in the MYL-1401O arm (103 patients [41.7%] vs 88 patients [35.8%]). Most of the 
TEAE seen over 48 weeks, were driven by data until Week 24 (part 1), and most likely attributable to the 
background taxane therapy. The observed AE and SAE were as expected for trastuzumab and chemotherapy 
combination.  
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 120/128 
  
  
The results indicated that there was no clinically meaningful difference between MYL-1401O and Herceptin in 
terms of immunogenicity and that these data are consistent with the literature (low immunogenic potential of 
the innovator product). 
In conclusion, the treatment of MBC patients with MYL-1401O is well tolerated (in combination with taxanes or 
in monotherapy), with a low immunogenicity, and no new or unexpected safety signals were observed compared 
to Herceptin-EU. Therefore, the long term one-year safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of MYL-1401O and 
Herceptin are comparable.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Ogivri is developed as a biosimilar to Herceptin. The approval is sought for intravenous use in all approved 
indications of the reference product: metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer 
(see SmPC).  
In  support  of  the  application,  the  applicant  provided  results  from  an  extensive  comparability  analysis  to 
demonstrate  biosimilarity  to  the  reference  product  Herceptin.  Comprehensive  analyses  of  the  proposed 
biosimilar and reference medicinal product were carried out using sensitive and orthogonal methods covering 
biological activity, primary structure, higher order structure, product-related substances and purity/impurities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 123/128 
  
  
Data were evaluated against pre-defined similarity assessment criteria. The biological activity was evaluated by 
a  comprehensive  set  of  functional  assays  and  binding  studies  addressing  both  Fab  and  Fc-functions  of  the 
molecule. 
The  non-clinical  studies  submitted  consisted  of  in  vitro  pharmacodynamic  studies,  a  single-dose 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study in cynomolgus monkeys, and a combined 28-day repeat-dose toxicokinetic study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
To support similarity from the clinical perspective, the Applicant submitted three pivotal studies. 
•  Study MYL-Her-1001 was a single-centre, single-dose, 2-period, randomized, double-blind, crossover 
study in healthy male volunteers. The subjects either received the MYL-1401O or EU-approved 
Herceptin in Period I and an alternative treatment in Period II. The primary objective of Study 
MYL-Her-1001 was to confirm bioequivalence between MYL-1401O and Herceptin administered at a 
dose of 8 mg/kg, administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes in healthy male 
volunteers. 
•  Study MYL-Her-1002 was a single-centre, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 3- arm parallel-group 
study investigating the bioequivalence of MYL-1401O versus EU- approved Herceptin and US-licensed 
Herceptin as well as EU-approved Herceptin versus US-licensed Herceptin after 8 mg/kg as single dose 
administered as IV infusion over 90 minutes in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. 
•  Study MYL-Her-3001 is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, pivotal confirmatory 
study to compare the efficacy and safety of MYL-1401O plus docetaxel or paclitaxel (i.e., taxane) versus 
EU-approved Herceptin plus a taxane in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC; 
documented by central laboratory results) with continuation (part 2 of the study) of single-agent 
MYL-1401O versus Herceptin for patients who had at least stable disease in order to evaluate continued 
safety and immunogenicity. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
From  the  quality  perspective,  the  data  provided  indicate  that  Ogivri  can  be  considered  as  biosimilar  to 
EU-approved Herceptin at the quality level. The minor differences observed have been appropriately justified. 
From a non-clinical perspective, the in vitro assays performed on an appropriate number of batches have shown 
similarity between MYL-1401O and the EU Herceptin reference product in terms of HER 2 binding, inhibition of 
proliferation, ADCC, C1q binding, Fc receptor binding. 
As for pharmacokinetic aspects, the submitted primary PK analysis showed PK comparability of the test and 
reference products at the dose of 8 mg/kg body weight given that the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of 
both primary parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t/AUC0-∞) were well contained within the standard bioequivalence 
interval of 0.80–1.25 in studies Myl-Her-1001 and Myl-Her-1002. In addition, the terminal half-life, Vz and CL 
parameters were also similar across the groups. 
Pharmacodynamic findings support the available data for the overall comparability exercise. 
From the clinical efficacy perspective, the analysis of ORR at 24 weeks in the phase III study MYL-Her-3001 in 
metastatic breast cancer patients, showed that the differences in the response rates according to RECIST 1.1 
criteria (69.6% and 64.0% MYL-1401O and Herceptin respectively) were within the pre-defined equivalence 
margin [-15; +15] (5.5% with a 95% CI of -3.08%, 14.04%) based on central tumour evaluation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 124/128 
  
  
The results are considered robust, as the investigator assessments were in line with the main analysis. Various 
sensitivity  analyses  (subgroup  ORR  analyses  by  stratification  factor,  replication  of  analysis  in  ITT2  and  PP 
populations) confirmed the results of the primary analyses. 
Secondary endpoints TTP, PFS, OS and DR were assessed in the Part 1 and Part 2. Analyses of these endpoints 
in Part 2 (after 48 weeks of treatment in total) confirmed the similarity outcomes observed at the Week 24 
endpoint.  Tumour  progression  occurred  in  41.3%  and  43.0%  of  patients  treated  with  Ogivri  and  Herceptin, 
respectively  (p=0.684),  55.7%  and  55.3% did  not experience tumour  progression  or  death  (PFS,  p=0.842) 
whereas  89.1%  and  85.1%  survived  until  48  weeks  (OS,  p=0.439),  respectively.  Additionally,  42.4%  of 
MYL-1401O subjects compared to 44.5% of Herceptin subjects (p = 0.790) with objective response had tumour 
progression or died before the 48 week cut-off (DR). These findings were also confirmed through sensitivity 
analyses. 
Safety  and  immunogenicity  data  were  provided  from  the  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast 
cancer  and  healthy  volunteers.  Due  to  the  vast  experience  gained  from  the  reference  medicinal  product 
Herceptin, the safety profile is well known. Overall, treatment with MYL-1401O was well tolerated during 48 
weeks and no new or unexpected safety signals were observed (mostly in line with Herceptin safety profile + 
taxanes). 
In  MYL-Her-3001,  at  48  weeks,  the  safety  profiles  were  comparable  between  the  2  arms  (MYL-1401O  and 
Herceptin), with as similar number of patients with at least 1 grade 3 or higher TEAE, with serious TEAE, with 
TEAE leading to interruption of trastuzumab or to discontinuation of the study. 
The incidence of SAEs was similar in the treatment groups. The majority reported SAEs were in the SOC of Blood 
and lymphatic system disorders, and the most frequently reported PT overall was neutropenia. The majority of 
SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug. Nevertheless, more SAEs in the MYL-1401O arm than in the 
Herceptin arm were attributed by the investigators to the study drug. Most SAEs that began in Part 1 resolved 
or resolved with sequelae, except for those that were fatal. Two SUSARs were reported in Part 1.  
Through Week 48, 10 patients experienced fatal TEAEs, 6 in the MYL-1401O arm (2.4%, 8 events, 6 deaths 
during part 1 and 2 deaths during monotherapy: 1 dyspnea not related to study drug and 1 carditis unlikely 
related to drug) and 4 in the Herceptin arm (1.6%, 6 events during part 1). Most of the TEAE and SAE seen over 
48 weeks, were driven by data until Week 24 (part 1), and most likely attributable to the background taxane 
therapy. 
The immunogenicity of MYL-1401O and Herceptin was assessed during 48 weeks by measuring the ADA levels 
in blood samples. The incidence of antidrug antibodies against MYL-1401O and Herceptin was very low and 
consistent with literature. These antibodies were transient and the titers were low. Also, the incidence of 
neutralizing antibodies was very low and similar in both arms. Overall, the treatment-emergent immune 
response was similar between the 2 treatment arms. No association was observed between the presence of 
ADAs and efficacy (as measured by ORR), nor to ARRs. These results indicate that there was no clinically 
meaningful difference between MYL-1401O and Herceptin in terms of immunogenicity and that these data are 
consistent with the literature (low immunogenic potential of the innovator product). 
Overall, the treatment of MBC patients with MYL-1401O is well tolerated (in combination with taxanes and in 
monotherapy), with a low immunogenicity, and no new or unexpected safety signals were observed compared 
to Herceptin-EU. Therefore, although some slight differences have been reported between two arms, the long 
term (48 weeks) safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of MYL-1401O and Herceptin are overall comparable.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties regarding the comparability of Ogivri with Herceptin. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
The analytical biosimilarity of Ogivri to EU-approved Herceptin has been satisfactorily demonstrated.  
From a non-clinical perspective, biological function parameters such as HER 2 binding, inhibition of proliferation, 
ADCC, C1q binding and Fc receptor binding were found to be similar between MYL-1401O and Herceptin. In 
addition, the assays have been adequately qualified.  
With regards to clinical efficacy, similarity in terms of ORR at week 24 has been shown with the a priori defined 
equivalence margin (15%). The results are considered robust enough as different sensitivity analyses support 
the  main  analysis,  including  comparison  according  to  stratification  factors  and  analyses  in  the  ITT2  and  PP 
groups. The results of the primary analysis are further supported by secondary efficacy endpoints. Overall, the 
clinical efficacy data support biosimilarity. 
A comparable safety and immunogenicity profile has been shown between the biosimilar candidate MYL-1401O 
and the originator product, establishing biosimilarity (in combination with taxanes and in monotherapy). 
Biosimilarity is supported from a quality, non-clinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, as well as from a 
clinical efficacy and safety point of view.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Herceptin is authorised in the treatment of HER2-positive MBC, early breast cancer (EBC), and metastatic 
gastric cancer (MGC). The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications (i.e., to inhibit 
the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2). The target receptor involved in the mechanism 
of action in EBC and MGC is same as in MBC (i.e., HER2). Trastuzumab is indicated in EBC and MGC only if HER2 
positivity is demonstrated. The dosage is also similar for all the indications. Trastuzumab is administered by the 
same route in all indications.  
The available safety data of the reference product does not indicate that there are any significant differences in 
expected toxicities for each condition of use and patient population. There are no toxicities that are related to 
off-target activities in MBC compared with EBC or MGC. 
Research performed on the active substance of the reference product shows that it does not interact with several 
receptors that may have a different impact in the tested and non-tested therapeutic indications, and molecular 
typing has indicated that it does not have more than one active site other than the HER2 targeting area. 
Overall, results of the physico-chemical, structural, and biological characterisation studies together with the 
evidence from non-clinical and clinical studies support extrapolation to the other oncology indications. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
The applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications for the biosimilar as granted for Herceptin for 
intravenous administration in the EU. Considering Herceptin is also marketed for subcutaneous administration, 
adequate risk minimisation measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in 
the SmPC section 4.2.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Ogivri is considered biosimilar to Herceptin. Therefore, a benefit/risk 
balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Ogivri is favourable in the following indication: 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Ogivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC): 
- 
as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  received  at  least  two  chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments 
- 
- 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease 
In  combination  with  an  aromatase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  patients  with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Ogivri is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see SmPC 
section 5.1) 
following  adjuvant  chemotherapy  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide,  in  combination  with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in  combination  with  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  followed  by  adjuvant  Ogivri  therapy,  for  locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Ogivri should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have either HER2 
overexpression  or  HER2  gene  amplification  as  determined  by  an  accurate  and  validated  assay  (see  SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/810499/2018 
Page 127/128 
  
  
 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Ogivri in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have 
not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Ogivri  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with  metastatic  gastric  cancer  (MGC)  whose  tumours  have  HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. Accurate 
and validated assay methods should be used (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1).

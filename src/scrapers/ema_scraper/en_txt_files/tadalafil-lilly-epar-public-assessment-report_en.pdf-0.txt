SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
The  MAH  for  Cialis  provided  consent  to  make  use  of  the  pharmaceutical,  preclinical  and  clinical 
documentation contained in the file of Cialis, assessed and approved.  
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Tadalafil Lilly are identical to the up to date quality, 
safety and efficacy profile of Cialis. The application for Tadalafil Lilly concerns the strength of 20mg 
film-coated tablets and consists only of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Tadalafil Lilly medicinal product are identical to the 
up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Cialis.  
Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Cialis CHMP assessment reports and in 
the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The  Tadalafil  Lilly  informed  consent  application  concerns  only  the  20  mg  strength  of  Cialis.  The 
Summary of Product Characteristics for Tadalafil Lilly appropriately reflects this.  
The approved indication is:  
Treatment of erectile dysfunction. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.  
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women. 
Tadalafil is an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor that has been developed 
as  a  treatment  for  erectile  dysfunction.  When  sexual  stimulation  causes  the  local  release  of  nitric 
oxide, which plays a central role in the vasodilation of erectile tissues by stimulating guanylyl cyclase 
activity, consequently raising intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
and  relaxing  vascular  smooth  muscle. This results  in  smooth  muscle  relaxation  and  inflow  of  blood 
into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. 
Thus,  tadalafil  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction.  Tadalafil  has  no  effect  in  the 
absence of sexual stimulation. 
Tadalafil should not be used in individuals below 18 years of age. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Cialis application, the quality data in support of 
the Tadalafil Lilly application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Cialis dossier , which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).  
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Since Tadalafil Lilly application is an informed consent of the Cialis application, the non-clinical data 
in  support  of  the  Cialis  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Cialis 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

2.4 
Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Cialis application, the clinical data in support of 
the Tadalafil Lilly application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Cialis dossier, which 
have  been  assessed  and  approved  (including  all  post-marketing  procedures).  No  additional  clinical 
studies are provided. 
2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (version 2.2) as described by the applicant 
fulfils the legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan (version 3) identical with that for Cialis. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
PSUR 
The PSUR cycle of Tadalafil Lilly will correspond to the one of the cross-referred product, Cialis, 
until otherwise specified. Therefore, as of 15 December 2007, the MAH will continue to submit yearly 
PSURs unless otherwise specified by the CHMP. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Cialis application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit balance of Tadalafil Lilly was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the 
marketing authorisation for the following indication:  
“Treatment of erectile dysfunction. 
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. 
Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women.” 
•  User consultation 
A justification for not conducting a user testing for this application was provided, in view of the fact 
that  the  company  has  no  intention  to  market  this  product in  the current  indication.  However,  a  user 
consultation in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83 is requested during the 
upcoming  Type  II  variation  procedure  for  Tadalafil  Lilly  to  change  the  indication  to  PAH.  This  is 
included as a follow up measure.

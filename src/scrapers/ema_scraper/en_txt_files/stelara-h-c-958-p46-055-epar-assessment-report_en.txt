1.  Introduction 
On 8th September, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Stelara (ustekinumab) in 
subjects aged aged 2 to <18 with Moderately to Severely active Crohns Disease (CD), in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that binds both 
human interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 via a common IL-12/23p40 subunit. Ustekinumab neutralises the 
activities of IL-12 and IL-23 by preventing these cytokines from binding to the IL-12 receptor beta-1 
receptor protein, which is expressed on the surface of immune cells. 
Ustekinumab received a Marketing Authorisation in the EU in January 2009 for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, followed by the MAs for the treatment of adult 
patients with active PsA in September 2013, of paediatric patients (age ≥12 to <18 years) with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in June 2015, of adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s 
disease in November 2016, of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC in September 2019 
and of paediatric patients (age ≥6 to <12 years) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in January 
2020. 
Stelara (ustekinumab) Clinical Study CNTO1275CRD1001 (UniSTAR) was a Phase 1 study conducted 
primarily to evaluate the PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of ustekinumab in paediatric 
subjects aged 2 to <18 years with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease.  
This study is included in the agreed ustekinumab PIP for Crohns disease (EMEA-000311-PIP04- 13). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
The following formulations were used in the CNTO1275CRD1001 study:

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
A Randomised Double-blind Pharmacokinetic Study of Ustekinumab in Paediatric 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease 
Protocol No.: CNTO1275CRD1001 
Description 
Study CNTO1275CRD1001 (UniSTAR) was a Phase 1 study conducted primarily to evaluate the PK, 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of ustekinumab in paediatric subjects aged 2 to <18 years with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. The study consisted of a main study through Week 16 
followed by an LTE up to Week 268. Paediatric subjects from the main study who were receiving 
benefit from ustekinumab maintenance therapy, as determined by the investigator, (through Week 16) 
were eligible to enter the LTE (Figure 1). Results through Week 16 were already reported in the 
CNTO1275CRD1001 16-Week CSR. In the LTE, Last Patient Last Visit was 18 March 2022, and the final 
CNTO1275CRD1001 CSR has been completed (01 August 2022). 
Subjects were randomised at Week 0 in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups stratified by weight 
(<40 kg, ≥40 kg) and by previous TNFα antagonist exposure status (Yes, No). 
Subjects in each treatment group received a single IV administration of ustekinumab at Week 0. 
The induction dosage regimens were: 
•  Group 1: 3 mg/kg for subjects <40 kg or 130 mg for subjects ≥40 kg. 
•  Group 2: 9 mg/kg for subjects <40 kg or 390 mg for subjects ≥40 kg. 
Following their single IV induction dose at Week 0, all subjects received a SC maintenance dose of 
ustekinumab at Week 8 of: 
•  2 mg/kg for subjects <40 kg or 90 mg for subjects ≥40 kg. 
At Week 16, all subjects were eligible to enter the LTE and continued receiving maintenance doses of 
SC ustekinumab q8w at a dose of 2 mg/kg for subjects <40 kg or 90 mg for subjects ≥40 kg provided 
that the subject was receiving benefit from ustekinumab maintenance therapy through Week 268 as 
determined by the investigator. Subjects who had not received benefit at Week 16 as determined by 
the investigator completed the Week 16 visit requirements, did not receive additional SC dosing, and 
returned at Week 28 for a final safety assessment. Starting at Week 208, subjects who might benefit 
from continued treatment were eligible to enrol in CNTO1275ISD3001. 
Subjects were permitted to receive the following concomitant medications for Crohn’s disease in this 
study: oral 5-ASAs, the immunomodulators AZA, 6-MP, and MTX, oral corticosteroids, total parental or 
enteral nutrition, and/or antibiotics for the treatment of Crohn’s disease provided the subject was 
receiving a stable dose for a specified period prior to baseline (as defined in the inclusion criteria). 
Enrolled subjects were not to initiate or increase the dose of any of the following concomitant Crohn’s 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/12636/2023

disease-specific medical therapies including 5-ASAs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (ie, AZA, 6-
MP, or MTX), and/or total parental or enteral nutrition up to Week 16. Subjects who were receiving 
immunomodulators (ie, AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) or oral corticosteroids at baseline could discontinue them 
at any time during the study, and corticosteroids could be tapered beginning at Week 3. During the 
LTE, Crohn’s disease-specific therapies including 5-ASAs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (ie, 
AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and/or total parental or enteral nutrition were permitted to be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
The first DBL occurred after all subjects had either completed their Week 16 visit or terminated study 
participation prior to Week 16. The second DBL occurred at the end of the LTE. 
A diagram of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were to be 2 to <18 years old in the United States, 6 to <18 years old elsewhere, of 
either gender with a body weight of ≥10 kg. Subjects must have had a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or 
fistulising Crohn’s disease of at least 3 months with active colitis, ileitis or ileocolitis confirmed at any 
time in the past by radiography, histology, and/or endoscopy.  Subjects must have moderately to 
severely active Crohn’s disease defined as a baseline Paediatric Crohns Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) 
score of >30 and at least an abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) value (>0.3 mg/dL or 3.0 mg/L) at 
screening, or faecal calprotectin of >250 mg/kg or >250 μg/g at screening, or an ileocolonoscopy with 
evidence of active Crohn’s disease (defined as ulcerations in the ileum and/or colon) during 
screening/baseline visit. Subjects must have received prior or current medication for Crohn’s disease 
with at least one of the following therapies: oral corticosteroids, the immunomodulators azathioprine 
[AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX])., or currently have or have had a history of 
corticosteroid dependency (ie, an inability to successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of the 
symptoms of Crohn’s disease); or have a history of failure to respond to, or tolerate, at least 1 of the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/12636/2023  
Page 6/21 
 
 
 
 
 
following therapies: oral or IV corticosteroids, the immunomodulators AZA, 6-MP, or MTX; or required 
more than 3 courses of oral or IV corticosteroids in the past year. Subjects who have failed or are 
intolerant to anti-TNF therapy are eligible for participation but must meet at least one of the 
requirements for prior or current medication use for Crohn’s disease. 
Treatments 
Subjects in each treatment group received a single IV administration of ustekinumab at Week 0. 
Following their single IV induction dose at Week 0, all subjects received a SC maintenance dose of 
ustekinumab at Week 8. Subjects who had not received benefit at Week 16 as determined by the 
investigator completed the Week 16 visit requirements, including ileocolonoscopy, but did not receive 
additional SC dosing, and returned at Week 28 for a final safety assessment. 
Objectives 
Through Week 16 
The objectives of this study were to: 
1. Evaluate the PK of ustekinumab in subjects from 2 through <18 years old and determine if it is 
similar to that observed in adults with moderately to severely active Crohns disease. 
2. Assess the safety and immunogenicity of ustekinumab in this population. 
3. Assess the efficacy of ustekinumab in the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohns 
disease, including assessment of improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary focus of the study is to assess the PK of ustekinumab over time. Therefore, there is no 
primary efficacy endpoint, and no formal hypothesis testing was performed. 
Key Clinical Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Clinical response through Week 16 
•  Clinical remission through Week 16 
•  Baseline and postbaseline values and the change from baseline through Week 16 in PCDAI 
score 
•  Baseline and the change from baseline at Week 8 and at Week 16 in IMPACT-III score 
•  Crohn's disease-related hospitalizations or surgeries through Week 16 
•  Clinical remission and clinical response at Week 16 by baseline weight (<40 kg, ≥40 kg) 
This study also examined endpoints associated with CRP and faecal markers and endoscopic endpoints. 
From Week 16 through End of Study 
The objective of the LTE period of Study CNTO1275CRD1001 was to evaluate the PK, efficacy, safety 
and immunogenicity of ustekinumab in paediatric subjects 2 to <18 years old with moderately to 
severely active Crohn’s disease.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/12636/2023  
Page 7/21 
 
 
 
 
During the LTE, efficacy endpoints included clinical response and remission assessed with the PCDAI, 
corticosteroid-free clinical remission, height, weight, and BMI status, inflammatory markers (CRP, fecal 
calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin), and the IMPACT-III questionnaire (at Week 48). 
Sample size 
A sample size of 40 subjects was chosen empirically based on experience from previous PK studies of 
other biologics in paediatric subjects, including studies of golimumab in paediatric subjects with UC and 
paediatric subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Given the moderate variability associated with 
ustekinumab PK parameters in subjects with adult Crohns disease and assuming comparable PK 
variability between adults and paediatric subjects, a sample size of 40 was deemed sufficient to 
provide adequate PK data in paediatric subjects with Crohns disease. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Central randomisation was implemented in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 IV 
dose groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or 
under the supervision of the sponsor. Permuted block randomization with stratification variables of 
weight (<40 kg, ≥40 kg) and previous TNFα-antagonist exposure status (Yes, No) were used). 
Sponsor personnel remained blinded to induction treatment assignment until the Week 16 DBL. To 
maintain the study blind, a label on the study agent container containing the study name, study agent 
number, reference number, study agent identity, and dose was available only to unblinded study staff. 
However, if it was necessary for a subject's safety, the study blind could be broken by blinded staff and 
the dose of the study agent ascertained. 
Data that could potentially unblind the treatment assignment (ie, study agent serum concentrations, 
anti-ustekinumab antibodies, and treatment allocation) were to be handled with special care to ensure 
that the integrity of the blind was maintained and the potential for bias was minimised. 
Statistical Methods 
All randomised subjects who received at least 1 administration of ustekinumab were included in the 
efficacy and safety analyses. All enrolled subjects who received at least 1 administration of 
ustekinumab and who had one or more PK/immunogenicity blood samples obtained after the first 
ustekinumab dose were included in the PK and immunogenicity data sets.  
There will be no formal hypothesis testing performed. Rather, the PK of ustekinumab in paediatric 
subjects with moderately to severely active CD will be evaluated using descriptive statistics and 
population PK analyses, and assessed for similarities to the PK of ustekinumab in adult subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD.

Through Week 16 
A total of 44 subjects were randomized and treated with ustekinumab: 23 in the low dose group 
(ustekinumab 3 mg/kg IV or 130 mg IV), and 21 in the high dose group (ustekinumab 9 mg/kg IV or 
390 mg IV). A total of 4/44 (9.1%) subjects discontinued study agent through Week 16: 1 subject in 
the low dose group and 3 subjects in the high dose group. The most common reason for 
discontinuation of study agent was worsening Crohns disease. 
From Week 16 through Final Safety Follow-up Visit 
Of the 40 subjects who completed participation through Week 16, 34 subjects participated in the LTE: 
18 subjects from the low dose group and 16 subjects from the high dose group. In total, 26/34 
(76.5%) of the subjects remained on ustekinumab though the first year of treatment (ie, up to Week 
48; including the IV induction dose at Week 0, followed by SC maintenance doses starting at Week 8 
and continuing in the LTE). 
Over the course of the approximately 4 years of LTE, a total of 28/34 (82.4%) subjects discontinued 
study agent and 26/34 (76.5%) subjects terminated study participation from Week 16 through the 
final safety follow-up visit. The most frequently reported reasons for study agent discontinuation were 
lack of efficacy and an AE of worsening Crohn’s disease (these 2 reasons together accounted for 
14/34 [41.2%] subjects), withdrawal by the subject, and ‘other’ reasons. 
The reasons reported for termination of study participation were withdrawal by the subject and‘other
’ reasons, which included a switch to commercial STELARA (4 subjects), lack of efficacy, and Crohn’s 
disease-related events (such as surgery and worsening of the disease). None of the subjects 
terminated study participation because of COVID-19-related reasons. 
The disposition of subjects through Week 16 and through the study extension is presented in Figure 2 
and Figure 3, respectively.

Baseline data 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Through Week 16 
The baseline demographics were generally similar across both treatment groups except that there was 
a greater proportion of female subjects in the low dose group compared with the high dose group. The 
baseline demographics for the combined treatment groups are provided below. 
•  59.1% (26/44 subjects) were female. 
•  81.8% (36/44 subjects) were white. 
•  Median age of subjects was 13.0 years. 
22.7% (10/44 subjects) were between the ages of 6 to 11 years. 
77.3% (34/44 subjects) were between the ages of 12 to 17 years. 
•  Median body weight was 42.9 kg. 
40.9% (18/44 subjects) had a body weight <40 kg; 7 subjects were <30 kg including 1 subject with a 
body weight <20 kg 
59.1% (26/44 subjects) had a body weight ≥40 kg. 
Baseline disease characteristics were representative of a population of subjects with moderately to 
severely active Crohn’s disease and were similar across the treatment groups; however, baseline 
median CRP concentrations, baseline median fecal lactoferrin, median fecal calprotectin concentrations, 
and median SES-CD values were greater for subjects in the low dose group compared with subjects in 
the high dose group; thus the inflammatory burden was greater in the low dose group compared with 
the high dose group. 
Among treated subjects: 
• 
• 
The median duration of disease was 3.6 years. 
The median PCDAI score was 42.5. 
•  66.7% of subjects had severe disease (PCDAI score >40). 
• 
The median SES-CD score was 15.0. 
The proportions of subjects who had abnormal levels of inflammatory markers at baseline were as 
follows: 
•  CRP (>3 mg/L): 72.7% 
• 
• 
Faecal calprotectin (>250 mg/kg): 88.1% 
Faecal lactoferrin (>7.24 μg/mL): 97.7% 
Prior to study enrolment: 
•  88.6% (39 subjects) had used immunomodulators. 
•  63.6% (28 subjects) had used corticosteroids. 
•  90.9% (40 subjects) had used biologic therapy.

The proportions of subjects who were receiving each type of concomitant Crohn’s disease medication 
were generally similar across both treatment groups except that there was a greater proportion of 
subjects receiving immunomodulators in the high dose group compared with the low dose group. 
Among treated subjects: 
•  38.6% (17 subjects) were receiving immunomodulators. 
•  20.5% (9 subjects) were receiving oral aminosalicylates. 
•  31.8% (14 subjects) were receiving oral corticosteroids (including budesonide). 
From Week 16 through End of Study 
A summary of demographics at baseline for the study extension efficacy analysis set is provided below: 
•  61.8% (21/34 subjects) were female. 
•  85.3% (29/34 subjects) were white. 
•  Median (range) age of subjects was 13.0 (6.0; 17.0) years. 
23.5% (8/34 subjects) were between the ages of 6 to 11 years. 
76.5% (26/34 subjects) were between the ages of 12 to 17 years. 
•  Median (range) body weight was 41.05 (19.5; 70.1) kg. 
47.1% (16/34 subjects) had a body weight <40 kg, including 1 subject with a body weight <20 kg. 
52.9% (18/34 subjects) had a body weight ≥40 kg. 
•  Median (range) BMI was 17.23 (12.8; 25.1) kg/m2. 
The Crohns disease characteristics at baseline among treated subjects are summarized below: 
• 
• 
The median (range) duration of disease was 3.59 (0.7; 12.4) years. 
The median (range) PCDAI score was 42.50 (12.5; 60.0). 
59.4% (19/34 subjects) had severe disease (PCDAI score >40). 
By Week 16 (ie, the start of the LTE period of the study), the proportions of subjects receiving 
concomitant medications for Crohns disease had decreased to 7/34 (20.6%). The most frequently 
reported concomitant medications at the start of the LTE period were oral corticosteroids (including 
budesonide) and antibiotics. No subjects were taking immunomodulatory drugs at Week 16.

Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Results 
Through Week 16 
A summary of serum ustekinumab concentrations through Week 16 by induction treatment group in 
the overall paediatric CD population is presented in Table 1:

Table 1 Summary of Serum Ustekinumab Concentrations (micrograms/mL) 
Through Week 16; PK Analysis Set (Study CNTO1275CRD1001) 
•  After a single IV administration of the low dose (3 mg/kg or 130 mg) or the high dose (9 
mg/kg or 390 mg) of ustekinumab, mean and median serum ustekinumab concentrations were 
approximately dose-proportional at all sampling timepoints through Week 8. 
•  Median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 hour after the Week 0 IV induction dose 
were 50.51 μg/mL and 150.22 μg/mL for the low and high doses, respectively. At the end of

induction at Week 8, median serum ustekinumab concentrations were 1.18 μg/mL and 2.53μ
g/mL for the low and high doses, respectively. 
• 
Following SC administration of ustekinumab at Week 8, the impact of the difference in 
induction doses at Week 0 had diminished by Week 16. The median serum ustekinumab 
concentration at Week 16 was 1.04 μg/mL in the low dose group in comparison with 0.59μ
g/mL in the high dose group. 
The dose regimens evaluated in this study were designed to deliver comparable ustekinumab exposure 
in paediatric subjects with those observed in the corresponding reference adult CD population (ie, 
CNTO1275CRD3001, CNTO1275CRD3002, and CNTO1275CRD3003 studies). The following results 
compare ustekinumab concentrations over time between the overall paediatric population and 
paediatric body weight subgroups, with those in the corresponding adult reference population. 
A comparison of serum ustekinumab concentration between overall paediatric and adult subjects with 
Crohn’s disease is presented in Table 2.  Of note, the 130 mg and the ~6 mg/kg treatment groups in 
the adult study represents the adult reference groups for the low-induction (3 mg/kg or 130 mg) and 
high-induction (9 mg/kg or 390 mg) dose groups in the paediatric study, respectively.

•  Serum ustekinumab concentrations observed in the overall paediatric Crohns disease 
population were generally comparable to those observed in the reference adult CD population. 
However, a pattern towards lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations was observed in 
subjects in the <40 kg body weight subgroup compared with subjects in the ≥40 kg body 
weight subgroup and compared with the reference adult Crohn’s disease population.  Median 
serum ustekinumab concentrations in the ≥40 kg body weight subgroup were generally 
comparable with those in the reference adult population. 
•  Of 42 ustekinumab-treated subjects with appropriate samples, none was positive for antibodies 
to ustekinumab through Week 16. 
From Week 16 through End of Study 
After maintenance treatment with SC ustekinumab q8w starting at Week 8 and continuing in the LTE 
for up to 4 years, mean serum ustekinumab concentrations were generally consistent over time during 
the LTE period (Table 3). Most subjects had detectable drug levels through Week 200, but it should be 
noted that a small number of subjects remained in the study at this time.

Of the 34 subjects with appropriate samples who were treated with ustekinumab during the LTE 
period, 1/34 (2.9%) subject was positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through the final safety visit 
with a peak titre of 1:100. The subject was positive for NAb. 
Efficacy results 
This study had no formal hypothesis testing conducted and there was no placebo control group. 
The results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects, combined with the 
declining number of subjects over time. As the study was not designed to make any statistical 
comparisons, results are descriptive and are presented here for information purposes. 
Through Week 16 
Intravenous ustekinumab at Week 0 and an SC maintenance dose of ustekinumab at Week 8 induced 
improvements in clinical and endoscopic disease activity through Week 16 in paediatric subjects with 
Crohn’s disease across the efficacy outcome measures evaluated:

•  Numerically higher proportions of subjects in clinical response and clinical remission were seen 
in the high-induction dose group than in the low-induction dose group at earlier time points (ie 
Week 3 for clinical response; Week 3 and Week 6 for clinical remission). 
•  Reductions in the PCDAI score from baseline to Week 16 was observed in both the low 
induction dose group and high-induction dose group. Greater reductions were seen in the high-
induction dose group than in the low-induction dose group, at Week 3 
•  Reductions in objective biomarkers of inflammation (eg, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and fecal 
lactoferrin) were observed in both dose groups. 
• 
Improvement in the SES-CD score from baseline to Week 16 was observed in both the low 
induction dose group and high-induction dose group. 
•  Similar proportions of subjects in both dose groups had endoscopic response, endoscopic 
remission and clinically meaningful endoscopic improvement and endoscopic healing at Week 
16. 
• 
Improvement from baseline to Week 16 in the HRQOL measured by IMPACT III were observed 
in both the low-induction dose group and high-induction dose group. 
From Week 16 through End of Study 
Subcutaneous q8w maintenance doses of ustekinumab during the LTE period appeared to maintain the 
improvements in clinical and endoscopic disease activity observed up to Week 16.  Among the subjects 
who remained in the study: 
• 
The proportions of those in clinical response and clinical remission remained high throughout 
the LTE period. 
•  Reductions in the PCDAI score from baseline were maintained during the LTE period. 
• 
Improvements in height and weight z-scores were maintained during the LTE period. BMI z-
scores improved at Week 48 and improvements were maintained over time during the LTE 
period. 
•  Reductions from baseline in objective biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, fecal calprotectin, and 
fecal lactoferrin) were maintained during the LTE period. 
• 
Improvement from baseline in HRQOL, as measured by IMPACT-III, was maintained during the 
LTE period. 
•  No clear exposure-response relationship was evident between either improvement in PCDAI 
score, clinical response, or clinical remission, and serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 
48. 
Safety results 
Through Week 16 
Both single IV ustekinumab induction doses at Week 0 and the SC maintenance dose of ustekinumab 
at Week 8 were generally well tolerated through Week 16 in the paediatric CD population. 
•  2 subjects discontinued study agent due to an AE: 1 subject in each treatment group.  
Discontinuation of study agent due to AEs through Week 16 was generally attributed to 
unsatisfactory response to ustekinumab or worsening of Crohns disease.

•  Seven subjects (6 in the low dose group and 1 in the high dose group) reported SAEs through 
Week 16; the majority of which were associated with worsening of Crohn’s disease. 
•  No opportunistic infections including TB were reported through Week 16. 
•  No malignancies or deaths were reported through Week 16. 
•  There was 1 serious infection (intestinal abscess) reported in the low dose group. 
•  There were 17 infections (9 in the low group and 8 in the high dose group) reported through 
Week 16. 
•  One subject in the low dose group reported a transient AE of pyrexia during or within 1 hour of 
an infusion. 
•  No subjects reported injection-site reactions through the final safety visit. 
•  Haematology and chemistry laboratory values were generally within normal limits, infrequent 
abnormalities were not generally considered to be clinically important. 
•  The safety profile of ustekinumab was generally consistent across age and weight subgroups. 
From Week 16 through End of Study 
• 
• 
Through the final safety follow-up visit, 5/34 (14.7%) subjects discontinued study agent 
because of 1 or more AEs. Among the AEs resulting in study agent discontinuation the PT 
Crohns disease (worsening Crohn's disease) was most frequently reported. 
Through the final safety follow-up visit, 11/34 (32.4%) subjects reported 1 or more SAEs. The 
most frequently reported SAE was the PT Crohn's disease (worsening Crohn's disease). The 
remaining SAEs were singular events commonly related to Crohn’s disease (PTs Anal ulcer, 
Large intestinal stenosis, Malnutrition, Vomiting) or other singular events (PTs Constipation, 
Pancreatitis [due to AZA], Appendicitis). 
•  No malignancies or deaths were reported. 
•  No serious infections or opportunistic infections (including TB) were reported. Through the final 
safety follow-up visit, 28/34 (82.4%) of subjects reported 1 or more non-serious infections. 
Among the AEs of infection, the PTs Upper respiratory tract infection and Nasopharyngitis were 
most frequently reported. 
•  No injection-site reactions were reported. 
• 
• 
There were no reports of possible anaphylactic or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. 
The majority of the observed haematology or clinical chemistry laboratory parameter 
abnormalities were grade 1 in severity. No grade 4 abnormalities were observed. A grade 3 
abnormality (absolute lymphocytes decreased) was observed in 1/34 (2.9%) subject. Grade 2 
or higher abnormalities of decreased haemoglobin, decreased absolute neutrophils, and 
decreased absolute lymphocytes were observed through the final safety follow-up visit. Clinical 
chemistry parameter abnormalities of grade 2 were sporadic in nature. Few laboratory 
parameter abnormalities were reported as AEs, and all were singular events.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a completed paediatric study for Stelara (ustekinumab) in subjects aged aged 
2 to <18 with Moderately to Severely active CD, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
This was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind PK study of IV ustekinumab induction treatment 
followed by SC ustekinumab maintenance treatment in paediatric subjects with moderately to severely 
active Crohn’s disease.  Subjects were aged 2 to <18 years old in the United States, 6 to <18 years 
old elsewhere, with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohns disease (defined by a PCDAI 
score >30).  Subjects had to have an inadequate response and/or intolerance to biologic therapy 
and/or conventional therapies or be dependent upon corticosteroids. 
The purpose of study CNTO1275CRD1001 was to assess the PK of ustekinumab over time. There was 
no primary efficacy endpoint, and no formal hypothesis testing was performed. 
A total of 44 paediatric subjects were analysed; 23 in the low-induction dose group (ustekinumab 
3mg/kg IV or 130 mg IV), and 21 in the high-induction dose group (ustekinumab 9 mg/kg IV or 390 
mg IV).  
Overall 22.7% (10/44 subjects) were between the ages of 6 to 11 years and 77.3% (34/44 subjects) 
were between the ages of 12 to 17 years (median age was 13.0 years). Baseline demographic and 
disease characteristics were generally similar across the treatment groups. 
A total of 4 of the 44 subjects (9.1%) discontinued study agent through Week 16: 1 subject in the low-
induction dose group and 3 subjects in the high-induction dose group. The most common reason for 
discontinuation of study agent was worsening Crohns disease.  A total of 34 subjects entered the study 
extension at Week 16. 
Analysis of PK data through to Week 16 showed that:  
After a single IV administration of the low dose (3 mg/kg or 130 mg) or the high dose (9 mg/kg or 390 
mg) of ustekinumab, mean and median serum ustekinumab concentrations were approximately dose-
proportional at all sampling timepoints through Week 8. 
Median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 hour after the Week 0 IV induction dose were 50.51 
μg/mL and 150.22 μg/mL for the low and high doses, respectively. At the end of induction at Week 8, 
median serum ustekinumab concentrations were 1.18 μg/mL and 2.53 μg/mL for the low and high 
doses, respectively. 
Following SC administration of ustekinumab at Week 8, the impact of the difference in induction doses 
at Week 0 had diminished by Week 16. The median serum ustekinumab concentration at Week 16 was 
1.04 μg/mL in the low dose group in comparison with 0.59 μg/mL in the high dose group. 
Serum ustekinumab concentrations observed in the overall paediatric CD population were generally 
comparable to those observed in the reference adult CD population. However, a pattern towards lower 
median serum ustekinumab concentrations was observed in subjects in the <40 kg body weight 
subgroup compared with subjects in the ≥40 kg body weight subgroup and compared with the 
reference adult CD population. 
Median serum ustekinumab concentrations in the ≥40 kg body weight subgroup were generally 
comparable with those in the reference adult population.

Of the 34 subjects with appropriate samples who were treated with ustekinumab during the LTE 
period, 1/34 (2.9%) subject was positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through the final safety visit 
with a peak titre of 1:100. The subject was positive for NAb. 
Since results from this study suggested that the mg/kg dose adjustment strategy used did not 
consistently result in similar exposures in the lowest body weight subgroups this information was used 
to inform the design and dosing of the follow-up CNTO1275CRD3004 Phase 3 paediatric study.  That 
study subsequently implemented a BSA-based dose adjustment strategy for paediatric participants 
with lower body weight (<40 kg) to minimize the variability of ustekinumab exposure across the lower 
paediatric weight band.  The results from this study are seen as informing current and future 
ustekinumab paediatric studies. 
This study had no formal hypothesis testing.  However, measures of clinical response and clinical 
remission (including PCDAI scores, biomarkers of inflammation, SES-CD scores and other endoscopic 
measures) through Week 48 were suggestive of clinical improvements in disease activity. 
Safety results from this study suggest that the safety profile of ustekinumab in the paediatric CD 
population was generally consistent with the established safety profile of ustekinumab in the adult 
Crohns disease population.  No deaths were reported through the final safety visit. 
There are several limitations of this study; firstly, although this was a randomised study, there was no 
placebo control group, so no comparisons can be made between the ustekinumab group and a placebo 
group. Secondly, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects, 
combined with the declining number of subjects over time. As the study was not designed to make any 
statistical comparisons, results are descriptive and are limited in value in terms of clinical value.  
Despite these limitations the study does provide an understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile of 
ustekinumab in paediatric subjects and subsequently provided information to inform dose design for 
other ustekinumab paediatric CD studies.  The results also appear to suggest a benefit in terms of 
clinical efficacy for paediatric CD patients treated with ustekinumab. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In the context of this PAM for a completed paediatric study for Stelara (ustekinumab), in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, the MAH has met their obligations. 
Due to the design of the study no conclusions on safety and efficacy of ustekinumab in paediatric 
subjects could be made. 
Stelara, at this time, does not have an indication for treatment of paediatric patients with CD, no 
updates to PI are proposed. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
GRANUPAS 4 g gastro-resistant granules 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each sachet contains 4 g of para-aminosalicylic acid.  
For the full list of excipients, see section  6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Gastro-resistant granules 
The granules are small off white/ light brown coloured approximately 1.5 mm diameter. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
GRANUPAS is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for multi-drug 
resistant tuberculosis in adults and paediatric patients from 28 days of age and older when an effective 
treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
4 g (one sachet) three times per day. 
The recommended schedule is 4 g every 8 hours. GRANUPAS can be taken with food. 
Maximum daily dose is 12 g. Usual duration of treatment is 24 months. 
Desensitization 
Desensitization can be accomplished by starting with 10  mg para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) given as 
a  single dose.  The  dosage  is  doubled  every  2 days  until  reaching a  total  of  1 gram after  which  the 
dosage  is divided  to  follow  the  regular  schedule  of  administration.  If  a  mild  temperature  rise  or 
skin  reaction develops, the increment is to be dropped back one level or the progression held for one 
cycle. Reactions are rare after a total dosage of 1.5 g. 
Paediatric population 
The optimal dose regimen in children is uncertain. Limited pharmacokinetic data suggest  no 
substantial difference between adults and  children. 
For infants, children and adolescents the dosage will be adapted to the patient’s weight at 150 mg/kg 
per  day,  divided  in  two  intakes.  A  dosing  spoon  is  provided  to  measure  small  doses  below  4 g 
for young children. 
The safety and efficacy of para-aminosalicylic acid in neonates have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration

Oral use. 
The  contents  of  the  sachet  should  be  added  to  a  glass  of  orange  or  tomato  juice.  They  will  not 
dissolve, but swirling the juice in the glass will help re-suspend the granules if they sink. It should be 
drunk at once ensuring that the granules are not left in the glass. Any granules left-over at the bottom 
of the glass should be swallowed immediately by adding a small quantity of liquid. Smaller doses in 
children should be measured using the dosing spoon and given by sprinkling on apple sauce or yogurt. 
The medicinal product should be swallowed immediately after mixing with orange juice, tomato  juice, 
apple sauce and yogurt whilst the granules are intact. 
The granules should not be crushed or chewed, as this impairs the gastro-resistant coating. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe renal disease. Patients with severe renal impairment should not receive para-aminosalicylic 
acid. Patients with severe renal disease will accumulate the inactive acetyl metabolite of para-
aminosalicylic acid. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Mild to moderate renal impairment 
Given that  the  metabolites  of  para-aminosalicylic  acid are largely excreted via glomerular filtration, 
caution is warranted in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see also section  4.3). 
Gastric ulcer 
Para-aminosalicylic acid should be used with caution in patients with peptic ulcer. 
Hepatic impairment 
Para-aminosalicylic acid should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Hepatic toxicity 
Para-aminosalicylic acid may cause hepatitis. The first symptoms usually appear within three  months 
of the start of therapy with a rash as the most common adverse reaction followed by fever and much 
less frequently by gastrointestinal disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhoea. Treatment should be 
stopped immediately in this case. 
Hypersensitivity 
The patient must be monitored carefully during the first three months of therapy and treatment must 
be discontinued immediately at the first sign of a rash, fever or other premonitory signs of intolerance. 
See section 4.2 for posology adjustments for desensitization. 
Hypothyroidism in HIV co-infected patients 
Para-aminosalicylic acid may be associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism in HIV co-
infected patients. Thyroid function should be monitored in HIV co-infected patients before 
commencing treatment and regularly during treatment, in particular when para-aminosalicylic acid is 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
co-administered with ethionamide/prothionamide. 
Patients should be advised that the skeletons of the granules may be seen in the  stools. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
Results from literature suggest the following: 
Vitamin B12 
Vitamin B12 absorption may be reduced by para-aminosalicylic acid with clinically significant 
erythrocyte abnormalities developing after depletion; patients on therapy of more than one month 
should be considered for maintenance of vitamin B12. 
Digoxin 
Para-aminosalicylic acid may decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin, by inhibiting the 
absorption function of intestinal cells. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored in patients on 
concomitant therapy. 
Ethionamide 
Co-administration of para- aminosalicylic acid and ethionamide may intensify adverse reactions of 
para-aminosalicylic acid, mainly the gastrointestinal effects, including jaundice, hepatitis, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain or anorexia. Ethionamide should be withdrawn if these effects are 
significant. 
Diphenylhydramine 
This medicinal product decreases the gastrointestinal absorption of para-aminosalicylic acid, and 
should not be administered concomitantly. 
Antiretrovirals 
In a drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects with para-aminosalicylic acid calcium (PAS-Ca) 
formulation, the exposure of tenofovir decreased approximately 3-fold when co-administered with 
multiple doses of 4000 mg PAS-Ca compared with administration of tenofovir alone. The mechanism 
behind this interaction is unknown. No clinical interaction data is available to determine the relevance 
of this interaction to the current PAS formulation, but attention should be paid to the potential risk for 
decreased efficacy of tenofovir when co-administered with para-amino salicylic acid. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of para-aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
GRANUPAS is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Literature reports on para- aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women always report co-administration of 
other medicinal products. As there are no adequate and well controlled studies of para- aminosalicylic 
acid in humans, para-aminosalicylic acid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Breast-feeding 
Para-aminosalicylic acid is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of 
para-aminosalicylic acid in newborns/infants.. 
GRANUPAS should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There is no evidence available on the effect of para-aminosalicylic acid on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Para-aminosalicylic acid has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Most frequent adverse reactions were related to the gastrointestinal system. Cutaneous 
hypersensitivity reactions were also frequent as well as adverse reactions related to the  nervous 
system.

Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism in HIV co-infected patients is a very common event and occurs in ≥ 1/10 subjects, 
particularly when para-aminosalicylic acid is administered with ethionamide/prothionamide. 
Malabsorption syndrome 
A malabsorption syndrome can develop in patients on para-aminosalicylic acid, but is usually not 
complete. The complete syndrome includes steatorrhoea, an abnormal small bowel pattern on x-ray, 
villus atrophy, depressed cholesterol, reduced D-xylose and iron absorption. Triglyceride absorption 
is always normal. 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in 
adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting  system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose in humans.  In the event of overdose, it is recommended that 
the patient is monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and that appropriate 
symptomatic treatment is instituted immediately.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: 
J04AA01 
Mechanism of action 
Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It inhibits the onset of 
bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid. 
The mechanism of action of para-aminosalicylic acid resembles the sulfonamides, competing with 
paraminobenzoic acid (PABA) for dihydropteroate synthetase (DHP), a key enzyme in the 
biosynthesis of folates. However, para-aminosalicylic acid appears to be a weak inhibitor of DHP in 
vitro, raising the possibility that it may have a different target.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
GRANUPAS is a gastro-resistant preparation and, therefore, the acid-resistant coating of the granules 
protects against degradation in the stomach therefore preventing the formation of meta-aminophenol (a 
known hepatotoxin). The small granules are designed to escape the restriction on gastric emptying of 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
large particles. Under neutral conditions as are found in the small intestine or in neutral foods, the 
acid-resistant coating is dissolved within one minute. 
Care must be taken in the administration of these granules to protect the acid-resistant coating by 
maintaining the granules in an acidic food during dosage administration. 
Because the granules are protected by an enteric coating, absorption does not commence until they 
leave the stomach. The soft skeletons of the granules remain and may be seen in the stools. 
In a single dose (4 grams) pharmacokinetic study in healthy adult volunteers (N=11) the initial time to 
a 2 µg/mL serum level of aminosalicylic acid was 2 hours with a range of 45 minutes to 24 hours; the 
median time to peak was 6 hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours; the mean peak level was 20 µg/mL 
with a range of 9 to 35µg/mL: a level of 2 µg/mL was maintained for an average of 8 hours with a 
range of 5 to 9.5 a level of 1 µg/mL was maintained for an average of 8.8 hours with a range of 
6 to 11.5 hours. 
Distribution 
Para-aminosalicylic acid is distributed in various tissues and fluids including the lungs, kidneys, liver 
and peritoneal fluid. Pleural or synovial fluid concentrations are approximately equal to plasma. The 
drug does not cross the blood brain barrier in patients unless the meninges are inflamed, when the 
concentration of para-aminosalicylic acid in cerebrospinal fluid is about 10 to 50% of the plasma. It is 
unknown whether it passes through the placental barrier. Small amounts of this agent are distributed in 
the milk and bile. 
Plasma protein binding is about 50 to 60%, the kinetic distribution has a half-life of 0.94 hours and a 
volume of distribution of 1.001 L/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Para-aminosalicylic acid is acetylated in the liver and converted into the inactive metabolite, N-acetyl-
para-aminosalicylic acid which is devoid of bacteriostatic activity. The plasma half-life of this agent is 
about 1 hour, the concentration is not substantially altered in hepatic dysfunction. The concentration of 
the metabolite may be increased in cases of renal failure. 
The major metabolites of PAS are produced by conjugation to glycine in para-aminosalicyluric acid 
(PASU) for up to 25% of the dose and to N-acetyl in N-acetyl para-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-PAS) for 
up to 70% of the dose. Together they constitute more than 90% of the total metabolites of PAS found 
in urine. 
Elimination 
In a single dose study the plasma half-life of para-aminosalicylic acid administered as GRANUPAS 
was 1.62 ± 0.85 h. 
Para-aminosalicylic acid and its metabolites are excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. 
The cumulative excretion of para-aminosalicylic after 24 hours is 84% of an oral dose of 4 g, 21% as 
para-aminosalicylic acid and 63% as the acetylated form. The acetylation process is not genetically 
determined as is the case for isoniazid. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. 
The data available from a rat embryofoetal development study, where animals were given sodium 
aminosalicylate (3.85 to 385 mg/kg) were limited. Bone defects were observed at 77 mg/kg only.and 
increased foetal weight was noted at the other doses. Other malformations were observed; however, 
the exact nature of these findings is unknown. The lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that 
the findings are not of clinical relevance, but it is noted that the findings were observed at doses below 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
those proposed clinically. In the rabbit, sodium aminosalicylate had no effects on embryofoetal 
development; however, the doses evaluated were below those proposed clinically. 
Sodium aminosalicylic acid was not mutagenic in Ames test strain TA 100. In human lymphocyte 
cultures in-vitro clastogenic effects of achromatic, chromatid, isochromatic breaks or chromatid 
translocations were not seen at 153 or 600 µg /mL but at 1500 and 3000 µg /mL there was a dose 
related increase in chromatid aberrations. An in vivo genotoxicity study (micronucleus test) has been 
conducted with para-aminosalicylic acid. Results indicate that para-aminosalicylic acid was considered 
not to have produced any clastogenic effect in mice treated at non-toxic dose levels (examined 
24 hours after 2 daily administrations of 312.5 to 1250 mg/kg).

1.  Introduction 
On 21st of June 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study C4591014 (Kaiser) for 
BNT162b2, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that C4591014 (Kaiser) is a stand-alone study.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
BNT162b2 is a modified RNA vaccine that encodes the full-length, membrane-anchored S glycoprotein 
of SARS-CoV-2 with two introduced proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation. The 
formulation (doses and primary vaccination schedule) differs for the various age groups in the study, 
the recommendations according to the SmPC at the time of the study were employed.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for:

C4591014 (Kaiser) 
Description 
A retrospective database study using Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) electronic health 
records to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 in a real-world setting.   
The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 >7 days after the 
second dose against hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection 
using a test-negative design (TND). Stratification by age group was requested in alignment with the 
rolling authorisations. TND studies are considered a robust type of observational study for evaluating 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infectious respiratory diseases. The TND is a case-control study 
where all included subjects are required to be tested for the disease of interest. Previous exposures 
(e.g., vaccines) are compared between disease-positive “cases” and disease- negative “controls” to 
evaluate whether the exposures are associated with disease-negative status (i.e., protective). 
Individuals are enrolled from a group of subjects presenting for medical care with a common clinical 
presentation (e.g., ARI) to ensure that cases and controls are enrolled from the same source 
population. As a result, the main advantages of the TND are that it helps to avoid bias due to

(unmeasured) healthcare-seeking behaviour, including the propensity to test for infection, and its ease 
of access to controls that are representative of the source population. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Individuals met the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study: 
1. 
KPSC Individuals eligible to receive BNT162b2 who were admitted to the hospital (primary 
objective and some secondary objectives) with acute respiratory infection after 14 December 
2020 (date of first vaccinations at KPSC), and who received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 
2. 
For secondary objectives estimating VE against ED admission, the TND included KPSC 
individuals eligible to receive BNT162b2 who presented to the ED with ARI without a 
subsequent hospitalisation within 14 days after 14 December 2020, and who received a PCR 
test for SARS-CoV-2. 
3.  We included membership requirement of 1 year prior to index date (except in the >6 month to 
4 years old cohort, where individuals <1 year old did not have the 1-year membership 
requirement), which was defined as the date of hospitalisation or ED admission (allowing 31-
day administrative gap), to facilitate accurate capture of comorbid conditions. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1. 
Individuals who received only another newly licensed or investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or 
COVID-19 prophylactic agent other than COVID-19 vaccine prior to hospitalisation (or ED, for 
secondary objective). 
2. 
If index date was within 7 days of 2nd dose or within 14 days of all other dosing regimens from 
vaccination date. 
Setting 
Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is a large integrated healthcare delivery system that 
covers more than 4.7 million members in Southern California (United States). 
Treatments 
In this non-interventional retrospective study, the study participants had received either zero, one, two 
or three doses of BNT162b2. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2 doses of BNT162b2 
vaccine against ARI requiring hospitalisation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection among KPSC members 
eligible for vaccination. VE was evaluated using a TND, including all KPSC individuals eligible for 
vaccination who were admitted to the hospital with an ARI after 14 December 2020 (date of first 
vaccinations at KPSC), and who received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.  
Secondary and exploratory objectives were designed a priori to examine VE by the number of doses, 
as well as against ED admission, specific variants, durability, age cutoffs to align with regulatory

Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were undertaken as data were retrieved from a retrospective 
database. The TND analysis was event-driven based on the number of cases identified. Study sample 
size was based on the primary endpoint (BNT162b2 VE against ARI requiring hospitalisation where 
SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the TND study). The required sample size was dependent on i) the 
proportion of all-cause ARI requiring hospitalisation caused by SARS-CoV-2 (which determined the 
number of cases identified and the ratio of cases to controls in the primary analysis), ii) the average 
uptake of BNT162b2 in the study population over the duration of the study, and iii) the assumed VE of 
the specific COVID-19 vaccine against ARI requiring hospitalisation where SARS-CoV-2 was identified. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not relevant for the retrospective study in question. 
Statistical Methods 
Test Negative Design Analyses 
The analyses below were done separately for the primary population of hospitalised individuals as well 
as the secondary population of individuals with ED encounters. Further, they were stratified by age 
groups of interest in alignment with FDA authorisations and approvals over time. Individuals were 
included in the analyses regardless of prior COVID-19 infection status. 
Descriptive Analyses 
The proportion of hospitalised and ED individuals with ARI where SARS-CoV-2 was identified, as well as 
the proportion of individuals who received 0, 1, 2, and >2 doses of BNT162b2 were reported. We 
provided the average and median time between receipt of the first and second dose of BNT162b2 
among individuals who received 2 doses, between receipt of the first to second and second to third 
dose of BNT162b2 among individuals who received 3 doses, as well as between 14 December 2020 
(beginning of vaccinations at KPSC) and receipt of last dose of BNT162b2. Finally, we described age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, clinical characteristics, and severity (ICU admission, ventilator, death) by 
vaccination status, variant and among those PCR + for SARS-CoV-2. 
Estimated Crude (Unadjusted) VE 
Odds of having received BNT162b2 for cases and test-negative controls were constructed and 
compared using ORs and 95% CIs. VE was calculated as 1−OR multiplied by 100. Corresponding 95% 
CIs were calculated using the Wald method. Any VE estimates that resulted in a 95% confidence 
interval width greater than 50 percentage points were deemed imprecise and should be interpreted 
with caution. These results were included in tables and figures for completeness, but removed from the 
interpretation of results, similar to other COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness studies. 
Estimating Adjusted VE 
In addition to constructing crude VE estimates, logistic regression modelling to assess BNT162b2 VE 
after adjustment for potentially confounding factors was performed. Findings from the Phase 3 studies, 
expert opinion, and published studies of clinical/biologic factors were used to identify covariates for 
inclusion in the model. These were assessed for their availability and ability for adjusting crude results, 
including an examination of their distributions and missingness. Bivariate associations of potential 
confounders with the outcome, exposure, and each other were examined. For those with suggestions 
of imbalance with either exposure or outcome, the association between exposure and outcome was 
stratified by categories of the potential confounder to look for differences across strata (potential effect

modification) and influence on summary estimates of association (confounding). The variables were 
ultimately selected based on a combination of the a priori decisions and a qualitative assessment of the 
empirical relationships. The results of the multivariable model corroborated the knowledge gained from 
the stratified analyses. A 2-sided alpha of 0.05 was used for logistic regression modelling. 
Corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the Wald method. Similar to other COVID-VE reports 
throughout the pandemic, VE estimates that resulted in a 95% confidence interval width greater than 
50 percentage points were considered imprecise. As a result these estimates were not included in the 
interpretation of the results.44,45 A GEE estimator was used with a robust sandwich variance 
estimator to account for clustering introduced by variables measured at the neighbourhood level. 
Variables 
Outcomes and Exposures 
Cases: Cases were defined as those with any positive KPSC laboratory-confirmed PCR test from a 
sample collected within 14 days prior to hospital admission through 3 days after a hospital admission 
(primary objective and some secondary) or ED encounter (secondary objectives) with an ARI code. 
Controls: Controls were defined as those with laboratory confirmed negative COVID-19 (negative 
COVID-19 test collected within 14 days prior to hospital admission through 3 days after a hospital 
admission for (primary objective and some secondary) or ED encounter for secondary objectives with 
an ARI code and no positive COVID-19 tests within 14 days prior to encounter. 
Exposure Definition: The exposure of interest was history of vaccination with BNT162b2. For the 
primary objective, individuals were considered vaccinated if they have documented evidence of 
receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 ≥7 days before index date (i.e., date of hospitalisation or ED 
admission). Five levels of exposure variables were assessed: 
1.  Initial 2-dose vaccination series defined as 2 doses of BNT162b2 received with ≥7 days 
between receipt of the 2nd dose and the index date. This group served as the “exposed” group 
evaluated in the primary objective. Individuals who received only 1 dose or 2 doses of 
BNT162b2 with <7 days between receipt of the 2nd dose and the index date were excluded 
from analysis. 
2.  Partially vaccinated defined as 1 dose (only) of BNT162b2 received with ≥14 days between 
receipt of the 1st dose and the index date. This group served as the “exposed” group for a 
secondary endpoint. Individuals who received 2 doses or 1 dose of BNT162b2 with <14 days 
between receipt of the 1st dose and the index date were excluded from analysis. 
3.  Ever vaccinated defined as ≥1 dose of BNT162b2 received with ≥14 days between index date 
and receipt of the 1st dose. Individuals who received 1 dose of BNT162b2 received with <14 
days between receipt of the 1st dose and the index date were excluded from analysis. 
4.  Greater than 2 doses defined as receiving >2 doses of BNT162b2 with ≥14 days between 
receipt of the last dose and the index date. 
5.  Unvaccinated defined as never received BNT162b2 as of index date. This group served as the 
reference exposure group (i.e., ‘unexposed’ group) in most VE analyses. 
The 2-dose exposure group was considered for the primary objective, while the partially (1 dose), ever 
vaccinated (≥1 dose) and additional (>2 doses) groups were considered in secondary objectives.

To obtain information about vaccination that occurs outside of the KPSC healthcare system, KPSC 
established a partnership with 7 national pharmacy chains as well as the data exchange with the 
California Immunization Registry (CAIR). This partnership allows KPSC members to receive influenza 
and other vaccines outside of KPSC pharmacies. Starting 30 December 2020, a bidirectional data 
exchange was established with CAIR, thereby allowing capture of vaccinations received outside of 
KPSC. CAIR bidirectionality brings together a partnership between electronic medical records, the 
public health department, and pharmacies. Doses administered outside of KPSC were recorded in the 
electronic health record as, for example, “Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer, external administration.” 
In California, COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report COVID-19 doses administered 
within 24 hours of administration to their local immunisation registry. 
Covariates 
Individual-level and neighbourhood-level factors were considered for analysis. These are factors that 
either were identified as important covariates in previous work, have been identified in other risk factor 
literature, or were variables that might be associated with the exposure as well as outcome (i.e., prior 
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, etc). We also included calendar time as a covariate in our models to 
adjust for phase in vaccine rollout, testing practice changes, social distancing impacts, surges, and 
potential changes in clinical treatments. 
Table 2: Factors to be considered in models 
The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a validated measure of 1-year mortality risk. The CCI sums 
17 comorbidities which are weighted from 1 to 6, with 6 representing the most severe morbidity based 
on ICD-10 codes and age.

Among individuals <18 years the Sun Paediatric Comorbidity Index is used as a validated summary 
measure of disease burden. The index sums paediatric specific conditions which are each assigned 
weights ranging from 1 to 5. 
The Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (NDI) is a validated scale to assess 20 socioeconomic 
neighbourhood factors that are indicators of community health outcomes. The index includes 7 
domains: poverty, occupation, housing, employment, education, racial composition, and residential 
stability. A higher NDI score indicates increased health risk for the area.

Patient characteristics and outcomes of individuals 12-17 years of age hospitalised with an 
ARI 10 May 2021 - 31 August 2022 with a SARS-COV-2 test result: TND analysis 
Between 10 May 2021 to 31 August 2022, there were 393 KPSC individuals 12-17 years of age with an 
ARI hospitalisation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR test included in the analysis. The mean age was 14.8 years 
(standard deviation (SD) 1.64) and median was 15 years. About half (52.2%) were Hispanic and a 
quarter (25.2%) White. Individuals who were a normal or healthy weight (up to 85th percentile) had a 
higher proportion of vaccination (68.4%) than unvaccinated (31.6%). Fifty-four percent (53.9%) of 
individuals were male. The most common comorbidity was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(23.7%) and 14% were immunocompromised. The majority (61.1%) of individuals had a Charlson 
Comorbidity Index of zero. Almost all individuals had received a pneumococcal vaccine (95.2%) and 
50.6% had received a flu vaccine in the past 12 months.  
Forty-eight percent (48.3%) of individuals were unvaccinated, 2.8% had received 1 dose of BNT162b2, 
37.9% had received 2 doses, and 10.9% had received 3 doses. Race/ethnicity, body mass index, and 
clinical outcomes were generally similar among the unvaccinated and individuals vaccinated with 1, 2, 
or 3 doses. Individuals who received 3 doses had a higher proportion of hypertension (14.0%, p-value 
0.0044) and were immunocompromised (20.9%, p-value 0.5295). The proportion of unvaccinated 
individuals receiving a flu shot in the past 12 months was 32.1% and among vaccinated individuals, flu 
shots in the group based on the number of BNT162b2 were 1 dose: 63.6%; 2 doses: 66.4%; 3 doses: 
74.4%. 
Among 149 individuals (37.9%) individuals with 2 doses of BNT162b2, the mean age was 14.9 years 
(SD 1.60) and median was 15 years. Forty-four (44.3%) were Hispanic and a 28.2% White. Fifty-four 
percent (54.4%) of individuals were male. The most common comorbidity was chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (24.2%) and 13.4% were immunocompromised. The majority (60.4%) of 
individuals had a CCI of zero. Almost all individuals had received a pneumococcal vaccine (95.3%) and 
66.4% had received a flu vaccine in the past 12 months.

Patient characteristics and outcomes among individuals 5-11 years of age with an 
emergency department or urgent care visit due to an ARI 29 October 2021 –31 August 2022 
with a SARS-o-2 test result: TND Analysis 
There were only 355 children aged 5-11 years of age with a hospital admission between 29 October 
2021 to 31 August 2022. Among these hospitalisations, there were 71 who were SARS-CoV-2 positive 
and 275 that were SARS-COV-2 negative. There were 53 children hospitalised with ARI and tested 
positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were unvaccinated and 14 who had received two doses. Due to the small 
sample size and number of events, VE for hospitalisation could not be calculated. As an alternative, VE 
estimates against emergency department and urgent care were calculated for the monovalent vaccine. 
There were 4,606 children 5-11 years of age between 29 October 2021 to 31 August 2022 with an ED 
or UC visit due to an ARI diagnosis with a SARS-CoV-2 test who were included in the analysis dataset. 
The mean age was 7.6 years (SD 2.03), and median age was 7 years. About fifty-four percent (53.5%) 
of the individuals were male. Over half (56.7%) were Hispanic and 17.5% were White. Over half 
(55.4%) had a normal or healthy weight. 
About half of the individuals had a Sun Paediatric Comorbidity Index of 0 (52.1%) and 25.7% had an 
index of 1. Approximately twelve percent (12.4%) had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. A 
little over half of the encounters were in urgent care (56.5%, 2,601). 
The majority of individuals were unvaccinated (74.1%), 4.3% had received 1 dose, 20.5% had 
received 2 doses of BNT162b2, and 1.1% had received 3 doses. 
Among the 944 (20.5%) children who had received 2 doses of BNT162b2, the mean age was 8.0 years 
(SD 1.99) and median age was 8 years. Fifty-four percent (53.9%) of the individuals were male. About 
half (49.7%) were Hispanic and 17.5% were White. Over half (57%) had a normal or healthy weight. 
Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of the individuals had a Sun Paediatric Comorbidity Index of 0 and 26.8% 
had an index of 1. Twelve percent (12%) had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Over half of 
the encounters were in urgent care (59.3%, 560). 
Half of the individuals had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (50%), while 3.4% had an infection during the 
Delta period and 46.6% had an infection during the Omicron period. There were a higher proportion of 
negative controls who had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test (16.8%) compared with individuals 
during pre-Delta (0%), Delta (n<6), or Omicron (8.3%) (p-value <0.0001).

Patient characteristics and outcomes among individuals ≥6 months-4 years of age with an 
emergency department, urgent care or outpatient visit due to an ARI 23 July 2022 – 7 April 
2023 with a SARS-COV-2 test result: TND Analysis 
There were 1273 children ≥6 months to 4 years that had an ARI hospitalisation and 1191 were tested 
for SARS-CoV-2. Only 82 children were positive for SARS-CoV-2, of which 78 were unvaccinated. Due 
to the timing of the FDA authorisation in this age group, the sample size and number of 
hospitalisations were too low to calculate a VE against hospitalisation, despite extending the time 
period to 7 April 2023. As an alternative, VE against ED, UC and OP visits was calculated for this age 
group. There were 24,729 individuals ≥6 months-4 years with an ED, UC or OP due to ARI with a 
SARS-CoV-2 test between 23 July 2022 to 7 April 2023. The mean age was 2.0 (SD 1.4) and median 
age was 2.0 years. Over half (54%) of the individuals were male. Over half (55.7%) were Hispanic and 
19.7% were White. The majority of individuals had a Sun Paediatric Comorbidity Index of 0 (45.2%) or 
1 (23.3%). About nineteen percent (18.7%) of individuals had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test. A

little under half of the individuals were seen in the emergency department (46.8%), 29.5% in urgent 
care and 23.7% at an outpatient visit. The majority of individuals were unvaccinated (92.1%), 1.6% 
had received 1 dose of BNT162b2, 3.8% had received 2 doses, and 2.6% had received 3 doses (which 
is the recommended primary series for this age group). 
Among 634 (2.6%) individuals ≥6 months-4 years who received 3 doses of BNT162b2, the mean age 
was 2.4 (SD 1.17) and median age was 2 years. Over half (54.6%) of the individuals were male. 
Thirty-nine (38.6%) were Hispanic and 29.5% were White. The majority of individuals had a Sun 
Paediatric Comorbidity Index of 0 (45.9%) or 1 (24.6%). Nineteen percent (19.1%,) of individuals had 
a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and thirty-three percent (33.4%) were seen in the emergency 
department. 
The majority (90.0%) of individuals had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Race and ethnicity and the Sun 
Paediatric Comorbidity Index were similar between individuals with negative and positive tests. 
Individuals who had a negative test during the study period had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test 
19.8% of the time and those individuals who had a positive test had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 
test 8.4% of the time. 
Due to the time period of eligibility for vaccination, Omicron was the only predominant variant.

BNT162b2 effectiveness results 
Adolescents 12-17 years of age 
There were a limited number of acute respiratory infection hospitalisations (N = 393) among PCR 
tested individuals 12-17 years of age between 10 May 2020 – 31 August 2022: Unvaccinated 190, 1 
dose 11, 2 dose 149 and 3 dose 43. As a result, there was limited ability to calculate reliable VE 
estimates. The overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against hospitalisation 
due to SARS-CoV-2 among individuals 12-17 years of age who were diagnosed with an acute 
respiratory infection was 55% (95% CI: 23-74). 
During the Delta period, adjusted BNT162b2 effectiveness against hospitalisation due to SARS-CoV-2 
was 92% (95% CI: 71-98) for two doses and due to timing of the recommendation for a booster and 
the change in circulating variant, a 3-dose estimate could not be calculated. An Omicron estimate was 
deemed imprecise due to small sample size.

Negative Design 
Children 5-11 years of age 
The number of hospitalisations among individuals 5-11 years of age was extremely small (N=346) and 
VE could not be calculated against hospitalisation. There were 71 individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 
positive result of which 53 individuals were unvaccinated and 14 had received two doses of BNT162b2. 
As an alternative to calculating VE against hospitalisation, BNT162b2 effectiveness against ARI-
associated ED or UC visits from 29 October 2021 to 31 August 2022 was calculated among individuals 
5-11 years of age. 
The Omicron variant rapidly overtook the Delta variant as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in the US in 
December 2021, only two months after the BNT162b2 vaccine was authorised for use in individuals 5-
11 years of age. As a result, BNT162b2 VE against Delta could not be calculated and the overall 
estimate for this age group was limited to the Omicron circulating variant. The adjusted BNT162b2 
effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ARI-associated ED or UC visits due to SARS-CoV-2 
among individuals 5-11 years of age was 44% (95% CI: 34-53) and of 3 doses was 77% (95% CI: 55-
88). The effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 was 56% (95% CI: 45-65) at less than 3 months but 
fell to 32% (95% CI: 15-45) after 3 months since vaccination. VE was restored with a booster dose 
75% (95% CI: 52-87) within 3 months since vaccination.

Children ≥6 months to 4 years of age 
Similar to the other paediatric age groups, there were limited ARI hospitalisations (N = 1273) who 
were tested for SARS-CoV-2 among those >6 months to 4 years of age. Among the 1273 ARI 
hospitalisations with a SARS-CoV-2 test, there were 82 individuals who tested positive. The majority (n 
= 78) of the SARS-CoV-2 positive hospitalisations were among individuals who were unvaccinated. 
The recommendation for vaccination among individuals ≥6 months to 4 years of age came in May of 
2022 and the primary series was 3 doses. As a result, the time period for evaluation for this analysis 
was extended to 23 July 2022 (date of first ≥6 month to 4 years of age vaccination at KPSC) through 
07 April 2023 for this age group and included ED, UC or OP visits. The overall two dose BNT162b2 
effectiveness was 45% (95% CI: 25-59).

MAH discussion (related to the paediatric population) 
Key results 
Paediatric BNT162b2 effectiveness was limited in KPSC due to the timing of the recommendations and 
the low prevalence of hospitalisation. This is in line with other observational studies in these age 
groups which are limited to reporting less severe outcomes, (i.e., infection). We included VE against 
emergency department and urgent care visits for 5-11 years of age and emergency department, 
urgent care and outpatient visits for >6 months to 4 years showing effectiveness at 2 doses. 
Limitations 
There were several limitations to take into consideration when interpreting the findings. The study was 
observational, and therefore cannot establish causal relationships between vaccination and COVID-19 
outcomes. Although both a full cohort and test-negative design analyses were planned, as the 
pandemic evolved, biases that could not be controlled using the cohort design prevented executing the 
cohort analysis beyond the first year of the study. The most significant bias was introduced by changes 
in testing and health-seeking behaviour as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed that differed based on 
vaccination status. The test-negative design restricted the study population to those who have a SARS-
CoV-2 test, thereby minimizing biases caused by health-seeking behaviour, including the propensity to 
test. 
While we used a test-negative design and statistical methods to control for confounding, there may be 
unmeasured confounding. To address differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing behaviours, patterns, and 
other characteristics between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, we adjusted vaccine effectiveness 
estimates to account for confounding. We did not have data on occupation or adherence to non-
pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask wearing or social distancing, which could also affect SARS-
CoV-2 testing. 
We compared cases and test-negative controls from the same variant time periods to balance testing 
availability, infection rates, and other inputs that may affect health behaviours and SARS-CoV-2 
testing. However, it is possible that hospital admission practices changed during the study period. For 
example, if more individuals with less severe infection were admitted during the Omicron period, as 
reported by CDC the vaccine effectiveness estimates could be biased downward. Due to the timeframe 
in which vaccines became available to the paediatric population and the smaller sample size, we were

unable to compare paediatric cases to test-negative controls from the same variant period. In addition, 
VE estimates that resulted in a 95% confidence interval width greater than 50 percentage points were 
deemed non-reportable due to imprecision. 
Due to the timeframe in which vaccines became available to the paediatric population and the 
predominant circulating variant, many of the paediatric VE analyses in KPSC required adjustment. Due 
to the small number of hospitalisations among the paediatric population, VE could only be calculated 
for adolescents 12-17 years of age during the Delta time period. 
Among those 5-11 years of age, VE was calculated against ED and UC visits. Among those >6 months 
to 4 years, VE was calculated against ED, UC and OP visits and the study time period was extended 
through 07 April 2023 to capture as many children as possible. Both 5-11 years of age and >6 months 
to 4 years of age VE were only calculated during omicron study period. It should also be noted that the 
number of people with a history of prior infection increased over time and that this may be non-
differentially distributed between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. This may be especially true 
among children, who received vaccinations later into the course of the pandemic. This could bias VE 
estimates downward towards the null. The impact of prior infection on VE was evaluated in stratified 
analysis and was accounted for as a covariate in adjusted VE analyses. Because prior infection can act 
as an effect modifier, simple adjustment may lead to biased VE estimates. 
Immunocompromising status and comorbidities were not time-varying in the analyses, but rather 
based on health records in the year prior to the patient’s index date. This may create misclassification 
bias depending on changing status throughout the entire study period. 
Further, prior infection may be underestimated in this study because data was limited to what was 
available in the patient’s record. There was a systematic mechanism to report SARS-CoV-2 testing that 
was administered outside the system or through at-home tests, but not all may have been reported. 
Furthermore, underreporting may have occurred because not all infected individuals are tested for 
SARS-CoV-2. 
Key strata were deemed vital in understanding VE as the pandemic evolved including circulating 
variant, number of doses and time since last dose. Unfortunately, there were many instances where VE 
could not be calculated reliably when stratified by these or in combination with other subpopulations of 
interest such as age or immunocompromising status. Any VE estimates that resulted in a 95% 
confidence interval width greater than 50 percentage points were deemed unstable due to imprecision 
and need to be interpreted with caution. 
There were some variables that were deemed important to adjust for at the initiation of the study 
period that were either unavailable in the data set or not reliably captured to be included in the 
analysis. Sequencing was included in all the studies, but results for every patient were unavailable. As 
a result, VE analyses were stratified by the predominant circulating variant at the time in the country. 
This may lead to some misclassification bias, especially during times when variants were changing or 
when multiple variants were co-circulating. Although valuable data, the overall VE was comparable to 
other studies and was consistent across these three studies. 
The TND study may be subject to selection bias. The proportion of individuals requiring hospitalisation 
due to COVID-19 decreased over time. It is possible that some cases were hospitalised or had ED 
admissions “with COVID-19” rather than “for COVID-19.” This could result in spurious findings of 
waning VE against severe outcomes if vaccine breakthroughs were only incidental infections among 
individuals admitted to the hospital for something other than COVID-19. We restricted the analysis to 
only individuals admitted with a diagnosis of acute respiratory infection, however, it is possible that 
milder cases were included in the analysis and biased the vaccine effectiveness downwards. The

decreasing case severity over time may have also made VE estimates from the different variant- 
predominant periods less comparable 
Interpretation 
Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that BNT162b2 was effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 
hospitalisation and ED visits in the real-world setting and support the efficacy seen in the clinical trials.  
BNT162b2 was effective across all paediatric age groups studied and across multiple predominant 
circulating variant time periods. The data in these analyses confirm the need for booster dosing to 
maintain protection, as VE appeared to wane over time and was restored with subsequent boosters. 
Although BNT162b2 was effective during all variant time periods, VE was substantially lower during the 
Omicron variant time period, underscoring the need for adapted vaccines to match the circulating 
strain. The overall benefit risk profile remains favourable for BNT162b2 vaccination for the prevention 
of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Generalizability 
This observational study used real-world data to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine in routine 
clinical care. KPSC is a large, integrated healthcare system that is representative of the socioeconomic, 
racial, and ethnic diversity of the area’s population. The test-negative study design reduced bias in 
health-seeking behaviours, however, generalizability of the results was limited to individuals who had 
access to healthcare services and received SARS-CoV-2 testing. The results were not generalizable to 
variants or time periods of variant circulation not included in the study. 
Conclusions 
BNT162b2 was effective across all paediatric age groups studied across multiple clinically important 
predominant circulating variant time periods. The data in these analyses also confirm the need for 
booster dosing to maintain protection, as VE appeared to wane over time and was restored with 
subsequent boosters. Differences seen in VE based on predominating circulating variants suggest the 
potential need for adapted vaccines to match the circulating strain. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This report contains the final study results for study C4591014 (Kaiser), a non-interventional, 
retrospective, category 3 RMP study, investigating the real-world effectiveness of BNT162b2, that was 
due 30 June 2023. While the scope of the total study is much broader and contains a large amount of 
data for an adult population, this report only concerns the paediatric portion of the study. 
The primary objective of the study was to in estimate the effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against 
hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a test-negative 
design. However, this endpoint proved to be difficult for the age group 12-17 years old due to the 
limited number of acute respiratory infection hospitalisations, and practically impossible for the age 
groups 6 months – 11 years of age due to limited sample size, the timing of the recommendations, 
changes in circulating virus strains and other factors listed under “Limitations” in the subheading “MAH 
discussion”.  
For the age group 12-17 years of age, the overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness of 2 doses of 
BNT162b2 against hospitalisation due to SARS-CoV-2 among individuals 12-17 years of age who were 
diagnosed with an acute respiratory infection was 55% (95% CI: 23-74). However, there were large 
differences between the VE against hospitalisation due to SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta-variant period 
(92%, 95% CI: 71-98) and the overall VE, corroborating previous findings that the efficacy of the 
original BNT162b2 was considerably lower against the Omicron-variant.

For the age group 5-11 years of age, the investigators chose to calculate BNT162b2 effectiveness 
against ARI-associated ED or UC visits as an alternative to VE against covid-mediated hospitalisation. 
Due to the timing of the recommendation for vaccination in this age group, BNT162b2 VE against Delta 
could not be calculated and the overall estimate for this age group was limited to the Omicron 
circulating variant. The adjusted BNT162b2 effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ARI-
associated ED or UC visits due to SARS-CoV-2 among individuals 5-11 years of age was 44% (95% CI: 
34-53) and of 3 doses was 77% (95% CI: 55-88). The effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 was 56% 
(95% CI: 45-65) at less than 3 months but fell to 32% (95% CI: 15-45) after 3 months since 
vaccination. VE was restored with a booster dose 75% (95% CI: 52-87) within 3 months since 
vaccination. 
Similar to the other paediatric age groups, for the cohort >6 months to 4 years of age, the limited 
number of ARI hospitalisations prompted the investigators to instead calculate VE for ED, UC or OP 
visits. The investigators write that: “the recommendation for vaccination among individuals ≥6 months 
to 4 years of age came in May of 2022 and the primary series was 3 doses. As a result, the time period 
for evaluation for this analysis was extended to 23 July 2022 (date of first ≥6 month to 4 years of age 
vaccination at KPSC) through 07 April 2023 for this age group and included ED, UC or OP visits. The 
overall two dose BNT162b2 effectiveness was 45% (95% CI: 25-59)”. The unadjusted VE for three 
doses (completed primary series) is stated to be 48%.  
In total, the real-world data provided in this procedure generally corroborate what has been previously 
shown in controlled clinical trials with regard to the key findings: the original formulation was highly 
effective in preventing COVID-mediated ARI hospitalisation during the Delta-circulating period, 
however, efficacy dropped considerably during the Omicron-wave. The study also corroborates that 
immunity wanes within a couple of months, but is boosted upon administration of a booster dose (at 
least, for the 12-17 years age group that had chance to be boosted).  
The drawbacks of any non-interventional, retrospective study render it difficult to draw more 
conclusions than these stated above.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH has completed a clinical study investigating the real-world effectiveness of BNT162b2 in a 
paediatric population. Although the number of hospitalisations were too low to estimate a reliable 
estimate for these age cohorts, the real-world data provided in this procedure generally corroborate 
what has been previously shown in controlled clinical trials with regard to the key findings: the original 
formulation was highly effective in preventing COVID-mediated acute respiratory infection 
hospitalisation during the Delta-circulating period, however, efficacy dropped considerably during the 
Omicron-wave. The study also corroborates that immunity wanes within a couple of months but is 
boosted upon administration of a booster dose (at least, for the 12-17 years age group that had 
chance to be boosted).

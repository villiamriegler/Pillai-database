Ibrutinib (Imbruvica, PCI-32765) is a first-in-class, potent, orally-administered, covalently binding 
inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). 
The European Commission has approved ibrutinib in the EU for the following clinical situations:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
IMBRUVICA  as  a  single  agent  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory MCL. 
IMBRUVICA  as  a  single  agent  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously 
untreated CLL. 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy. 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM who have 
received  at  least  one  prior  therapy,  or  in  first  line  treatment  for  patients  unsuitable  for  chemo 
immunotherapy. 
The current Type II variation concerns an extension of indication of the approval of ibrutinib in 
combination of rituximab for the treatment of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), 
regardless of line of therapy. Proposed addition to the existing indication statement for WM is shown 
below in italic text: 
“IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's 
macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for 
patients unsuitable for chemo immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with WM”.

Background on the Target Indication/Current Treatment  
Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct lymphoproliferative B-cell disorder characterized by 
infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells into the bone marrow along with demonstration of an 
immunoglobulin (Ig) M monoclonal gammopathy in the serum. It is a subtype of lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma (LPL) as defined by the Revised European-American Lymphoma and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification systems. The majority of LPL are WM. The definition WM exclude 
presentations of LPL associated with IgA or IgG gammopathies.  
WM, which constitutes 1–2% of hematologic malignancies, is an orphan indication; the overall incidence 
in EU is estimated to be 7.3 and 4.2 per million among males and females, respectively and is a disease 
of the elderly, with incidence increasing with age, and median age being over 70 years. The most 
recognized risk factor for developing WM is IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance 
(MGUS), which confers a 46-fold higher relative risk compared to the general population.  
Clinical manifestations of WM include cytopenias resulting from bone marrow infiltration by 
lymphoplasmacytic cells and IgM paraprotein related symptoms such as cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin 
syndrome, demyelinating neuropathy, and symptomatic hyperviscosity. In more rare cases, symptoms 
are derived from lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly/organomegaly. 
WM remains an incurable disease with variability in outcome. Approximately 75% of patients are 
symptomatic and therefore require treatment to control symptoms related to tumor burden. 
Asymptomatic patients should be observed and serum IgM levels alone are not a basis for treatment. 
Factors associated with a poor prognosis include advanced age (>65 years); β2-microglobulin >3 mg/L; 
anemia (hemoglobin ≤11.5 g/dL); thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤100 x 109/L); and IgM monoclonal 
gammopathy (IgM >7.0 g/dL). Based on these key factors an international prognostic scoring system for 
newly diagnosed patients with WM was developed (WM IPSS score), indicating that the 5-year survival 
rates range from 36% to 87% in high- and low-risk patients, respectively.

Rationale for Use of Ibrutinib in WM 
Given the rarity of WM, most of the current treatment regimens have been adopted fron data derived fron 
phase 2 studies and less often from prospective trials addressed to WM as well as to other indolent B-cells 
lymphomas. 
The rationale for the use of ibrutinib in this study was based on the results from a Phase 1 dose-escalation 
study (PCYC-04753), and an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 study (PCYC-1118E (NCT01614821) 
hereafter named study 1118E) that demonstrated single-agent activity in subjects with previously 
treated WM.  
Recently, a somatic mutation of the MYD88 gene (L265P), was identified that appears to drive WM growth 
and proliferation. This mutation conveys tonic MYD88-interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK) 
signalling that activates BTK and the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-kB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are important for the growth and 
survival of WM cells. 
Ibrutinib blocks MYD88 signalling downstream of BTK and leads to apoptosis of WM cell lines. Thus, 
ibrutinib specifically targets the molecular pathogenetic mechanism of WM.  The prospective, Phase 2 
single arm study of ibrutinib in previously treated patients with WM, study 1118E, demonstrated clinical 
benefit and a favorable safety profile, which 2015 lead to approval of ibrutinib in patients with WM.  
Ibrutinib is, presently, the only therapeutic agent centrally approved for the treatment of WM in the EU, 
both in previously treated patients and as first-line treatment in patients for whom 
chemo-immunotherapy is unsuitable.

Rituximab is not approved by in the EU for the treatment of WM, nonetheless it is the most commonly 
utilized agent in clinical practice, mostly in combination with chemotherapy and is recommended in 
European and US treatment guidelines to treat patients with treatment-naïve and previously treated WM. 
Monotherapy rituximab is known to exert its effect with low toxicity profile, lack of impact on the 
mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells, non-myelosuppressive treatment profile, and response rates 
either as a single agent (range: 20% to 45%) or in combination regimens (70% to 90%). Rituximab 
monotherapy is well tolerated although transient increases in serum IgM levels (IgM flare) have been 
reported in approximately 50% of patients and the most common adverse events were infusion-related 
reactions. An extended rituximab regimen (rituximab for 4 weeks and for those without progression at 
week 12, 4 additional weekly infusions of rituximab) reported higher response rates (44% and 48%). 
Chemo immunotherapy (CIT) is a potent therapeutic option for WM due to the additive clinical effect of 
rituximab with purine analogues, alkylating agents, or proteasome inhibitors However, these combination 
therapies are often associated with more short- and long-term toxicity, including high rates of 
myelosuppression and myelodysplasia, in a population already vulnerable from the symptoms associated 
with the underlying disease. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new data for the environmental risk assessment were provided with this application. A complete ERA 
has been provided in previous procedures, and considered acceptable. For this application, the MAH has 
provided an updated market forecast for calculation of PEC/PNEC ratios. These ratios remain far below 1.   
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. From the 
ERA update the conclusion remains: The clinical use of ibrutinib is not expected to be a risk for the 
environment as there will be no significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
imbruitinib.

Methods 
Study drug administration 
In the study, treatment Arm A was administered ibrutinib (3 x 140 mg oral capsules) 420 mg/day and 
Rituximab (intravenous administration) 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a second 
four-weekly rituximab course after a three-month interval. Treatment Arm B was administered Placebo (3 
capsules/day) and Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a second 
four-weekly rituximab course after a three-month interval.  
In the open-label sub-study (Arm C) ibrutinib 420 mg/day was administered until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Subjects were instructed to take the capsules at approximately the same time each day with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water. On day of Week 4, Day 22 PK visit (Arm A/B), ibrutinib/placebo was 
administered 0-30 minutes before rituximab infusion.

Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical method (BTM-1792-R0) used for the measurement of ibrutinib and its metabolite 
PCI-452227 in study 1127 was previously assessed in application EMEA/H/C/3791/X/37. Blood samples 
(approximately 2 mL) were collected into Vacutainer® tubes containing sodium heparin from all subjects 
pre-dose. Plasma samples were stored at Frontage Laboratories at a nominal temperature of -70˚C. 
Samples were analysed by a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the determination of ibrutinib 
and PCI-45227 in heparinized human plasma. The method was validated for ibrutinib and PCI-45227 over 
the concentration range of 0.500 to 100 ng/mL. The plasma concentration of ibrutinib and the major 
metabolite, PCI-45227, were determined. An ISR evaluation for method BTM-1792-R0, using samples 
selected from study 1127, was conducted and met the acceptance criteria.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Plasma concentration data of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 from Arm A (ibrutinib + rituximab) and 
C (ibrutinib monotherapy) were analysed by non-compartmental methods using validated Phoenix 
WinNonlin software (Version 6.3). Blood samples were collected from all subjects pre-dose, at 1h (±15 
min), 2h (±30 min), 4h (±30 min) and 6h (±1h) on week 4 (study day 22, treatment arm a and B) and 
week 5 (study day 29, treatment arm C). 
All concentration values below the limit of quantitation were treated as 0 (zero) for pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Actual collection times relative to ibrutinib administration were used for the calculation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters. Pre-dose concentrations were applied as 24 hour concentrations in order to 
calculate steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for Week 4, Day 22 (Arm A) and Week 5, Day 29 
(Arm C). All mean concentration data were plotted using SigmaPlot (Version 12.0). 
The metabolite-to-parent (M/P) ratio for AUC and Cmax AUC was also calculated (to evaluate the effect of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors) using the following formula: (AUCPCI-45227/MWPCI-45227) / 
(AUCibrutinib/MWibrutinib) where MW is the molecular weight.  
Results 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 in individual subjects from Arm A 
(Week 4, Day 22) and Arm C (Week 5, Day 29) are presented in Table 2. Individual plasma concentration 
versus time profiles of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 in treatment arm A and C are illustrated in Figure 1.  
Following once daily oral administration of 420 mg ibrutinib in combination with rituximab (treatment arm 
A, week 4, day 22), the inter-subject variability for exposure parameters was 60.2% for Cmax, 59.0% for 
AUC0-24h, and 59.2% for AUClast. Following once daily oral administration of 420 mg ibrutinib alone 
(treatment arm C, week 5, day 29), the inter-subject variability for exposure parameters was 51.9% for 
Cmax and 60.6% for AUC0-24h and AUClast. 
Two subjects in treatment arm A and one subject in Arm C were co-administered with a moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor during the PK collection period. Due to a limited number of subjects with evaluable PK receiving 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the effect of moderate CYP3A inhibitor use on the pharmacokinetics of 
ibrutinib and PCI-45227 could not be evaluated.

Ibrutinib steady-state PK parameters determined by non-compartmental analysis from Study 1127 were 
also compared with the observations obtained in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 
small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) from Study 1102, where the ibrutinib administered dose was 420 
mg/day. The results indicated that ibrutinib exposure in Study 1127 in subjects with WM was consistent 
with the previous studies with ibrutinib administered at 420 mg/day. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No additional data on pharmacodynamics are submitted in this application 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant performed a multicentre, randomized double-blind study of rituximab and ibrutinib or 
rituximab and placebo (Arm A and Arm B, respectively) in patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia. 
In addition the applicant performed an open-label sub-study (Arm C) where patients received Ibrutinib as 
monotherapy. Results from treatment Arm A were compared with treatment Arm C. Plasma samples were 
not analysed for rituximab plasma concentrations, therefore, only the effect of rituximab on ibrutinib 
could be assessed.  
No tendencies towards clinically relevant PK-interactions of rituximab on ibrutinib could be observed. 
Mechanistically, no interaction between rituximab and ibrutinib is expected.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:>

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In an earlier study, study 1102, saturation of the BTK binding sites was confirmed at doses of 420 mg in 
the setting of CLL/SLL, why the 420 mg/day dosing regimen was chosen for ibrutinib in all subsequent 
clinical studies in WM (i.e. Studies 1118E and 1127). Ibrutinib monotherapy dosed 420 mg/day daily has 
demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile in subjects with previously treated WM, (study 1118E). 
Ibrutinib at 420 mg/day, in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) has been shown to 
be a safe, well-tolerated and an active treatment regimen in high-risk CLL subjects. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib or Placebo in 
Combination with Rituximab in Subjects with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia. 
Methods 
Study 1127 (iNNOVATE) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study in subjects 
with treatment-naïve and previously treated WM who received ibrutinib (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) in 
combination with rituximab to evaluate whether treatment with ibrutinib in combination with rituximab 
would result in an improvement in PFS compared with placebo in combination with rituximab. 
In addition, Study 1127 included an open-label substudy (Arm C) to further investigate the safety and 
efficacy of ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects with WM who were considered refractory to the last prior 
rituximab-containing therapy. Inclusion of this open-label monotherapy substudy was suggested by the 
Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) during the Scientific Advice procedure 
EMEA/H/SAH/022/1/2013/II as means of obtaining data in patients with rapidly progressive disease who 
were refractory to rituximab. 
Result from the earlier assessed 1118E study, ibrutinib monotherapy in previously treated WM, is 
presented below, in parallel with the results from the main study. A formal comparison of data between 
subjects who received ibrutinib as combination therapy with rituximab in the frontline setting with 
subjects who received single-agent ibrutinib in the relapsed or refractory setting is not appropriate; 
however, for ease of review in this submission, the MAH has presented data from the randomized part of 
Study 1127, the open-label monotherapy substudy of Study 1127, and Study 1118E side-by-side in a 
non-pooled format.   
Study participants 
Eligibility Criteria 
The eligibility criteria for Study 1127 fulfilled general requirements for establishing a study population 
reflective of the target patient population. Eligible subjects were ≥18 years of age, symptomatic requiring 
treatment, and were required to have, untreated or previously treated, WM. Exclusion criteria for this 
study were chosen based on common practice in oncology studies and the safety profile of ibrutinib.  
The subject selection criteria in the protocol defined the patient population, who had symptomatic disease 
requiring treatment based on meeting at least 1 of the recommendations from the Second International 
Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia for requiring treatment. The patients were also required to 
meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria such as adequate hematological and organ function and no

life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that allowed evaluation of the 
chemotherapy-free regimen (ibrutinib+rituximab) in this population. 
 Key inclusion criteria 
Eligible subjects were ≥ 18 years of age with; 
• Untreated WM or previously treated WM (previously treated subjects must have had documented 
disease  
• Centrally confirmed clinicopathological diagnosis of WM in accordance with the consensus panel of the 
Second IWWM. 
• Measurable disease defined as serum monoclonal IgM > 0.5 g/dL, 
• Symptomatic disease meeting at least 1 of the recommendations from the Second IWWM for requiring 
treatment. (See below). 
• Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio 
levels as defined in the protocol,  
• ECOG PS ≤ 2. 
Key exclusion criteria included 
• Known involvement of the central nervous system by WM  
• Disease refractory to prior rituximab-containing therapy (defined as relapse after the last rituximab 
containing therapy < 12 months since last dose of rituximab), or failure to achieve at least an MR (≥ 25% 
reduction but < 50% of serum IgM from baseline) after the last rituximab-containing therapy,  
• Rituximab treatment within the last 12 months before the first dose of study drug.  
• Subjects with a history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 12 months prior to enrollment, or 
with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or known bleeding disorder 
Open-label Substudy 
Eligible subjects must have met the inclusion criteria for the randomized study, and in addition, had 
disease that was refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy (defined as either relapse after 
the last rituximab-containing therapy < 12 months since last dose of rituximab, or failure to achieve at 
least an MR after the last rituximab-containing therapy). 
The exclusion criteria were identical to those for the randomized study except for those criteria related to 
prior rituximab use (outlined above for the randomized study), which did not apply to the open-label 
substudy.  
Symptomatic disease was defined by constitutional symptoms (recurrent fever, night sweats, fatigue due 
to anemia, or weight loss); Presence of progressive, symptomatic lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly; 
anaemia (haemoglobin value of <or= 10 g/dL) due to marrow infiltration; Platelet count < 100 x 109/L 
due to marrow infiltration; Complications such as IgM-related hyperviscosity syndrome, symptomatic 
sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, systemic amyloidosis, renal insufficiency, or symptomatic 
cryoglobulinemia may also be indications for therapy.

Treatments 
Figure 2: Study schema, randomised part of study 
Open-label Substudy 
Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 capsules) was to be orally administered daily beginning Day 1 of Week 1. 
All subjects in Arms A and B received rituximab and followed the package insert for rituximab dosing and 
toxicity management.

Co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors was to be avoided during the study. If a 
strong CYP3A inhibitor was used, the ibrutinib dose was to be reduced to 140 mg or treatment withheld 
temporarily for the duration of the inhibitor use. Any chemotherapy, anti-cancer immunotherapy, 
experimental therapy, or radiotherapy was prohibited during the treatment phase of the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of the addition of ibrutinib to rituximab on PFS assessed 
by an independent review committee (IRC) in subjects with WM. Efficacy evaluations were to be based on 
the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VIth International Workshop on Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia (IWWM). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
Progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by the IRC based on the modified Consensus Response 
Criteria from the VIth International Workshop for WM.  
Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints which will be tested include the following: 
•  Overall response rate (ORR) assessed by IRC (≥ partial response [PR]; according to the modified 
VIth IWWM criteria). 
•  Time to next treatment (TTnT) 
•  Rate of sustained Hgb improvement. 
•  Proportion of subjects with ≥ 3 points increase from baseline by Week 25 in FACIT-fatigue 
experience score from the FACT-An 5 items assessing fatigue symptoms. 
•  Overall survival (OS), planned OS would not be tested at the interim analysis. 
Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and eye-related symptoms. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
PFS by investigator (INV), ORR (INV), time to sustained Hgb improvement, DOR (IRC and INV), CRR(IRC 
and INV), medical resource utilization (MRU), IgM, Hgb, lymph nodes and spleen measures, tumor 
involvement of bone marrow, EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale and utility score, FACTAn total score and 
subscale scores.

Table 4: Modified 6th WM Response Criteria (NCCN 2014) for Investigator Assessment 
Efficacy evaluation included the following components: Hematologic parameters by complete blood 
count; quantitative IgM serum immunoglobulins; quantitative serum-M protein; qualitative serum 
immunofixation / radiographic evaluation / bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (if applicable).  
Determination of progression for the purpose of the primary efficacy endpoint was to be performed by the 
IRC. The IRC was established to conduct progression and response assessments centrally according to 
the committee’s charter, and for subjects with nodal/extranodal disease at screening, to determine 
imaging requirements for the subject at follow-up visits. 
The safety and the interim analysis of this study were monitored by an independent DMC.

Sample size 
Randomized Study 
The 1127 study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and was powered for this 
endpoint. The sample size and power calculations were based on a 2-sided log-rank test for PFS and the 
following considerations: 1:1 randomization ratio between 2 treatment arms; target HR of 0.5 which 
corresponds to a 2-fold increase in median PFS for Ibr+R arm relative to the Pbo+R arm (median PFS 30 
months vs. 15 months) with exponential distribution for PFS; minimum 80% power; 2-sided overall 
significance level of 0.05; and 1 interim analysis at 70% information (~50 PFS events). 
Open-label Substudy 
The sample size for the substudy was not determined according to statistical calculation. Thirty-one 
subjects were enrolled in the substudy. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Patients were centrally randomized in study 1127. The treatment assignment was stratified using the 
following factors: 
• WM IPSS assessed at screening (low vs. intermediate vs. high). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644926/2019  
Page 19/20 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
 
• Number of prior systemic treatment regimens (0 vs. 1-2 vs. ≥ 3). 
• ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2). 
The subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to each of the 2 treatment arms (Ibr+R arm, Pbo+R 
arm) within each randomization stratum. This randomization scheme was implemented within the 
interactive web response system (IWRS) based on information entered by clinical site staff at time of 
randomization. The subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor’s study team members were blinded to 
treatment assignment.  
Table 5: Subgroups for analyses in the Randomised study 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of efficacy and safety, with the data extract completed on 17 October 2017  
represented a pre-specified interim analysis for the randomized study was planned for 50 IRC confirmed 
PFS events and the final analysis was planned for 71 PFS events.  
The interim analysis was based on a group sequential design with Lan-DeMets spending function with 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary. Using the above assumptions and based on an estimated accrual rate of 
approximately 12 subjects per month, the study was to enroll approximately 150 subjects (about 75 
subjects to each arm) to observe 71 events in approximately 27 months from the first subject 
randomized. The interim analysis was conducted with 56 IRC-confirmed PFS events representing 79% of 
the planned total PFS events. Significance level of 2-sided alpha 0.023 for the interim analysis was 
determined based on the actual number of IRC-confirmed PFS events using O'Brien-Fleming boundary. 
This interim analysis crossed the superiority boundary and therefore is considered as the primary PFS 
analysis for the study, triggered by DMC recommendation after the review of interim efficacy analysis 
results. 
Two of the 3 randomization stratification factors, WM IPSS (low, intermediate, high), and number of prior 
systemic treatment regimens (0, ≥ 1), were used for stratified analyses/tests. Progression-free survival 
per IRC assessment was summarized for each treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and 
compared using a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratio (HR) (Ibr+R/Pbo+R) and its 95% confidence

interval (CI) based on a Cox regression model stratified by the 2 randomization stratification factors were 
calculated. 
The primary endpoint reached statistical significance, therefore tests of secondary endpoints were 
performed at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 in a hierarchical order based on a closed testing 
procedure: 1) response rate, 2) TTnT, 3) rate of sustained Hgb improvement, and 4) proportion of 
subjects with ≥ 3 points increase from baseline by Week 25 in the FACIT-Fatigue subscale score. As 
planned, OS was not tested at the interim analysis and will be tested at the time of the final analysis. 
For the open-label substudy, efficacy outcomes were analyzed separately from the randomized study. 
Times to event variables were analyzed using KM estimate. For categorical variables, 95% CIs were 
calculated based on the exact binomial distribution.

Numbers analysed 
Data from the randomized part of Study 1127, the open-label monotherapy substudy of Study 1127, and 
Study 1118E are presented side-by-side in a non-pooled format.  
The interim analysis was conducted with 56 PFS events representing 79% of the planned total PFS events. 
A total of 150 subjects were included in the randomised part in Study 1127 (75 patients in each arm) and 
31 subjects were included in the monotherapy sub-study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
A formal comparison of data between subjects who received ibrutinib as combination therapy with 
rituximab in the frontline setting with subjects who received single-agent ibrutinib in the relapsed or 
refractory setting is not appropriate; however, for ease of review in this submission, the applicant has 
chosen to present  
Figure 3: Primary endpoint: Progression free survival by IRC (Arm A and B) 
Median PFS per IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R 
arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC assessment at 30 months were 81.6% for 
the Ibr+R arm and 27.5% for the Pbo+R arm. This translates to a reduced the risk of progression or death 
by 80% for Ibr-R compared with Pbo+R; (HR=0.202; 95% CI: 0.107, 0.380; p <0.0001). 
PFS per investigator assessment was consistent with the IRC assessment (HR=0.218; 95% CI: 0.118, 
0.404; p <0.0001).

Exploratory analyses: Duration of respons (IRC and INV) 
For responding patients, the median DOR was not reached for the Ibr+R arm while it was 21.2 months for 
the Pbo+R group. A landmark analysis at 24 months showed 92.2% for the Ibr+R arm and 40.8% for the 
Pbo-R arm. 
As per investigator assessment, DOR was not reached for the Ibr+R arm, while it was 23 months for the 
Pbo+R group. Corresponding landmark analysis at 24 months was 89.0% versus 40.6%. 
 Exploratory analyses: Clinical response rate (INV) 
In contrast to response rate (RR) the clinical response rate (CRR) also includes minor response rate (MR). 
The CRR was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm vs. 46.7% for the Pbo+R arm.  
- CRR for previously untreated patients was 91.2% for the Ibr+R arm and 58.8% for the Pbo+R arm, 
while CRR for previously treated patients was 92.7% for the Ibr+R arm and 36.6% for the Pbo+R arm. 
- CRR for subjects with the MYD88 L265P mutation was 96.6% for the Ibr+R arm versus 48.3% for the 
Pbo+R arm. Corresponding CRR for subjects without MYD88 L265P mutation was 81.8% and 55.6%. 
Exploratory analyses: Hemoglobin change over time  
The median Hgb increased continuously from baseline and onwards in both arms. In the Ibr+R arm 
median baseline Hgb was 104.5 g/L and ranged between 129.5 to 133.0 during weeks 41-97, whereas 
the corresponding value in Pbo+R was 99.5 g/L (baseline) raising to 127.0 to 129.0 g/L (week 41-97). 
Exploratory analyses: disease evaluations in other compartments 
In study 1127, 56/75 and 58/75 patients in the Ibr+r and Pbo+R arms, respectively, presented with 
lymphadenopathy. Responding patients, in both treatment arms, showed reduction in lymph node 
volume and spleen size. The bone marrow compartment also showed a decreased percentage of

lymphoplasmacytic cells in response to treatment, compared to baseline;   the absolute number of 
patients in the Pbo+R arm that underwent a second bone marrow assessment was only 32 out of the 74 
initial patients. The correponding numbers in the Ibr+R arm were 54/75. 
Exploratory analyses:Medical resource utilisation 
In the Ibr+R arm no patients had a plasmapheresis, while 12 subjects in the Pbo+R arm had at least one 
(median 3.5) plasmapheresis.  
The median number of subjects hospitalized, the median number of hospitalizations and the number of 
subjects with emergency room visits were all higher in the Ibr+R arm as compared to the Pbo+R arm.  
Exploratory analyses: Infusion related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions of any grade (based on a custom SMQ) occurred in 48.0 % of subjects in the 
Ibr+R vs. 61.3 % of subjects in the Pbo+R arm. Grade 3 or higher event rates were 1.3 % vs. 16.0 % for 
the Ibr+R vs. Pbo+R arms, respectively. 
Exploratory analyses:EQ-5D-5L Visual analog scale andExploratory analyses:FACT-An assessments 
The change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale and utility score using the mixed model for 
repeated measures showed no differences between the treatment arms. The change from baseline in 
FACIT-Fatigue and FACT-An scores using the mixed model for repeated measures did not show any 
difference between the treatment arms. 
Exploratory analyses: Biomarker 
Apart from the PFS results and the RR reported for MYD88 L265P MYD88WT presented above, data on the 
subgoups MYD88L265P/CXCR4WT, MYD88L265P/CXCR4WHIM, and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT was also presented. 
Among baseline samples from 150 subjects in the Ibr+R and Pbo+R arms, 136 samples provided assay 
results.

reason for initiating treatment was constitutional symptoms, fatigue, Hgb <=10g/dL and 
lymphadenopathy. All patients had received rituximab the median number of prior rituximab therapies 
was 2 (range: 1 to 6). Medium number of prior treatments in the randomized part, study 1127, was 2. 
MYD88 L265P mutations were present in 77.4% of subjects, absent in 1 subject, and 19.4% of subjects 
were not evaluable for mutation status. 
One subject in the open-label substudy was reported with an important protocol deviation and it is 
unlikely to have affected the overall efficacy and safety results of the substudy. 
Primary endpoint: Progression free survival (Arm C, IRC and INV) 
The median PFS was not reached (IRC: 95% CI: 27.4, NE; INV: 95% CI: 27.6, NE). The Kaplan-Meier 
point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC and investigator assessment for the open-label monotherapy 
substudy were 80.6% and 87.1% at 18 months, respectively, and 57.5% (95% CI: 38.2, 72.7) and 
64.4% (95% CI: 44.9, 78.4) at 30 months, respectively.

Secondary endpoints (Arm C, IRC and INV): 
Response rate (>PR) per IRC was 71.0%, and per INV assessment 77.4%. The majority of responses 
were PR with no CR.   
The median TTnT was not reached; at the 30-month landmark estimate 82.9% had not received 
subsequent treatment. Five of the 31 subjects received subsequent treatment.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Please refer to subgroup analysis of PFS, on the age, gender and prior treatment status (previously 
treated or untreated) subgroups and in subjects with or without MYD88 mutation. 
Supportive study 
The previously submitted single-arm data from Study 1118E (N=63) is presented side by side to data 
from the present study 1127 (N=150) and the monotherapy substudy (31); allowing for the comparison 
of the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab (Study 1127) or as a single agent. No formally 
integrated statistical analyses were performed. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the present CSR, key efficacy data from Study 1127 (n=150 for the randomized part [A and B], n=31 
for the open-label monotherapy substudy [Arm C]) are presented and efficacy data from Study 
PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as study 1118E, N=63) are also presented as comparison. The earlier 
study 1118E was a single-arm, multicentre, Phase 2 study of single agent ibrutinib in adult subjects with 
previously treated WM, and forms the basis of the current approved WM indication in the EU SmPC. 
Dose evaluation was presented in the previously assessed study 1118E. No new data is presented in the 
present CSR, which is acceptable.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application in WM is based on the results obtained in the phase 3 study 1127 consisting of a 2-armed 
randomised double blind study (n=150, Ibr+R vs Pbo+R) and a single arm study (n=31, monotherapy 
ibrutinib) with both untreated and previously treated WM (randomised part) and previously treated WM 
also considered rituximab refractory (monotherapy part). Efficacy data are also shown, in a side-by-side 
manor, with data from an earlier assessed ibrutinib monotherapy study, 1118E. 
The study design was developed considering the scientific advice from regulatory agencies, including 
CHMP in 2014. PFS was considered an acceptable endpoint according to this advice. Due to the fact that 
no single substance, including rituximab, was approved for the treatment of WM, the comparator was 
discussed. Given the lack of truly evidenced-based therapy, rituximab was considered acceptable by 
CHMP as comparator and backbone therapy, acknowledging that the reference therapy would be a 
non-licenced comparator. However CIT (rituximab +chemotherapy) was also considered acceptable. It 
was suggested that subjects progressing on placebo-rituximab treatment would be able to switch to 
ibrutinib, given the previous approval. Furthermore, the importance of PFS2 was emphasised because of 
the unequal duration of treatment between arms. 
In the present study (the randomised part) 54.7% of the patients had received previous treatment for 
WM. Subjects in the untreated cohort (n=68, 45.3%) had received no prior WM therapy; subjects in the 
previously treated cohort (n=82, 54.7%) had received a median of 2 prior WM therapies.  
The majority of recommended therapies for WM are anti-CD-based (rituximab-based) combinations with 
chemotherapeutic agents or a proteasome inhibitor. The use of rituximab monotherapy, although 
included in European guidelines among other treatment options for relapsed patients, is associated with 
lower response rates compared to combination regiments and short duration of response and actually 
recommended only for patients with comorbidities precluding the use of more effective 
chemo-immunotherapies. In a recent large retrospective chart review (Lancet Haematol 2018, C Buske et 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644926/2019  
Page 43/44 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
al) only 6% of patients received Rituximab monotherapy as first line and second line therapy. In third line 
setting, monotherapy rituximab was administered in 11% of the patients.  
The MAH presented data on the use of monotherapy treatments, including rituximab, at the time of study 
design and further emphasized the wide heterogeneity in the choice of treatments and also the absence 
of standard of care. Rituximab was one of the most commonly used monotherapy regimens and a 
relatively non-toxic treatment option that provided adequate clinical responses and was therefore 
considered to be an appropriate comparator in both the treatment-naïve and previously treated setting. 
The goal to explore and chemotherapy-free treatment alternative for WM was supported by the WM 
Consortium Group.   
Efficacy evaluation is based on the modified consensus response criteria from the VIth International 
workshop for WM (NCC2014).  
The sample size calculation was based on an assumption of 15 months median PFS in the control arm. The 
actual observed PFS was considerably longer and hence suggest that the general condition of the 
population is healthier than expected. The stratification factors were changed twice during the study due 
to changes in inclusion criteria. None of the changes to stratification factors across protocol amendments 
affected the balance in the randomization. No subjects were enrolled or randomized under the original 
protocol. Therefore, this change did not affect the balance in the randomization. Amendment 1 only 
allowed for inclusion of subjects with previously treated WM. In protocol Amendment 2 (dated 09 
February 2015), the second randomization factor was modified to “Number of prior systemic treatment 
regimens (0, 1-2, vs. ≥3)” and to add subjects with previously untreated WM. The randomization scheme 
#2 was then generated for the previously untreated subjects. All the previously treated subjects were 
randomized according to the randomization scheme #1 and all the untreated subjects were randomized 
according to the randomization scheme #2. The addition of untreated subjects did not affect the balance 
in the randomization.   
The median number of prior treatments in the monotherapy cohort was 4. In Study 1118E; subjects 
received a median of 2 prior therapies for WM. 
In Study 1127 and the open-label monotherapy substudy ~77 % of subjects had a MYD88 L265P 
mutation. The mutation status in Study 1118E was not available. 
The recommended dose regimen for ibrutinib for WM is unchanged (ie, 420 mg administered orally once 
daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) and based on earlier studies in WM and CLL/SLL. 
The median age of the study population was 70.0 years for the Ibr+R arm and 68.0 years for the Pbo+R 
arm (range, 36 to 89 years) and the monotherapy arm was 67 years (range, 47 to 90 years). 
Approximately 60% of the patients were above the 65 year cut-off, with older age defining a strong 
adverse factor in the prognostic score. This median age corresponds rather well to the median age 
reported for newly diagnosed WM. The majority of the subjects were recruited from the EU (60%) and 12 
% and 13 % from the US and Canada, respectively. Considering that the majority of patients recruited in 
the EU, a discussion on potential differences in the clinical management/therapy of WM between US and 
the EU region is in place. 
First PFS interim analysis was positive and considered by the applicant to be the final analysis. 
The protocol deviations are not considered to be of major importance for the interpretation of the study 
results. 
Treatment was initiated in a larger proportion of patients in the control arm (Pbo+R) due to constitutional 
symptom(38.7% vs 25.3%); Hgb < 10 g/dL (100 g/L), (37.3% vs 26.7%); fatigue (65.3 % vs 56 %); 
symptomatic organomegaly and/or organ tissue infiltration (9.3% vs 2.7%); IgM related immune 
Assessment report

haemolytic anemia/trombocytopenia (5.3% vs 0%); platelet count < 100x109 (8.0 5 vs 2.7%). More 
patients in the Ibr+R arm had their treatment initiated, in a larger proportion due to peripheral 
neuropathy (20% vs 10.7%) and serum IgM >5 g/dL (24% vs 16%). Peripheral neuropathy due to serum 
monoclonal protein is a, however clinically significant, heterogeneous group of disorders but not always 
accompanied with other reasons to initiate treatment for WM, hence as reason for initiation of therapy, 
neuropathy is difficult to assess in the context of efficacy assessments and the study endpoints. In 
response to RSI, the applicant has confirmed that, although patients had their treatment initiated due to 
peripheral neuropathy, the subject also had to meet the other criteria including measurable disease 
defined as serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) >0.5 g/dL. For all evaluable patients, efficacy 
evaluation was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VIth International Workshop 
for WM (NCCN 2014), in which IgM is one of the most important factors. 
The medium age for diagnosis of WM is 70 years.  The demographic characteristics of patients in study 
1127 show a median age of 69 years with a median time since diagnosis just above 5 years. The median 
time since diagnosis in the treatment-naïve patients was 6.5 months and 94.3 months for the previously 
treated patients. The median age of patients included in the earlier presented study 1118E, the study 
which efficacy results are compared below, was 63 years.  
An imbalance was seen in the subgroup > 75 years, 40% and 26.7% in the Ibr+R and the Pbo+R, 
respectively. A majority, 78.7 % of the patients had an intermediate or high score according to IPSS for 
WM, which often coincide with a higher grade of disease specific symptoms. However, 50.2% and 42.7% 
of the patients were in ECOG 0 and 1, respectively. Presently, only medically unfit patients are 
recommended rituximab monotherapy, as described in ESMO guidelines. 
The study population, in the randomised part, consisted of both earlier treated and untreated patients, 
and 54,6 % and 54,7% of the patients in the Ibr+R and Pbo+R arm, respectively, had received at least 
1 (median 2) earlier line of treatment. Data on earlier treatments is provided in the attachments. An 
anti-CD20 antibody had been given to 87.8% of the previously treated subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 
85.5% in the Pbo+R arm. Only 70% of the patients in Pbo+R completed the rituximab treatment (4 + 4 
infusions during weeks 1-4 and 17-20) which strikes as an unusually low number (12% withdraw due to 
adverse event and 5.3% withdrawal by subject). The MAH clarified that 4 subjects withdrew their consent 
and 3 subjects were taken off treatment based on investigator decision. Among the 9 subjects in the 
Pbo+R arm who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event as compared with 2 subjects in the 
Ibr+R arm, 7 subjects discontinued rituximab due to infusion-related reactions, while none of the 
subjects in the Ibr+R arm discontinued due to an infusion-related reaction.  
Treatment was initiated in a larger proportion of patients in the control arm (Pbo+R) due to constitutional 
symptom(38.7% vs 25.3%); Hgb < 10 g/dL (100 g/L), (37.3% vs 26.7%), fatigue (65.3 % vs 56 %), 
symptomatic organomegaly and/or organ tissue infiltration (9.3% vs 2.7%), IgM related immune 
haemolytic anemia/trombocytopenia (5.3% vs 0%), platelet count < 100x109 (8.0 5 vs 2.7%). On the 
other hand, more patients in the Ibr+R arm had their treatment initiated, in a larger proportion due to 
peripheral neuropathy (20% vs 10.7%) and serum IgM >5 g/dL (24% vs 16%). Peripheral neuropathy 
due to serum monoclonal protein is a, however clinically significant, heterogeneous group of disorders but 
not always accompanied with other reasons to initiate treatment for WM, hence as reason for initiation of 
therapy, neuropathy is difficult to assess in the context of efficacy assessments and the study endpoints. 
In response to RSI, the applicant has confirmed that, howsoever patients had their treatment initiated du 
to peripheral neuropathy, the subject also had to meet the other criteria including measurable disease 
defined as serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) >0.5 g/dL. For all evaluable patients, efficacy 
evaluation was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VIth International Workshop 
for WM (NCCN 2014), in which IgM is one of the most important factors.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A pre-specified interim analysis for the randomized study was planned for 50 IRC-confirmed PFS events 
and the final analysis was planned for 71 PFS events. This report represents an event-driven analysis, 
with the data extract completed on 17 October 2017. The interim analysis was conducted with 56 PFS 
events representing 79% of the planned total PFS events. 
The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC assessment was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria 
from the VIth International Workshop for WM. The primary endpoint is considered appropriate for both the 
randomised part and the monotherapy arm. 
PFS per IRC assessment showed a statistically significant advantage for Ibr+R as compared with Pbo+R: 
and significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 80% compared with Pbo+R; (HR = 0.202 
[95% CI: 0.107, 0.380], p <0.0001) (Mod2.7.3/Sec2.2.2 and Sec3.2 and Figure 2). The median PFS per 
IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R arm. The 
Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC assessment at 30 months were 81.6% (95% CI: 
70.5, 88.9) in the Ibr+R arm and 27.5% (95% CI: 12.8, 44.4) in the Pbo+R arm. 
The sensitivity analyses support the result in the primary analysis and the treatment effect was consistent 
across the all of pre-specified subgroups. 
PFS data from the 1127 monotherapy substudy is well in line with the result from the randomised part. 
For study 1118 updated efficacy analysis are lacking, however presented data (median follow-up time of 
14.8 months), the median PFS was not reached for either IRC or INV and the 18-month point estimate of 
the PFS rate per IRC assessment was 79.5%. 
The secondary endpoints Response Rate, RR, (PR or better) per IRC and Clinical Response Rate, CRR, (MR 
or better) per IRC, both showed statistically convincing results. CRR, which is of clinical relevance in WM, 
was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm vs. 46.7% for the Pbo+R arm (rate ratio = 2.001 [95% CI: 1.554, 2.576], 
p < 0.0001). In the 1127 open-label monotherapy substudy, the CRR was 87.1% (95% CI: 70.2, 96.4) 
per IRC assessment. The consistency, with results per INV, is acceptable. In Study 1118E, the CRR was 
82.5% (95% CI: 70.9, 90.9) per IRC. 
Furthermore;  
- 
The response rate (PR or better) per IRC assessment was 72.0% for the Ibr+R arm and 71.0% in 
the open-label monotherapy substudy. In Study 1118E, the response rate per IRC assessment 
was 61.9%. 
- 
The CRR (MR or better) per IRC assessment was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm and 87.1% in the 
open-label monotherapy substudy. In Study 1118E, the CRR was 82.5% per IRC assessment. 
-  Median TTnT was not reached for the Ibr+R arm or in the open-label monotherapy substudy. In 
Study 1118E, TTnT was not assessed. 
-  Subjects with baseline Hgb ≤110 g/L had sustained improvement in Hgb in the Ibr+R arm 
(95.5% of subjects), in the Pbo+R arm (56 % of subjects) and in the open-label monotherapy 
study (81.0% of subjects). In Study 1118E, subjects with baseline Hgb ≤110 g/L, 81.6% of 
subjects had sustained improvement in Hgb during the study. 
The 30-month progression free survival rates were 86% versus 33% among patients with the 
MYD88L265P/CXCR4 WT genotype, 80% versus 29% among those with the MYD88 L265P /CXCR4WHIM 
genotype, and 80% versus 21% among those with the MYD88 WT /CXCR4 WT genotype. For subjects with 
MYD88 L265P mutation the HR was 0.191(95% CI: 0.091, 0.402) and for subjects without the MYD88 L265P 
Assessment report

mutation the PFS HRs was 0.214 (95% CI 0.043, 1.076). The PFS HRs were 0.337 (95% CI: 0.120, 
0.948) and 0.165 (95% CI: 0.075, 0.363) for the untreated and previously treated subjects, respectively. 
Tumor flare is a well-known phenomenon in WM treated with monotherapy rituximab. In the present 
study this was seen in 46.7% of the subjects in the Pbo+R arm vs 8% in the experimental arm. The 
definition of tumor flare is a 25% rise in serum Ig-M level compared to baseline. The same rise in IgM level 
is the definition for PD (supported by two IgM serum immunoglobulin quantitation, 4 weeks apart).  At 3 
months already approximately 10% of the subjects in the Pbo+R had an event. Details concerning the 
instructions for the ICR review, to differentiate between IgM flair and true PD, have been presented.   
In terms of the DOR, the median DOR per IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm (range 
[months]: 1.87+, 36.37+) and was 21.2 months for the Pbo+R arm. In the 1127 open-label 
monotherapy substudy, the median DOR per IRC was not reached (range [months]: 2.43, 34.23+) or per 
INV (range [months]: 3.75+, 36.07+). In Study 1118E, the median DOR was not reached per 
assessment by IRC (range [months]: 2.79+, 18.79+) or per INV (range [months]:0.03+, 18.79+).   
Infusion reactions were recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the 
Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 % (see also discussion on clinical safety).  Thus Ibrutinib sees clearly to be 
protective against infusion reactions caused by rituximab. 
In regard to overall survival, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm. There were 4 
deaths in the Ibr+R arm and 6 deaths in the Pbo+R arm. 
With regard to QoL, by week 25, 68.0% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 54.7% of subjects in the Pbo+R 
arm had a ≥ 3 points increase from baseline in the FACIT-Fatigue subscale score: rate ratio = 1.238 (95% 
CI: 0.955, 1.603), p = 0.1059. 
The overall compliance rates for the EQ-5D-5L PRO measures had a ≥ 90% compliance rate at most time 
points administered. The EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale scores and utility scores were similar between 
the treatment arms at baseline and by Week 25, similar proportions of subjects had clinically meaningful 
improvements in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (45.3% Ibr+R and 46.7% Pbo+R, p = 0.8859), and 
utility score (34.7% Ibr+R and 32.0% Pbo+R arm, p = 0.6923).  
Median time on study was 26.5 months in the randomised part, and a maturation level in the 
experimental arm of 18.7 % and 56 % in the control arm for the PFS analysis. For the monotherapy 
substudy arm the median time on study was 34 months. Date of data extraction was 12 Oct 2017. Data 
on PFS2 or corresponding proxy was requested and addressed in the MAH’s response to the LoQ. Other 
concerns have been addressed in the MAH´s responses and updates of the time-dependent outcomes are 
expected at the time of final analysis June 2020. Please see the B/R section for discussions on the 
appropriateness of the comparator and discussion concerning the add-on structure of the experimental 
arm. 
To understand the potential mechanism of resistance, genetic sequencing has been performed using bone 
marrow specimens of subjects in arms A, B, and C with incidence of progress disease (PD) collected at 
week 49, week 97, incidence of PD or suspected PD (sPD), and end of treatment (EOT). Assessment of 
genetic mutation profile by with the primary goal to examine the known ibrutinib resistance associated 
hotspot mutations in BTK (codon C481) and PLCG2 (codons R665, S707, L845) genes is planned and a 
comprehensive analysis using all identified somatic mutations will be performed in next phase. To date, 
18 samples derived from 9 PD patients in arm C have been analysed.  
During the HTA-CHAMP scientific advice 2014, the applicant was recommended to collect PFS2 data. The 
applicant informed that a meaningful assessment of PFS after initiation of subsequent antineoplastic 
treatment (PFS2) could not be made, due to a small number of events. However, the final analysis could 
serve as the basis of an analysis of PFS2. It is estimated that the clinical study report (CSR) for the final 
Assessment report

analysis will be available for submission by the end of June 2020.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A convincing benefit of Ibr+R over that of Pbo+R was demonstrated with respect to the primary endpoint, 
sensitivity analyses and most of the secondary endpoints.  
Together with efficacy data from study 1118, the presented data from the current study 1127, the effect 
of ibrutinib in WM has been further supported. Data are compelling and of clinical relevance.   
The CHMP recommended the MAH that post-approval data on PFS2 or corresponding proxy be provided 
(expected in June 2020). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Individual safety data for ibrutinib from Study 1127 and  integrated safety data from the seven studies 
that presently forms the basis of the currently authorized indications for ibrutinib are presented in 
parallel.  The 7 studies forming the basis of the authorized indications in the ibrutinib European Union 
(EU) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are:  
•  Study PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as 1118E) for WM;  
•  Studies PCYC-1102-CA, PCYC-1112-CA, PCYC-1115-CA, and PCI-32765CLL3001 (hereafter 
referred to as Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, and CLL3001) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  
•  Studies PCYC-1104-CA and PCI-32765MCL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1104 and 
MCL3001) for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).  
The 981 ibrutinib-treated subjects from these 7 pivotal studies are referred to as the “Current Label Pool”. 
Adverse events were coded in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 20.0. Severity of AEs was graded by the investigator according to National Cancer 
Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03.In general, the 
treatment-emergent period was defined as the period from the date of the first dose of study treatment 
(ibrutinib/placebo, rituximab) up to 30 days after the date of the last dose of study treatment or the day 
before initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (including crossover ibrutinib), whichever came 
first.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are those events that occurred or worsened during the 
treatment-emergent period or that were related to the study treatment.

Open label substudy: 
31 subjects with WM refractory to prior rituximab-based therapy were enrolled in the open-label 
monotherapy substudy (Arm C) of 1127 and received treatment with ibrutinib monotherapy. The median 
age was 67.0 years and more subjects were men (64.5%) and the majority of subjects were white 
(83.9%). The subjects had received a median of 4 (range: 1 to 7) prior WM therapies. The median time 
from the last prior treatment to first dose of ibrutinib was 6.1 months. 
At the time of the primary analysis for Study 1127, the median time on study for subjects in the 
open-label monotherapy substudy was 34.4 months, and the median duration of ibrutinib monotherapy 
was 33.1 months. The majority of subjects (n=17, 54.8%) remained on ibrutinib monotherapy at the 
time of primary analysis. The most common reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib monotherapy was 
disease progression.

Table 26: Grade 3 or higher Treatment-emergent adverse events in 5% or more subjects (by 
toxicity grade, System Organ Class and Preferred term (Study 1127 and Current label Pool; 
safety population) 
The overall incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm (60%) was consistent with that for the 
Current Label Pool (63.0%). 
Open label sub-study: 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in 74.2% of subjects. The most common Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥5% of 
subjects) were neutropenia (n=5 [16.1%]), hypertension (n=3 [9.7%]), anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and 
thrombocytopenia (n=2 subjects each [6.5%]). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events over time 
Common TEAEs over time (i.e. ≥10% per period) in the randomised part were studied during drug 
exposure periods of 1 to 90 days, 91 to 180 days, 181 to 270 days and 271 to 365 days.  
In the Ibr+R arm of Study 1127, the number of subjects at risk was relatively stable across the time 
intervals evaluated (from N=75 for Days 1-90 to N=70 for Days 271-365 and N=69 for ≥Days 366), 
median exposure time of approximately 2 years (25.8 months). For several MedDRA SOCs and common 
PTs, there was no suggestion of an increase in prevalence with continued ibrutinib. However, for the 
following common TEAEs (i.e. reported with overall frequency of at least 10%), there was a suggestion of 
an increase in prevalence with continued ibrutinib treatment (i.e. difference of at least 2-fold) between 
Days 1-90 and Days 271-365 with consistently higher or stable rates for each subsequent time period: 
pneumonia (1.3% for Days 1-90; 3.4% for Days 271-365), fatigue (4.5% for Days 1-90; 10.2% for Days 
271-365), pyrexia (3.0% for Days 1-90; 6.8% for Days 271-365), and hypertension (4.5% for Days 
1-90; 11.9% for Days 271-365).

Arm C, Pbo+R, shows that, consistent with higher discontinuation rate and a median treatment exposure 
of 15.5 months reported, the number of subjects at risk declined over time (N=75 for Days 1-90, N=47 
for Days 271-365 and N=42 for ≥Days 366). 
Similarly, the number of subjects at risk for the Current Label Pool declined over time on ibrutinib 
therapy, from N=981 for Days 1-90 to N=713 for Days 271-365 and N=560 for ≥Days 366), consistent 
with the median treatment exposure of 13 months.  
The decline in the number of subjects at risk over time limits interpretation of prevalence rates across the 
specified intervals. In general, however, there were no apparent trends of an increase in prevalence over 
time for any specific common TEAEs in the Current Label Pool, with the exception of hypertension which 
was reported at prevalence rates of 3.4% for Days 1-90 and 7.9% for Days 271-365. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Certain events of potential clinical relevance, included in the EU RMP, were selected based on clinical 
importance, frequency of occurrence, or preclinical observations. A summary of these events in study 
1127 follows below. 
Hemorrhagic events 
Bleeding TEAEs occurred in 50.7% (4.0% Grade 3-4) in the Ibr+R arm, whereof the most common vas 
ecchymosis (10.7%), Epistaxis, increased tendency to bruise, petechiae (9.3% each), contusion (8.0%), 
and traumatic hematoma (5.3%); all were Grade 1 or 2. Major hemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects 
(4.0%): hemoptysis, melena, and purpura (1 subject each); none were fatal. 
Current label pool: Bleeding events 41.4% (3,2% grade 3-4), ecchymosis 3,4%, Epistaxis 8.3, increased 
tendency to bruise 4.2, petechiae 6,8. Contusion 10.5 traumatic hematoma1,5. 2 fatalities (0,3%) 
In the Pbo+R arm bleeding TEAEs occurred in 21.3% of subjects whereof the most common event was 
epistaxis (8.0%); most were Grade 1 or 2. One hemorrhagic TEAE led to placebo discontinuation: 
immune thrombocytopenic purpura (1 subject) (Attachment 3-Table 14.3.1.8.1). Major hemorrhagic 
TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): epistaxis in 1 subject, hematuria in the second subject, and 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage intracranial (Grade 5), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura 
in the third subject. 
Approximately 40% all subjects in the Ibr+R (41.3%) or Pbo+R (36.0%) arms in Study 1127, and 49.5% 
of subjects in the Current Label Pool, used  concomitant anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medication at 
any time during the study treatment period.

Infections 
Table 29: Summary of TEAEs; Infections 
In Study 1127, pneumonia-related TEAEs was reported for 18.7% of subjects in theIbr+R arm (13.3% 
Grade 3 or 4). For the majority of subjects in the Ibr+R arm with a pneumonia-related TEAE, the event 
was serious. No reported pneumonia-related TEAE resulted in a reduction in dose or discontinuation of 
ibrutinib in Study 1127. 
Severe gastrointestinal disorders 
In Study 1127, severe GI TEAEs (Grade 3 or 4) were reported for 2 subjects (2.7%) in the Ibr+R (one 
report each of Grade 3 or 4; constipation and vomiting). Neither of the Grade 3 or 4 GI TEAEs resulted in 
a reduction in the dose of ibrutinib or discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment The Grade 3 or 4 TEAE of 
constipation was serious.  
Two subjects (2.7%) in the Pbo+R arm of Study 1127 had a severe GI TEAE (one report each of Grade 3 
or 4 diarrhea and constipation). Both of these events were serious.

Other Malignancies, Including Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Table 30: Summary of secondary malignancies 
Non-skin cancer TEAEs were reported for 2 subjects (2.7%) in the Ibr+R arm (none in Pbo+R) arm) of 
Study 1127 and consisted of 1 report each of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In the Current Label 
Pool, non-skin cancer TEAEs occurred in 2.5% of ibrutinib-treated subjects, with most of these 
representing single occurrences of a particular cancer type. 
Hypertension 
In the Ibr+R arm, hypertension TEAEs occurred in 18.7.0% of subjects (13.3% Grade 3 or 4). For 1 
subject in this treatment arm (1.3%), the hypertension TEAE was serious (Grade 3 or 4); no subject had 
the dose of ibrutinib reduced or discontinued as a result of a hypertension TEAE. 
In the Pbo+R arm, hypertension TEAEs occurred in 5.3% of subjects (4.0% Grade 3 or 4).  
The reported incidence of hypertension TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm was higher, compared to the Current 
Label Pool (9.9%, with Grade 3 or 4 events 3.8%).  
Few subjects in the Current Label Pool had a hypertension TEAE that was serious (0.6%; all Grade 3 or 4) 
or resulted in ibrutinib dose reduction (0.1%) or ibrutinib discontinuation (0.1%) 
Cardiac Arrhythmias 
•  Atrial fibrillation 
In Study 1127, atrial fibrillation TEAEs occurred in 11 (14.7%) subjects in the Ibr+R arm, and 2 subjects 
(2.7%) in the Pbo+R arm. The majority of the events were manageable without treatment 
discontinuation and 8 of the 14 events were reported as resolved. Three of the 11 subjects in the Ibr+R 
arm with atrial fibrillation discontinued the study drug and led to a reduction of the ibrutinib dose. In 1 
subject in the Pbo+R arm the event was serious, and Grade 3 or 4 in severity.

In the Ibr+R arm, no fatal TEAEs occurred. There were 3 Grade 5 TEAE (death), all in the Pbo+R arm in 
the randomised part of the study (unknown cause, hemorrhage intracranial, and nervous system 
disorder). 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation in the Ibr+R arm were reported for 4 subjects (5.3%): atrial 
fibrillation (3 subjects), interstitial lung disease, and rash macular (1 subject each). 
Rituximab discontinuation was reported for 2 subjects (atrial defibrillation and variant angina, 1 subject 
each). 
In the Pbo+R arm, TEAEs leading to placebo discontinuation were reported for 5 subjects, 6.7% 
(asthenia, 2 subjects and Brugada syndrome, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and night sweats, 1 
subject each). 
TEAEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were reported for 9 subjects, 12.0% (infusion related 
reaction,7 subjects and asthenia and Brugada syndrome (1 subject each).  
No subjects had TEAE of tumor lysis syndrome or leucostasis, in either arm. Neither was any TLS or 
leucostasis seen in the monotherapy substudy. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
Ibrutinib dose reduction was reported for 14 subjects (18.7%) in the Ibr+R arm. Events leading to dose

Safety in special populations  
Of the 1,200 patients treated with ibrutinib in the Overall Label Pool, 64% were 65 years of age or older. 
Grade 3 or higher pneumonia occurred more frequently among elderly patients treated with ibrutinib 
(12% of patients age ≥65 versus 7% of patients <65 years of age).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation rests on a total of 981 patients that constitutes the integrated dataset (= current 
label pool) which includes the 63 WM patients from the pivotal 1118E study. The present variation for 
extended indication in WM adds further 150 patients to the safety evaluation. A total of 213 patients, 
given the rarity of WM, are considered acceptable. 
Apart from the 1127 study, the integrated dataset consists of study 1118E in WM (WM, n=63) of studies 
1102 (CLL/SLL, n=51), 1112 (CLL/SLL, n=195), 1115 (CLL/SLL, n=135) and CLL3001 (CLL/SLL, and 
n=287). Studies MCL3001 (MCL, n=139) and 1104 (MCL, n=111).This is referred to as the Current Label 
Pool.  
The safety population was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of ibrutinib and it should 
be noted that the posology differs between indications i.e. MCL (560 mg/daily) versus CLL/SLL and WM 
(both 420 mg/daily). In addition to the current label pool, safety data from, a presently assessed parallel

procedure, Study 1130 (CLL/SLL) is incorporated, now comprising 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib 
for CLL, WM, or MCL, constitutes the Overall Label Pool.  
The median duration of exposure to ibrutinib in the 1127 study was 26 months (median average dos of 
411 mg/day) compared to 13 months in the current label pool (median average dos of 416 mg/day). The 
study also includes time-truncated data. 
All patients in the 1127 study had at least one TEAE. In the Ibr+R arm a high incidence reported for 
various SOCs (e.g. gastrointestinal disorder; 59%, infections/infestations; 69%, general disorder; 56%, 
blood and lymphatic system disorder; 45%, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder; 52%, respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal system disorder; 39%, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder; 53%, 
nervous system disorders; 40%).  About 60 % of the patients in the 1127 study reported any Grade 3 or 
4 event (both arms). 
Frequency of infusion related reactions to rituximab were observed in a considerably lower rate in the 
Ibr+R arm versus the Pbo+R arm. 
In the 1127 study, there were 3 Grade 5 TEAE (death), all in the Pbo+R arm in the randomised part of the 
study (1 unknown cause, 1 hemorrhage intracranial, and 1 nervous system disorder). 
The safety profile of the 1127 study was largely consistent with the current label pool, with the exception 
of hypertension (13 % vs 3 % in the Ibr+R arm and current label pool, respectively) and atrial fibrillation 
(12% vs 3 %, Ibr+R arm and current label pool, respectively). The time-truncated data showed an 
increased prevalence of hypertension, by time of exposure to ibrutinib. This however, was not the case for 
atrial fibrillation. An increased frequency was also seen for arthralgia which occurred in a more than 
doubled rate in Ibr+R arm compared to both the Pbo+R arm and the current label pool (24% vs 11% and 
12%) and was not reported to be time dependent.  
In the Ibr+R arm, no fatal TEAEs occurred, however, but in the Pbo+R arm, fatal TEAEs occurred in 3 
subjects (4.0%): death (unknown cause), intracranial haemorrhage, and nervous system disorder. The 
reported figure from the current label pool was 7 %. In all there were 10 deaths reported (4 vs 6 Ibr+R 
arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively.  
TEAEs lead to discontinuation of study drug in 5.3 % and 6.7 % in the Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R arm, 
respectively. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were reported for 2 subjects 
in the Ibr+R arm. The rate of discontinuation of study drug in the current label pool was 11.4 %. Dose 
reduction was seen in 18.7 % in the Ibr+R arm (mainly neutropenia, atrial fibrillation and muscle 
spasms). In the current label pool fewer subjects had a dose reduction, 11.4%.  No subjects in Pbo+R arm 
had any dose reduction due to TEAE.  
TEAE grade ≥ 3 occurred in 60 % vs 61 % in the Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively and 70 % 
in the current label pool. The most common TEAEs grade ≥ 3 were infections and blood and lymphatic 
disorder. Any serious TEAE grade > 3 occurred in 38.7 % and 29.3%, in the Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R 
arm, respectively, while this was seen in 42% in the current label pool. One of the TEAEs of clinical 
interest concerns bleeding; in the Ibr+R arm, TEAEs occurred in 50.7%, the most common events (≥ 5 % 
of subjects) were ecchymosis (10.7%), epistaxis, increased tendency to bruise, petechiae (9.3% each). 
Major haemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): hemoptysis, melena, and purpura (1 subject 
each); none were fatal. The proportion of subjects with a haemorrhage TEAE of any grade/severity or with 
a major haemorrhagic TEAE in the Ibr+R arm of Study 1127 were consistent with those observed in the 
Current Label Pool. Bleeding TEAEs in the Pbo+R arm occurred in 21.3% of subjects; the most common 
event (≥ 5% of subjects) were epistaxis (8.0%); most were Grade 1 or 2.  
Infusion reactions was recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the 
Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 %.

Infections were among the most common events in the Ibr+R arm, reported in 69.3% of subjects (22.7% 
Grade 3 or 4). In Study 1127, there were no events of Aspergillus infections in the Ibr+R arm, there was 
a single case of Aspergillus infection in the open-label substudy of ibrutinib monotherapy. 
Infection-related TEAEs were reported at a lower rate in the Pbo+R arm (41.3% any grade; 8.0% Grade 
3-4; 5.3% serious) than in the Ibr+R arm in Study 1127. In the current label pool, frequencies observed 
for ibrutinib-treated subjects of infection TEAEs of any grade, Grade 3 or 4, or serious events, was 
consistent with Ibr+R arm of Study 1127. 
The incidence of severe GI TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm was lower than that for the Current Label Pool (8.7% 
Grade 3 or 4; 0.2% Grade 5) but resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation for only a small minority (n=7, 
0.7%). Diarrhea (3.2%) and abdominal pain (2.0%) were the most frequent severe (and serious) GI 
TEAEs in the Current Label Pool. 
The increased prevalence in hypertension observed in Ibr+R might be a consequence from longer time on 
treatment. However, there was no increase in prevalence over time observed for atrial fibrillation. There 
was a doubled rate of TEAE atrial fibrillation in the Ibr+R arm (any grade 14.7%, Grade 3 or higher: 
13.3%) compared to the current label pool (any grade 6.4%, Gr 3 or higher: 3.4%). 
Atrial fibrillation TEAEs in the Current Label Pool generally did not result in dose reduction or 
discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment (0.1% and 0.7% subjects respectively) and were not serious for the 
majority of subjects (3.1% of subjects had serious atrial fibrillation).  
Similar frequencies of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs (excluding atrial fibrillation) was reported in both arms of 
study 1127 (Ibr+R arm: 10.7% and Pbo+R 9.3%). The pattern of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs in the Ibr+R 
arm was consistent with that observed for ibrutinib-treated subjects in the Current Label Pool. In the 
Current Label Pool, the frequency of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs (excluding atrial fibrillation) of any grade 
was 10.1%. 
One subject experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE in the Ibr+R arm (Grade 1 ventricular extra 
systoles), this did not result in ibrutinib dose reduction or discontinuation. Two subjects (2.7%) in the 
Pbo+R arm of Study 1127 had a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE. The occurrence of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia TEAEs in subjects in the Ibr+R in Study 1127 was consistent with the pattern of these 
events in the Current Label Pool, where 1.0% of subjects had a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE, most 
of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
No change in Other Malignancy frequency or pattern is seen, due to low and constant frequency, in 1127 
compared to the current label pool. Treatment-emergent AEs of tumor flare were excluded from the other 
malignancy summaries, as these events were assessed separately. Tumor flare, associated with the 
usage of rituximab in WM, and which in WM only counts for a temporary, treatment evoked, increase 
serum IgM level, was decreased in the Ibr+R arm compared to the Pbo+R arm: 8.0% vs. 46.7%, 
respectively. 
Of the 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib for CLL, WM, or MCL comprising the Overall Label Pool, 5.1% 
discontinued treatment primarily due to ADRs. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhage, 
and thrombocytopenia. Adverse drug reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 6.6% of the 1,200 
subjects.  
Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for 
ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved 
SmPC.  Warnings regarding hypertension have been included in section 4.4 to recommend regular 
monitoring of blood pressure in patients treated with Imbruvica and initiation or adjustment of

antihypertensive medication throughout treatment as appropriate. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with WM is overall consistent with what is already known in 
ibrutinib treated patients with CLL/SLL and MCL. No new safety signal has been seen. A higher frequency 
of hypertension was noted and also seen to increase in a time-on treatment-dependent way. The SmPC 
has been updated accordingly.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) in 
combination with rituximab. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, only a minority of patients are offered monotherapy rituximab for the treatment of WM 
according to a recent large retrospective chart review (Lancet Haematol 2018, C Buske et al). Data from 
Medicare claims linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, which evaluated 
changes in the presentation, management, and survival among 2,666 Medicare beneficiaries, diagnosed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644926/2019

with WM between 1994 and 2011 in the US – show that rituximab monotherapy was prescribed for >50% 
of patients since 2004, and combination CIT for a further 30%. Based on input from the WM Consortium 
Group and a Joint CHMP-HTA Scientific Advice in 2014 regarding the design of Study 1127, the 
importance of a treatment of WM to move toward to a chemotherapy-free regimen, to control the disease 
and improve quality of life, is underlined.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 1127 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study with the aim to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab versus rituximab alone in 
subjects 18 years of age or older with untreated or previously treated WM. In addition, an open-label 
substudy (Treatment Arm C) was included to further investigate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib as a 
monotherapy in adult subjects with WM who were considered refractory to the last prior 
rituximab-containing therapy.  
A total of 150 subjects were included in the randomised part (75 patients in each arm) and 31 subjects 
were included in the monotherapy sub-study. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the 
experimental arm, Ibr+R, compared to placebo Pbo+R, in subjects with WM. The study design was 
developed considering the scientific advice from regulatory agencies, including CHMP in 2014. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint with an improvement of median PFS (IRC assessed). Median PFS was 
not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R arm (HR = 0.202 (95% CI: 0.107, 
0.380), p < 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate at 30 months were 82 % for the 
Ibr+R arm and 28 % for the Pbo+R arm.  
The sensitivity analyses performed on PFS supports the result in the primary analysis and the treatment 
effect was consistent across the pre-specified subgroups. The benefit in the Ibr+R group over that in the 
Pbo+R group was independent of the MYD88 or CXCR4 genotype. The secondary endpoint, RR (≥ PR) per 
IRC assessment was significantly higher for the Ibr+R arm than the Pbo+R arm: 72.0% Ibr+R vs. 32.0% 
Pbo+R, rate ratio = 2.299 (95% CI: 1.592; 3.319), p < 0.0001. In terms of TTnT, median TTnT showed 
a statistically significant advantage for the Ibr+R arm; it was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and it was 
18.1 months (95% CI: 11.1, NE) for the Pbo+R arm, HR = 0.096 (95% CI: 0.040, 0.227), p < 0.0001. At 
the 30-month landmark time point an estimated 91.5% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 41.4% of 
subjects in the Pbo+R arm had not received subsequent treatment.  Any subsequent antineoplastic 
therapy was received by 6 subjects (8.0%) in the Ibr+R arm and 41 subjects (54.7%) in the Pbo+R arm, 
of which 30 subjects received ibrutinib as crossover therapy. The median OS was not reached for either 
treatment arm. There were 4 deaths in the Ibr+R arm and 6 deaths in the Pbo+R arm. In terms of HQoL/ 
EQ-5D-5L PRO results compliance was high (≥ 90%) and showed similar results for patients in both arms 
for whom data was available.  
Study 1127 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with Ibr+R treatment compared with 
Pbo+R when evaluating sustained Hgb improvement for subjects with untreated or previously treated 
WM. A substantial improvement of Hgb was also seen in the monotherapy substudy arm. In study 1118E 
the Hgb improvement was lower than seen in the single arm substudy of 1127. 
In terms of clinical response rate (≥ MR), the rate was comparable between the two monotherapy arms 
(substudy 1127 and 1118E) and Ibr+R, 87 %, 83 % and 92 % respectively. 
Infusion reactions was recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the 
Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 %. Thus Ibrutinib sees clearly to be protective against infusion reactions 
Assessment report

caused by rituximab. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It was also clarified that the time point for data cut-off was the same as the extraction of data, i.e. 12 Oct 
2017. The maturation of PFS data presently presented is, in the Pbo+R arm 56 % versus 18.7 % in the 
Ibr+R. Updated efficacy results and PFS2 data will, according to the applicant, be presented at the time 
of the final analysis of study 1127, which is planned to take place by the end of June 2020. At this time, 
it will be possible to evaluate possible impaired effect on response to CIT (next line of therapy) upon 
progression on ibrutinib treatment. 
The role of rituximab is unclear in the combination arm, since the isolation of ibrutinib and the potential 
effect of adding rituximab is impossible to disentangle in the presented data. Cross study comparisons 
with previous monotherapy study 1118E and the ibrutinib monotherapy substudy in the present study 
1127, are not indicative of additive effect. However, rituximab it is a well-recognized treatment option 
due to its established monotherapy activity as well as a synergistic effect when combined with 
chemotherapy. Therefor the add-on strategy is deemed acceptable, from a regulatory perspective.    
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall tolerability of ibrutinib given in combination with rituximab is consistent with its known safety 
profile. Safety data from study 1127 is also put in the context of the Current label pool for ibrutinib, 
consisting of 981 subjects (both monotherapy and various combination treatment data). 
In summary, the most common adverse events of any grade with ibrutinib-rituximab included 
infusion-related reactions, diarrhea, arthralgia, and nausea. Events of grade ≥ 3 that occurred more 
frequently with ibrutinib-rituximab than with placebo-rituximab included atrial fibrillation (12% vs. 1%) 
and hypertension (13% vs. 4%); those that occurred less frequently included infusion reactions (1% vs. 
16%) and any grade of IgM flare (8% vs. 47%). The major hemorrhage rate was the same in the two trial 
groups (4%). Hypertension was observed to increase in prevalence with time on continued ibrutinib 
treatment, which is reflected in the PI ; hypertension is an important identified risk of ibrutinib and the 
RMP was updated accordingly. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no uncertainties in the assessment of safety.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based on the findings in a Phase 2 study in WM, 1118E, ibrutinib monotherapy has shown clinically 
relevant benefit in WM subjects who had failed prior CD20 therapy (either alone or in combination with 
other agents). This supported a second line indication in WM, also including those patients being unfit for 
CIT as first line therapy. The results from the randomized part of, Study 1127 with a median time on study 
of 26.5 months (both arms) demonstrate that treatment with combination of Ibr+R results in clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement of PFS, response rates, DOR and sustained Hgb 
improvements compared with Pbo+R treatment. This was shown in subjects that were both 
treatment-naïve and previously treated WM.  
The results also demonstrate a significantly longer time to next line of WM therapy (TTnT) as well as lower 
rates of infusion reactions in the Ibr+R-treated subjects compared with Pbo+R-treated subjects. The 
treatment effect of Ibr+R on PFS was robust and consistent across all predefined subgroups. 
For the 1127 open-label monotherapy substudy (Treatment Arm C), enrolling only subjects considered 
refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy, the efficacy results (after a median time on 
study of 34.4 months) for PFS, response rates and sustained Hgb improvements, further confirm the 
efficacy of single agent ibrutinib, as previously observed in Study 1118E, for the treatment of WM. 
No new safety signals were observed; the majority of the TEAE rates are essentially consistent with the 
known safety profile in the current label pool. In summary, the safety profile for ibrutinib is in large 
consistent with its known safety profile. The risks known to be associated with the use of ibrutinib (e.g. 
hemorrhage, neutropenia, infections, arthralgia) are manageable through medical management with 
routine clinical assessment. This also accounts for the known TEAEs like atrial fibrillation and 
hypertension. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Data from the primary analysis from the study 1127 in WM, showed superiority on PFS of the combination 
of Ibr+R over Pbo+R, in treatment-naïve and previously treated patients WM. Furthermore, the results 
from the ibrutinib monotherapy substudy in rituximab-refractory patients indicate a treatment effect 
comparable to the results in the ibrutinib-containing arm in the randomised study. Furthermore, Study 
1127 investigated the “add on” of ibrutinib or placebo to rituximab in a population with both 
treatment-naïve patients and previously treated patients.   
The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib + rituximab vs ibrutinib 
monotherapy in the broad indication WM. 
In order to better understand the ibrutinib resistance, there is need of PFS2 data or a corresponding proxy 
such as time to second subsequent therapy. The MAH will provide final results in June 2020 were also 
PFS2 data will be presented (see RMP).  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imbruvica in the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia 
(WM) in combination with rituximab is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one 
Extension of Indication to include treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia 
(WM) in combination with rituximab; as a consequence, section 4.1 and 4.8 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An 
updated RMP (version 12) was agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module  
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

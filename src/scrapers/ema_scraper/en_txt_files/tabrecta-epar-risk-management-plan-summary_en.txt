Summary of the risk management plan for Tabrecta
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Tabrecta®.  The  RMP 
details important risks of Tabrecta™, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more information will be obtained about Tabrecta’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Tabrecta's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) gives essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Tabrecta should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Tabrecta  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Tabrecta®’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Tabrecta® is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  with  a  MET  exon  14  skipping 
mutation.  It  contains  capmatinib  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by  oral 
administration  with  or  without  food,  as  film-coated  tablets  at  a  dose  of  400 mg 
b.i.d.
Further information about the evaluation of Tabrecta®’s benefits can be found in 
Tabrecta® EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tabrecta
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Tabrecta®, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Tabrecta's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack sizes - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Tabrecta® is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Tabrecta® are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of 
Tabrecta®.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an  association  with  the  use  of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal  product that  is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Hepatotoxicity grouped events have been reported during 
treatment with capmatinib and therefore, hepatic function 
should be closely monitored.
In preclinical studies: Slight changes in serum liver enzymes 
(ALT, AST, and/or SDH) were observed in several different 
studies in rats and monkeys. These changes were restricted 
to highly variable, minimal-to-mild elevations lacking a clear 
dose response. These liver enzyme elevations were mostly 
observed in the absence of any histological correlate within 
the liver, with the exception of a 13-week monkey study, 
which showed a reversible, minimal-to-mild subcapsular 
neutrophilic infiltration associated with single cell necrosis in 
males at 75 mg/kg/day.
There are no identified risk factors for the occurrence of 
hepatotoxicity in capmatinib-treated patients.
Common general causative/ risk factors for hepatotoxicity 
include:
-Elderly patients are at increased risk of hepatic injury due to 
reduced blood flow to the liver, DDIs, and decreased drug 
clearance
-Alcohol abuse in patients with cirrhotic liver changes
-Concomitant use of hepatotoxic medications
-Other concurrent liver illness such as hepatitis
-Patient who have liver involvement of the malignancy, e.g. 
liver cancer (HCC) and liver metastasis.

Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis has been reported 
during treatment with capmatinib and therefore, should be 
closely monitored.

Amylase and lipase increases have been reported during 
treatment with capmatinib in clinical studies and therefore, 
should be closely monitored.
In preclinical studies: Reversible findings in the pancreas 
were observed in rats and monkeys in 28-day and 13-week 
studies, including pancreatic acinar cell vacuolation and/or 
apoptosis without inflammation, occasionally accompanied by 
increased amylase or lipase. In rats, the doses of 60 
mg/kg/day or higher in males and 30 mg/kg/day or higher in 
females showed reversible low-grade pancreatic changes in 
28-day and/or 13-week studies. In monkeys, pancreatic 
findings included reversible low-grade acinar cell apoptosis in 
all groups with higher serum amylase at the high dose of 150 
mg/kg/day in the 28-day study, and increases in amylase 
and lipase in a small number of animals at 75 mg/kg/day in 
the 13-week study.
There are no identified risk factors for the occurrence of 
increased amylase/lipase in capmatinib-treated patients.
-Common causative /risk factors include:
-Alcohol (more common in men)
-Gallstones, esp. microlithiasis (more common in women)
-Autoimmune diseases
-Blockage of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct
-Damage to the ducts or pancreas during surgery
-Hypertriglyceridemia
-Injury to the pancreas from accident

Increase in the blood creatinine levels have been observed in 
patients receiving capmatinib in the clinical studies.
In preclinical studies: Histopathologic changes were observed 
in the kidneys in a 28-day monkey study where mild-to-
moderate deposits of amphophilic, crystalline-like material 
surrounded by multinucleated giant cells within the renal 
interstitium and/or tubular lumen were present at a dose of 
75 mg/kg/day and higher. However, in a 13-week monkey 
study, renal precipitates or kidney toxicity was not observed 
at any doses tested (up to 75 mg/kg/day). Follow-up 
investigations on the identity of the crystalline-like material 
indicated that the material is not capmatinib or its 
metabolites, but rather calcium phosphate precipitates.
There are no identified risk factors for the occurrence of 
increased creatinine in capmatinib-treated patients.
Common causative/ risk factors for increased creatinine 
include:
-Pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, 
hypertension and heart disease
-Concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications.
-Patient who has disease progression e.g. kidney metastasis
-Inadequate fluid intake due to nausea, vomiting and fasting 
state

In pre-clinical studies; In vitro and in vivo photosensitization 
assays with capmatinib suggested that capmatinib has the 
potential for photosensitization. The NOAEL for in vivo 
photosensitization is 30 mg/kg/day (Cmax of 14000 ng/mL, 
approximately 2.9X human Cmax at 400 mg b.i.d tablet 
dose).
There have been no identified risk factors for the occurrence 
of photosensitivity in patients treated with capmatinib.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a very rare and life-threatening disease in which 
uncontrolled complement activation leads to systemic complications, principally through intravascular 
haemolysis and thrombophilia.  
PNH can occur at any age, although it is diagnosed most often during young adulthood, with diagnosis 
typically occurring in the 30s or 40s. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The prevalence of PNH is estimated at 15.9 cases per million individuals in Europe and occurs more 
frequently in Asia than in western countries.   
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is caused by a somatic mutation of the phosphatidylinositol glycan 
A (PIG-A) gene, located in the X-chromosome, that leads to a lack of CD55 and CD59, which are key, 
naturally occurring terminal complement inhibitor proteins on cell surfaces. The absence of these 
complement inhibitor proteins on the cell surface results in continuous activation of the alternative 
complement pathway and chronic intravascular haemolysis. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
PNH can present with multi-systemic manifestations related to chronic intravascular haemolysis, 
impaired bone marrow function, and thrombosis. The common clinical manifestations of PNH are 
haemolytic anaemia, venous thrombosis and deficient haematopoiesis. Excessive levels of cell-free 
plasma haemoglobin during intravascular haemolysis contribute to platelet activation, procoagulant 
activity and thromboembolism, the leading cause of mortality in these patients. Chronic severe anemia 
also frequently develops. Red blood counts are normochromic and normocytic unless iron deficiency has 
occurred from chronic iron loss in the urine. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are common and 
reflect deficient haematopoiesis. Clinical haemoglobinuria is intermittent in most patients and never 
occurs in some, but haemosidenuria is usually present.  
Thromboembolic events are the leading cause of death in patients with PNH, and pulmonary hypertension 
and end-organ damage of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, brain, and intestines, are sequelae of 
thromboembolic events. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The only approved drug for PNH, eculizumab (Soliris), was approved in 2007 in the EU. Eculizumab is a 
selective, humanized mAb that specifically targets C5 of the terminal complement cascade, inhibiting its 
cleavage during complement activation into C5a and C5b. Prior to the introduction of eculizumab (Soliris), 
the treatment of PNH was mainly supportive, aiming to control the clinical manifestations of the disease 
(management of haemolysis, anaemia, thrombophilia, and bone marrow failure). This supportive 
treatment included blood transfusion, administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, 
corticosteroids, or anabolic steroids, iron therapy, thrombosis prophylaxis, and thrombolytic therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 9/128 
 
 
 
The only available curative approach for PNH is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT). However, allogeneic HSCT is associated with high mortality and morbidity. 
About the product 
Ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody IgG2/4K that specifically binds to the complement protein C5, 
thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating subunit 
of the terminal complement complex [C5b-9]) and preventing the generation of the C5b-9. By binding 
specifically to C5, ravulizumab antagonizes terminal complement-mediated inflammation, cell activation, 
and cell lysis while preserving the early components of complement pathway activation that are essential 
for opsonization of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 300 mg of 
ravulizumab as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium 
chloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in a vial (Type I glass) with a stopper and a seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance (INN: ravulizumab) is a recombinant humanized IgG2/4 monoclonal antibody 
consisting of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains (human kappa) linked by disulfide 
bonds. Ravulizumab binds to complement component 5 (C5) and blocks its activation by complement 
pathway convertases, thereby preventing the release of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a and the 
formation of the terminal complement complex via C5b. 
Ravulizumab was constructed by introducing four unique mutations into the heavy chain of eculizumab. 
Taken together these mutations are predicted to significantly increase the dissociation of ravulizumab:C5 
complexes to free ravulizumab in the acidified environment of the early endosome after pinocytosis and 
to increase the fraction of free ravulizumab recycled from the early endosome back into the vascular 
compartment by FcRn. Thus, the antibody half-life is increased, allowing administration (in the 
maintenance phase) once every 8 weeks, compared to every 2 weeks for eculizumab. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Ravulizumab active substance is produced at two manufacturing sites: FUJIFILM Diosynth 
Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. (FDBU) and Patheon Biologics LLC (Patheon).  
During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to several GMP issues (missing/outdated 
documentation and lack of EU batch release site). Updated GMP certificates for the sites involved in the 
manufacturing process were requested. In response, the applicant provided updated GMP certificates or 
evidence of positive GMP status issued by US FDA for the sites in question. In addition, new sites were 
introduced to fulfil the requirement for batch control testing to be conducted in the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 10/128 
 
 
 
 
Ravulizumab is manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at the bioreactor scale. The 
production starts with a single vial of the Working Cell Bank (WCB) and cultures are progressively 
expanded using growth medium through a series of cell culture steps. The cell culture and harvesting 
process comprises of three discrete steps (inoculum expansion, cell culture in production bioreactor, and 
primary recovery). Upon completion of the cell culture, cells and cell debris are removed. The clarified 
harvest is filtered prior to purification. There are some differences in the batch definition in the two 
manufacturing sites although the batch size is the same in the two manufacturing sites.  
The purification process is designed to purify ravulizumab by removal of process and product related 
impurities from the clarified harvest using orthogonal purification steps, followed by concentration and 
formulation into bulk drug substance (BDS). It includes a series of chromatography steps and virus 
inactivation and removal steps.  
Flow diagrams and Tables showing the manufacturing steps and the critical (CPP) and key process 
parameters (KPP), in process controls (IPC) and key process attributes (KPA) for each manufacturing step 
in the two facilities are provided in the dossier. A KPP is defined as a process parameter that should be 
controlled within a defined range and is essential for process performance. A KPP affects KPAs but does 
not affect product quality attributes. A non-key process parameter (NKPP) is a process parameter that 
has been demonstrated to be well controlled or has a wide acceptance limit. 
Processes at FDBU and Patheon are not identical, but differ as follows: 
• 
• 
Inoculum step differences. 
The CPP, KPP, IPC and KPA established and their acceptance criteria are not always the same at 
the two sites.  
•  Differences in the timing and acceptance limits of the bioburden and endotoxin controls. 
•  Differences in hold times. 
•  Chromatography step differences.  
The applicant was requested to justify if the differences in the parameters and acceptance criteria that 
have been established in the two manufacturing sites are equally effective in the control of the 
manufacturing processes. The applicant was also requested to explain if the differences in acceptance 
limits for bioburden and endotoxin are not compromising the control of these two parameters in the two 
manufacturing sites. The applicant clarified that the differences between Patheon and FDBU are due to 
facility specific risk assessments and alignment with site policies/definitions. Further justifications were 
provided by the applicant in relation to the bioburden and endotoxin control and these were found 
acceptable. 
It was also demonstrated in comparability studies that the production of ravulizumab is equally effective 
at both sites.   
Control of Materials 
The applicant has described all the raw materials used in the manufacture of ravulizumab, the quality of 
each component and the supplier quality management system. Critical raw materials have been identified 
and the specification of those raw materials has been provided. No biological sourced materials are used 
in the manufacturing process other than the CHO cell line, and one media component. The applicant has 
performed a risk assessment in relation to the media component concluding that the viral safety is 
assured. This is endorsed.  
The applicant has thoroughly described the development genetics, the gene construct and the rationale 
for the gene construct. A two tiered cell banking system has been established with a master cell bank 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 11/128 
 
 
 
(MCB) and a working cell bank. Extensive characterisation of the MCB, WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro 
cell age (LIVCA) has been performed in compliance with ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D. Clonality and genetic 
stability of the production cell line is demonstrated by several methods. All tests were performed 
according to current guidelines, and all the results obtained ensure that both cell banks meet all required 
specifications. 
The applicant has presented their strategy for a continuous supply of the bank cells including a protocol 
for introducing new working cell banks, and has confirmed that the master cell bank is stored at two 
remote sites to ensure continuous and interrupted production of biopharmaceuticals  
Process validation 
Manufacturing process validation studies performed at FDBU and at Patheon are provided. For validation 
of the FDBU process, the studies were performed on an adequate number of active substance batches. 
The process validation studies for Patheon process were also performed on an adequate number of active 
substance batches. For validation studies, samples were taken to monitor the critical process parameters 
(CPP), key process parameters (KPP) and key process attributes (KPA). KPAs were monitored to 
demonstrate consistency of the process. Bioburden and endotoxin samples were taken to demonstrate 
microbial control of the process. 
All the steps of cell culture, harvest and purification have been validated. The results showed that all the 
steps perform in a consistent, controlled, and reproducible manner.  
Reprocessing is proposed for two filtration steps. Validations of these reprocessing steps have been 
performed. The studies performed showed that, in both cases, there is no impact in process performance 
or product quality after refiltration.  
Studies were performed at FDBU and at Patheon to determine the ability of selected steps in the 
manufacturing processes to remove process related impurities. The data from these studies showed the 
reduction in impurities throughout the active substance manufacturing process. Based on the results, the 
applicant proposes the discontinuation of in-process testing for some impurities as well as discontinuation 
of release testing for some others. This proposal is found acceptable. 
Studies were performed to determine the ability of selected steps in the ravulizumab manufacturing 
processes to remove product related impurities. This was done by measuring levels of selected impurities 
in samples collected from the process intermediate steps. The studies were performed on three at-scale 
batches at FDBU and three at Patheon. The results showed that the product related impurities are 
consistent and at low levels. They will be monitored at active substance release. 
Resin re-use studies support the proposed resin re-use limits.  
A membrane re-use protocol is provided in the dossier to determine the final re-use limit.  
The steps in the manufacturing process where process hold times occur were validated at scale. The 
results showed that these process intermediate pools can be held out to the maximum times indicated 
without adversely impacting the biochemical/biophysical stability or microbiological integrity of the pools. 
The applicant commits to provide at scale biochemical stability data post-approval. 
A shipping validation study was performed that confirm the ability of the shipping containers to maintain 
the correct temperature during shipment of the active substance. 
Manufacturing process development 
 The initial manufacturing process (Process A) was optimized and scaled up to prepare for advanced 
clinical development and demand (Process B).  In anticipation of commercialization, the manufacturing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 12/128 
 
 
 
process was transferred and scaled up and validated as the commercial process. Additional changes to the 
process were made to improve impurity clearance. 
Studies supporting the changes made to Process B manufacturing process throughout clinical 
manufacturing process were performed and are presented in the dossier. 
A quality target profile for ravulizumab has been developed defining the characteristics of a product that 
ideally will be achieved to ensure the desired quality, taking into account safety and efficacy of the 
finished product. Certain attributes such as those for composition, strength, appearance and adventitious 
agents were designated as mandatory CQA due to their high criticality to product efficacy, safety or 
regulatory considerations. For all other attributes, a risk assessment in accordance with ICH Q9 Quality 
Risk Management was completed to classify the attributes of ravulizumab in relation to the potential to 
affect biological activity, PK, immunogenicity and safety. A composite risk score was calculated by 
multiplying the highest impact score to the attribute by the uncertainty score. Those which have been 
found to have an impact have been designated as CQA.  
A process control strategy for the active substance has been developed to ensure the robust manufacture 
and ensure consistent product quality.  
The risk assessment output supported determination of whether multivariate or univariate Design of 
Experiment (DOE) studies were required, or if no study was required. From these studies, an impact ratio 
(threshold value for parameter classification) was calculated. 
The impact ratio provides a measure of the amount of risk associated with a process parameter, 
exceeding a set threshold for which increases the likelihood of the product not meeting pre-established 
acceptable limits of process performance attributes and CQAs.  
The applicant indicates that upon transfer to each manufacturing site, the parameter classification was 
reevaluated and in some cases refined based on facility specific risk assessments (e.g. FMEA, criticality 
assessment) and to align with site policy/definitions.  
Process characterisation studies of all the manufacturing steps at small scale are presented in the dossier.  
A comprehensive comparability evaluation has been completed to demonstrate that active substance 
batches manufactured at all sites and scales throughout development are comparable to the active 
substance manufactured by the validated processes. Due to limited inventory of the clinical active 
substance at the time of the study, in some cases, corresponding finished product material was used. 
Since the finished product is filled into glass vials with no further formulation, there is no expected impact 
on the comparability evaluation. This evaluation included an extensive battery of comprehensive and 
orthogonal tests that encompass product release and characterisation tests including head-to-head 
testing wherever appropriate of clinical batches compared to three batches manufactured by the 
validated manufacturing processes.  
Comparability also included forced degradation studies confirming that the rate and severity of 
degradation of the material was comparable. The comparability evaluation concluded that the clinical 
active substance is comparable to the material produced by the validated commercial manufacturing 
processes. 
Characterisation 
Physicochemical properties and biological properties of ravulizumab were characterised with a series of 
orthogonal techniques using the reference standard.  
The expected amino acid sequence has been confirmed and the molecular mass analysis results are in 
conformity to the theoretically calculated figures. The charge profile was analysed.  As the hinge region of 
ravulizumab is consistent with the IgG2 isotype, the disulphide bond isoforms have been analysed and a

profile resembling known IgG2 monoclonal antibodies has been recorded. The far and near UV circular 
dichroism spectra are similar to those of other IgG2 monoclonal antibodies. Thermal transitions were 
examined by differential scanning calorimetry at pH 7.0 (formulation buffer).  
The consensus glycolysation site was identified and glycans have been thoroughly analysed. The 
predominant oligosaccharide is a fucosylated biantennary structure without terminal galactose. The 
extent of sialylation was found to be very low and no N-glycolyl neuraminic acid was detected.  
Regarding biological activity, the pH-dependent binding kinetics of ravulizumab to C5 have been 
explored, and the inhibition of human complement haemolytic activity by the active substance has been 
demonstrated. Kinetics of FcRn binding of ravulizumab at pH 6.0 was examined, and binding was 
confirmed by an orthogonal method.  
The impurities of ravulizumab active substance have been sufficiently characterised. Impurities were 
classified as process-related impurities and product-related impurities (charge variants and aggregates). 
Based on available data, the applicant concluded that routine testing for any of the process additives was 
not necessary.   
Concerning product related impurities, the aggregate fraction was found to consist of dimers. Charge 
variants were analysed. Isolated fractions were examined.   
Overall, the description of ravulizumab characterisation is adequate. 
Specification 
The release and stability specification for the active substance includes tests for appearance, osmolality, 
pH, protein concentration, identity, purity/impurities, potency, bioburden and endotoxin. 
Specifications were based in historical batch data and in the analysis of the release data using a mean 
evaluation for the prediction of commercial specifications. However with this adjustment some 
specifications are broader that expected from the data obtained in batch release of batches used for 
clinical studies. The applicant agreed during the procedure to tighten some of the limits and for others the 
applicant made a commitment to review the limit once further commercial scale batches have been 
manufactured. 
Analytical methods 
In general, the analytical procedure descriptions are appropriate and the methods are adecuately 
validated or qualified.  
Batch analysis 
An analysis of the consistency of release and characterisation data generated for active substance 
batches manufactured during clinical development through process validation indicates that the process 
performance qualification batches are consistent to historical ravulizumab batches. 
Reference Standards 
During the development three ravulizumab reference standards have been generated, interim reference 
standard 1 and 2 and the current reference standard. Release testing and extended characterisation has 
been performed for all the reference standards. The initial reference standard was qualified using batch 
release testing and characterisation data. Bridging studies have been performed for the qualification of 
subsequent reference standards, including batch release testing and extended characterisation 
The applicant has submitted the qualification and stability protocol for future reference standards. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised regarding the storage of the reference standard at 
2-8ºC and the lack of assurance that the potency of the reference standard is maintained under these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019

storage conditions. In response, the applicant provided further evidence of the stability of the reference 
standard. In addition, the acceptance criteria of the re-qualification protocol were tightened and the 
shelf-life of the current reference standard was shortened. The applicant also committed to implement a 
2-tier reference standard program to include frozen storage of a primary reference standard to minimize 
loss of potency.  
Stability 
The stability studies proposed and performed on the active substance for the control of changes in 
identity, purity and potency are considered in general appropriate. Pre-clinical, engineering and clinical 
batches produced by different manufacturing processes (A and B), different manufacturers and produced 
at different scales have been placed on stability studies under long-term and accelerated conditions.  
A 50 ml scaled-down version of the active substance bioprocess container is used in the stability studies, 
using the same product contact material. 
Real time data for several batches have been provided. Data from studies under accelerated conditions 
has been provided. 
Stability studies under stress conditions (agitation, temperature, oxidation, deamidation, acid and base 
hydrolysis as well as freeze-thaw cycling and glycation) have been also performed, while photostability of 
ravulizumab was evaluated using finished product material. 
The proposed active substance shelf-life, protected from light, is supported by real time data and 
considered acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

polysorbate 80 is added as surfactant to enhance the stability of ravulizumab, preventing protein 
aggregation. 
The finished product composition has no overages. Vials are filled with a 1.75 ml overfill to ensure an 
adequate extractable volume. 
The finished product is manufactured by filtration of the active substance, followed by filling into a 
prepared sterile depyrogenated container closure system, and then sealing the filled and stoppered vials. 
All manufacturing steps are performed using aseptic techniques in qualified facilities, appropriately 
monitored, with qualified equipment. 
The finished product manufacturing process has been developed along three manufacturing facilities with 
minor changes. The most relevant modification, taking place at the last facility transfer, consisted of a 
change in vial size and fill volume, keeping all other characteristics unaltered. An exhaustive 
comparability and manufacturing equivalency assessment has been performed, demonstrating the 
consistency of the process to produce a finished product with the required quality.  
The primary container closure system consists of a 30 mL USP/Ph. Eur. Type I glass vial with a 20 mm 
stopper, and aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. The vial and stopper are compliant with all applicable 
requirements defined by the current Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. The selection of the primary container closure 
components was made on the basis of results of various physical, chemical, and functional testing of the 
components. The suitability of the primary packaging materials is properly demonstrated. 
A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D has been 
provided and supports negligible risk health hazard for elemental impurities. 
Overall, the studies on pharmaceutical development performed by the applicant are considered adequate 
to guarantee the quality of the product, its microbiological attributes, and its compatibility for the 
intended use. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing is a standard process that begins with pooling of the active substance 
through a bioburden reduction filter into the compounding vessel. Once the pooling process is complete, 
the active substance is sterile filtered and aseptically filled into sterile, depyrogenated vials using an 
automated filling machine. 
The finished product is processed continuously from active substance pooling and mixing through to 
aseptic filling and storage without any process intermediates. Parameters and in-process controls have 
been defined for every individual process step, including equipment and component preparation, pooling 
and stirring, sterile filtration, aseptic filling and capping.  
A finished product batch size range has been validated, allowing the use of one or two active substance 
batches per finished product batch. Validation of the manufacturing process has been successfully 
performed, in accordance with FDA and EMA guidelines, demonstrating the suitability and robustness of 
the process to produce ravulizumab finished product consistently meeting critical quality attribute 
requirements that reflect product quality. The validation program includes sterilisation and 
depyrogenation of equipment and components (vial washer, autoclaves, depyrogenation tunnel, sterile 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 16/128 
 
 
 
filtration and filling manifolds), sterility assurance validation, process qualification using 4 batches 
(assessing all process parameters, in-process controls and release tests on the finished product), and 
specific validation studies for filters (bubble point, rinsing, filter membrane compatibility, microbial 
retention, and extractable substances), finished product mixing, hold times and finished product 
shipment. The allowable time out of refrigeration during finished product manufacturing was determined. 
Requalification strategies have been properly described. 
All excipients comply with current monographs and are supplied with the corresponding certificate of 
analysis. No excipients of human or animal origin, or novel excipients, are used in the ravulizumab 
finished product manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The release and stability specification for the finished product includes tests for appearance, osmolality, 
pH, protein concentration, identity, purity/impurities, potency, endotoxin, sterility, container closure 
integrity, particulates and extractable volume. 
The proposed specifications for the finished product were developed by evaluation of the historical data 
from all clinical finished product batches, including process validation batches, using a mean evaluation. 
During the procedure, the applicant was asked to justify the specification for visible particles and to 
narrow the acceptance criteria of several parameters that are considered too wide. The applicant stated 
that only product free of particles pass the examination and that any deviation from this will be reported 
in line with Ph. Eur. 2031 requirement. In addition, the applicant agreed to tighten the acceptance criteria 
for some of the specification parameters. The applicant also commits to re-evaluate the finished product 
specification after data from a statistically significant number of batches manufactured by the validated 
process are available and to tighten the acceptance criteria if appropriate. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used specifically for the finished product comply with current Pharmacopeia and 
have been appropriately validated for their intended use, in accordance with the referenced Ph. Eur. 
monographs. 
Batch analysis 
Release data from several finished product batches have been presented. All batches comply with the 
specifications, demonstrating the consistency of the process and the uniformity of the finished product.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard information for the finished product is the same as described for active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies performed on the finished product were carried out in accordance with ICH Q5C. 
Finished product batches produced at different manufacturing sites and with different fill volumes have 
been placed on stability studies under long-term (2 – 8ºC) and accelerated (23 - 27ºC) conditions.  
Long term and accelerated stability data has been provided. 
A photostability study demonstrated that the finished product is photosensitive in its primary container, 
but that the secondary packaging appropriately protects it from light. 
An in-use compatibility exercise was performed to evaluate compatibility of the finished product with 
commonly used IV containers and IV sets, as well as the impact on transportation of the diluted finished 
product in the IV container.  Results from these studies confirm the chemical and physical stability of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 17/128 
 
 
 
diluted product of up to 6 hours at ambient (23-27°C) temperature, or refrigerated (2-8°C) up to 24 
hours. 
The applicant was requested to provide additional data to support the 30 months shelf-life proposed 
initially. The applicant updated the stability data and established a shelf-life of 24 months.  
The proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2 – 8ºC is supported by real time data generated with the 
intended commercial presentation (300 mg/30 ml) and is considered acceptable.  
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
The following post approval change management protocols (PAMCPs) are included in the dossier: 
•  Addition of a new active substance testing site.  
• 
Extension of Shelf-Life. 
The PACMPs include a description of changes, a risk assessment of the change impact on the product 
quality, the specific tests and studies to be performed, the control strategy, the process validation, the 
supportive data, the conditions to be fulfilled prior to implementation of the change and the data to be 
reported under the protocol.  
Adventitious agents 
The assessment of viral adventitious agents is in line with current EU guidelines. From the validation study 
of virus removal, three steps are considered to be effective – low pH virus inactivation, anion exchange 
chromatography II and virus filtration. The results and summaries of each virus removal validation step 
are presented and the provided information is considered adequate. The applicant also provided a 
summary compiling the global effect of all steps in the removal/inactivation of viruses.  
A production medium used may be of synthetic or biologic origin depending on the supplier. A risk 
assessment has been completed which concludes no risk to product quality or viral safety. The applicant 
confirmed compliance with the “Note for Guidance on Minimizing the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products" (EMA/410/01 rev. 3).  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Two major objections were raised during the procedure, one concerning the maintenance of the potency 
of the reference standard at the storage temperature of 2-8ºC and the second concerning GMP issues.  
With regard to the reference standard the applicant provided further evidence of the stability of the 
reference standard. In addition, the acceptance criteria of the re-qualification protocol were tightened 
and the shelf-life of the current reference standard was limited to 2 years. The applicant also committed 
to implement a 2-tier reference standard program to include frozen storage of a primary reference 
standard to minimize loss of potency. 
In response to the major objection on GMP issues, the applicant provided updated GMP certificates or 
evidence of positive GMP status issued by US FDA for the sites in question. In addition, new sites were 
introduced to fulfil the requirement for batch control testing to be conducted in the EU.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has designed and conducted non-clinical studies to prove the mechanism of action and 
compare the properties of ALXN1210 with those of eculizumab as well as to characterize whether any 
off-target binding and action can be revealed for ALXN1210. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The  Applicant  has  conducted  three  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  order  to  characterize  the 
pharmacodynamic properties of ALXN1210. 
Epitope mapping to assess cross-reactivity to C5 from other species – Study RTR-0006v1.0 
Epitope mapping studies conducted with ALXN1210 confirmed the binding site of ALXN1210 on human C5 
and identified 4 critical residues. Subsequent in vitro binding studies and haemolytic activity assays 
showed that ALXN1210 did not display any detectable specific binding to the recombinant C5 variant, nor 
did ALXN1210 block in vitro haemolysis in reactions containing the variant. In addition, ALXN1210 
showed no pharmacologic activity on haemolysis in serum from any non-human species tested (10 NHP 
and 13 non primate mammals).  
ALXN1210 differs from eculizumab at 4 amino acid substitutions in the heavy chain.  
Effects of pH on ALXN1210 binding to C5 and FcRn – Study RTR-0003v1.0 
In  vitro  binding  studies  of  ALXN1210  to  human  C5  and  FcRn  compared  to  eculizumab  showed  that 
ALXN1210 maintains a high affinity binding to C5 at pH7.4 that is sufficient to deliver complete terminal 
complement  inhibition  equivalent  to  eculizumab,  whereas  in  an  acidified  environment  amino  acid 
substitutions  significantly  attenuate  antigen-mediated  clearance  by  increasing  dissociation  of 
antibody:C5 complexes. Therefore, it is expected that in the acidified environment of the early endosome 
after pinocytosis (pH~6.0) K D of ALXN1210 would increase compared to eculizumab, but maintaining a 
high affinity binding affinity to C5 in the vascular compartment (pH 7.4) and increasing the fraction of 
antibody  recycled  from  the  early  endosome  back  into  the  vascular  compartment  by  FcRn.  Neither 
ALXN1210 nor eculizumab showed any detectable specific binding to FcRn at pH 7.4. 
The two amino acid substitutions in the first and second complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of 
the heavy chain variable region, weaken the affinity dissociation constant (KD) of ALXN1210 for C5 by ~ 
17-fold at pH 7.4 and ~ 36-fold at pH 6.0 compared with eculizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 19/128 
 
 
 
 
The  two  mutations  in  the  third  heavy  chain  constant  region  domain  (CH3),  strengthen  the  affinity  of 
ALXN1210 for FcRn by ~ 10-fold at pH 6.0 compared to eculizumab. 
Taken together these changes in binding to both C5 and FcRn are predicted to significantly attenuate 
TMDD by increasing dissociation of antibody:C5 complexes to free antibody in the acidified environment 
of the early endosome after pinocytosis, and to increase the fraction of antibody recycled from the early 
endosome back into the vascular compartment by FcRn. 
Comparison of PK/PD of ALXN1210 and eculizumab in an in vivo NOD-scid mice model – 
Study RTR-0008v1.0 
The findings from this study suggest that in the presence of human C5, ALXN1210 showed more than 
three-fold extension in half-life compared with eculizumab. In addition, the serum half-life of ALXN1210 
relative to eculizumab resulted in increased PD, as evidenced by prolonged haemolytic inhibition. The 
difference  in  PK/PD  profile  of  ALXN1210  and  eculizumab  was  attributed  to  attenuation  of 
antigen-mediated clearance through the mutations in the heavy chain CDRs of ALXN1210. 
Figure 1: Percentage of Haemolytic Activity in the Presence and Absence of ALXN1210 and Eculizumab in 
the NOD-scid Mice 
Haemolysis inhibition was complete for both eculizumab and ALXN1210 for 3 days. The haemolysis 
inhibitory effect of eculizumab declined rapidly after 3 days and completely disappeared by day 14 while 
ALXN1210 still retained 83% of haemolysis inhibitory effect on day 14 and showed reasonable 
effectiveness through 28 days. These data prove that the mutations in the heavy chain CDRs of ALXN1210 
attenuated the antigen-mediated clearance thus provided significantly longer effectiveness on the 
haemolysis inhibition. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Assessment Fc effector functions of ALXN1210 in vitro – study RTR 0005v1.0 
The studies described examine the binding of three humanized antibodies, ALXN1210, eculizumab and 
h5G1.1-IgG1 to molecules known to be mediators of antibody effector function. ALXN1210, eculizumab 
and h5G1.1-IgG1 are closely related antibodies. All three are humanized antibody antagonists of terminal 
complement binding the same epitope on human complement component C5 and preventing its cleavage 
during complement activation into its active metabolites, C5a and C5b. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 20/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Binding  experiments  using  ELISA,  SPR  and  biolayer  interferometry  all  indicate  that  the  amino  acid 
substitutions introduced into ALXN1210 do not appear to alter its binding affinity for FcγRI, FcγRIIb/c, 
FcγRIIIa,  FcγRIIIb  or  C1q,  relative  to  eculizumab.  The  ~  2  fold  increase  in  signal  for  ALXN1210  over 
eculizumab  in  an  ELISA  designed  to  measure  mulivalent  binding  to  FcγRIIa  is  not  corroborated  by 
increases  in  affinity  under  monovalent  conditions.  Given  the  weaker  affinities  overall  for  monovalent 
FcγRs, diminished signal relative to the IgG1 isotype observed under multivalent conditions and lack of 
detectable binding to C1q, combined with the soluble nature of the antigen itself, it is highly unlikely to be 
capable of initiating ADCC or CDC through these effector molecules.

A  Tissue  Cross-Reactivity  Study  of  Fluoresceinated  ALXN1210  in  Normal  Non-Human  Primate 
(Cynomolgus Monkey) Tissues – study 20039107 
The  objective  of  these  studies  was  to  determine  the  potential  cross-reactivity  of  fluoresceinated 
ALXN1210,  a  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  human  C5,  with  cryosections  of  human  and 
non-human primate (cynomolgus monkey) tissues. In order to detect binding, the fluoresceinated test 
article, designated ALXN1210-FITC, was applied to cryosections of normal human tissues (3 donors per 
tissue) or cynomolgus monkey tissues (2 donors per tissue) at two concentrations (20 and 2 μg/mL). In 
addition,  the  test  article  was  substituted  with  a  monoclonal  antibody  which  has  a  different  antigenic 
specificity from that of the test article (control article), designated OX-90G2G4-FITC. Other controls were 
produced by omission of the test or control articles from the assay (assay control). 
Tissue staining in cynomolgus monkey tissues was almost undetectable while in human tissues only C5 
secreting cells showed some positivity. Any sign of staining in human tissues that do not secrete C5 or 
non-human tissues might have been an artefact or some cross-reactivity with Fc rec

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No PD drug interaction studies have been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Limited nonclinical PK evaluation of ALXN1210 was conducted. ALXN1210 shows almost exclusive 
specificity to human C5; therefore, PK data from nonclinical studies are of limited value.  
Two non-clinical studies assessing PK and TK of ravulizumab following a single intravenous (IV) injection 
to cynomolgus monkeys or single and repeated subcutaneous (SC) doses in New Zealand White rabbits 
were completed. 
Absorption  
Following a single SC administration to rabbits at 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg, systemic exposure (Cmax and 
AUC0-168) of ravulizumab increased in a dose proportional manner. Observed median Tmax ranged from 
48 to 72 hours suggesting a slow absorption of ravulizumab from injection site. There were no PK 
differences by sex (Study 1727-050).

48  to  72  hours  suggesting  a  slow  absorption  of  ravulizumab  from  injection  site.  There  were  no  PK 
differences by sex.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed with ALXN1210 (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat dose toxicity studies were performed with ALXN1210 because it does not display detectable 
anti-C5 activity in nonhuman serum and therefore no relevant species for toxicity testing exist. Instead, 
a repeat-dose toxicity study in mice was performed using BB5.1, a murine anti-mouse C5 surrogate 
antibody.

In a four week dose range finding study in mice, BB5.1 mAb was administered to female mice by IV route, 
once, twice, or three times weekly resulting in weekly dose levels of 30, 60 or 90 mg/kg.  Controls 
received vehicle three times weekly. Neither treatment-related clinical signs nor effects on body weight or 
body weight change were observed. Serum analysis indicated similar extents of serum complement 
inhibition (mean haemolysis <20%, on days 8, 15, 23 and 29) for mice treated with BB5.1 mAb at 60 
versus 90 mg/kg/week. Since the extent of haemolytic prevention was so similar at both 60 and 90 
mg/kg, and greater at these doses than at 30 mg/kg/day (34±12% haemolysis day 8, 20%±13% day 15, 
<20% days 22 and 29), the recommended high dose of BB5.1 mAb in subsequent future toxicity studies 
in mice was 60 mg/kg/week. 
A twenty-six week study evaluated the toxicity of BB5.1 mAb when administered once or twice weekly by 
IV injection to mice for 26 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period (15-25 mice/sex/group). No 
unscheduled deaths occurred in the 30 mg/kg/wk dose group. Nine unscheduled deaths occurred during 
the study (4 in controls, and 5 in high dose group); none were related to treatment. Treatment did not 
affect any of the toxicity parameters examined. Serum analysis indicated that the extent of mean % 
haemolysis decreased from pre-treatment levels of 70-80 % to below 20 % in treated mice at weeks 12 
and 25. Although results were similar for both treated mice groups, the mean % haemolysis was slightly 
less for the 60 mg/kg/week mice in most instances. Following a four-week recovery period, the mean % 
haemolysis approximated pre-study values for both treatment groups. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed with ALXN1210.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed. Nonclinical studies utilizing the murine surrogate molecule of 
C5 blockade, BB5.1 were performed; in these studies no specific carcinogenicity risks were observed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed with ALXN1210. Instead, 
reproductive toxicity studies in mice were performed using BB5.1, a murine anti-mouse C5 surrogate 
antibody. 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
BB5.1 was administered IV to male and female CD-1 mice prior to mating until termination (males) or 
through early gestation (females) at 30 or 60 mg/kg/week (25/sex/group). Clinical observations, body 
weight and food consumption were evaluated. Treated males were paired with treated females during the 
mating period. On GD13, surviving pregnant and nonpregnant females were necropsied.  
There were no treatment-related mortalities or clinical observations or necropsy findings. BB5.1 had no 
effect on reproductive performance, although there was a slight depression in the mean absolute and 
relative prostate weights of the 60 mg/kg/week males. Sperm count and motility were not affected. There 
were no remarkable changes in any of the C-section parameters indicating that BB5.1 had no effect on 
implantation or embryo-fetal viability. 
Haemolytic activity was assessed in blood samples taken from females on GD12 and from males during 
week 4 and 10. Analysis of haemolytic activity showed that the mean percent haemolysis was generally 
≤50% in the treated groups, indicating systemic exposure to BB5.1.

Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for male toxicity was determined to be 60 mg/kg/week, 
while the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) for female toxicity, male and female fertility, and embryo-fetal 
viability was determined to be ≥60 mg/kg/week. 
Embryo-fœtal development 
BB5.1 was administered intravenously to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis (GD6-GD15) 
at 30, 60 mg/kg/week (25/group). Clinical observations, body weight and food consumption were 
evaluated. Mice were necropsied on GD18. Uteri were evaluated for number of live and dead foetuses and 
resorptions, and the ovaries were examined for the number of corpora lutea. Foetuses were weighed, 
sexed, and evaluated for external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. 
No clinical signs were found in this study. A few external and soft tissue malformations were observed in 
different foetuses: a single incidence of umbilical hernia and 2 foetal incidences of retinal dysplasia (one 
fetus from 2 separate litters) were observed in mice treated with BB5.1 mAb at a dose of 60 mg/kg/week. 
No treatment-related fetal malformations were observed in mice treated with 30 mg/kg/week. 
An exposure assessment was based on the degree of haemolytic activity in serum samples obtained; 
blood was collected prior to cesarean section on GD 18. Percentage haemolysis was highly variable in the 
treated groups although mean percentage haemolysis was ≤ 62.4% indicating systemic exposure. 
The NOEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity was determined to be ≥ 60 mg/kg/week, based 
on the lack of maternal and cesarean section findings at the highest dose of 60 mg/kg/. Based on the 
observed fetal soft tissue malformations at 60 mg/kg/week, the NOEL for developmental toxicity was 
determined to be 30 mg/kg/week. 
However, an independent toxicology consultant (RTI Project No. 08412.007, attached to study 6709-105) 
was contracted to evaluate the findings of malformations in the 60 mg/kg/week dose group. Following a 
critical review of the report data and the teratology literature, the consultant concluded that the foetal 
malformations were unlikely to be treatment-related due to presence of umbilical hernia in one historical 
control database and the possibility of the malformations occurring by artifact during necropsy or 
processing. Therefore, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity was considered to be ≥ 
60 mg/kg/week.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
BB5.1 was intravenously administered to pregnant mice (37/group) at 30 or 60 mg/kg/week from GD6 to 
LD18 (lactation day). This study endpoints were clinical observations, body weight changes, food 
consumption and general health, as well as reproductive outcomes in the F0 and F1 generations. During 
lactation and post-weaning F1 litters were evaluated for growth and development. Necropsies were 
performed on F0 and F1 adults and F2 offspring, as appropriate. 
Analysis of haemolytic activity showed that the mean percent haemolysis was lower in the treated groups 
compared to the control group, indicating systemic exposure to BB5.1. In the F0 generation there were no 
treatment-related mortalities, clinical findings or necropsy findings. Gestational and lactational body 
weights were not affected by BB5.1 mAb. No alterations were observed in the natural delivery and litter 
data from the F1 offspring, and in the F1 generation no treatment-related effects were observed, 
including overall reproductive performance. 
The NOEL for maternal toxicity and F1 pup development and reproductive performance through to 
parturition of the F2 generation was determined to be ≥ 60 mg/kg/week.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not performed with the current IV formulation of ALXN1210. However, no 
adverse injection site reactions were noted in the single dose IV PK study that was conducted with 
ALXN1210 in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, local tolerance was evaluated within the repeat-dose 
toxicity study in mice using BB5.1, the mouse surrogate antibody and no adverse injection site reactions 
were noted either grossly or by histopathology.  
A SC single and repeat-dose SC irritation study was conducted in rabbits. ALXN1210 administered 
subcutaneously caused a severe immune reaction after the second dose, leading to the premature 
sacrifice of several animals. However, these findings have questionable relevance for patients, as they 
were likely caused by the administration of a human protein to rabbits.  
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
ADA formation was detected in PK studies in monkeys and local tolerance studies in rabbits. However, the 
induction of antibody formation in animals is not fully predictive of a potential for antibody formation in 
humans. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody. Therefore, according to the Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 
it is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and it is exempted from environmental risk 
assessment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
ALXN1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed from the authorized eculizumab to bind 
and neutralize complement component 5 (C5).  
Ravulizumab binds to complement component 5 (C5) and blocks its activation by complement pathway 
convertases, thereby preventing the release of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a and the formation 
of the terminal complement complex via C5b. To ensure the same specificity of ALXN1210 binding to C5, 
residues in the variable region that make direct contact with C5 were not altered from eculizumab. 
Furthermore, the engineered changes in affinity were tailored such that they are sufficient to attenuate 
antigen-mediated clearance and also preserve the ability to fully inhibit terminal complement activity 
under physiological conditions. 
In vitro studies conducted with ALXN1210 confirmed the binding site of ALXN1210 on human C5; however 
binding of ALXN1210 to nonhuman C5 variants were not detected. In addition, ALXN1210 showed no 
pharmacologic activity on haemolysis in serum from any non-human species tested (10 NHP and 13 non 
primate mammals). When compared to eculizumab, it is expected that in the acidified environment of the 
early endosome after pinocytosis (pH~6.0) KD of ALXN1210 would increase compared to eculizumab, but 
maintaining a high affinity binding affinity to C5 in the vascular compartment (pH 7.4) and increasing the 
fraction of antibody recycled from the early endosome back into the vascular compartment by FcRn. 
As the pharmacological target of ALXN1210, human C5 is only functional outside of the cells, in vitro 
testing with human cell lines would not be relevant. Additionally, clinical experience with use of 
eculizumab for long term C5 blockade has not shown any increased risk for CNS, cardiovascular, or 
respiratory effects.

In vivo pharmacology studies studies in a mice model showed that ALXN1210 has a significant longer 
half-life and PD effect than eculizumab.  
Results from PK/PD studies conducted in a mouse PK model showed a significantly longer half-life of 
ravulizumab  compared to eculizumab in the presence of human C5, suggesting that antigen-mediated 
clearance of ravulizumab was attenuated. Furthermore, the extended exposure of ravulizumab 
corresponded to extended duration of PD effect relative to eculizumab. However, since the analytical 
method used in this study was not validated, the PK results from this study cannot be regarded as usable 
for the evaluation of ravulizumab. 
PK data after single dose administration were obtained in monkeys and rabbits. In the IV study in 
monkeys, only 2 animals/sex were in each group, which does not facilitate the interpretation of the 
results. Therefore, the Applicant is asked to explain the validity and robustness of these PK data. Upon 
evaluation of the clarification of this issue it was concluded that the study data is considered acceptable 
since it provides an acceptable approximation to the PK immunogenicity to the test compound despite the 
low numbers of animals used in the study. Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner, whereas AUC 
increased in a less than proportional manner, probably due to the presence of anti-human antibodies that 
could increase the clearance. ADAs were found in 75-100% of the ALXN1210 treated animals. However, 
the induction of antibody formation in animals is not predictive of a potential for antibody formation in 
humans. The bioanalytical methods used in this study were validated, but details of the validation are 
missing. Since the data submitted for clarification contains only a summary of results, and it was declared 
that no assay validation (in-study validation) was performed, the PK results from this study cannot be 
regarded as usable for the evaluation of ravulizumab. Since this validation cannot be supplemented, no 
further action is possible. 
The study in rabbits was conducted by subcutaneous administration with a higher concentration than the 
clinical IV formulation and with different excipients, so the relevance of this study is limited. It was 
planned with a single dose and a repeated dose phase, but it was terminated earlier than planned due to 
limiting toxicity (see section 4.6 of this AR) and only TK data from single dose administration are 
available. In this study, Cmax and AUC increased in a dose proportional manner. The observed tmax 
ranged from 48 to 72 hours suggesting slow absorption of ALXN1210 from the injection site. There were 
no differences by sex. The incidence of ADA ranged from 83 to 100%; however as mentioned before this 
is not predictive of a potential immunogenicity in humans.  
Overall, the PK data available with ALXN1210 are limited; however, as highlighted in the EMA scientific 
advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/403560/2016), given the lack of cross-reactivity with non-human tissues, the 
PK profile evaluation of ALXN1210 should be adequately assessed in humans.  
The lack of safety pharmacology studies is considered acceptable. 
General toxicity and reproductive toxicity studies were submitted and assessed in the Soliris (eculizumab) 
MAA and they were conducted with CD-1 mice using BB5.1, a murine anti-mouse surrogate antibody; 
therefore, the relevance of these studies is limited. This is considered acceptable due to the lack of 
cross-reactivity with non-human tissues of ALXN1210. However, findings regarding reproductive toxicity 
and local tolerance were detected. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies no signs of toxicity were seen. Pharmacodynamic activity (C5 
blockade) was determined in serum through a cultured RBC haemolysis assay, with a decrease of the 
haemolytic activity from pre-treatment levels of 70-80% to below 20% in treated groups, confirming 
adequate exposure and biological activity.  
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of 
ravulizumab. The lack of these studies is acceptable as ICH S6 (R1) guideline indicates that nonclinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 27/128 
 
 
 
 
carcinogenicity studies are not generally considered relevant to biotechnology products. ALXN1210 does 
not display detectable anti-C5 activity in serum from species normally used for such testing (mice and 
rats) and pharmacological profile of ALXN1210 does not show any proliferative, or growth factor like 
activities. 
Animal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with ravulizumab, but were conducted in 
mice with a murine surrogate complement inhibitory antibody, BB5.1. Reproductive toxicity studies 
showed no effect on reproductive performance, fertility markers and implantation or embryo-foetal 
viability. Haemolytic activity was assessed in these studies showing a dose-related exposure to BB5.1 
mAb. No clear treatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in the murine surrogate 
reproductive toxicology studies in mice. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during 
organogenesis, some external and soft tissue malformations were found; two cases of retinal dysplasia 
and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the 
higher antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human ravulizumab dose, 
based on a body weight comparison). However, the exposure did not increase foetal loss or neonatal 
death. Although it was determined that it is unlikely that these findings are treatment-related; umbilical 
hernia and retinal dysplasia were assessed in the light of the current knowledge about the role of C5 in 
organogenesis (e.g. JD Leslie, R Mayor. Complement in animal development: Unexpected roles of a highly 
conserved pathway. Semin Immunol. 2013 Feb; 25(1): 39–46. doi: [10.1016/j.smim.2013.04.005]. 
Based on the literature review assessment, it was not proven that complement system, or specifically C5 
blockade, may impact organogenesis in human retinas or umbilical herniation during development.  
No specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. 
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule (BB5.1) 
identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males. 
Regarding local tolerance, a detailed assessment of findings observed in the repeat-dose toxicology 
studies and a justification that the results of local tolerance study in mice is the basis for the assessment 
of human local tolerability. Animal and human studies indicated that the final ravulizumab clinical 
formulation has an acceptable local tolerance profile.  
Aspects on the risk assessment for elemental impurities are satisfactorily addressed in accordance with 
ICH Q3D. 
General repeated-dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity studies were already submitted and assessed in 
the Soliris (eculizumab) MAA. However, additional toxicity studies with a new murine surrogate mAb are 
not expected to add any relevant information to the toxicology profile characterization of ALXN1210. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, pharmacologic and toxicological characterization is acceptable. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on nonclinical studies using a murine 
surrogate molecule, BB5.1, in mice.

a  Ravulizumab SC, N = 24; ravulizumab IV, N = 12. Abbreviations: IV = intravenous; SC = subcutaneous 
Four Phase I studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to collect data on safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, PK and PD. A Phase 1b and a Phase 2 dose escalation studies were conducted for dose 
selection in patients with PNH who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment. Two Phase 3 studies 
were conducted as pivotal studies, one in patients with PNH who were naïve to complement inhibitor 
treatment and other in patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with 
eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Ravulizumab is a solution administered by IV infusion. Because the route of administration is an IV 
infusion and the dosage form is a solution, 100% of the administered dose is considered bioavailable. The 
time to maximum observed serum concentration (tmax) is expected at the end of infusion (EOI); however, 
because of the long terminal elimination half-life of ravulizumab and variability, the observed tmax in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 29/128 
 
 
 
  
 
 
clinical trials occurred either at or soon after EOI. Therapeutic steady-state drug concentrations are 
reached after the first dose.  
Bioequivalence  
The to-be-marketed ravulizumab drug product is a 10 mg/mL formulation for IV administration; all 
current clinical studies have utilized this formulation. This drug product is diluted to 5 mg/ml using 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution for injection prior to administration. 
Influence of food 
Given that ravulizumab is IV administered, there is no anticipated interaction with food. 
Distribution 
After a single dose administration of ravulizumab in healthy volunteers (Study ALXN1210-HV-101) the 
geometric mean Cmax (%CV) of ALXN1210 was 78.5 (10.2%) μg/ml following the 200-mg dose, and 139 
(16.2%) μg/ml following the 400-mg dose. The observed median (range) Tmax was 2.4 (0.8 to 4.2) 
hours for the 200-mg dose, and 0.66 (0.59 to 1.2) hours for the 400-mg dose. Geometric mean (%CV) 
AUC∞ was 47,300 (13.9%) μg x h/mL for the 200-mg dose, and 80,400 (21.0%) μg x h/ml for the 
400-mg dose. 
In Study ALXN1210-HV-102, the maximal concentrations of ALXN1210 generally increased following each 
successive dose for the 400–mg and the 800–mg groups. The geometric mean maximum observed serum 
concentrations (Cmax) (geometric %CV) of ALXN1210 following the first dose were 133.4 (20.9%) and 
269.8 (15.1%) μg/ml for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. After the fifth dose, the 
geometric mean Cmax (geometric %CV) values were 208.2 (15.6%) and 452.2 (10.9%) μg/ml for the 
400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. Consistent with the Cmax, the geometric mean Ctrough 
(geometric %CV) values were 32.9 (11.5%), and 71.9 (13.2%) μg/mL after the first dose and increased 
to 95.4 (13.0%), and 233.5 (14.4%) μg/ml after the fifth dose for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, 
respectively. The median (range) tmax from all 5 periods was 1.08 (0.58 to 24.00) hours and 1.67 (1.17 
to 8.00) hours for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. 
Geometric mean AUCτ increased following each infusion for both the 400–mg and 800–mg dose groups. 
The geometric mean AUCτ (geometric %CV) values of ALXN1210 after the first dose were 36781.9 
(12.6%) and 78638.4 (12.1%) μg*h/ml for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. After the fifth 
dose, the geometric mean AUCτ (geometric %CV) increased to 84623.4 (13.5%) and 196755.3 (9.3%) 
μg*h/ml for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. 
Following the fifth dose, the geometric mean total clearance (CL) was similar between doses, at 0.005 and 
0.004 L/h for the 400–mg and 800–mg groups, respectively. The geometric mean Vss (geometric %CV) 
values were consistent at 5.8 (18.9%) and 5.2 (9.6%) L for the 400–mg and 800–mg dose groups, 
respectively. The median (range) half-lives (t½) were 31.3 (29.5 to 35.0) and 33.5 (27.3 to 42.6) days 
for the 400–mg and 800–mg dose groups, respectively. 
The mean (SD) estimates for the central volume of distribution (Vc) and intercompartmental volume of 
distribution (Vp) in healthy adult subjects (Study ALXN1210-HV-102; N = 12) from the Final Pop-PK 
model are 3.25 L (0.36) and 2.18 L (0.25), respectively. The mean (SD) estimates for Vc and Vp in 
patients with PNH from the Phase 3 studies (N = 222) from the Final Pop-PK model are 3.45 L (0.65) and 
1.91 L (0.32), respectively. No meaningful difference was noted between healthy adult subjects and 
patients with PNH. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019

The mean (standard deviation [SD]) volume of distribution at steady state for patients with PNH on the 
studied weight-based dose regimen was 5.34 (0.92) L.  
Elimination 
After a single dose administration of ravulizumab in healthy volunteers (Study ALXN1210-HV-101) the 
geometric mean t½ (%CV) was 32.4 (16.2%) days, and 30.8 (10.2%) days for the 200-mg and 400-mg 
doses, respectively. 
After repeated drug administration (Study ALXN1210-HV-102) the median t½ were 31.3 days and 33.5 
days for the 400-mg and 800-mg dose groups, respectively. 
Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. The mean 
(SD) values for terminal elimination half-life and clearance of ravulizumab in patients with PNH are 
49.7 (8.9) days and 0.003 (0.001) L/h, respectively. 
Excretion 
Due to the size of the molecule it is not expected that renal excretion may occur. 
Metabolism 
No data regarding the metabolism of the drug has been presented. 
As  an  immunoglobulin  gamma  (IgG)  mAb,  ravulizumab  is  expected  to  be  metabolized  in  the  same 
manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) 
and is subject to similar elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
After a single dose administration of ravulizumab to healthy volunteers (Study ALXN1210-HV-101) 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC∞ indicate that exposures to 200 mg and 400 mg increased in a less than 
dose-proportional manner. 
Table 4 
However, in Study ALXN1210-HV-102 a 2-fold increase in the dose from 400 mg to 800 mg led to an 
increase of approximately 2.1-fold in ALXN1210 exposure after a single dose administration. The median 
tmax after the ALXN1210 800–mg dose was approximately 0.5 hours longer (1.67hours) than the tmax 
after the 400-mg dose (1.08 hours). The mean CL and Vss were similar between the 400-mg and 800-mg 
doses of ALXN1210. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019

Dose proportional increases in Cmax, Ctrough, and AUCτ were observed following administration of single 
and multiple doses of 400 mg and 800 mg of ALXN1210. Following once-every-28 days dosing, PK steady 
state evaluated on the basis of Ctrough was attained by Day 85. The geometric mean accumulation ratios 
for AUCτ and Cmax following the fifth dose of ALXN1210 were 2.21 and 1.50, respectively, for the 400-mg 
dose group and 2.35 and 1.57, respectively, for the 800-mg dose group. 
The results for PK dose proportionality for ALXN1210 using the power model are presented here: 
Table 5: Pharmacokinetic Dose Proportionality – Power Model – Pharmacokinetic 
Population 
Over the studied dose (200 to 5400 mg) and regimen range (up to every 12 weeks [q12w] dosing), the 
final population PK (Pop PK) modeling results have shown that ravulizumab exhibited dose-proportional 
and time-linear. 
Time dependency 
This point has been evaluated in the popPK model and the results did not point towards a time 
dependency in the pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In healthy volunteers variability of critical PK parameters between 10- 20% while in patients somewhat 
large in the 20- 30% range.

Overall, the final Pop-PK model was deemed to be appropriately specified, with population typical values 
and covariate effects estimated with good precision. Using this Final Pop-PK model, post-hoc individual 
terminal  elimination  half-life  estimates  were  derived.  The  estimated  mean  (SD)  terminal  elimination 
half-life of ravulizumab in 222 Phase 3 patients with PNH is 49.7 (8.9) days.

Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
No study has been performed in patients with severe renal impairment.  
It is expected that ravulizumab is metabolized as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and 
amino  acids  via  catabolic  pathways),  with  a  similar  elimination,  thus  no  dose  adjustment  is  deemed 
necessary in patients with renal impairment. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
No study has been performed in hepatic insufficiency.  
Ravulizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic metabolic enzymes or renal elimination.   
• 
Gender 
Population PK analysis revealed that females typical CL is approximately 18% lower than that observed in 
males. 
This effect is not considered clinically relevant. 
• 
Race 
Study  ALXN1210-HV-104  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label,  single  ascending  and  multiple  set  dose  study 
designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of IV ravulizumab in healthy 
Japanese subjects.

Although mean Cmax and AUC values in Japanese healthy subjects seem to be slightly higher than those 
obtained in non-Japanese healthy subjects, this effect does not seem to be relevant considering that the 
target population in Europe is not this race. 
• 
Weight 
Patients with body weight between 40 to < 60 kg treated with a 3,000-mg MD q8w presented mean 
Ctrough,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cavg,ss values of approximately 20%, 17%, and 19% higher than patients 
with body weight between 60 to < 100 kg treated with a 3,300-mg MD q8w, respectively.  
Patients with body weight ≥100 kg treated with a 3,600-mg MD q8w presented mean Ctrough,ss, 
Cmax,ss, and Cavg,ss values of 16%, 10%, and 14% lower than patients with body weight ≥ 60 to < 100 
kg treated with a 3,300-mg MD q8w, respectively. These results confirmed the adequacy of the proposed 
dosing rationale based on weight.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
Ravulizumab specifically binds to human complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its 
cleavage to C5a and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement complex [C5b-9]) during 
complement activation. This inhibition prevents the release of the proinflammatory mediator C5a and the 
formation of the cytolytic pore-forming membrane attack complex C5b-9 while preserving the proximal or 
early components of complement activation (eg, C3 and C3b) essential for the opsonization of 
microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes. 
The hallmark of PNH disease activity is complement-mediated haemolysis. Paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria is caused by a somatic (acquired) mutation of the PIG-A gene that leads to a lack of 
CD55 and CD59, which are key, naturally occurring terminal complement inhibitor proteins on cell 
surfaces (Hill, 2013). The absence of these complement inhibitor proteins on the cell surface results in 
continuous activation of the alternative complement pathway and chronic intravascular haemolysis. 
Intravascular haemolysis releases free haemoglobin, resulting in nitric oxide consumption and persistent 
smooth muscle cell contraction, along with an increased risk of severe thromboembolism. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 36/128 
 
 
 
 
This mechanism of action provides the therapeutic rationale for the use of ravulizumab in PNH, in which 
uncontrolled complement activation is involved.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacological effect of ravulizumab is the decrease of LDH. A few variables were studied 
as secondary ones such as: mean total C5 concentration, mean free C5 concentration, chicken red blood 
cell haemolysis, complement C5b-9 concentrations, CPP and CAP activity and QT/QTc. 
After single and oral doses of 200 and 400 mg of ravulizumab, mean total C5 concentrations decreased 
(%) from baseline a 15.42% and 14.10%, respectively. The administration of repeated doses of 400mg 
and 800 mg in healthy volunteers produced an increase of a 63.5% and 82.5% in total C5 concentrations. 
This effect was similar to that observed in the phase II studies, with mean increases around 55% (for 
maintenance doses of 1000 and 1600mg). However, higher maintenance doses of 2400 and 5400 mg 
only increased mean total C5 concentrations by 36.7 and 29.38%. This effect was characterized for a 
higher effect in the initial doses, and lower at later maintenance doses.  The mean total effect in phase III 
studies is higher than in the phase II studies, and this decrease in the effect over time was not observed 
in phase III studies; however, the results from phase III studies have been presented for 183 days.  
Figure 5: Exploratory Analysis – ALXN1210-PNH-301 - Mean (±SD) Concentration-Time of 
PK, Total C5 and cRBC –Eculizumab Arm (Linear Scale) – Overall 
Ravulizumab decreased free C5 concentrations to values lower than 99% of the baseline value in phase I 
and phase II studies. In phase III studies, the proposed dosing schedule produced a decrease in free C5 
concentrations to values lower than the target 5 microg/mL. The effect was observed for all the patients 
included in the studies, and for a period of time of up to 183 days. The results were compared to 
eculizumab, and although the mean results were similar, some of the patients in the eculizumab arm 
presented free C5 concentrations above the target concentration.

An in-vitro study 12 different C5 concentrations at 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.13, 
0.04 and 0.01µg/mL were prepared by spiking purified human C5 into C5 depleted human serum. A cRBC 
haemolysis response was assessed at each of the serum C5 concentration. 
Figure 6: % cRBC Haemolysis vs. C5 Concentration 
In phase I studies cRBC haemolysis followed a time course almost parallel to that observed for free C5 
concentrations. In study ALXN1210-PNH-201 and ALXN1210-PNH-302 studies a decrease of the effect 
over time was observed. The decrease in the drug effect was more prominent after the last dose 
compared to the previous ones. Therefore, the applicant should explain whether this decrease in the 
effect on cRBC haemolysis might be pointing to a possible decrease of drug efficacy in the long term. 
In phase I studies after a single oral dose of 200mg or 400 mg of ALXN1210 mean complement C5b-9 
concentrations decreased between 28 and 43% and remained relatively stable up to 168 hours after the 
drug intake. 
ALXN1210 produced a decrease of CPP and CAP activity of around a 95% of the baseline value after the 
administration of single oral doses of 200 mg or 400 mg. The baseline values were almost recovered by 
day 253 after multiple administrations of 400 mg and 800 mg. 
Based on a PK-QT/QTc relationship, the changes observed in the pd variable do not seem to be related to 
the exposure to the drug. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No exposure-response relationships were observed for TEAEs observed in less than 10% of patients in 
Studies ALXN1210-PNH-301 and ALXN1210-PNH-302.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A total of 164 patients with PNH from 3 clinical studies (ALXN1210-PNH-103, ALXN1210- PNH-201, and 
ALXN1210-PNH-301)  were  included  in  the  PK/PD  analysis  of  LDH.  Exploratory  analyses  were  first 
performed to visually assess longitudinal profiles of LDH.   
Figure  7:  Mean  (SD)  Concentration-Time  Profiles  of  LDH  Following  Administration  of 
Ravulizumab 
The response profile of LDH was characterized by a rapid onset after administration of the first dose of 
ravulizumab,  and  suppression  of  LDH  concentrations  was  sustained  during  the  maintenance  phase  of 
ravulizumab treatment. The majority of LDH levels remained within 468 U/L (ie, 2 x the upper limit of 
normal) for the whole study duration. 
An indirect PK/PD response model (with a zero-order production of LDH response and inhibitory effect of 
ravulizumab on the zero-order production of LDH) previously provided an adequate description of the 
observed data (ALXN1210 Dose Rationale, 2016). The above indirect PK/PD model was used in a first step 
to assess the longitudinal profiles of LDH. Population PK/PD parameters are presented in Table 2.2.7.2

Table 10:  Population PK/PD Analysis of LDH – Parameters Estimates 
Typical Imax was 0.825, suggesting that the administration of ravulizumab is expected to suppress LDH 
levels through a maximum 82.5% inhibition of the synthesis rate (Kin) of LDH (ie, E0 * Kout). The mean 
IC95 derived with the PK/PD model was 146 µg/ml, suggesting a steep concentration effect relationship. 
Mean Ctroughss in patients with body weight values ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, and ≥ 100 kg were 
3.9-, 3.2-, and 2.7-fold higher than the estimated IC95, respectively. Mean Cavg ss in patients with body 
weight values ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, and ≥ 100 kg (refer to Table 14) were 6.0-, 5.0-, and 
4.3-fold higher than the estimated IC95, respectively. Based on the above results, differences in exposure 
between males and females, and according to baseline haemoglobin levels were not deemed clinically 
relevant.  
A total of 27 (<1%) LDH concentrations out of 2,954 measurement were associated with CWRES values 
>|4|. A sensitivity analysis was performed without concentrations associated with CWRES values >|4|. 
Typical  E0,  Imax,  and  Kout  derived  without  concentrations  associated  with  CWRES  values  >|4|  were 
within  1%  of  those  derived  in  the  original  analysis.  The  typical  IC95  and  Hill  coefficient  parameters 
derived  without  CWRES  values  >|4|  were  within  10%  and  7%,  respectively,  of  those  derived  in  the 
original analysis (back-transformed scale). 
In  addition,  a 
total  of  11  (<1%)  LDH  concentrations  were  associated  with  coinciding 
complement-amplifying  condition  (CAC)  episodes.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  without  LDH 
samples  associated  with  CAC  episodes.  Typical  E0,  Imax,  and  Kout  values  derived  without  samples 
associated with CAC episodes were within 1% of those derived in the original analysis. The typical Hill 
coefficient parameter estimated without LDH samples associated with CAC episodes was within 3% of 
that derived in the original analysis (back-transformed scale). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab has been based on six different studies (two phase I in healthy 
volunteers, two phase II studies performed in PNH, and two phase III studies in patients with PNH who 
received either ravulizumab or eculizumab). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 40/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the route of ravulizumab administration is an intravenous infusion and the dosage form is a solution, 
100 % of the administered dose is considered bioavailable. The time to maximum observed concentration 
(t max) is expected at the end of infusion (EOI) or soon after EOI. Therapeutic steady-state drug 
concentrations are reached after the first dose. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) volume of 
distribution at steady state for patients with PNH on the studied weight-based dose regimen was 
5.34 (0.92) L.  
As an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized in 
the same manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic 
pathways), and is subject to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring amino acids 
and has no known active metabolites. The mean (SD) values for terminal elimination half-life and 
clearance of ravulizumab in patients with PNH are 49.7 (8.9) days and 0.003 (0.001) L/h, respectively. 
Over the studied dose and regimen range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear 
pharmacokinetics (PK). 
When given the same dose, heavier patients with PNH had lower median serum ravulizumab 
concentrations compared with lighter patients. Weight-based dosing is proposed in SmPC section 4.2. No 
formal trial of the effect of sex, race, age (geriatric), hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of ravulizumab was conducted. However, based on population-PK assessment no impact of sex, age, race 
and hepatic or renal function on ravulizumab PK was identified in the studied healthy volunteers subjects 
and patients with PNH, and as a result, no dosing adjustment is considered necessary. 
Two population pharmacokinetic models have been developed, the first one at EOP2, and the second one 
including data from phase III studies, as well as data from phase I and II - using two approaches: 
noncompartmental approach and population modelling approach. The first model developed was used to 
simulate different dose and dosing schedules. The final popPK model was used to confirm that the 
selected doses in phase 3 studies permitted to achieve the target concentrations. Moreover, the model 
was used as the input function for a popPKPD model of the primary pharmacology (percent of change on 
the LDH).  
Secondary variables evaluated included free C5 concentrations, total C5 concentrations, chicken red 
blood cells haemolysis, complement C5b-9 concentrations, CPP and CAP activity and QT/QTc. Two of the 
secondary variables, total C5 concentrations and chicken red blood cells haemolysis showed a decrease of 
the drug effect over time up to 52 and 26 weeks were presented. Total C5 does not seem to change up to 
52 weeks.  The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab depends on weight, BMI, 
haemoglobin and gender. Information regarding the qualification of the model has been adequately 
presented and the model fit has been accepted. 
The drug produced inconsistent changes in total C5 concentrations when dose in considered, however 
these changes can be explained by the limited number of participants included in some cohorts, and the 
variability in the response. The effect over time showed a decrease in the effect of the drug at different 
maintenance regimens up to 26 weeks. However, new data of total C5 has shown that the effect is 
maintained up to 52 weeks. No data further than 26 weeks were presented for the chicken red blood cells 
haemolysis. The decrease in free C5 concentrations was higher than 99% in phase I and phase II studies. 
In the two phase III studies free C5 concentrations were maintained below the target concentration of 5 
microg/mL in all studied patients up to 183 days. No data up to 52 weeks has been presented.  
Two different analytical methods were used to quantify free C5 concentrations following ravulizumab and 
eculizumab treatments in the pivotal phase 3 trials. A cross-validation exercise revealed that the two 
methods provide statistically different results for the very same sample. So, difference between free C5 
levels following ravulizumab and eculizumab treatments partly might be due to fact that different assay 
methods were used.

AlXN1210 produced a decrease of CPP and CAP activity of around a 95% of the baseline value after the 
administration of single oral doses of 200 mg or 400 mg. The baseline values were almost recovered by 
day 253 after multiple administrations of 400 mg and 800 mg. 
Ravulizumab exhibited a low incidence of immunogenicity in patients with PNH (< 0.5%), However, it is 
not clear that anti-ravulizumab could have been detected in Phase 3 trials at all because the trough serum 
levels were above the drug tolerance levels of the applied ADA assays.  As Table 2.1.2.6 shows the lowest 
drug tolerance limits are below trough levels. 
Based on a PK-QT/QTc relationship, the changes observed in the pd variable do not seem to be related to 
the exposure to the drug. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data on clinical pharmacology aspects are considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation of 
Ultomiris. Relevant pharmacology information has been reflected in the SmPC section 5.2 and 4.2. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical studies evaluating ravulizumab were designed to evaluate safety and 
efficacy and explore dose and dosing regimens in patients with PNH. Adult patients with a documented 
diagnosis of PNH, elevated LDH (≥3 x ULN), and no prior use of complement inhibitors were eligible for 
enrolment. 
Study ALXN1210-PNH-103 assessed a range of doses infused at 28-day intervals, and Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-201 assessed higher induction doses and longer dosing intervals.  
Integrated population PK and PK PD/LDH analyses were performed using pooled data from these studies 
to characterize PK and covariates influencing PK, and to explore PK PD and PK LDH relationships for 
identifying the Phase 3 dosing regimen. 
Additionally, these early phase studies included an Extension Period to explore the long term safety of 
ravulizumab in patients with PNH.

Study  ALXN1210-PNH-103  is a Phase 1b, open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter, intrapatient dose 
escalation  study  designed  to  explore  the  safety,  tolerability,  efficacy,  PK/PD,  and  immunogenicity  of 
ravulizumab in adult patients with PNH who were not previously treated with a complement inhibitor. 
Recruitment was conducted in South Korea and Australia. 13 patients were enrolled in this study. All 13 
patients received 1 of 3 induction regimens of ravulizumab followed by maintenance doses of ravulizumab 
900 mg (Cohort 1, N = 6) or ravulizumab 1800 mg (Cohort 2, N = 7) through Day 169, after which they 
entered an Extension Period of up to 3 years and continue treatment with ravulizumab. Initially, patients 
continued treatment with ravulizumab at the same maintenance dose and frequency as their randomized 
treatment assignment. After the start of the Phase 3 studies, all patients in the Phase 1b study changed 
to a body weight-based dosing regimen of ravulizumab IV 3000 to 3600 mg maintenance doses every 8 
weeks (q8w). 
Study  ALXN1210-PNH-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of ravulizumab administered IV to adult patients 
with PNH who had not been previously treated with a C5 complement inhibitor.  
The study had 4 treatment cohorts, with at least 6 patients planned per cohort. Each cohort of patients 
received a different dose and dosing schedule of ravulizumab during the Treatment Period. 
26  patients  were  enrolled in  this  study.  All  26  patients  received an  induction  regimen  of  ravulizumab 
followed  by  maintenance  doses  of  1000  mg  every  4 weeks  (q4w)  (Cohort  1,  N = 6),  1600  mg  every 
6 weeks (q6w) (Cohort 2, N = 6), 2400 mg q8w (Cohort 3, N = 7), and 5400 mg q12w (Cohort 4, N = 7). 
All 26 patients completed the 24-week Primary Evaluation Period (up to Day 253 for Cohorts 1 to 3 and up 
to  Day  281  for  Cohort  4)  without  dose  adjustment  or  discontinuation,  after  which  they  entered  an 
Extension Period of up to 5 years and continue treatment with ravulizumab. Initially, patients continued 
treatment with ravulizumab at the same maintenance dose and frequency as their randomized treatment 
assignment. After the start of the Phase 3 studies, all patients in the Phase 2 study changed to a body 
weight-based regimen of ravulizumab IV 3000 to 3600 mg maintenance doses q8w (except for Cohort 4 
which remained on 5400 mg every 12 weeks [q12w]).

The dosing regimen studied in the ravulizumab PNH Phase 3 studies was developed using modeling and 
simulation methods that utilized the Phase 1 and Phase 2 PK, PD, and LDH data over a wide range of doses 
and regimens in healthy volunteers and patients with PNH, and was subsequently confirmed on the basis 
of the Phase 3 safety and efficacy data.  
The recommended body weight-based dosing regimen is a loading dose administered on Day 1 followed 
by  q8w  administration  of  the  maintenance  dose  starting  on  Day  15.  No  modification  of  this  dosing 
regimen is required for any special populations or demographic subgroups.

Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• 
to assess the non-inferiority of ALXN1210 compared to eculizumab in adult patients with PNH 
who had never been treated with a complement inhibitor. 
Non-inferiority was claimed if after 26 weeks of treatment (1) the lower bound of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference (ALXN1210 - eculizumab) in transfusion avoidance (TA) rate was greater 
than  -20%,  and  (2)  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  odds  ratio  of  ALXN1210  compared  with 
eculizumab for lactate dehydrogenase normalization (LDH-N) was greater than 0.39.

• Proportion of patients experiencing MAVEs from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) 
Sample size 
Approximately 214 patients were planned to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ALXN1210 (N 
= 107) or eculizumab (N = 107) to ensure at least 193 evaluable patients (assumes no more than a 10% 
drop-out rate). The sample size estimation was based on a non-inferiority design comparing 
ALXN1210-treated patients with eculizumab-treated patients. 
Coprimary endpoints of haemolysis as directly measured by LDH-N from Day 29 through Day 183 and the 
proportion of patients who achieve TA through Day 183 were used to assess non-inferiority. For the 
coprimary endpoint of LDH-N, using a non-inferiority margin (NIM) based on the relative benefit of 
eculizumab with respect to placebo of 0.39 and a type I error of 1-sided 2.5%, a minimum of 142 patients 
would have been expected to provide 80% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of ALXN1210 to 
eculizumab. The NIM was determined based on the TRIUMPH study, a randomized placebo- controlled 
study of eculizumab in patients with PNH (Hillmen, 2006). For the other co-primary endpoint of proportion 
of patients achieving TA through Day 183, using a NIM of -20% and a type I error of 1-sided 2.5%, a 
minimum of 193 patients would have been expected to provide 80% power to demonstrate non-inferiority 
between the treatment arms.

Randomisation 
Patients  who  met  all  criteria  for  enrolment  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  with  ALXN1210  or 
eculizumab. Treatment group assignment was determined by a computer-generated random sequence 
using  an  interactive  voice-  or  web-response  system  (IxRS).  The  randomization  was  a  stratified 
randomization. Patients were stratified into 6 groups based on their transfusion history (0, 1 to 14, or > 
14 units of pRBCs in the 1 year prior to first dose of study drug) and screening LDH levels (1.5 to < 3 or 
≥ 3 × ULN). The patients within each of the 6 groups were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
ALXN1210 or eculizumab during the 26-week Primary Evaluation Period.

Blinding (masking) 
The Phase 3 studies of ravulizumab in patients with PNH had an open-label design to allow for a 
comparison of the potential treatment differences of a q2w dose regimen versus a q8w dose regimen. 
Because ravulizumab has a prolonged elimination half-life compared to eculizumab and thus a longer 
dosing interval, the administration schedules of ravulizumab and eculizumab are markedly different.  
The MAH has evaluated and has minimized as much as possible the potential impact and bias of not 
performing a double-blind study to ensure the adequacy of the clinical trial results. Specifically: 
o  Haemolysis as directly measured by LDH was assessed in the laboratory and was not affected by 
investigator/patient knowledge of treatment assignment. Because the trial was actively 
controlled, reduced haemolysis was anticipated in complement inhibitor-naïve patients in Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-301. Little or no change in haemolysis as measured by LDH was anticipated in 
the eculizumab-experienced patients in Study ALXN1210-PNH-302, as they were required to 
have stable LDH levels at study entry. 
o  Transfusion was guided by pre-specified protocol criteria consistent with medical practice (eg, 
laboratory and, if present, clinical evidence of anemia requiring transfusion). Patients who fulfilled 
the protocol-specified haemoglobin criteria for transfusion were considered as having received a 
transfusion regardless of whether a transfusion was administered by the investigator. 
Statistical methods 
In both studies the following efficacy analysis populations were considered: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS included all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomized 
treatment (ALXN1210 or eculizumab) and had at least 1 efficacy assessment after the first infusion of 
randomized treatment (the last statement on at least 1 efficacy assessment after the first infusion were 
not considered for ALXN1210-PNH-302 study). In the FAS, patients were compared for efficacy according 
to the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually 
received.  
Per Protocol Set (PP Set): The PP Set included all patients in the FAS who met the following criteria: 
Missed 0 doses of ALXN1210 or no more than 1 dose of eculizumab during the 26-week Primary 
Evaluation Period; Met inclusion criterion:  
−  Documented diagnosis of PNH, confirmed by high sensitivity flow cytometry 
evaluation (Borowitz, 2010) of RBCs and white blood cells (WBCs), with 
granulocyte or monocyte clone size of ≥l5%. 
−  Presence of 1 or more of the following PNH-related signs or symptoms within 
3 months of screening: fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness 
of breath (dyspnea), anemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dL), history of a major 
adverse vascular event (MAVE, including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile 
dysfunction; or history of pRBC transfusion due to PNH. 
− 
Lactate dehydrogenase level ≥ 1.5 × ULN at screening. 
Did not meet exclusion criterion:  
−  Current or previous treatment with a complement inhibitor. 
−  Platelet count < 30,000/mm3 (30 × 109/L) at screening. 
−  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/μL (0.5 × 109/L) at screening.

−  History of bone marrow transplantation. 
Non-inferiority Design  
The ravulizumab Phase 3 studies used a non-inferiority design to compare results in patients treated with 
ravulizumab to those in patients treated with eculizumab.  
Efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, the primary efficacy population. The co-primary/primary 
efficacy endpoint analyses, as well as key secondary endpoint analyses, were repeated using the PP Set 
as a sensitivity analysis. 
Co-primary efficacy analyses: For the co-primary endpoint of TA, a between-treatment difference in 
percentage of patients achieving TA was calculated along with a 95% CI for the difference using the 
stratified Newcombe CI method. This difference was computed using a weighted combination of the 
differences between treatment groups within the 6 stratification groups using Mantel-Haenszel weights. 
Patients who withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy during the Primary Evaluation Period were 
considered as nonresponders and counted as requiring transfusions. For patients who withdrew for any 
other reason during this period, their data up to the time of withdrawal were used to assess TA.  
For analysis of the co-primary endpoint of LDH-N, a generalized estimating equation approach was used 
to provide odds ratios and 95% CI. Day 29 through 183 (Week 26) LDH-N was used as the dependent 
variable and explanatory variables included an indicator variable for treatment; history of transfusion, 
which was a categorical variable based on the stratification factor level; and baseline LDH level, which was 
a continuous variable.  
Key secondary efficacy analyses: Percent change in LDH and change in FACIT-Fatigue from baseline to 
Week 26 were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical 
effects of treatment, the stratification randomization indicators of transfusion history and screening LDH 
levels, study visit and study visit by treatment group interaction as well as the continuous, fixed covariate 
of baseline FACIT-Fatigue (or LDH). For percent change in LDH, the baseline LDH level as a continuous 
variable was included. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of 
freedom. A difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups along with a 2-sided 
95% CI was calculated. For BTH and stabilized haemoglobin, the same approach used for TA was 
employed. These key secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner provided that 
noninferiority was declared for the co-primary endpoints. 
When performing the analyses for the key secondary efficacy endpoints, a closed-testing procedure was 
used so that the lack of significance of a test precluded assessment of subsequent tests. Estimates and 
CIs were computed for all these key secondary efficacy endpoints irrespective of whether a lack of 
significance of a test precluded assessment of subsequent tests. 
1. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in the percentage change from Baseline to Week 26 in LDH is less than the noninferiority margin 
(NIM) of 20%, then ALXN1210 would be declared noninferior for this parameter and the next parameter 
would be tested. 
2. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue is greater than the NIM of -5, then ALXN1210 would be 
declared noninferior for this parameter and the next parameter would be tested. 
3. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in the proportion of patients with BTH is less than the NIM of 20%, then ALXN1210 would be 
declared noninferior for this parameter and the next parameter would be tested.

4. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in the proportion of patients with stabilized haemoglobin is greater than the NIM of -20%, then 
ALXN1210 would be declared noninferior for this parameter. 
If noninferiority was established for all key secondary endpoints, then superiority was assessed using a 
closed-testing procedure with the following order and using a 2-sided 0.05 test of significance for each 
parameter.

6. Percentage change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in LDH

8. Change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in FACIT-Fatigue 
9. Proportion of patients with stabilized haemoglobin through Day 183 (Week 26) 
10. Transfusion avoidance 
Due to the hierarchical testing order being pre-specified, no adjustment of the type I error was required. 
Other secondary efficacy analyses were summarized with only descriptive statistics.

Participant flow - ALXN1210-PNH-301 
Figure 8: Disposition of Patients – Primary Evaluation Period (All Randomized Patients) 
All 246 treated patients (125 patients in the ALXN1210 group and 121 patients in the eculizumab group) 
were included in the FAS and Safety Set. 
Two patients were excluded from the PP Set. One patient in the ALXN1210 group and 1 patient in the 
eculizumab group met the protocol-specified criteria for pRBC transfusion (haemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dL) but 
were not transfused at that time or at any other time during the Primary Evaluation Period. Although other

patients met the transfusion criteria at a particular visit but did not receive a transfusion, these patients 
were included in the PP Set because they received at least 1 transfusion according to the transfusion 
criteria. 
Table 17: Analysis Data Sets (All Randomized Patients) 
There were no differences in the actual stratification at the time of randomization compared to the 
observed stratification for the LDH groups (LDH 1.5 to < 3×ULN versus LDH ≥ 3×ULN). Of the 44 patients 
stratified to 0 unit of pRBCs, 1 patient was observed to have received 1 to 14 unit(s) of pRBCs. Of the 157 
patients stratified to 1 to 14 unit(s) of pRBCs, 3 patients were observed to have received > 14 units of 
pRBCs. Of the 45 patients stratified to > 14 units unit of pRBCs, 1 patient was observed to have received 
1 to 14 unit(s) of pRBCs.

Endpoints – Primary Evaluation Period (Full Analysis Set) 
Note: The red triangle indicates the noninferiority margin. For TA, Diff (95% CI) was based on estimated differences in 
percent with 95% CI. For endpoints LDH-PCHG, BTH, and HGB-S, Diff (95% CI) were based on estimated differences 
in percent with 95% CI. For LDH-N, adjusted prevalence within each treatment was displayed. To calculate the LDH-N 
odds ratio of ravulizumab relative  to  eculizumab from  the  displayed  adjusted  prevalence  rates,  divide  the odds  of 
LDH-N on ravulizumab (0.536/[1-0.536]) by the odds of LDH-N on eculizumab (0.494/[1-0.494]).  
For  FACIT-Fatigue,  Diff  (95% CI)  were  based  on  estimated  differences  in  change  from  baseline  with  95%  CI. 
Treatment difference was estimated for ravulizumab - eculizumab except for LDH-PCHG and BTH where treatment 
difference is displayed as eculizumab - ravulizumab for consistency.

Co-primary Endpoints 
Transfusion Avoidance Per Protocol Specified Guidelines (non-inferiority analysis) 
In  Study  ALXN1210-PNH-301,  73.6%  of  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  and  66.1%  in  the 
eculizumab group avoided pRBC transfusion. The difference between the ravulizumab and eculizumab 
treatment groups in the percentage of patients who avoided transfusion was 6.8% (95% CI: -4.66%, 
18.14%). The lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than the protocol-specified NIM of -20%. Results 
from the primary analysis using the PP Set were consistent with those of the FAS, as were results from 
other sensitivity analyses. 
Patients  who  fulfilled  the  protocol-specified  transfusion  criteria  were  analyzed  as  having  received  a 
transfusion, regardless of whether the patients had actually received a transfusion. This analysis includes 
1 patient in the ravulizumab group and 1 patient in the eculizumab group who met the protocol-specified 
criteria for pRBC transfusion (haemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dL) but were not transfused at that time or at any other 
time during the Primary Evaluation Period.

LDH Normalization (non-inferiority analysis) 
The adjusted prevalence of LDH-N (LDH levels ≤ 1 × ULN from Day 29 through Day 183) was 0.536 for the 
ravulizumab group and 0.494 for the eculizumab group. The adjusted odds ratio for the comparison of 
ravulizumab to eculizumab was 1.187 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.796, 1.769). The lower bound of 
the 95% CI was greater than the protocol-specified NIM of 0.39. 
Results from the primary analysis using the PP Set were consistent with those of the FAS, as were results

An  improvement  of  ≥  3  points  in  FACIT-Fatigue  score,  considered  to  be  a  clinically  meaningful 
improvement  (Cella,  2002;  Webster,  2003),  was  observed  at  Day  8  in  45.6%  of  ravulizumab-treated 
patients  and  43.0%  of  eculizumab-treated patients.  This  improvement  of  ≥ 3 points  in  FACIT-Fatigue

Analysis of Patients Who Experienced Breakthrough Haemolysis 
Each  event  of  BTH  was  reviewed  in  an  effort  to  evaluate  the  etiological  factors  involved,  including 
time-matched PD parameters and/or presence of a potential infection or other complement amplifying 
condition  (CAC),  eg,  trauma,  surgery,  or  pregnancy  (Brodsky,  2017;  Risitano,  2012;  Sharma,  2015). 
Breakthrough haemolysis associated with suboptimal PD was defined as free C5 ≥ 0.5 μg/mL. Adverse 
events temporally associated with the onset of BTH were also reviewed for each patient to evaluate for 
potential infections or other CAC. 
In  Study  ALXN1210-PNH-301,  18  patients  experienced  BTH  during  the  Primary  Evaluation  Period:  5 
ravulizumab-treated patients experienced 1 event each and 13 eculizumab-treated patients had a total of 
15 events. There was no clear pattern in the length of time elapsed from initiation of treatment to onset 
of  BTH;  the  earliest  BTH  event  occurred  at  Day  43  in  the  eculizumab  group  and  at  Day  71  in  the 
ravulizumab group. None of the 5 BTH events in the ravulizumab group was associated with suboptimal 
C5  inhibition  (free  C5  ≥  0.5  μg/mL),  whereas  7  of  the  15  BTH  events  in  the  eculizumab  group  were 
associated  with  suboptimal  C5  inhibition.  Infection  was  associated  with  4  of  the  5  BTH  events  in  the 
ravulizumab  group  and  6  of  the  15  BTH  events  in  the  eculizumab  group  (including  2  events  also

was identified.

Breakthrough haemolysis (superiority analysis) 
Breakthrough haemolysis was the first endpoint to be tested for superiority. A trend in favor of ALXN1210 
was observed for BTH (ALXN1210: 4.0% [95% CI: 0.6%, 7.4%]; eculizumab: 10.7% [95% CI: 5.2%, 
16.3%]).  In  the  assessment  of  the  results  for  superiority,  an  approximate  p-value  was  sought  to 
understand how close the results were to meeting statistical significance. To calculate the p-value, the CI 
from the pre-specified analytic approach was inverted to solve for the type 1 error that would result in the 
observed CI that just excluded 0. This resulted in p = 0.0558. Since the difference did not reach statistical 
significance for superiority (p < 0.05), no further testing was conducted.

Other Secondary Endpoints 
EORTC QLQ-C30  
An improvement of ≥ 10 points in the 3 subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 is considered to indicate a 
clinically meaningful improvement (King, 1996; Osoba, 1998). The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health 
Status  subscale  scores  at  baseline  were  56.13%  for  the  ravulizumab  group  and  57.51%  for  the 
eculizumab  group.  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  had  at  least  a  10  point 
improvement in the Global Health Status, Physical Functioning, and Fatigue subscale scores at Day 29 
and throughout the Primary Evaluation Period compared with the eculizumab group. 
The mean Time to LDH Normalization; median time to first LDH-N was 24 days (95% CI: 22, 29) for the 
ravulizumab group and 29 days (95% CI: 24, 43) for the eculizumab group. The time to LDH-N was 5 
days shorter for the ravulizumab group. 
Total Number of pRBC Units Transfused; The majority of the complement inhibitor-naïve patients 
(82.5%) in Study ALXN1210 PNH 301 were transfusion dependent at study entry (ie, had received 1 or 
more transfusions in the year prior to study entry). During the Primary Evaluation Period, the total 
number of units transfused was lower in ravulizumab-treated patients compared with eculizumab-treated 
patients.

Treatments 
During  the  26-week  Primary  Evaluation  Period,  the  following  treatments  were  administered  via  IV 
infusion:  
• ALXN1210 treatment group: weight-based loading dose on Day 1 (2 weeks after the patient’s last dose 
of eculizumab) followed by q8w weight-based maintenance doses on Days 15, 71, and 127  
• Eculizumab treatment group: q2w 900 mg maintenance doses on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 
113, 127, 141, 155, and 169  
ALXN1210 Dosages for the Primary Evaluation Period

After completion of all assessments on Day 183 of the Primary Evaluation Period, all patients had the 
opportunity to enter an Extension Period and receive ALXN1210 until product registration or approval (in 
accordance with country-specific regulations) or for up to 2 years, whichever occurred first.  
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
• 
to  assess  the  non-inferiority  of  ALXN1210  compared  to  eculizumab  in  adult  patients  with 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who were clinically stable after having been treated 
with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months.  
Non-inferiority would be claimed if after 26 weeks of treatment the upper bound of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference (ALXN1210 – eculizumab) in percent change in lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) level was less than 15%.  
Secondary objective:   
•  To characterize the safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 in patients who switched from 
eculizumab to ALXN1210  
•  To evaluate the efficacy of ALXN1210 by additional efficacy measures  
•  To 
characterize 
the  pharmacokinetics 
(PK)/  pharmacodynamics 
(PD)  and 
immunogenicity of ALXN1210

• Proportion of patients experiencing MAVEs from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26)  
Sample size 
Approximately 192 patients were planned to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue on 
eculizumab (N = 96) or switch to ALXN1210 (N = 96) to ensure at least 172 evaluable patients (assumes 
no more than a 10% dropout rate). The sample size estimation was based on a non-inferiority design 
comparing patients in the ALXN1210 group to patients in the eculizumab group. The primary endpoint of 
haemolysis as directly measured by percent change in LDH from baseline through Day 183 was used to 
assess non-inferiority. 
For the primary endpoint of percent change in LDH from baseline to Day 183, using a non-inferiority 
margin (NIM) of 15% and a type I error of 1-sided 2.5%, and an SD of 30%, a minimum of 172 patients 
would be expected to provide 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of ALXN1210 to eculizumab. This 
margin was based on data from Alexion’s PNH Registry. For patients who discontinued eculizumab, the 
mean percent change in LDH was +134% and represents the loss of benefit relative to patients who 
remained on eculizumab, whose change in LDH is expected to remain stable. Preserving 50% of the 
benefit would give a margin of 67%; however, the more conservative and clinically appropriate margin of 
15% was selected to preserve a more substantial amount of treatment effect (89%). 
Thus, adjusting for a possible 10% dropout rate, approximately 192 patients were planned to be enrolled 
in this study.

Randomisation 
Patients  who  met  all  criteria  for  enrolment  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  with  ALXN1210  or 
eculizumab. Treatment group assignment was determined by a computer-generated random sequence 
using  an  interactive  voice-  or  web-response  system  (IxRS).  The  randomization  was  stratified 
randomization.  Patients  were  stratified  into  2  groups  based  on  their  transfusion  history  (received  a 
transfusion of pRBC within 12 months prior Day 1, yes or no). Patients within each of the 2 groups were 
then  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  continue  treatment  with  eculizumab  or  switch  to 
ALXN1210 during the 26-week Primary Evaluation Period. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label design. 
Statistical methods 
In both studies the following efficacy analysis populations were considered: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS included all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomized 
treatment (ALXN1210 or eculizumab) and had at least 1 efficacy assessment after the first infusion of 
randomized treatment (the last statement on at least 1 efficacy assessment after the first infusion were 
not considered for ALXN1210-PNH-302 study). In the FAS, patients were compared for efficacy according 
to the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually 
received.  
Per Protocol Set (PP Set): The PP Set included all patients in the FAS who met the following criteria: 
•  Missed 0 doses of ALXN1210 or no more than 1 dose of eculizumab during the 26-week 
Primary Evaluation Period 
•  Met inclusion criterion: in ALXN1210-PNH-302 
−  Treated with eculizumab according to the labelled dosing recommendation 
for PNH for at least 6 months prior to Day 1.  
− 
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level recommendation for PNH for at least 6 
months prior to Day 1 eculizumab dosing day prior to dose administration (ie, 
at trough eculizumab level) and analyzed by the central laboratory.

−  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/μL (0.5 × 109/L) at screening  
•  Never received the wrong randomized treatment 
• 
Followed the protocol-specified transfusion guidelines 
Non-inferiority Design  
The ravulizumab Phase 3 studies used a non-inferiority design to compare results in patients treated with 
ravulizumab to those in patients treated with eculizumab.  
Efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, the primary efficacy population. The co-primary/primary 
efficacy endpoint analyses, as well as key secondary endpoint analyses, were repeated using the PP Set 
as a sensitivity analysis. 
Primary efficacy analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in LDH from baseline to 
Day 183. Baseline was defined as the average of all assessments analyzed by the central laboratory prior 
to first study drug administration.  
The percent change in LDH was analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction as 
well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline LDH and the stratification randomization indicator of 
pRBC transfusion history (yes/no within 12 months prior to Day 1). A difference in percent change in LDH 
between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups along with a 2-sided 95% CI was calculated.  
Key secondary efficacy analyses: The key secondary endpoints of proportion of patients with BTH, change 
from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue, proportion of patients with transfusion avoidance, and proportion of 
patients with stabilized haemoglobin were summarized by treatment group. A difference in the 
percentage of patients with BTH in the 2 treatment groups was calculated, along with a 95% CI for the 
difference using the stratified Newcombe CI method. This difference was computed using a weighted 
combination of the differences between treatment groups within the stratification indicator of transfusion 
history using Mantel-Haenszel weights. If the stratified Newcombe method failed to provide estimates of 
CIs, the exact common risk difference method would be utilized in computing the CIs. The same approach 
was employed for TA and for stabilized haemoglobin. For change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue, the 
same approach used for the primary endpoint was employed.  
The key secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner provided that noninferiority was 
declared for the primary endpoint. When performing the analyses for the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints, a closed-testing procedure was used so that the lack of significance of a test precludes 
assessment of subsequent tests. Estimates and CIs were computed for all these key secondary efficacy 
endpoints irrespective of whether a lack of significance of a test precludes assessment of subsequent 
tests.

1. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in the proportion of patients with BTH is less than the noninferiority margin (NIM) of 20%, then 
ALXN1210 would be declared noninferior for this parameter and the next parameter would be tested.  
2. If the lower-bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue is greater than the NIM of -3, then ALXN1210 would be 
declared noninferior for this parameter and the next parameter would be tested.  
3. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups for TA is greater than the NIM of -20%, then ALXN1210 would be declared noninferior to 
eculizumab and the next parameter would be tested.  
4. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups in the proportion of patients with stabilized haemoglobin is greater than the NIM of -20%, then 
ALXN1210 would be declared noninferior for this parameter.  
If noninferiority was established for all key secondary endpoints and a larger effect for ALXN1210 was 
observed, then superiority was assessed using a closed-testing procedure with the following order and 
using a 2-sided 0.05 test for each parameter:  
5. Percent change in LDH from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26)  
6. Change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in FACIT-Fatigue  
7. Proportion of patients with BTH through Day 183 (Week 26)  
8. Proportion of patients with stabilized haemoglobin through Day 183 (Week 26)  
9. Transfusion avoidance  
Due to the hierarchical testing order being pre-specified, no adjustment of the type I error was required. 
Other secondary efficacy analyses were summarized with only descriptive statistics.

Three differences in the actual stratification at the time of randomization compared to the observed 
stratification for transfusion history occurred in this study. Of the 24 patients stratified to transfusion 
history “Yes”, 1 patient was determined to have no history of transfusion. Of the 173 patients stratified as 
transfusion history “No”, 2 patients had a history of transfusion. 
In Study ALXN1210-PNH-302, 195 eculizumab-experienced patients were treated with ravulizumab or 
eculizumab; 191 completed the Primary Evaluation Period and 4 patients (1 in the ravulizumab group and 
3 in the eculizumab group) prematurely discontinued study drug. All 191 patients who completed the 
Primary Evaluation Period entered the Extension Phase of the study.

Baseline data 
Table 38: Demographics Characteristics (Full Analysis Set) Study ALXN1210-PNH-302 
In the total population, mean age at PNH diagnosis was 35.5 years, with first (non-study) eculizumab 
infusion received at mean age 42 years. The mean time from PNH diagnosis to informed consent was 12.2 
years (median = 9.8 years). On average, patients had 5.8 years of prior eculizumab therapy. Mean (SD) 
LDH  value  at  baseline  was  231.64  (49.222)  U/L.  All  patients  had  PNH  diagnosis  confirmed  by  flow 
cytometry at Screening to quantify the percentage of PNH cells (clone size) in the peripheral blood. The 
mean total PNH RBC clone size was 60.05%, mean total PNH granulocyte clone size was 83.30%, and the 
mean total PNH monocyte clone size was 85.86%.

In  this  study  population  of  patients  with  stable  disease,  12.8%  of  patients  had  a  history  of  pRBC 
transfusions in the year prior to first dose of study drug. The mean number of transfusions within 1 year 
prior to first dose was higher in the ALXN1210 group than in the eculizumab group, as was the mean

the ALXN1210 group (one patient 16 transfusions and another patient 17 transfusions). 
Table 40: Red Blood Cell Transfusions Within 12 Months Prior to First Dose (Full Analysis Set) 
Based on available medical history, the majority (95.4%) of patients had documented PNH-associated 
conditions that were diagnosed at any time prior to informed consent. Of note, 37.4% of patients had a 
history  of  aplastic  anemia,  9.2%  of  patients  had  a  history  of  renal  failure,  and  4.6%  of  patients  had

At baseline, mean LDH values in these previously eculizumab-treated patients were within normal range 
at 228.01 U/L and 235.22 U/L for the ravulizumab and eculizumab groups, respectively. The LS estimate 
of the mean percent change in LDH showed a decrease of less than 1% (-0.82% [SEM = 3.033%]) for the 
ravulizumab group and an increase of greater than 8% (8.39% [SEM = 3.041%]) for the eculizumab 
group with a treatment difference (ravulizumab - eculizumab) of -9.21% (95% CI: -18.84%, 0.42%). 
The upper bound of the 95% CI of 0.42% was less than the protocol-specified NIM of 15%.

None of the patients in the ravulizumab group experienced BTH during the Primary Evaluation Period 
compared with 5 (5.1%) patients in the eculizumab group. The difference between treatment groups in 
the proportion of patients who experienced BTH was -5.1% (95% CI: - 18.99%, 8.89%).

Analysis of Patients Who Experienced Breakthrough Haemolysis 
In Study ALXN1210-PNH-302, 5 patients in the eculizumab group had events of BTH during the Primary 
Evaluation Period; 4 patients had 1 BTH event each, and 1 patient had 3 BTH events and discontinued 
from the study due to lack of efficacy after the third event of BTH caused hospitalization. There was no 
clear pattern in the length of time elapsed from initiation of treatment to onset of BTH. 
Four of the 7 BTH events in the eculizumab group were associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (free C5 
≥ 0.5 μg/mL) indicating immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition had not been achieved. 
Infection was associated with 3 of the 7 BTH events in the eculizumab group (including 1 event also

FACIT-Fatigue (Non-inferiority analysis) 
At baseline, mean FACIT-Fatigue total scores were 42.54 for ravulizumab and 40.69 for eculizumab. Both 
treatment groups showed improvement in FACIT-Fatigue over time, with less fatigue in the ravulizumab 
group compared to the eculizumab group at all-time points following Day 8. At Day 183, the LS mean 
(SEM) change in FACIT-Fatigue total score was 2.01 (0.697) for ravulizumab and 0.54 (0.704) for 
eculizumab. The LS mean difference between treatment groups was 1.47 (95% CI: -0.21, 3.15). The 
lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than the protocol specified NIM of -3.

Transfusion Avoidance Per Protocol Specified Guidelines (Non-inferiority analysis) 
Patients who fulfilled the protocol-specified transfusion criteria were analyzed as having received a 
transfusion, regardless of whether the patients had actually received a transfusion. This analysis includes 
2 patients in the ravulizumab group and 3 patients in the eculizumab group who met the 
protocol-specified criteria for pRBC transfusion (haemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dL) but were not transfused at that 
time or at any other time during the Primary Evaluation Period.   
During the Primary Evaluation Period, 87.6% of patients in the ravulizumab group and 82.7% in the 
eculizumab group avoided pRBC transfusion. The difference between the ravulizumab and eculizumab 
treatment groups in the percentage of patients who avoided transfusion was 5.5% (95% CI: - 4.27%, 
15.68%). The lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than the protocol specified NIM of 20%. The 
treatment difference was consistent when TA was analyzed independent of protocol-specified transfusion 
guidelines. Results using the PP Set were consistent with those of the FAS.

Percent change from baseline in LDH (Superiority analysis) 
Because statistically significant noninferiority was achieved for the primary endpoint and all 4 key 
secondary endpoints, the pre-specified hierarchical order continued with superiority testing of percent 
change from baseline in LDH. The assessment of the treatment difference for superiority resulted in 
p-value = 0.0583 which did not reach the pre-specified significance threshold for superiority (p < 0.05) 
and therefore no additional superiority testing was conducted.

LDH Normalization  
In Study ALXN1210 PNH 302, LDH-N was achieved at Day 183 by 64 of 97 (66.0%) patients treated with 
ravulizumab and 58 of 98 (59.2%) patients treated with eculizumab. 
The adjusted odds ratio from the generalized estimating equation model excluding baseline LDH as an 
explanatory variable for the comparison of ravulizumab to eculizumab was 1.179 (95% CI: 0.737, 1.887) 
indicating a patient switching to ravulizumab has a nearly 18% increased probability of achieving LDH-N 
compared to a patient who remains on eculizumab. The adjusted rate of LDH-N post first study drug 
infusion through Day 183 for ravulizumab was 0.608 (95% CI: 0.508, 0.700) and for eculizumab was 
0.568 (95% CI: 0.467, 0.664). 
EORTC QLQ-C30  
In Study ALXN1210 PNH 302, mean EORTC QLQ-C30 subscale scores at baseline for both treatment 
groups reflected a patient population with stable disease: Global Health Status and Physical Functioning 
subscale scores were ranging from 69% to 88% across treatment groups, and Fatigue subscale scores 
were ranging from 25% to 26%. Changes in scores during the study were not notable in either treatment 
group. Similar percentages of patients in the ravulizumab group had at least a 10 point improvement in 
the Global Health Status, Physical Functioning, and Fatigue subscale scores at each assessment during 
the Primary Evaluation Period compared with the eculizumab group.

CONCLUSION 
Statistically significant non-inferiority was achieved for both co-primary and 
all  4  key  secondary  endpoints.  Both  co-primary  and  all  4  key  secondary 
endpoints had point estimates which favored ravulizumab over eculizumab. 
Superiority testing was assessed following a prespecified hierarchical order 
that  began  with  breakthrough  haemolysis  endpoint.  The  treatment 
difference 
favouring 
for  breakthrough  haemolysis  (p  =  0.0558 
ravulizumab) did not reach the prespecified threshold for superiority (p < 
0.05), and no further superiority testing of other endpoints was conducted. 
For both coprimary endpoints and all 4 key secondary efficacy endpoints, 
ALXN1210  achieved  statistically  significant  noninferiority  compared  to 
eculizumab, with treatment differences favouring ALXN1210. Compared to 
eculizumab,  ALXN1210  provided  better  disease  control  as  evidenced  by 
immediate,  complete,  and  sustained  inhibition  of  terminal  complement 
throughout the entire 26-week treatment period.

Results and Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in LDH from baseline to Day 183.  
Baseline was defined as the average of all assessments analyzed by the central laboratory prior to 
first study drug administration. 
The percent change in LDH was analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with  the  fixed,  categorical  effects  of  treatment,  study  visit,  and  study  visit  by  treatment  group 
interaction  as  well  as  the  continuous,  fixed  covariate  of  baseline  LDH  and  the  stratification 
randomization  indicator  of  pRBC  transfusion  history  (yes/no  within  12  months  prior  to  Day  1).  A 
difference in percent change in LDH between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups along 
with a 2-sided 95% CI was calculated.

(67.00, 84.02) 
(-10.41, 13.31) 
Statistically significant non-inferiority was achieved for both the primary and 
all  4  key  secondary  endpoints.  Both  the  primary  and  all  4  key  secondary 
endpoints had point estimates which favoured ravulizumab over eculizumab. 
Superiority  testing  was  assessed  following  a  prespecified  hierarchical  order 
that began with percent change from baseline in LDH. The assessment of the 
treatment difference for superiority resulted in a p-value = 0.0583 favouring 
ravulizumab. The prespecified threshold for superiority (p < 0.05) for percent 
change  from  baseline  in  LDH  was  not  reached,  and  no  further  superiority 
testing was conducted. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the observed stratification variable of 
transfusion history and for sex, race, region, and age for the primary endpoint 
and key secondary endpoints. No sensitive subgroups were identified in these 
analyses. The point estimates for all subgroups favoured ALXN1210. 
For  the  primary  endpoint  and  all  4  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints, 
ALXN1210  achieved  statistically  significant  non-inferiority  compared  to 
eculizumab,  with  treatment  differences  consistently  favouring  ALXN1210. 
Compared  to  eculizumab,  ALXN1210  provided  better  disease  control  as 
evidenced  by  complete  and  sustained  inhibition  of  terminal  complement 
throughout the entire 26-week treatment period with no events of BTH. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
There were no pooled or integrated analyses performed since the two Phase 3 studies enrolled different 
patient populations (naïve vs pre-treated patients).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Four  Phase  I  studies  were  conducted  in  healthy  volunteer  to  collect  data  on  safety,  tolerability, 
immunogenicity, PK and PD. A Phase 1b and a Phase 2 dose escalation studies were conducted for dose

selection in patients with PNH who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment. Phase 1 and Phase 2 
study designs (ALXN1210-PNH-103 and ALXN1210-PNH-201) were acceptable to provide the necessary 
additional data to understand the drug and to design the confirmatory trials. Size, number and range of 
studied  doses  seem  correct  for  the  best  starting  choice  for  phase  3  studies.  Results  of  those  studies 
suggest that ALXN1210 was well tolerated and resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction of plasma LDH 
levels together with an improvement on LDH, free haemoglobin and QoL. However, efficacy and safety 
data from only those studies are quite limited to properly justify dose selection. Therefore, dose selection 
is mainly based on modelling and simulation methods that utilized the Phase 1 and Phase 2 PK, PD, and 
LDH data over a wide range of doses and regimens in healthy volunteers and patients with PNH (see 
Pharmacology section).  
No  modification  of  this  dosing  regimen  was  proposed  for  any  special  populations  or  demographic 
subgroups. According to the applicant it is expected ravulizumab is metabolized as any endogenous IgG 
(degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways), with a similar elimination, thus no 
dose adjustment is deemed necessary in patients with renal impairment. Regarding hepatic impairment, 
a  statement  that  safety  and  efficacy  of  Ultomiris  have  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. It should be also highlighted that according to 
the SmPC, ravulizumab dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary by ±  7 days of the scheduled 
infusion day (except for the first maintenance dose of ravulizumab) but the subsequent dose should be 
administered according to the original schedule. The delay in ≤7 days from the targeted dosing day seems 
not relevant for the outcome of the patient. However, there are very limited data on a longer delay; any 
further information available will be provided once the maintenance period is concluded (see RMP). The 
MAH will submit data once the studies are completed [ALXN1210-PNH-301 (estimated Dec 2023) and 
ALXN1210-PNH-302 (Dec 2021)] (see RMP). 
Two multicenter, open-label, randomised, active-controlled, Phase 3 studies ─ ALXN1210-PNH-301 and 
ALXN1210-PNH-302─  were  conducted  as  pivotal  studies.  Open-label  design  seems  reasonable  due  to 
marked  differences  in  IV  infusion  schedules  and  high  number  of  sham  IV  infusion  required  as 
consequence for a blinded trial. 
One  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  PNH  who  were  naïve  to  complement  inhibitor  treatment 
(ALXN1210-PNH-301) and other in patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated 
with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months (ALXN1210-PNH-302). ALXN1210 has been planned as a 
possible fist line treatment as an alternative to eculizumab, as a continuation therapy after eculizumab or 
as a maintenance therapy due to the 2 years of continuation treatment. 
These  populations  represent  the  patients  who  could  benefit  from  receiving  ravulizumab  in  clinical 
practice. The populations were characterized differently in so far as naïve patients have active haemolytic 
disease and the patients on eculizumab have stable disease. Therefore, inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and efficacy endpoints were slightly different in both studies.  
The  proposed  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  considered  acceptable  in  both  studies.  It  should  be 
noted that patients who have been treated with eculizumab and who do not achieve stable disease are 
excluded from both trials. No option has been given for patients with active disease after eculizumab or 
non-responding patients. So those patients who have not responded to eculizumab may not be potential 
candidates to receive ravulizumab as rescue therapy, unless complementary studies or a long follow-up 
of the pre-treated population indicate otherwise. 
For Study ALXN1210 PNH 301, the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and LDH normalization 
allowed  optimal  characterization  of  the  magnitude  of  effect  in  patients  who  were  complement 
inhibitor-naïve  and  had  active  PNH  disease.  In  contrast,  for  Study  ALXN1210  PNH-302,  the  primary 
endpoint of change in LDH allowed optimal characterization of the maintenance of the high degree of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 93/128 
 
 
 
disease control that patients had already achieved at baseline after a minimum of 6 months of eculizumab 
treatment.  
Apart from breakthrough haemolysis, all of the proposed primary and secondary endpoints were in line 
with endpoints used in the eculizumab studies (TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD studies).   
Thrombosis  has  been  well-recognized  as  the  leading  cause  of  death  in  PNH.  Major  vascular  events, 
including thrombosis, have been discussed in safety section.  
For  all  above,  the  proposed  primary/co-primary  endpoints  and  secondary  endpoints  are  considered 
acceptable since they have been properly justified by the applicant. Both studies consists of a 4-week 
Screening Period, a 26-week Randomized Treatment Period, and an Extension Period of up to 2 years. The 
26-weeks  treatment  duration  is  considered  acceptable  since  is  in  line  with  eculizumab  clinical 
development and 6 months seems to be sufficient to characterize the comparison between ravulizumab 
and eculizumab. However, it should be kept in mind that only the loading dose and 3 dose of maintenance 
can  be  properly  assessed.  The  3rd  maintenance  dose  will  be  administered  on  week  18  and  the  4th 
maintenance dose will be administered on week 26 without time for follow-up. Applicant´s proposal to 
provide  the  final  results  from  the  extension  periods  as  a  post-approval  commitment  is  acceptable. 
Nevertheless,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  any  additional  data  available  (PD,  efficacy  and 
safety). Data up to week 52 (data cut-off date 04 Sep 2018),  showed that although most of the cases 
adequately maintain the response, there is an escape of LDH values in certain subjects over time, which 
does not correlate with C5 levels, and which should be confirmed in terms of clinical relevance with a 
longer follow-up. 
PNH has a high risk for significant morbidity and mortality in untreated patients, so that placebo controls 
were not considered acceptable for use as a comparator in the ravulizumab PNH clinical studies. Patients 
in the Phase 3 studies were randomly assigned to active treatment, either ravulizumab or eculizumab 
(since 2007, the PNH standard of care). Eculizumab has been administered in both studies according to 
the SmPC. The choice of comparator for both target population and doses used seem to be adequate. 
In both studies randomization has been 1:1. The stratified factors (transfusion history and/or screening 
LDH levels) are reasonable since they are considered relevant prognostic factors. . Regarding sensitivity 
analysis (splitting the 1-14 level into two levels [1-4 and 4-14]), the level 4 to 14 units includes a group 
of  patients  with  extremely  heterogeneous  transfusion  dependence.  However,  it  does  not  seem  to  be 
clinically relevant to continue to pursue this discussion.  
The  two  Phase  3  studies  used  a  non-inferiority  design  to  compare  results  in  patients  treated  with 
ravulizumab to those in patients treated with eculizumab. The endpoints were tested in hierarchical order 
for  non-inferiority.  Additional  testing  order  for  superiority  is  also  pre-specified  if  non-inferiority  was 
established for all key secondary endpoints. 
Efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  the  FAS  as  the  primary  efficacy  population.  The 
co-primary/primary  efficacy  endpoint  analyses,  as  well  as  key  secondary  endpoint  analyses,  were 
repeated using the PP Set as a sensitivity analysis. However, it should be noted that in non-inferiority 
studies PP set is preferred as primary efficacy population. In this case, in both studies FAS and PP set are 
quite similar [ALXN1210-PNH-301: FAS (ALXN1210 n= 125; Eculizumab n=121); PP (ALXN1210 n= 124; 
Eculizumab n=120) and ALXN1210-PNH-302: FAS (ALXN1210 n= 97; Eculizumab n=98); PP (ALXN1210 
n=  93;  Eculizumab  n=93)]  and  results  in  both  population  are  in  line.  Thus,  this  issue  is  not  further 
pursued. 
In ALXN1210-PNH-301, NIMs for co-primary endpoint % transfusion avoidance is based on data from 
Alexion’s PNH Registry. According to that registry, the mean eculizumab response was 57%. The NIM was 
established as -20% which represents a preservation of 65% of effect. It should be noted that a different 
approach was submitted in the  CHMP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/403560/2016). In that case 
Assessment report

NIM  was  based  on  the  eculizumab  TRIUMPH  study,  in  which  a  difference  of  51%  in  the  proportion  of 
patients with TA after 26 weeks of treatment of eculizumab over placebo was observed and a traditional 
choice of NIM of ≤50% loss of benefit was considered. With this approach NIM resulted in 25%, although 
was highlighted by the CHMP that this NIM was not  based on the lower bound of the 95% CI  for the 
treatment difference (95%CI: 0.367 to 0.654). Using the lower bound of the 95% CI, a more conservative 
NIM resulted (18.3%). As this is not far from 20% considered with the new approach, this issue is not 
further pursued.  
NIM for co-primary endpoint LDH normalization is based on eculizumab TRIUMPH study. According to this 
study mean eculizumab response was 0.42. The NIM was established in 0.39. It should be noted this 
approach was not discussed in the scientific advice since in this one a different co-primary endpoint was 
proposed, change of LDH from baseline. The applicant has provided an explanation for the choice of the 
NIM. Even a more conservative NIM should have been chosen, taking into account the outcomes of the 
study, this discussion is no longer needed.  
In ALXN1210-PNH-302, NIM is based on data from Alexion’s PNH Registry for patients who discontinued 
eculizumab relative to patients who remained on eculizumab, whose change in LDH is expected to remain 
stable (the mean percent change in LDH was +134%) The NIM was established in 15% which represent 
a  preservation  of  89%  of  effect.  The  approach  is  accepted  as  the  preservation  of  effect  (89%)  is 
conservative. However, it has to be kept in mind that the fact that is based only on data from a registry 
is a relevant limitation. 
Considering  the  established  NIMs  for  %TA  in  ALXN1210-PNH-301  and  %  Change  in  LDH  in 
ALXN1210-PNH-302,  the  sample  size  has  been  considered  acceptable,  although  sample  size  in 
ALXN1210-PNH-301 was calculated to provide 80% power, which is minimum acceptable level of power. 
As the sample size estimate based on LDH-N was smaller than that based on TA, the final sample size 
estimate selected for ALXN1210-PNH-301 study was based on the TA endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the conducted Phase 3 studies provide evidence of data from both studies without relevant 
differences  between  treatment  groups  in  demographic  characteristics,  with  an  acceptable  treatment 
compliance  and  absence  of  key  protocol  deviations  that  impacted  interpretation  of  efficacy  results. 
Diagnostic  criteria,  adherence  to  intent  to  treat  principles,  inclusion  of  stratification  factors,  and  the 
selection of endpoints apparently have been well applied for reducing the potential for bias.  
Although no protocol deviations that impacted on interpretation of efficacy results were observed, in the 
ALXN1210-301, five patients (ALXN1210: n= 1, eculizumab: n= 4) were inadvertently assigned to the 
incorrect  stratification  group.  Moreover,  in  the  ALXN1210-302  study,  3  patients  (ALXN1210:  n=1, 
eculizumab:  n=2)  were  also  stratified  to  the  wrong  group.  However,  no  relevant  implications  were 
observed. 
In study ALXN1210-301 (Complement Inhibitor-Naïve Patients), ALXN1210 met the primary objective of 
statistically significant non-inferiority compared to eculizumab on both co-primary endpoints, avoidance 
of  pRBC  transfusion  per  protocol-specified  guidelines  [Difference  between  treatment:  6.8%  (95%  CI: 
-4.66%, 18.14%) with a lower bound of the 95% CI greater than the protocol-specified NIM of -20%] and 
LDH-N [Adjusted odds ratio for the comparison of treatment: 1.187 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.796, 
1.769) with lower bound of the 95% CI greater than the protocol-specified NIM of 0.39], from Day 29 to 
Day 183. ALXN1210 also achieved statistically significant non-inferiority compared to eculizumab on all 4 
key secondary endpoints  according to a pre-specified hierarchical testing order (1  Percentage change 
from baseline in LDH levels, 2 Change from baseline in QoL as assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale, 3 
Proportion  of  patients  with  BTH  and  4  Proportion  of  patients  with  stabilized  haemoglobin  levels).  As 
statistically  significant  non-inferiority  was  achieved  for  both  co-primary  and  all  4  key  secondary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 95/128 
 
 
 
endpoints,  superiority  was  assessed  using  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  testing  order.  However,  the 
assessment of the treatment difference for superiority in Breakthrough haemolysis resulted in p-value = 
0.0558  which  did  not  reach  the  pre-specified  significance  threshold  for  superiority  (p  <  0.05)  and 
therefore no additional superiority testing was conducted. 
In study ALXN1210-302 (Eculizumab-Experienced Patients), ALXN1210 achieved statistically significant 
non-inferiority compared to eculizumab for the primary endpoint, percent change in LDH from baseline to 
Day 183, with a treatment difference (ALXN1210 - eculizumab) of -9.21% (95% CI: -18.84%, 0.42%. 
The upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the pre-specified NIM of 15%. ALXN1210 also achieved 
statistically significant non-inferiority compared to eculizumab on all 4 key secondary endpoints according 
to  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  testing  order  for  non-inferiority  (1  Proportion  of  patients  with  BTH,  2 
Change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale, 3 Proportion of patients 
with  transfusion  avoidance  and  4  Proportion  of  patients  with  stabilized  haemoglobin  levels).  As 
statistically  significant  non-inferiority  was  achieved  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  all  4  key  secondary 
endpoints, the pre-specified hierarchical order continued with superiority testing of percent change from 
baseline in LDH. However, the assessment of the treatment difference for superiority resulted in p-value 
=  0.0583  which  did  not  reach  the  pre-specified  significance  threshold  for  superiority  (p  <  0.05)  and 
therefore no additional superiority testing was conducted.  
The first endpoint to be tested for superiority in both studies did not reach statistical significance and no 
other  superiority  test  was  performed.  So  even  when  results  apparently  show  a  favourable  trend  for 
ravulizumab for all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in both studies, superiority has not been 
achieved.  Consequently,  no  other  conclusion  apart  from  similarity  between  both  treatments  can  be 
considered.  
In  the  study  ALXN1210-PNH-301  BTH  events  where  described  in  5/125  patients  in  ravulizumab  arm 
(none with suboptimal PD) and 15/121 patients in the eculizumab arm (7/121 with suboptimal PD). In the 
eculizumab arm there were 15 patients with suboptimal PD response (none in the ravulizumab group), of 
whom 6 (40%) experienced BTH. A careful medical review of these patients with free C5 excursions > 0.5 
μg/mL revealed that several of these patients did have symptoms of BTH or elevated LDH that taken 
together did not meet the protocol-specified definition. Overall, these observations seem to suggest that 
free C5 excursions > 0.5 μg/mL may be associated with symptoms and signs of intravascular haemolysis 
that do not meet the more robust definition of breakthrough haemolysis defined in the protocols of both 
Phase 3 studies and it should be further observed if it comes with a worsened quality of life during the 
extension phase of the studies (see RMP). In this context, raises the possibility that a complete inhibition 
or blocking of C5 may not be ─from a given threshold─ so important for the control of the disease.  
In study ALXN1210 PNH 301, TA subgroups analysis is quite in line with overall analysis. There are slightly 
deviations in several subgroups (0 prior pRBC units transfused, >65 years, North America Region) but 
they  seem  to  be  led  by  small  number  of  patients  included  in  those  subgroups.  Variability  on  LDH-N 
subgroups analysis is higher than for TA. The same slightly deviation were observed in those subgroups 
with  lower  patients  (0  prior  pRBC  units  transfused,  >65  years,  North  America  and  Japan  Regions). 
Pointing out the results of female, whose OR (95%CI) was 0.66 (0.36, 1.19) while OR (95%CI) in male 
was 1.74 (0.99, 3.04). The applicant argues there is no plausible biologic explanation for an effect of 
gender on ravulizumab efficacy: The most relevant finding among male vs female baseline population 
characteristics, was the distribution of Asian subjects; the number of Japanese’s descendants was higher 
in the male group than in the female group, what is not consistent with what is observed in the Forest plot 
and that supports the explanation that basal characteristics data do not clearly identify any prognostic 
factors that could explain the observed gender-based difference in LDH-N, what leads to assume that it 
could be a random result. In study ALXN1210 PNH 302, Percent Change in LDH subgroups analysis did not 
show relevant different results for any group. Although it is suppressive the wide 95 CI observed in males, 
because number of patients included in this subgroups is quite similar to the subgroup of females.

In study ALXN1210-302, it has been described that a patient with stable disease but suboptimal response 
changing to ravulizumab has a nearly 18% increased probability of reaching LDH-N compared to a patient 
who remains with eculizumab; therefore eculizumab could be a good option for treating the first line 
(induction) and that it could be changed to ravulizumab in case of suboptimal response. Patients under 
eculizumab treatment with good control of the disease could decide on continuing with eculizumab or 
change to ravulizumab only because of more convenient dosing of the latter, where there would be a real 
benefit in the maintenance period allowing a better quality of life. Nevertheless, no data have been 
provided to confirm this statement, thus there is no evidence regarding an increased probability of 
reaching LDH-N with ravulizumab compared to a patient who remains with eculizumab. Moreover, 
according to the applicant, this statement is based on an exploratory analysis and as such cannot be 
supported. 
Across  both  phase  3  studies,  ravulizumab  showed  statistically  significant  non-inferiority  compared  to 
eculizumab, reducing and maintaining control of haemolysis in patients with PNH and suggesting that 
complement inhibitor-naïve and eculizumab-experienced patients with PNH both respond to ravulizumab 
treatment. 
The benefit/risk of continuous versus intermittent disease-driven treatment with ravulizumab would be of 
interest, given the fact that PNH is a chronic disease. In this context data about ravulizumab 
discontinuation and outcome of these patients who discontinued ravulizumab in the long term follow up 
should be submitted once the trials have been completed (See RMP). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results presented show the non-inferiority of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in complement 
inhibitor-naïve and eculizumab-experienced PNH patients, for primary endpoints and for all endpoints of 
key secondary efficacy in both Phase 3 studies.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of ravulizumab (ALXN1210) administered intravenously (IV) for the treatment of 
patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is based on 4 clinical studies: 
−  Two Phase 3 studies in patients with PNH: Study ALXN1210-PNH-301 and Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-302. In Study ALXN1210-PNH-301, 246 patients were randomized (ravulizumab, 
N = 125; eculizumab, N = 121) and in Study ALXN1210-PNH-302, 197 patients were randomized 
(ravulizumab, N = 97; eculizumab, N = 98).  
−  One Phase 1b and One Phase 2 study in patients with PNH: Study ALXN1210-PNH-103 and Study 
ALXN1210-PNH-201 A total of 39 patients received ravulizumab in the Primary Evaluation Period 
of these 2 studies (13 in Study ALXN1210-PNH-103 and 26 in Study ALXN1210-PNH-201). All 39 
patients entered the Extension Periods to continue ravulizumab treatment.

Deaths 
No deaths were reported up to the end of the 26-week Primary Evaluation Period for the Phase 3 PNH 
Population. 
One patient in the pooled eculizumab group died during the Extension Period following an AE (lung 
adenocarcinoma) that began during the Primary Evaluation Period. The patient developed symptoms of 
lung cancer (blood-tinged sputum, cough, and wheezing) during the Primary Evaluation Period and was 
diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma after entering the Extension Period. Study drug was discontinued, 
and the patient started palliative -chaemotherapy. Subsequently, the patient died due to lung 
adenocarcinoma. The investigator assessed the event to be not related to study drug.  
No deaths occurred in the PNH Extension Population up to the data cut-off. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Mean values for hematology parameters at baseline were generally similar between the ravulizumab and 
eculizumab groups in Studies ALXN1210-PNH-301 and ALXN1210-PNH-302. 
Mean haemoglobin values showed improvement or remained stable from baseline through the 26-week 
Primary Evaluation Period in both treatment groups (Figure 19). Mean platelet counts and mean 
neutrophil counts were either stable or showed small fluctuations which remained above the upper limit 
of normal (130 × 109/L and 1.8 × 109/L, respectively) in both treatment groups at all post-baseline 
study visits.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ravulizumab. Because ravulizumab, is 
a monoclonal antibody, clinically meaningful drug-drug PK interactions with small molecule drugs or other 
biologics are generally not expected. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AEs led to treatment discontinuation during the 26-week Primary Evaluation Period in the 
Phase 3 PNH Population. In one patient from the pooled eculizumab group, lung adenocarcinoma led to 
death during the Extension Period (a patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma in the Extension 
Period and study drug was discontinued). The event was assessed by the Investigator to be not related to 
study drug. 
In phase 3 PNH population, five patients had temporary interruptions due to AEs. In the pooled 
ravulizumab group (n = 2) 1 patient had infusion-related reaction with no recurrence at subsequent 
infusions and 1 patient had muscle spasms with each infusion. In the pooled eculizumab group (n = 3), 1 
patient had headache (recurrence following a reduction in the rate of infusion at subsequent dosing 
visits), and 1 each, experienced back pain and flank pain. 
Infusion interruptions due to these AEs were temporary, and all infusions were ultimately completed.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of ravulizumab in the treatment of patients with PNH is based mainly on two phase 3 
clinical trials in which ravulizumab was compared to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naïve patients 
(Study PNH-301; n=246) and in patients who were clinically stable on eculizumab treatment (Study 
PNH-302; n=195). In total, 222 patients were treated with ravulizumab in these phase 3 clinical trials and 
Assessment report

this population is considered the main safety database. Additionally, data on 39 patients from studies 
PNH-103 (a phase 1b study) and PNH-201 (a phase 2 study) have been provided, although in these 
studies ravulizumab was administered at different doses.  
Patients were treated with either ravulizumab or eculizumab for 26 weeks, with a median of infusions 
received of 4 (range: 1; 4) and 15 (range: 1; 15), in the ravulizumab and eculizumab groups, 
respectively. The majority of patients completed the 26 weeks period and only 6 patients (1 in the 
ravulizumab group and 5 in the eculizumab group) discontinued study treatment, although none of 
discontinuations were due to adverse events. Infusion interruptions were reported in 11 (5%) patients in 
the pooled ravulizumab group and 17 (7.8%) patients in the pooled eculizumab group. Adverse events 
were the leading cause of infusion interruption in 2 patients treated with ravulizumab (1 infusion-related 
reaction and 1 muscle spam) and 3 patients treated with eculizumab (1 headache, 1 back pain and 1 flank 
pain). Nevertheless, all infusion interruptions were temporary and were finally completed.  
Regarding baseline characteristics (demographic/disease) treatment groups were in general 
well-balanced, except for some imbalances in the proportion of White (41.9% pooled ravulizumab vs. 
51.1% pooled eculizumab) and Asian (42.8% pooled ravulizumab vs. 34.7% pooled eculizumab) 
patients. Median age at first infusion in the pooled ravulizumab group was 43.5 years (range: 18; 83) and 
only 26 patients (11.7%) were older than 65 years. Data on the use of ravulizumab in elderly patients are 
considered limited, especially in patients ≥ 75 years. There are no data on the use of ravulizumab in 
paediatric patients (study ALXN1210-PNH-304 in children is ongoing) nor in pregnant/lactating women. 
This information has been properly reflected in the SmPC. The overall incidence of AEs was similar 
between treatment groups (87.8% pooled ravulizumab vs. 87.2% pooled eculizumab). The most 
commonly reported AEs (≥ 10%) were headache (32% pooled ravulizumab vs. 26.0% pooled 
eculizumab), nasopharyngitis (14.4% vs. 17.4%) and upper respiratory tract infection (14.0% vs. 7.8%). 
Of the total number of AEs, 33.8% and 29.2% in both ravulizumab and eculizumab groups were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. Among these, headache was the most 
commonly reported AE in both groups (16.7% ravulizumab vs. 14.6% eculizumab). The majority of AEs 
were of grade 1 or grade 2 and a similar rate of grade 3 AEs was reported in both treatment arms (12.6% 
ravulizumab and 15.1% eculizumab). There were 7 (3.2%) patients in the ravulizumab group and 2 
(0.9%) patients in the eculizumab group that reported AEs of grade 4. The majority of events were 
related to haematology values altered and were considered by the investigator not related or unlikely 
related to study drug. In the ravulizumab group events were resolved in 3 of the 7 patients. Only one AE 
of grade 5 was reported in the eculizumab group (a patient diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma). 
No deaths were reported in the 26-week period in either treatment group. Two patients died in the 
eculizumab group during the extension study period, one of them due to a lung adenocarcinoma and the 
other one due to a pulmonary sepsis. None of these fatal AEs was considered treatment-related. 
Regarding SAEs, the incidence was similar between treatment groups (15 [6.8%] pooled ravulizumab vs. 
17 [7.8%] pooled eculizumab), although a slightly higher number of SAEs were considered related to 
study drug in the ravulizumab arm (5 [2.3%] vs. 2 [0.9%]). Overall, the most frequent SAEs, reported in 
at least 2 patients, were pyrexia (1 [0.5%] pooled ravulizumab and 5 [2.3%] eculizumab) and haemolysis 
(2 [0.9%] in the eculizumab group). Most of the events resolved, except a DVT event reported in the 
ravulizumab group and lung adenocarcinoma in the eculizumab group. SAEs considered by the 
investigator as possibly related to ravulizumab treatment include: leptospirosis, pyrexia, anaemia and left 
ventricular failure, systemic infection and SAEs of hyperthermia, epilepsy and respiratory failure reported 
in one patient in study PNH-302. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) with ravulizumab were defined according to the important 
identified risk in the eculizumab RMP, and include: infections (meningococcal infections, Aspergillus 
infections, sepsis and other serious infections), infusion reactions, serious cutaneous adverse reactions, 
cardiac disorders and angioedema. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 113/128 
 
 
 
The frequency of AESIs was similar in the ravulizumab and eculizumab pooled groups (12.2% vs. 8.2%, 
respectively), with infusion reaction as the most commonly reported AE (8.6% vs. 5.9%).  
Infections have been the most commonly reported AEs in both treatment arms. Meningococcal infection 
is an identified risk of eculizumab, which can be life-threatening and which is related to its mode of action. 
In the phase 3 studies no events of meningococcal infections/sepsis were reported; however, 3 events of 
meningococcal infection were reported in studies PNH-201 (2 events) and PNH-103 (1 event) among 
patients treated with ravulizumab. One of the events occurred at day 57, (approximately one month after 
the last infusion), while the other two events occurred during the extension study period (Day 222, 24 
days after the last dose, and Day 615, approximately 28 days after the last dose) and all of them resolved. 
The 3 patients had been properly vaccinated. All patients had received vaccines against serogroups A, C, 
Y, W 135 and B. Meningococcal infections were caused by Neisseria meningitidis serotype Y in all cases 
and additionally serotype W 135 in one of the patients the. Meningococcal infection is described in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and has been included as a safety concern in the RMP. Infections by 
Neisseria sp. others than Neisseria meningitides were not mentioned as AEs in the submitted clinical 
safety documentation. According to the Applicant, no other Neisseria sp. infections were reported from 
ravulizumab clinical studies. Nevertheless, cases of serious infections with Neisseria species other than 
Neisseria meningitidis, including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported with 
eculizumab.  
Angioedema was more common in the ravulizumab arm than in the eculizumab arm (4 [1.8%] vs. 0%, 
respectively). However, the number of subjects was very low and AEs reported within this category were 
gingival swelling after tooth extraction (n = 1) and urticaria (n = 3). . 
Major adverse vascular events were also assessed as part of the safety evaluation. Among patients 
treated with ravulizumab, 2 events of DVT (1 in study PNH-301 and 1 in study PNH-201) and 1 event of 
thrombosis (study PNH-301) were reported. In the eculizumab group 1 event of thrombosis was also 
reported.  
Immunogenicity profile of ravulizumab appears low and comparable to eculizumab. A higher number of 
patients were ADA-positive at baseline in the ravulizumab arm compared to eculizumab arm, mainly in 
study PNH-301 (eculizumab – naïve). In the ravulizumab pooled group, treatment-emergent ADA positive 
were observed in 1 patient (study PNH-301) compared to 2 patients in eculizumab group (one in each 
phase 3 study). None of ADAs were neutralizing and none showed cross-reactivity to eculizumab.  
The safety profile of ravulizumab in specific subgroups appears in general comparable to the overall 
population with no major differences in terms of AEs (all grades) and SAEs according to sex and age. 
Regarding elderly patients (> 65 years), a higher frequency of anaemia (15.4% vs. 3.1%) and 
neutropenia (11.5% vs. 3.1%) were observed with ravulizumab compared to eculizumab. Moreover, 
headache was more commonly reported in female patients treated with ravulizumab (36.4% ravulizumab 
vs. 29.4% eculizumab). Since body weigh affect ravulizumab PK, a body weight-based regimen has been 
used in the pivotal clinical trials. However, despite weight adjustment, exposure to ravulizumab was 
approximately 20% higher in patients with a lower weight (≥ 40 to < 60 kg) compared to patients with a 
medium weight (≥ 60 to < 100 kg) whereas in the highest weight patients (≥ 100 kg), exposure was 
approximately 20% lower than in patients with a medium weight (See PK). Overall, no major differences 
have been observed in terms of efficacy and safety by body weight.  
Regarding race, although within the White and the Asian race AE profile of ravulizumab and eculizumab by 
SOC was not remarkably different, some imbalances can be experienced between these two races within 
the ravulizumab-treated patient population. However, these differences do not seem relevant and do not 
suggest a different safety profile of ravulizumab between Asian and White patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 114/128 
 
 
 
Safety data of the 39 patients who were treated with ravulizumab in the extension period of studies 
PNH-103 and PNH-201, with a median of treatment duration of almost 2 years, provide additional 
information of the safety profile of ravulizumab in the long-term. In this population a higher rate of grade 
3 and grade 4 TEAEs, AEs of special interest, as well as SAEs (related and not-related) were reported, 
compared to the phase 3 studies, with the higher incidence reported during the first six months. However, 
taking into account the low number of subjects, the absence of a comparator as well as that in these 
studies ravulizumab was used at different doses, no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab appears comparable to that of eculizumab in patients with PNH 
with no major differences observed, neither in quantitative nor qualitative terms. However, considering 
the limited number of infusions received by patients in the ravulizumab group, additional data in the long 
term are deemed necessary. Additional safety data of the extension study period, up to week 52 (data 
cut-off date 04 Sep 2018), from both studies (PNH-301 and PNH-302) were submitted during the 
procedure. 
In the study PNH-301, of the 125 patients randomized to ravulizumab group, 124 patients entered the 
extension study period. In general, incidence of AEs appears to decrease over time. In the study 
PNH-302, of the 97 patients randomized to ravulizumab group, 96 patients entered the extension study 
period. In this study, while overall incidence of AEs decreased over time, an increase in the number of 
Grade 3 AEs was observed (7.2% Period 1 [26 weeks Primary evaluation period] and 13.5% Period 2 (0 
to 6 months of the extension study period). Haematocrit values seem to remain stable during long term 
(52 weeks) ravulizumab treatment. The applicant should provide final results of both studies as a 
Post-Authorisation Measure (PAM). 
With regard to the two populations included in pivotal clinical trials, that is, patients complement inhibitor 
naïve (n=246) and patients already on treatment with eculizumab (n=195), no major differences were 
observed in the safety profile of ravulizumab with data available so far. Overall incidence of AEs was 
comparable between studies. However, in study PNH-302, AEs related to study drug were more frequent 
in the ravulizumab arm than in the eculizumab arm (24.7% vs. 14.3%), mainly driven by the higher 
incidence of headache in patients treated with ravulizumab (12.4% vs. 4.1%). Nevertheless, the 
incidence was still lower than in the PNH-301 study (40.8% ravulizumab vs. 41.3% eculizumab). On the 
contrary, SAEs and AEs grade 3 were lower in patients treated with ravulizumab in study PNH-302. 
Regarding AESIs, in study PNH-302 the proportion was higher in the ravulizumab arm than in the 
eculizumab arm (10.3% vs. 5.1%), mainly due to infusion reactions (8.2% vs. 3.1%, respectively), 
although the incidence was comparable with that reported in the study PNH-301. Among the most 
commonly reported AEs, in the study PNH-302 the incidence of headache was higher in patients treated 
with ravulizumab than with eculizumab, but lower than in the PNH-301 study.  
Ravulizumab PK profile, allows a more comfortable posology for the patient. However, from a safety point 
of view, the longer half-life of ravulizumab could make difficult to manage toxicity in case it appears.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab appears similar to that of eculizumab in patients with PNH, both 
in patients complement inhibitor naïve and in patients already on treatment with eculizumab. The most 
commonly reported adverse events with ravulizumab were headache, upper respiratory tract infections 
and nasopharyngitis. Meningococcal infection is an important risk of ravulizumab related to its mode of 
action. In ravulizumab clinical trials, three cases of meningococcal infection were reported.

Safety data are limited. Final results of both studies will be submitted as a category 3 measure (see RMP) 
in the post authorisation phase to better characterize the safety profile of ravulizumab.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 01.01.2019.   
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that ravulizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ravulizumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ultomiris (ravulizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is a very rare and life threatening acquired haemolytic disorder. 
The hallmark of PNH disease activity is complement-mediated haemolysis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The only approved drug for PNH, eculizumab (Soliris), was approved in 2007 in the EU. Eculizumab is a 
selective, humanized mAb that specifically targets C5 of the terminal complement cascade, inhibiting its 
cleavage during complement activation into C5a and C5b.  
Ravulizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to complement component 5 (C5) 
and blocks its activation by complement pathway convertases. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two non-inferiority, Phase 3, Randomized, Multicentre, Open-Label, Active-Controlled studies of 
ravulizumab versus eculizumab were conducted in 2 distinct and complementary populations with PNH: a 
complement inhibitor naïve population of patients with active haemolysis to establish the efficacy 
response with ravulizumab (Study ALXN1210-PNH-301; N=246), and a population of patients on 
eculizumab therapy for at least the past 6 months with stable disease to assess maintenance of response 
with ravulizumab (Study ALXN1210-PNH-302; N=195). 
For Study ALXN1210 PNH 301, the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and LDH normalization 
allowed optimal characterization of the magnitude of effect in patients who were complement 
inhibitor-naïve and had active PNH disease. In contrast, for Study ALXN1210 PNH-302, the primary 
endpoint of change in LDH allowed optimal characterization of the maintenance of the high degree of 
disease control that patients had already achieved at baseline after a minimum of 6 months of eculizumab 
treatment. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both phase 3 studies ravulizumab achieved statistically significant non-inferiority compared to 
eculizumab, with lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) being greater than the pre-specified 
NIMs, reducing and maintaining control of haemolysis in patients with PNH.

Assessment report

73.6% of patients in the ravulizumab group and 66.1% in the eculizumab group avoided pRBC 
transfusion. The difference between the ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups in the percentage 
of patients who avoided transfusion was 6.8% (95% CI: -4.66%, 18.14%; NIM 20%). 
The adjusted prevalence of LDH-N (LDH levels ≤ 1 × ULN from Day 29 through Day 183) was 0.536 for the 
ravulizumab group and 0.494 for the eculizumab group. The adjusted odds ratio for the comparison of 
ravulizumab to eculizumab was 1.187 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.796, 1.769; NIM 0.39). Results 
from the primary analysis using the PP Set were consistent with those of the FAS, as were results from 
other sensitivity analyses  
Ravulizumab also achieved statistically significant non-inferiority compared to eculizumab on all 4 key 
secondary endpoints according to a pre-specified hierarchical testing order (1 Percentage change from 
baseline in LDH levels, 2 Change from baseline in QoL as assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale, 3 
Proportion of patients with BTH and 4 Proportion of patients with stabilized haemoglobin levels). 
• 
Study ALXN1210 PNH 302 (Phase 3): Eculizumab-Experienced Patients  
The LS estimate of the mean percent change in LDH showed a decrease of less than 1% ( 0.82% [SEM = 
3.033%]) for the ravulizumab group and an increase of greater than 8% (8.39% [SEM = 3.041%]) for the 
eculizumab group with a treatment difference (ravulizumab   eculizumab) of  9.21% (95% CI:  18.84%, 
0.42%; NIM 15%). 
Ravulizumab also achieved statistically significant non-inferiority compared to eculizumab on all 4 key 
secondary endpoints according to a pre-specified hierarchical testing order for non-inferiority (1 
Proportion of patients with BTH, 2 Change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the 
FACIT-Fatigue scale, 3 Proportion of patients with transfusion avoidance and 4 Proportion of patients with 
stabilized haemoglobin levels) 
The potential advantage of ravulizumab is the dosage and schedule of administration (q8w) in a chronic 
disease that could affect patients at different ages and conditions (old patients and young adults 
with/without other comorbidities).  
Comparison of efficacy results from the two Phase 3 studies shows that complement inhibitor-naïve and 
eculizumab-experienced patients with PNH both respond to ravulizumab treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Final results for Studies ALXN1210-PNH-301 and ALXN1210-PNH-302 will be submitted when available to 
confirm durability of response and safety profile. In order to avoid confusion due to potential change of 
treatment, a subset efficacy and safety analysis should be provided for patients from ALXN1210 arm.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of ravulizumab in the treatment of patients with PNH is based mainly on two phase 3 
clinical trials; one in complement inhibitor-naïve patients (Study PNH-301; n=246) and the other in 
patients who were clinically stable on eculizumab treatment (Study PNH-302; n=195). In total, 222 
patients were treated with ravulizumab in these phase 3 clinical trials and this population is considered 
the main safety database.  
Patients were treated with either ravulizumab or eculizumab for 26 weeks, with a median of infusions 
received of 4 (range: 1; 4) in the ravulizumab group and 15 (range: 1; 15) in the eculizumab group.

The overall incidence of AEs was 87.8% in the pooled ravulizumab group vs. 87.2% in the pooled 
eculizumab group. The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 10%) were headache (32% pooled ravulizumab 
vs. 26.0% pooled eculizumab), nasopharyngitis (14.4% vs. 17.4%) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(14.0% vs. 7.8%).  
Grade 3 AEs were reported in 12.6% of patients treated with ravulizumab and 15.1% of patients treated 
with eculizumab. There were 7 (3.2%) patients in the ravulizumab group and 2 (0.9%) patients in the 
eculizumab group that reported AEs of grade 4. The majority of events were related to haematology 
values altered and were considered by the investigator not related or unlikely related to study drug.  
SAEs were reported in 6.8% of patients in the pooled ravulizumab group vs. 7.8% in the pooled 
eculizumab group (5 [2.3%] vs. 2 [0.9%], considered related to study drug, respectively). Overall, the 
most frequent SAEs, reported in at least 2 patients, were pyrexia (1 [0.5%] pooled ravulizumab and 5 
[2.3%] eculizumab) and haemolysis (2 [0.9%] in the eculizumab group).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) with ravulizumab include: infections (meningococcal 
infections, Aspergillus infections, sepsis and other serious infections), infusion reactions, serious 
cutaneous adverse reactions, cardiac disorders and angioedema. The incidence of AESIs in the 
ravulizumab group was 12.2% vs. 8.2% in the eculizumab group. 
Three events of meningococcal infection were reported in studies PNH-201 (2 events) and PNH-103 (1 
event) among patients treated with ravulizumab. This is a well-known safety risk with Soliris due to the 
mechanism of action of these monoclonal antibodies and is manged with risk minimisation measures (see 
RMP). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
One of the main limitations is the absence of comparative long-term safety data, especially in the setting 
of a chronic indication. Patients were treated with either ravulizumab or eculizumab for 26 weeks, with a 
median of only 4 ravulizumab infusions received. 
Only 26 patients (11.7%) were older than 65 years among patients treated with ravulizumab in pivotal 
clinical trials. Thus, data on the use of ravulizumab in elderly patients are considered limited, especially in 
patients ≥ 75 years. 
Further safety data will be obtained from the final Clinical Study Report for Studies ALXN1210-PNH-301 
and ALXN1210-PNH-302 a registry study.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In both phase 3 studies ravulizumab achieved statistically significant non-inferiority compared to 
eculizumab, with lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) being greater than the pre-specified 
NIMs, reducing and maintaining control of haemolysis in patients with PNH. The evidence of 
non-inferiority was considered statistically convincing and there is good concordance among efficacy 
endpoints. Considering those results and non-inferiority design, and the indication being in line with 
eculizumab, ravulizumab offers an option to patients with a very rare disease with the added potential 
advantage of a more convenient treatment schedule as per the q8w dose.  
From a safety point of view, while no major differences have been observed in the safety profile of 
ravulizumab compared to eculizumab, data are still rather limited, thus, additional data in the long term 
will be obtained from post authorisation studies to better characterize the safety profile of ravulizumab. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Non-inferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab has been demonstrated in phase 3 trials for naïve and 
eculizumab-pretreated patients, in a consistent manner across subgroups studied. The safety profile is in 
line with the already known for eculizumab. The efficacy outweighs the risks associated with the 
treatment which can be managed with risk minimisation measures (see SmPC, Annex II and RMP). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk of Ultomiris in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH):         
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/220699/2019  
Page 124/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 
months  
is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Ultomiris is similar to Soliris within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 
141/2000 the following derogation laid down in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation applies: 
- 
the holder of the marketing authorisation for Soliris has given his consent to the applicant. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Ultomiris is favourable in the following indication: 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH):         
- 
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity  
in patients who hare clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the 
past 6  months. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Based on the data provided as part of this application, 
teriparatide treatment does not seem to increase the risk of 
osteosarcoma, and no difference in the incidence rate of 
osteosarcoma was observed between the study cohorts. 
The risk of osteosarcoma will continue to be closely 
monitored.  
The benefit-risk balance of Forsteo, remains positive.

GHDW (VERO): a 24-month, randomized, double-blind, 
and PL 
comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1,360 
postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 
subjects were randomised to Forsteo and 680 subjects 
were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At 
baseline, the women had a mean age of 72.1 years and a 
median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of 
patients had received previous bisphosphonate therapy and 
18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 
1,013 (74.5%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up. 
The mean (median) cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 
474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) 
mg in the risedronate arm. The mean (median) vitamin D 
intake for the teriparatide arm was 1433 IU/day (1400 
IU/day) and for the risedronate arm was 1191 IU/day (900 
IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and follow-up 
spine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures 
was 28/516 (5.4%) in Forsteo- and 64/533 (12.0%) in 
risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 
(0.29-0.68), P<0.0001. The cumulative incidence of pooled 
clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures) was 4.8% in Forsteo and 9.8% in risedronate-
treated patients, hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), 
P=0.0009.

anaphylactic reaction with teriparatide revealed 13 cases in 
which a causal association could not be excluded (including 
1 fatality). 
Overall, the causal association demonstrated in these cases 
support the recommendation to update section 4.8 of the 
SmPC and section 4 of the Package Leaflet. Based on the 
guidance on the estimation of frequency of adverse 
reactions from spontaneous reporting in the European 
Commission’s SmPC Guideline the calculated frequency of 
anaphylaxis is “rare”. This calculation has been verified and 
is considered acceptable. Furthermore, it is agreed that the 
addition of this adverse events to the RMP at present is not 
warranted. Having considered all the data presented, 
anaphylaxis in association with teriparatide is at present 
not considered to have an impact on the benefit-risk 
balance of Forsteo or any implications for public health. The 
addition of the event anaphylaxis to the RMP as a safety 
Page 7/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concern would not change the ongoing active surveillance 
on anaphylaxis. The proposed product information changes 
along with active surveillance are considered adequate risk 
minimisation for teriparatide and the adverse event of 
anaphylaxis.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

(Study B3D-EW-GHCA) and on 214 patients on systemic 
glucocorticoid therapy (Study B3D-US-GHBZ)  provided by 
the MAH showed that further bone mineral density gain is 
achieved when continuing treatment with FORSTEO from 
18 to 24 months. 
Based on safety data from these trials and from post-
marketing experience, it is not expected that 6 additional 
months of treatment would significantly change the safety 
profile of the product. Therefore, the benefit/risk balance of 
FORSTEO is considered favourable up to 24 months of 
treatment.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Forsteo was adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit risk 
profile of Forsteo continues to be favourable. Nevertheless, 
the CHMP requested an additional five-year renewal due to 
the limited use in two recently approved extensions of 
indications: osteoporosis in men at increased risk of 
fracture and treatment of osteoporosis associated with 
sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture.  The CHMP concluded

cases, 39 cases reported concurrent disease states 
associated with increased ALP levels and in 38 cases 
concomitant medication has been reported that may be 
associated with hepatotoxicity.  Many cases did not contain 
sufficient information to assess for confounding factors.  
The ALP value was provided in 117 cases.  The majority of 
cases had no elevation or mild elevation of ALP.  ALP was 
considered to be moderately to severely increase in 14 
cases.  Of these 14 cases, 5 patients recovered after 
stopping teriparatide and 3 patients recovered or were 
recovering while continuing teriparatide therapy.  Thus, 
section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to include "Alkaline 
phosphatase increase".  In line with the draft revision of 
the SPC guideline (December 2007) in case of an 
unexpected adverse reaction detected from spontaneous 
reporting, each adequately designed study where this 
reaction could have been detected should be reviewed to 
choose a frequency category.  Thus, based on the

period from 27 May 2005 to 26 May 2006, a total of 64 
cases of oedema have been reported from the post 
marketing surveillance. Reports related to oedema were 
commonly reported with a reporting rate of 0.02% (64/303 
000). Furthermore, a positive rechallenge has been 
reported in 4 cases. The majority of cases of oedema 
associated with Forsteo were "peripheral oedema". 
Although there were cases which were not indicative of a 
causal relationship, the CHMP concluded that overall the 
cases of oedema suggested a causal role of Forsteo. 
Thus, section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to include the 
rare adverse reaction "oedema (mainly peripheral)".

include a statement on reduction in non-vertebral 
fractures in women. Furthermore, the therapeutic 
indications have been extended to include the 
treatment of osteoporosis in men. Section 5.1 of the 
SPC has been updated to include information on non-
vertebral fractures and osteoporosis in men. Section 
1 "What Forsteo is and what it is used for" of the PL 
has been updated accordingly. 
The Annexes were updated in line with the 
EMEA/QRD template version 7.2, including the 
addition of the two new EU Member States (Bulgaria 
and Romania) in the list of local representative in the 
PL. Finally, the contact details of the local 
representatives in Estonia, Slovakia and Spain were 
updated and some pictures in the user manual of the

2nd PSUR for Forsteo, covering the period from 27 
November 2003 to 26 May 2004 the MAH has proposed to 
update section 4.8 of the SPC with adverse events based 
on post-marketing spontaneous reports of hypercalcemia 
greater than 2.76 mmol/l (11mg/dl), hypercalcemia greater 
than 3.25 mmol/l (13mg/dl) and possible allergic events 
soon after injection (acute dyspnoea, oro/facial oedema, 
generalized urticaria, chest pain). 
As requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the 
2nd PSUR for Forsteo, the MAH has also proposed to 
update section 4.9 of the SPC with information on overdose 
based on post-marketing spontaneous reports.

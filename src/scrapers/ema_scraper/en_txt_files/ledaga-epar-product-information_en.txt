CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ledaga is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
(MF-type CTCL) in adult patients (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Ledaga should be initiated by an appropriately experienced physician. 
Posology 
A thin film of Ledaga should be applied once daily to affected areas of the skin. 
Treatment with Ledaga should be stopped for any grade of skin ulceration or blistering, or moderately 
severe or severe dermatitis (e.g., marked skin redness with oedema). Upon improvement, treatment 
with Ledaga can be restarted at a reduced frequency of once every 3 days. If reintroduction of 
treatment is tolerated for at least 1 week, the frequency of application can be increased to every other 
day for at least 1 week and then to once-daily application if tolerated. 
Elderly 
The dosing recommendation for elderly patients (  65 years old) is the same as for younger adult 
patients (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Ledaga in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available.

Method of administration 
Ledaga is for topical application to the skin. 
The following instructions should be followed by patients or caregivers when applying Ledaga: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients must wash hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling or 
applying Ledaga. Patients should apply Ledaga to affected areas of the skin. In case of Ledaga 
exposure to non-affected areas of the skin, patients should wash the exposed area with soap and 
water.  
Caregivers must wear disposable nitrile gloves when applying Ledaga to patients. Caregivers 
should remove gloves carefully (turning them inside out during the removal to avoid contact 
with Ledaga) and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after removal of gloves. If there 
is accidental skin exposure to Ledaga, caregivers must immediately wash exposed areas 
thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. Remove and wash contaminated 
clothing. 
The opening of the tube is covered with a foil safety seal. The cap should be used to puncture 
the seal. The tube should not be used and the pharmacist should be contacted if the seal is 
missing, punctured, or lifted. 
Ledaga should be applied immediately or within 30 minutes after removal from the refrigerator. 
The tube should be returned to the refrigerator immediately after each use. With clean hands, 
the tube should be placed back into the original box and the box should be placed in the 
supplied transparent, sealable, plastic bag for storage in the refrigerator. 
Ledaga should be applied to completely dry skin at least 4 hours before or 30 minutes after 
showering or washing. The patient should allow treated areas to dry for 5 to 10 minutes after 
application before covering with clothing. Occlusive (air- or water-tight) dressings should not 
be used on areas of the skin where Ledaga was applied.  
Emollients (moisturisers) or other topical products may be applied to the treated areas 2 hours 
before or 2 hours after application of Ledaga. 
Fire, flame, and smoking must be avoided until Ledaga has dried. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to chlormethine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Mucosal or eye exposure  
Contact with mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Exposure of mucous 
membranes such as the oral mucosa or nasal mucosa causes pain, redness, and ulceration, and these 
may be severe. Exposure of the eyes to chlormethine causes pain, burns, inflammation, photophobia, 
and blurred vision. Blindness and severe irreversible anterior eye injury may occur. 
Patients should be advised that if any mucous membrane exposure occurs: 
• 
• 
irrigation should be performed immediately for at least 15 minutes with copious amounts of 
water (or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or a balanced salt ophthalmic 
irrigating solution may be used if there is eye exposure), and 
medical care should be obtained immediately (including ophthalmological consultation if there 
is eye exposure). 
Local skin reactions 
Patients should be assessed during treatment for skin reactions such as dermatitis (e.g., redness, 
swelling, inflammation), pruritus, blisters, ulceration, and skin infections. The face, genitalia, anus, and 
intertriginous skin are at increased risk of skin reactions to topical chlormethine. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For dose modification information in case of skin reactions, see section 4.2. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including isolated cases of anaphylaxis, have been reported in the literature 
after the use of topical formulations of chlormethine (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Skin cancer 
Skin-directed therapies for MF-type CTCL have been associated with secondary skin cancers, 
although the specific contribution of chlormethine has not been established. Patients should be 
monitored for development of skin cancers during and after discontinuation of treatment with 
chlormethine. 
Secondary exposure to Ledaga 
Direct skin contact with Ledaga should be avoided in individuals other than the patient. Risks of 
secondary exposure may include skin reactions, mucosal injury, and skin cancers. Recommended 
application instructions should be followed to prevent secondary exposure (see section 4.2). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains propylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene.  
Propylene glycol may cause skin irritation. 
Butylhydroxytoluene may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes 
and mucous membranes. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Ledaga is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of chlormethine in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity after systemic administration (see section 5.3). 
Ledaga is not recommended during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether chlormethine is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded due to the potential for topical or systemic exposure of 
the breast-feeding child to chlormethine through contact with the mother’s skin. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Ledaga therapy, 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the breast-
feeding mother.

Fertility 
In animals, adverse effects of chlormethine on male fertility after systemic administration have been 
documented (see section 5.3). The relevance to humans receiving topical chlormethine is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ledaga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In a randomised-controlled trial (n=128 exposed to Ledaga for a median duration of 52 weeks), the 
most frequent adverse reactions to Ledaga were skin related: dermatitis (54.7%; e.g., skin irritation, 
erythema, rash, urticaria, skin-burning sensation, pain of the skin), pruritus (20.3%), skin infections 
(11.7%), skin ulceration and blistering (6.3%), and skin hyperpigmentation (5.5%). Cutaneous 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 2.3% of the treated patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported with Ledaga in an active-controlled trial in patients with MF-type CTCL 
are shown below. Frequencies were defined using the following convention: very common ( 1/10); 
common ( 1/100 to  1/10); uncommon ( 1/1,000 to  1/100); rare ( 1/10,000 to  1/1,000); very 
rare ( 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Elderly population 
In the controlled clinical trial, 31% (79/255) of the study population were aged 65 years or older. The 
safety profile observed in elderly patients was consistent with that in the overall patient population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose after cutaneous use of Ledaga were reported during the clinical development 
programme or post-marketing period. Management of overdose should consist of washing the exposed 
area with water.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, nitrogen mustard analogues, ATC code: L01AA05. 
Mechanism of action 
Chlormethine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Ledaga were assessed in a randomised, multicentre, observer-blinded, 
active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial (Study 201) of 260 adult patients with Stage IA (141), 
IB (115), and IIA (4) MF-type CTCL who had received at least one prior skin-directed therapy. 
Qualifying prior therapies included topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, topical bexarotene, and 
topical nitrogen mustard. Patients were not required to be refractory to or intolerant of prior therapies. 
Patients were stratified based on stage (IA vs IB and IIA) and then randomised to receive either 
Ledaga (equivalent to 0.02% chlormethine HCl) or the comparator (a petroleum-based 0.02% 
chlormethine HCl ointment). 
Study medicinal product was to be applied topically once daily for 12 months. Dosing could be 
suspended or continued at reduced frequency in the case of skin reactions. The median daily usage of 
Ledaga was 1.8 g. The maximum individual daily usage in the trial was 10.5 g of gel (i.e., 2.1 mg of 
chlormethine HCl). 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 201 was the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity 
(CAILS) response rate. Assessment was undertaken by a blinded observer. A response was defined as 
an at least 50% improvement in the baseline CAILS score, confirmed at a subsequent visit at least 
4 weeks later. A complete response was defined as a confirmed CAILS score of 0. A partial response 
was defined as an at least 50% reduction in the baseline CAILS score. Non-inferiority was considered 
to have been demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval around the ratio of 
response rates (Ledaga/comparator) was greater than or equal to 0.75. The CAILS score was adjusted 
by removal of the pigmentation score and simplification of the plaque elevation scale. 
As the main secondary endpoint, patients were also evaluated using the Severity Weighted Assessment 
Tool (SWAT), which was based on an assessment of all lesions. The response criteria were the same 
as for CAILS. 
Efficacy was evaluated in the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population, which included all 185 patients 
who were treated for at least 6 months with no major protocol deviations [Table 1], and in the Intent-
To-Treat (ITT) population, which included all 260 randomised patients.

CAILS = Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity; CI = confidence interval; CR = Complete Response; PR = Partial 
Response; SWAT = Severity Weighted Assessment Tool. 
The ratio of response and the 95% confidence interval in the ITT population were 1.226 (0.974–1.552) 
for CAILS and 1.017 (0.783–1.321) for SWAT and therefore consistent with those in the EE 
population for both the overall CAILS and SWAT responses. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reductions in mean CAILS scores were observed as early as at 4 weeks, with further reductions 
observed with continuing therapy. 
In the EE population, the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed response by CAILS was 
similar between disease stages IA (79.6 %) and IB–IIA (73.2%). 
Results in other secondary endpoints (response in percentage of body surface area affected, time to 
first confirmed CAILS response, duration of first confirmed CAILS response and time to disease 
progression) were consistent with those for CAILS and SWAT. 
A small number of subjects (6.3%, 8/128) treated with Ledaga utilised topical corticosteroids. Thus, 
the safety of the concomitant use of Ledaga with topical corticosteroids has not yet been established.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ledaga in all subsets of the paediatric population in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Patients who received Ledaga in Study 201 had no measurable concentrations of chlormethine in 
blood collected 1, 3 and 6 hours post-application on Day 1, and at the first month visit.  
Similarly, patients who received chlormethine gel 0.04% in a follow-up study (Study 202) had no 
measurable concentrations of chlormethine or its degradation product (half-mustard) in blood collected 
1 hour post-application on Day 1 or after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Chlormethine was shown to be genotoxic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells. Chlormethine was 
carcinogenic in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies after subcutaneous and intravenous 
administration. 
Dermal application of chlormethine to mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg for up to 33 weeks resulted in skin 
tumours (squamous cell carcinomas and skin papilloma). There were no reports of systemic tumours 
after topical administration of chlormethine. 
Intravenously administered chlormethine impaired male fertility in rats at a dose of  0.25 mg/kg once 
every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. No dedicated animal studies on the effects of chlormethine on female 
fertility have been reported in the literature. 
Chlormethine caused foetal malformations in mice and rats when given as single injections of 1–
2.5 mg/kg. Other findings in animals included embryo-lethality and growth retardation when 
administered as a single injection.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ledaga is and what it is used for 
Ledaga contains the active substance chlormethine. This is an anti-cancer medicine used on the skin to 
treat mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). 
MF-type CTCL is a condition in which certain cells of the body’s immune system called  
T-lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin. Chlormethine is a type of anti-cancer medicine 
called an ‘alkylating agent’. It attaches to the DNA of dividing cells, like cancer cells, which stops 
them from multiplying and growing. 
Ledaga is for use in adults only. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ledaga 
Do not use Ledaga 
- 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to chlormethine or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Ledaga. 
- 
- 
- 
Contact with your eyes must be avoided. Do not apply the medicine near the eyes, to the inside 
of the nostrils, the inside of the ear or on the lips. 
If Ledaga gets in your eyes, it can cause pain, burning, swelling, redness, sensitivity to light, and 
blurred vision. It may also cause blindness and severe permanent injury to your eyes. If Ledaga 
gets in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, 
a solution known as “0.9% sodium chloride solution” or an eye-wash solution, and seek medical 
assistance (including an eye doctor) as soon as possible. 
If this medicine gets in your mouth or nose, it can cause pain, redness, and ulcers that may be 
severe. Rinse the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, 
and seek medical assistance as soon as possible.

This medicine can cause skin reactions, such as inflammation of your skin (redness and 
swelling), itching, blisters, ulcers and skin infections (see section 4). The risk for inflammation 
of the skin is increased if you apply Ledaga to your face, genital area, anus or skin folds. 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to chlormethine. Contact your doctor 
or seek immediate medical attention if you experience allergic reactions to Ledaga (see 
section 4). 
Skin cancers (abnormal growth of the cells in the skin) have been reported after application of 
chlormethine to the skin, although it is not known whether chlormethine causes this. Your 
doctor will check your skin for skin cancers during and after your treatment with Ledaga. Tell 
your doctor if you get any new damaged areas or ulcers on your skin. 
Direct skin contact with Ledaga should be avoided in individuals other than the patient, such as 
caregivers. Risks of direct skin contact include inflammation of the skin (dermatitis), injury to 
their eyes, mouth, or nose, and skin cancers. Caregivers who accidentally come into contact 
with Ledaga must wash the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes. Remove and wash 
any contaminated clothing. Get medical help right away if Ledaga gets into your eyes, mouth, or 
nose. 
Children and adolescents

effectiveness have not been established for this age group. 
Other medicines and Ledaga 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
There is limited experience of chlormethine in pregnant women. Therefore, the use of this medicine is 
not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age not using contraception. 
It is not known whether Ledaga passes into breast milk, and there may be a risk that the breast-feeding 
baby is exposed to Ledaga via contact with the mother’s skin. Therefore, it is not recommended to 
breast-feed while taking this medicine.You should talk to your doctor before breast-feeding to 
determine whether or not it is best to breast-feed or to use Ledaga. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Ledaga contains propylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene 
Propylene glycol may cause skin irritation. Butylhydroxytoluene may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatits), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes.

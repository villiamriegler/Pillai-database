2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody acting as immune checkpoint 
inhibitor  through  the  block  of  the  interaction  between  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  its 
ligands PD-L1 and PDL2. As a consequence, the functional activity of the target lymphocytes is enhanced to 
facilitate immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. 
Lung  cancer  has  been  among  the  most  common  cancers  in  the  world  for  several  decades.  The  2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung 
cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except 
non-melanoma  skin  cancers)  and  19.4%  of  all  cancer  deaths  (except  non-melanoma  skin  cancers). 
Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 6/83 
 
 
 
and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the 
United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al, 2013).  
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and NSCLC. Approximately 85% 
of  all  lung  cancers  are  NSCLC,  which  is  frequently  further  subdivided  into  non-squamous  carcinoma 
(including  adenocarcinoma,  large-cell  carcinoma,  and  other  cell  types)  and  squamous  cell  (epidermoid) 
carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th 
Edition. 2011). Recently, histology has emerged as a predictive factor for pemetrexed efficacy (Scagliotti G. 
et al 2011) and a determinant of toxicity with bevacizumab for patients with advanced NSCLC (Johnson DH. 
et al, 2004). 
For the majority of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage with an overall poor prognosis. The 
overall survival (OS) for metastatic NSCLC is dismal with 5-year survival of <5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016). 
In addition, over the past decade molecular subsets based on the presence of driver mutations have been 
identified.  In  particular,  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  mutations  and  anaplastic  lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements were the first molecular alterations shown to confer sensitivity to specific 
targeted therapies. 
According to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for metastatic NSCLC (Novello S. et al, 2016), in the 
absence of driver mutations first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (four with a maximum of six 
cycles) is recommended in patients with good performance status, based on the observed prolonged survival 
and improved quality of life (QoL). A comparable efficacy has been observed with several regimens including 
cisplatin and carboplatin combinations with gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel (Schiller JH. et al, 2002). 
The addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based backbone regimen improved OS in non-squamous NSCLC 
patients  with  ECOG  PS  0-1  (Sandler  A.  et  al,  2006).  Therefore,  the  combination  of  bevacizumab  and 
platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered in eligible non-squamous NSCLC.  
In case of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
rearrangements, approved target therapy agents are available. 
The efficacy of maintenance treatment, either as maintained use of an agent included in first-line treatment 
(“continuation  maintenance”)  or  as  introduction  of  a  new  agent  after  4  cycles  of  platinum-based 
chemotherapy (“switch maintenance”) has been investigated in various trials. Improvement in efficacy has 
been  reported  with  pemetrexed  (both  continuation  and  switch  maintenance,  only  in  non-squamous 
histology) and erlotinib (switch maintenance in patients with stable disease after first-line chemotherapy). 
The prognosis for patients who failed first line therapies is dismal. A poor response rate was reported from 
single agent docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib (4.0% - 17.9%), with the median progression free survival 
(PFS)  of  1.5  to  4.2  months  and  the  overall  survival  (OS)  ranging  from  5.4  to 14.8  months.  A  small but 
statistically  significant  improvement  over  docetaxel  single  agent  was  registered  with  the  addition  of 
ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically binding VEGF Receptor 2, that has been recently approved 
in combination with docetaxel as a second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients. The combination of 
docetaxel plus ramucirumab showed a small but statistically significant improvement in terms of PFS (HR 
0.76, median PFS 4.5 vs. 3.0 months) and OS (HR 0.86, median OS 10.5 vs. 9.1 months).  
Nintedanib,  a  multi  kinase  inhibitor,  in  combination  with  docetaxel  has  been  also  approved  for  the 
second-line treatment of NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma, based on the demonstration of a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS and OS compared to docetaxel single agent (PFS: HR 0.84, median PFS 4.2 
vs.  2.8  months  in  the  follow-up  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  OS:  HR  0.83,  median  12.6  vs.  10.3 
months). 
Nivolumab, a different antibody directed against PD-1, is approved for the treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic squamous and non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 7/83 
 
Additional therapeutic options able to prolong survival and to improve quality of life are still needed for the 
treatment of advanced NSCLC.  
In  the  European  Union  (EU)  Keytruda  received  a  marketing  authorisation  (MA)  on  17  July  2015  as 
monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  (unresectable  or  metastatic)  melanoma  in  adults,  and  was 
approved on 29 July 2016 for the treatment of previously treated PD-L1 positive NSCLC patients.  
The current application is a type II variation to extend the indication for the treatment of advanced PD-L1 
positive  Non-Small  Cell  Lung  Carcinoma  (NSCLC)  also  including  patients  previously  untreated,  based  on 
results from the study KEYNOTE-024 “A Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial of Pembrolizumab versus 
(vs.)  Platinum  based  Chemotherapy  in  First-Line  (1L)  Subjects  with  Programmed  Cell  Death  1  Ligand  1 
(PD-L1) Strong Metastatic NSCLC”.  
The MAH applied for the following change of indication:  
“KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma 
(NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy 
regimen.  Patients  with  EGFR  or  ALK  positive  tumour  mutations  should  also  have  received  prior 
therapy approved therapy for these mutations prior to before receiving KEYTRUDA.” 
Based on the CHMP request to restrict the pembrolizumab indication in the treatment of first-line NSCLC to 
PD-L1 strong tumour (TPS≥50%), the MAH proposed to update the wording of the indication as follows: 
“KEYTRUDA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1with a ≥50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with 
no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations. 
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults 
whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy 
regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received approved targeted 
therapy for these mutations prior to before receiving KEYTRUDA.” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the 
environment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
KEYNOTE-024 is the first study providing a substantial amount of pharmacokinetic data on the 200 mg Q3W 
fixed dose regimen in NSCLC patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in target populations 
Pre-dose (trough) samples were taken from 150 patients at cycle 1, 2, 4, 8 and every 8 cycles thereafter,  
plus  at  1,  3  and  6  months  after  last  dose  of  pembrolizumab  (at  the  same  time  as  blood  collection  for 
anti-pembrolizumab antibodies). Post-dose samples were taken at cycle 1: within 30 minutes after end of 
infusion,  and  one  sample  between  72  and  168  hr  post-infusion.  Summary  statistics  of  the  observed 
pembrolizumab trough (pre-dose) and post-dose concentrations in NSCLC subjects from P024 are presented 
in the table below:

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction 
with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been 
shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, 
including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-L2,  which  are 
expressed  in  antigen  presenting  cells  and  may  be  expressed  by  tumours  or  other  cells  in  the  tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
An Immunogenicity  Analysis  has been performed to evaluate immunogenicity status of subjects with 
Melanoma (P001, P002, P006), NSCLC (P001, P010, P024) and HNSCC (P012, P055). 
In the immunogenicity assessment, 2873 subjects were included (1535 Melanoma subjects, 1237 NSCLC 
subjects and 101 HNSCC subjects). The overall immunogenicity incidence was defined as the proportion of 
treatment  emergent  positive  subjects  to  the  total  number  of  evaluable  subjects  (treatment  emergent 
positive, non-treatment emergent positive and negative immunogenicity status). 
The  samples  were  assayed 
for  anti-pembrolizumab  antibodies  presence,  using  a  validated 
electrochemiluminescense (ECL) immunoassay. During the course of the study, measurement of the ADA 
samples was transferred from Intertek to another Vendor (PPD). 
As part of the assay transfer, the ADA screening assay was further optimized to increase the DTL. Part of the 
samples  was  analysed  at  Intertek,  and  part  of  the  samples  was  analysed  at  PPD.  All  the  samples  were 
analysed using the same type of assay. For the evaluation of each individual ADA sample, the DTL of the 
corresponding assay has been used. The DTL for the ADA assay executed at Intertek is 25 μg/mL, the DTL 
for the ADA screening assay executed at PPD is 124 μg/mL. 
In the current database, 12824 samples from 3182 subjects were available. All samples were tested in the 
ADA screening assay, 7932 samples were tested at Intertek (P001, P002, P006, P010 and P012), and 5053 
samples were tested at PPD (P001, P006, P010, P012, P024 and P055), including 161 samples reanalysed at

PPD  because  of  non-reportable or  missing  results  from  Intertek.  From  one  sample  the  quantity  was  not 
sufficient (QNS), and eight samples were non-reportable (NRR). In total, 12815 samples had reportable 
results from the screening assay. 
A summary of subject immunogenicity results is reported in the table below. 
Table 2: Summary of subject immunogenicity results (pooled analysis of P001, P002, P006, P010, P012, 
P024 and P055) 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Pharmacokinetics of Pembrolizumab in First-line NSCLC on Protocol 024 
The definitive population PK model was developed by a pooled analysis of concentration data from P001 (all 
data related to doses of 1 mg/kg and higher), P002 and P006. Based on this population PK analysis, the 
pembrolizumab PK profile is typical for a therapeutic mAb, with a low systemic clearance (0.2 L/day) and a 
low volume of distribution (7 L) at steady state, that is predicted to be achieved after approximately 19 
weeks (for the dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W). Elimination half-life (t1/2) is 25 days. For this updated 
population PK evaluation, the data from studies P010 and P024 were added to the initial dataset and the 
parameters from the existing population PK model were re-estimated to obtain posthoc parameters for all 
the individuals included in this pooled dataset.  
The final analysis data set comprised 16800 pembrolizumab concentrations from 2993 subjects. The number 
of subjects and PK observations by dose in the pooled analysis datasets are provided in the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 11/83 
 
 
Table 3: Numbers of subjects and observations by dose and dosing regimen in the pooled analysis dataset 
(P001, P002, P006, P010, P024) 
Pembrolizumab  serum  concentrations  determined  to  be  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (BLQ)  were 
excluded  from  the  analysis  and  effects  of  outliers  (defined  as  data  with  |CWRES|>6  or  |IWRES|>6)  on 
parameter estimates and uncertainty were assessed re-running the final model after reintroduction of the 
outlying data. 
The  definitive  popPK  model  for  pembrolizumab  had  a  two-compartment  model  structure  with  a  linear 
clearance from the central compartment, parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), inter-compartmental 
clearance  (Q),  central  compartment  volume  of  distribution  (Vc),  and  peripheral  compartment  volume  of 
distribution  (Vp).  All  PK  parameters  were  allometrically  scaled  based  on  body  weight  with  separate 
exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters. 
In addition to body weight, the existing popPK model contained several more covariate relationships, which 
were established through a stepwise covariate search.  
For continuous covariates was used the generic form similar to the relationships for body weight. Following 
are reported the distributive statistics of continuous covariates included in the dataset. 
Table 4: Summary of continuous covariate included in the analysis dataset 
Descriptive statistics of categorical covariates in the analysis dataset are reported below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 12/83 
 
 
 
Table 5: Summary of categorical covariates included in the analysis dataset 
The first-line NSCLC population from Protocol 024 was generally similar to the melanoma and second-line 
NSCLC population in terms of continuous and categorical covariate distributions. Average body weight was 
somewhat lower in first-line NSCLC patients, and baseline ALP was somewhat higher, proportion of patients 
with ECOG=1 was larger. 
No  formal  covariate  evaluation  was  planned,  previously  established  covariate  relationships  were 
re-estimated (see table below). 
Table 6: Covariates included in definitive pop PK model 
The  stepwise  covariate  analysis  identified  a  statistically  significant  effect  of  the  line  of  NSCLC  therapy 
covariate on both CL and Vc. As the estimates of the effects for first-line NSCLC and second-line NSCLC 
relative to melanoma were similar, this covariate has been converted into an indication indicator (NSCLC 
versus melanoma). Since for both CL and Vc, the pooling of the two NSCLC subgroups did result in a minor 
(non-significant at P<0.001) change in OFV, the model was subsequently simplified to have cancer type as 
a covariate on CL and Vc. Goodness of fit plots of the final model are reported below.

The small underprediction observed, especially at later time points, is similar to that observed in previous 
population  PK  analyses.  The  MAH  performed  a  dedicated  evaluation  to  assess  potential  origins  of  this 
apparent bias in the model predictions. The results of this evaluation indicated that the apparent on-study 
increases  in  concentration  at  time  points  long  after  treatment  initiation  are  mostly  attributable  to 
informative  censoring  patterns  in  the  data.  After  accounting  for  the  association  between  clearance  and 
dropout, the adjusted visual predictive checks adequately reflected the available data. 
The  Visual  Predictive  Check  (VPC)  for  peak  sample  concentrations  of  the  200mg  Q3W  dosing  group  is 
reported below. 
Figure 4: Visual predictive check for 200 mg Q3W dosing group peak concentrations for P024 
Given the limited peak concentrations and time points collected in 200mg Q3W comparing to other dosing 
groups, VPC shows that the peak concentrations of the 200mg Q3W are less well described by the model. 
The existing population PK model, developed on data obtained with weight-based dose regimens, provided 
predictions  of  the  concentration  observations  with  this  fixed  dose  regimen,  indicating  that  the  PK  of 
pembrolizumab are consistent across fixed and weight-based dose regimens.

Figure 6: pembrolizumab exposure across indications at clinically tested dose regimens 
The exposure data for 200 mg Q3W from KEYNOTE-024 lie between the exposures from the cumulative 
clinical experience at 2 and 10 mg/kg and is similar to exposures from historical 2 mg/kg dose data.  
With  the  expanded  dataset,  the  additional  effect  of  cancer  type  on  central  volume  of  distribution  was 
identified, which was not present in the definitive population PK model as established for pembrolizumab. As 
the effect size was small, this covariate effect has been judged clinically unimportant by the MAH. 
The predicted median concentration-time profiles over the initial 24 weeks of pembrolizumab for the four 
dosing regimens evaluated across pembrolizumab program are presented in the figure below. The 200 mg 
Q3W regimen exhibits a very similar accumulation pattern as seen with 2 mg/kg Q3W. There is only limited 
overlap in individual exposures between 200 mg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W, which can be expected 
with the large difference between these two doses.

Exposure-response analysis for efficacy 
The MAH performed an ER analysis in order to assess the relationship between exposure to pembrolizumab 
in serum (i.e. AUC over 6 weeks at steady state; AUCss-6weeks) and the anti-tumor response measured as 
the sum of the longest dimension (SLD) of the tumour lesions in first-line NSCLC (including subjects treated 
in  adjuvant  and  neo-adjuvant  settings).    A  flat  concentration-efficacy  relationship  was  demonstrated  for 
NSCLC  with  the  Modelling  &  Simulation  Report  “Model-based  analysis  of  the  relationship  between 
pembrolizumab exposure and efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in PN001 and 
PN010”. As results of covariate research it was found that that PD-L1 expression status was significantly 
associated  with  the  estimated  rate  of  tumour  size  decline;  subject  age  and  EGFR  mutation  status  were 
predictive of higher rates of tumour growth.  
In support of this submission, an exploratory analysis of tumour size change was conducted with all available 
data in treatment-naïve subjects with NSCLC to verify whether new data from subjects receiving the 200 mg 
fixed dose alters prior exposure-response assessments from the body weight-based dosing.  
All data preparation and presentation was performed using SAS Version 9 and R version 3.0.1 (R-project, 
www.r-project.org) were used for post-processing. 
The dataset consist of patients receiving MK-347 as first line therapy for NSCLC, a subset of patients from 
P001,  P010  and  from  P024.  A  total  of  278  patients  were  allocated  to  receive  MK-3475  as  
1L/adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy for NSCLC. Of these patients, 263 were treated with MK-3475 and 247 
had both a baseline tumour measurement and available PK data. The table below reports the number of 
patients with available PK data: 
Table 10: Number of patients in tumour size modelling (FAS) dataset with available PK data, categorised by 
treatment (dose + schedule) and cohort (protocol 1 N=85/ Protocol 10 N=13/ Protocol 24 N=149) 
The total of 1122 SLD observations were taken from the 247 patients with at least one observable baseline 
measurement and available PK data. Of these 247 patients, 131 had a tumour size measurement within the 
26-30 week (28 +/- 2 week) window. Of these 131 subjects, 102 had a PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) 
≥50%, 20 subjects were PD-L1 TPS 1-49%), 4 subjects were PDL1 TPS <1%, and 5 were classified as PD-L1

Exposure-response analysis for safety 
A  prior  exposure-adverse  event  (AE)  analysis  was  conducted  by  pooling  across  all  subjects  included  in 
KEYNOTE-001,-002, -006 and -010, encompassing both melanoma and NSCLC indications. The potential for 
exposure-dependent immune-related AEs is not expected to be substantially influenced by indication, thus 
supporting a cross-indication pooled analysis. 
The primary focus of this analysis was evaluation of potential relationship between pembrolizumab exposure 
(AUC6wks) and the occurrence of AEs of special interest (AEOSIs). Additionally the analysis investigated 
covariates related to study design and disease severity as possible predictors for the AE response. More 
specifically, the following covariates were explored and tested during the analysis: duration of treatment, 
dosing  regimen,  randomization  status,  indication,  baseline  tumor  size,  ECOG  performance  status,  body 
weight, sex, EGFR status and PD-L1 status. Only data from pembrolizumab treatment arms of P001, P002, 
P006, P010 and P024 studies were included in the analysis. 
The  following  baseline  covariates  were  included  in  the  analysis  datasets:  duration  of  treatment,  dosing 
regimen, randomization status, indication, baseline tumor size, ECOG performance status, body weight, sex, 
EGFR status and PD-L1 status. The categorical covariates were coded in the dataset as follows: 
Dosing regimen (QW: Q2W=2, Q3W=3)  
Randomization status (RAND: randomized=1, non-randomized=0) 
Indication (CLDIAGN: Melanoma=1, NSCLC=2) 
ECOG status (BECOGN: 0 or 1) 
Sex (SEX: Male=1, Female=2) 
EGFR status (EGFR: 1=mutated, 0=not mutated) 
PD-L1 status (PDL1: 1=PD-L1-positive, 0=PD-L1-negative) 
Exposure at steady-state (AUCss) was calculated from the individual post hoc parameter estimates from the 
population  PK  model  by  the  ratio  of  total  dose  administered  in  one  dosing  interval  and  the  individual 
clearance parameter. Because the population PK clearance estimates are based on the complete time course 
of  individual  concentration  data,  these  AUCss  values  are  representative  of  the  average  steady-state 
exposure in an individual patient throughout the treatment. To account for differences in dosing frequency, 
AUC6wks was calculated as AUCssx2 or AUCssx3 for the Q3W or Q2W dosing regimen, respectively. 
The possibility of an exposure-response (ER) relationship was investigated by means of a logistic regression 
describing the frequency of AEs. The potential ER relationship characterization was further refined through 
logistic  regression  models  of  the  relationship  between  an  independent  variable  (here:  AUC6wks  or 
exposure) and a categorical dependent variable (here: the absence or presence of an AE).  
Data  from  2965  patients  (received  at  least  one  dose  of  pembrolizumab)  were  available  for  this 
exposure-safety analysis. In total, 81 patients were excluded due to missing exposure information. Of the 
resulting 2884 patients, 1191 belong to study P001, 340 to study P002, 548 to study P006, 653 to study 
P010 and 152 to study P024. No correlated covariates were included in the model. 
The potential presence of an exposure response relationship was investigated by means of bar plots of AE 
frequency vs bins of AUC6wks for different covariates. The factors that could influence the AE response can be 
divided  into  several  categories  1)  exposure  related  (AUC6wks,  dosing  regimen);  2)  study  design  related 
(treatment  duration,  randomization  status),  3)  disease  related  (indication,  baseline  tumour  size,  ECOG 
performance, EGFR status, PD-L1 status) and 4) demographic (sex, body weight).

When administered a fixed 200 mg dose regimen, a flat relationship between incidence of AEOSI across body 
weight (38-110 kg) in first-line NSCLC was observed, the number of subject with AEOSI ranged from 28.9% 
to 31.6%, suggesting the weight did not influence the AEOSI incidence. 
Instead,  there  is  evidence  for  a  correlation  between  exposure  and  treatment  duration;  in  the  higher 
exposure  group,  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  had  treatment  duration  above  the  median  (i.e.  longer 
treatment duration). The figure below reports the treatment duration versus AUC: 
Figure 10: Summary of treatment duration vs AUC in full dataset 
During visual inspection of the exploratory plots as well as stepwise covariate model building, the following 
covariates  were  investigated:  duration  of  treatment,  dosing  regimen,  randomization  status,  indication, 
baseline tumour size, ECOG performance status, body weight, sex, EGFR status and PD-L1 status. A specific 
component of the covariate analysis was to assess the importance of time (duration of treatment) for the 
occurrence of AEOSI. The  results of the stepwise covariate analysis (first forward addition) revealed the 
duration of treatment as the main covariate that was statistically significant on intercept, indicating that 
patients  with  longer  treatment  duration  have  somewhat  higher  probability  to  experience  an  AEOSI. 
Following inclusion of this covariate, no other covariate relationships were found to meet the criterion for 
inclusion in the model. 
Whereas a weight-based dose generally produces higher systemic exposures in subjects with heavier body 
weight,  the  trend  is  reversed  with  the  fixed  dose,  ie,  lower  body  weight  subjects  tend  to  have  higher 
exposures  on  a  fixed  200  mg  dose.  To  address  the  safety  risk  profile  for  lighter  body  weight  subjects 
receiving the 200 mg fixed dose, an exploration of the relationship between AEOSI and body weight was 
conducted.  The  figure  below  demonstrates  a  flat  relationship  between  incidence  of  AEOSI  across  body 
weight in first-line NSCLC, suggesting the lower weight subjects are not put at additional risk for AEOSI 
when administered a fixed 200 mg dose regimen.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  SmPC  of  pembrolizumab  reported  that  near  steady-state  concentrations  of  pembrolizumab  were 
achieved by 18 weeks; the median Cmin at 18 weeks was approximately 24 mcg/mL at a dose of 2 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks. Data from study P024 show that the median Ctrough (pre-dose) concentration at week 21 
is 32.7 mcg/mL at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. As expected, a slight difference in the pk parameters has 
been observed. This is in line with previous predictions of a 30% higher exposure than after 2 mg/kg Q3W. 
All the PK data collected during the study P024 were included in the previous population PK, called definitive 
population PK, and the parameters from the existing population  PK  model were re-estimated to obtain 
posthoc parameters for all the individuals included in this pooled dataset.  
However  the  conditional  number,  one  of  the  evaluation  model  parameter  used,  is  outside  the  range 
generally  accepted.  The  conditional  number  of  the  final  model  is  34.6  while  the  degree  of  collinearity 
between the parameter estimates is acceptable for a conditional number ≤20. Moreover the ETA shrinkage 
values are quite high, very close to the upper boundary of the generally accepted range (The shrinkage of 
the volume parameters is 27.7%). According to the MAH these shrinkage values could be due to limited 
information in the dataset to inform the individual estimation of these parameters. 
In order to verify the ability of the model to describe the new data, visual predictive checks were performed. 
The VPC  for Ctrough  concentrations in 200mg Q3W shows that the model tends to underpredict plasma 
concentrations: both median line and 95th percentile of observations are at higher concentrations values 
compared to the 90% CI of predictions. The VPC for peak concentrations in 200mg Q3W are poorly described 
by the model. The MAH performed a dedicated evaluation in order to assess potential origins of the model 
underprediction observed in the VPC (Report 04FYYY).  
Mainly the addition of time-dependency in pembrolizumab CL in the population PK model and the impact of 
censoring (dropout) on the performance of pembrolizumab population PK diagnostic results were explored 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 24/83 
 
 
as causes of the underprediction. Results showed that apparent on-study increases in concentration at time 
points long after treatment initiation are mostly attributable to informative censoring patterns. However due 
to the limitations of the analysis the potential for a small, true biologic time-dependency in pembrolizumab 
CL cannot be ruled out even though this time dependency is not clinically relevant and has no meaningful 
impact on assessment of intrinsic/extrinsic factor effects or exposure-response relationships. Based on this 
investigation, the static model is considered the definitive PK model used to interpret sparse concentration 
data collected in pembrolizumab trials to inform intrinsic and extrinsic factor effects and exposure-response 
characterizations.  
The predicted statistics for Cmax at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 200 mg Q3W dose regimen were 64.2 µg/mL and 85.6 
µg/mL respectively. The predicted statistics for steady state exposure parameters, both Ctrough and AUCss, 
6-week,  confirmed  the  finding  of  the  study  P024,  PK  exposure  parameters  after  200  mg  Q3W  are  slightly 
higher compared to 2 mg/kg Q3W.  
A comparison of the derived PK parameters was done also by first line (1L) NSCLC, second line (2L) NCSLC 
and Melanoma patients. The estimated CL is slightly lower for patients with melanoma, resulting in a slightly 
higher Vd, t1/2 and time to steady state. Thus the line of therapy did not affect PK parameters in NSCLC, but 
there was a difference in VD and CL between Melanoma and NCSLC patients in line with the results of the 
covariate  selection  procedure  indicating  the  additional  effect  of  cancer  type  (NSCLC  vs  melanoma)  on 
Volume of distribution. Therefore in the Clinical study report the MAH refers to the final model as the model 
having cancer type as covariate on CL and Vc. Overall, the model is considered adequate for the purpose of 
this variation. 
A  flat  concentration-efficacy  relationship  was  previously  demonstrated  for  NSCLC  with  the  Modelling  & 
Simulation Report “Model-based analysis of the relationship between pembrolizumab (MK-3475) exposure 
and efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in PN001 and PN010”.  
The ER analysis was performed in order to investigate the relationship between exposure to 
pembrolizumab in serum (i.e. AUCss-6weeks) and the anti-tumour response in first-line (1L) NSCLC. The 
number of subjects with TPS<50% is very low, so it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion about this 
subgroup of patients. For patients with TPS ≥50%, data indicate that the tumour response is not correlated 
to the AUCss-6wk.  
However, in the majority of patients (i.e. in all patients < 100 kg BW) the resulting exposure relative to body 
weight after a 200 mg flat dose is higher than 2 mg/kg (up to 4 mg/kg in a 50 kg patient). In contrast, 
heavier patients (> 100 kg body weight) receive a relative dose which is lower than after 2 mg/kg. However, 
considering  the limited number of patients with weight ≥100 kg (5 patients), no sound conclusion can be 
drawn based on available data. 
The  MAH  justifies  the  slightly  higher  incidence  of  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  against  pembrolizumab  in 
NSCLC relative to the melanoma indication as the results of the ongoing optimization of the immunogenicity 
assay framework, the majority of the NSCLC data were analysed with the most recent assay at PPD which 
has a higher tolerance level for the presence of pembrolizumab. However, analysing immunogenicity results 
stratified by treatment and indication, it can be observed that the higher incidence of ADA in NSCLC has been 
recorded also in 2mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups. Thus data suggests a slightly higher incidence of ADA in 
NSCLC. Overall, the incidence is low and any consequence on pembrolizumab exposure is unlikely. 
The  modelling  and  simulation  approach  is  being  applied  also  to  investigate  exposure-response 
relationships for safety. 
The Exposure-Adverse event analysis revealed that the flat dose do not increase the probability to have a 
AEOSI compared to the weight adjusted dosage. The duration of treatment was found to correlate with the 
occurrence of AEOSI.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Data from study P024 show that the median Ctrough concentration at steady state were slightly higher after 
dose of 200 mg Q3W (Ctrough at week 21 was 32.7 mcg/mL) compared to 2 mg/kg Q3W (Cmin at 18 weeks 
was approximately 24 mcg/mL). 
All the PK data collected during the study P024 were included in the previous population PK - “Model-based 
analysis of the relationship between pembrolizumab exposure and efficacy in patients with non-small-cell 
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in PN001 and PN010”.  
Overall, the model is adequate for the purpose of this variation. Results show that the line of therapy did not 
affect PK parameters in NSCLC, but there was a difference in VD and CL between Melanoma and NCSLC 
patients. The duration of treatment was found to correlate with the occurrence of AEOSI. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the Keytruda extension of indication as first line treatment in NSCLC, the second interim analysis 
(IA2) of the multicenter, international, open label study KEYNOTE-024 (P024), in which untreated patients 
were randomized to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg (fixed dose) or Investigator choice of pre-specified SOC 
(Standard  of  Care)  platinum  based  chemotherapies,  was  submitted  by  the  MAH.  Based  on  these  results 
(data cut-off date 9 May 2016), the trial was stopped per external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC)’s 
recommendation and pembrolizumab was offered to remaining subjects on the SOC arm.

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The pivotal study P024 is the first trial with pembrolizumab administered as 200 mg fixed dose. The choice 
of  this  dose  was  based  on  modelling  and  simulations  performed  using  the  population  PK  model  of 
pembrolizumab. Results showed that the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose provide exposures consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose Q3W, maintaining individual subject exposures in the range established in 
melanoma to be associated with maximal efficacy response and safety.  
In support of this submission, an exploratory analysis of tumour size change was conducted with all available 
data in treatment-naïve subjects with NSCLC to verify whether new data from subjects receiving the 200 mg 
fixed dose alters prior exposure-response assessments from the body weight-based dosing. All three major 
components of prior exposure-efficacy analyses (ie, the exploratory plots, exposure slope estimates from 
the model, and covariate-normalized simulations) were consistently in agreement.  
The rationale and results supporting the switch in the clinical development from a weight-based dose of 2 
mg/kg  to  a  200  mg  fixed  dose  of  pembrolizumab  administered  every  3  weeks  (Q3W)  are  discussed  in 
Section on PK/PD modelling.

•  Age ≥18 years 
• 
• 
• 
ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 
Life expectancy ≥3 months 
Provided formalin fixed tumour tissue sample from a biopsy of a tumour lesion either at the time of 
or  after  the  diagnosis  of  metastatic  disease  had  been  made  AND  from  a  site  not  previously

irradiated, to assess for PD-L1 status. The tissue sample was to be received by the central vendor 
prior  to  randomization.  Fine  needle  aspirates,  endobronchial  ultrasound,  or  cell  blocks  were  not 
acceptable. Needle or excisional biopsies, or resected tissue was required. 
• 
Investigators were to be able to produce the source documentation of the EGFR mutation and ALK 
translocation status in all subjects with non-squamous histologies AND for subjects in whom testing 
was  clinically  recommended.  If  either  an  EGFR  sensitizing  mutation  or  ALK  translocation  was 
detected,  additional  information  regarding  the  mutation  status  of  the  other  molecule  was  not 
required. If unable to test for these molecular changes, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour 
tissue of any age were to be submitted to a central laboratory designated by the Sponsor for such 
testing.  Subjects  with  non-squamous  histologies  were  not  randomized  until  the  EGFR  mutation 
status  and/or  ALK  translocation  status  was  available  in  source  documentation  at  the  site.  For 
subjects  enrolled  who  were  known  to  have  a  tumour  of  predominantly  squamous  histology, 
molecular testing for EGFR and ALK translocation was not required. 
• 
PD-L1 strong tumour (TPS≥50%) as determined by IHC at a central laboratory. 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  Systemic  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  their  stage  IV  NSCLC.  Completion  of  treatment  with 
chemotherapy  and/or  radiation  as  part  of  neoadjuvant/adjuvant  therapy  was  allowed  as  long  as 
therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease. 
•  Current or previous participation in a study of an investigational agent, with study therapy received 
or investigation device used within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 
• 
Tumor  specimen  not  evaluable  for  PD-L1  expression  by  the  central  laboratory.  If  an  additional 
tumour specimen was submitted AND evaluable for PD-L1 expression, the subject was eligible to 
participate if PD-L1 expression was assessed as “strong” by the central laboratory. 
•  Systemic  steroid  therapy  <3  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  trial  treatment  or  any  other  form  of 
immunosuppressive  medication  (corticosteroid  use  on  study  for  management  of  ECIs,  as 
pre-medication  for  the  control  chemotherapies,  and/or  a  premedication  for  IV  contrast 
allergies/reactions were allowed). Subjects who were receiving daily steroid replacement therapy 
served as an exception to this rule.  
•  Requirement  of  any  other  form  of  systemic  or  localized  antineoplastic  therapy  while  on  trial 
(including maintenance therapy with another agent for NSCLC, radiation therapy, and/or surgical 
resection). 
• 
• 
Prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, OR major surgery within 3 weeks of the 
first dose of trial treatment; thoracic radiation therapy of >30 Gy received within 6 months of the 
first dose of trial treatment. 
Prior  therapy  with  an  anti-PD-1,  anti-PD-L1,  anti-PD-L2,  anti-CD137,  or  anti-cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody 
or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways). 
•  Untreated  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  metastases  and/or  carcinomatous  meningitis.  Subjects 
whose  brain  metastases  have  been  treated  were  allowed  to  participate  provided  they  showed 
radiographic stability. In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the 
brain metastases or their treatment had to be returned to baseline or resolved.  
•  Active autoimmune disease that had required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of 
disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). 
•  Allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant. 
•  Administration of live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first administration of study medication  
Treatments 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30 minute (-5, +10) IV infusion Q3W. 
• 
•  SOC chemotherapies:  
o  Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Q3W and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min Q3W on Day 1, for 4

to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Q3W (for non-squamous histologies 
only) 
o  Pemetrexed  500  mg/m2  Q3W  and  cisplatin  75  mg/m2  Q3W  on  Day  1,  for  4  to  6  cycles 
followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Q3W (for non-squamous histologies only)

cycles 
o  Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 at Days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min Q3W on 
Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles 
o  Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 Q3W and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min Q3W on Day 1 for 4 to 6 
cycles  followed  by  optional  pemetrexed  maintenance  (pemetrexed  maintenance  for 
non-squamous histologies only) 
The specific platinum doublet (including whether pemetrexed maintenance was offered for those subjects 
with non-squamous histologies) as well as the dose (for example, AUC 5 OR 6 mg/mL/min for carboplatin) 
to be administered was identified prior to randomization. 
Subjects continued with the assigned study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression of disease as 
determined by BICR review, unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent illness that prevented further administration 
of treatment, Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdrew consent, pregnancy of the 
subject,  non-compliance  with  trial  treatment  or  procedure  requirements,  administrative  reasons,  or  the 
subject had received 35 trial treatments of pembrolizumab. Treatment could have been continued despite 
RECIST 1.1 defined progression if the subject was  clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical 
benefit by the Investigator. 
Pembrolizumab-treated subjects who attained a confirmed complete response (CR) could consider stopping 
trial treatment. These subjects, as well as those subjects assigned to the pembrolizumab arm who stopped 
trial  therapy  after  35  trial  treatments  for  reasons  other  than  disease  progression  or  intolerability,  were 
eligible  for  re-treatment  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  Second  Course  Phase  after  they  experienced 
radiographic disease progression at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Objectives 
The study primary objective was to compare the PFS, per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central 
radiologists’  review  (BICR),  of  pembrolizumab  to  SOC  chemotherapies  in  subjects  with  PD-L1  strong, 
previously untreated metastatic NSCLC. 
The secondary objectives included the comparison of OS, ORR (RECIST 1.1 by BICR) and safety/tolerability 
in pembrolizumab and SOC groups. 
Other exploratory objectives were to compare pembrolizumab and SOC chemotherapies in terms of PFS and 
ORR per irRC, PFS per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator in the next line of therapy (PFS2, second progression free 
survival),  response  duration  per  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR  and  per  irRC,  and  to  evaluate  patient-reported 
treatment  effects  at  pre-specified  time  points  while  on  treatment  and  post-discontinuation  (EQ-5D-3L; 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13), Quality adjusted Time without Symptoms or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) and genomic 
signature that predict for response in pembrolizumab treated patients. 
Comparison  of  the  time  to  progression  while  on  the  control  arm  to  the  time  to  progression  following 
crossover to pembrolizumab was included as an exploratory objective in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), 
but this analysis was not conducted. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented 
disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  
As secondary endpoints, OS and ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR were evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 29/83 
 
OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects without documented 
death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. 
ORR was defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who have a complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR), based upon blinded independent central radiologists’ review per RECIST 1.1. 
Among the planned exploratory endpoints, results have been submitted for: 
Time to response, defined as the time from randomization to the first assessment of CR or PR. 
• 
•  Response duration, defined as the time from the first CR/PR to documented PD.  
Only confirmed CR/PRs were included in the analysis for time to response and response duration. Subjects 
who did not have PD were censored at the time of the last disease response assessment. 
• 
PRO at pre-specified time points while on treatment (every cycle for the first three cycles and every 
third cycle, 9 weeks,  thereafter until PD) and post-discontinuation (at Treatment Discontinuation 
Visit and 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit) as measured by changes from baseline in all domains and 
single  items  of  European  Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) Core 30 (C30) and Lung Cancer 13 (LC13), with particular emphasis on 
EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL domain, chest pain, cough, and dyspnoea. 
Sample size 
The study was event-driven and planned to randomize approximately 300 subjects with 1:1 ratio into the 
pembrolizumab arm and the SOC arm. One analysis of ORR, one analysis of PFS and two analyses of OS (one 
interim at the time of PFS analysis, and one final) were planned. The overall type I error rate for this study 
was strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided). The sample size calculation was based on PFS with the following 
assumptions: 1) PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5.5 months in the control arm, 2) 
hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.55, 3) enrollment period of 14 months and at least 6 
months PFS follow-up after enrollment completion, and 4) a dropout rate of 10% per year.   
The first planned analysis (the ORR analysis) had to be conducted after first 191 subjects had a minimum of 
6 months of follow up. This analysis had ~95% power to detect a 30% difference in ORR (e.g., 32% in SOC 
vs. 62% in pembrolizumab) at alpha=0.5%. In case this analysis resulted not significant, 0.5% of the 2.5% 
alpha had to be spent at the subsequent PFS and OS analyses to strictly control the overall type I error rate 
of the study [See below Section on Statistical Methods]. 
The planned PFS analysis had to be conducted after approximately 175 PFS events were observed between 
the pembrolizumab arm and control. If there were less than 110 OS events at the time, the analysis could 
have been delayed for up to 2 months or when the target OS number was reached, whichever occurred first. 
With  ~175  PFS  events,  the  study  had  ~98%  [97%]  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  0.55  at  alpha  = 
2.5%[2%] (one-sided) at the PFS analysis, respectively, depending on the alpha spent at the ORR analysis. 
With ~110 OS events at the interim OS analysis, the study had ~60% power to demonstrate a numerically 
positive OS effect when the true hazard ratio is 0.7 assuming that half of the subjects in the control arm 
crossed over to pembrolizumab at the time of analysis.  
The  final  OS  analysis  had  to  be  conducted  after  approximately  170  deaths  had  occurred  between  the 
pembrolizumab arm and control. The final OS analysis was expected to occur 14 months after enrolment 
completion. With 170 deaths at final OS analysis, the study had ~75% power to observe a hazard ratio < 1 
assuming that ~70% of the subjects in the control arm crossed over to pembrolizumab. The calculation was 
based on the following assumptions: 1) overall survival follows an exponential distribution with a median of 
13 months in the control arm, 2) hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.7, 3) an enrolment 
period of 14 months and 14-15 months follow-up after enrolment completion, and 4) a dropout rate of 0.005 
per month. With two planned OS analyses, i.e., ~110 OS events at final PFS analysis and ~170 OS events  
at  final OS analysis, the study had approximately 60%[57%] power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 with the 
overall alpha controlled at 2.5%[2.0%] (one-sided).

Randomisation 
Patients were centrally assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to pembrolizumab and SOC, using an interactive 
voice response system/integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Randomization was to be stratified 
by geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia), ECOG status (0 vs. 1) and histology (squamous vs. 
non-squamous).

Statistical methods 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  is  based  on  the  intention-to-treat  (ITT) 
population. The overall type I error rate for this study is strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided). One analysis 
of ORR, one analysis of PFS and two analyses of OS (one interim at the time of PFS analysis, and one final) 
were planned. The ORR analysis was planned when the first 191 randomized subjects had a minimum of 6 
months of follow up, and was to be tested at the 0.5% (one-sided) alpha level. PFS was to be tested only 
once at the planned PFS analysis after ~175 PFS events were observed, and was to be tested at the 2.5% 
(one-sided) level if ORR testing was positive or at the 2.0% (one-sided) level if ORR testing was negative. OS 
was to be tested only if PFS was positive and at the same level, but proportional to the number of events at 
its  interim  analysis  relative  to  the  target  final  analysis  number  of  events.  A  Hwang-Shih-DeCani 
alpha-spending function with the gamma parameter -0.4 and beta-spending function with gamma -35 was 
constructed to implement group sequential boundaries.  
Table 11: Analysis Strategy for the key Efficacy Endpoints 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The 
treatment difference in PFS is assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard 
model with Efron’s method of tie handling is used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., 
hazard  ratio)  between  the  treatment  arms.  The  hazard  ratio  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  from  the 
stratified Cox model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate is reported. 
The same stratification factors used for randomization (East Asia vs non-East Asia, ECOG PS 0 vs 1, and 
squamous histology vs. non-squamous) are applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox 
model. 
Sensitivity analyses, with a different set of censoring rules, are performed for comparison of PFS based on

investigator’s assessment. Sensitivity analysis 1 is the same as the primary analysis except that it censors 
at the last disease assessment without PD when PD or death is documented after more than one missed 
disease  assessment.  Sensitivity  analysis  2  is  the  same  as  the  primary  analysis  except  that  it  considers 
discontinuation of treatment or initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs later, to be a PD 
event for subjects without documented PD or death. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses 
are summarized in the following table. 
Table 12: Censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses of PFS 
 Overall Survival (OS) 
The Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate the survival curves. The treatment difference in survival is 
assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie 
handling is used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the hazard ratio). The hazard 
ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate are 
reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization are applied to both the stratified log-rank 
test and the stratified Cox model. Since subjects in the control arm were expected to discontinue from the 
study  earlier  compared  to  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  arm  because  of  earlier  onset  of  PD,  with  a 
possibility to switch to the pembrolizumab treatment after the confirmed progressive disease, it was planned 
to use the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model to adjust for the effect of crossover on OS. 
To further account for the possible confounding effect, it was also planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis 
of  OS  censoring  subjects  at  the  time  of  initiation  of  new  therapy  and  an  additional  analysis  that  treats 
initiation of new therapy as a time-dependent binary covariate. 
For both PFS and OS, subgroup analyses, to determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across 
various subgroups, are conducted on the following classification variables: Age category (≤65, >65 years); 
Sex (female, male); Race (white, non-white); ECOG status (0, 1); Geographic region of enrolling site (East 
Asia, non-East Asia); Histology (squamous, non-squamous); Smoking status (never, former, current); Brain 
metastasis  status  (baseline  brain  metastasis,  no  baseline  brain  metastasis);  Investigators’  choice  of 
standard of care chemotherapy.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
The Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method (weighted with sample size) is used for comparison of the 
objective response rates between the treatment groups.  A 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
response rates between the pembrolizumab arm and the control as well as the p-value is provided. The same 
stratification factors used for randomization are applied to the analysis. Sensitivity analyses are performed 
for comparison of ORR based on investigator’s assessment.  
Exploratory endpoints  
Time to response/Duration of response 
Response duration is summarized descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians. Response rate at specific time 
points (for example, 6 months etc.) based on Kaplan-Meier method are summarized. Only the combined 
subset of subjects who show a confirmed complete or partial response are included in this analysis. For 
subjects who cross over to pembrolizumab after disease progression on the control arm, time to progression 
while on the control arm was planned to be compared to the time to progression following crossover, where 
the time to progression following crossover is defined as the time from time of crossover to the earliest 
documented disease progression.  
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
The key PRO endpoints are the mean score changes from baseline to week 15 as measured by the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and the Time to deterioration (TTD) in the composite endpoint of cough (LC13-Q1), chest pain 
(LC13-Q10) and dyspnoea (LC13-Q3-5). Although no formal hypothesis is formulated, the nominal p-value 
is  provided  for  treatment  comparisons  of  pembrolizumab  vs.  SOC  for  PRO  endpoints.  No  multiplicity 
adjustment is performed. Longitudinal and descriptive data analysis are used to evaluate patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs). Several approaches are considered to address the issue of informative missing data. 
Supportive  PRO  endpoints  are  the  mean  score  changes,  and  the  number  and  proportions  of 
deterioration/stable/improvement  from  baseline  to  week  15  specifically  related  to:  (1)  EORTC  QLQ-C30 
global health status/quality of life scale (the number and proportions of deterioration/stable/improvement 
only);  (2)  Each  EORTC  QLQ-C30  functional  subscale:  physical  functioning,  role  functioning,  emotional 
functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning; (3) Each EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom subscale score: 
Fatigue, Nausea and vomiting, Pain, Dyspnoea, Insomnia, Appetite loss, Constipation, Diarrhoea; (4) Each 
EORTCQLQ-LC13  item:  pain,  coughing,  sore  mouth,  dysphagia,  peripheral  neuropathy,  alopecia,  and 
haemoptysis  (mean  score  changes  from  baseline  only);  (5)The  EORTC  QLQ-LC13  dyspnoea  multi-item 
sub-scale (mean score changes from baseline only).

Results 
Participant flow 
Among 500 patients screened as PD-L1 TPS≥50%, only 305 have been enrolled. Most of the PD-L1  strongly 
positive screen failure patients (39%) were not randomized because the evaluation of PD-L1 status was 
performed  in  tissue  specimens  not  permitted  by  the  protocol,  or  the  tissue  sample  was  obtained  from 
irradiated  lesions,  or  prior  to  the  diagnosis  of  metastatic  disease  or  prior  to  administration  of  systemic 
therapy. The provided information reassures on the correctness of patients selection.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population, including all randomized subjects (305 patients), served as the primary population for 
both primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
For the analysis of pre-specified exploratory PRO endpoints, a specific Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, 
that consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and completed 
at least one PRO instrument (299 patients), was considered. 
The All Subject as Treated (AsaT) population, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of study treatment (304 patients) was used for the analysis of safety data. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  data  cut-off  date  for  the  submitted  analysis  (IA2)  was  on  9  May  2016,  with  a  median  duration  of 
follow-up of 11 months (range 6.3 to 19.7 months).

Compliance  rates  for  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  EORTC  QLQ-LC13  at  baseline  were  above  90%  in  the  two 
treatment  arms  and  close  to  80%  at  week  15,  with  a  slightly  lower  rate  in  the  SOC  than  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm. As expected, completion rates continued to decrease at each time point.

The longitudinal score changes from baseline to week 15 in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL and 
functioning scales and symptom scales are reported in the following tbles:

The association of disease progression with subsequent score changes for global health status/QoL was also 
explored. Among subjects without disease progression, there was a greater improvement in global health 
status/QoL score from baseline to Week 15 for pembrolizumab compared to SOC whereas among subjects

with disease progression, there was less worsening in health status/QoL score from baseline to Week 15 for 
pembrolizumab than for SOC (see Table below).

With few exceptions, changes from baseline to Week 15 in EORTC functioning and symptom domains were 
numerically superior for pembrolizumab arms compared to SOC and several, including fatigue, peripheral 
neuropathy, alopecia, and chest pain, were nominally significant (i.e., 95% CI did not overlap).

Sensitivity  analysis  1  is  the  same  as  the  primary  analysis  except  that  it  censors  at  the  last  disease 
assessment without PD when PD or death is documented after more than one missed disease assessment 
(see Table 12 for further details).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the NSCLC therapeutic scenario, pembrolizumab already plays its role being approved for the treatment 
of locally advanced or metastatic disease in PD-L1 positive patients who have received at least one prior 
chemotherapy regimen, including approved target therapy for EGFR and ALK aberrations in case of positive 
tumour mutations. 
This application has been submitted to extend the Keytruda indication to the treatment of PD-L1 positive 
(TPS≥50%) metastatic NSCLC in patients previously untreated. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support the pembrolizumab efficacy in the first line NSCLC setting, the MAH submitted results from one 
single,  phase  III,  randomized,  pivotal  study  (KEYNOTE-024),  comparing  pembrolizumab  to  a  SOC 
platinum-based doublet that was selected by the investigator at the time of randomization among 5 different 
options (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, for 4 
to 6 cycles followed by optional maintenance pemetrexed, in non-squamous histologies only; gemcitabine 
1250 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, for 4 to 6 
cycles; paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min day 1, for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by 
optional  maintenance  pemetrexed  only  in  non-squamous  histologies).  Platinum-based  chemotherapy 
regimen is still the standard of care for the first line treatment of NSCLC not harbouring EGFR activating 
mutations and ALK translocations, with no major differences in efficacy across combination. The control arm 
is therefore considered adequate. 
A  fixed  dose  regimen  of  pembrolizumab  200  mg  has  been  first  administered  in  this  study,  based  on 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 46/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
modelling  and  simulations  showing  consistent  exposure  compared  to  that  obtained  with  weight-based 
pembrolizumab dose (2 mg/kg). This flat dose is currently being used for the whole pembrolizumab clinical 
development, including several different indications in solid and haematological malignancies.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS, with OS, ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, and safety as secondary 
endpoints. Time to response, Response Duration and PROs were also included as exploratory endpoints. 
The study had 97% power to detect a hazard ratio 0.55 at alpha = 2.5% (one-sided) at the PFS analysis. An 
interim ORR analysis (IA1) was planned with alpha strictly controlled. With ~110 OS events at the time of 
the  final  PFS  analysis,  an  interim  OS  analysis  (IA2)  was  planned  with  ~60%  power    to  demonstrate  a 
numerically positive OS effect when the true hazard ratio is 0.7 assuming that half of the subjects in the 
control  arm  crossed  over  to  pembrolizumab  at  the  time  of  analysis.  All  the  provided  assumptions  are 
comprehensive and adequate for a proper determination of the study sample size. The statistical methods 
are overall adequate. A more compelling overall type I error rate (strictly < 2.5% one-sided) to meet the 
statistical  requirements  for  proper  design  of  a  One  Pivotal  Study  could  have  been  used.  However,  this 
limitation should be put in the right perspective considering the target magnitude of benefit and the reported 
clinical results. 
Overall,  eligibility  criteria  clearly  define  the  target  population.  Among  500  patients  screened  as  PD-L1 
TPS≥50%, only 305 have been enrolled. Most of the PD-L1 strongly positive screen failure patients (39%) 
were not randomized due to issues related to the tissue samples used for the evaluation of PD-L1 status.  
Baseline characteristics were overall well balanced, apart from smoking status (“never-smokers”: 12.6% vs. 
3.2%  in  SOC  and  pembrolizumab,  respectively),  and  brain  metastases  (6.6%  vs  11.7%  in  SOC  and 
pembrolizumab, respectively). 
Patients with ECOG performance status score ≥ 2 were excluded from KEYNOTE-024 similarly to what has 
been  done  in  studies  supporting  approval  of  the  other  indications  (see  sections  4.2,  4.4  and  5.1  of  the 
SmPC). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results of the IA2, on which basis the eDMC recommended to stop the study, have been provided.  
At  the  provided  cut-off  date  (9  May  2016),  the  median  duration  of  follow-up  was  11  months  (6.3-19.7 
months). A clinically significant improvement was reported with pembrolizumab compared to SOC in terms 
of PFS (10.3 vs 6.0 months, HR: 0.50, p<0.001), with 6-month and 12-month PFS rates of 62.1% vs 50.3% 
and  47%  vs  15%,  respectively.  Although  44%  of  patients  in  the  control  group  crossed  over  to 
pembrolizumab, a considerable advantage was observed in OS (HR: 0.60, p=0.005; 12-month OS rate: 
69.9%  vs  54.2%).  The  median  OS  was  not  reached  in  either  arm  possibly  due  to  significant  rate  of 
crossover. The CHMP considered that available OS data should be included in the SmPC, taking into account 
the median follow-up of almost 12 months (near to what expected with standard treatment in the target 
population) and the rate of OS events already observed in the control arm (42.4%). Results from an OS 
analysis, based on 170 death events, will be available approximately in June 2018. 
The applicant is recommended to provide further information on patients who crossed over from SOC arm to 
pembrolizumab together with the submission of the final report of KEYNOTE-024 expected approximately in 
June 2018. 
Pembrolizumab  was  superior  also  in  terms  of  confirmed  ORR  (44.8%  vs  27.8%).  Interestingly,  no 
differences  in  the  median  time  to  response  were  observed,  with  early  onset  (2.2.  months,  i.e.  the  first 
planned tumour assessment) in both arms. A DoR of at least 9 months was reported in more than 80% of the 
responders in the pembrolizumab arm vs 36.2% in the SOC arm. Provided sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
support the primary results, with the exception of finding in the subgroup of female patients where a reduced 
effect  in  terms  of  both  PFS  (HR:  0.75,  95%CI:  0.46-1.21)  and  OS  (HR:  0.95,  95%CI:0.50-1.83)  was 
Assessment report

Page 47/83 
 
observed. However, based on available data the observed effect could be a chance finding due to small 
numbers. In addition, a smaller benefit was observed with pembrolizumab in never smokers NSCLC patients 
however, due to the small number of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. This 
information has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The key PRO endpoints are the mean score changes from baseline to week 15 as measured by the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 and the Time to deterioration (TTD) in the composite endpoint of cough (LC13-Q1), chest pain 
(LC13-Q10) and dyspnoea (LC13-Q3-5). No formal hypothesis was formulated. The 15 week time point was 
selected to minimize loss of data due to death or disease progression. This is acknowledged. However, the 
relatively short time-frame covered by the submitted results from this exploratory analysis provide limited 
information on the short term effect. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based  on  provided  data,  the  efficacy  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  treatment  of  PD-L1  strongly  positive 
previously untreated NSCLC patients is considered demonstrated.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The known pembrolizumab safety profile, to date evaluated in 2,799 patients, including 1,567 with advanced 
melanoma and 1,232 with advanced NSCLC, is mainly associated with immune-related adverse reactions 
and characterized by general (fatigue), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea and nausea), skin (rash and pruritus) and 
musculoskeletal  (arthralgia)  disorders.  The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  reported  were of  Grade  1  or 2 
severity and the most serious were immune-related adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions.  
The primary safety analyses in the pivotal study KEYNOTE-024 has been conducted in the All Subject as 
Treated  (AsaT)  population  including  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
treatment. Adverse events (AEs) observed in the 66 patients who received pembrolizumab as part of the in 
study crossover (cut-off date 9 May 2016) were not submitted by the MAH. 
Patient exposure 
In study KEYNOTE-024, the median exposure to treatment was 214.00 days (mean 205.73, SD 144.93) for 
patients who received pembrolizumab compared to 106.00 days (mean 120.83, SD 105.94) for those in the 
SOC arm. The breakdown of chemotherapy regimens administered in the SOC arm by histology is shown in 
the table below. 
The most common chemotherapy regimen was pemetrexed in combination with carboplatin received by 66

patients (44%). The majority of non-squamous NSCLC patients were administered a pemetrexed containing 
doublet (102 patients, 83%), and 46 of them (37%) received pemetrexed maintenance. 
Overall, 87 subjects in the pembrolizumab arm compared to 29 subjects in the SOC arm received treatment 
for ≥6 months, and the treatment was administered ≥12 months respectively in 23 and 5 patients (see 
Table below). 
Table 25: Exposure by Duration (AsaT Population) 
Adverse events 
Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 19.0. 
The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach. The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will 
be performed. Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates with 95% confidence intervals provided 
for between-group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group were provided for Tier 3 safety 
parameters. There are no Tier 1 safety analyses in this study. No p-values would be provided for safety 
comparison. 
The following Table displays an overview of the numbers and percentages of subjects in the AsaT population 
who had AEs up to 30 days and SAEs up to 90 days after the last dose of study medication:

Drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs 
The Table below shows the number of subjects with drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (incidence ≥1% in one or 
more treatment groups).

The incidence of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events in patients treated with pembrolizumab across studies KN001, 
KN002, KN006, KN010 and KN024 is reported in the Table below.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
The  analysis  of  AEOSI  was  the  primary  method  of  assessing  irAEs  and  was  based  on  a  compiled  list  of 
preferred AE terms potentially associated with an immune aetiology. The list of terms is updated periodically 
based on emerging pembrolizumab safety data. 
The currently applied AEOSI term list is reported below: 
Table 33: Adverse Events of Special Interest Preferred Terms (v10.2 RMST 02-MAY-2016) 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 57/83 
 
 
 
AEOSI  were  more  common  among  pembrolizumab-treated  subjects  compared  to  SOC-treated  subjects 
(29.2% vs. 4.7%, respectively). A majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, with 9.7% of 
pembrolizumab-treated subjects experiencing Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI. There were no deaths reported due to 
AEOSI  in  either  treatment  group.  Six  (3.9%)  subjects  discontinued  due  to  drug-related  AEOSI  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm and none in the SOC arm.

The concomitant systemic corticosteroid use for AEOSI is summarized in the following table. 
Table 36: Use of concomitant corticosteroids for AEOSI 
Source: CSR Table 14-29 to Table 14-52; *For 2 of 10 pneumonitis episodes (obviously one patient had two events) a low starting dose was used (30 mg/day), 
for all other patients a high starting dose of corticosteroid treatment was applied (defined as ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent).

The median time to onset of hyperthyroidism was 1.4 months (range 1 day to 21.9 months). The median 
duration was 2.0 months (range 10 days to 15.0+ months). Hyperthyroidism led to discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab in 2 (<0.1%) patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 82 (76%) patients. 
All subjects in the pembrolizumab arm who developed hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism were assessed for 
a history of thyroid disorders, history of radiation to the neck/thyroid gland, and baseline thyroid stimulating 
hormone. Of the 12 subjects who developed hyperthyroidism, all had a normal TSH level at baseline and 
none had received radiation to their neck or thyroid gland prior to the onset of their hyperthyroidism. One 
subject did have a history of goiter; however, this subject had a normal TSH at baseline and was on no 
thyroid therapy prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. Furthermore, the majority of the hyperthyroidism 
cases was Grade 1, did not require treatment interruption or steroid therapy, and responded to anti-thyroid 
therapy. Eleven of the twelve cases of hyperthyroidism in the pembrolizumab arm had resolved at the time 
of the database cut-off.

The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 18.9 months). The median 
duration  was  not  reached  (range  2 days  to  27.7+ months).  One  patient  (< 0.1%)  discontinued 
pembrolizumab due to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism resolved in 49 (20%) patients. 
In the 14 subjects who developed hypothyroidism, 7 subjects had a preceding history of hyperthyroidism 
that developed while on pembrolizumab. Of the remaining 7 subjects, one had a history of hypothyroidism 
and was on thyroid replacement prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. A second subject had a mildly 
elevated  TSH  at  baseline  but  otherwise  no  history  of  thyroid  disorders  or  radiation  to  the  neck.  The 
remaining five subjects had no medical history of thyroid abnormalities, had not received radiation to the 
neck and had normal TSH levels prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. Steroid treatment was not required

Deaths 
Overall, there were 16 deaths (9 in the pembrolizumab arm and 7 in the SOC arm) due to an AE, including  
4 events, 1 in the pembrolizumab arm (sudden death) and 3 in the SOC arm (pulmonary sepsis, death, 
pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage) considered by Investigators as related to the study treatment. 
Table 47: Subjects with AEs resulting in Death by decreasing incidence (Incidence >0% in One or More 
Treatment Groups) AsaT Population 
One death was considered related to pembrolizumab treatment by the Investigator. However, in the opinion 
of  the  MAH,  based  on  the  clinically  relevant  information  currently  available  for  this  individual  case,  the 
reported event was considered unlikely related to the study medication.  A causality assessment is limited by 
confounding factors including recent ECG findings of myocardial infarction, internal jugular vein clot, history 
of diabetes mellitus, and the underlying metastatic malignancy. 
Laboratory findings 
A  shift  analysis  on  laboratory  abnormalities  with  the  highest  CTCAE  grade  was  performed.  A  clinically 
meaningful worsening was defined as a shift from less than Grade 3 to Grade 3, 4, or 5 or a shift from Grade 
0 to Grade 2. No clinically meaningful change in the percentage of subjects with worsening of laboratory 
abnormalities was observed for subjects treated with pembrolizumab. 
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in pembrolizumab arm were magnesium decreased 
(41.7%),  glucose  increased  (35.9%),  lymphocytes  decreased  (35.8%),  albumin  decreased  (33.3%), 
phosphate decreased (33.3%) and haemoglobin decreased (31.7%).  
The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in the SOC arm were leukocytes decreased (80%), 
haemoglobin decreased (73.9%), glucose increased (52.3%) lymphocytes decreased (47.5%), phosphate

common  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruption  were  neutropenia  (8.0%),  neutrophil  count  decreased 
(7.3%), anemia (6.7%), and platelet count decreased (4.0%).  
The incidence of drug-related treatment discontinuation due to AE was 7.1% in the pembrolizumab arm and 
10.7% in the SOC group.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  data  from  patients  in  the  pivotal  KEYNOTE-024  study,  comparing  pembrolizumab  to  SOC 
chemotherapy  (5  optional  platinum-based  doublets)  in  previously  untreated  NSCLC  patients,  have  been 
submitted. Overall, 154 patients were treated with pembrolizumab and 150 patients received SOC (cut-off 
date 9 May 2016). In addition, analyses on the overall safety database, including data from 2,953 patients 
who  received  pembrolizumab  across  studies  KN001,  KN002,  KN006,  KN010  and  KN024  have  been 
submitted to support the update of Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The median exposure to treatment was doubled for patients in the pembrolizumab arm compared to that in 
the SOC arm (214.00 days vs 106.00 days, respectively). Although the number of patients and the provided 
data for long-term exposure of pembrolizumab are limited in the first-line NSCLC setting, the safety data 
base can be considered sufficient to support this extension of indication, taking the overall safety data and 
the already available data for NSCLC into account. The safety data for NSCLC will be further expanded by

several  currently  on-going  phase  III  studies  in  NSCLC  in  the  1L  and  adjuvant  setting  (pembrolizumab 
treatment with 200 mg flat dose three-weekly in all ongoing studies). 
No major differences in baseline characteristics were observed across arms, with the exception of smoking 
status and brain metastases (“never-smokers”: 12.6% vs 3.2%; brain metastases: 6.6% vs 11.7%, in SOC 
and pembrolizumab arms, respectively). 
Overall, the safety of pembrolizumab positively compares with that of SOC chemotherapy. Although in the 
two arms a comparable number of patients experienced AEs (96.1% with pembrolizumab and 96.7% with 
SOC), a lower rate of drug-related AEs (73.4% vs 90%), drug-related Grade ≥3 AEs (26.6% vs 53.3%), and 
treatment  discontinuation  due  to  drug-related  AEs  (7.1%  vs  10.7%)  occurred  in  patients  treated  with 
pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy.  
Pembrolizumab showed a safety profile consistent with what previously reported, and well different from 
that of chemotherapy. The analysis of risk difference between arms for the most common AEs was clearly in 
favour of pembrolizumab for some events (i.e, Blood creatinine increased, Stomatitis, White blood cell count 
decreased, Dysgeusia, Platelet count decreased, Thrombocytopenia, Decreased appetite, Neutrophil count 
decreased, Fatigue, Vomiting, Neutropenia, Nausea and Anaemia), while was in favour of chemotherapy for 
others (i.e, Pruritus, Rash and Nasopharyngitis).  
In the pembrolizumab arm, the most commonly reported AEs were Dyspnoea (22.1%), Diarrhoea (20.8%), 
Constipation (20.8%), Fatigue (20.8%) and Decreased appetite (20.1%), while in patients treated with SOC 
chemotherapy  the  most  frequent  AEs  were  Anaemia  (52.7%),  Nausea  (46.7%),  Fatigue  (35.3%), 
Decreased  appetite  (32.7%),  Neutropenia  (24%),  Vomiting  (24%),  Constipation  (22.7%)  and  Diarrhoea 
(22%).  In  terms  of  drug-related  AEs,  the  most  frequently  reported  were  Diarrhoea  (14.3%)  Fatigue 
(10.4%) and Pyrexia (10.4%) with pembrolizumab, while in the chemotherapy arm Anaemia (44%), Nausea 
(43.3%),  Fatigue  (28.7%),  Decreased  appetite  (26%),  Neutropenia  (22.7%)  and  Vomiting  (20%)  were 
more commonly observed.  
A lower rate of drug-related Grade≥3 AEs was reported with pembrolizumab compared to the chemotherapy 
arm (26.6% vs 53.3%). The drug-related Grade≥3 AEs occurred more commonly in patients treatment with 
pembrolizumab were Diarrhoea (3.9% vs 1.3%) and Pneumonitis (2.6% vs 0.7%). 
As  expected,  a  higher  incidence  of  AEOSI,  including  immune-mediated  AEs,  was  registered  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm compared to chemotherapy (29.2% vs 4.7%), and the most frequently reported events 
were Hypothyroidism (9.1% vs 1.3%), Hyperthyroidism (7.8% vs 1%), Pneumonitis (5.8% vs 0.7%) and 
Infusion reactions (4.5% vs 1.3%). Events were mostly mild, and Grade ≥3 AEOSI was reported in 9.7% of 
patients treated with pembrolizumab. 
In line with previously submitted data of pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients, the most common drug-related 
SAE  was  Pneumonitis  (4.5%);  Anaemia  (2.7%)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  with  chemotherapy. 
Overall, 16 patients (9 in the pembrolizumab arm and 7 in the control group) died due to AEs. None of the 
AE  leading  to  death  occurred  more  than  once.  Four  fatal  cases,  including  1  patient  treated  with 
pembrolizumab (sudden death), were considered related to study treatment by the investigator.  
In  pembrolizumab  treated  patients,  no  clinically  meaningful  change  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with 
worsening of laboratory abnormalities was observed.   
No major and unexpected differences in the tolerability of pembrolizumab treatment were observed across 
the  different  class of  age and  ECOG  PS  categories.  On  the  contrary,  the  gender  appear to influence  the 
pembrolizumab  safety,  with  a  higher  rate  of  female  compared  to  male  patients  who  discontinued 
pembrolizumab due to AEs (14.5% vs 5.4%), drug-related AEs (12.9% vs 3.3%), SAEs (14.5% vs 4.3%) 
and drug-related SAEs (12.9% vs 2.2%). Despite an higher incidence of discontinuations of pembrolizumab 
due to AEs observed in female patients compared to male patients in KEYNOTE-024 (14.5% vs 5.4%), the 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 72/83 
 
overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both genders. Based on a review of the narratives for 
female subjects discontinued due to AEs, not all reported discontinuations are definitely lead by AE, lowering 
the rate of "true" discontinuations due to AEs to a level (8%) similar to that observed in the reference safety 
data set, where there was no difference between gender (11.9% in males and 12% in females). Moreover, 
difference  of  incidence  between  the  genders  might  be  exaggerated  due  to the  small  patient numbers  in 
KN-024. This view is supported by analyses of the much larger reference safety dataset, where meaningful 
differences in the safety profile between female and male subjects cannot be demonstrated. In addition, no 
imbalances were observed in the second-line NSCLC study (KEYNOTE-010). Therefore, the higher rate of 
discontinuations due to AEs in female subjects in KN-024 is most likely a chance finding due to imprecise 
data collection/entry and small patient numbers. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the submitted data, no new pembrolizumab safety concerns arise. Overall, the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab compares favourably with SOC chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.0 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and/or CHMP.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.2 with the following content. Data from study P024 
have been included in different sections of the RMP: 
Safety concerns 
No new safety concerns have been identified. The list of safety concerns as approved in the previous version 
of the RMP is considered still valid for the extension of indication.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable because of the limited impact of this 
variation on the Keytruda PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication application is for the treatment of adult patients with stage IV NSCLC patients 
previously  untreated  for  their  metastatic  disease.  The  sought  indication  is  for  patients  with  tumour 
expressing PD-L1 (TPS≥50%), measured in tumour tissue by IHC using the Dako Commercial Ready Assay 
(CRA), and not harbouring EGFR activating mutations and ALK translocations. 
The  aim  of  therapy  in  this  setting  is  to  prolong  progression  free-survival  and  overall  survival,  with  no 
addition of major treatment-related toxicity.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  prognosis  of  advanced  NSCLC  is  poor  and  more  than  80%  of  patients  experience  multiple  severe 
cancer-related symptoms.  
Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (four to a maximum of six cycles) is still the standard of care for the 
first  line treatment  of  NSCLC  not  harbouring  EGFR  activating  mutations  and ALK  translocations,  with  no 
major  differences  in  efficacy  across  combinations.  The  strategy  of  maintenance  treatment,  either  as 
maintained use of an agent included in first-line treatment (“continuation maintenance”) or as introduction 
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 79/83 
 
 
of a new agent after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (“switch maintenance”) has been explored 
and an improvement has been reported with pemetrexed (both continuation and switch maintenance, only 
in non-squamous histology) and erlotinib (switch maintenance in patients with stable disease after first-line 
chemotherapy). 
Available  systemic  therapy,  except  that  for  tumors  not  harbouring  EGFR  sensitizing  mutations  or  ALK 
rearrangements,  can  only  determine  a  limited  improvement  in  survival  up  to  8–12  months,  with  an 
enhanced symptom control and a better quality of life in 60%–70% despite treatment toxicity (Leighl NB. et 
al, 2012).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pembrolizumab efficacy and safety data in the first line NSCLC setting are based  on one single, well 
designed,  phase  III,  randomized,  pivotal  study  (KEYNOTE-024)  conducted  in  PD-L1  strongly  positive 
(TPS≥50%) NSCLC patients, comparing pembrolizumab to a SOC platinum-based doublet that was selected 
by the investigator at the time of randomization among 5 different options (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus 
carboplatin  AUC  5  to  6  mg/mL/min  or  cisplatin  75  mg/m2 day  1,  for  4  to  6  cycles  followed  by  optional 
maintenance pemetrexed, in non-squamous histologies only; gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus 
carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, for 4 to 6 cycles; paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 plus 
carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min day 1, for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by optional maintenance pemetrexed 
only in non-squamous histologies). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Median  PFS  (primary  endpoint)  was  10.3  months  with  pembrolizumab  vs  6.0  months  with  SOC 
chemotherapy (HR: 0.50, p<0.001), with 6-month and 12-month PFS rates of 62.1% vs 50.3% and 47% vs 
15%, respectively. 
The HR for OS (secondary endpoint) was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.41-0.89; one-sided logrank p-value =0.005) with 
12-month OS rate of 69.9% vs 54.2% in pembrolizumab and SOC chemotherapy arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There  are  no  additional  remaining  uncertainties  and  limitations  that  have  an  impact  on  the  benefit/risk 
balance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Despite the comparable number of patients experiencing AEs across arms (96.1% with pembrolizumab and 
96.7% with SOC), a lower rate of drug-related AEs (73.4% vs 90%), drug-related Grade ≥3 AEs (26.6% vs 
53.3%),  and  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  drug-related  AEs  (7.1%  vs  10.7%)  occurred  with 
pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy.  
In the pembrolizumab arm, the most commonly reported drug-related AEs were Diarrhoea (14.3%), Fatigue 
(10.4%) and Pyrexia (10.4%).  
A lower rate of drug-related Grade≥3 AEs was reported with pembrolizumab compared to the chemotherapy 
arm (26.6% vs 53.3%). The drug-related Grade≥3 AEs occurred more commonly in patients treatment with 
pembrolizumab were Diarrhea (3.9% vs 1.3%) and Pneumonitis (2.6% vs 0.7%). 
As  expected,  a  higher  incidence  of  AEOSI,  including  immune-mediated  AEs,  was  registered  in  the 
pembrolizumab arm compared to chemotherapy (29.2% vs 4.7%), and the most frequently reported events 
were Hypothyroidism (9.1% vs 1.3%), Hyperthyroidism (7.8% vs 1%), Pneumonitis (5.8% vs 0.7%) and  
Assessment report  
EMA/16441/2017 
Page 80/83 
 
Infusion reactions (4.5% vs 1.3%). Events were mostly mild, and Grade ≥3 AEOSI was reported in 9.7% of 
patients treated with pembrolizumab. 
In line with previously submitted data of pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients, the most common drug-related 
SAE was Pneumonitis (4.5%).  
3.5.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There  are  no  additional  remaining  uncertainties  or  limitations  that  have  an  impact  on  the  benefit/risk 
balance.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically significant improvement was reported with pembrolizumab compared to SOC, with a PFS gain of 
4.3 months and 40% decreased risk of death. The advantage in OS was observed despite the not negligible 
rate of patients (44%) who crossed over to pembrolizumab, thus further emphasizing the contribution of 
pembrolizumab as first line treatment.  
A  lower  rate  of  drug-related  AEs,  drug-related  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  treatment  discontinuation  due  to 
drug-related AEs was observed in patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to SOC chemotherapy. 
The pembrolizumab safety profile is quite consistent with that of other PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. No new 
pembrolizumab safety concern emerged.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
This is the first trial showing a clinically relevant advantage in PFS and OS compared to the recognized SOC 
chemotherapy  in  first  line  NSCLC  patients.  The  pembrolizumab  safety  profile  was  consistent  with  that 
previously reported and overall positively compares with toxicity related to SOC chemotherapy in terms of 
frequency and severity.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Not applicable. 
Conclusions  
The  overall  B/R  of  Keytruda  for  the  treatment  of  PD-L1  strongly  positive  (TPS≥50%)  NSCLC  patients  is 
positive.

Extension of Indication to include first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in 
adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK 
positive tumour mutations; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. An updated RMP version 4.2 was agreed during the 
procedure. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

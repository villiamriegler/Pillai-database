4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Bemrist Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 
12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled 
short-acting beta2-agonists. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over 
The recommended dose is one capsule to be inhaled once daily. 
Patients should be given the strength containing the appropriate mometasone furoate dosage for the 
severity of their disease and should be regularly reassessed by a healthcare professional. 
The maximum recommended dose is 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily. 
Treatment should be administered at the same time of the day each day. It can be administered 
irrespective of the time of the day. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. Patients 
should be instructed not to take more than one dose in a day. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are 
available for the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore it 
should be used in these patients only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The posology in patients 12 years of age and older is the same posology as in adults. The safety and 
efficacy in paediatric patients below 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For inhalation use only. The capsules must not be swallowed. 
The capsules must be administered only using the inhaler provided (see section 6.6) with each new 
prescription. 
Patients should be instructed on how to administer the medicinal product correctly. Patients who do 
not experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicinal 
product rather than inhaling it. 
The capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing (see sections 4.4 and 
6.6). 
For instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Deterioration of disease 
This medicinal product should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, including acute episodes 
of bronchospasm, for which a short-acting bronchodilator is required. Increasing use of short-acting 
bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed 
by a physician. 
Patients should not stop treatment without physician supervision since symptoms may recur after 
discontinuation. 
It is recommended that treatment with this medicinal product should not be stopped abruptly. If 
patients find the treatment ineffective, they should continue treatment but must seek medical attention. 
Increasing use of reliever bronchodilators indicates a worsening of the underlying condition and 
warrants a reassessment of the therapy. Sudden and progressive deterioration in the symptoms of 
asthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical assessment. 
Hypersensitivity 
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been observed after administration of this medicinal 
product. If signs suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular angioedema (including difficulties in 
breathing or swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips and face), urticaria or skin rash, treatment should 
be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
As with other inhalation therapy, administration of this medicinal product may result in paradoxical 
bronchospasm, which can be life-threatening. If this occurs, treatment should be discontinued 
immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 
Cardiovascular effects of beta agonists 
Like other medicinal products containing beta2-adrenergic agonists, this medicinal product may 
produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by increases in 
pulse rate, blood pressure and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, treatment may need to be 
discontinued. 
This medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders 
(coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension), convulsive 
disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Patients with unstable ischaemic heart disease, a history of myocardial infarction in last 12 months, 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV left ventricular failure, arrhythmia, uncontrolled 
hypertension, cerebrovascular disease or history of long QT syndrome and patients being treated with 
medicinal products known to prolong QTc were excluded from studies in the indacaterol/mometasone 
furoate clinical development programme. Thus safety outcomes in these populations are considered 
unknown. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While beta2-adrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, 
such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of QT interval and ST segment depression, the clinical 
significance of these observations is unknown. 
Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) or LABA-containing combination products such as 
Bemrist Breezhaler should therefore be used with caution in patients with known or suspected 
prolongation of the QT interval or who are being treated with medicinal products affecting the QT 
interval. 
Hypokalaemia with beta agonists 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the 
potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually 
transient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe asthma hypokalaemia may be 
potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment, which may increase the susceptibility to cardiac 
arrhythmias (see section 4.5). 
Clinically relevant hypokalaemia has not been observed in clinical studies of indacaterol/mometasone 
furoate at the recommended therapeutic dose. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids may produce increases in 
plasma glucose. Upon initiation of treatment, plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in 
diabetic patients. 
This medicinal product has not been investigated in patients with Type I diabetes mellitus or 
uncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus. 
Prevention of oropharyngeal infections 
In order to reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candida infection, patients should be advised to rinse their 
mouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush their teeth after inhaling the prescribed 
dose. 
Systemic effects of corticosteroids 
Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for 
prolonged periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids and may 
vary in individual patients and between different corticosteroid preparations. 
Possible systemic effects may include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, 
growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataracts, glaucoma, 
and, more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, 
sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is therefore important 
that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma 
is maintained. 
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical (including intranasal, inhaled and 
intraocular) corticosteroid use. Patients presenting with symptoms such as blurred vision or other 
visual disturbances should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible 
causes of visual disturbances, which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central 
serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical 
corticosteroids.

This medicinal product should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or 
in patients with chronic or untreated infections. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No specific interaction studies were conducted with indacaterol/mometasone furoate. Information on 
the potential for interactions is based on the potential for each of the monotherapy components. 
Medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval 
Like other medicinal products containing a beta2-adrenergic agonist, this medicinal product should be 
administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants or medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the 
QT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase 
the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Hypokalaemic treatment 
Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids or 
non-potassium-sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic 
agonists (see section 4.4). 
Beta-adrenergic blockers 
Beta-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. Therefore, 
this medicinal product should not be given together with beta-adrenergic blockers unless there are 
compelling reasons for their use. Where required, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers should be 
preferred, although they should be administered with caution. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has no impact on the safety of therapeutic doses of 
Bemrist Breezhaler. 
Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance (CYP3A4 and P-gp) or mometasone furoate 
clearance (CYP3A4) raises the systemic exposure of indacaterol or mometasone furoate up to 
two-fold. 
Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant 
interactions with mometasone furoate are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased 
systemic exposure to mometasone furoate when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co-administered. 
Other long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists 
The co-administration of this medicinal product with other medicinal products containing long-acting 
beta2-adrenergic agonists has not been studied and is not recommended as it may potentiate adverse 
reactions (see sections 4.8 and 4.9).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are insufficient data from the use of Bemrist Breezhaler or its individual components 
(indacaterol and mometasone furoate) in pregnant women to determine whether there is a risk. 
Indacaterol was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits following subcutaneous administration (see 
section 5.3). In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits, mometasone furoate 
caused increased foetal malformations and decreased foetal survival and growth. 
Like other medicinal products containing beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may inhibit labour due 
to a relaxant effect on uterine smooth muscle. 
This medicinal product should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no information available on the presence of indacaterol or mometasone furoate in human 
milk, on the effects on a breast-fed infant, or on the effects on milk production. Other inhaled 
corticosteroids similar to mometasone furoate are transferred into human milk. Indacaterol (including 
its metabolites) and mometasone furoate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy, 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Reproduction studies and other data in animals did not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either 
males or females. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
This medicinal product has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions over 52 weeks were asthma (exacerbation) (26.9%), 
nasopharyngitis (12.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.9%) and headache (5.8%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 1). The frequency of 
the ADRs is based on the PALLADIUM study. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug 
reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention 
(CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); 
rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected 
overdose. 
An overdose will likely produce signs, symptoms or adverse effects associated with the 
pharmacological actions of the individual components (e.g. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, 
hyperglycaemia, suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function). 
Use of cardioselective beta blockers may be considered for treating beta2-adrenergic effects, but only 
under the supervision of a physician and with extreme caution, since the use of beta2-adrenergic 
blockers may provoke bronchospasm. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalised.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
corticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AK14 
Mechanism of action 
This medicinal product is a combination of indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist 
(LABA), and mometasone furoate, an inhaled synthetic corticosteroid (ICS). 
Indacaterol 
The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part 
attributable to increased cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels, which cause 
relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. 
When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a partial agonist 
at the human beta2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, 
indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action. 
Although beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth 
muscle and beta1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the human heart, there are also 
beta2-adrenergic receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total adrenergic 
receptors. 
Mometasone furoate 
Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for glucocorticoid receptors and 
local anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro, mometasone furoate inhibits the release of leukotrienes 
from leukocytes of allergic patients. In cell culture, mometasone furoate demonstrated high potency in 
inhibition of synthesis and release of IL-1, IL-5, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. It is also a potent inhibitor of 
leukotriene production and of the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 from human CD4+ 
T-cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic response profile of this medicinal product is characterised by rapid onset of 
action within 5 minutes after dosing and sustained effect over the 24-hour dosing interval, as 
evidenced by improvements in trough forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) 
improvements versus comparators 24 hours after dosing. 
No tachyphylaxis to the lung function benefits of this medicinal product was observed over time. 
QTc interval 
The effect of this medicinal product on the QTc interval has not been evaluated in a thorough QT 
(TQT) study. For mometasone furoate, no QTc-prolonging properties are known. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Two phase III randomised, double-blind studies (PALLADIUM and QUARTZ) of different durations 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of Bemrist Breezhaler in adult and adolescent patients with persistent 
asthma. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PALLADIUM study was a 52-week pivotal study evaluating Bemrist Breezhaler 
125 mcg/127.5 mcg once daily (N=439) and 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily (N=445) compared to 
mometasone furoate 400 mcg once daily (N=444) and 800 mcg per day (given as 400 mcg twice daily) 
(N=442), respectively. A third active control arm included subjects treated with salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily (N=446). All subjects were required to have symptomatic 
asthma (ACQ-7 score ≥1.5) and were on asthma maintenance therapy using an inhaled synthetic 
corticosteroid (ICS) with or without LABA for at least 3 months prior to study entry. At screening, 
31% of patients had history of exacerbation in the previous year. At study entry, the most common 
asthma medications reported were medium dose of ICS (20%), high dose of ICS (7%) or low dose of 
ICS in combination with a LABA (69%). 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of either Bemrist Breezhaler 
125 mcg/127.5 mcg once daily over mometasone furoate 400 mcg once daily or Bemrist Breezhaler 
125 mcg/260 mcg once daily over mometasone furoate 400 mcg twice daily in terms of trough FEV1 
at week 26. 
At week 26, Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/127.5 mcg and 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily both 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 and Asthma Control Questionnaire 
(ACQ-7) score compared to mometasone furoate 400 mcg once or twice daily, respectively (see 
Table 2). Findings at week 52 were consistent with week 26. 
Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/127.5 mcg and 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily both demonstrated a 
clinically meaningful reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (secondary 
endpoint), compared to mometasone furoate 400 mcg once and twice daily (see Table 2). 
Results for the most clinically relevant endpoints are described in Table 2.

Pre-specified pooled analysis 
Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily was also studied as an active comparator in another 
phase III study (IRIDIUM) in which all subjects had a history of asthma exacerbation requiring 
systemic corticosteroids in the past year. A pre-specified pooled analysis across the IRIDIUM and 
PALLADIUM studies was conducted to compare Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily to 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily for the endpoints of trough FEV1 and ACQ-7 at 
week 26 and annualised rate of exacerbations. The pooled analysis demonstrated that Bemrist 
Breezhaler improved trough FEV1 by 43 ml (95% CI: 17, 69) and ACQ-7 score by -0.091 (95% 
CI: -0.153, -0.030) at week 26 and reduced the annualised rate of moderate or severe asthma 
exacerbations by 22% (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) and of severe exacerbations by 26% (RR: 0.74; 
95% CI: 0.61, 0.91) versus salmeterol/fluticasone.

The QUARTZ study was a 12-week study evaluating Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/62.5 mcg once 
daily (N=398) compared to mometasone furoate 200 mcg once daily (N=404). All subjects were 
required to be symptomatic and on asthma maintenance therapy using a low-dose ICS (with or without 
LABA) for at least 1 month prior to study entry. At study entry, the most common asthma medications 
reported were low-dose ICS (43%) and LABA/low-dose ICS (56%). The primary endpoint of the 
study was to demonstrate superiority of Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/62.5 mcg once daily over 
mometasone furoate 200 mcg once daily in terms of trough FEV1 at week 12. 
Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/62.5 mcg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
in baseline trough FEV1 at week 12 and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score compared to 
mometasone furoate 200 mcg once daily. 
Results for the most clinically relevant endpoints are described in Table 3.

Paediatric population 
In the PALLADIUM study, which included 106 adolescents (12-17 years old), the improvements in 
trough FEV1 at week 26 were 0.173 litres (95% CI: -0.021, 0.368) for Bemrist Breezhaler 
125 mcg/260 mcg once daily vs mometasone furoate 800 mcg (i.e. high doses) and 0.397 litres (95% 
CI: 0.195, 0.599) for Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/127.5 mcg once daily vs mometasone furoate 
400 mcg once daily (i.e. medium doses). 
In the QUARTZ study, which included 63 adolescents (12-17 years old), the Least Square means 
treatment difference for trough FEV1 at day 85 (week 12) was 0.251 litres (95% CI: 0.130, 0.371). 
For the adolescent subgroups, improvements in lung function, symptoms and exacerbation reductions 
were consistent with the overall population. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
indacaterol/mometasone furoate in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following inhalation of Bemrist Breezhaler, the median time to reach peak plasma concentrations of 
indacaterol and mometasone furoate was approximately 15 minutes and 1 hour, respectively. 
Based on the in vitro performance data, the dose of each of the monotherapy components delivered to 
the lung is expected to be similar for the indacaterol/mometasone furoate combination and the 
monotherapy products. Steady-state plasma exposure to indacaterol and mometasone furoate after 
inhalation of the combination was similar to the systemic exposure after inhalation of indacaterol 
maleate or mometasone furoate as monotherapy products. 
Following inhalation of the combination, the absolute bioavailability was estimated to be about 45% 
for indacaterol and less than 10% for mometasone furoate. 
Indacaterol 
Indacaterol concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration. Steady state was 
achieved within 12 to 14 days. The mean accumulation ratio of indacaterol, i.e. AUC over the 24-h 
dosing interval on day 14 compared to day 1, was in the range of 2.9 to 3.8 for once-daily inhaled 
doses between 60 and 480 mcg (delivered dose). Systemic exposure results from a composite of 
pulmonary and gastrointestinal absorption; about 75% of systemic exposure was from pulmonary 
absorption and about 25% from gastrointestinal absorption. 
Mometasone furoate 
Mometasone furoate concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration via the 
Breezhaler inhaler. Steady state was achieved after 12 days. The mean accumulation ratio of 
mometasone furoate, i.e. AUC over the 24-h dosing interval on day 14 compared to day 1, was in the 
range of 1.61 to 1.71 for once-daily inhaled doses between 62.5 and 260 mcg as part of the 
indacaterol/mometasone furoate combination. 
Following oral administration of mometasone furoate, the absolute oral systemic bioavailability of 
mometasone furoate was estimated to be very low (<2%). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Indacaterol 
After intravenous infusion the volume of distribution (Vz) of indacaterol was 2 361 to 2 557 litres, 
indicating an extensive distribution. The in vitro human serum and plasma protein binding were 94.1 
to 95.3% and 95.1 to 96.2%, respectively. 
Mometasone furoate 
After intravenous bolus administration, the Vd is 332 litres. The in vitro protein binding for 
mometasone furoate is high, 98% to 99% in concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/ml. 
Biotransformation 
Indacaterol 
After oral administration of radiolabelled indacaterol in a human ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion) study, unchanged indacaterol was the main component in serum, accounting 
for about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24 hours. A hydroxylated derivative was the most 
prominent metabolite in serum. Phenolic O-glucuronides of indacaterol and hydroxylated indacaterol 
were further prominent metabolites. A diastereomer of the hydroxylated derivative, an N-glucuronide 
of indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated products were further metabolites identified. 
In vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 was the only UGT isoform that metabolised indacaterol 
to the phenolic O-glucuronide. The oxidative metabolites were found in incubations with recombinant 
CYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is concluded to be the predominant isoenzyme responsible 
for hydroxylation of indacaterol. In vitro investigations further indicated that indacaterol is a 
low-affinity substrate for the efflux pump P-gp. 
In vitro the UGT1A1 isoform is a major contributor to the metabolic clearance of indacaterol. 
However, as shown in a clinical study in populations with different UGT1A1 genotypes, systemic 
exposure to indacaterol is not significantly affected by the UGT1A1 genotype. 
Mometasone furoate 
The portion of an inhaled mometasone furoate dose that is swallowed and absorbed in the 
gastrointestinal tract undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. There are no major 
metabolites detectable in plasma. In human liver microsomes mometasone furoate is metabolised by 
CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
Indacaterol 
In clinical studies which included urine collection, the amount of indacaterol excreted unchanged via 
urine was generally lower than 2% of the dose. Renal clearance of indacaterol was, on average, 
between 0.46 and 1.20 litres/hour. Compared with the serum clearance of indacaterol of 18.8 to 
23.3 litres/hour, it is evident that renal clearance plays a minor role (about 2 to 6% of systemic 
clearance) in the elimination of systemically available indacaterol. 
In a human ADME study in which indacaterol was given orally, the faecal route of excretion was 
dominant over the urinary route. Indacaterol was excreted into human faeces primarily as unchanged 
parent substance (54% of the dose) and, to a lesser extent, hydroxylated indacaterol metabolites (23% 
of the dose). Mass balance was complete with ≥90% of the dose recovered in the excreta. 
Indacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life 
ranging from 45.5 to 126 hours. The effective half-life, calculated from the accumulation of 
indacaterol after repeated dosing, ranged from 40 to 52 hours which is consistent with the observed 
time to steady state of approximately 12 to 14 days. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mometasone furoate 
After intravenous bolus administration, mometasone furoate has a terminal elimination T½ of 
approximately 4.5 hours. A radiolabelled, orally inhaled dose is excreted mainly in the faeces (74%) 
and to a lesser extent in the urine (8%). 
Interactions 
Concomitant administration of orally inhaled indacaterol and mometasone furoate under steady-state 
conditions did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either active substance. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Systemic exposure of mometasone furoate increased in a dose proportional manner following single 
and multiple doses of Bemrist Breezhaler 125 mcg/62.5 mcg and 125 mcg/260 mcg in healthy 
subjects. A less than proportional increase in steady-state systemic exposure was noted in patients with 
asthma over the dose range of 125 mcg/62.5 mcg to 125 mcg/260 mcg. Dose proportionality 
assessments were not performed for indacaterol as only one dose was used across all dose strengths. 
Paediatric population 
Bemrist Breezhaler may be used in adolescent patients (12 years of age and older) at the same 
posology as in adults. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with asthma after inhalation of 
indacaterol/mometasone furoate indicated no significant effect of age, gender, body weight, smoking 
status, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and FEV1 at baseline on the systemic 
exposure to indacaterol and mometasone furoate. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Due to the very low contribution of the urinary pathway to total body elimination of indacaterol and 
mometasone furoate, the effects of renal impairment on their systemic exposure have not been 
investigated (see section 4.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
The effect of indacaterol/mometasone furoate has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic 
impairment. However, studies have been conducted with the monotherapy components (see 
section 4.2). 
Indacaterol 
Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no relevant changes in Cmax or AUC of 
indacaterol, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects and 
their healthy controls. No data are available for subjects with severe hepatic impairment. 
Mometasone furoate 
A study evaluating the administration of a single inhaled dose of 400 mcg mometasone furoate by dry 
powder inhaler to subjects with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment 
resulted in only 1 or 2 subjects in each group having detectable peak plasma concentrations of 
mometasone furoate (ranging from 50 to 105 pcg/ml). The observed peak plasma concentrations 
appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment; however, the numbers of detectable levels 
(assay lower limit of quantification was 50 pcg/ml) were few. 
Other special populations 
There were no major differences in total systemic exposure (AUC) for both compounds between 
Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data are available for other ethnicities 
or races.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The non-clinical assessments of each monotherapy and of the combination product are presented 
below. 
Indacaterol and mometasone furoate combination 
The findings during the 13-week inhalation toxicity studies were predominantly attributable to the 
mometasone furoate component and were typical pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids. 
Increased heart rates associated with indacaterol were apparent in dogs after administration of 
indacaterol/mometasone furoate or indacaterol alone. 
Indacaterol 
Effects on the cardiovascular system attributable to the beta2-agonistic properties of indacaterol 
included tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial lesions in dogs. Mild irritation of the nasal cavity 
and larynx was seen in rodents. 
Genotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential. 
Carcinogenicity was assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. 
Increased incidences of benign ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of ovarian smooth muscle in 
rats were consistent with similar findings reported for other beta2-adrenergic agonists. No evidence of 
carcinogenicity was seen in mice. 
All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of those anticipated in humans. 
Following subcutaneous administration in a rabbit study, adverse effects of indacaterol with respect to 
pregnancy and embryonal/foetal development could only be demonstrated at doses more than 500-fold 
those achieved following daily inhalation of 150 mcg in humans (based on AUC0-24 h). 
Although indacaterol did not affect general reproductive performance in a rat fertility study, a decrease 
in the number of pregnant F1 offspring was observed in the peri- and post-natal developmental rat 
study at an exposure 14-fold higher than in humans treated with indacaterol. Indacaterol was not 
embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or rabbits. 
Mometasone furoate 
All observed effects are typical of the glucocorticoid class of compounds and are related to 
exaggerated pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids. Mometasone furoate showed no genotoxic 
activity in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. 
In carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, inhaled mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically 
significant increase in the incidence of tumours. 
Like other glucocorticoids, mometasone furoate is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits. Effects noted 
were umbilical hernia in rats, cleft palate in mice and gallbladder agenesis, umbilical hernia and flexed 
front paws in rabbits. There were also reductions in maternal body weight gains, effects on foetal 
growth (lower foetal body weight and/or delayed ossification) in rats, rabbits and mice, and reduced 
offspring survival in mice. In studies of reproductive function, subcutaneous mometasone furoate at 
15 mcg/kg prolonged gestation and difficult labour occurred, with a reduction in offspring survival 
and body weight. 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that mometasone may pose a risk to surface water 
(see section 6.6).

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3d. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3d. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once.

Instructions for use of Bemrist Breezhaler inhaler 
1.  What Bemrist Breezhaler is and what it is used for 
What Bemrist Breezhaler is and how it works 
Bemrist Breezhaler contains two active substances called indacaterol and mometasone furoate. 
Indacaterol belongs to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. It relaxes the muscles of the small 
airways in the lungs. This helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the 
lungs. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small airways to remain open. 
Mometasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids (or steroids). 
Corticosteroids reduce the swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the small airways in the lungs and 
so gradually ease breathing problems. Corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma. 
What Bemrist Breezhaler is used for 
Bemrist Breezhaler is used regularly as treatment for asthma in adults and adolescents (12 years of age 
and older). 
Asthma is a serious, long-term lung disease where the muscles surrounding the smaller airways 
become tight (bronchoconstriction) and inflamed. Symptoms come and go and include shortness of 
breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. 
You should use Bemrist Breezhaler every day and not only when you have breathing problems or 
other symptoms of asthma. This will ensure that it controls your asthma properly. Do not use this 
medicine to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. 
If you have any questions about how Bemrist Breezhaler works or why this medicine has been 
prescribed for you, ask your doctor. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Bemrist Breezhaler 
Follow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. 
Do not use Bemrist Breezhaler 
- 
if you are allergic to indacaterol, mometasone furoate or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice.

Frequently Asked 
Questions 
Why didn’t the inhaler 
make a noise when I 
inhaled? 
The capsule may be stuck 
in the capsule chamber. If 
this happens, carefully 
loosen the capsule by 
tapping the base of the 
inhaler. Inhale the 
medicine again by 
repeating steps 3a to 3d. 
What should I do if there 
is powder left inside the 
capsule? 
You have not received 
enough of your medicine. 
Close the inhaler and 
repeat steps 3a to 3d. 
I coughed after inhaling 
– does this matter? 
This may happen. As long 
as the capsule is empty 
you have received enough 
of your medicine. 
I felt small pieces of the 
capsule on my tongue – 
does this matter? 
This can happen. It is not 
harmful. The chances of 
the capsule breaking into 
small pieces will be 
increased if the capsule is 
pierced more than once. 
Cleaning the inhaler 
Wipe the mouthpiece 
inside and outside with 
a clean, dry, lint-free 
cloth to remove any 
powder residue. Keep 
the inhaler dry. Never 
wash your inhaler with 
water. 
Disposing of the 
inhaler after use 
Each inhaler should be 
disposed of after all 
capsules have been 
used. Ask your 
pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines 
and inhalers that are no 
longer required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fentanyl  citrate  is  a  potent  opioid  analgesic  (ATC  N02AB).  Fentanyl,  a  pure  o
pioid  agonist,  acts 
primarily through interaction with µ receptors located in the brain, spinal cord, and
 smooth muscle to 
produce  its  pharmacologic  effect.  Its  analgesic  potency  is  approximately  80  times
  that  of  morphine. 
The  primary  site  of  therapeutic  action  is  the  cen
tral  nervous  system  (CNS).  Fentanyl  is  a  widely 
approved  medicinal  active  substance  with  well  known  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological  properties,  available  since  1960s  in  different  formulations,  includ
ing  subcutaneous, 
intravenous, transdermal and transmucosal dosage forms. 
PecFent  is  indicated  for  the  management  of  breakthrough  pain  (BTP),  recurrent
transitory  pain,  in  patients  who  are  already  receiving  maintenance  opioid  therapy

The  purpose  of  Archimedes’  nasal  fentanyl  product  PecFent  is  to  deliver  fentan
yl  as  a  controlled 
quantity into the nasal cavity and thereby to achieve rapid systemic absorption as w
ell as fast onset of 
action.  Fentanyl  is  assumed  to  be  suitable  for  nasal  administration  due  to  its  low  mo
lecular  weight, 
high  pote
ncy  and  lipid  solubility.  Through  nasal  administration,  gastrointestinal  and  hepatic 
presystemic  elimination  is  bypassed  which  is  expected  to  enable  high  absolute  bioavailability  of  the 
drug substance.  
The  PecFent  formulation  incorporates  PecSys,  a  proprietary  pectin-based  gelling  agent  which  aims  to 
optimise  the profile  of  fentanyl  by  modulating  absorption;  allowing  short  time  to  Tmax  but  controlled 
Cmax.  It  comprises  fentanyl  in  the  form  of  the  citrate  salt,  pectin,  tonicity  adjusting  agent  and 
preservatives. The solution has a low viscosity and can be delivered using a conventional nasal spray 
pump.  When  the  spray  droplets  are  deposited  into  the  nose,  the  pectin  interacts  with  calcium  ions 
present in the nasal mucosal secretions to form soft, mildly adherent gel droplets on the surface of the 
nasal mucosa.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
PecFent  is  an  aqueous  solution  containing  the  drug  substance,  fentanyl  citrate,  wh
intranasal use, and which uses a proprietary drug delivery system, based on the g
LM  pectin,  which  modulates  the  in-vivo  absorption.  It  is  regarded  as  a  novel  d

is  a  well  known  and  characterized  potent  opioid  analgesic  with  a
morphine. The active substance has been first marketed in the early 1960s and me
in different pha
ich  is  intended  for 
elling properties of 
osage  form  in  the 
al mucosa. Fentanyl 
  potency  about  100  times  that  of 
anwhile is available 
rmaceutical forms (including transdermal, parenteral and transmucosal formulations).   
The nasal route of absorption avoids first-pass metabolism of the active substance.  
The nasal spray is available in strengths of 1.0 mg/ml and 4.0 mg/ml (corresponding to fentanyl) as a 
multi dose product.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
The  chemical  name  of  fentanyl  citrate  is  N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)  piperidin-4-yl]propanamide 
dihydrogen 
2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 
corresponding 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
C22H28N2O· C6H8O7 and Relative molecular mass 528.6 (salt) or 336.48 (base). F
entanyl citrate is a 
well-known drug substance monographed in European Pharmacopoeia. It appears a
s a white or almost 
white pow
der, soluble in water, freely soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in alcohol. 
Manufacture 
An ASMF has been submitted for the active substance. Fentanyl is manufactured 
by  several chemical 
and  purification  steps  all  sufficiently  described.  The  materials  and  reagents  use
d  were  adequately 
characterised. 
Specif
ication 
The quality of the drug substance, fentanyl citrate, complies with the specification
s and requirements 
described in the monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). Additional
 in-house testings to 
the Ph. Eur. monograph are: residue on ignition, heavy metals, fentanyl assay and a number of other
impurities by an additional HPLC method and particle
 sizes for the milled active substance. 
Batch analysis data were provided for three batches. All batches met the Ph. Eur. sp
ecification. 
Stability 
Stability data for seven batches, all packaged in two different type of containers, stored at 25°C/60% 
RH up to 60 months and for two batches stored at 40°C/7
5% RH up to 6 months were presented. 
All parameters tested during the stability studies remained within specifications over the period tested. 
No real tendency in regard to the active substance’s degradation can be concluded from the generated 
data, neither under long term nor accelerated storage conditions.  
Overall, the data submitted support the proposed re-test period when stored in the original packages.   
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  development  was  to  produce  a  preserved  nasal  spray  formulation  fo
r  the  indication  of 
breakthrough pain, ensuring rapid onset of action by initial rapid absorption of fen
tanyl, followed by a 
modulated release across the nasal m
ucosa due to the gelling concept of the formulation. Based on the 
pharmacokinetic and tolerability data from the Phase I study, the pectin formulation was selected for 
further  development.  All  subsequent  clinical  studies  used  formulations  (1.0  mg/
ml  and  4.0  mg/ml 
fentanyl) identical to those currently proposed. 
Considering  fentanyl  citrate’s  solubility  it  is  obvious  that  the  active  substance’s  particle  size  is  no 
critical  parameter  regarding  the  in-vivo  performance,  since  fentanyl  citrate  is  comp
letely  dissolved  in 
the nasal solution. Possible interactions between active substance and excipients ar
e not expected and 
have not been observed based on the results of the stability studies 
LM  pectin  is  included  as  a  gelling  agent  to  provide  modulated  delivery  of  fentanyl.  When  the  spray 
droplets of drug product are deposited in the nose, the LM pectin interacts with calc
ium ions present in 
the nasal mucosal fluid to form a gel. The fentanyl then diffuses from the pectin g
el and is absorbed. 
This  e
ffect  has  been  demonstrated  in  vitro  using  a  diffusion  cell  model.  In  vivo,  the  gel  formulation 
modulates the systemic uptake of the fentanyl by maintaining the Tmax whilst redu
cing the Cmax.  
Studies  demonstrated  the  fentanyl  release/diffusion  properties  are  expected  to  re
main  consistent  for 
different  batches  of  drug  product  through  product  shelf  life  irrespective  of  cha
nges  in  pectin  gel 
strength. 
A  blend  of  LM  pectin  with  sucrose  used  in  PecFent is  considered  a  novel  excipient 
because  it  has  not 
previously  been  used  in  appr
oved  pharmaceutical  products  intended  for  the  nasal  route  of 
administration. The specification for LM pectin is based on the compendial specification for pectin and 
additionally includes functional tests relevant to the performance of the material in
 PecFent. Additional 
tests include pectin content, sucrose content, degree of esterification, gel strength a
nd viscosity. 
Pectin  and  sucrose  are  both  commonly  used  excipients  in  pharmaceutical  a
nd  food  products.   
The  specification,  information  on  the  analytical  test  methods  and  validation  of  t
he  analytical  test 
methods for LM pec
tin are fully described. 
The LM pectin and sucrose blend physicochemical properties and the optimal conce
ntration have been 
determined  to  provide  a  solution  with 
the  desirable  physicochemical  characteristics  which  gels  on 
contact  with  a  physiological  concentration  of  calcium  and  forms  a  well  dispersed  spray  plume 
appropriate for nasal delivery when delivered via a metered-dose nasal spray. The effect of excipients 
and on physicochemical and spray properties were studied. Based on the available data, the diffusion 
of  fentanyl  from  PecFent  seems  to  be  highly  consistent  when  prepared  using  a  range  of  batches  of 
pectin  and  sucrose  blend  if  they  are  in  accordance  with  the  quality  requirements  as  laid  down  in  the 
respective specification.  
The  safety  data  generated  during  both  the  Phase  I/II  and  pivotal  Phase  III  clinical  studies  have 
demonstrated excellent local tolerability of PecFent.

PecFent  is  preserved  with  phenylethyl  alcohol  and  propyl  parahydroxybenzoate  (propylparaben).  
The preservatives have been selected at concentrations reported to be individually
 efficacious but are 
used in combination to provide an appropriate spectrum of action against bacteria, y
easts and moulds. 
Preservative effectiveness testing (PET), according to P
h. Eur. 5.1.3, has been conducted as part of the 
development programme and during stability testing to confirm the efficacy of the chosen combination 
and support the proposed preservative limits at the end of shelf life.  
The  manufacturing  process  comprises  preparation  of  a  pH-adjusted  bulk  solution,  whi
ch  is  then  filled 
into bottles and capped with the appropriate nasal spray pump. 
The process has been developed and 
scaled-up  to  the  current  batch  size  with  little  change.  An  automated  filling  and  capping  line  will  be 
utilized for the commercial manufacture. In order to minimize residual liquid in the
 spray bottle at the 
end of patient use, the fill weight will be reduced from 1.73 grams to 1.57 grams. 
The development of the 
manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. Additional retrospective 
process validation data was presented for the pilot scale batches. Critical process parameters and steps 
were  defined  as  well  as  other  manufacturing  process  related  key  parameters.  Analyti
cal  data  relating 
to a range of batch sizes using different processing conditions and at two different 
manufacturing sites 
were prov
ided in the report.      
A  pre-approval inspection,  in  order  to verify  the compliance  to EU  GMP  and  relate
d  guidelines  and  to 
the  marketing  application  for  the  manufacture  of  PecFent  nasal  spray  has 
taken  place.  The 
manufacturing  site  can  be  considered  acceptable  for  the  manufacture  of  PecFent
  and  in  compliance 
with EU GMP. 
PecFent  is  presented  in  a  5.3  ml  capacity,  Ph.  Eur.  Type  I  glass  bottle  sealed  w
ith  a  locking  screw 
closure, metered-dose nasal spray pu
mp containing an integrated visual and audible spray-counter and 
mechanical end-of-use lock. The bottle has a U-shaped internal chamber to minimise fill volume. Each 
actuation is designed to deliver 100 μl of solution containing 100 μg or 400 μg fenta
nyl. When primed, 
the pump will deliver eight sprays before it locks. 
The assembled unit will be placed in a child-resistant outer container. The chosen co
ntainer will comply 
with the international standard “ISO 8317:2003, Child-resistant packaging - Requir
ements and testing 
procedures for reclosable packages”. 
Testing  has  been  carried  out  to  establish  the  likelihood  of  leaching  of  substanc
es  from  the  plastic 
components  of  the  pump.  From  the  results,  the  only  one  leachable  o
bserved  at  a  meaningful  level;  
the  limit  of  which  is  controlled  in  the  shelf  life  specification.  Other  leachables  are
  at  or  below 
quantitation limits.  
Appropriate  studies  assess  the  effec
t  of  dosing  orientation  on  priming  and  performance  of  the  spray 
pump in different orientations, defined the maximum non-use period and the appropriateness of the fill 
volume.  It  was  also  demonstrated  that  wiping  the  actuator  nozzle  tip  between  actuations  during 
routine analysis had an insignificant effect on delivered dose weight. 
Results from an in-use study indicate that FNS dose delivery is consistent over the proposed in-use life 
of the product, with non-use periods up to the recommended maximum non-use period. 
The  robustness  of  PecFent  drug  product  units  in  terms  of  general  product  integrity  and  spray 
performance (delivered dose and droplet size distribution) is studied in a drop test. The results indicate 
that  the  product  maintains  satisfactory  performance  when  dropped  and  should  perform  satisfactorily 
after events that may arise during normal use.

batches used in the stability studies is identical to the formulation proposed for mar
keting.  
Results of parameters investigated in the stability program, are within the shelf life
 specifications and 
show that PecFent is stable. Stability data, supported by preservative efficacy testing, indicate that the 
two  preservatives  remain  at  efficacious  levels  up  to  24  months,  when  drug  product  is  stored  at  long 
term conditions. No significant changes were observed for all parameters investigated during 6 months 
testing at accelerated storage conditions (40°C/75%RH). 
Additional 
in-use, 
temperature  cycling  and  photostability  studies  have  been  performed.  
The  information  is  detailed  and  comprehensible.  The  temperature  cycling  study  showed  that  PecFent 
should remain in specification following exposure to temperature excursions outside the recommended 
storage  conditions.  The  proposed  fentanyl  citrate  solution  demonstrated  better  photostability  than  an 
equivalent  aqueous  solution.  The  spray  solution  should  be  considered  stable  to  light.  However,  as  a

precautionary  measure  and  to  be  in  line  with  the  recommendations  for  the  active  substance,  the 
product should be protected from light.  
Overall  the  results  indicate  a  good  chemical  and  physical  stability  of  the  nasal  spray  stored  under 
standard ICH conditions and therefore the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions are 
accepted. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant

ceutical  and 
The  quality  of  PecFent  nasal  spray  is  adequately  established.  Information
  on  development, 
manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfa

quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by 
data. 
Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development
,  manufacture  and 
control  of  the  drug 
product  and  novel  excipient  has  been  presented.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out 
indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these 
in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
the clinic. Stability tests in
dicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable 
for the proposed shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Fentanyl  is  a  potent  opioid  that  acts  primarily  through  interaction  with  the  µ recep
tors  located  in  the 
CNS and smooth muscles to produce its analgesic 
effect. Fentanyl has been widely marketed since the 
early  1960s  in  a  variety  of  different  formulations.  The  intranasal  spray  formulation  of  fentanyl  citrate 
(Fentanyl Nasal Spray = FNS) was developed to provide rapid relief from recurrent episodes of acute 
transitory  pain,  termed  breakthrough  pain  (BTP)  in  patients,  who  are  already  receiving  maintenance 
opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. 
The  pivotal  repeat  dose  toxicology  studies  in  rats  (3  and  6  months,  Study  nos.  WFEN/P34/05  and 
WFEN/P37/05)  and  dogs  (9  months,  Study  no.  WFEN/P36/05)  and  the  accompanying  toxicokinetic 
investigations were performed in compliance to GLP standards.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  fentanyl  has  been well  characterised  and  is  also
  documented  in  the 
scientific  literature,  so  no  additional  animal  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  submitted.  This 
application relies on published preclinical data to describe primary, secondary and s
afety pharmacology 
of fentanyl (i.e. preclinical studies conducted for the reference products, Effentora a
nd Actiq, data cited 
from the FDA Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) for Actiq (NDA 20-747) and from th
e public domain). 
Fentanyl is a selective µ-opioid receptor agonist showing selectivity over δ- and κ- 
opioid receptors of 
around  200-fold  depending  on  the  receptor  system  studied.  It  acts  primarily throu
gh  interaction  with 
µ-opioid  receptors  located  in  the  brain,  spinal  cord  and  smooth  muscle.  Fentany
l  is  around  80-fold 
more potent than morphine with a significant shorter duration of action. Fentanyl bi
nding in the central 
nervous  system  (CNS)  occurs  at  the  following  sites  in  decreasing  order  of  stren
gth:  midbrain  and 
striatum,  hypothalamus,  cerebral  cortex,  hippocampus,  brainstem,  spinal  cord
,  and  cerebellum. 
Fentanyl  interacts  to  a  lesser  extent  with  central  and  peripheral  (
e.g.  vascular)  α-adrenergic  and 
muscarinic  (M3 subtype)  receptors.  More  recently,  it  has  been  postulated  that  P-glycoprotein  ATPase 
activity may in part be involved in the a
nti-nociceptive effect of fentanyl and other opiates which are 
substrates  for  P-glycoprotein,  such  as  m
orphine  (Hamabe  et al.  2006).  Another  study  demonstrated 
that  opioid  side  effects  are  most  easily  elicited  at  anti-nociceptive  doses  for  oxycodone,  followed  by 
buprenorphine,  hydrocodone,  morphine,  and  codeine,  with  fentanyl  having  the  l
owest  overall  ratio 
between ED50 for side effects and for analgesic potency (Meert and Vermeirsch, 200
5).

ation  compared  to 
safety  pharmacological  effects  of  fentanyl  following  intranasal  application  administr
conventional routes of administration are expected. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  overall  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  fentanyl  have  been  widely  analysed  in  t
he  literature.  Apart 
from  the  prominent  first-pass  effect  following  oral  administration,  which  can 
be  effectively 
circumvented  by  the  intranasal  route,  it  is  not  expected  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  FNS  will 
significantly differ from that of other routes. For this reason, the CHMP considered a
cceptable that the 
application  focuses  on  absorption  aspects  and  refers  to  publicly  available  informatio
n  regarding  all 
other pharmacokinetic data. 
Already  known  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products/drugs  as  MAO-inhibitors,  other  opioids, 
anaesthetics,  hypnotics,  sedatives,  antidepressants,  neuroleptics,  alcohol  or  inhibitors  or  inducers  of 
CYP 3A4 are appropriately included in SmPC and PL. 
Fentanyl  crosses  the  placenta  in  animals  and  humans,  and  it  is  excreted  into  human  breast  milk. 
Therefore, women should only breast-feed while taking fentanyl after a careful benefit-risk evaluation, 
because of the possibility of sedation and/or respiratory depression in their infants. SmPC and PL have 
been labelled accordingly. 
In  order  to  develop  a  suitable  intranasal  formulation  for  FNS,  the  applicant  performed  three 
pharmacokinetic  studies  (non-GLP)  in  sheep  to  evaluate  the  absorption  of  different  fentanyl

It can be concluded from these studies that fentanyl is absorbed when administered
in sheep. However, the number of animals was low, variability high, and the finding
s were inconclusive 
with  respect  to  the  effect  of  pectin  concentration  on  absorption.  Furthermore,  the  test  species  was 
different from species used in toxicology studies. These data were considered as sup
portive by CHMP. 
The pectin excipient is a well known constituent in foods and medicinal products w

Local Tolerance 
Local  tolerance  was  analysed  as  part  of  the  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies.  Both  in  the  three  months 
toxicity study in rats and the nine months chronic toxicity study in dogs, no signs of local intolerability 
were apparent. In contrast, a higher incidence of minimal to slight goblet cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia 
in the most anterior and the next following segment of the nasal cavity was found in female rats of the 
high dose group in the six months toxicity study in rats. No such changes were evident at the end of 
the recovery period. Hypertrophy/hyperplasia of this cell type is considered to be a reversible regular 
physiological  adaptive  response  to  exposure  to  a  mild  irritant.  In  addition,  there  is  evidence  that  the 
rat  may  be  generally  more  susceptible  to  toxic  effects  on  nasal  cavity  than  non-rodents  due  to  their 
thinner  nasal  mucosa.  Although  in  clinical  trials  with  FNS  nasal  mucosa  related  side  effects  such  as 
sneezing,  nasopharyngitis  and  rhinitis  were  observed,  the  overall  nasal  tolerability  was  adequately 
demonstrated  in  humans.  Altogether,  the  risk  that  patients  who  are  using  FNS  will  suffer  from 
irreversible nasal toxicity is considered to be highly unlikely.

Breakthrough  cancer  pain  is  characterised  by  rapid  onset  (median  interval  from  o
nset  to  peak  pain 
intensity is three minutes, range one second to thirty minutes), moderate to severe
 in intensity, and of 
relatively  short  duration  (mean  30  minutes).  Because  of  these  characteristics,  an 
ideal  treatment  for 
breakthrough  cancer  pain  would  have  a  rapid  onset  and  relatively  short  duration 
of  analgesic  effect.  
It is acknowledged that several advantages may be realized from delivering fentan
yl intranasally: (1) 
avoidance of hepatic first-pass elimination, gut wall metabolism, and/or destru
ction in gastrointestinal 
fluids;  (2)  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  and
  the  plasma  level-time  profile  can  be  made  quite 
comparable to that obtained  by i.v. medication; and (3)  the rich vasculature and numerous microvilli 
structure in the nasal cavity offer a feasible and des
irable site for absorption of systemically effective 
drugs (Chien & Chang 1987. Intranasal drug delivery for systemic medications, Critical Reviews in  
Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, Vol. 4, Issue 2, p. 67-194).

Study CP037/02 
A  randomised,  single  centre,  four-way  complete  crossover  trial  to  assess  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
safety of three novel nasal formulations of fentanyl, including, fentanyl-pectin (Sol
ution B), compared 
to the oral transmucosal (lozenge) formulation 
This  study  was  performed  to  select  a  nasal  fentanyl  formulation  that  would  maint
ain  the  early  Tmax 
obtained  with  nasal  administration  of  fentanyl  whilst  modulating  Cmax,  to  achieve  a
  fast  onset  of 
action  without  additional  side  effects  compared  to  existing  routes  of  administration  of  fentanyl.  
The  primary  efficacy  measures  were  the  Cmax,  Tmax,  and  AUC  of  plasma  fentanyl  following 
administration of each formulation. The secondary efficacy measure was the bioavailability of the nasal 
formulations relative to the oral lozenge, Frel. Safety and tolerability were assessed by a reactogenicity 
(local  nasal  tolerability)  questionnaire,  completed  after  each  nasal  dose,  and  by  monitoring  other 
adverse events throughout the study. 
During the study, 18 healthy male and female subjects (aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 50 years) each received 100 
µg  fentanyl  (1.0  mg/ml  fentanyl  base,  in  the  form  of  the  citrate  salt)  in  the  three  different  nasal 
formulations  and  200  µg  fentanyl  as  the  lozenge  formulation,  on  four  separate  dosing  periods 
(following a randomised Latin square design). Naltrexone was administered to the subjects before and 
during  each  dosing  period  to  block  the  pharmacological  effects  of  the  fentanyl.  Blood  samples  were

period of, at least, three days between each dose.  
Plasma  concentrations  of  fentanyl  following  single  dose  administration  of  different

Fentanyl (100 µg) appeared to be absorbed more rapidly and with greater relative bioavailability when 
administered nasally compared to Actiq, the oral transmucosal lozenge treatment (200 
µg).  
Each  of  the  three  different  FCNS-formulations  displayed  rapid  increase  of  plasma 
Tmax  ranging  from  approx.  10  min  to  approx.  19  min.  As  expected,  Tmax  of  the

The  data  presented  above  were  not  dose  normalised  for  the  Actiq  200  µg  dose.  As  compared  to  the 
100  µg  doses  of  the  fentanyl  formulations,  Actiq  displayed  lower  Cmax  values.  This  finding  is 
explainable by the fact that only a portion of the OTFC dose is absorbed transmucosally. The remaining 
portion  is  swallowed  and  is  either  later  absorbed  or  presystemically  eliminated  by  first-pass 
metabolism.  The  first  pass  effect  observed  after  oral  administration  also  explains  the  less  than 
proportional increase in AUC for the 200 µg Actiq dose as compared to the 100 µg FCNS dose. 
Standardised  methods  were  employed  for  assessing  product  safety  in  the  Phase  I  studies.  
Local  tolerability  was  assessed  by  the  subjects  using  a  specifically  designed  reactogenicity 
questionnaire and completing an overall assessment of the convenience of nasal dosing at the end of 
each  nasal  treatment.  A  clinical  safety  assessment  by  an  ear,  nose  and  throat  (ENT)  specialist  was

Despite its long t½, fentanyl is known to exhibit a short duration of action that is consistent with rapid 
and  extensive  uptake  of  fentanyl  in  highly  perfused  tissues  (brain,  heart,  and  lungs)  (Mather  and

NS doses were administered in an escalating dose order and the OTFC dose was administered at 
any point in the FCNS sequence, according to a randomisation code. There were at least three days of 
washout between dose periods. For doses of 200 µg and 800 µg two sprays of 
100 µg respectively two 
sprays of 400 µg (one i
n each nostril) were administered.  
An overall of 17 blood samples (5 ml) for fentanyl analysis were taken up to 48 hou
rs post-dose. 
As known from study CP037/02, Tmax is expected to occur after about 19 minutes. Five blood samples 
were taken within the first 30 min post-administration, which is believed to adequately cover the time 
of  maximum  plasma  concentration.  Terminal  elimination  of  fentanyl  is  known  to  take  long  due  to 
redistribution from peripheral tissues. Hence, the overall sampling period of 48 hours was considered 
adequate. 
17 subjects were enrolled, of which 12 (8 males, 4 females) completed the study successfully and 
comprised the PK population.  
Although the test products were administered under naltrexone block, high doses (up to 800 µg) were 
applied  to  healthy volunteers  in  study CP042/05.  Accordingly, it  does  not  surprise  that  five  out  of  17 
enrolled subjects dropped out. 4 subjects were withdrawn from the study (1 due to AEs [vomiting after

length of time a patient should wait before taking 
a second dose of PecFent for pain relief. Eight doses 
of 100 μg of PecFent were administered to the same nostril to determine what happens if the contents 
of one device (8 x 100 μl) is taken at once. The PK data obtained following a single dose of 100 μg of 
PecFent were used as reference. 
The proposed PecFent labelling specifies that PecFent is to be used for treatment of BTP episodes with 
an interval of at least 4 hours in-between. The design of study CP047/07 (two sprays of FCNS 1, 2 and 
4  hours  apart)  is  suitable  to  provide  data  on  possible  dose  accumulation  and  thus  to  justify  the 
proposed dosing recommendation. 
The  intranasal  fentanyl  doses  were  administered  in  an  ascending  total  dose  manner  as  a  safety 
precaution. Each treatment was administered under a naltrexone block to prevent the development of 
the unwanted effects of opiate administration in naïve subjects.

whether  the  deviation  from  dose-proportionality  seen  following  the  eight-dose  regi

limited  capacity  of  the  nasal  cavity,  or  whether  it  reflects  an  overwhelming  of  the  gel

Therefore, the about 5-fold increase in bioavailability (instead of 8-fold) is not rega

safety  feature  as  compared  to  other  BTP  medications.  In  any  way,  there  are  n

requirements to demonstrate the safety of a medicinal product after intentional overdose.

Due  to  the  lack  of  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  PecFent  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  and 
adolescents. 
Differences  in  the  PK  profile  as  a  function  of  age  have  been  reported  in  the  literature.  In  individuals 
aged  >60  years  the  apparent  elimination  half-life  of  nasal  administered  fentanyl  may  be  significantly 
longer. In a study by Bentley et al (1982) higher serum concentrations of fentanyl in elderly patients 
than  in  younger  adult  patients  (<  50  years)  were  seen,  despite  equivalent  dosing.  The  prolonged 
fentanyl elimination in elderly patients results mainly from reduced drug clearance. In a postoperative 
study  of  five  younger  (age  30-65  years)  and  6  elderly  (age  78-88  years)  the  elimination  half-life  of 
fentanyl  was  23  hours  longer  in  the  elderly  compared  to  the  younger  patients  (Esteve  et  al.  1991). 
These  data  suggest  that  a  given  dose  of  fentanyl  will  last  longer  in  elderly  patients  than  in  younger

the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, has been shown to reduce the clearance of intravenous fentanyl by 
two-thirds. The interaction between ritonavir and fentanyl was investigated in 11 healthy volunteers in 
a  randomized  crossover  study  (Olkkola  et  al  1999).  Subjects  received  oral  ritonavir  or  placebo  for  3

 Since, rapid rise in plasma levels (best characterized

 across the entire dose range of 100 to 800 µg it is shown at the same

The study was conducted using unit dose presentations delivering 25, 100 or 400 µg fentanyl per spray, 
allowing doses of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 µg to be administered by using one or two sprays per 
dose. This study produced first efficacy and tolerability data, which were used as the basis for choosing 
the 100 and 400 µg strengths as most suitable for further development. The 100 and 400 µg strengths

pain (BTCP) in subjects taking regular opioid therapy.  
crossover  study  of 
reakthrough cancer 
Patients (>18 years) who were taking at least 60 mg oral morphine or equivalent for at least 1 week 
for cancer-related pain as regular, 24-hour medication for their underlying persiste
nt cancer pain were 
eligible to enrol into an initial open-label, dose-titration phase.  
Eligible patients were experiencing, on average, but not necessarily every day, 1 to 4 episodes of BTCP 
(Breakthrough  Cancer  Pain)  per  day  that  were  adequately  controlled  with  a  stable  dose  of  standard 
rescue medication, typically a fast-acting opioid, of which the patient was to have an adequate supply 
throughout the study. Breakthrough pain was defined as a transitory flare of moderate to severe pain 
(on  a  4-point  scale  from  0  to  3  [none,  mild,  moderate,  severe])  that  occurred  on  a  background  of 
persistent pain controlled to moderate intensity or less by the opioid regimen. If the patient had more 
than  1  type  of  breakthrough  pain,  or  had  breakthrough  pain  in  more  than  1  location,  only  1  of  the 
pains was identified as a “target” breakthrough pain. 
Patients who successfully completed the dose-titration phase were then to continue into a double-blind 
treatment phase, where up to 10 episodes of breakthrough pain were treated with the study drug.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the SPID at 30 minutes. The mean SPID 30 post dose was greater 
and statistically significant for PecFent treated episodes (6.57) compared with placebo treated episodes 
(4.45), p<0.0001. 
A summary of SPID at 30 minutes for the mITT Population is presented in the table below.

In their answer, the applicant argued that SPID30min has been the preferred prim
ary end point term 
for  cross-over  placebo-controlled  studies  with  the  EU  approved  oral  mucosa  form
ulations  (Actiq  and 
Effentora) (Farrar 1
998; Portenoy 2006; Slatkin 2007; Effentora EPAR: EMA H/C/833)). The benefit of 
the SPID30min term is that it provides a cumulative summation of pain difference over a time period 
rather than at a specific time point. In addition to the need to demonstrate speed 
of onset, there is a 
need  to  demonstrate  that  pain  relief  persists  appropri
ately,  without  the  frequent  need  for  further 
dosing or additional medication. The CHMP, considering the results obtained with the
 secondary criteria 
(PID  at  different  times,  percentage  of  responders,  need  for  rescue  medication)  co
ncluded  that  these 
supported a statistical and clinical difference in favour of PecFent versus pl
acebo.  
The mean PI score for PecFent treated episodes was statistically different from that of pl
acebo treated 
episodes at the 5 minute time point (p=0.0298) and decreased over the subsequent time points (10 to 
60 minutes) (p≤0.0014). 
The mean PID was statistically significantly greater for PecFent  treated episodes than for the placebo 
treated episodes at each time point from 10 to 60 minutes post dose. 
Similar  results  were  observed  for  PR  and  TOTPAR.  The  overall  mean  patient-averaged  acceptability 
assessment  score  was  significantly  greater  for  PecFent  as  compared  with  placebo  at  30  minutes 
postdose (2.63 vs. 2.01, p<0.0001) and at 60 minutes postdose (2.73 vs. 2.02, p<0.0001).

Rescue  medication:  rescue  medication  was  evaluated  by  patients  and  by  episodes.  The  results  are 
presented below. 
Rescue medication usage (mITT population) 
Episode rescue medication usage up to 4 hours (mITT population) 
Even if rescue medication was not allowed before 30 minutes, more patients with P
ecFent used rescue 
medication  during  the  first  30  minutes  than  placebo  patients.  When  evaluating  re
scue  medication  by 
episodes, no difference was found during the first 30 minutes between PecFent and placebo. This could 
be  explained  by  the  fact  that  more  episodes  were  treated  with  PecFent  than  with  placebo  for  each 
patient (7 compared to 3). After 30 minutes, the use of rescue medication is statistically significantly 
higher for patients with placebo than with PecFent. 
Efficacy conclusion
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  this  study  was  the  SPID  from  5  to  30  minutes  post-dose.  BTCP 
episodes  treated  with  PecFent  showed  a  mean  SPID  score  that  was  significantly  higher  than  that  for 
episodes treated with placebo (6.57 vs. 4.45, respectively, p<0.0001).  
The  mean  PI  score  was  significantly  lower  following  PecFent  treatment  than  following  placebo

nasal spray established during the open, dose-titration phase. Fentanyl nasal spray
 was to be used to 
treat  a  maximum  of  4  episodes  of  BTCP  per  day.  At  least  four  hours  between  e

For the first 4 weeks, telephone visits were scheduled weekly to review safety and adjust dose levels, if 
needed. Clinic visits were to subsequently occur at weeks 4, 8, and 12 to assess safety and tolerance, 
to  review  e-diary  data,  and  to  collect old  medication  and  dispense  new  study  medication.  Extra  clinic 
visits occurred where necessary to dispense additional study drug, according to the patient’s needs.

patient  was  defined  as  taking  rescue  medication,  if  he/she  took  rescue  medicat
ion  for  any  episode 
treated. Where p
atients had taken rescue medication within 60 minutes of study drug administration, 
an  additional  sensitivity  analysis was performed  on  the  data  at  60  minutes,  excluding  those  episodes 
where r
escue medication had been taken at any time point during the assessment period. 
Sample size 
The applicant stated that a sufficient number of subjects would be enrolled to ensur

Results  
Participant flow 
In the initially submitted interim report, a total of 132 patients were included in the ITT Population; 73 
(55.3%) were newly enrolled and 59 (44.7%) were rolled over from study CP043/06/FCNS. No patient 
was  included  from  study  CP044/06/FCNS  because  very  limited  amounts  of  data  were  available  from 
this  study.  Furthermore,  as  this  study  had  yet  to  be  un-blinded,  no  causality  assessment  of  AEs  was 
possible, so the data were not included in the interim analysis.  
In the final report, 351 patients were screened for the entry into the study, of which 64 patients failed 
screening.  Subsequently,  287  patients  entered  the  Open,  Dose-Titration  Phase.  Of  these,  51  patients 
withdrew (including 6 patients who did not take any doses of Nasalfent). A total of 236 patients of the

had titrated appropriately and identified effective yet well-tolerated doses.  
During  the  initial  dose  escalation  period  of  study  CP043/06  patients  were  titrated  to  their  individual 
successful dose. The successful dose was reached when the patient achieved adequate pain relief over 
two  consecutive  episodes  with  the  same  dose  and  without  experiencing  undue  adverse  events.  The 
protocol  of  the  titration  procedure  was  straightforward  and  delivered  unambiguous  information  on 
adequacy of the chosen dose. Patients did not have the option of a “second puff” of PecFent. Pain relief 
was subjectively assessed by the patient after 30 min. In case of insufficient pain relief the patient was 
free to use his usual rescue medication and the patient used a higher dose for the next episode. A dose 
range of 100 to 800 µg per single dose was tested in phase III. In study CP043/06, 72.85% of patients 
were able to find their successful dose during titration (6.1% withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, 5.3%

was tested in cancer patients ranging from 25 to 800 µg fentanyl. The overall num

 dose. These doses

Patient exposure 
Safety  information  has  been  collected  from  eight  studies,  four  Phase  I  studies  and  four  Phase  II/III 
studies.  Of  these,  three  Phase  III  studies  (CP043/06,  CP044/06  and  CP45/06)  have  been  performed 
with the multi-dose device that is proposed for marketing: CP043 and an interim report for CP045/06 
were submitted with the original MAA; CP044 and the final report for CP045 were submitted with the 
response to the list of questions (LOQ) at Day 120 and considerably increased the size of the Phase III 
database (506 patients were included in the integrated Phase II/III safety population compared to 209 
submitted with the original application) 
All  patients  treated  with  fentanyl  nasal  spray  in  the  Phase  III  studies  were  administered  one  of  the 
following  doses:  100mc  g,  200mcg,  400mcg,  or  800mcg  fentanyl.  The  fentanyl-pectin  nasal  spray 
formulation utilising the PecSys nasal drug delivery system to modulate the delivery and absorption of 
fentanyl has been used throughout the Phase I and Phase II/III studies.

CP045/06, but there was a higher proportion of Caucasians (87%) in Study CP041/04 than in the other 
studies.  Mean  weight  was  very  similar  across  the  three  studies  (78.8  kg  in  CP043/06,  72.0  kg  in 
CP045/06 with a range of 39-150 kg). 
Disease stage in patients included in Study CP043/06 and CP045/06 was standardised as a diagnosed 
solid tumour or haematological tumour requiring regular, 24-hour medication (60 mg oral morphine or 
equivalent  opioid)  for  underlying  persistent  cancer  pain  and  typically  having  one  to  four  episodes  of

Adverse events  
Nasal clinical examination and local tolerability 
As  already  discussed  in  the  efficacy  section,  PecFent  did  not  appear  to  cause  any  local  tolerability 
problems. Information on epistaxis has been adequately treated in the SmPC. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) 
As  already  mentioned,  it  is  possible  that  a  proportion  of  the  TEAEs  ascribed  to  fentanyl  nasal  spray 
may in fact be due, at least in part, to the patients’ regular background opioid med
ication. In addition 
the background rate of AEs is particularly high in this patient population.  
The  expected  treatment-related  AE  profile  of  a  strong  opioid  was  observed 
with  dizziness  and 
gastrointestinal  disorders  ranking  first.  The  CHMP  thought  it  remarkable  that  no
t  a  single  case  of 
respiratory depression was reported in the initially submitted data, and requested cl
arifications. 
With  the  answers  at  day  121,  the  availability  of  data  on  a  substantial  number  of 
additional  patients, 
and over longer periods of time, has increased the
 number of treatment-emergent  adverse events of 
dyspnoea to 27, occurring in 23 patients. Only two of these were assessed by the investigator as being 
possibly (1) or probably (1) related to study medication (PecFent). The CHMP endorsed this conclusion. 
Of the 523 subjects in the safety population, 7 subjects from CP041 did not receive 1 of the 4 doses of 
FNS that comprise the basis of this summary of safety. Thus, for displays that present  data by dose, 
516 subjects comprise the safety population. 
During the Phase I studies, 62.0% of the subjects experienced one or more adverse events that were 
assessed  by  the  investigator  as  treatment-related.    The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related 
adverse  events  were  rhinitis,  headache,  rhinorrhoea,  and  nausea.  The  majority  of  treatment-related 
adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe adverse events included one event each of 
vomiting, rhinitis, balance disorder, headache, and rhinorrhoea.

and therefore the percentages add up to more than 100%. 
No  investigator  reported  any  specific  concerns  over  abuse  or  diversion  for  any  of  the  pa
tients  within 
trial  CP043/06  –  however,  the  possibility  cannot  be  completely  excluded  for  the  small  number  of 
patients with large unexplained discrepancies. However, it is more likely in this population that any use 
of  doses  outside  the  protocol  was  for  extra  episodes  of  breakthrough  pain  that  were  not  recorded  in 
the e-diary. 
For  study  CP045/06  the  median  discrepancy  for  the  Titration  phase  was  +0  sprays  (lower  and  upper 
quartiles +0 and +1, minimum and maximum -6 and +7). The median discrepancy for the Open Label

One  patient  was  withdrawn  from  the  trial  for  the  adverse  event  of  intentional  drug  misuse  (patient

Overall, the CH
MP concluded that for PecFent the long known issue of abuse/overuse of strong opioids 
is reasonably addressed by the inherent safety devices of the multiple dose container (audible click for 
each successful actuation, drug counting system, lock-out after eight administratio
ns) within the legal 
framework of Controlled Drug prescription regulations. 
Device malfunction
Device malfunctions (overall causes) was 16.9% of the num
ber of patients in trial CP043/06 and 8.9% 
in  trial  CP045/06.  This  showed  that  malfunction  is  nearly  halved  when  the  studies  progress  from 
titration  to  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  The  reported  malfunctions  are  th
us  likely  to  reflect 
patient inexperience in the use of the device, such as not recognising spray deliver

device  malfunction.  The  overall  technical  reliability  of  the  dosage  form  ap

disease  in  this  patient  collective  (brain  neoplasm,  colon  cancer  metastatic,  pancreatic  carcinoma, 
breast  cancer  etc.).  Overall,  the  frequency  of  severe  or  serious  probably  treatme
nt-related  adverse 
events does not seem to
 be unduly increased by the rapid rise in fentanyl plasma level achieved after 
nasal application. In all cases of treatment-related serious TEAEs (constipation, intestinal perforation, 
non-cardiac chest pain, peritonitis) a great deal of overlap with either maintenance opioid medication 
or the underlying cancer disease is assumed. Not a single case of serious, probably treatment-related 
respiratory depression was observed. 
Deaths
In  total,  88  deaths  were  reported  in  all  studies.  Five  of  these  (all  occurring  in  Study  CP45/06)  were

The  influence  of  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  medicinal  product  has 
not  been  evaluated,  however,  when  administered  intravenously  the  clearance  of  fentanyl  has  been 
shown  to  be  altered  in  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  due  to  alterations  in  metabolic  clearance  and 
plasma proteins. After administration of fentanyl nasal spray, impaired hepatic and renal function may 
both  increase  the  bioavailability  of  fentanyl  and  decrease  its  systemic  clearance,  which  could  lead  to 
increased and prolonged opioid effects. 
Therefore, special care should be taken during the titration process in patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic or renal impairment. (SmPC Effentora, 2008).

contacts between themselves and site staff, i.e. at each study visit, during planned telephone contacts 
(occurring during the titration phase of each study) and upon any informal / unplanned contacts during 
other  phases.  All  reported  events  were  recorded  on  the  appropriate  CRF  page  for  that  study. 
Increasing  time  spans  elapsed  between  patient-study  staff  contacts,  reflective  of  the  risk  involved  at 
the particular study phase: daily contacts during first exposure (titration). Thereafter, spans extended 
to  contacts  at  least  once  a  week  during  the  treatment  periods  once  the  individually  effective  and 
tolerable  dose  has  been  established.  The  rationale  behind  this  approach  was  that  entry  of  AEs  by 
means of the electronic recording device would have added considerably to the complexity / burden of 
the e-diary system and would have been hardly feasible in this frail study population.  
The  reported  portion  of  75.4%  of  patients  reporting  at  least  one  AE  is  in  the  expected  order  of 
magnitude in this patient population and does not point to systematic AE under-reporting.

According to literature re
ports (Christrup et al. 2008), the Tmax value of an ordinary aqueous solution 
of fentanyl was about 11 min after intranasal administration. In the PecFent dose pro
portionality study 
CP042/05 Tmax values ranged from approx. 15 to 19 min over the entire 100-800
mcg dose range. It 
is therefore noted that inclusion of pectin does not fundamentally alter the time t
o maximum plasma 
concentration. When considering the clinical implication of different Tmax values, it
 is to be taken into 
consideration  that  the  analgesic  effect  occurs  at  lower  than  m

earlier  than  formal  attainment  of  Tmax.  This  is  reflected  by  early  pain  assessment  time  points  for

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  risk  profile  of  nasally  applied  fentanyl  in  elderly,  hepatic  or  renal  impairment  is  considered  to 
correspond  to  the  risk  profile  of  intravenously  applied  fentanyl.  The  respective  warning  notes  and 
dosing recommendations in the proposed SmPC are in line with those approved for Effentora. However, 
the CHMP decided that the PSUR cycle will be independent from the one of the reference products, to 
allow identification of any issues related to the new formulation and novel mode of administration.

Risk Balance 
Benefits 
•  Beneficial effects 
There  is  a  recognised  clinical  need  for  analgesics  with  rapid  onset  of  action  in  cancer  patients  with 
breakthrough  pain.  Due  to  its  pharmacokinetic  profile  the  fentanyl-containing  PecFent  nasal  spray  is 
suitable to meet this clinical need. Efficacy of PecFent in the proposed dose ranging from 100 to  800 
mcg per administration has been shown in adequately designed, placebo- and active- controlled phase 
III studies.  
Efficacy  of  the  PecFent  formulation  was  mainly  demonstrated  by  the  phase  II  dose-finding,  proof-of-
principle  study  CP041/04,  the  pivotal  phase  III  trial  CP043/06  and  the  supportive  phase  III  trial

•  Unfavourable effects 
The  ad

effects and dizziness, somnolence, headache. Nasal effects (epistaxis, rhinorrhoea) and information on 
the concomitant use of nasal decongestants are adeq
uately addressed in the SmPC. 
The  potential  for  overdose  and  abuse  is  known  and  has  been  adequately  cove

literature.

An aspect of product safety arising from inclusion of pectin, is the possible implication of intravenous 
misuse of the intranasal solution. The gel is formed when the solution interacts with calcium ions. On 
the one side, pectin inclusion may be regarded as an additional deterrent against intravenous misuse. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC alerts against intravenous misuse of the PecFent solution. 
Risk Management Plan
Several  issues  regarding  the  RMP  need  to  be  addressed  as  follow-up  measures.  In  particular  the 
applicant is requested to provide educational material as additional risk minimisation activities.

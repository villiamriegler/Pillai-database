2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2011 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
familial amyloid polyneuropathy (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting approximately less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the 
application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the progressive neuropathy inducing muscular 
weakness and in later stages impaired mobility, gastrointestinal problems, orthostatic hypotension, 
and bladder dysfunction.  
The condition is fatal, with a life expectancy of 9-13 years from symptom onset. The main life 
threatening events are related mainly to the deposition of amyloid in the cardiac tissue, inducing 
myocardial infarction and fatal arrhythmias; 
• 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
2.2.  Amendment of an existing orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the amendment of the orphan medicinal product designation 
in 2017 was based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the amended condition with the medicinal product containing synthetic 
double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against transthyretin mRNA was considered 
justified based on preliminary clinical data showing sustained reduction of transthyretin serum 
levels over 24 months of treatment and stabilization of parameters of neurologic and cardiac 
damage; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of neuropathy 
and cardiomyopathy. Life expectancy is 3 to 15 years from symptom onset, depending on the 
transthyretin mutation; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing synthetic double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against transthyretin 
mRNA will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided 
preliminary clinical data showing an effect of the proposed product on the cardiac manifestations of 
the condition, which are not targeted by the currently authorized treatment. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the 
condition.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, systemic disease occurring in 
adults, resulting from either hereditary (genetic mutation) or acquired (ageing) causes.  
The hereditary forms are commonly sub-classified into two syndromes: hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy, also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), and hATTR amyloidosis with 
cardiomyopathy, also known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC). They are caused by 
autosomal dominant mutations in the gene coding for transthyretin (TTR, also known as prealbumin),  
a 127 amino acid protein produced predominantly by hepatocytes, with a minimum fraction produced 
by the choroid plexus and retina. Mutations in the TTR protein lead to destabilization of the tetrameric 
form and to dissociation into dimers and monomers; misfolding of mutated monomers from the α-
helical to the β-pleated sheet structure results in tissue deposition of oligomers and amyloid fibrils.   
The site of amyloid deposition and the particular TTR mutation determine the clinical manifestations of 
the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy. There are over 100 reported TTR genetic mutations, resulting in a continuum of 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy or hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy phenotypes. 
The granted therapeutic indication “Onpattro is indicated for the treatment of adults with hereditary 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 
polyneuropathy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of transthyretin-
mediated amyloidosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified (reference is 
made to the European public assessment report of Onpattro). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no significant changes in the serious and chronically debilitating nature of the 
condition since the time of initial orphan designation.  
hATTR amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal multi-symptom disease that may present with peripheral 
(sensory and motor) neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy. The age of symptoms 
onset ranges between the second and ninth decades of life, with great variability across different 
populations. hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy characteristically begins with sensory neuropathy 
involving legs and arms and then progresses to disabling motor neuropathy characterized by leg 
weakness and inability to walk, and autonomic neuropathy causing severe gastrointestinal pathology, 
orthostatic hypotension, and bladder dysfunction with recurring urinary tract infections. Cardiac 
involvement is common in late stage hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy patients due to amyloid 
infiltration of the sinus node and atrioventricular conduction system, and infiltration of the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/564536/2018 
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
myocardium. Involvement of the conduction system can lead to sudden death due to heart block or 
tachyarrhythmias, and myocardial infiltration can lead to diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. 
Life expectancy is usually to 3 to 15 years from symptom onset, depending on the TTR mutation and 
clinical picture. Patients with cardiac involvement usually have a shorter life expectancy, while the 
prognosis is more variable in patients with polyneuropathy.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor provided a comprehensive update of the prevalence of the condition, taking into account 
different definitions of the condition of the past (with separation of the forms characterised by 
polyneuropathy from those with cardiomyopathy). There have been no significant changes in the 
prevalence of the condition between the time of the amendment of the designation (2017) and today.  
The sponsor conducted a literature search to retrieve published articles providing epidemiologic data 
on the prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis; hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, hATTR amyloidosis 
with cardiomyopathy, and wtATTR amyloidosis in the European Union, and consulted additional 
sources, including patients’ organizations, research consortia, and registries. From a critical appraisal 
of the literature and the other sources, the sponsor derived the current prevalence estimates for each 
of the ATTR forms reported above (hATTR amyloidosis; hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, hATTR 
amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, and wtATTR amyloidosis) and concluded with a proposed overall 
prevalence of ATTR amyloidosis of 0.14 per 10,000 persons in the EU. The COMP considered this 
estimate to be acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of this review on orphan designation maintenance, Vyndaqel (tafamidis) is the only 
pharmacotherapeutic treatment available. Tafamidis is indicated for “treatment of transthyretin 
amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic 
impairment”; its use is therefore limited to early stage patients with mild disease.  
Since many of the systemic manifestations of the disease are caused by liver-derived circulating TTR, 
two treatment approaches aimed at reducing the amount of circulating amyloidogenic protein are 
currently used to treat patients with hATTR amyloidosis: (1) orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), 
which essentially eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation but does not affect the hepatic production 
of WT TTR by the transplanted liver, and (2) TTR tetramer stabilizers (e.g. tafamidis), which act by 
binding to the thyroxine-binding site on TTR to reduce its dissociation into misfolded amyloidogenic 
monomers.  
Significant benefit 
The efficacy of Onpattro was mainly studied in the APOLLO (ALN-TTR02-004) trial, which was a phase 
3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 225 patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with a TTR mutation and symptomatic polyneuropathy. The primary efficacy 
variable was the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) at 18 months. It is a composite 
neurologic impairment score that was developed specifically for monitoring progression of neurologic 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 6/10 
 
 
 
impairment in hATTR amyloidosis patients. It measures motor, sensory, and autonomic 
polyneuropathy including assessments of motor strength and reflexes, quantitative sensory testing, 
nerve conduction studies, and postural blood pressure, with the score ranging from 0 to 304 points, 
where a higher score indicates more pronounced impairment. The change from baseline in mNIS+7 
compared to placebo across all subgroups (age [<65; ≥65], gender, race [white, non-white], region 
[North America, Western Europe, Rest of World], NIS [< 50; ≥ 50], genotype [V30M; non-V30M], 
genotype class [Early onset V30M; Other], previous tetramer use, FAP stage [I& II ] and cardiac 
subpopulation) shows a consistent difference in favour of Onpattro (table 1, full study outcomes in 
Onpattro EPAR). 
Table 1.  Primary efficacy endpoint mNIS+7 at 18 months 
Significant benefit versus tafamidis is claimed based on the pivotal APOLLO clinical trial of Onpattro in 
familial amyloid neuropathy (FAP) showing favourable responses in patients that had previously 
discontinued tafamidis due to disease progression. APOLLO enrolled patients (n=74; 32.9%) that had 
previously received tafamidis for a mean duration of 13.5 months prior to study start. Of these 
patients, 25 discontinued tafamidis due to disease progression. These patients were of specific interest 
regarding the demonstration of significant benefit, because Onpattro led to a relevant improvement of 
the mNIS+7, the primary endpoint of the study, at 9 and 18 months of treatment (end of the study; 
figure 1B). The COMP considered that the claim of a significant benefit based on a clinically relevant 
advantage in patients who did not respond to previous treatment with tafamidis was sufficiently 
demonstrated.

Figure 1.  APOLLO study: benefit of Onpattro to patients who previously received tafamidis 
Panel A shows change in mNIS+7 for all patients who discontinued tafamidis treatment for any reason prior to entry 
into patisiran-LNP Study 004.  Panel B shows the change in mNIS+7 for all patients who discontinued tafamidis due 
to disease progression prior to entry into patisiran-LNP. 
Also indirect comparisons were provided between the pivotal trials of Onpattro and tafamidis. The 
results showed a bigger effect size of Onpattro vs. tafamidis on endpoints related to peripheral 
neuropathy, even though the overall patient population enrolled in the Onpattro trial was substantially 
more severe than the one in the tafamidis trial, as shown by baseline NIS-LL (Neurologic Impairment 
Score-Lower Limb; mean 36.8 at baseline in the Onpattro arm versus 8.4 in the tafamidis arm in the 
respective trials). When the comparison was limited to only stage I FAP, Onpattro showed a higher 
effect than tafamidis in reducing NIS-LL (– 8.2 points in patients treated with Onpattro versus -2.7 in 
patients treated with tafamidis). Similar results were shown for the other endpoints related to 
peripheral neuropathy. The COMP was of the opinion that the data discussed above, related to 
endpoints of peripheral neuropathy, demonstrated a significant benefit based on better efficacy of 
Onpattro versus tafamidis.  
The sponsor also claimed a benefit on the basis that the therapeutic indication of Onpattro includes 
stage II FAP, for which no medicinal product was so far authorised. Subgroup analyses of the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints show a consistent benefit of patisiran-LNP versus placebo across 
patients with stage 1 and stage 2 (table 2). The enlargement of the condition to include stage II was 
considered relevant but it was not highlighted as one of the main grounds for significant benefit. 
In conclusion, the COMP was of the opinion that sufficient evidence has been provided to conclude that 
Onpattro is of significant benefit over authorised tafamidis in the granted therapeutic indication.

4.  COMP position adopted on 30 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was  estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.14 in 
10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development of neuropathy 
and cardiomyopathy. Life expectancy is 3 to 15 years from symptom onset, depending on the 
transthyretin mutation; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Onpattro may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by 
the orphan condition is confirmed. Indirect comparison with tafamidis, currently authorized for 
stage I familial amyloid neuropathy, showed better efficacy of patisiran in the primary and in all 
secondary endpoints measuring different aspects of neuropathy. In addition the sponsor presented 
data showing clinical efficacy with patisiran in patients who had discontinued treatment with 
tafamidis due to disease progression. The committee considered that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Onpattro, synthetic double-
stranded siRNA oligonucleotide directed against transthyretin mRNA, patisiran, EU/3/11/857 for 
treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

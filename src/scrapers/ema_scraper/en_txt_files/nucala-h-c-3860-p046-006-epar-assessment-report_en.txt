1.  Introduction 
On 25 August 2017, the MAH submitted Part A (completed) of a paediatric study for Nucala 
(mepolizumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Part B of 
the study is on-going. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Currently in the EU, Nucala is centrally approved as a lyophilised powder for solution for injection as an 
add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients (EU/1/1/1043/001-001). 
The MAH stated that study 200363 ‘An open-label study to characterise the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in children from 6 to 11 years of age 
with severe eosinophilic asthma (Interim report; final Part A results only) is part of a clinical 
development program and that Part A of the Paediatric Study 200363 has been conducted in 
accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-PIP- 000069-02-10). Part B of this 
study is ongoing. The type II variation application supporting an indication in paediatric patients 
consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be 
submitted in Q4 2017. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed (Annex 1). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Mepolizumab was provided as a lyophilised cake in sterile vials for individual use. Prior to 
administration, the vial was reconstituted, with sterile Water for Injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted an interim report; final Part A results only, for: 
•  Study number 200363: ‘An open-label study to characterise the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in children from 6 to 11 
years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma’. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
This was a multi-centre, open-label, repeat dose study of mepolizumab in subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma, aged 6 to 11 years. 
This study consisted of 2 phases: 
• 
Part A (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic [PK/PD] phase) consisted of Pre-
Screening/Screening/Run-in, 12-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period;

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/58724/2018  
Page 3/15 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Part B (long-term safety/pharmacodynamic phase) consists of a 52-week long-term treatment 
period and 8-week follow-up period. 
On completion of Part B, subjects were offered entry into the long-term access programme until 
mepolizumab becomes commercially available for this age group, within the subject’s participating 
country. The Part B follow-up period was not required for subjects transitioning to the long-term access 
programme. 
The MAH has stated that the study report submitted in this Article 46 procedure describes Part A only. 
Part B is ongoing and will be reported separately.

Study design 
The PK and PD of either mepolizumab, 40 or 100 mg (depending on subject bodyweight), administered 
subcutaneously once every 4 weeks as an add-on to best standard of care, for a total duration of 12 
weeks, to subjects aged 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma, were assessed. The study also 
assessed safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of mepolizumab in this population along with clinical 
outcome measures, the ACQ-7 and the C-ACT.

A of the study can be found in Annex 2 at the end of this assessment report 
Study population /Sample size 
Number of subjects 
Approximately 40 subjects were to be screened to achieve approximately 28 eligible subjects entering 
the treatment phase, to allow for availability of 20 evaluable subjects, with a minimum of 6 subjects 
enrolled in the <40 kg bodyweight group (mepolizumab 40 mg SC dose). 
The sample size was determined by paediatric population PK trial simulation based on 1000 trial 
simulations per scenario. A sample size of 16 to 32 subjects was deemed sufficient to maintain 
precision in exposure estimation (and hence bodyweight-adjusted clearance) below 20%, (compared 
with the guideline 40% [FDA General Clinical Pharmacology Considerations for Pediatric Studies]), 
providing 5 PK samples (including 1 close to time of occurrence of Cmax [Tmax]) were collected and 4 
model parameters were fixed to adult values in the population PK model. 
For blood eosinophils, it was expected that this trial would have a similar residual variance to that 
observed in the Phase III exacerbation trial of mepolizumab in adults and adolescents (MEA115588). 
Based on this assumption, 20 subjects provided sufficient precision for the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the ratio to baseline to lie within 50% of the observed value. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
Males or females, between 6 and 11 years of age inclusive at screening with a diagnosis of severe 
asthma for at least 1 year, as defined by regional asthma guidelines, were eligible for inclusion. 
Subjects were required to have eosinophilic airway inflammation that was related to asthma; this was 
characterised as eosinophilic in nature as indicated by: a peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥300 
cells/μL demonstrated within 12 months of screening or a peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥150 
cells/μL at Visit 1. Subjects were also required to have a well-documented requirement for regular

treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>200 μg/day fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler 
[DPI] or equivalent daily) therapy, in the 12 months prior to Visit 1, with or without maintenance oral 
corticosteroids (OCS) and were to have been on current treatment with an additional controller 
medication for at least 3 months (or had a documented treatment failure in the past 12 months of an 
additional controller medication, for at least 3 successive months). Subjects were to have a persistent 
airflow obstruction at either Visit 1 or Visit 2 (a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 
second [FEV1] <110% predicted, or FEV1:forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <0.8) and had a confirmed 
history of 2 or more exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (CS), in the 12 
months prior to Visit 1, despite the use of ICS. For subjects receiving maintenance OCS, the treatment 
for the exacerbations must have been a 2-fold or greater increase in the CS dose. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary population used for all analyses of study population and safety measures was the Safety 
Population, which comprised all subjects receiving at least 1 dose of mepolizumab, beginning at Visit 2. 
The following analysis populations were used: 
•  Safety - all subjects receiving at least 1 dose of mepolizumab, beginning at Visit 2. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
PK - subjects from the Safety Population with at least 1 blood sample taken at Visit 3 or 
thereafter with a measurable mepolizumab plasma concentration. 
PD Blood Eosinophils (PDe) - subjects from the Safety Population with at least 1 blood sample 
evaluable for blood eosinophil count. 
PD Outcome Assessments (PDo) - subjects from the Safety Population with at least 1 
assessment of PD outcomes (ACQ-7, C-ACT, asthma exacerbation, FEV1, immunoglobulin [Ig]E 
or interleukin [IL]-5). 
PK/PD - subjects from the Safety Population with at least 1 blood sample taken at Visit 3 or 
thereafter with a measurable mepolizumab plasma concentration and with at least 1 blood 
sample evaluable for blood eosinophil count. 
Primary analysis population PK: Mepolizumab plasma PK concentrations collected during Part A of the 
study were analysed using the NLMIXED procedure in SAS software (Version 9.2). The most recent 
population-PK model (two-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination) 
was applied, with a number of PK distribution parameters fixed to adult values. Appropriateness of the 
final model was assessed using goodness of fit plots, simulations and a set of statistical tests. 
Primary analysis blood eosinophil counts: The ratio of blood eosinophil count to baseline (or change 
from baseline on the log scale) at Week 12 was summarised. The absolute blood eosinophil count and 
ratio to baseline was summarised, listed and graphically presented by visit for each mepolizumab dose 
and overall. 
All analyses were performed as pre-defined within the Reporting and Analysis Plan

This study was conducted at 13 centres; 3 in Japan, 2 in Poland, 6 in the United Kingdom and 2 in the 
United States. The first subject was enrolled into Part A on 25-Aug-2015 (first observation on the 
database) and the last subject completed Part A on 07-Dec-2016 (last observation on the database). 
Subject disposition 
Seven of the 44 subjects in the ‘All subjects enrolled’ population did not meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and 1 (2%) subject did not meet the continuation criteria, resulting in screening or run-in 
failures. A total of 36 subjects were enrolled to mepolizumab SC treatment (26 subjects to 40 mg 
[weight <40 kg] and 10 subjects to 100 mg [weight ≥40 kg]). Of these, 32 (89%) subjects completed 
Part A of the study. 
Summary of subject populations 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
A majority of the subjects in both groups were White. In the mepolizumab 40 mg group (weight <40 
kg; N=26), there was a higher proportion of male subjects whereas the male/female ratio was 
balanced in the mepolizumab 100 mg group (weight ≥40 kg; N=10). The mean body mass index was 
16.11 kg/m2 in the mepolizumab 40 mg group (weight <40 kg), 23.05 kg/m2 in the mepolizumab 100 
mg group (weight ≥40 kg) and 18.04 kg/m2 overall.

At Screening, of the 36 subjects enrolled to study treatment, 7 (19%) subjects were on medium dose 
ICS and 29 (81%) subjects were on high dose ICS. Overall, the median ICS dose was 500 μg/day 
fluticasone propionate (DPI) equivalent. 
In addition, a wide range of concomitant non-asthma medications were being used across most 
subjects (83%); the most common of which was cetirizine (22%).

For the PK analysis of mepolizumab plasma concentrations, 6 blood samples per subject were to be 
taken pre-dose at Week 4 and Week 8, at Week 9 for an approximate peak plasma concentration, at 
Week 12 and finally during the Follow-up phase at Weeks 16 and 20. A PK sample was also to be taken 
at the Early Withdrawal Visit (when applicable). The 36 subjects who received mepolizumab SC 
contributed a total of 202 blood samples to the analysis. No concentration data were excluded from the 
analysis. 
Population PK Analysis Results 
Mepolizumab population PK parameter estimates from the final model are presented in the table below. 
Parameters were normalised to 70 kg (typical adult bodyweight used for comparison with historic data) 
and mean bodyweights for the 2 weight groups: 50 kg (in the ≥40 kg group receiving 100 mg 
mepolizumab SC); and 27 kg (in the <40 kg group receiving 40 mg mepolizumab SC). Predicted 
AUC(0-inf) exposure normalised to 50 kg was within 1.5-fold of that normalised to 27 kg and both 
exposures were within 2-fold of the historical target adult value of 343 μg.day/mL from the Phase III 
exacerbation study MEA115588. Dose adjustment beyond that studied was therefore not deemed 
necessary in children age 6 to 11 years old. 
The bodyweight-adjusted apparent clearance (i.e., CL/F at 70 kg) point estimate and 90% CI of 0.20 
(90% CI: 0.17-0.22) L/day fell outside the 80% to 125% historical adult point estimate and range 
values of 0.29 (80%-125% interval: 0.23-0.36) L/day, implying a slightly lower CL/F in the 6 to 11 
year old population.

An exploratory population PK analysis, using the most recent meta-analysis PK model, estimated that a 
slightly higher SC absolute bioavailability of 105% (95% CI: 55-155%), rather than a lower clearance, 
is the most likely explanation for the difference in apparent clearance in the 6 to 11 years old 
population. The analysis confirmed that adult PK data can predict observations in children 6 to 11 
years old with severe eosinophilic asthma, after adjustment for bioavailability in this age group. 
Furthermore, after adjustment for bodyweight and bioavailability, age, gender and race were not 
covariates of mepolizumab exposure. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Blood eosinophil count 
Geometric mean baseline absolute blood eosinophil counts were 386, 331 and 370 cells/μL in the 
mepolizumab 40 mg SC (weight <40 kg), 100 mg SC (weight ≥40 kg) groups and overall, 
respectively. Marked, sustained, and similar reductions in blood eosinophil counts were observed at 
both doses. 
At Week 12, the geometric mean ratio of blood eosinophil count to baseline was 0.115 in the 
mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg), 0.166 in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group (weight 
≥40 kg) and 0.129 overall, indicating an 88.5%, 83.4% and 87.1% reduction, respectively. 
Total serum interleukin-5 
The majority of subjects in this study had total serum IL-5 level at baseline below the limit of 
quantification of the assay (<7.81 ng/L). Following administration of mepolizumab, total serum IL-5 
increased, as anticipated since the total serum IL-5 assay is measuring both free IL-5 and IL-5 bound 
to mepolizumab; thus, it was concluded that there was target engagement. 
Clinical assessment results 
Given the small sample size, short duration of treatment and uncontrolled design, the study was not 
designed to detect significant changes in the clinical assessments. 
Asthma control was characterised in this study through the use of the ACQ and C-ACT questionnaires. 
Overall, an improvement in asthma control was observed for the ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 responses. At 
Week 12, a ≥0.5-point reduction from baseline (minimally clinically important change) was observed in 
48% and 55% of subjects overall in the ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 questionnaires, respectively. For the C-ACT 
questionnaire, an increase in total score, suggesting an improvement in asthma control, was observed 
with a peak response at Visit 4 (Week 8) for the 2 treatment groups combined. No clear effect of 
mepolizumab was observed on FEV1 values. 
Following mepolizumab administration, on-treatment asthma exacerbations were reported in 28% of 
subjects. Four subjects required an on-treatment hospitalisation or emergency room visit, of which 3 
subjects were hospitalised; all subjects were in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg). 
Safety results 
Overall, mepolizumab was well tolerated in the study, and no new safety concerns were identified for 
this age group. The overall incidence of subjects reporting any on-treatment AE was 67%. Headache 
and injection site reaction (14% in both cases) were the most frequent on-treatment events overall. 
The System Organ Class (SOC) with the highest frequency of AEs was Infections and Infestations 
(50%).

Deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
No fatal SAEs were reported during this study. In total, 6 (17%) subjects reported on-treatment SAEs, 
the majority (5/6 subjects) of which were reported by subjects in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group 
(weight <40 kg). Asthma and lower respiratory tract infection were the SAEs reported by more than 1 
subject in either treatment group (asthma by 3 subjects in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group and 
lower respiratory tract infection was reported for 1 subject in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC [weight <40 
kg] and 1 subject in the mepolizumab 100 mg SC group [weight ≥40 kg]); all other SAEs were only 
reported for 1 subject overall. Two subjects had on-treatment non-fatal SAEs that were considered 
drug-related (SAEs of back pain, chest pain, dizziness, headache, nausea and pain were observed in 1 
subject and an SAE of asthma (worsening) was reported in another subject), both subjects were in the 
40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
AESIs in this study included systemic (non-allergic and allergic/hypersensitivity) reactions, local 
injection site reactions, cardiac disorders including cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic and serious 
ischemic events, infections, and malignancies. No on-treatment events of anaphylaxis, malignancies, 
or cardiac AESIs were reported. The most commonly reported on-treatment AESIs were local injection 
site reactions, reported by 5 (14%) subjects in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group (weight <40 kg); all 
were non-serious and mild in intensity. In addition, 1 subject in the mepolizumab 40 mg SC group 
(weight <40 kg) had a non-serious event of mild intensity hypersensitivity with associated symptoms 
of pruritus. Three subjects had infections that were considered serious whilst on-treatment: 2 subjects 
had a serious on-treatment event of lower respiratory tract infection and 1 subject had a serious on-
treatment event of cellulitis. All events resolved without any dose interruption or changes to 
mepolizumab treatment.

One subject had a post-treatment SAE of campylobacter infection of moderate intensity, and 1 subject 
had a non-serious post-treatment AE of mild mitral valve incompetence. Both events were in the 40 
mg SC group (weight <40 kg) and were not resolved at the time of reporting. 
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
The frequency of positive ADA samples in the study was low (2/35 subjects, 1 subject in each dose 
group; 6% overall). The titres were low, and the presence of ADAs was transient in the 2 ADA positive 
subjects with negative results at all subsequent visits. No subjects tested positive for neutralising 
antibodies at any time point. The AE profiles were comparable between subjects who tested positive 
for ADA and those who were negative at all time points. 
Other safety parameters 
There were no apparent treatment related changes in clinical laboratory parameters, ECGs or vital 
signs. 
In summary, there were no new safety concerns following treatment with mepolizumab (40 mg or 100 
mg SC) compared with adults and adolescents with severe eosinophilic asthma following treatment 
with mepolizumab 100 mg SC. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In the EU, currently Nucala (mepolizumab) is centrally approved as an add-on treatment for severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. 
The MAH has submitted Part A (completed) of the paediatric study 200363 ‘An open-label study to 
characterise the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab administered 
subcutaneously in children from 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma’, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This study is part of a clinical 
development program and Part A of study 200363 has been conducted in accordance with an agreed 
paediatric investigation plan. Part B of this study is ongoing. The MAH plans to submit a type II 
variation application supporting an indication in paediatric patients consisting of the full relevant data 
package, including several studies as listed in Annex 1, in Q4 2017. Therefore, no updates to the 
Nucala product information are proposed by the MAH as part of this Article 46 submission. 
Whilst a description of Part A of study 200363 with a summary of the methods and results provided by 
the company have been described above, as only Part A of the study is complete and the results from 
this study are intended to be integrated with the other agreed PIP measures to support the planned 
type II extension of indication variation procedure in Q4 2017, a full assessment of study 200363 has 
not been undertaken at this time. 
The sample size in this study was small (36) and it was an open-label uncontrolled study, therefore 
limiting the ability of the study to assess the secondary efficacy and safety objectives. However, no 
new safety signals were identified in Part A of the study. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

Brief description of the 
product
Chemical class:  humanized immunoglobulin G4-proline, alanine, alanine 
(IgG4-PAA) bispecific antibody
Summary of mode of action: 
Teclistamab is a full-size, IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody that targets the 
cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of 
T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed on the 
surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage 
B cells and plasma cells. With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to 
draw CD3+ T cells in close proximity to BCMA+ cells, resulting in T cell 
activation and subsequent lysis and death of BCMA+ cells, which is 
mediated by secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in the secretory 
vesicles of cytotoxic T cells. This effect occurs without regard to T cell 
receptor specificity or reliance on major histocompatability complex 
(MHC) Class 1 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. 
Important information about its composition:  
Teclistamab is a humanized IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody directed against 
the BCMA and CD3 receptors, produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese 
hamster ovary [CHO]) using recombinant DNA technology.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI:  Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Indication:  Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a rare, malignant plasma cell disorder that represents approximately 1% to 
1.8% of all new cancer cases and approximately 10% of hematological malignancies (Sung 2021; 
SEER 2021). The disease is considered incurable (Rajkumar 2020).
Incidence
In 2020, an estimated 176,404 patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma globally, with a 
crude incidence rate of 2.3 cases per 100,000 persons and a world population age-standardized 
incidence rate of 1.8 cases per 100,000 persons (Ferlay 2020). 
In  the  European  Union  (EU;  27  countries),  the  2020  crude  incidence  rate  was  8.0 cases  per 
100,000 persons,  and  the  European  population  age-adjusted  incidence  rate  was  7.5 cases  per 
100,000 persons (European Cancer Information System [ECIS] 2021). The estimated number of 
new cases for the EU overall was 35,842. Similarly, the annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 
6.8  per  100,000  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  with  4,440  cases  (Haematological  Malignancy 
Research Network [HMRN] 2021). In general, Western Europe had the highest incidence rates of 
multiple myeloma, with a crude incidence rate of 9.2 per 100,000 persons (ECIS 2021). Crude 
incidence rates ranged from 2.5 per 100,000 persons in Bulgaria to 10.3 per 100,000 persons in 
France.
Prevalence
Worldwide,  the  estimated  5-year  prevalence  in  2020  was  approximately  450,579  patients 
(Ferlay 2020). In Europe, the 5-year prevalence count of multiple myeloma was 138,083 persons. 
Estimates for 10-year or total prevalence count and proportions of multiple myeloma are available 
from select European countries with longer data collection, as shown in Table SI.1. The prevalence 
data for France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are estimated for 2020 using 10 years of collected or 
projected data, as described by Kantar Health’s CancerMPact® program methods. The UK 10-year 
prevalence  and  Nordic  countries’  total  prevalence  comes  from  their  respective  cancer  registry 
estimates in 2016.

The prevalence of multiple myeloma has increased in the past few decades due to better diagnostic 
techniques and improved patient survival, owing to widespread use of autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation and the development of novel therapeutic agents (Turesson 2018).
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication — Age, Sex, Racial and/or Ethnic 
Origin and Risk Factors for the Disease
Age: The median age at multiple myeloma diagnosis is approximately 69 to 71 years (SEER 2021; 
Palumbo 2011). Myeloma incidence is strongly related to age, with older adults experiencing the 
highest incidence rates. At diagnosis, 36% of patients are younger than 65 years, 31% are aged 
65 to 74 years, and 33% are 75 years of age or older (SEER 2021).
Gender: The incidence of multiple myeloma is approximately 1.5 times higher in men than women 
(Blimark 2018). Globally in 2020, the age-standardized incidence rate of multiple myeloma was 
estimated to be 2.2 per 100,000 in men and 1.5 per 100,000 in women (Sung 2021). In the United 
States  (US) in  2018,  the  incidence  rates  are  8.8  per  100,000  in  men  versus  5.7  per  100,000  in 
women (SEER 2021).
Racial and ethnic origin: The incidence of multiple myeloma is 2 times higher in Black individuals 
than in White individuals but is lower in Asian and Hispanic individuals versus White persons 
(SEER*Explorer 2021). In the US, the average incidence rate from 2014 to 2018 was 13.8 per 
100,000  for  Blacks  and  6.5  per  100,000  persons  for  Whites  (SEER  2021).  Evidence  from  US 
studies  suggests  that  the  racial  disparity  may  be  influenced  by  differences  in  risk  factors  for 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and transformation of MGUS to 
multiple myeloma between Black and White patients (Marinac 2020).
Other  risk  factors  for  multiple  myeloma:  Although  there  is  a  notably  higher  risk  of  multiple 
myeloma in older adults, men, and Black individuals, there is limited evidence on the underlying 
social, biological, or genetic factors increasing the risk of multiple myeloma in these populations. 
In  a  large  case-control  study,  the  odds  of  multiple  myeloma  were  elevated  in  patients  whose 
relatives had any hematologic malignancy versus none (odds ratio 1.89; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.25-2.86),  suggesting  that  family  history  of  hematologic  malignancies  is  a  potential

predictor of disease (VanValkenburg 2016). Other potential risk factors for developing multiple 
myeloma  include  being  overweight  or  obese,  having  workplace  exposure  to  chemicals  or 
pesticides, and increased alcohol intake (Perrotta 2013; Sergentanis 2015).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Treatments  approved  for  multiple  myeloma  vary  by  country  and  patient  population  (newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma versus relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma). The treatment options 
approved in the EU include the following: 


Stem cell transplant (usually autologous but allogeneic is a later-line option)
Chemotherapeutic 
bendamustine, and doxorubicin);
agents 
(melphalan,  vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide, 
 Histone deacetylase inhibitors (panobinostat);
 Monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab);


Immunomodulatory agents (ImiDs including thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide);
Proteasome inhibitors (Pis including bortezomib, ixazomib, and carfilzomib);
 Nuclear export inhibitor (selinexor);
 Anti-BCMA targeted treatment (idecabtagene vicleucel, belantamab mafodotin);

Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisone, prednisone).
In  US  and  European  guidelines,  treatment  approaches  depend  on  patient  fitness  and  risk  of 
toxicities  (National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  [NCCN] 2021;  Dimopoulos  2021).  The 
initial  evaluation  of  patients  includes  an  assessment  of  eligibility  for  high-dose  therapy  and 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) based on age, performance status, and comorbidities. 
Transplant eligible  patients  will  typically  receive  induction therapy followed  by  high-dose 
chemotherapy  and  ASCT;  consolidation  and/or  maintenance  therapy  is  utilized  after  ASCT 
depending upon the country. Recommended initial therapy for transplant ineligible patients is a 
daratumumab 
lenalidomide-
(Dimopoulos 2021). Bisphosphonate treatment is  often started along with therapy to treat bone 
disease (Terpos 2013). If the areas of damaged bone continue to cause symptoms, radiation therapy 
may be used.

Despite advances in treatment options, multiple myeloma remains incurable and is characterized 
by patterns of remissions and relapses until death. With each successive relapse and new line of 
treatment, the chance of response, duration of response, and median overall survival (OS) typically 
decreases  (Gandhi  2019).  A  recent  prospective  observational  study  evaluated  the  outcomes  of 
246 patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma  who  were  triple  class  exposed 
(Moreau 2021). The study enrolled patients from 10 countries; patients had to have received at 
least 3 prior lines of therapy or be considered double refractory to a PI and an ImiD. All patients 
were triple class exposed, 75% were triple class refractory, and 93% were refractory to the last line

of therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) was 28%. With a median duration of follow up of 
7.8 months, the median duration of response was 5.1 months, the median progression-free survival 
(PFS) was 4.4 months, and the median OS was 12.4 months. Similar to the prospective study, an 
earlier retrospective medical record review of 275 patients from 14 academic institutions in the 
United States found that patients who were refractory to anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies had a 
dismal  prognosis.  The  median  OS  for  the  entire  cohort  was  8.6  months  (95%  CI:  7.5,  9.9) 
(Gandhi 2019). Patients who became refractory to anti CD38 therapy and received ≥1 subsequent 
treatment had an ORR of 31%, with a median PFS and median OS of 3.4 months and 9.3 months, 
respectively. The median OS for patients who received no further treatment was 1.3 months.
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
Multiple myeloma is one of multiple disorders termed a plasma cell dyscrasia (Kyle 2018). Plasma 
cell  dyscrasias  are  a  spectrum  of  progressively  more  severe  monoclonal  gammopathies,  which 
range from pre-malignant conditions, such as MGUS and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), 
to paraneoplastic conditions, like amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis and POEMS syndrome, to 
malignant  conditions,  like  Waldenstrom’s  macroglobulinemia  and  multiple  myeloma.  Patients 
diagnosed with MGUS are 3.1 times more likely to develop multiple myeloma in 20 years than 
those without MGUS. Almost all cases of multiple myeloma evolve from the MGUS precursor 
stage,  especially  among  patients  with  an  immunoglobulin  M  (IgM) MGUS. (Landgren  2009; 
Kyle 2018). Over 50% of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma had MGUS for at least 
10 years before progression (Kyle 2018). The risk of progression to multiple myeloma is estimated 
to be approximately 1% per year (Langren 2009).
Another plasma cell dyscrasia preceding active multiple myeloma is SMM, an asymptomatic stage 
of  disease  without  end  organ  damage.  Smoldering  multiple  myeloma  (SMM) progresses  to 
multiple  myeloma  at  a  rate  of  approximately  10%  per  year  over  the  first  5 years  following 
diagnosis,  3%  per  year  over  the  next  5 years,  and  1.5%  per  year  thereafter  (Kyle  2007; 
Ghobrial 2014). 
In Europe, there were an estimated 23,275 deaths from multiple myeloma in 2020 (ECIS 2021). 
Multiple myeloma is the 17th most common cause of death in the 27 European Union countries, 
with  an  age-standardized  mortality  rate  of  4.8  per  100,000  (ECIS  2021).  The  5-year  relative 
survival for multiple myeloma patients is 48% in the UK in 2016 and ranged from 45.6% to 60.3% 
in  Nordic  countries  (HMRN  2021;  NORDCAN  2021).  Five-year  survival  decreases  as  age 
increases. For example, the 5-year relative survival in Sweden was 66% for patients 65 years and 
younger  and  39%  for  patients  >65  years  (Blimark  2018).  The  median  overall  survival  was 
approximately 4.6 years in the Swedish Myeloma Registry in 2016.
Multiple  factors  are  considered  in  risk  stratification  for  multiple  myeloma.  The  International 
Staging System [ISS] and Durie-Salmon staging are both older tools that stratify patients according 
to patient characteristics and tumor burden (Greipp 2005; Durie 1975). Updated evidence suggests 
that cytogenetic abnormalities seen in myeloma cells are one of the strongest predictors of tumor 
aggressiveness. The revised ISS (R-ISS) was introduced as a risk stratification tool for multiple 
10

Risk Management Plan Version 3.2
20 Sept 2023
myeloma  in  2015  and  considers  patient  cytogenetic  risk  factors  along  with  serum  lactate 
dehydrogenase  levels,  serum  albumin,  and  serum  beta-2-microglobulin  (Palumbo  2015).  In 
11 pooled trials, the 5-year OS rate was 82% in the R-ISS I, 62% in the R-ISS II, and 40% in the 
R-ISS III groups at a median follow-up of 46 months. 
High  risk  cytogenetic  abnormalities  in  the  R-ISS  include  t(4;14),  t(14;16),  or  del(17p) 
(Palumbo 2015; Rajkumar 2020). Patients with standard risk multiple myeloma have an estimated 
median survival of 7 to 10 years, while patients with high-risk cytogenetics have a median survival 
closer  to  5  years  (Rajan  2015).  As  new  treatments  are  introduced,  the  difference  in  survival  is 
narrowing  between patients  with  standard  risk  cytogenetics  and  certain  high-risk  cytogenetic 
abnormalities,  like  del(17p),  suggesting  that  individual  cytogenetic  abnormalities  should  be 
considered in risk stratification (Rajkumar 2020). 
Multiple myeloma is defined as clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10%, or biopsy-proven bony 
or extramedullary plasmacytoma, and evidence of myeloma defining events. These include either 
end organ damage, including elevated calcium, renal failure, anemia, or lytic bone lesions (CRAB) 
or biomarkers of malignancy (Rajkumar 2020). Tumor-induced bone destruction and the resulting 
bone disease is the main cause of morbidity during multiple myeloma. 
Anemia can arise as a result of myelosuppression, where the clonal plasma cells crowd out the 
normal blood cells or reduce production of blood cells and platelets. Ongoing anemia can lead to 
arrhythmias, heart failure, dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness. Baseline renal impairment can worsen, 
largely  as  a  result  of  M-protein  build-up  in  the  kidneys,  hypercalcemia,  or  hyperuricemia,  and 
result in end stage  renal disease  (Dimopoulos  2008).  Additionally, hypercalcemia can result in 
nausea/vomiting, constipation, confusion, and hypercalcemic crisis.
Other  conditions  related  to  the  disease  are  also  anticipated.  Hyperviscosity  syndrome  and 
cryoglobulinemia  can  arise  due  to  increased  circulating  serum  immunoglobulins  in  multiple 
myeloma  (Talamo  2010).  In  addition  to  causing  anemia,  myelosuppression  due  to  the  clonal 
plasma  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  can  lead  to  leukopenia,  especially  neutropenia,  and 
thrombocytopenia. 
Neutropenia is present at diagnosis in approximately 6% of patients and is associated with a  higher 
risk of infection (Augustson 2005; Palumbo 2012). According to a study of 9,253 patients with 
multiple  myeloma  and  34,931  matched  controls  without  hematologic  malignancy  conducted  in 
Sweden  between  2004  and  2007,  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  have  a  7-fold  higher  risk  of 
infections due to clonal plasma cells affecting immune system activities (Blimark 2015). The risk 
of  infections  was  11-fold  greater  during  the  first  year  following  diagnosis.  The  most  common 
infections were meningitis, septicemia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and pyelonephritis. 
The risk of viral infections was 10-fold higher overall and 18-fold higher during the first  year. 
Influenza infection and herpes zoster were the most frequent viral infections. Patients with multiple 
myeloma  display  a  7.5  times  higher  hazard of  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism
within the first year of disease than the general matched Swedish population (Kristinsson 2010).

Additional plasma cell dyscrasias that did not exist at diagnosis may also arise during multiple 
myeloma,  including  plasmacytomas,  plasma  cell  leukemia,  AL  amyloidosis,  and  Waldenstrom 
macroglobulinemia.  The  rate  of  extramedullary  disease  (EMD)  in  the  first  3  years  following 
diagnosis was 3% (Short 2011).
Important Co-morbidities:
Compared with a matched general population, patients with multiple myeloma have significantly 
higher  odds  of  the  following  comorbidities  that  are  unrelated  to  the  disease  in  the  year  before 
multiple myeloma diagnosis: congestive heart failure, connective tissue disease, ulcers, mild liver 
disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus with chronic complications, metastatic solid 
tumors,  and  lymphoma  (Gregersen  2017).  Moderate to  severe  lung  disease  is  an  important 
predictor for survival that is unrelated to multiple myeloma and included in the revised multiple 
myeloma comorbidity index (Engelhardt 2017).

Key Safety Findings
Toxicity
Single & repeat-dose toxicity
A 5-week repeat dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys was performed 
administering teclistamab intravenously, once 
weekly. No toxicities were observed in any 
measured parameter.
Reproductive toxicity
No reproductive toxicity studies were 
conducted with teclistamab.
Reproductive toxicity studies (eg. Fertility and 
early embryonic development studies) are 
generally not applicable to therapies for 
advanced cancer indications (ICH S9).
Developmental toxicity
No developmental toxicity studies were 
conducted with teclistamab.
Developmental toxicity studies (pre- and 
postnatal development studies) are generally 
not applicable to therapies for advanced cancer 
indications (ICH S9); however, an assessment 
of embryo-fetal development toxicity are 
needed to support marketing applications 
[ICH S5(R3) and ICH M3(R2)].
Relevance to Human Usage
The lack of pharmacodynamic (eg, cytokine release or 
transient lymphocyte decreases) or toxicological 
response to teclistamab was attributed to a 
combination of lower number of plasma cells (and 
consequently low expression of BCMA) in a healthy 
cynomolgus monkey compared with a multiple 
myeloma patient and limited cross-reactivity of 
teclistamab to cynomolgus monkey BCMA relative to 
human BCMA. Translation to human usage may be 
limited. Based on expression of BCMA on a subset of 
mature B cells and plasma cells, depletion of these 
cells is expected which may result in increased risk of 
infection and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Expression of BCMA in reproductive tissues was 
studied in an examination of 33 tissues for BCMA 
protein by immunohistochemistry using a 
commercially available polyclonal antibody. B cell 
maturation antigen (BCMA) was not detected in 
female reproductive organs such as uterus, fallopian 
tubes, ovary, and placenta, or in male reproductive 
organs such as prostate and testis (Carpenter 2013).
No test-article related microscopic findings were 
noted in the histopathology examination of the pivotal 
repeat dose toxicity study, including juvenile male 
(epididymis, prostate, and testis) and juvenile female 
(cervix, uterus, and vagina) reproductive tissues.
Developmental toxicity, including pregnancy and 
lactation, was not considered essential to inform risk 
to pregnant women based on the intended patient 
population and BCMA target biology including data 
from genetically modified mice that lack BCMA. 
Therefore, it was not assessed in nonclinical studies.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are known to 
cross the human placenta during pregnancy and have 
been detected in the serum of infants born to patients 
treated with therapeutic antibodies (Hyrich 2014).

Key Safety Findings
Genotoxicity
Routine genotoxicity studies are generally not 
applicable to biological pharmaceuticals as 
large proteins cannot diffuse into cells and 
cannot interact with DNA or chromosomal 
material (ICH S6).
Carcinogenicity
No standard carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted with teclistamab.
Standard carcinogenicity studies are generally 
not applicable to therapies for advanced cancer 
indications (ICH S9).
Safety pharmacology:
Cardiovascular system (including potential 
for QT interval prolongation)
No cardiovascular effects were identified in the 
5-week cynomolgus monkey study.
Nervous system
No nervous system effects were identified in
the 5-week cynomolgus monkey study.
Nephrotoxicity
No nephrotoxicity was identified in the clinical 
and anatomic pathology assessment in the 
5-week cynomolgus monkey study.
Hepatotoxicity
No hepatotoxicity was identified in the clinical 
and anatomic pathology assessments in the 
5-week cynomolgus monkey study.
Risk Management Plan Version 3.2
20 Sept 2023
Relevance to Human Usage
Teclistamab is not expected to be genotoxic.
Teclistamab is not expected to be carcinogenic.
Based on the nonclinical data, teclistamab is not 
expected to affect cardiovascular function or induce 
QT prolongation. While there is restricted expression 
of BCMA on B-lineage cells, cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS), a known toxicity associated with 
T cell activating therapies, may affect safety 
pharmacology parameters (Lee 2014; Lee 2019).
Based on nonclinical data, no BCMA protein 
expression could be detected in normal human adult 
brain and teclistamab is not expected to affect the 
nervous system function; however, neurotoxicity 
(eg, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome [ICANS] and other neurotoxicities) is a 
known potential toxicity with bispecific antibodies 
that engage T cells (Salvaris 2021)
Based on the nonclinical data, teclistamab is not 
expected to be nephrotoxic. Renal injury could occur 
as a manifestation of CRS (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 
2018). Renal insufficiency is common in multiple 
myeloma (Dimopoulos 2008).
Based on the nonclinical data, teclistamab is not 
expected to be hepatotoxic. However, CRS, a known 
toxicity associated with T cell activating therapies, 
may present with hepatotoxicity 
(Shimabukuro-Vornhagen 2018).

Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
The relationship between immunogenicity in animals 
and humans is not well established and results in 
animals are not expected to be predictive of the 
human immunogenic response.
Consistent with the mechanism of action, cytokine 
release is expected with T-cell redirecting therapies 
and the risk mitigation strategy has been implemented 
clinically.
Other toxicity-related information or data
Immunogenicity
In a repeat dose toxicity study, 21 out of 
30 cynomolgus monkeys developed 
measurable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 1, 
10, and 30 mg/kg/week following 5 weeks of 
dosing, of which 7 animals exhibited a faster 
decrease in teclistamab concentration. No 
cynomolgus monkeys had ADA-related 
toxicity.
Cytokine Release Assay
Teclistamab was evaluated for potential to 
stimulate release of cytokines in an in vitro 
soluble format 48 hour diluted whole blood 
model system using blood from human donors. 
Teclistamab induced statistically significant 
but low-level release of interleukin (IL)-8, 
interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α compared to that of the negative 
control (phosphate buffered saline) at 
concentrations greater than or equal to 
82 ng/mL.

Module SIII:  Clinical Trial Exposure
SIII.1.
Brief Overview of Development
The safety of teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) in the multiple myeloma population is  supported by 
one clinical  trial  in  this  EU RMP,  ie,  Trial 64007957MMY1001  (also  known  as  MajesTEC-1; 
hereafter referred to as MMY1001). 
Trial MMY1001 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter trial of teclistamab administered 
as monotherapy to adult subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Phase 1 included
Part  1  (dose  escalation)  and  Part  2  (dose  expansion)  and  evaluated the  safety,  PK,  and 
pharmacodynamics of teclistamab, as well as selection and preliminary evaluation of the proposed 
recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds). The RP2D to be further evaluated was determined to be 
1.5 mg/kg of teclistamab administered subcutaneously (SC) weekly, preceded by step-up doses of 
0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg. 
During Phase 2 (Part 3), the pivotal RP2D was evaluated in cohorts of subjects that differed by 
prior therapies. Cohort A is the patient population that aligns with the intended indication, and 
includes patients with multiple myeloma who are triple class exposed (PI, ImiD, and an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody) and have previously received ≥3 prior lines of therapy.
The RMP  includes data  from subjects  who received the pivotal RP2D  (hereafter referred to as 
RP2D), either  in  Phase 1  or  in  Cohort  A  of  Phase  2.  The  clinical  cutoff  date  for  clinical  trial 
exposure is 4 January 2023. As of that data cutoff date, this includes 165 subjects.

SIV.1.
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 1
Pregnant or breast-feeding
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Per ICH guidelines, pregnant women should normally be 
excluded from clinical trials. No reproductive toxicity 
studies have been conducted in the preclinical setting. 
Breast-feeding women are usually excluded from clinical 
trials. It is not known whether teclistamab is excreted in 
human or animal milk or affects milk production.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 2
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Pregnancy and breast-feeding is uncommon in this heavily 
pretreated patient population, and thus use in these 
patients is not considered missing information. SmPC 
Section 4.6 states that teclistamab is not recommended for 
women who are pregnant, and that women of 
child-bearing potential should use effective contraception 
during treatment and for 5 months after the final dose of 
teclistamab.
Known to be seropositive for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
HIV or AIDS from clinical trials of anticancer therapy 
because it potentially places patients with these 
comorbidities at increased risk for severe adverse events 
and also may confound the interpretation of safety. 
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
This is consistent with standard of care.

Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 3
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Active Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus 
(HCV) infection
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
active HBV or HCV infections from clinical trials on 
anticancer therapy because they potentially place patients 
with these comorbidities at increased risk for severe 
adverse events and also may confound the interpretation 
of safety.
Considered to be included as missing
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
It is consistent with standard of care to not treat patients 
with active infections. The SmPC states that patients with 
evidence of positive HBV serology should be monitored 
for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation 
while receiving teclistamab, and for at least 6 months 
following the end of treatment.
Criterion 4
The following cardiac conditions:
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
 New York Heart Association stage III or IV 
congestive heart failure
 Myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass 
graft (CABG) ≤6 months prior to enrollment
 History of clinically significant ventricular 
arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not believed 
to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration
 History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
It is common clinical practice not to include patients with 
potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions in trials on 
anticancer therapy because it may potentially place 
patients with these comorbidities at increased risk for 
adverse events, and it may confound the interpretation of 
safety data.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
There are no specific data on the use of teclistamab in 
patients with significant cardiac disease. The treating 
physician would be expected to weigh the benefit and 
risks for each individual patient.

Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 5
Any serious underlying medical condition, such as:
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
 Evidence of serious active viral, bacterial, or 
uncontrolled systemic fungal infection
 Active autoimmune disease or a documented 
history of autoimmune disease with the exception 
of vitiligo, type I diabetes, and prior autoimmune 
thyroiditis that is currently euthyroid based on 
clinical symptoms and laboratory testing
 Psychiatric conditions (eg, alcohol or drug abuse), 
dementia, or altered mental status

Stroke or seizure within 6 months of signing the 
informed consent form.
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
uncontrolled infections from clinical trials on anticancer 
therapy because it potentially places patients with these 
comorbidities at increased risk for severe adverse events,
and it may confound the interpretation of safety data. 
Also, infection may complicate the course and 
management of CRS.
It is common clinical practice not to include patients with 
autoimmune diseases in oncology clinical trials because it 
may potentially place patients at increased risk for 
immune-related side effects, and may confound the 
interpretation of safety data.
Neurologic toxicities have been reported with bispecific 
T-cell redirectors. Therefore, inclusion of patients with 
altered mental status or previous stroke or seizure may 
confound analysis of neurologic toxicity and may increase 
risk to patients with these types of underlying conditions.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
The SmPC includes a recommendation to delay the initial 
doses of teclistamab until any active infection has 
resolved.
There are no specific data on the use of teclistamab in 
patients with autoimmune disease or recent stroke or 
seizure. The treating physician would be expected to 
weigh the benefit and risks for each individual patient.

Known active central nervous system (CNS)
involvement or exhibits clinical signs of meningeal 
involvement of multiple myeloma
Neurologic toxicities have been reported with bispecific

known CNS involvement may increase their risk of 
neurologic toxicities.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 7
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
There are no specific data on the use of teclistamab in 
patients with active CNS involvement. The treating 
physician would be expected to weigh the benefit and 
risks for each individual patient.
Active malignancies (ie, progressing or requiring 
treatment change in the last 24 months) other than 
multiple myeloma, with exceptions of non-muscle 
invasive bladder cancer, skin cancer, noninvasive 
cervical cancer, localized prostate cancer, certain 
forms of breast cancer, or malignancies considered to 
be cured with minimal risk of recurrence
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
other active malignancies from clinical trials to allow a 
minimal interval of time since prior therapies, in order to 
avoid overlapping toxicities from anticancer therapies.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing

Method used to Calculate Exposure
Reporting  frequencies  calculated  using  exposure  data  do  not  reflect  occurrence  rates.  Multiple 
factors influence the reporting of spontaneous experiences and therefore, caution must be exercised 
in the analysis and evaluation of spontaneous reports. In addition, product exposure is estimated 
at the time of distribution, not at the time of usage. There is a delay between the time medication 
is distributed until it is used by a patient.
Patient exposure was estimated by calculation from distribution data. Estimates of exposure are 
based upon finished product. Region specific bodyweight has been used to calculate exposure.
At  the  time  of  the  RMP  data  lock  point  (28  February  2023),  the  recommended  dosing  was
1.5 mg/kg actual body weight administered once weekly after completion of the step-up dosing 
schedule. For step-up dosing, an average duration of 3 days is considered based on the statement 
“Two to 4 days after Step-up Dose”. Considering this, the average is 53 doses/per year (ie, 2 step-
up doses and 51 treatment doses) assuming a compliance rate of 100%. The dosing schedules have 
been provided as:


Cytokine release syndrome
Neurologic toxicity
Serious infections
Risk-Benefit Impact
Cytokine release syndrome is a known class effect associated with 
T-cell redirector therapy including bispecific antibodies that bind to 
CD3. While CRS may be life-threatening or fatal, the majority of 
CRS events in the clinical trial were Grade 1 or Grade 2. All events 
of CRS were effectively managed with available treatments. 
Detailed guidance for how to manage and mitigate this risk is 
provided in the SmPC and PL and reflects the guidance followed by 
investigators in the clinical trial. Follow-up data from Studies
MMY1001 and 64007957MMY3001 (hereafter referred to as 
MMY3001) will provide further information on the risk of CRS. A 
Patient Card is included as an additional risk minimization measure 
to further mitigate the risk of CRS. Overall, the risk-benefit balance 
is positive for the product considering the severity of the proposed 
indication, the demonstrated efficacy for patients treated with 
teclistamab, and the low grade severity of CRS observed in the 
clinical trial.
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect 
associated with T-cell redirector therapies. While neurologic 
toxicities, including ICANS, may be life-threatening or fatal, all 
ICANS events in the teclistamab clinical trial as of the 
16 March 2022 cutoff date were Grade 1 or Grade 2.
Neurologic toxicities were effectively managed with available 
treatments. Detailed guidance for how to manage and mitigate 
ICANS is provided in the SmPC and PL. Follow-up data from 
Studies MMY1001 and MMY3001 will provide further information 
on the risk of neurologic toxicity. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is 
positive for the product considering the severity of the proposed 
indication, the demonstrated efficacy for patients treated with 
teclistamab, and the low grade severity of neurologic toxicities 
observed in clinical trials.
Serious infections including pneumonia and sepsis have been 
reported in the teclistamab clinical trial. Teclistamab is expected to 
reduce B cells which may lead to hypogammaglobulinemia, 
resulting in the increase of serious infection including HBV 
reactivation. Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow disorder of 
immune system cells (plasma cells) with impaired immune function, 
thus the incidence of serious infection in this refractory and 
relapsing population is expected to be high. Follow-up data from 
Studies MMY1001 will provide further information on the risk of 
serious infections. Serious infection also will be monitored in the 
planned phase 3 trial (MMY3001) with comparators to further 
evaluate the causality of serious infection with teclistamab.

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks
Important Identified Risk: Cytokine release syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
Teclistamab targets the CD3 receptor on T cells and BCMA on B cells and subsequently promotes
T cell activation and causes cytokines to be released, which may result in CRS. The increase in 
29
TECVAYLI (teclistamab)
Risk Management Plan Version 3.2
20 Sept 2023
multiple cytokines, in particular IL-10, IL-6, and IL-2R, was noted during step-up dosing and the 
first cycle of teclistamab. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cytokine  release  syndrome is  a  known  class  effect  associated  with  T-cell  redirector therapy 
including bispecific antibodies that bind to CD3. Cytokine release syndrome has been reported in 
subjects treated in the teclistamab clinical trial and was identified as an adverse reaction. The risk 
for CRS and information regarding this adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for teclistamab. 
Based on the strength of evidence from the clinical trial data and information from the literature, 
CRS is considered an important identified risk for teclistamab.

complications  of  CRS  may  include  cardiac  dysfunction,  adult  respiratory  distress  syndrome, 
neurologic toxicity, renal or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
At RP2D in Trial MMY1001, CRS was reported for 72.1% of subjects. One subject had a Grade 3 
event and all other events were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The median time from last teclistamab injection 
to new onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1 to 6 days). The median duration of CRS was 2 days, 
with duration ranging from 1 to 9 days. All events of CRS resolved.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
The risk factors of CRS are not fully identified; however, active infection may increase the severity 
of CRS. Active infection was an exclusionary criterion in clinical trials.
Preventability:
Teclistamab should be initiated using step-up dosing to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS.
The step-up dosing schedule should not be started in patients with active infection. Pretreatment 
medication should be administered for all patients prior to each dose in the Step-up dosing schedule 
(which includes the first full maintenance dose). Patients should be instructed to remain within the 
proximity of a healthcare facility and be monitored daily for 48 hours after administration of all 
doses in the step-up dosing schedule. At the first sign of CRS, patients should be evaluated for 
hospitalization, and treatment (which may include tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids) should be 
started. For  any  patient  who  has  experienced  CRS,  pretreatment  medication  should  be 
administered prior to their next dose of teclistamab and they should remain within the proximity 
of a healthcare facility and be monitored daily for 48 hours after administration. Specific guidelines 
for the management of CRS by severity are provided in the SmPC. Part V.2 of the RMP includes 
an additional risk minimization measure (ie, Patient Card) to further mitigate the risk of CRS.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Cytokine  release  syndrome is  a  known  class  effect  associated  with  T-cell  redirector therapy 
including bispecific antibodies that bind to CD3. While CRS may be life-threatening or fatal, the 
majority of CRS  events  in the clinical trial were  Grade 1 or  Grade  2.  All events of  CRS  were

information  on  the  risk  of  CRS.  A  Patient  Card  is  included  as  an  additional risk  minimization 
measure to further mitigate the risk of CRS. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive for the 
product considering the severity of the proposed indication, the demonstrated efficacy for patients 
treated with teclistamab, and the low grade severity of CRS observed in the clinical trial.
Public Health Impact:

Cytokine release syndrome (Preferred term [PT])
Important Identified Risk: Neurologic toxicity, including ICANS
Potential Mechanisms:
Neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, has been reported with other T-cell redirectors; however, 
the precise mechanism is unclear.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect associated with bispecific T-cell 
redirectors.  Neurologic  toxicity, including  ICANS, has  been  reported  in  subjects treated  with 
teclistamab  in  the  clinical  trial  and  ICANS was  identified  as  an  adverse  reaction.  The  risk  for 
neurologic  toxicity, including  ICANS, and  information  regarding  this  adverse  reaction,  are 
described in the SmPC for teclistamab. 
Based  on  the  known  class  effect  and  the  evidence  from  clinical  trial  data,  neurologic  toxicity,
including ICANS, is considered an important identified risk for teclistamab.
Characterization of the Risk:
As  the  clinical  manifestations  of  neurological  toxicity, including  ICANS, varied  from  nervous 
system disorders  to  psychiatric disorders,  the system organ classes  (SOCs) of  Nervous  System 
Disorders  and  Psychiatric  Disorders  were  used  for  this  important  identified  risk.  However,  the 
major safety concern for teclistamab is ICANS as a class effect associated with bispecific T-cell 
redirectors. One  case  of  reversible  movement  disorder  was  also  reported,  which  could  be  drug 
induced.  Other  neurological  findings  were  non-specific  and  were  consistent  with  neurologic 
toxicity observed with bispecific T-cell redirectors.

Immune  effector  cell-associated  neurotoxicity  syndrome  (ICANS)  was  reported  for  5  subjects 
(3.0%) in Trial MMY1001 (n=165), and the severity was Grade 1 or Grade 2 for all events. The 
median time from last injection of teclistamab to new onset of  ICANS was 4 days (range: 2 to 
5 days) and the median duration of ICANS was 3 days (range: 1 to 20 days). All events of ICANS 
resolved, with none leading to discontinuation or death. 
Grade 3 and higher ICANS events (<1%) were reported in clinical trials with teclistamab alone 
and in  combination  with  other  medicinal  products  (16 March  2023  cutoff  date)  and  from 
postmarketing data (22 February 2023 cutoff date); the median observed time to onset of ICANS 
events (any grade) was 3 days (range: 0 to 21 days) after the most recent dose.
The most frequent clinical manifestations of  ICANS were confusional state,  decreased level of 
consciousness, disorientation, dysgraphia, aphasia, apraxia, and somnolence. 
Of subjects treated at RP2D in Trial MMY1001, 57.6% were reported to have at least 1 event in 
the  Nervous  System  Disorders  or  Psychiatric  Disorders  SOC  (defined  as  neurologic  toxicity,
including ICANS, above); most events were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Thirteen subjects (7.9%) were 
33
TECVAYLI (teclistamab)
Risk Management Plan Version 3.2
20 Sept 2023
reported  to  have  serious  events.  One  subject  had  a  serious  event  of  neurotoxicity  that  was 
considered  related  to  teclistamab  treatment;  preferred  terms  included  cogwheel  rigidity, 
hypokinesia, lethargy, muscle rigidity, tremor, and apathy. These events have either resolved or 
are resolving, and the subject remains on trial at the time of clinical cutoff. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk factors have not been fully identified. Patients with CNS disorders may be at higher risk for 
neurological adverse events.
Preventability:
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, and treated 
promptly. At the first sign of ICANS, patients should be evaluated and treated with consideration 
for neurologic evaluation. Teclistamab should be withheld until resolution of any Grade 1, Grade 
2, or first occurrence of a Grade 3 event of ICANS, and should be permanently discontinued for 
any recurrent Grade 3 or any Grade 4 ICANS event. In the case of any Grade 2 or first occurrence 
of a Grade 3 ICANS event, patients should remain within the proximity of a healthcare facility and 
be  monitored  daily  for  48  hours  after  administration  of  the  next  dose  of  teclistamab.  Specific 
guidelines for the management of ICANS by severity are provided in the SmPC. Part V.2 of the 
RMP includes an additional risk minimization measure (ie, Patient Card) to further mitigate the 
risk of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, is a known class effect associated with T-cell redirector 
therapies. While neurologic toxicities including ICANS may be life threatening or fatal, all ICANS 
events in the teclistamab clinical trial were Grade 1 or Grade 2.
Neurologic  toxicities, including  ICANS, were  effectively  managed  with  available  treatments. 
Detailed  guidance  for  how  to  manage  and  mitigate  ICANS  is  provided  in  the  SmPC  and  PL. 
Follow-up data from Studies MMY1001 and MMY3001 will provide further information on the 
risk  of  neurologic  toxicity, including  ICANS.  A  Patient  Card  is  included  as  an  additional  risk 
minimization measure to further mitigate this risk. Overall, the risk-benefit balance is positive for 
the  product  considering  the severity  of  the  proposed  indication,  the  demonstrated  efficacy  for 
patients treated with teclistamab, and the low-grade severity  of  neurologic toxicities, including 
ICANS, observed in the clinical trial.
Public Health Impact:
All  usage  will  be  well  controlled  by  the  healthcare  professional.  No  public  health  impact  is 
anticipated.

TECVAYLI (teclistamab)
Annex 1 MedDRA Term:
Nervous System Disorders (SOC)
Important Identified Risk: Serious infections
Potential Mechanisms:
Risk Management Plan Version 3.2
20 Sept 2023
Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow disorder of immune system cells (plasma cells) with impaired 
immune function resulting in infection. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is expressed in B cell 
lineage. Teclistamab is expected to reduce B cells which may lead to hypogammaglobulinemia.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have 
been reported for subjects treated with teclistamab in the clinical trial and serious infections such 
as pneumonia and sepsis have been identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for serious infection 
and information regarding this adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for teclistamab. 
Based  on  the  findings from  the  clinical  trial,  serious  infections  are  considered  an  important 
identified risk for teclistamab. Further data are needed to establish whether a causal relationship 
exists. 
Characterization of the Risk:
Note: Although the important identified risk is serious infections, all adverse events identified by 
the SOC of infections and infestations are captured in the following table, independent of their 
seriousness.

At RP2D in Trial MMY1001, infections were considered serious for 40.6% of subjects. The most 
commonly  reported  serious  infections  were  COVID-19  infection  (24  subjects  [14.5%])  and 
pneumonia  (17  subjects  [10.3%]).  Grade  5  infections  were  reported  for  15  subjects  (9.1%),  of 
which  12  died  from  COVID-19, and  1  subject  each  died  from  pneumonia,  pneumonia 
streptococcal, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
There are multiple factors that may increase the  risk of  infectious  complications. Patients with 
multiple  myeloma  are  at  risk  of  infection  due  to  the  overproduction  of  ineffective  monoclonal 
antibodies  from  the  underlying  disease,  which  causes  immune  dysfunction.  Multiple  myeloma 
patients  have  as  much  as  a  15-fold  increase  in  risk  of  infections,  particularly  pneumonia.  In 
addition, the functional status and medical fragility of the patient may be a risk factor. Studies have 
shown that hospitalized patients, those with poor functional status or comorbid conditions, and 
older  adults  are  more  likely  to  develop  infection  complications. Another  risk  factor  is  the 
concomitant use of other immunosuppressive medications with synergistic adverse immunologic 
treatments  (eg,
effects.  The  use  of  multiple  chemotherapy  and 
immunosuppressive 
36
TECVAYLI (teclistamab)

corticosteroids),  and  neutropenia  as  a  complication  of  the  treatments,  increases  the  risk  of 
infection. In  addition,  B-cell  aplasia  and  subsequent  hypogammaglobulinemia  are  on-target, 
off-tumor  toxicities  for  teclistamab,  which  could  result  in  increased  susceptibility  to  infection 
including reactivation of latent hepatitis B infection.
Preventability:
Patients with active infection should not be started on the teclistamab step-up dosing schedule until 
the  infection  resolves.  For  subsequent  dosing (ie,  after  step-up  dosing),  if  patients  develop  an 
infection of Grade 3 or 4, then teclistamab should be withheld until the infection improves to Grade 
2 or better. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during 
treatment with teclistamab and should be treated appropriately. Prophylactic antimicrobials should 
be administered according to local institutional guidelines. Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur 
in  patients  treated  with  medicinal  products  directed  against  B  cells.  Patients  with  evidence  of 
positive HBV serology should be monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation 
while  receiving  teclistamab,  and  for  at  least  6 months  following  the  end  of  treatment. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia  has  been  reported  in  patients  receiving  teclistamab.  Immunoglobulin 
levels should be monitored during teclistamab treatment and hypogammaglobulinemia should be 
treated according to local institutional guidelines.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Serious infections including pneumonia and sepsis have been reported in the teclistamab clinical 
trial.  Teclistamab  is  expected  to  reduce  B cells  which  may  lead  to  hypogammaglobulinemia, 
resulting in the increase of serious infection including HBV reactivation. Multiple myeloma is a 
bone marrow disorder of immune system cells (plasma cells) with impaired immune function, thus 
the incidence of serious infection in this refractory and relapsing population is expected to be high. 
Follow-up data from Studies MMY1001 will provide further information on the risk of serious 
infections. Serious infection also will be monitored in the planned Phase 3 trial (MMY3001) with 
comparators to further evaluate the causality of serious infection with teclistamab. The SmPC and 
PL provide information on how to manage the risk of serious infection. Overall, the risk benefit 
balance is positive for the product considering the severity of the proposed indication, the ability 
to manage infections, and the demonstrated efficacy for patients treated with teclistamab.
Public Health Impact:

received teclistamab for 48 hours after each dose of the step-up 
dosing schedule.
To provide a Patient Card that advises patients to carry it at all 
times and share it with any HCP providing care (including 
emergency) so the patient can be evaluated and treated for CRS 
or neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, in a timely manner.
All patients/carers who are expected to use teclistamab
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the interventions and criteria for 
success:

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for teclistamab
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  TECVAYLI.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of TECVAYLI, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about TECVAYLI’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
TECVAYLI’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TECVAYLI should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for TECVAYLI should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
TECVAYLI’s RMP.
1.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
TECVAYLI is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  and 
refractory  multiple  myeloma  who  have  received  at  least  3  prior  therapies,  including  an 
immunomodulatory  agent,  a  proteasome  inhibitor,  and  an anti-CD38  antibody,  and  have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
teclistamab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of TECVAYLI’s benefits can be found in TECVAYLI’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage.

Important risks of TECVAYLI are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TECVAYLI. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk:  Cytokine release syndrome
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
CRS is a known class effect associated with T-cell redirector
therapy including bispecific antibodies that bind to CD3. CRS has 
been reported in subjects treated in the TECVAYLI clinical trial 
and was identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for CRS and
information regarding this adverse reaction are described in the 
SmPC for TECVAYLI. 
Based on the strength of evidence from the clinical trial data and 
information from the literature, CRS is considered an important 
identified risk for TECVAYLI.

Important Identified Risk:  Neurologic toxicity, including ICANS
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect 
associated with bispecific T-cell redirectors. Neurologic toxicity,
including ICANS, has been reported in subjects treated with 
TECVAYLI in the clinical trial and ICANS was identified as an 
adverse reaction. The risk for neurologic toxicity, including 
ICANS, and information regarding this adverse reaction, are 
described in the SmPC for TECVAYLI. 
Based on the known class effect and the evidence from clinical 
trial data, neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, is considered an 
important identified risk for TECVAYLI.
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk factors have not been fully identified. Patients with CNS 
disorders may be at higher risk for neurological adverse events.

Important Identified Risk:  Serious infections
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, including life-
threatening or fatal infections, have been reported for subjects 
treated with TECVAYLI in the clinical trial and serious infections 
such as pneumonia and sepsis have been identified as an adverse 
reaction. The risk for serious infection and information regarding 
this adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for TECVAYLI. 
Based on the findings from the clinical trial, serious infections are 
considered an important identified risk for TECVAYLI. Further 
data are needed to establish whether a causal relationship exists.
There are multiple factors that may increase the risk of infectious 
complications. Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk of 
infection due to the overproduction of ineffective monoclonal 
antibodies from the underlying disease, which causes immune 
dysfunction. Multiple myeloma patients have as much as a 15-fold 
increase in risk of infections, particularly pneumonia. In addition, 
the functional status and medical fragility of the patient may be a 
risk factor. Studies have shown that hospitalized patients, those 
with poor functional status or comorbid conditions, and older
adults are more likely to develop infection complications. Another 
risk factor is the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive 
medications with synergistic adverse immunologic effects. The use 
of multiple chemotherapy and immunosuppressive treatments (eg, 
corticosteroids), and neutropenia as a complication of the 
treatments, increases the risk of infection. In addition, B-cell 
aplasia and subsequent hypogammaglobulinemia are on-target, 
off-tumor toxicities for TECVAYLI, which could result in 
increased susceptibility to infection including reactivation of latent 
hepatitis B infection.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The absence, or almost complete absence, of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) in Pompe disease patients leads to 
the  accumulation  of  high  levels  of  glycogen  particularly  in  cardiac,  skeletal,  and  respiratory  muscles, 
which leads to generalised myopathy, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. The clinical presentation of 
Pompe  disease  includes  a  range  of  phenotypes  featuring  different  ages  at  onset,  degrees  of  organ 
involvement, and rates of progression. The most severe form of the disease is the classical infantile‐onset 
form, which presents early in life and is mainly characterized by cardiomegaly. Late‐onset Pompe disease 
(LOPD), on the other hand, typically manifests with absence of noticeable cardiomegaly and normally has 
an  age  onset  at  ≥  2  years.  The  aetiology  of  the  classical  infantile‐  and  late‐onset  forms  is  identical; 
however  the  activity  of  the  GAA  enzyme  measured  in  the  blood  differs:  classical  infantile‐onset  Pompe 
disease presents with almost no residual enzyme activity and death occurs within the first 2 years of life. 
LOPD  manifests  in  children  as  well  as  in  juvenile  and  adult  patients.  The  older  age  at  onset,  lack  of 
cardiac  involvement  and  slower  and  heterogeneous  progression  distinguish  LOPD  from  the  classical 
infantile‐onset phenotype. 
In  children,  juveniles,  and  adults  with  LOPD,  disease  severity  increases  with  disease  duration.  As  the 
disease progresses, the symptoms become more evident, with increasing proximal muscle weakness and 
respiratory  insufficiency  being  the  most  common  signs.  The  resulting  difficulties  in  motor  functions  and 
respiratory distress lead to increased wheelchair dependency and requirement for ventilation support. In 
addition,  earlier  onset  of  disease  among  children  leads  to  a  more  severe  and  more  rapidly  progressive 
disease.  Life  expectancy  in  LOPD  patients  varies:  in  patients  with  the  juvenile  phenotype,  death  often 
occurs before the end of the third decade. In adult‐onset LOPD patients, the mortality rates were higher 
compared  with  the  general  population  and  the  level  of  disability  and  handicap  most  heavily  influenced 
mortality. In general, respiratory failure is often the main cause of death in patients with LOPD. 
Myozyme is a recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA), which aims to restore lysosomal GAA 
activity  resulting  in  stabilisation  or  restoration  of  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle  (including  muscles  of  the 
respiratory system). On 29 March 2006 the European Commission granted a Marketing Authorisation for 
Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa, EU/1/06/333/001-003) for patients of all ages with a confirmed diagnosis of 
Pompe  disease  (acid  α-glucosidase  deficiency).  The  indication  section  of  the  SmPC  also  stated  that  the 
benefits of Myozyme in patients with late-onset Pompe disease have not been established. Subsequently, 
in  2009,  this  statement  was  amended  via  variation  to  the  MA  to  inform  the  prescriber  that  in  patients 
with late-onset Pompe disease the evidence of efficacy is limited.

In the current variation, the MAH proposed to update section 5.1 of the SmPC with the efficacy and safety 
information in late-onset Pompe patients. Consequently, a deletion of the above discussed sentence from 
section  4.1  that  the  evidence  of  efficacy  is  limited  in  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease  was 
proposed.  
The application is based on the results of: 
Two observational studies about evolution of severe late-onset disease patients treated by Myozyme: 
-  Clinical Study Report (Pompe Phys 01 and 02) based on the analysis of interim data collected in the 
ongoing  follow-up  studies “Effects  and  Health  Economic  Aspects  of  Enzyme  Therapy  in  Children  and 
Adults  with  Pompe  Disease”  (Phys  02)  and  “Natural  course,  disease  severity and  supportive  care  in 
non-classic Pompe’s disease (Phys 01)”  
-  Clinical  study  Report  AGLU  4107:  Observational  study  about  the  evolution  of  severe  late-onset 
disease patients with pulmonary dysfunction and Myozyme.  
A post-hoc analysis on ventilation data from study AGLU02704: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, 
Multinational,  Placebo-Controlled  Study  of  The  Safety,  Efficacy,  And  Pharmacokinetics  of  Myozyme, 
Recombinant  Human  Acid  Alpha-Glucosidase  (rhGAA),  Treatment  in  Patients  With  Late-Onset  Pompe 
Disease. 
Supportive data consisted of: 
- a manuscript for publication by D. Güngör (2012): Impact of enzyme replacement therapy on survival in 
adults with Pompe’s disease: results from a prospective international observational study; 
-  a  publication  by  Regnery  (2012):  36  months  observational  clinical  study  of  38  adult  Pompe  disease 
patients under alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (Regnery et al, J Inherit Metab Dis 2012); 
-  a  publication  by  Angelini  (2011):  Observational  clinical  study  in  juvenile-adult  glycogenosis  type  2 
patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy for up to 4 years (Angelini et al J Neurol 2011);  
-  a  systematic  review  of  clinical  outcomes  of  alglucosidase  alfa  in  the  treatment  of  late-onset  Pompe 
Disease. 
-  a  literature  analysis  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  outcome  measures  used  in  Pompe  Disease.

2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Evaluation criteria for Pompe Disease  
  Muscle strength 
Medical Research Council Score (MRC) 
Muscle strength was determined by Manual Muscle Testing using the MRC grading scale. Muscle strength 
was graded from 0 to 5 by physical examination, in which grade 5 represents normal muscle strength and 
grade  0  paralysis  of  the  muscle  group  tested.  Twenty-six  muscle  groups  were  tested  (neck  extensors, 
neck  flexors,  bilateral  shoulder  abductors,  shoulder  adductors,  elbow  flexors,  elbow  extensors,  hip 
flexors,  hip  abductors,  hip  extensors,  and  hip  adductors,  knee  flexors,  and  knee  extensors,  exorotators 
and endorotators). An MRC sum score was derived by adding the grades for all the 26 muscle groups and 
expressing the sum as a percentage of the maximum possible score. If values for three or more muscle 
groups were missing, no sums cores were calculated. 
Hand-held Dynamometry (HHD) 
Assessment report  
Myozyme 
Page 4/18 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A quantitative muscle testing was also used  to determine muscle strength. Sixteen muscle  groups were 
tested  (neck  extensors,  neck  flexors,  bilateral  shoulder  abductors,  elbow  flexors,  elbow  extensors,  hip 
flexors,  hip  abductors,  knee  flexors,  and  knee  extensors).  The  individual  HHD  values  of  each  muscle 
group were first expressed as a percentage of normal strength using as a cut-off the median strength of 
healthy adults individuals based on gender. The HHD sum score is calculated as the average percentage 
of all the 16 muscle groups. 
Manual muscle testing (MMT) 
The MMT is an evaluation of muscle strength to determine the ability of a muscle or group of muscles, to 
perform a movement and to ensure stability and strength.  
Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) 
QMT is designed to measure muscle strength developed during isometric contraction and assesses muscle 
weakness in patients with neuromuscular disorders.  
  Muscle function 
Quick Motor Function Test [QMFT] 
To  evaluate  the  function  of  the  muscle  groups  that  are  specifically  affected  in  patients  with  Pompe 
disease,  a  16-item  functional  test  has  been  developed  (QMFT).  The  patient  is  asked  to  perform  several 
activities related to daily activities in supine, sitting and standing position. These activities require the use 
of muscles of the shoulder girdle, trunk, pelvic girdle and/or proximal lower  limbs. Each item was scored 
on  a  5-point  ordinal  scale,  with  0  representing  ‘cannot  per-form  task’  and  4  ‘can  perform  task  with  no 
effort’.  Adding  all  items  gives  a  total  score  between  0  and  64.  The  actual  sum  score  is  expressed  as  a 
percentage of the maximum score. 
Walton & Gardner-Medwin (WGM) scale  
The  Walton  scale  is  a  generic  clinical  evaluation  tool  used  to  evaluate  a  change  in  functional  state  and 
was adapted to produce an 11-point ordinal scale. The scale essentially evaluates weakness. 
Brooke and Vignos test 
Arm  function  evaluation  test  (Brooke):  Patients  were  to  hold  their  arms  out  straight,  the  palms  of  the 
hands facing one another. One of the arm function scores featuring is awarded according to the maximum 
activity they were capable of accomplishing. 
Leg function evaluation test (Vignos): The Vignos test evaluates leg function. Patients should be able to 
perform actions and a score is allocated according to maximum activity they were able to accomplish.  
Motor function measurement (MFM) scale 
This clinical tool is used to measure the motor possibilities of patients with neuromuscular diseases such 
as  Pompe  disease.  Three  dimensions  are  explored,  regrouping  the  items  in  sub-groups  during 
measurements carried out in the standing, sitting and supine positions.  
10-metre walking test 
For this test, the patient has to prepare to  walk a distance  of 10 metres (30 feet) in a corridor or on a 
walkway. The distance is timed from the moment the patient began to walk until the 10- metre walk was 
complete. 
Climbing stairs 
The evaluation covered climbing of four standard steps. For this test, the patient is to stand at the foot of 
the central part of the first step, then climb four stairs without holding onto the handrail; they were then 
to stop and stand with their arms by their side. 
Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) 
This test measures the distance patients can walk at their own pace along a flat, hard surface in a period 
of 6 minutes. 
 
Pulmonary function 
Forced vital capacity (FVC)  
This  was  a  measure  of  respiratory  muscle  weakness  and  the  strength  of  the  diaphragm  according  to 
ATS/ERS standards. Patients were tested in upright seated and supine position.

Three repeated flow volume curves are made and the maximum value of the three reproducible tests was 
used for analysis. Results were expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal value. 
Dyspnoea Borg scale 
The Borg scale is the combination of a scale of verbal categories and a numeric scale. This scale is used 
to  measure  the  effort  during  an  exercise  by  a  scale  easily  understood  by  the  subjects  and  enabling 
comparison between individuals. 
Dyspnoea VAS 
Dyspnoea is measured by the patient themselves using an analogue scale. The subject is to evaluate the 
intensity  of  their  dyspnoea  by  indicating  a  point  on  the  line,  from  0-  10,  after  20  minutes  without 
ventilation. 
Maximum static pressure: Pimax and Pemax 
Maximal inspiratory static pressure (Pimax) and expiratory (Pemax) pressure produced by a subject are 
clues to evaluating the inspiratory and expiratory strength of the respiratory muscles. 
Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) 
Transdiaphragmatic  pressure  (Pdi)  is  defined  as  the  difference  between  pleural  pressure  (Ppl)  and 
abdominal  pressure  (Pab)  and,  in  practice,  is  generally  measured  as  the  difference  between  gastric 
pressure  (Pga)  and  oesophageal  pressure  (Poes).  It  makes  it  possible  to  assess  the  quality  of  the 
mechanical  coupling  between  the diaphragm  and  the  passive  respiratory  system  and  to titer inspiratory 
assistance. 
Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) with cervical magnetic stimulation 
Magnetic  stimulation  of  the  cervical  spine  produces  bilateral  contraction  of  the  diaphragm.  The  reel  is 
centred above the spine of vertebra of the 7th cervical vertebra. Cervical magnetic stimulation stimulates 
nerve elements, leading to the contraction of various neck muscles and of the upper chest, and this in a 
concomitant manner to contraction of the diaphragm.  
  Quality of life 
Fatigue severity scale (FSS) 
The  FSS  is  a  self-administered  questionnaire  and  comprises  9  answers  for  evaluating  the  severity  of 
fatigue  felt  when  carrying  out  daily  activities.  The  FSS  is  based on  a  score  from  1-7;  1  means that  the 
subject  totally  disagrees  with  the  proposal  and  7  which  means  they  totally  agree  with  the  proposal. 
Clinical improvement in fatigue is shown by a reduction in the total FSS score. 
SF-36 quality of life scale 
The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) is a self-questionnaire for evaluating the quality of life relating to 
the state of health of healthy or sick adult subjects. It contains 36 items organised into 8 areas evaluating 
physical activity, limitations due to physical condition, physical pain, and mental health, limitations due to 
mental  condition,  social  activity,  vitality  and  general  state  of  health.  The  SF-36  also  contains  two 
summary measures of physical health and a mental health component derived from scale aggregates. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Main results 
The  two  main  outcome  measures  used  in  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease  are  the  6-minutes 
walking  test  (6  MWT)  and  the  percentage  of  predicted  forced  vital  capacity  (%  predicted  FVC)  as  they 
reflect altered muscle function and pulmonary capacity. The MAH made a literature analysis to determine 
the  clinical  relevance  of  6MWT  and  FVC  in  patients  with  compromised  physical  functional  capacity,  and 
apply  these  findings  to  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease.  Overall,  19  publications  discussed  the 
clinical  relevance  of  absolute  changes  and  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  6  MWT  results.  In  the 
different studies, a change of 25 to 50 m (representing 10 to 15% change from baseline) represented a 
clinically  relevant  effect  for  the  patient.  In  patients  with  chronic  lung  disease,  a  10%  improvement  or 
decline  from  absolute  FVC  values  at  baseline  has  been  identified  as  the  level  of  change  required  to 
indicate  valid  variation  in  disease  severity  as  opposed  to  measurement  fluctuation  for  lung  disease 
(ATS/ERS guidelines 2002).  
The CHMP noted that due to the lack of published data in Pompe disease, this estimation was made using 
data  in  other  diseases  (e.g.  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  and  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis).

These  extrapolations  may  be  flawed  considering  that  comparator  diseases  used  in  this  analysis  are 
characterized by respiratory components only, while Pompe disease has both respiratory/diaphragm and 
skeletal muscle components of pathophysiology. 
6 MWT 
The 6MWT has been assessed in two published observational studies: Angelini 2011 and Regnery 2012. 
In Angelini 2011, the 6 MWT was assessed in 58 patients: it increased in average 63 m (19 % from the 
baseline). In Regnery 2012, the 6 MWT was assessed in 21 patients: it increased in average 32 m (10 % 
from  the  baseline)  at  M12,  was  stable  at  M24  and  decreased  between  M24  and  M36  in  average  39  m 
(8%). 
FVC % 
The  FVC  was  assessed  in  the  PHYS  01-02  and  AGLU  04107  studies  and  in  Regnery  2012  and  Angelini 
2011  publications.  In  the  PHYS  01-02  study,  FVC  in  upright  position  evaluated  in  46  patients  remained 
stable  (+  0.1%  per  year;  p=0.92)  and  the  FCV  in  decline  position  evaluated  in  42  patients  declined  (-
1.1% per year ; p=0.03). 
In the AGLU 04107 study, due to the low initial Vital Capacity values in the 8 studied patients, FVC was 
not measured, only Slow Vital Capacity was measured. The SVC (as percentage of the theoretical values) 
in upright position between D0 and M24 decreased in average -4.63+10.58 and the SVC (as percentage 
of the theoretical values) in supine position between D0 and M24 increased in average 1.13+4.16. 
In  Angelini  2011,  the  mean  FVC%  was  performed  for  69  patients  and  remained  stable  (65.2+26.5  to 
66.5+26.6 p=0.22) during treatment. In Regnery 2012, the mean FVC% was performed for 28 patients. 
After 36 months, the result was a mean decrease of 3.08% of FVC% (p=ns)  
Supportive results 
Muscle strength 
MRC  
In  PHYS  01-02,  MRC  increased  in  average  1.4%  (95%CI  0.8  to  2.1)  per  year  during  ERT  (N=69);  p  < 
0.001 in the overall population. In patients with pre-ERT and ERT data (N=49), MRC rose by an average 
of 2.1% (95%CI 1.2 to 3.0)  per year during ERT while declined by 1.2 % (95%CI -2.1 to 0.4) per year 
before  ERT.  In  Regnery  2012,  the  mean  MRC  sum  score  remained  stable  from  42.29±8.49  at baseline, 
41.92± 8.62 at M12, 43.89±5.16 at M24, and 41.19±7.61 after M 36 of ERT (all p = n.s.) 
HHD  
In  PHYS  01-02,  HHD  increased  in  average  4.0%  (95%CI  2.5  to  5.6)  per  year  during  ERT  (N=64);  p  < 
0.001 in the overall population and rose by an average of 5.1% (95%CI 2.5 to 5.6) per year during ERT 
in  patients  with  pre-ET  and  ERT  data  (N=42)  while  declined  by  4.8  %  (95%CI  -4.2  to  -1.3)  per  year 
before ERT. 
Quick Motor Function Test [QMFT] 
In  PHYS  01-02,  QMFT  increase  in  average  0.7%  per  year  during  ERT  (N=69  -  NS);  p=0.14.  No 
comparison with pre-treatment data was performed. 
Walton & Gardner-Medwin (WGM) Brooke and Vignos scale  
In AGLU 04107 (N=7) a one point improvement was observed in 2 patients and remained unchanged in 5 
patients. In Angelini 2011 (N=68) the score remained unchanged during treatment. In Regnery 2012 (N= 
38) the mean WGMS at base line was 4.45 +2.1 and remained stable. 
Motor function measurement (MFM) scale 
In AGLU 04107 (N=7) the scale increased from 4 to 8% in 5 patients, remained stable in 1 patient and 
decreased by 2% in 1 patient. 
10-metre walking test 
In  AGLU  04107  (N=5)  at  24  months,  2  patients  improved  their  performance  (3  and  1  seconds)  and  2 
reduced  their  performance  (2  and  6  seconds).  Another  patient  improved  his  performance  (4  seconds) 
between D0 and M12.

In  AGLU  04107  (N=4),  24  months,  2  patients  improved  their  performance  (1  and  4  seconds)  and  2 
reduced their performance (1 and 6 seconds). 
Fatigue severity scale (FSS) 
In AGLU 04107 (N=7), at M 24 fatigue had reduced in 5 patients (from -4% to -20%). 
SF-36 quality of life scale 
In  AGLU  04107  (N=8)  at  M12  (3  patients)  or  M24  (5  patients),  the  overall  physical  component  score 
improved  by  0.9  to  11.9  points,  mildly  decreased  for  2  patients  (0.5  and  2.1  points  respectively)  and 
significantly  reduced  for  1  patient  by  18.9.  In  Regnery  2012,  SF-36  did  not  change  on  a  group  or 
individual basis from baseline to month 36 of ERT (all p = n.s.). 
Dyspnoea Borg scale 
In AGLU 04107, the mean score remained stable in the sitting position (N=7), but gained 2 points in the 
supine  position  (N=6),  improving  from  a  “severe”  degree  of  dyspnoea  (Borg  score  5)  at  D0  to  a 
“moderate” degree of dyspnoea (Borg score 3) at M24.  
Time without assisted ventilation 
In AGLU  04107, among patients in invasive  assisted  ventilation, 3 decreased their ventilation time by 1 
hour between D0 and M24 (24hrs to 23hrs and 12hrs to 11hrs) and 1 stayed stable (24hrs/24). Among 
the  5  patients  in  non-invasive  assisted  ventilation,  1  reduced  his  ventilation  time  by  1  hour,  1  stayed 
stable  and  2  increased  their  ventilation  time  (15  minutes  and  2hrs).  In  AGLU02704,  after  78  weeks  of 
treatment,  in  patients  who  reported  the  use  of  NIV  at  baseline,  the  mean  number  of  hours  per  day  of 
treatment, the mean number of hours on NIV per day increased in both groups; by 0.27 ± 2 hours in the 
Myozyme treatment group (N=20) and 1.3 ± 2 hours in the placebo group (N=11) (p=0.0474).

The  publications  contained  data  on  298  LOPD  patients  who  were  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa.  The 
majority of the patients (55%) received treatment with alglucosidase alfa for a period of 12–23 months, 
28% for a period > 36 months, 12% for 24–35 months, and 5% patients were treated for < 12 months. 
Motor performance and ambulation status in LOPD patients treated with alglucosidase alfa  
Eleven studies (104 patients) reported changes in motor performance in LOPD patients during treatment, 
as  assessed  using  the  6MWT.  Change  in  motor  performance  in  LOPD  patients  during  treatment  with 
alglucosidase alfa as assessed using the 6 MWT: 
Blue and green lines represented studies in treated patients: Blue lines in studies with >10 patients, green lines in 
studies with <10 patients. Red line represents the placebo (untreated) population. Data from Angelini 2011 are 
presented in separate groups corresponding to 3 different durations of treatment. Some overlap exists between 
patients in the Strothotte and Regnery studies. The Regnery publication reports on data from the same cohort of 
patients as the Strothotte trial, but after a longer follow-up. 
Respiratory  status  and  ventilation  support  in  late-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  treated  with 
alglucosidase alfa  
The literature search identified 18 studies reporting on the change in respiratory status and/or ventilation 
support in LOPD patients treated. Of these, 11 studies, including a total of 242 LOPD patients, reported 
on  FVC  outcomes.  Individual  changes  in  FVC  were  reported  for  126  patients  from  8  studies.  Following 
treatment, 64 (51%) of these patients showed an increase in % FVC, 17 (13%) stabilized, and 45 (36%) 
Assessment report

experienced  a  decrease.  Change  in  respiratory  status  in  LOPD  patients  during  treatment  with 
alglucosidase alfa as assessed using the % FVC is summarised as follows: 
Data on changes in requirement for ventilation support following treatment were available for 69 patients 
from 11 studies including 171 LOPD patients. Following treatment with alglucosidase alfa, 38/69 (55%) of 
these patients experienced a decrease in the number of hours  of  ventilation required/day, 15/69 (22%) 
stabilized, and 1/69 (1%) required longer duration of ventilation. A total of 4 patients (6%) required de 
novo ventilation. 
Quality of life QoL in late-onset Pompe disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa  
QoL was evaluated in 9 studies including 182/298 patients who received alglucosidase alfa.  At baseline, 
QoL  scores  were  below  the  norms  for  the  US  general  population  in  144/182  (79%)  patients.  Following 
treatment,  most  patients  (n  =  104)  did  not  report  any  changes  in  QoL.  A  total  of  12  (8%)  patients 
reported  an  overall  increase  in  QoL  scores:  4  patients  showed  an  increase  in  the  physical  component 
score, 5 patients reported an increase in the mental component score, and 4 patients had decreased body 
pain.  For  some  patients,  improvements  in  outcomes  following  treatment  had  a  positive,  if  less 
quantifiable,  impact  on  their  QoL:  a  subjective  improvement  in  endurance  and  QoL  was  reported  by  1 
patient after a follow-up of 3.8 years, and in another study, patients showing increased muscle strength 
and  function  reported  improved  ability  to  participate  in  outdoor  activities.  Two  patients  experienced  a 
decrease  in  QoL:  1  reported  decreasing  physical  component  score  and  the  other  patient  showed  a 
decrease in the mental component score and an increase in the fatigue severity scores. 
2.2.3.  Discussion 
The data submitted by the MAH originate from observational studies with the median observational time 
between  78  weeks  (1.5  years)  and  2  years.  The  CHMP  noted  some  limitations,  e.g.  the  number  of 
patients  is  limited  and  no  comparator  has  been  used.  In  the  survival  study,  it  appears  that  there  is  a 
difference  between  the  two  groups  (treated  and  untreated)  in  terms  of  severity:  more  patients  with 
Assessment report  
Myozyme 
Page 15/18 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ventilation support or wheelchair dependency in untreated arm (66% versus 56%). The CHMP considered 
that  the calculations of the  transposition of life years  were  confined  and  thus,  the results of the  studies 
can be considered as exploratory, without a precise definition of the effect of the treatment on survival. 
The 6 MWT and FVC % were the relevant evaluation criteria and were assessed in two studies showing a 
gain  of  32  and  63  meters  respectively,  within  70  %  of  evaluated  patients.  The  sitting  FVC  %  was 
assessed in 3 studies and no difference was observed before and after treatment. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  submitted  data  were  of  observational  character  and  unlikely  to 
demonstrate unambiguous clinical relevance of Myozyme treatment in patient with LOPD. Therefore, the 
MAH was requested to provide further data to support the current variation to update the PI of Myozyme 
with  data  on  patients  with  LOPD.  These  should  include  convincing  data  showing  a  treatment  effect  on 
survival or at least demonstrating a significant clinical improvement in respiratory and/or muscle function. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  submit  the  analysis  of  determination  of  the  clinical  relevance  of 
outcomes in  LOPD  patients,  since  the  size  effect  and  its  relevance  were  assessed  from  other  conditions 
and not from LOPD patients.  
In response to the CHMP’s concerns, the MAH provided further justification of the scientific robustness of 
the  Survival  analysis  and  asked  independent  statistical  experts  to  comment  on  the  value  of  using  the 
International Pompe Association/Erasmus MC (IPA/EMC) survey and the statistical analysis methods used. 
The  IPA/EMC  survey  was  believed  to  be  of  high  quality  as  it  was  prospectively  planned  and  specific  to 
late-onset  Pompe  patients.  The  survival  coefficients from  the  different  models  can  be  interpreted in  the 
way described in the publication and included in the current variation. 
The CHMP also commented on the appeared population difference. The MAH argued that the authors used 
epidemiological  methods  in  order  to  attempt  to  control  for  potential  bias.  Throughout  the  published 
paper,  the  researchers  used  epidemiological  methods,  which  are  specifically  designed  to  attempt  to 
control for bias in observational data, to assess the impact of treatment on survival. In this progressive 
disease, the authors controlled for covariates that increase the risk of death (age and disease severity) or 
might  present  other  confounding  factors  such  as  gender  and  country  of  residence.  They  also  used  ERT 
treatment  as  a  time  dependent  variable  in  order  to  assess  the  actual  time  on  treatment  and  its  effect. 
This was considered reassuring.  
The MAH agreed with the CHMP that  because of the time-dependent nature of the survival analysis it is 
not possible to estimate the additional years of life gained under ERT as the study authors have stated. 
The ad  hoc calculation of life years gained  was exploratory in nature and based on the assumption that 
the  adjusted  hazard  ratio  can  be  interpreted  as  a  relative  risk  over  the  4  years  median  and  8  years 
maximum  follow-up  (from  start  of  treatment).  The  MAH  further  argued  that  the  assessment  of  the 
outcomes reflected clinical practise. In the period prior to start of therapy the number of patients in the 
ERT  group  requiring  no  wheelchair  or  ventilation  decreases  from  49%  to  34%,  while  the  number  of 
patients  requiring  both  a  wheelchair  and  ventilation  increases  from  24  to  33%  from  study  entry  to  the 
start of ERT.  
The  MAH  also  provided  further  review  and  analyses  of  clinical  efficacy  data  from  published  literature, 
which also support the use of Myozyme in patients with LOPD. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  above  evidence  of  efficacy  of  Myozyme  in  the  treatment  of  LOPD  and 
acknowledged  that  the  conduct  of  multiple  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies  with  solid  endpoints 
would  be  extremely  challenging,  given  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  patient 
population.  It  is  agreed  that  in  each  study  the  majority  of  patients  showed  benefits,  i.e.  moderate 
improvement  or  status  quo  rather  than  decline,  and  the  consistent  trend  across  studies  is  reassuring. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that there is sufficient evidence of efficacy to support addition of the clinical 
results in section 5.1 and to consequently update section 4.1 of Myozyme SmPC, as stated below. 
2.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), which the CHMP  reviewed and 
requested further modifications. The final agreed wording is as follows: 
SmPC, section 4.1, Therapeutic indication: 
Myozyme  is  indicated  for  long-term  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  in  patients  with  a  confirmed 
diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid -glucosidase deficiency).  
Assessment report  
Myozyme 
Page 16/18 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Myozyme is indicated in adults and paediatric patients of all ages.  
In patients with late-onset Pompe disease the evidence of efficacy is limited (see section 5.1). 
SmPC, section 5.1:  
Late-onset Pompe disease; other clinical trials and analyses 
Three independent, open-label, single arm, investigator-initiated studies with Myozyme were conducted: 
  One study in Italy enrolled 74 late-onset patients with up to 48 months follow up. 
  One study in Germany enrolled 38 late-onset patients with 36 months follow up. 
  One study in the Netherlands enrolled 69 late-onset patients with a median follow-up of 23 
months.  
These three studies with Myozyme (with a follow up of at least 3 years in two studies and a median of 23 
months in the other study) suggested stabilisation or improvement of motor function and stabilisation of 
pulmonary function. 
In the above described study in 69 late-onset patients in the Netherlands, Myozyme showed an 
improvement in muscle strength. However, muscle function only improved in wheelchair independent 
patients and in those with less pronounced muscle weakness. 
In two additional open-label clinical trials with Myozyme with a follow-up of 24 months, ten patients with 
severe late-onset Pompe disease (moderate to severe motor impairment and assisted ventilation) showed 
a variable response on measures of motor and respiratory functions, mostly in the form of a modest 
improvement (AGLU03105, AGLU04107). 
PIL, section 1, What Myozyme is and what it is used for 
Myozyme is used to treat adults, children and adolescents of all ages who have a confirmed diagnosis of 
Pompe disease. 
People with Pompe disease have low levels of an enzyme called alfa-glucosidase. This enzyme helps the 
body control levels of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate). Glycogen provides the body with energy, but in 
Pompe disease the levels of glycogen can get too high. 
Myozyme contains an artificial enzyme called alglucosidase alfa – this can replace the natural enzyme 
which is lacking in Pompe disease. 
In patients with late-onset Pompe disease (typically a more slowly progressive form of Pompe disease 
with onset of symptoms after infancy) the evidence of efficacy is limited. 
Several small linguistic corrections were proposed for product information annexes of certain languages. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed 
and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in  the  PL has been revised to amend contact  details for the 
representatives of BE, BG, DK, DE, HR, IS, FI, MT, CY, EL NO, PL and SE. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Data  provided  by  the  MAH  are  based  on  five  observational  studies  evaluating  motor  and  respiratory 
functions of LOPD patients treated by ERT and one observational study evaluating the impact of ERT on 
survival  in  adult  with  LOPD.  Overall,  the  new  observational  clinical  data  present  a  clinically  relevant 
efficacy  trend  in  the  treatment  effect  of  Myozyme  on  overall  survival,  motor  functions  and  respiratory 
status  in  patients  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease.  The  update  of  section  5.1  and  consequently  that  of 
section 4.1 is warranted. The benefit/risk of Myozyme remains unchanged.

Update  of  sections  4.1  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  include  relevant  clinical  data  from  several 
clinical trials and from other analyses of late-onset Pompe disease patients treated with Myozyme. The 
Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  update  the  list  of  local  representatives  in  the  Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. 
The  requested variation proposed amendments to the  Summary  of Product Characteristics, Annex  II,

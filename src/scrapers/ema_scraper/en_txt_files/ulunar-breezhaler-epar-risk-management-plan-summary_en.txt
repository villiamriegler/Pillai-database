Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan
Summary of risk management plan for Ulunar
Breezhaler (Indacaterol/glycopyrronium)
This is a summary of the RMP for Ulunar Breezhaler. The RMP details important 
risks of Ulunar Breezhaler, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Ulunar Breezhaler's risks and uncertainties 
(missing information).
Ulunar Breezhaler’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package 
leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Ulunar Breezhaler should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ulunar Breezhaler should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Ulunar Breezhaler's RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Ulunar Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve 
symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains indacaterol and glycopyrronium as active 
substance and it is given by inhalation of the content of one capsule once-daily using 
Ulunar Breezhaler inhaler. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ulunar Breezhaler's benefits can be found 
in Ulunar Breezhaler's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on 
the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Ulunar Breezhaler, together with measures to minimize such risks 
and the proposed studies for learning more about Ulunar’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
 Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Ulunar are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Ulunar. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Ischemic heart disease
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Current evidence is based on class effect information, literature (Salpeter 
2004, Cazzola et al 2005), pre-clinical investigations, clinical studies and 
PMS data showing some evidence of causal relationship which is 
strengthened by mechanistic studies and MoA.

Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization
Study short name
Purpose of the study:
PASS of indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
in Europe - study CQVA149A2402
The purpose of this PASS is to assess the risk of various RMP-specified 
endpoints in a broader, real-world COPD population.
Objectives:
To assess the incidence rates and relative risks (expressed as Hazard 
Ratios) of various adverse events among patients with a diagnosis of 
COPD initiating inhaled QVA149 compared to patients with a diagnosis of 
COPD initiating comparator medications (single constituent LABA, single 
constituent LAMA, free combination of LAMA/LABA, LABA/inhaled 
corticosteroids [ICS], or LAMA/LABA/ICS or fixed dose combination of 
LABA+ICS with or without LAMA or fixed combination of LAMA/LABA 
(other than QVA149)) with COPD.

There are no studies required for Ulunar.

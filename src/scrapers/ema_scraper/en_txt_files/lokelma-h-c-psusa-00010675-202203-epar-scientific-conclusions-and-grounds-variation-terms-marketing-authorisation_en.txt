Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available case reports including cases with gastrointestinal perforations, the PRAC agrees with 
the MAH’s proposal to correct information that intestinal perforations have been reported with potassium 
binders including Lokelma. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sodium zirconium cyclosilicate the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

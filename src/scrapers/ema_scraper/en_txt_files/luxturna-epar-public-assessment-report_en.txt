2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2 and Retinitis pigmentosa are diagnosed in patients with 
photoreceptor degeneration and who retain central vision within the first decade of life yet with 
subsequent progression of the disease resulting in profound vision loss during the teenage years. 
Associated with both clinical diagnoses, there is a reduced or non-detectable electroretinogram as well 
as attenuated retinal blood vessels and varying amounts of pigmentary deposits within the retina in 
later stages of the disease process. 
It is now considered that the term ‘inherited retinal dystrophy due to biallelic RPE 65 mutations’ 
includes / covers all the patients who were previously identified by more than 20-25 different names 
including Leber's congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa. It is considered that this is ‘genetic 
definition of a condition’ which covers certain (RPE 65 mutation) sub-groups of ‘different phenotypic 
conditions (previously used in the literature)’. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Leber’s congenital amaurosis is estimated to affect about 1 in 80,000 individuals in the EU. 19 different 
genes have been identified as causing Leber's congenital amaurosis, about 10% cases are caused by a 
defect in the RPE65 gene (Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2). 
Retinitis pigmentosa is estimated to affect about 1 in 4,000 individuals. It is estimated that up to 3% 
of all patients with Retinitis pigmentosa have underlying genetic mutations in the RPE65 gene. 
At present, pathogenic variants in 17 genes have been identified as causing Leber's congenital 
amaurosis and account for about half of all cases of Leber's congenital amaurosis. Leber's congenital 
amaurosis type 2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Visual perception results from the biological conversion of light energy to electrical signalling by retinal 
photoreceptors in the eye. The biochemistry involves consumption and regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, a 
derivative of vitamin A. One of the enzymes involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal is all-trans-
retinyl isomerase also known as the retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein [RPE65] encoded by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 9/97 
 
  
 
RPE65 gene. Subjects are unable to regenerate intra-ocular 11-cis-retinal leading to a profound 
impairment in the detection of light. 
Genetic testing has led to a re-evaluation of how patients are diagnosed. Most subjects with bi-allelic 
RPE65 mutations carry a diagnosis of Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2. A retrospective clinical case 
review conducted by the applicant (Study NHx), however, has shown that patients with underlying 
RPE65 mutations may also be diagnosed as: severe early childhood onset retinal dystrophy (SECORD), 
tapetal retinal dystrophy-LCA type, delayed retinal maturation and Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Symptoms of Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2 become evident from 2 – 3 months of age. There is 
progressive, profound reduction of visual acuity, concentric reduction of visual fields, night blindness 
and nystagmus. Subjects have great difficulty performing activities of daily living, even under normal 
daytime lighting conditions. Subjects will be blind by young adulthood. 
Retinitis pigmentosa has a more variable onset and slower progression; symptoms usually begin from 
age 10 years; subjects tend to have better preservation of visual function compared to those with a 
clinical diagnosis of Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2. 
Whilst each subject may express their own age of onset and rate of progression of vision loss, the 
underlying cause remains the same i.e. biochemical blockade of the visual cycle resulting from RPE65 
enzyme deficiency. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is not a licenced medicinal product for these conditions. Treatment is generally supportive; 
affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error and use of low-vision aids. 
Surgical devices are available for some subjects who meet clinical requirements: either the Argus® II 
Retinal Prosthesis System or the Alpha AMS Retina Implant AG. The devices have variable and limited 
clinical efficacy. Consequently, there is an unmet clinical need for these conditions. 
About the product 
AAV2-hRPE65v2 (voretigene neparvovec) is an adeno-associated viral type 2 (AAV2) gene therapy 
vector with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and chicken beta actin promoter driving expression of 
normal human retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (hRPE65) gene. 
The parent adeno-associated serotype 2 virus, used as a template for the vector, is a non-pathogenic, 
single-stranded DNA genome-containing, helper virus-dependent member of the parvovirus family 
Expression of the gene product of hRPE65, all-trans-retinyl isomerase, in subjects with Leber's 
congenital amaurosis and who are recipients of Luxturna, will permit these subjects to regenerate 
intra-ocular 11-cis-retinal and so lead to improvement in the ability to detect light. 
Luxturna is presented in cartons containing 1 vial of concentrate and 2 vials of solvent and is for single 
use only. The product is intended to be applied by an experienced surgeon to the sub-retinal space of 
each eye.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate and solvent for solution for injection containing 5 x 
1012 vector genomes/ml of voretigene neparvovec as active substance.  
Voretigene neparvovec is a gene transfer vector that employs an adeno-associated viral vector 
serotype 2 (AAV2) capsid as a delivery vehicle for the human retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa 
protein (hRPE65) cDNA to the retina. Voretigene neparvovec is derived from naturally occurring AAV 
using recombinant DNA techniques. 
Other ingredients are sodium chloride, sodium phosphate and poloxamer 188 for the concentrate and 
sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, poloxamer 188 and water for injections for the solvent. 
The concentrate is available as 0.5 ml extractable volume of concentrate in a 2 ml cyclic olefin polymer 
vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper sealed in place with an aluminium flip-off seal. 
The solvent is available as 1.7 ml extractable volume of solvent in a 2 ml cyclic olefin polymer vial with 
a chlorobutyl rubber stopper sealed in place with an aluminium flip-off seal. 
Each foil pouch includes a carton containing 1 vial of concentrate and 2 vials of solvent.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Voretigene neparvovec (AAV2-hRPE65v2) is derived from the naturally-occurring adeno-associated 
virus serotype 2 (AAV2), which is ubiquitous in the environment and has not been associated with 
human disease. It is naturally replication deficient, requiring co-infection with helper viruses to 
replicate. The wild-type virus consists of a single-stranded DNA genome encapsidated in a protein coat. 
The genome consists of three elements: the rep gene, the cap gene, and the inverted terminal repeats 
(ITRs). The rep gene codes for proteins involved in DNA replication, and the cap gene, which, through 
a differential splicing mechanism, encodes three amino-terminal variant virus proteins, VP1, VP2 and 
VP3, that make up the coat of the virus.  
For the recombinant vector voretigene neparvovec, the AAV2 wild-type genome, containing rep and 
cap genes, is replaced with a therapeutic transgene expression cassette. Short regions of the wild-type 
AAV DNA containing the ITRs, required for packaging of the therapeutic genome into capsid particles 
during vector production and for expression of the therapeutic gene in vivo, are retained. The 
voretigene neparvovec active substance capsid is composed of a total of sixty viral capsid proteins, 
VP1, VP2, and VP3, that are present at a ratio of approximately 1:1:8, respectively, and assembled 
into a well-defined icosahedral structure; and one single-stranded DNA molecule containing the 
therapeutic gene expression cassette, i.e., the vector genome flanked by AAV ITRs. The vector genome 
diagram for voretigene neparvovec is given in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1 Vector genome diagram for voretigene neparvovec 
The voretigene neparvovec (AAV2-hRPE65v2) active substance is a clear, colourless solution at a 
concentration of 5 x 1012 vector genome-containing vector particles per millilitre in water for injection 
containing sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, Kolliphor P188.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacture of voretigene neparvovec takes place at Spark Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA 19104, 
USA. The site has been inspected by the MHRA Inspectorate and is covered by a GMP certificate. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of voretigene neparvovec starts with one vial of the Master Cell Bank (MCB), which is 
used to produce one active substance lot. Cells are expanded, propagated, transfected and purified.  
The purified active substance is filled into the final container closure system, which are non-pyrogenic, 
noncytotoxic, sterile and meets test requirements for USP Class VI plastics. 
The description of the manufacturing process and controls is generally adequate, with input 
parameters and process controls set out. Resin re-use and column sanitation procedures are given as 
well as process hold times. 
No re-processing or re-working has been applied for and is therefore not allowed.  
Control of materials 
The Starting Materials for manufacture of voretigene neparvovec active substance consist of a 
mammalian cell substrate and three purified recombinant DNA plasmids. AAV2 is produced in cells 
through transient transfection with three plasmids that contain the genetic information to produce the 
coded viral vector.  
Master cell bank 
The development and characterisation of the MCB and the three purified recombinant DNA plasmids 
has been adequately described. Screening for a range of specific human, bovine and porcine viruses is 
performed in accordance with ICH Q5D. The product is currently manufactured directly from vials of 
the MCB, which has been accepted. The applicant plans to implement a Working Cell bank (WCB), 
which is currently being qualified, by post-approval variation.   
A description of the derivation, characterisation and manufacture of these plasmids has been provided. 
Tests and specifications for the three plasmids consist of manufacturer’s specifications for testing of 
new lots of plasmid and additional controls performed after receipt for confirmation of new lots of 
Assessment report

plasmid prior to release. All plasmids must pass manufacturer’s specifications and internal testing 
criteria to be released by Quality Assurance for use in manufacture. The proposed tests and 
specifications for all three plasmids are considered adequate. 
Excipients and raw materials 
Sufficient information on excipients and raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing 
process has been submitted. All excipients are compendial.  
The only material of animal origin used in the current manufacturing process is foetal calf serum, which 
is supported by a certificate of suitability. The specifications for raw materials used in the 
manufacturing process are described.  
Porcine trypsin has been historically used but has been replaced with a recombinant enzyme for the 
commercial manufacture.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates and process validation 
An overview of critical in-process controls and tests performed throughout the voretigene neparvovec 
active substance manufacturing process is provided.  
The control strategy was considered overall insufficient to maintain a consistent process, and a tighter 
control was requested The applicant has now applied a tightened control, as requested. They are also 
advised that certain changes to the final approved control strategy as a result of ongoing validation 
activities should be applied for through a post-authorisation variation procedure.  
Validation 
The Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) was conducted and the process was demonstrated to 
operate consistently throughout the PPQ run.  
Process validation includes holding steps, cleaning for the CEX resin and TFF#1 membrane and 
shipping procedures and extractables and leachables, which has been adequately confirmed. 
Manufacturing process development 
The formulation of the active substance (i.e. sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, and Kolliphor P188) 
was defined based on pre-formulation and formulation studies conducted to elucidate the solution 
stability properties of the vector. The pH, buffer type and concentration of the active substance 
composition provided optimal chemical and physical stability. The finished product solution composition 
was designed to be the same as the active substance solution composition to enable a simple 
manufacturing process without requiring dilution of the active substance to produce the final product. 
Characterisation 
The voretigene neparvovec active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical 
and biological state-of-the art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure.  
Some recommendations have been made for the implementation of further characterisation methods 
to be developed and implemented, post-approval. Process-related impurities are all controlled at batch 
release. Representative results are provided and conform to pre-determined batch release 
specifications.

Specification 
The specification tests and acceptance criteria for voretigene neparvovec active substance are 
provided. 
Acceptance criteria for active substance have been set on a tolerance interval approach using historical 
manufacturing data.  
Analytical methods 
The descriptions of analytical procedures have been provided in adequate detail.  
Batch analysis 
Batch release data have been presented and all results conform to pre-determined specifications. 
Reference material 
Voretigene neparvovec have been produced and qualified for use as reference standards for release 
and stability testing of active substance and finished product. The reference standards are intended for 
use in multiple analytical procedures. The reference standard will be used as an assay control in 
release and stability assays. Primary Reference Standard Lot is filled into 2 ml sterile Crystal Zenith 
vials and stored at ≤ - 65 °C.  
To qualify new reference standards, the in-house reference standards (Primary Reference Standard, 
Working Reference Standard and Interim Reference Standard) have the same formulation as both the 
active substance and finished product. Each in-house reference standard is qualified using tests and 
criteria based on the release specifications. The Primary Reference Standard is tested alongside the 
new reference standard as part of the qualification and a qualification testing protocol has been 
provided. 
Stability 
A shelf life at -80 °C is proposed for the active substance.   
Comparability Exercise for Active Substance 
A comparability evaluation was performed to demonstrate that the active substance produced at Spark 
is comparable to the material used in the Phase III pivotal clinical study and that the change of 
manufacturing facility had no impact on the quality attributes of the active substance.  
The voretigene neparvovec manufacturing process and unit operations employed at Spark Therapeutics 
to produce commercial active substance is stated to be the same as the manufacturing process used to 
produce active substance during clinical development. The evaluation consisted of a combination of 
analytical release testing and side-by-side testing. A 1:1 comparison was employed. Spark Process 
Performance Qualification (PPQ) was compared to AAV2-hRPE65v2 clinical lot.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Luxturna finished product is a solution for injection of 5 x 1012 vector genomes per mL (0.05 mg 
vector/ml).  
The finished product is formulated as a concentrate and a solvent. Ingredients for the concentrate are 
sodium chloride, sodium phosphate and poloxamer 188. Ingredients for the solvent are sodium 
chloride, sodium phosphate, poloxamer 188 and water for injections  
It is supplied at a volume of 0.5 ml in a 2 ml Crystal Zenith vial (cyclic olefin polymer) with a 
chlorobutyl rubber stopper sealed in place with an aluminium flip-off sea. The product requires a 1:10 
dilution with diluent prior to administration. There are no novel excipients used in the manufacture of 
the finished product. All excipients are compendial. 
The composition of the finished product is considered acceptable. 
Pharmaceutical development  
The formulation of the FP has remained unchanged from preclinical supporting studies to phase I/II 
and III clinical material and commercial product. The proposed commercial product will comprise active 
substance manufactured at Spark,  
Process controls are appropriately defined. Additional data from engineering and PPQ lots indicate that 
FP and poloxamer 188 levels are maintained during the filtration step of the commercial manufacturing 
process. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
For manufacture of Luxturna FP, active substance (Bulk Vector) formulated at Spark Therapeutics is 
shipped frozen to filling site where it is processed into FP by filtration and filling into the final container, 
Crystal Zenith vials. There is no change in formulation or dilution from active substance to finished 
product. 
The Diluent is manufactured at the Nova Laboratories Ltd facility, Leicester, UK secondary packaging 
and labelling takes place at Catalent UK Packaging Limited, Lancaster Way, Wingates Industrial Estate, 
Westhoughton, UK. 
The manufacturing process has been validated and adequately described. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls and ranges defined are adequate.   
Process validation consisted of a Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) protocol performed at 
manufacturing scale, release testing as well as supporting studies including filter validation and media 
fills.  
Reprocessing and/or reworking are not permitted as part of the finished product manufacturing 
process. 
Active substance is shipped to filling site on dry-ice to maintain a target temperature of ≤ -65 ºC. The 
shipping container is qualified and validated  
During commercial distributions, finished product is shipped (at ≤ -65 °C) from the filling site to the 
secondary packaging and labelling site (Catalent UK Packaging Limited) in insulated shipping

containers (ISC) of semi-finished vials (vials with primary labels applied). The finished product shipping 
validation has been adequately carried out and data provided in the dossier. 
Product specification 
The specification tests and acceptance criteria for Luxturna finished product are provided. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
The analytical procedures required for release and stability analysis are summarised  
Biological activity is measured with an in vitro potency of enzyme assay. The assay is based on the 
quantitation of (hRPE65 transgene functional activity) of FP in human cells that contain a plasmid 
encoding.  The purpose of this assay is to determine potency of the gene expression product, RPE65. 
The purpose of this assay is to determine potency of the gene expression product, RPE65. 
Batch analysis 
The PPQ met release specifications.  
Reference material 
The same reference standard as described under active substance applies. 
Stability of the product 
The shelf life of Luxturna finished product concentrate and solvent (unopened frozen vials) is 21 
months frozen at ≤-65ºC. 
The applicant has provided device compatibility studies which include in use stability. Good in use 
stability at 2-8ºC and room temperature (after dilution and in the vial/syringe before loading into the 
device) and further in the administration canula was demonstrated. The proposed in use shelf life of 4 
hours is therefore supported. 
Comparability exercise for finished product 
A comparability evaluation was performed between the PPQ lot and the clinical lot. The evaluation 
consisted of a combination of analytical release testing and side-by-side testing. A majority of the 
comparability assessment was performed at the active substance level (see comparability for active 
substance for further detail). This is considered acceptable for those attributes not expected to change 
by processing into FP, which consists essentially of transport of the frozen active substance to the 
filling site, thaw and filling.  
Adventitious agents 
The Applicant has given a satisfactory overview of the adventitious agent control strategy together 
with an overview of all materials of human or animal origin. Control of all raw and starting materials 
has been demonstrated to be satisfactory.

Apart from New Zealand-sourced foetal bovine serum (FBS) used during the cell seeding and cell 
transfection steps, no other reagents of human or animal origin are used during manufacture. For viral 
safety, the production cell line has been tested for freedom from adventitious agents. Appropriate 
measures are taken to ensure safety with respect to bacteria, mycoplasma and TSE.  
GMO 
Voretigene neparvovec is a disabled recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector 
that contains an expression cassette for the human retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kDa protein 
(RPE65) gene. 
Voretigene neparvovec is a genetically modified organism (GMO) constructed using recombinant DNA 
technology from wild-type (wt) AAV virus serotype 2 (AAV2), which is a non-pathogenic, single-
stranded DNA genome-containing, helper virus-dependent member of the parvovirus family. 
Safety features of the virus are described above and an environmental risk assessment in accordance 
with Directive 2001/18/EC has been presented with respect to the risk of release of GMO into the 
environment. This assessment is discussed in more detail in the non-clinical part. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality package submitted for voretigene neparvovec (AAV2-hRPE65v2) was missing a substantial 
amount of information/data. Some of the missing data relates to commercialisation at a relatively early 
stage of product development. During the procedure the missing information/data has been provided 
by the applicant. Some information and data remains outstanding, and the CAT/CHMP has agreed that 
these data can be provided by the applicant as soon as they become available during the post-
authorisation phase (see recommendations 1-10).   
From the data provided, it is concluded that the manufacturing process is capable of producing a 
consistent product of acceptable quality. Comparability of the proposed commercial FP with the 
clinically qualified material was of concern, and underpinned a large number of the issues raised. 
Tightening of acceptance criteria for critical process controls and release specifications in line with 
clinically qualified material was considered necessary unless additional validation data could justify the 
wider ranges claimed. The control strategy has now been tightened in several areas, as requested, and 
additional validation datasets have been provided. Assays which were insufficiently described have now 
been more thoroughly detailed and important issues regarding the validation of several critical 
analytical methods are now largely resolved (see also “Recommendations for future quality 
development”).  
One major objection was initially raised with regard to the site of finished product release testing. In 
line with the EU legislation, the finished product must undergo in a Member State a full qualitative 
analysis, quantitative analysis of the active substance and all other necessary quality tests to certify 
compliance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation. The current FP release testing sites 
for several quality attributes (including identity, purity and potency) are located in the US. It is noted 
that the mutual recognition agreement (MRA) for GMP between the US and UK does not apply to 
ATMPs. However, the recently published Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice specific to 
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (Eudralex The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the 
European Union, Volume 4, Good Manufacturing Practice) allow some flexibility for release testing of 
ATMPs. The applicant has now justified the proposed release test arrangements. It is accepted that 
additional testing upon importation into the EU is not required since the FP is manufactured in the EU, 
and since the small batch size of this orphan product makes dual testing in the EU and US impractical 
Assessment report

on the basis that a disproportionate amount of each batch would be used up on batch 
release/importation testing. Therefore, the current testing plan has been accepted and the major 
objection was considered resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of Luxturna has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
The CAT has identified the following measures necessary to address the identified quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product: 
None. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical 
and biological aspects as described above.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT recommends the following points for investigation: 10 recommendations aimed at providing 
further data on viral testing, effect of cell passage on CQAs, monitor performance of transfection 
solutions, ability to adequately discriminate between empty and full capsids, additional characterisation 
and release test, refine analytical methods and re-valuation of specification once additional batch data 
becomes available. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the recommendation(s) for future quality 
development as described above.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant conducted comprehensive battery of tests to characterise non-clinical pharmacology and 
toxicology of Luxturna.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant presented information from experiments in mice, dogs and monkeys in which treatment 
with diverse AAVs encoding for RPE65 led to detectable RPE65 protein, where there was none before, 
restoration of the biochemical pathway in which RPE65 acts, improvement in electroretinograms and in 
pupillary responses to light stimuli and in behavioural testing, dogs were better ability to navigate an 
obstacle course after treatment, implying better vision.

In vitro testing in primary normal RPE cells and the same cell population from RPE65-/- dogs (Briard 
dogs) evaluated expression of RPE65 from AAV2-RPE65 vectors.  Briard dogs have a naturally 
occurring mutation (four base-pair deletion) in canine RPE65 that results in absence of RPE65 protein 
expression and these dogs have been subject to study over decades and, more recently, used for 
evaluating RPE65 gene transfer (Veske 1999; Narfstrom 1989).  Untreated, they show loss of vision 
and are considered to be a large animal model of human disease.  Transduction of Briard RPE cells with 
AAV2-RPE65 resulted in expression of the RPE65 transgene, with no evidence of cellular toxicity. 
Additional in vitro studies were conducted using the virus intended for clinical use (ie voretigene 
neparvovec, also called AAV2-hRPE65v2).  Transduction of normal or mutant Briard RPE cells, using 
various multiplicities of infection (MOIs), resulted in dose-dependent expression of both hRPE65 mRNA 
and protein, again with no evidence of cellular toxicity. 
An in vitro study was performed to compare the levels of RPE65 expressed in cells following 
transduction with AAV2-hRPE65v1, an earlier version of this virus which lacked certain structural 
features present in voretigene neparvovec, or following transduction with voretigene neparvovec.  Cells 
were transduced with three different MOIs (1x10e4, 5x10e4, 1x10e5 vg/cell) of either AAV2-hRPE65v1 
or voretigene neparvovec.  No detectable hRPE65 protein was observed following transduction of cells 
with AAV2-hRPE65v1 at all three MOIs.  In contrast, AAV2-hRPE65v2 resulted in dose-dependent 
RPE65 expression in cells as assessed by both immunoblot and flow cytometric analyses.  These data 
show that voretigene neparvovec could result in expression of human RPE65 protein in cells and was 
more effective than the earlier version of the virus.  However, it is an unusual finding that AAV2-
hRPE65v1 was not active in this testing as this virus was found able to cause the effects to reconstitute 
RPE65 signalling described above.  Differential limitations in sensitivity of different assays could 
contribute to this profile.  
Several in vivo studies were done in RPE65-/- mice or Briard (RPE65-/-) dogs.  In these, animals were 
dosed under general anaesthesia with, unlike in human patients, no prophylactic use of steroids to 
manage inflammation.  In some of the early studies in dogs, the virus used encoded for canine RPE65 
and not human RPE65; however, latterly, virus encoding human RPE65 (hRPE65) was also used in 
mice and dogs.  In further studies, RPE65-/- mice were also treated.  
In testing with the virus intended to be used in the clinic, ie voretigene neparvovec, there were 
improvement in measures of visual function (which for obvious reasons are more difficult to assess 
objectively in animals than in humans), and recovery in objective measures (eg  electroretinographic 
responses) with detection of human RPE65 in RPE cells, with no expression in non-RPE cells.  Clearly, 
reconstitution with human protein is able to deliver functional benefit even in REP65-/- dogs and mice.   
In these studies, animals used were typically young, reflecting the age of onset of disease in humans 
in the early years of life.  The applicant argued that a dog aged 1.5-5 months (the age of most dogs 
used) is approximately equivalent in developmental age to a human aged 2-12 years and that for 
Briard dogs, 1 year is equivalent to 10-15 human years.  Testing in older animals has not been done 
and there is no systematic evaluation of whether efficacy might be lost in older animals.  However, the 
applicant stated that the magnitude of a treatment effect is predicted to be greatest early in life, 
although, age per se is less important than evaluation of the stage of disease in the retina at the time 
of treatment. 
Regarding the duration of effect, RPE cells are expected to be postmitotic and the virus is not expected 
to be diluted through cell division, as might occur in other tissues.  Systematic study of the duration of 
response has not been undertaken, but anecdotal evidence from surviving animals indicates long term 
benefit.

Repeated dosing is intended in humans, that is, one injection into each eye: the possibility that 
immune responses might result in negation of benefit of the second dose was studied in toxicity 
studies in the context of assessing the impact of immunogenic responses.   
Safety pharmacology programme 
Separate safety pharmacology studies were not conducted and are not deemed to be necessary.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Distribution studies were included as a component of general toxicity studies.  Viral shedding was not 
studied in animals. The transgene encoded by voretigene neparvovec is considered identical to normal 
human RPE65 protein and so is expected to be metabolised in the same manner as normal human 
RPE65 protein.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicity was studied in Briard (RPE65-/-) dogs and in animals with normal RPE65 status (dogs, 
monkeys).  In these studies, virus was injected subretinally either once only, or once into each eye, 
and twice into the same eye.  These dosing strategies support the intended human dosing posology of 
one dose into each eye, ~12 days apart.  Animals were followed up after dosing for variable periods 
but the maximum period was ~7 months.  The dose used in general toxicity studies in animals 
exceeded the dose to be used in humans.   
Voretigene neparvovec caused little toxicity with the main issue being inflammatory responses at the 
injection site.  Toxicity identified was minimal and behaviour of the dosed animal was not affected by 
the described inflammatory injections.  It is the applicant’s view that, as the dose was higher in 
animals, these reactions are not likely to be a safety concern in humans.  In addition, there was 
evidence of trauma related to the injection procedure itself. 
There are no separate studies investigating reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and 
local tolerance. However, local tolerance was addressed adequately by the general toxicity studies 
conducted in dogs and monkeys.   
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The evaluation of Environmental Risk Assessment was conducted in consultation with national bodies 
responsible for release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.  The main topics were: 
batch sequencing; the p5 promoter position and potential for minimising homologous recombination 
between vector plasmid and packaging plasmid; and proof of absence of an ability to transform 
bacteria and possibly confer resistance to bacteria in the environment.  In brief, for the point on batch 
sequencing, the product will be tested for its identity on import into the EU, and will be tested for gene 
product expression and potency testing; this was considered sufficient such that sequencing of each 
bath is not necessary.  For the role of the p5 promoter in respect of how the Rep proteins are 
expressed, the applicant provided additional information, including supporting literature which 
suggests that reduced rep expression results in higher rAAV yields.  The promoter function of p5 is 
retained, but the modification to p5 reduces this; experimental evidence suggested that the 
modification of the p5 resulted in reduced rcAAV formation.  Finally, the applicant’s presented 
experimental results that were considered sufficient to support the claim that voretigene neparvovec 
does not have the ability to transform bacteria with kanamycin-resistance. 
Assessment report

It has been concluded that Luxturna does not pose a risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant presented sufficient proof of concept to support use of voretigene neparvovec in patients 
and no further studies in animals are required.  The applicant was asked to comment on the level of 
protein expression required for activity and consider this in the context of relative tropism of 
voretigene neparvovec for RPE cells from humans, as well as that for cells from mouse, dogs and 
monkeys and show how these considerations support the dose selected for use in human patients.   
The applicant noted that relative transduction efficiency of AAV2 in RPE cells across species is not 
known but that, given the sizes of eye in dog and mouse, the studies in Briard dogs are more relevant 
to human effects than those in mice; data on 11-cis-retinal regeneration in such dogs suggests 100% 
reconstitution of normal RPE65.  Minimum levels of hRPE5 reconstitution required to achieve a 
therapeutic effect in human patients are also not known.  The absolute quantity of RPE65 protein in the 
human eye is not known, but in wild type mice this varies by more than 10-fold from ~0.5-6.5 pg/cell, 
suggesting that a broad range of RPE65 protein/cell is both well-tolerated and sufficient for visual 
activity.  Because the pharmacology data indicated that efficacy could be achieved over a broad dose 
range, the determination of the optimal therapeutic dose also relied on safety data.  Data from 
monkeys showed good tolerability at a dose of 5-fold higher (7.5x1011 vg/eye) than the proposed 
therapeutic dose of 1.5x1011 vg/eye; however, some adverse effects were seen using 1x1012 vg 
AAV2-hRPE65v1/eye in normal dogs.   
There was no toxicity outside the eye and related ocular tissues apart from perivascular lymphocyte 
cuffing in the brainstem and midbrain.  The applicant claimed that this may be a result of immune 
response to the vector.  The applicant was requested to comment further on this and in so doing, 
indicated that a possible cause is leakage of the vector by reflux into the vitreous chamber that may 
lead to exposure to the ganglion cells to the vector, leading of transport of both vector and transgene 
to regions of the brain of the dogs.  Since in dogs and primates, presence in the brain of vector 
sequences was not reported, vector leakage was considered to be limited.  Additionally, in humans, 
measures taken to use a lower dose and use a fluid-air exchange to remove the fluid following 
intravitreal injection, removing potentially vector leakage, are expected to limit the potential effects of 
leakage and its consequences. 
In respect of biodistribution, the applicant’s view was that following subretinal injection there is no 
systemic exposure to AAV2 and hRPE65 is not expressed except in tissue that is both exposed to virus 
and has the necessary components to make RPE65 protein.  This is supported by the lack of expression 
of hRPE65 protein when injected into the vitreous and the lack of ability to identify voretigene 
neparvovec virus in systemic tissues.  However, as assays used to detect virus and immune response 
to the capsid and the transgene were not validated to an acceptable standard, these data are not 
considered to be definitive.   
Voretigene neparvovec delivers human protein to animals and also, unlike in humans, wild-type AAV2 
does not naturally infect animals; these elements suggest that immunogenic responses might occur in 
animals; toxicity evaluations suggested influx to the dosing area of inflammatory cell types assays.  
When RPE65-/- animals were injected, there was no safety issue identified from immunogenic 
reactions.  Further, the effect of a second injection on transgene expression on activity to improve 
visual function was not compromised by an immune response to the earlier dose.  In normal animals, 
voretigene neparvovec did not lead to antibody responses against pre-existing RPE65 protein.  If there 
is concern that, in humans, immune responses to injection of voretigene neparvovec could lead to 
compromise of that degree of hRPE65 function that was remaining prior at the time of injection, there 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 21/97 
 
  
was no evidence to support this from the preclinical testing conducted.  hRPE65 is not expressed in the 
cell membrane and is located intracellularly and so elimination of transduced cells based on cell-
membrane expression of hRPE65 is not an anticipated risk.  However, T cell responses were observed 
to the AAV capsid.   
In respect of long term safety, systematic data in long term follow up of animals given voretigene 
neparvovec were not provided.  There is anecdotal information of no concerns identified from a small 
number of dogs given voretigene neparvovec.  However, long term follow up in studies in the literature 
with rAAV vectors have not identified specific concerns over years of follow up, covering most of the 
dosed animals’ lifespans.  
The key findings of relevance to the RMP suggested from the preclinical safety studies are of 
inflammatory reactions, either to AAV2 capsid or to hRPE65 protein, and risks associated with the 
intervention associated with dosing voretigene neparvovec, such as infection and accidental trauma.  
The patient population to be treated might reasonably be expected to live for decades after dosing and 
be of an age where they will have children after being treated with voretigene neparvovec.  In respect 
of the risk posed to reproductive health, the applicant’s position, that studies are not needed with 
voretigene neparvovec, rests on two sources of evidence.  1) is that there is no dissemination of 
voretigene neparvovec to the gonads in either dogs or monkeys and 2) is by reference to published 
literature.  Literature suggests that AAV2 (and other rAAV subtypes) can be detected in the semen of 
animals dosed systemically, but virus does not persist, being cleared within a few days: vector 
sequences are not detected in spermatocytes.  The risk is reduced comparing this information derived 
from intravenous dosing, with subretinal dosing, as intended with voretigene neparvovec.  The 
applicant acknowledged that there are fewer data on risk of germline transmission in females.  The 
applicant concluded that reproductive toxicity studies with voretigene neparvovec are not needed.   
The CHMP previously gave scientific advice that such studies would not be needed if ‘biodistribution 
data in two species and two sexes demonstrate lack of vector distribution to the gonads’.  The 
applicant considers its dataset to be in line with this advice from CHMP.  
Although no distribution in the gonads was reported, two animals showed positive signals in the 
aqueous fluid of the uninjected eye and no signal in the aqueous fluid of the injected eye. There was 
also a description that PCR reported no signal in ovaries, whereas the two dogs concerned were males; 
a similar error occurred in the description of biodistribution data from primates.  Ultimately, no 
explanation for these errors was identified, but gonadal tissues from 18 animals (dogs and primates) 
were examined with no positive results, which is reassuring. 
Concerning genotoxicity, this was addressed in the two scientific advice procedures with CHMP, in 2013 
and 2015.  The position at the conclusion of these was that the applicant need provide no experimental 
data with voretigene neparvovec and that a discussion could suffice, if judged adequate.  It is 
acknowledged that there may be some integration events but these are expected to be at random 
sites: the risk is greatest where the concentration of virus is greatest ie in the retinal pigment epithelial 
cells.  This tissue is understood to be post-mitotic in patients that could be given voretigene 
neparvovec.  AAV integration requires the cells to be dividing and as a consequence, the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis seems limited: it would not be further understood by requiring experimental 
work with voretigene neparvovec.  CHMP also advised that in vivo testing in 2-year carcinogenicity 
studies in mice or rats would not contribute meaningful data to assessing the risk of carcinogenicity.   
The CHMP endorses the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data on expression of RPE65 in the retina of injected animals and functional consequences of this 
(biochemistry, electroretinography, pupillometry and behaviour) are sufficient.  An acceptable 
evaluation of toxicity has been presented and all points raised were resolved.  The non-clinical data 
support a decision in favour of granting a marketing authorisation for this application.   
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme has consisted of one phase I study, one phase II study, one 
phase III study, a natural history study and a study to validate the mobility testing tool developed by 
the company. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional pharmacokinetic characterisation of the product is not possible and not expected from 
gene therapy products. Given that AAV2-hRPE65v2 is a gene therapy vector administered via 
subretinal injection and that systemic exposure is considered to be minimal, it is acceptable. In this 
regard, the main information regarding vector delivery into the target tissue, persistence of expression 
and the presence of the functional protein is based on nonclinical studies and vector shedding results 
from clinical studies.  Pharmacokinetic investigation has been limited to a description of elimination of 
study drug. In clinical studies AAV2-hRPEv2 vector was detected in tears in 17/31 patients (8 subjects 
treated in Phase 3 study and 9 subjects treated in Phase 1 studies) and peripheral blood samples in 
9/31 patients. AAV2-hRPEv2 vector shedding into either tears or peripheral blood appeared to be 
transient in nature, with the majority of positive samples occurring between one and three days after 
vector administration. During this three day window, vector shedding tended to be localized to tear 
samples from the injected eye. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Patients with Leber congenital amaurosis or with retinitis pigmentosa develop progressive sight loss, 
starting early in life (eg a few years of age) progressing to total blindness.  This can arise from 
mutations in the RPE65 gene which encodes for a protein known as RPE65, which is a 65 kilodalton 
protein specific for the retinal pigment epithelium.  Voretigene neparvovec is a gene therapy based on 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 into which the human RPE65 gene has been inserted.  After 
Assessment report

subretinal injection, the product is intended to deliver expression of normal RPE65 protein to 
reconstitute function of the retinoid cycle, critical in converting incident photons into interpretable 
electrical signals, and restore vision. 
In normal health, RPE65 in retinal pigment epithelial cells converts all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol, 
which subsequently forms the chomophore, 11-cis-retinal, during the visual (retinoid) cycle, steps 
critical in conversion of a photon of light into an electrical signal within the retina.  RPE65 gene 
mutations lead to reduced or absent levels of RPE65, blocking this signalling, leading to loss of vision.  
Over time, accumulation of toxic precursors may contribute to the death of retinal pigment epithelial 
cells and photoreceptor cell death by when the possibility to correct vision loss by voretigene 
neparvovec may be lost, with loss of its target cell population.  Use of voretigene neparvovec in 
patients prior to loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells is intended to restore normal RPE65 protein 
function and so improve the patient’s vision.  
Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics were investigated in main clinical studies by measurement of visual acuity, visual 
field depiction and by measurement of the sensitivity of the retinal to light. The results are described in 
the clinical efficacy section. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The investigation of clinical pharmacology was quite limited. However, this is acceptable in the context 
of a gene therapy for a rare disease that is administered directly to the sub-retinal space of each eye 
as a once-only surgical procedure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology dossier submitted in support of Luxturna is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Selection of the dose level employed (1.5E11 vg per eye) was based on a combination of non-clinical 
studies and the results of the Phase 1 studies (AAV2-hRPE65v2-101 and AAV2-hRPE65v2-102) which 
had indicated that a dose of 1.5E11 vg in a volume of 300 μl was safe and well tolerated in a similar 
patient population (the high dose was taken forward as all doses had similar safety profiles).  
A dose-response effect could be neither established nor eliminated due to phenotypic variations of the 
subjects enrolled. In the absence of a dose response effect, the volume of 300 μl utilized for the Phase 
1 high dose cohort targets a larger portion of the retina and thus provides a greater likelihood for 
direct benefit to the individual subjects.  
Escalating beyond the dose of 1.5E11 vg per eye introduces greater potential for risk, including 
irreversible toxicity based on the nature of retinal cells, without clear evidence of greater potential for 
benefit. Delivery of volume larger than 300 μl, thereby reducing the concentration of the vector and

potentially facilitating further dose escalation, would complicate the surgical procedure, may increase 
the potential for prolonged retinal detachments, and would be more disruptive to the subjects in the 
days immediately following surgeries. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A Safety and Efficacy Study in Subjects with Leber Congenital Amaurosis 
(LCA) Using Adeno-Associated Viral Vector to Deliver the Gene for Human 
RPE65 to the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria

measured by III4e isopter or equivalent (both eyes). 
• 
Sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means such as OCT and / or 
ophthalmoscopy. Must have either:  
1) an area of retina within the posterior pole of >100μm thickness shown on OCT 
2) ≥ 3 disc areas of retina without atrophy or pigmentary degeneration within the posterior pole

• 
Subjects must be evaluable on mobility testing (the primary efficacy endpoint) to be eligible for 
the study. 
Subjects who were able to pass the mobility course at Screening, in the time allotted, at the lowest 
illumination to be evaluated (1 lux) were to be considered too close to normal function with respect to 
ability to navigate in dim light conditions; these subjects were not eligible to enrol on the study.  
Subjects who were unable to perform the mobility course at Screening with an accuracy score of ≤ 1 at 
the highest illumination to be evaluated (400 lux) were to be considered to have extensive disease 
progression such that they are less likely to achieve measurable, clinically meaningful benefit; these 
subjects were not eligible to enrol on the study. 
Exclusion criteria 
•

surgery or interfere with the interpretation of study 
Treatments 
Delivery of AAV2-hRPE65v2 used a standardised procedure optimised during the phase 1 dose-
escalation and safety study. Vector administration was performed using a commercially available 
cannula designed for sub-retinal injection, the Bausch and Lomb Storz 39 gauge translocation cannula 
(Rancho Cucamonga, CA). Sub-retinal injection was performed after a standard 3-port pars plana 
vitrectomy. 
The gene therapy material was administered in the ophthalmology surgical suite of each study site. 
Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia supplemented by retrobulbar anaesthetic to 
minimise intra-operative eye movement and postoperative discomfort. The site of the sub-retinal 
injection was in the post-equatorial retina within the posterior pole. An area approximately one third to 
one fourth of the total retinal area was targeted. This site was selected to maximise the potential that 
viable retinal cells were exposed to the vector.  
Provided that the condition of viable retinal cells was met, the extent of the injection included a portion 
of the macular area, as this is the region that normally provides the highest degree of visual function 
and sensitivity and thus successful treatment of this area was predicted to result in the greatest 
therapeutic effect. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine whether non-simultaneous, bilateral sub-retinal administration 
of AAV2-hRPE65v2 improved the ability to navigate (as measured by mobility testing) in adults and 
children, three years of age or older, with RPE65 mutations. 
The secondary objective of this study was to continue to assess the safety and tolerability of AAV2-
hRPE65v2 administrations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the subject’s bilateral performance (no eye patching) on the 
mobility test, as measured by a change score, one year following vector administration as compared to 
a subject’s Baseline bilateral mobility test performance. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were: 
• 
Full-field sensitivity threshold testing: Average light sensitivity (averaged over both eyes) for 
white light at Year 1B/C as compared to Baseline light sensitivity testing 
•  Monocular mobility testing change score: Change from Baseline to Year 1B/C in the score of 
the mobility testing for the first eye 
•  Visual acuity: Average change in visual acuity (averaged over both eyes) at Year 1B/C as 
compared to Baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 26/97 
 
  
 
 
 
For FST, a subject’s response is light sensitivity as measured in decibels (dB) which was converted to 
the logarithm of candela second per square meter (log10[cd.s/m2]) to accommodate different dB 
conversion rates.  
Visual acuity was converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). 
Analyses of FST and VA were based on longitudinal models that provided estimates of the difference 
between Baseline and Year 1B/C. For the monocular mobility testing, analyses used models analogous 
to the model described for the primary outcome. 
Sample size 
At least twenty-seven subjects, three years of age or older, were to be recruited at either The 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Site 001) or University of Iowa (Site 005). 
Randomisation  
Study 301 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the Intervention or the Control group, stratified 
by Screening age (≥ 10 years or < 10 years) and mobility testing category (passing at ≥ 125 lux or 
passing at < 125 lux).  
Stratification was considered important due to the variability of the patient population (e.g., age, 
disease-causing mutation, sequence variants in other retina-specific genes, extent of retinal 
degeneration, clinical history, and clinical presentation [range of functioning or vision loss]) and small 
sample size of the study.  
In an effort to balance the Intervention and Control groups, the age and mobility testing performance 
cut-offs were chosen based on expected age of study participants given the study site lists of 
interested patients and based on experience with mobility testing of participants in the Phase 1 studies 
for AAV2-hRPE65v2, as well as the initial observations from the MTVS study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The Phase 3 study was open-label, rather than a double-masked placebo-controlled trial, as the use of 
a sham-sub-retinal surgery group as the concurrent control arm was rejected for ethical reasons, 
particularly given the inclusion of paediatric participants.  
One of the main risks of the study was general anaesthesia required for surgical intervention. 
Additionally, though vitrectomy is a routine procedure for surgeons with vitreo-retinal surgical training, 
surgical complications (including infection) are known to occur. Given the risks associated with sham-
sub-retinal surgery, and the lack of a prospect of direct benefit for subjects randomized to such a 
control group, the Applicant determined a delayed-intervention control group was more ethically 
appropriate than a masked, sham-subretinal surgery group. Thus, masking procedures were 
considered important to support the validity of the study results. 
To mitigate the potential for bias and to support the validity of the study results, groups independent 
from both the applicant and the clinical study teams scored and analysed the primary efficacy endpoint 
(mobility testing).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 27/97 
 
  
 
 
 
Graders of the mobility testing were independent from the study team and had received training. 
These individuals received coded mobility testing videos on a weekly basis and received no information 
about the subjects, visit schedule, treatment group, results of any other retinal/visual function testing, 
or even the identity of the clinical study (as the applicant utilizes this Video Reading Center for more 
than one study).  
An independent data management group assigned the video’s code and the masked sequence in which 
videos were presented so that graders did not know whether the video they were evaluating was a 
Baseline evaluation or a follow-up evaluation for any given subject.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was to use a non-parametric permutation test based on a Wilcoxon rank-
sum as the observed test statistic and an exact method for the corresponding p-value. The planned 
approach was to randomize the allocation of treatment label to subject and, for a large number of 
replications, to calculate the test statistic from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The p-value from the 
permutation test was to be the proportion of p-values that were smaller than the value observed in the 
actual dataset. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistic was to use the average rank when observations 
had the same value (i.e., were tied).  
The permutation test was to sample 10,000 times from the distribution of possibilities. However, when 
following the actual blocked randomization to determine this distribution, the total number of 
permutations was less than 10,000 for both the ITT and mITT analysis populations. Therefore, the 
randomization test used the set of all possible permutations. 
 The primary efficacy outcome was to be tested at a two-sided Type I error rate of 0.05. Unless 
mentioned otherwise, all other statistical tests were to use two-sided significance criteria of α = 0.05. 
Confidence intervals were to be two-sided.  
While the primary interest of this study was the performance of the subjects at Year 1B (Intervention) 
and Year 1C (Control), the pattern of response over time was also considered to be relevant to 
understanding the effects of the therapy, as well as the effects of non-intervention (natural history). 
Exploratory analyses were to examine change over time.

Intervention group and five (50%) subjects in the Control group. They are not considered likely to 
affect overall conclusions of the study. 
Baseline data 
Population 
Overall, 31 subjects were randomized into the study AAV2-hRPE65v2-301, including 21 Original 
Intervention subjects and 10 Original Control subjects. A summary of subjects by study site is shown 
in the following table: 
Table 1 Enrolment by Study Site and Strata (ITT) 
Enrolment into the Intervention group was evenly divided across the CHOP and Iowa sites (52% and 
48%, respectively). For the Control group, more subjects were enrolled by CHOP as compared to Iowa 
(80% and 20%, respectively).  
Study enrolment was stratified by subject age (< 10 years and ≥ 10 years) and Screening mobility 
testing level (pass at < 125 lux and pass at ≥ 125 lux). In cases where unilateral differences in the 
mobility testing results at Screening were observed, the worse eye was used for stratification. 
For the Intervention group, subjects were relatively evenly divided across age strata (43% < 10 years 
of age; 57% ≥ 10 years of age) and Screening mobility (57% pass at < 125 lux; 43% pass at ≥ 125 
lux. Similar strata characteristics were seen in the Control group, with 40% of subjects < 10 years of 
age and 40% of subjects passing the Screening mobility testing procedures at < 125 lux.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy outcome was the performance on the Mobility Test as measured by a change 
score one year following vector administration (Intervention subjects), or one year following Baseline 
(Control subjects), as compared to a subject’s Baseline mobility test performance, under the bilateral 
eye-patching testing scenario.  
In general, a subject may be classified as having improved, stable, or worsened ability to navigate 
under low light conditions. The mobility testing protocol used in Phase 1 studies of AAV2-hRPE65v2 
was expanded to include testing under mesopic (lower light) conditions, the conditions that elicit 
responses from both rod and cone photoreceptors. The test design was also refined such that courses 
were standardized to contain a specified number of turns and numbers of specific types of obstacles, 
as was the videotaping protocol thereby enabling more accurate scoring of the tests by trained, 
independent graders. 
To optimize and ensure greatest consistency of mobility testing procedures, the following changes were 
implemented during the standardization process: 
Assessment report

The testing rooms at the two study sites were established in parallel, using the same configuration of 
LED and incandescent lighting panels to achieve pre-set (programmed) luminances; the precise panel 
settings used for the pre-set luminances accommodated differences in room height between the sites. 
Each room was evaluated, using multiple calibrated light meters as well as specialized 
photometer/radiometer equipment, prior to study start and determined to be remarkably similar with 
respect to the seven specified light levels. Throughout the study, the pre-set luminances were 
continually evaluated by the placement of calibrated light meters at five places on the course (center 
and four corners). 
Following a 40-minute dark adaption, each subject was to be tested under at least two and sometimes 
three or more different (specified) lighting conditions for each eye and then with both eyes open (at 
least six test runs). The levels of light, selected to span lighting conditions that individuals encounter in 
daily life, were to range from a studio with floodlights (400 lux) or a brightly lit office (250 lux) down 
to a poorly lit sidewalk at night (1 lux). The estimated light sensitivity cut-off was to be determined for 
each subject for each eye following testing at levels including 1, 4, 10, 50, 125, 250, or 400 lux (going 
from dimmest to brightest). More than six tests per subject, per visit were to be performed if the 
subject’s estimated light sensitivity cut-off at Baseline differed from one eye to the other. The course 
was to be reconfigured between each attempt, using twelve standardized templates, to reduce the 
impact of a potential learning effect. 
At the first follow-up visit after Baseline, mobility testing was to be carried out using the light 
sensitivity cut-off identified at Baseline and at lighting conditions just below this cut-off (sub-sensitivity 
cut-off light level). For example, if the light sensitivity cut-off at Baseline was 125 lux, follow-up 
testing was to be carried out at 125 lux and 50 lux.

Visual acuity 
Visual acuity, or best-corrected visual acuity, measures were to document any change in central vision, 
the ability to resolve standard optotype images presented as optotypes/letters corresponding to 
different visual angles i.e. image size.  
At one year after exposure to voretigene neparvovec, improvement in visual acuity of at least 0.3 
LogMAR occurred in 11 (55%) of the first-treated eyes and 4 (20%) of the second-treated eyes; no 
one in the control group displayed such an improvement of visual acuity in either the first or second 
eye.

Ancillary analyses 
Durability of the Treatment Effect 
Overall, the available clinical efficacy data to date support an onset of AAV2-hRPE65v2 treatment 
effect by approximately 30 days post-administration with durable improvements in visual function that 
are maintained for at least one year. For Study 301 / 302, subjects in the Original Intervention group 
have demonstrated durable improvements in visual performance across multiple endpoints for at least 
two years following AAV2-hRPE65v2 administration. Similarly, subjects in the Control / Intervention 
group, once injected with AAV2-hRPE65v2, have demonstrated a comparable onset and durability in 
visual performance improvements to those observed in the Original Intervention group, through at 
least one year following bilateral AAV2-hRPE65v2 administration. 
As a supportive analysis, combined presentations of the bilateral MLMT and FST scores, means over 
time, for Study 301 / 302 and Study 102 are provided in the following figure:

As seen in Figure 9, for both MLMT (upper panel) and FST (lower panel), the onset and durability of the 
treatment responses across Study 301 / 302 and Study 102 were similar. More specifically, for both 
endpoints, marked improvements were observed by approximately 30 days post-administration for 
each study and the respective treatment effects were maintained across the evaluated time periods, 
with a durable mean change from injection baseline seen from one to three years post-vector 
administration. 
Overall, for both Phase 3 and Phase 1, the observed mean improvements in functional vision, light 
sensitivity, and visual function suggest consistent, durable treatment of vision loss following AAV2-
hRPE65v2 administration, through at least three years for Phase 1 subjects and for up to two years in 
Phase 3 subjects, with observation ongoing.

Primary 
MLMT 
Multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT): 
endpoint 
subject’s performance (no eye patching) on 
the mobility test using binocular vision, as 
measured by a change score, one year 
following vector administration as compared 
to a subject’s Baseline performance. 
The mobility test tool is a clinic-based 
clinician-reported outcome assessment tool. 
Subjects are asked to navigate between start 
and finish in a stylised obstacle course at 
ambient light set at one level between 400 
lux and 1 lux during each attempt. The main 
analysis was of binocular navigation of the 
test layout. 
Subjects are marked as either 'pass' or 'fail'; 
a 'pass' mark requires the subject to 
complete the task within 180 secs and to 'fail 
to navigate' 3 or less obstacles. A 'pass' mark 
at 1 lux is the highest possible score. 
The tool returns ordinal scores of between -1 
and +6 (pass at 1 lux).  
Secondary

Outcomes: Subjects have been followed up for 8 years. 
10 (83%) subjects experienced TEAEs considered related to the study drug administration e.g. eye 
irritation and hyperaemia, one instance of macular hole. 
Efficacy endpoints included assessments of visual acuity, full field light sensitivity, pupillometry and 
mobility testing (a version of the test that accompanied study 301/2) 
Mobility testing was designed to approximate real life orientation and mobility in a clinical setting. 
The mobility testing protocol was refined over the course of the study, as reflected in the pre- and 
post-standardization listings, and this affects both the interpretation of the results and the number of 
subjects considered evaluable. 
The first four subjects (NP-01, NP-02, NP-03, and NP-04) were considered non-evaluable given the 
inconsistent use of patching, as well as the variability of lighting conditions and test course difficulty. 
Differences between the injected and un-injected eyes, or between Baseline and follow-up testing with 
the injected eye, were not readily observed for CH-06, CH-11, CH-12 or CH-13. 
Both CH-12 and CH-13, the oldest individuals in the study and the most advanced in terms of disease 
progression, did not pass any mobility testing runs over the course of the study.

Rationale for study 
Mutations in the human retinal pigment epithelium 65 gene (RPE65) result in progressive visual 
deterioration, leading inexorably to blindness, with the onset of symptoms typically occurring early in 
life.  
Leber congenital amaurosis is a clinical diagnosis commonly associated with mutations in the RPE65 
gene, but other similar clinical diagnoses, such as Retinitis Pigmentosa and various iterations of Early 
Onset Retinal Dystrophy have also been attributed to mutations in this gene.  
Since retinal disease caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene is relatively uncommon, the existing body 
of information describing the natural history and disease course is somewhat limited. This retrospective 
descriptive study was designed to ascertain the natural history of the disease and clinical course in 
individuals with retinal degenerative disease caused by mutations in RPE65.  
This study collected clinical data from seven tertiary referral centres for retinal degenerative diseases 
worldwide, with the objective of determining the degree and rate of disease progression over time by 
evaluating various clinical data points, including VA testing, VF testing, optical coherence tomography 
and other visual function parameters from a large cohort of subjects. 
Study objectives 
To describe the natural history of retinal degenerative disease in subjects with mutations in the RPE65 
gene utilizing longitudinal ocular history review and clinical testing, including assessments of visual 
acuity, visual fields, colour vision and light sensitivity, when available. In addition, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), electroretinograms (ERG), and dilated fundus examinations with retinal imaging 
and comprehensive ophthalmic exam data were also collected. 
The main objectives were to obtain data on visual acuity, Goldmann kinetic visual fields and optical 
coherence tomography.

Enrolment by site is shown in the following table: 
Table 6 Enrolment by Site  
The screen failure rate was lower than anticipated, resulting in a total of 70, rather than 40, eligible 
subjects. 
Charts were obtained from tertiary referral centres and so the geographic location of the centre may 
not necessarily correspond to the country of origin (or current country of residence) of the subject. 
Due to the retrospective nature of this study, not all charts contained the same information. Based on 
the extent of the available data, the primary parameters analysed included visual acuity testing, 
Goldmann kinetic visual fields testing and optical coherence tomography.

Subject demographics are summarized in the following table: 
Table 7 Demographic Summary 
Clinical history 
General clinical history 
Subject charts were collected from tertiary referral centres for inherited retinal disease and, in most 
cases, there was limited medical and/or surgical history available from the eligible charts. 
Eye history 
From the data available in the study charts, it did not appear that subjects were reliably or consistently 
queried at every visit regarding the presence or absence of orientation/mobility issues, use of low 
vision aids, nyctalopia, or photophobia. Therefore, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions 
regarding the prevalence of these conditions in this study population.  
For purposes of standardization, an attempt was made to classify the verbatim comments into broad 
categories describing function, as summarised: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 53/97 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 8 Ocular History at the Initial Visit 
For a few subject charts with multiple visits over time, there was a clear progression of worsening 
vision, decreasing visual fields, and increasing reliance on visual aids, providing evidence of the decline 
in the ability to function independently as retinal degeneration continues and visual function is 
increasingly compromised. 
Clinical diagnosis 
A total of 76 clinical diagnoses were reported in the charts of the 70 subjects, with some subjects 
having more than one diagnosis at the time of the initial visit. In addition, subjects may have received 
one clinical diagnosis early on, which was subsequently changed over time as more information 
(usually genetic testing results) became available. 
Among the 76 clinical diagnoses at the time of the first reported visit, 42 (55.3%) were LCA, 6 (7.9%) 
were RP, 5 (6.6%) were tapetal retinal dystrophy, 5 (6.6%) were SECORD, and 4 (5.3%) were EOSRD. 
3 subjects each had a clinical diagnosis of “low vision” or “tapetal retinal dystrophy, Leber type”, while 
2 subjects each had a clinical diagnosis of “RPE65-related LCA” and “cone rod dystrophy”. There were 
12 subjects who had other unique clinical diagnoses. In total, there were 21 distinct clinical diagnoses 
assigned to this study population at the time of the initial visit.  
There were 31 subjects who had more than one clinical diagnosis over the course of their visits. The 
average number of clinical diagnoses for this study population is 3, with a minimum of 1 and maximum 
of 7. There were 9 subjects who received a diagnosis of both LCA and RP over the course of their 
visits. 
The age at clinical diagnosis was obtained from the 70 subject charts; for 48 charts (68.6%), subjects 
were younger than 18 years of age at the time of the recorded clinical diagnosis. 17 other subjects had 
the presence of symptoms noted at ages under 18. 
Genetic diagnosis 
All eligible subject charts had confirmation of autosomal recessive RPE65 mutation(s). 
A number of mutations known to be associated with LCA, SECORD, and RP were observed. A total of 
56 unique RPE65 mutations were observed in this study population, with 27 individuals (38.6%; 9 
were homozygous) having at least one mutation known to be associated with LCA, 37 individuals (52.9 
%; 7 were homozygous) having at least one mutation associated with SECORD, or RP, and 18

individuals (25.7%; 9 were homozygous) with other mutations not previously described in the context 
of any of these clinical diagnoses. 
Data 
Visual acuity 
The method of visual acuity assessment obtained from the charts ranged from preferential gaze using 
Teller cards in pre-verbal children, to Allen Cards in older children, to Snellen acuity charts in adults. 
For purposes of standardization, all visual acuity assessments from the primary source were converted 
to decimals and then to LogMAR values using the following formula of Holladay (1997): 
LogMAR= -Log (Decimal Acuity) 
For the majority of available visual acuity assessments, each eye was measured separately; bilateral 
VA assessments were more limited. For purposes of this analysis, VA results are presented for the right 
eye and left eye, separately, using standardized LogMAR units. When available, best-corrected VA 
(BCVA) was used, as this is the standard and customary method of collecting VA assessments; 
however, there were many subject charts where BCVA was not clearly specified. 
Data were collected from each subject over time at different ages, and longitudinal analyses for the 
effect of age on VA, using both Holladay and Lange scales for off-chart measurements, were 
performed. Data obtained from subjects between the ages of 0-3 were excluded due to the difficulty in 
obtaining reliable VA assessments in very young children. 
There were a total of 309 measurements for the left eye and 331 measurements for the right eye 
collected from 68 subjects. Each subject had a varying number of measurements.

Table 10 Visual Acuity by Age Group (Right Eye) 
Visual field data 
Visual field assessments were collected primarily using manual Goldmann kinetic perimetry. 
Cumulative visual fields were calculated across 24 meridians for each stimulus tested (III4e, V4e, and 
other test stimuli [I3e, I4e, II4e, IV4e]).  
For each stimulus tested, the outcome measure is the sum total meridian degrees (or sum total 
degrees); higher sum total degrees indicate a greater area of functional and light sensitive retina, 
corresponding to a greater field of vision for the subject.  
The sum total meridian degrees represents a summation of the measure of degrees from central 
fixation to the point of the isopter intersection for each of the 24 meridians. Using this approach, the 
maximal visual field is approximately 1400-1800 sum total meridian degrees in individuals without 
visual impairment.  
For purposes of standardization, kinetic visual fields obtained using automated Octopus technology (11 
subjects) were excluded from this analysis, as were computerized static Humphrey visual fields (13 
subjects), since the available data were not sufficient for analysis. 
Data were collected from each subject over time at different ages, and were analyzed for the right eye 
and left eye, separately. Longitudinal analyses for the effect of age on visual field by test stimulus type 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018

(III4e and V4e only) were conducted. Goldmann visual fields using other test stimulus types (I3e, I4e, 
II4e, IV4e) were excluded from this analysis. 
Subjects who had only one measurement for each eye were excluded. A total of 161 measurements for 
the left eye and 160 measurements for the right eye were collected from 27 subjects (with repeated 
III4e and V4e measurements). Each subject had a varying number of measurements. If there were 
multiple measurements obtained for the same eye and same test stimulus type on the same date, the 
average of the measurements was used. 
Data are summarised in the figures below:

On average, in this cohort, a 1 year increase in age decreased the III4e visual field by approximately 
25 sum total degrees in each eye; the less discriminatory V4e visual field, which tended to be larger 
than the visual field as measured by III4e, decreased by approximately 37 sum total degrees, in each 
eye.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The company conducted a natural history study (code RPE65 NHx) of 32 subjects with a diagnosis of 
Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2. Visual acuity in these subjects was shown to progressively 
deteriorate from birth; there was an acceleration of deterioration in visual acuity after the late teenage 
years. The areas of subjects’ visual fields were also shown to decline progressively from a young age. 
Thickness of the retinal layer of the eye, however, did not change up to years mid-30s. 
The company has submitted clinical intervention studies 101 and 102; these were open-label, 
uncontrolled, non-randomised phase I studies in subjects with Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2. 
Study 101 enrolled 12 subjects (7 male, 5 female) ages 8 to 44yrs with Leber’s congenital amaurosis 
and visual acuity ≤ 20/160. Study drug was administered to one eye (direct to the sub-retinal space) 
at either low dose (1.5E10 vg), medium dose (4.8E10 vg) or high dose (1.5E11 vg). 11 of these 
subjects later went forwards to study 102 to have the study drug administered to the second eye at 
dose 1.5E11 vector genomes (vg). Efficacy was measured by score achieved on an in-house mobility 
assessment tool (under development at this stage). The results of studies 101 and 102 encouraged the 
company to develop its in-house mobility assessment tool and to go forward to study 301/2 using the 
high dose of study drug i.e. 1.5E11 vg AAV2-hRPE65v2 (per eye) delivered in a total sub-retinal 
volume of 300μL. The mobility assessment tool was further developed for use in studies 301/302. 
The final version of the mobility assessment tool as used in study 301/302 is a 7 foot by 12 foot 
obstacle course with 15 obstacles of varying size, shape and colour; 1 of 12 described routes may be 
chosen; ambient light may be reduced from 400 lux to 1 lux to conduct the study; subjects are marked 
according to time taken to go from start to finish and by success in avoiding or navigating obstacles in 
the path. 3 errors in navigation were permitted per run. Penalty points were added for infringements. 
A pass time score of <180 seconds was chosen. Subjects were marked as ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ based on the 
accuracy and time scores. The tool returns an ordinal result.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 59/97 
 
  
 
 
 
A validation exercise for the tool has been submitted by the company comparing scores achieved by 
healthy subjects with subjects with a variety of eye diseases (not only Leber’s congenital amaurosis).  
The mobility tool is considered to display notable deficiencies. Thus, a pass time score of <180 seconds 
leads to a broad 'ceiling effect' that will impair the ability of the tool to detect change over time. 
Further, subjects in the control phase of study 301/302 demonstrate ±1 change in score over 1 year 
and so change would need to exceed this in order to be considered clinically significant. 
The efficacy of voretigene neparvovec (AAV2-hRPE65v2) in the treatment of LCA patients with RPE65 
mutations was evaluated in pivotal study 301/302. 
• 
Study 301 was an open label, randomised, multi-centre, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of AAV2- hRPE65v2 to subjects with Leber congenital amaurosis due to RPE65 
mutations. Intervention subjects received sequential, bilateral, subretinal administration of AAV2-
hRPE65v2 while Control subjects remained un-injected for one year.  
• 
After the first year of un-injected follow up, Control subjects were eligible to cross over to 
injection with AAV2-hRPE65v2 (study 302). 
A single pivotal study was deemed to be acceptable considering the rarity and the progressive nature 
of the pursued indication. The clinical program as well as the design and outcomes of the Study 301 
were discussed during a protocol assistance in July 2013 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/429802/2013) and a 
follow-up protocol assistance in December 2015 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/819724/2015).  
Study 301/302 recruited patients aged 3 years old or older, with LCA genetically confirmed to be due 
of RPE65 mutations with documented sufficient viable retinal cells were eligible for the study. Patients 
were selected according to the visual function deterioration (visual acuity 20/60 or worse, or visual 
field less than 20 degrees in any meridian), a relevant clinical feature of the disease, and the ability to 
perform a mobility testing within the luminance range evaluated in the study. The study was conducted 
in two centres in USA (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Iowa). A total of 5 patients 
(16%) were from EU countries.   
A total of 36 patients were screened and 31 out of 36 were randomized (ITT population).  A total of 29 
patients (20 in the Intervention group and 9 in the Control group) formed the mITT population. The 
limited number of patients is acceptable given the rarity of the disease. 
Overall 13 (42%) males and 18 (58%) females were included. The mean age at randomization was 
15.1 years, with patients from 4 to 44 years. Overall 42% patients were younger than 10 years and 
58% were equal or older than 10 years. Subjects of less than 3 years of age were not considered for 
this study. The main limitation in children less than three years of age comes from the risks associated 
with the surgical administration procedure 
All patients presented nystagmus and retina abnormalities at entry. Strabismus was reported in eight 
(38%) intervention subjects and five (50%) control subjects. At Baseline visual acuity (averaged 
across both eyes) was severely impaired (mean logMAR 1.18 in the intervention group and 1.29 in the 
control group), and all subjects recruited in the study presented low vision (≥ 0.6 LogMAR, equivalent 
to 20/80, or greater).  
Molecular diagnosis confirmed the mutation in the RPE65 gene and a wide range of mutations were 
reported. Different point mutations cause different deficiencies in RPE65 function and may lead to the 
heterogeneity observed in disease phenotypes. 
Patients assigned to active group received 1.5E11 vg in each eye (non-simultaneously) administered 
by subretinal injection. The second eye was treated 6-18 days after the first one. In order to reduce 
Assessment report

the potential for an intraocular inflammation a perioperative course of corticosteroids was given (1 
mg/kg/day prednisone up to 40 mg/day for seven days and then tapered).  
No formal dose finding study was performed. The dose finally chosen dose (1.5E11 vg in a total 
subretinal volume of 300 µL per eye) was the highest dose tested in Phase I. Surgery was performed 
under general anaesthesia with the use of a standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy.  The treatment 
is administered by means of a subretinal cannula to the subretinal space involving up to one third of 
the total retinal area, including the macula. Relevant aspects in relation to the product administration 
are the selection of the retinal area to be injected by OCT (where more viable retinal cells are exposed 
to the vector) and the avoidance the immediate vicinity of the central macula (within 2 mm from the 
foveal centre) in order to reduce potential macular complications. 
Efficacy data 
The company has presented results by group analysis and by means of bar charts to show individual 
response. 
Progress of subjects was monitored by measuring the score obtained on the mobility assessment tool 
(binocular mode) and by estimation of full field light sensitivity and visual acuity at baseline and then 
obtaining change scores at day 30, day 90, day 180 and years 1, 2 and 3 after exposure. The company 
intends to follow subjects for 15 years after exposure to study drug. 
The primary endpoint for studies 301/302 was change in score [from baseline to 1 year after exposure 
to study drug] using the company’s in-house mobility tool. Subjects used binocular vision to carry out 
the test. The tool returned ordinal scores between -1 and +6 (pass at 1 lux). At baseline, subjects 
achieved pass marks on the mobility test at between 4 and 400 ambient lux i.e. there was a wide 
range of competence. 
At 1 year, the difference (95% CI) between intervention and control [based on the ITT population] was 
+1.6 (0.72, 2.41), p<0.001 i.e. subjects exposed to study drug were better able to navigate the 
course with binocular vision. The improved ability to navigate the test course was sustained over 3 
years. 
Clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated in all subjects. The company was requested to discuss 
methods to identify those who will likely respond. No predictors of response or non-response have 
been identified from the data, including age, gender, baseline status of VA or VF, or specific genetic 
mutation. Only the presence of a sufficient number of viable cells appears the determining feature for 
the effect. It is accepted that there was not a suitable functional assessment of retinal viability and 
that the use of optical tomography, as described by the company, to measure retinal thickness as a 
guide to viability of retinal cells was probably the only option available. 
The primary endpoint was supported by the main secondary endpoints.  
Thus, for the secondary endpoint of change in mobility test score at 1 year using monocular vision with 
the first assigned eye only, the difference (95% CI) between intervention and control [based on the 
ITT population] was +1.7 (0.89, 2.52) i.e. subjects exposed to study drug were better able to navigate 
the course with monocular vision. 
For the secondary endpoint of change in change in full-field light sensitivity at 1 year for the first 
assigned eye only, the difference (95% CI) between intervention and control [based on the ITT 
population] was -2.33 (-3.44, -1.22), p<0.001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 61/97 
 
  
 
For the secondary endpoint of change in change in full-field light sensitivity at 1 year for the second 
assigned eye only, the difference (95% CI) between intervention and control [based on the ITT 
population] was -1.89 (-3.03, -0.75), p<002. 
The full-field light sensitivity results demonstrate improved retinal sensitivity to light consequent to 
exposure to study drug. 
For visual acuity, at one year after exposure to voretigene neparvovec, improvement in visual acuity of 
at least 0.3 LogMAR occurred in 11 (55%) of the first-treated eyes and 4 (20%) of the second-treated 
eyes; no one in the control group displayed such an improvement of visual acuity in either the first or 
second eye. 
Patients treated with voretigene neparvovec showed improvement in kinetic visual field area, with a 
decrease in the visual field area in the untreated group. This difference during the study was 
statistically significant for III4e but not for V4e target. It has been attributed to the reduced number of 
patients performing V4e target compared to III4e target. 
Improvement in visual function was noted within the first month of the study followed by an apparent 
stabilisation until the end of the observation period without further changes. A consistent response was 
also shown in the sensitivity analyses (mITT, PP) conducted. 
Additional expert consultation 
Question 1 
Please discuss the differences and similarities of LCA type 2 and retinitis pigmentosa (when associated 
with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 gene) at the time of study conduct and according to current 
understanding.  
Given the assertion from the Company that the understanding of the disease has evolved recently, 
please comment on the representativeness of the “studied population” to “patients with vision loss due 
to Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed 
biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells.” 
Opinion of the experts 
The experts commented that the diagnostic terms LCA2 and RP20 are imprecise, misleading and thus 
not ideal to be used in this context. For example, some publications classify RP 20 as a mild form of 
LCA2. Indeed, LCA2 and RP20 represent a phenotypic continuum of the same disease. The experts 
agreed that the preferred approach would be to use the term “retinal dystrophy caused by biallelic 
RPE65 mutations”, in order to describe the underlying biology of the disease. 
The nature and sequence of diagnostic tests in the EU varies from country to country and between 
specialist centres. The timing of genetic testing depends, among other things, on the age of onset and 
clinical presentation. Genetic testing is not currently available to patients in parts of the EU.  
The experts were of the opinion that in order to avoid the situation where patients with retinitis 
pigmentosa associated with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 gene do not receive this treatment, an 
option would be to reclassify them as LCA2 by their physicians, if Luxturna indication was limited to 
LCA2 only. However, the experts agreed that an indication given for any “retinal dystrophy caused by 
biallelic RPE65 mutation” would be a more sensible strategy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018

Question 2  
Does the expert group consider that the number of viable retinal cells measured by (OCT) is deemed a 
reliable measure in order to identify candidates to be treated?  
In this context please discuss if the following criteria are adequate to determine the presence of 
'sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means such as computerised tomography 
(OCT) and / or ophthalmoscopy.  
Must have either:  
• 
an area of retina within the posterior pole of >100μm thickness shown on OCT 
•  ≥3 disc areas of retina without atrophy or pigmentary degeneration within the posterior pole or  
• 
remaining visual field within 30-degrees of fixation as measured by III4e isopter or equivalent 
Are there more appropriate methods to determine viability of retinal cells? 
Opinion of the experts 
The experts’ view on the criteria proposed in the current labelling is that these are not optimal. It was 
suggested that the treating physician is best placed to determine if the patient has sufficient viable 
retinal cells to justify therapy.  
Experienced ophthalmologists in specialist centres would be most suitable to have an informed 
discussion with the patients about the specific pertinence of the treatment. In addition, as technology 
is moving on rapidly, the experts were reluctant to include specific tests and cut-off values in the 
labelling.  
It was stated that determining whether a patient should be treated with Luxturna should involve 
assessment of both structure and function of the retina.  
OCT could be used to assess structure but should be focused on assessment of outer retinal structures 
(outer nuclear layer, and inner segments), rather than total retinal thickness. Reference to posterior 
pole could also be removed. Full field stimulus could be used as a functional test. Electrophysiological 
tests were suggested by some experts but as they were thought not useful by other experts (floor 
effect of the signal), this proposal was not endorsed by the wider group.  
It was also noted that it may be difficult to perform OCT imaging in young children without general 
anaesthesia and a functional test could not be feasible in young children. However, such young 
patients are highly likely to have sufficient viable cells and a functional test would therefore not be 
necessary in these patients.  
Intra -operative OCT was also suggested as part of treatment administration procedure. 
Question 3 
Please discuss if it possible to decide on a “window of opportunity” for treatment based on age of 
patient, rate of progression of disease and the different phenotypes of Leber's congenital amaurosis 
and retinitis pigmentosa (when associated with mutations of the RPE65 gene) taking also into account 
that currently the durability of the Luxturna effect is not known and the possibility to repeat the 
administration has not been studied. Are there other factors that may be taken into account? 
Opinion of the experts 
The experts advised that window of opportunity is better defined by disease severity, rather than age. 
The presence of existing viable retinal cells should be the key factor to identify if a patient is likely to 
benefit from treatment.  The decision to treat should be based on individual risk/benefit assessment, 
taking into account possible safety concerns related to surgical procedure and patient’s preferences. It

was noted that all patients in clinical trials had some degree of vision loss before the intervention (i.e. 
BCVA < 20/60) but this would not have to be a prerequisite for treatment (as evidenced by FDA label).  
As the RPE cell proliferation is ongoing until 12 months of age, efficacy of earlier intervention may be 
limited (dilution of episomal transgene copies during cell division). There are also technical limitations 
of surgery in children younger than 3 years of age, although this needs to be balanced with the fact 
that earlier treatment may aid development of visual cortex. The absence of safety data in patients 
younger than four years was identified as a caveat for recommending treatment, despite the fact that 
it was recognised that children younger than 4 years could benefit based on individual assessment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of voretigene neparvovec has been evaluated in LCA2 patients with poor vision under low 
light conditions. After 1 year, the ability of patients to navigate a stylised maze (the mobility test tool) 
had improved. The primary endpoint of the study 301 was met. This effect has been maintained up to 
at least 3 years (although this is a limited follow-up period, the company intends to follow patients for 
15yrs total). Results of secondary endpoints are supportive towards the primary endpoint. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
At the time of the 05-May-2017 cut-off date, the clinical datasets consisted of at least seven years of 
cumulative Study 101 and Study 102 data, with at least four years of data following administration to 
the second eye in Study 102. For Phase 3 (Study 301 / 302), the datasets consist of at least three 
years of data for the Original Intervention subjects and at least two years of data for the Control / 
Intervention subjects. 
The clinical development program included 43 subjects across the Phase 1 (n = 12) and Phase 3 (n = 
31) studies, with 41 (95%) subjects receiving AAV2-hRPE65v2 (bilateral injection, n = 40 [98%]; 
unilateral injection, n = 1 [2%]). 
The following table presents the exposure by subject and by eye for each study: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 64/97 
 
  
 
Table 11 Vector Exposure. Subject Exposure to AAV2-hRPE65v2 
81 eyes in 41 subjects were exposed to the vector at dosages described in the above table. 
14 (34%) subjects were from outside of the U.S. (Europe, Canada, and Mexico) including 12 (29%) 
subjects from Europe (Italy, Belgium, and Netherlands). 
In Study 102, the previously un-injected contralateral eye of each enrolled subject from study 101 
received 1.5E11 vg AAV2-hRPE65v2 in a total sub-retinal volume of 300 μL. 
The mean duration between first and second injections in study 301/3021 was 8.4 ± 2.3 days (range 7 
to 14 days). The 6 to 18 day interval between administrations was used in Phase 3 to afford an 
opportunity for identification of early-emergent potential surgical complications prior to a subject 
undergoing the second procedure, and to reduce the risk of a deleterious immune response by carrying 
out the two administration procedures in a near simultaneous fashion, rather than a more widely 
spaced interval that could facilitate a prime boost response. 
Demographics of subjects 
The demographic characteristics of all subjects who were exposed to AAV2-hRPE65v2 are presented in 
the following table:

Table 12 Demographics Characteristics (All Subjects Receiving AAV2-hRPE65v2)  
Adverse events  
All subjects had at least one treatment emergent adverse event. In Phase 1 (Studies 101 and 102), 
the most frequent AEs by SOC were Infections and Infestations (n = 11 subjects, 92%), Eye Disorders 
(n = 10 subjects, 83%), and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (n = 8 subjects, 
67%). At the PT level, the most frequent events were conjunctival hyperaemia (n = 8 subjects, 67%), 
pyrexia (n = 7 subjects, 58%), and leukocytosis (n = 6 subjects, 50%). The majority of the TEAEs in 
the Phase 1 subjects were mild. 
The most frequent AEs by SOC for all 29 Phase 3 subjects through 05-May-2017 were Eye Disorders (n 
= 17 subjects, 59%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (n = 17 subjects, 59%) and Nervous System 
Disorders (n = 16 subjects, 55%). At the PT level, the most frequent events were headache (n = 13 
subjects, 45%), leukocytosis (n = 11 subjects, 38%), nausea (n = 10 subjects, 35%), and vomiting (n 
= 10 subjects, 35%). The majority of the TEAEs were mild and not related to the vector.

Adverse Events by Relationship to the Vector 
3 TEAEs of retinal deposit (verbatim subretinal precipitate), considered probably related to AAV2-
hRPE65v2 but not to the administration procedure, were reported in three subjects. Following 
subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2, a semi-circular white line (open superiorly) was observed 
in one eye each of three subjects; this finding was not observed in the contralateral eye of any of 
these subjects, who each underwent bilateral administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 within 18 days per 
protocol. The observed line (retinal deposit) was not in the area of the subretinal bleb / injection site, 
but rather was inferior to the initial injection bleb, and well below the temporal vascular arcade. The 
TEAEs of retinal deposit were a transient, asymptomatic fundoscopic finding with no observed clinical 
correlate. All of them resolved by 8 weeks. 
Adverse Events by Relationship to the Administration Procedure or Vector 
In Study 301, a total of 13 (65%) subjects in the Intervention group had at least one TEAE that was 
assessed as related to the administration procedure. The majority were Eye Disorders (n = 8 [40%] 
subjects), with cataract (n = 4 [20%] subjects through data cut-off) as the most frequently reported 
PT. 
In Study 302, a total of six Control / Intervention subjects had at least one TEAE that was assessed as 
related to the administration procedure. The majority were Eye Disorders (n = 6 [67%] subjects). 
Nausea was reported in two subjects; all other administration procedure-related events were reported 
in only one subject. 
In Study 101, ten (83%) subjects had at least one TEAE that was related to the administration 
procedure. The majority of these TEAEs were Eye Disorders (n = 9 [75%] subjects), with conjunctival 
hyperaemia (n = 8 [67%] subjects) as the most frequently reported PT. 
In Study 102, seven (64%) subjects had at least one TEAE that was related to the administration 
procedure. The majority were Eye Disorders (n = 7 [64%] subjects), with dellen (n = 3 [27%] 
subjects) as the most frequently reported PT. 
In the addendum with a revised cut-off date 05 May 2017, the company reports on 9 new events. five 
events were considered related to the administration procedure, including one Phase 1 event (cataract) 
and four Phase 3 events (cataract and eyelid ptosis). 
Related adverse events are summarised in the following table:

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Ocular TEAEs are considered events of special interest and are summarised in the following table: 
Table 14 Summary of Ocular TEAEs – All Studies – Data Cut-Off 05-May-2017 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 70/97 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The most common ocular AEs in the clinical program were conjunctival hyperaemia (22%), cataract 
(22%), and intraocular pressure increased (20%). The majority of ocular events were related to the 
administration procedure; three events of retinal deposits were related to the vector and resolved with 
minimal or no intervention and without sequelae. 
Cataract 
As of the data cut-off, there have been a total of 16 events of cataract reported in nine of 41 (22%) 
subjects in the clinical program. Overall, 20% of the 81 injected eyes developed cataract progression 
or formation. 
Retinal tears 
4/81 (5%) eyes in the clinical program had a retinal tear. Retinal tears were observed and repaired by 
the surgeon with laserpexy (fixation procedure) during the vector administration procedures in one 
Phase 1 subject and three Phase 3 subjects. Three events were mild in intensity, one was moderate, 
and all resolved with no sequelae. 
Macular holes 
3 subjects developed macular holes in the days after surgery, one is on-going and two are resolved. 
Foveal dehiscence 
One subject experienced foveal dehiscence during the surgical procedure and that resolved without 
intervention by Day 14. 
Eyelid ptosis 
1 subject was reported with mild ptosis of the left eye beginning 1121 days after the day of the first 
eye injection. The event was considered to be unrelated to the vector and related to the administration 
procedure and was ongoing (no change) at the time of the data cut-off. 
Optical coherence tomography 
Optical coherence tomography images were captured using two different machines over the clinical 
program: initially using the Stratus machine and eventually using the more sensitive Heidelberg 
apparatus. 
Optical coherence tomography is challenging due to the common presence of nystagmus. Although 
recent spectral domain OCT apparatus have built in eye tracking, the amplitude and frequency of 
nystagmus is often beyond the capability of the apparatus to maintain capture. This may detrimentally 
affect the resolution quality of the images captured. 
In Study 101, OCT images were captured using the Stratus apparatus. For Study 102, both types of 
OCT instruments were used, presenting additional limitations for longitudinal review of OCT images 
from the Study 102 population. There was no specific pattern observed in the OCT findings. 
In the Phase 3 studies, spectral domain OCT images were captured using the Heidelberg apparatus. 
Both eyes of the Intervention subjects had a decrease in mean foveal thickness after administration; 
while an increase was observed in subsequent visits, mean foveal thickness levels did not return to 
Baseline for either eye of the Intervention subjects. Control group changes were minimal for both eyes.

Figure 14 Heidelberg Retina Tomography: Change in Foveal Thickness (Microns) for Both 
Eyes (301+302, n=29) 
The decrease in foveal thickness could be attributed to decreased length of the outer segments 
following bleb formation and retinal detachment, with delayed elongation after re-attachment. 
While a statistically significant difference was observed, it is not clear whether the mean decrease of 
13.1 microns in the first injected eye of the Intervention group subjects is clinically relevant and / or 
greater than the expected variability for this anatomical assessment, particularly in individuals with 
RPE65 mutations and considering variations in precise anatomical locations from visit to visit; the 
range of change observed for this outcome at Year 1 was -87 to 183 microns for the Intervention 
group and -13 to 15 for the Control group. 
Time domain OCT images were captured using the Stratus apparatus (Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia [CHOP] site only). No significant difference between the Intervention or Control subjects 
was observed by Stratus measures of foveal thickness at Year 1. The minimal changes observed for 
both groups may be due to the variability in fixation. 
Overall, it was not clear whether the observed decreases were clinically relevant and/or greater than 
the expected test-retest variability for individuals with RPE65 mutations, particularly when taking 
variations in precise anatomical locations from visit to visit into consideration; however, in looking 
across data for all subjects from injection baseline to Year 1 post administration, one can appreciate 
that, on average, the reduction in foveal thickness observed at Day 30 post administration using 
Heidelberg OCT (range: -20.1 to -34.3 microns) appeared to be temporary, with a return to injection 
Baseline levels observed by Year 1. These findings may represent a reversible disruption of the outer 
segments of the retina observed during the postoperative period.

Serious Adverse Events 
Through the 05-May-2017 data cut-off, 14 SAEs have been reported in nine subjects in the clinical 
program (Table 16): 
Table 15 Serious Adverse Events by SOC and PT – All Studies, Data Cut-Off 05-May-2017 
Most serious adverse events were unrelated to participation in the clinical studies and none were 
related to AAV2-hRPE65v2; one serious TEAE (intraocular pressure increased) was reported as a result 
of treatment for endophthalmitis that led to elevated intraocular pressure, with subsequent optic 
atrophy, and one serious TEAE (retinal disorder [loss of foveal function]) was assessed as probably 
related to the administration procedure.

Immunological events 
Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses 
Data have not shown any specific pattern or clinical correlates. There was substantial subject-to-
subject variability in anti-AAV2 titre both prior to and following vector administration. The clinical 
significance of the changes in anti- AAV2 titre following vector administration is unknown. 
No clinical inflammatory response to the investigational product has been observed and no dose 
limiting toxicity was seen in the clinical program. 
Vector Shedding Data 
For the Original Intervention subjects: 
• 
all samples tested were negative in 11 subjects 
•  8 subjects had only positive tear samples 
•  1 subject had only positive serum samples 
•  1 subject had both positive tear and serum samples 
• 
In 6 subjects, there was only one positive sample from tears at Day 1 post injection 
•  2 subjects tested positive for tears up to day 10 after the first eye administration.  
• 
In both subjects with detectable vector in serum, levels were low (from 13 to 68 copies) and 
only detectable up to Day 3 following each injection. 
In Control / Intervention subjects: 
• 
all samples tested were negative in 4 subjects 
•  4 subjects had only positive tear samples  
•  1 subject had both positive tear and serum samples.  
• 
• 
Positive tear / serum samples were found up to Day 14.  
In the one Control / Intervention subject with detectable vector in serum, the levels were low 
(ranging from 21 to 24 copies) and only detectable up to Day 3B. 
Laboratory findings 
Routine laboratory safety 
No pattern of change detected. 
Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses 
Data collection for the analysis of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses ceased prior to the 
time period of this addendum. More specifically, for Study 102 subjects, cell-mediated and humoral 
immune responses were no longer assessed following transfer to the LTFU protocol while for Study 
301, these responses were not assessed after Year 1B.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
41 subjects aged 4 to 45 years, male and female, received AAV2-hRPE65v2 (bilateral injection, n = 40 
[98%]; unilateral injection, n = 1 [2%]). All subjects had a confirmed molecular diagnosis of an RPE65 
gene mutation. The small number of subjects and consequent limited experience of exposure to study 
drug is understood in the context of a rare disease.  
The safety data were collected up to the revised cut-off date (5-May-2017), 
The safety data evaluated correspond to an initial 1 year of observation and to a long-term phase of 
observation (up to 4-7 years for phase 1 subjects and up to 2-3 years for phase 3 subjects). Although 
the period of long term follow-up is acceptable, more data with longer periods could raise new safety 
information or add information that better clarifies the uncertainties about the clinical significance of 
some the safety findings.  
It should be mentioned that there is a significant heterogeneity of the target population due to 
different subtypes of the mutation and different clinical diseases associated to the mutation, that could 
have impact on the evolution and clinical features of the disease that could influence the benefit/risk 
profile of the treatment. With the current data, it seems that there is no association between mutation 
type and baseline disease state, treatment response and apparent risk of ocular events and that the 
overall benefit/risk profile of voretigene neparvovec cannot be predicted a priori by assessment of 
mutation subtype. 
Overall, available safety data from the voretigene neparvovec clinical program demonstrate that the 
intervention was generally well tolerated. 
All subjects (100%) reported at least one AE while on study. Most adverse events were mild and most 
resolved without sequalae, but there were eight serious AEs in seven subjects and also a few AEs or 
SAEs that resolved with sequalae. 
The most frequent AEs by SOC for all 29 Phase 3 subjects during the first year post injection were 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (n = 17 subjects, 59%), Eye Disorders (n = 16 subjects, 55%), and Nervous 
System Disorders (n = 16 subjects, 55%). At the PT level, the most frequent events were headache (n 
= 13 subjects, 45%), leukocytosis (n = 11 subjects, 38%), nausea (n = 10 subjects, 35%), and 
vomiting (n = 10 subjects, 35%). Most of them, except of Eye Disorders were not related to the vector 
or to the administration procedure.  
69% of subjects reported TEAEs considered related to the administration procedure and of special 
concern are that two of them were SAEs (permanent loss of foveal function and intraocular pressure 
increase Grade 4) with clinical relevance. 
Most of the ocular TEAEs were known complications of intraocular surgery and occurred during the 
initial year of post-administration follow-up; these were: increased intraocular pressure, retinal tear, 
macular hole, cataract, and inflammation and / or infection of the eye post-administration. 
The only TEAEs that were considered related to AAV2-hRPE65v2 were 3 TEAEs of retinal deposit 
(probably related to AAV2-hRPE65v2 but not to the administration procedure); they were reported in 
three subjects and were transient, asymptomatic fundoscopic findings with no observed clinical 
correlate; all resolved by 8 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 75/97 
 
  
 
Another aspect that should be considered is the expertise and training of the sites and personnel 
participating in the clinical program that could not be extrapolated to other sites and personnel. In the 
Risk Management Plan of the product, some minimisation measures have been proposed for the risks 
related with the administration procedure including the distribution through centres of excellence who 
have received adequate training on use of product and an educational programme with multiple 
measures. This seems reasonable, but the implementation of the proposal could be complex due to 
Health Management Systems quite different from country to country although the minimum level of 
adequate specific training and standardization seems that could be reached with the proposed 
educational programme.   
Although the changes in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses seem to be minimal, the 
clinical significance is not clear and this creates an uncertainty for the safety assessment of voretigene 
neparvovec. 
The uncertainties about immune responses could have higher weight if in the future repeat 
administration of voretigene neparvovec is necessary to treat an individual eye, as currently there are 
no available data for this repeated administration. 
Longer follow-up and a higher number of patients exposed to voretigene neparvovec will help to better 
outline the safety profile of the new treatment and its real benefit for the target population. The 
ongoing follow-up for patients included in the clinical program and the registry planned to collect long 
term safety data in patients treated with voretigene neparvovec included as pharmacovigilance 
activities in the Risk Management Plan was deemed to be appropriate. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The limited experience of exposure to study drug is understood in the context of a rare disease. The 
company intends to follow-up subjects exposed to study drug for 15 years. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

Conclusion 
The  CHMP,  CAT  and  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  1.4  (dated  18  September  2018)  is 
acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  and  CAT  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the 
applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The IBD is 19/12/2017. The applicant did request 
international harmonisation of the PSUR cycle by using the forthcoming Data Lock Point 24/07/2007 
(data harmonised with DIBD). 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that voretigene neparvovec has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CHMP and CAT, based on the available data, consider voretigene neparvovec to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The company has requested an exemption from printing the statement ‘Keep out of the sight and 
reach of children’ on the pouch label and on the outer carton, based on Art. 63(3) which was accepted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 82/97 
 
  
 
by the QRD Group. The proposed omission of the warning for children will have no adverse impact on 
the correct administration safety of the product based on the fact that the product will be supplied to a 
limited number of specialised clinical centres and excluded handled by healthcare professionals. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request for an exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC in relation to 
severe problems in respect of the availability of the medicinal product has been submitted by the 
applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The company has submitted a request to use the US vial label (for the concentrate and solvent) in 
Europe because of manufacturing issues. This will be a temporary measure until Q1 2020.  
Luxturna was approved in the US in December 2017. Only a few thousand people worldwide are 
affected, and there are no other existing therapies for this rare blinding condition. In Europe, orphan 
medicinal designation for Leber congenital amaurosis was granted in April 2012 (EU/3/12/981) and for 
treatment of retinitis pigmentosa in July 2015 (EU/3/15/1518).  
For approximately the first year following the anticipated EC approval of voretigene neparvovec in the 
fourth quarter of 2018, drug supply for Europe will be severely limited due to long manufacturing lead 
times. 
Given the rarity of the disease, the manufacturing batch size is small, due to the small number of 
patients and the dose given. Only a very limited amount of the US drug product is available until early 
2020, when the first batches intended for the European market are manufactured. The applicant 
anticipates providing access to approximately 80-90 patients by the end of 2019. This request to use 
the US labelled vial is therefore temporary in nature, and will be extremely limited in scope. Alternative 
labelling of the frozen vial (i.e. frozen vials are thawed to ambient temperature, re-labelled, and then 
refrozen.) is not possible. This would require the Applicant to qualify this thawing process prior to 
implementation. Exceptionally, use of the currently available vials as labelled for the US market, is the 
most direct pathway to supply Europe for a short temporary timeframe until Q1 2020. 
Because of the complexity of this request, this was assessed by the QRD Group.  
Based on the above arguments, the QRD members agreed to have the vial marketed with the US label 
with the following comments: 
- Distribution of the US pack in the EU should be accompanied by a communication letter informing 
HCPs about the US vials and its differences compared to the EU vial label, as follow: 
- Clarification on what does the sentence ‘Rx only’ means and why it appears on the label (only 
applicable to US market) 
- To re-emphasise in particular the need for dilution before use as the Ph. Form ‘concentrate’ is 
not mentioned on the US pack and the dilution step is not prominent enough.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group.

2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. In addition, it is a biological 
product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2 and retinitis pigmentosa Type 20 are diseases of the eye inherited 
in an autosomal recessive manner. Subjects may progressively lose visual acuity and visual fields from 
birth; the rate of loss accelerates from the late teenage years. Night blindness is a feature of the 
condition.  
Symptoms may become evident from 2 – 3 months of age. There is progressive, profound reduction of 
visual acuity, concentric reduction of visual fields, night blindness and nystagmus. Subjects have great 
difficulty performing activities of daily living, even under normal daytime lighting conditions. Subjects 
may be blind by young adulthood. Subjects with this condition have a deficiency of activity of all-trans-
retinyl isomerase, one of the enzymes involved in the biochemistry of light capture by the cells of the 
retina. All-trans-retinyl isomerase is encoded by the RPE65 gene. Subjects have mutations in the 
RPE65 gene. 
Luxturna is a gene therapy that delivers hRPE65 to the cells of the retina. Once installed in to a 
patient, expression of the gene product of hRPE65, all-trans-retinyl isomerase, will permit subjects to 
regenerate intra-ocular 11-cis-retinal and so lead to improvement in the ability to detect light. 
In the course of the MAA evaluation it became apparent that for a gene therapy product like luxturna, 
an indication based on a molecular/genetic diagnosis would be more appropriate than an indication 
based on clinical classification/description. Consequently, the indication was revised to “inherited 
retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations “ as this allows for more precise 
definition of the underlying biology of the disease and embraces different clinical descriptions including 
LCA and retinitis pigmentosa, while  clearly indicating only the specific mutation that is amenable to 
therapy with Luxturna. This approach was endorsed by the convened Expert Group meeting (see 
section 2.5.3).   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 84/97 
 
  
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is not a licenced medicinal product for inherited retinal dystrophy owing to biallelic RPE 65 
mutations / medical management is supportive. 
Surgical devices are available for subjects who meet clinical requirements: either the Argus® II Retinal 
Prosthesis System or the Alpha AMS Retina Implant AG. The devices have variable and limited clinical 
efficacy. There is an unmet clinical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The company conducted exploratory clinical studies 101 and 102 in 11 subjects with Leber’s congential 
amaurosis type 2 in order to gain experience with product and in order to develop its in-house mobility 
tool (a test of vision function). These studies were open label, uncontrolled and non-randomised. 
The main clinical study was study 301/302. This study was open-label, randomised and controlled. 29 
subjects with Leber’s congential amaurosis type 2 were recruited; 20 subjects were exposed to study 
drug whilst 9 subjects entered a control arm and were followed for one year before being exposed to 
study drug i.e. delayed entry design. 
Viable retinal cells need to be present for Luxturna to exert an effect. Thus, participants in the Phase 
III study had to be shown to have sufficient viable retinal cells defined for the purpose of the study as 
an area of retina within the posterior pole of >100 µm thickness as determined by optical coherence 
tomography. In the opinion of the principal investigators (retinal surgeons) for the company, this was 
the minimum retinal thickness required in order to safely perform the administration procedure; retinal 
thickness was chosen as the best available surrogate for retinal viability in the absence of a suitable 
test to directly measure viability. 
Outcome as assessed by a mobility test tool (developed in-house by the company) has been used as 
the primary endpoint of study 301/302. The mobility test tool is a clinic-based clinician-reported 
outcome assessment tool. Subjects are asked to navigate between start and finish in a stylised 
obstacle course at ambient light set at one constant level between 400 lux and 1 lux during each 
attempt. The main analysis was of binocular navigation of the test layout. 
Subjects are marked as either 'pass' or 'fail'; a 'pass' mark requires the subject to complete the task 
within 180 secs and to 'fail to navigate' 3 or less obstacles. A 'pass' mark at 1 lux is the highest 
possible score. 
At baseline, subjects scored pass marks in the mobility test at between 4 and 400 ambient lux i.e. 
there was much variation in competence at baseline. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The evaluation of efficacy mainly relies on the effect on vision under low light conditions, as nyctalopia 
(an abnormal inability to see in dim light) represents one of the key clinical features of the disease. 
After 1 year the patients treated with voretigene neparvovec improved, with respect to baseline 
performance and to controls, and were able to better navigate an indoor stylised course at lower 
ambient light level. This was reflected in their results on the used navigation tool score. Control un-
injected patients did not change their mean score. A difference of 1.6 score between groups was 
observed. This MT change score difference was statistically significant (p= 0.001). For the ITT 
population, 13 of 21 (62%) subjects in the Intervention group passed at 1 lux (maximum score of 6) 
at Year 1 versus 0/10 in the Control group. This magnitude of change was also observed when each 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 85/97 
 
  
eye was considered separately. 
The effect has been maintained for up to 3 years. 
The meaningful aspect of health that is addressed by the mobility test is “ambulatory vision” or how 
the individual uses vision to navigate around obstacles and from place to place. Thus, in patients with 
RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, nyctalopia is a hallmark of the disease and vision, 
particularly in dim light, is profoundly impaired and so limits, or prevents, the ability to perform 
multiple activities that are part of normal life, particularly those that take place in low illuminance 
environments. This impairment is meaningful to the patient, something the patient cares about, and in 
the context of a progressive, degenerative disease, a treatment that improves or prevents worsening is 
viewed as beneficial. 
Secondary endpoints of full field sensitivity of the retina, monocular navigation of the mobility test 
layout and change in visual acuity are generally supportive towards the primary endpoint as measured 
by the mobility test tool of the company. Outcomes of the primary endpoint for subjects also appear to 
be confirmed by post-test interviews conducted with subjects regarding ability to function in a home 
setting. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although it is considered that the mobility test tool has notable deficiencies such as a broad ceiling 
effect that will hamper follow-up, the tool is considered to be a reasonable attempt to record visual 
function under a variety of conditions. Nonetheless, simply watching videos of subjects undergoing the 
mobility test before and after exposure to Luxturna convinces of clinical efficacy without recourse to 
review scores of the mobility test. It is noted that the company has decided not to develop the mobility 
tool further. 
There are technical difficulties in carrying out retinal surgery in subjects under the age of 3yrs and so 
the company did not include subjects younger than 3 years in the clinical studies.  
Neither age of the subject nor genotype were able to identify subjects who would or would not respond 
to exposure to Luxturna, presumably as a result of the heterogeneity of presentation and progress of 
the disease. 
Long-term efficacy beyond 3 years after exposure to Luxturna has not yet been established and so 
measurements of efficacy should be recorded beyond 3 years after exposure to the current product in 
order to substantiate long-term maintenance of clinical effect. 
In addition, questions related to the need for additional re-treatments in cases of loss of effect or the 
administration of multiple injections in order to widen the target retinal area would be of interest to 
address. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Luxturna is delivered to the sub-retinal space of the eye by a surgical procedure. Unfavourable effects 
were mostly confined to the eye. 
Three subjects showed evidence of retinal deposit after exposure to Luxturna. These deposits were 
considered related to study drug and were transient, asymptomatic fundoscopic findings with no 
observed clinical correlate; all resolved by 8 weeks. 
Most of the ocular treatment-emergent adverse events were known complications of intraocular 
surgery and occurred during the initial year of post-administration follow-up; these were: increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 86/97 
 
  
intraocular pressure, retinal tear, macular hole, cataract, foveal dehiscence, retinal hemorrhage and 
inflammation and / or infection of the eye post-administration. These events might have long-term 
consequences, especially if they were left untreated. The company has submitted published data that 
are comparable to the complications of pars plana eye surgery reported for the current studies. 
Through the data cut-off, eight serious TEAEs in seven subjects have been reported in the clinical 
program. Most were unrelated to participation in the clinical studies and none were related to AAV2-
hRPE65v2; one subject experienced a SAE (significant and permanent loss of foveal function) related 
to the administration procedure, and one subject reported a SAE (intraocular pressure increased grade 
4) related to treatment (periocular steroid) for an AE (endophthalmitis) that was related to the 
administration procedure. These two SAEs took place in subjects older than 18. 
In Phase III, there were changes in the foveal thickness for same patients after drug administration 
that in some cases returned to baseline levels after 1 Year and not in others.   
In Phase III, the three TEAEs of retinal deposit and the three TEAEs of retinal tear all occurred in 
subjects under the age of 18 (15% vs. 0%). The incidence of TEAEs related to the administration 
procedure in Phase 3 was double for subjects aged ≥ 18 years (100%) compared to subjects aged < 
18 years (50%). This difference was especially evident in the Eye Disorders, which showed a higher 
incidence of AEs related to the administration procedure in older subjects (78%) than in younger 
subjects (30%). No marked differences were observed for TEAEs by severity. 
There were isolated changes in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and also some cases 
of positive results (low levels and transient) for vector shedding in tears and/or serum. 
Update July 2018: the company reports on 4 instances of retinal tear and one serious adverse event of 
retinal detachment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The small population of only 41 subjects exposed in total with follow-up for most being only up to 3 
years inevitably means that knowledge of unfavourable effects is much limited. This may be addressed 
by each subject entering into a 15-year follow-up programme, as proposed by the company. 
The open-label nature of study 301/302 inevitably means that the true magnitude of benefit may be 
smaller than that claimed by the company.  
There was heterogeneity of the target population (perhaps owing to subjects having different 
mutations of the RPE65 gene) reflected in variation of clinical features of the disease and that may 
affect the benefit / risk profile of the treatment in each recipient. 
Adverse events not so far reported may become apparent as more subjects are exposed to the current 
product. Similarly, the frequency of adverse events now reported may be revised as there is more 
experience of use of the current product. 
It is not known if the expertise and training of personnel at the sites in the clinical programme will be 
matched by sites recruited in the post-licensing phase.  
Information on exposure to children under 3 years old is missing. 
Although the changes in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses seem to be minimal and 
the levels of vector shedding seem to be low and transient (positive findings mainly in tears), the 
clinical significance is not clear.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700911/2018 
Page 87/97 
 
  
The uncertainties about immune responses could have higher weight if in the future repeat 
administration of voretigene neparvovec is necessary to treat an individual eye, as currently there are 
no available data for this repeated administration.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Increased sensitivity of the retina to light is highly relevant and highly important to subjects with 
inherited retinal dystrophy, a condition where an unmet clinical need exists. The consequence of 
improved functional vision may be expected to much enhance quality of life for these subjects. 
Transient retinal pigment formation without clinical consequence and that resolves within 8 weeks is 
considered to be an unfavourable effect, which is outbalanced by the positive effects of the treatment. 
The complications of pars plana eye surgery reported by the company are recognised complications of 
such surgery and are inevitable. These are important unfavourable effects. Though not to be taken 
lightly, it is usual practice for risks of surgery to be explained to the subject prior to surgery so that the 
subject may develop his / her own risk assessment. The complications of surgery also reflect the 
competence of the surgeon; it is intended that such surgery is done by a skilled surgeon. In these 
contexts, the unfavourable effects of surgery are considered to be manageable. 
More data with longer periods could raise new safety information or add information that better 
clarifies the uncertainties about the clinical significance of some the safety findings. An update of 
safety data may be of relevance to better characterise the safety profile of voretigene neparvovec. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical benefit of improved detection of light far outweighs the complications of eye surgery.  
The benefit/risk balance is currently positive for subjects with a diagnosis of inherited retinal dystrophy 
owing to biallelic RPE 65 mutations.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
It is acknowledged that the number of patients with biallelic RPE 65 mutations treated with Luxturna is 
small, and it may not fully cover the range of phenotypic expression (and probably the nomenclature 
of diagnosed conditions) in terms of severity of the visual function loss that may be observed in clinical 
practice. Nevertheless, this is a gene therapy product which is designed to restore a specific loss of 
function caused by single gene (RPE 65) mutation. The clinical data reflects that the essential pre-
requisite for the product to work is the existence of ‘sufficient viable retinal cells’. The study included 
patients with significant visual function loss (visual acuity ≤20/60 and/or visual field ≤ 20 degrees for 
both eyes) and provided adequate evidence of efficacy in this group. It is further acknowledged that 
based on the understanding of the mechanism, it is highly likely to benefit patients with lesser visual 
function loss as these patients will have more viable retinal cells. Any limitation to use in patients with 
better preserved visual function will be based on limitations of long-term safety data and not owing to 
uncertainties on efficacy. Given this understanding it was not considered appropriate to restrict the use 
of the gene therapy based on extent / pattern of visual loss.

Based on the above considerations, a limitation based on specific phenotypic types was not considered 
appropriate. However, further studies that would be recommended are: 
• 
Long-term follow-up of recipients of Luxturna to establish continuing efficacy and safety. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Luxturna is positive in the agreed indication. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Luxturna is favourable in 
the following indication: 
Luxturna is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited 
retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal 
cells.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior  to  launch  of  LUXTURNA  in  each  Member  State  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  must 
agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  programme,  including  communication  media, 
distribution  modalities,  and  any  other  aspects  of  the  programme,  with  the  National  Competent 
Authority (NCA).  
The  MAH  shall  ensure  that  in  each  Member  State  (MS)  where  LUXTURNA  is  marketed,  the  product is 
distributed  through  treatment  centres  where  qualified  staff  (i.e.  vitreoretinal  surgeons  and 
pharmacists)  have  participated  in  the  mandatory  educational  program  about  use  of  the  product  and 
pharmacy  training,  in  order  to  ensure  LUXTURNA  correct  use  so  as  to  minimise  the  risks  associated 
with  its  administration  and  /  or  the  administration  procedure  (increased  intraocular  pressure,  retinal 
tear,  macular  disorders,  cataract,  intraocular  inflammation  and/or  infection  related  to  the  procedure 
and retinal detachment, third party transmission).

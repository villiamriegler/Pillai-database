SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Pergoveris 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile has to 
be closely monitored since there are grounds for suspecting 
significant off-label use of Pergoveris in Assisted 
Reproductive Technology (ART) for women who do not 
have severe LH and FSH deficiency, and a number of issues 
are still required monitoring in the risk management plan, 
including potential side effects with long latency. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Pergoveris, 
which requires submission of three yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

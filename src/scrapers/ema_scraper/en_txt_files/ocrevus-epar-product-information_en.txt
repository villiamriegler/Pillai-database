PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for solution for infusion   
Clear to slightly opalescent, and colourless to pale brown solution.   
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis 
(RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1).  
Ocrevus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features 
characteristic of inflammatory activity (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialised physicians experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of neurological conditions and who have access to appropriate medical support to 
manage severe reactions such as serious infusion-related reactions (IRRs). 
Premedication for infusion-related reactions  
The following two premedications must be administered prior to each ocrelizumab infusion to reduce 
the frequency and severity of IRRs (see section 4.4 for additional steps to reduce IRRs): 
• 
100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) approximately 30 minutes prior to 
each infusion; 
antihistamine approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion; 
• 
In addition, premedication with an antipyretic (e.g., paracetamol) may also be considered 
approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion. 
Posology  
Initial dose 
The initial 600 mg dose is administered as two separate intravenous infusions; first as a 300 mg 
infusion, followed 2 weeks later by a second 300 mg infusion (see Table 1).   
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subsequent doses   
Subsequent doses of ocrelizumab thereafter are administered as a single 600 mg intravenous infusion 
every 6 months (see Table 1). The first subsequent dose of 600 mg should be administered six months 
after the first infusion of the initial dose.  
A minimum interval of 5 months should be maintained between each dose of ocrelizumab.   
Infusion adjustments in case of IRRs  
Life-threatening IRRs   
If there are signs of a life threatening or disabling IRR during an infusion, such as acute 
hypersensitivity or acute respiratory distress syndrome, the infusion must be stopped immediately and 
the patient should receive appropriate treatment. The infusion must be permanently discontinued in 
these patients (see section 4.3). 
Severe IRRs 
If a patient experiences a severe IRR (such as dyspnea) or a complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain 
symptoms, the infusion should be interrupted immediately, and the patient should receive symptomatic 
treatment. The infusion should be restarted only after all symptoms have resolved. The initial infusion 
rate at restart should be half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the reaction. No infusion 
adjustment is necessary for subsequent new infusions, unless the patient experiences an IRR. 
Mild to moderate IRRs 
If a patient experiences a mild to moderate IRR (e.g., headache), the infusion rate should be reduced to 
half the rate at the onset of the event.  This reduced rate should be maintained for at least 30 minutes. 
If tolerated, the infusion rate may then be increased according to the patient’s initial infusion rate. No 
infusion adjustment is necessary for subsequent new infusions, unless the patient experiences an IRR. 
Dose modifications during treatment 
The above examples of dose interruption and slowing (for mild/moderate and severe IRRs) will result 
in a change in the infusion rate and increase the total duration of the infusion, but not the total dose. 
No dose reductions are recommended. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If an infusion is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible; do not wait until the next 
planned dose. The treatment interval of 6 months (with a minimum of 5 months) should be maintained 
between doses (see Table 1). 
Special populations  
Adults over 55 years old and elderly population  
Based on the limited data available (see section 5.1 and section 5.2), no posology adjustment is needed 
in patients over 55 years of age. Patients enrolled in the ongoing clinical trials continue to be dosed 
with 600 mg ocrelizumab every six months after they become 55 years and older. 
Renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with renal impairment has not been formally 
studied. Patients with mild renal impairment were included in clinical trials. There is no experience in 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody and 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cleared via catabolism (i.e. breakdown into peptides and amino acids), and a dose adjustment is not 
expected to be required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).   
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with hepatic impairment has not been formally 
studied.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment were included in clinical trials. There is no experience 
in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody and 
cleared via catabolism (rather than hepatic metabolism), and a dose adjustment is not expected to be 
required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).   
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been 
established. No data are available.   
Method of administration  
After dilution, treatment is administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line. Infusions 
should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. 
If patients did not experience a serious infusion-related reaction (IRR) with any previous ocrelizumab 
infusion, a shorter (2-hour) infusion can be administered for subsequent doses (Table 1, Option 2).

Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)  
Ocrelizumab is associated with IRRs, which may be related to cytokine release and/or other chemical 
mediators.   
Symptoms of IRRs may occur during any ocrelizumab infusion, but have been more frequently 
reported during the first infusion. IRRs can occur within 24 hours of the infusion (see section 4.8). 
These reactions may present as pruritus, rash, urticaria, erythema, throat irritation, oropharyngeal pain, 
dyspnoea, pharyngeal or laryngeal oedema, flushing, hypotension, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, 
dizziness, nausea, tachycardia and anaphylaxis.    
Before the infusion 
Management of severe reactions 
Appropriate resources for the management of severe reactions such as serious IRR, hypersensitivity 
reactions and/or anaphylactic reactions should be available. 
Hypotension 
As a symptom of IRR, hypotension may occur during infusions. Therefore, withholding of 
antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each infusion. 
Patients with a history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association III & IV) were not 
studied.   
Premedication 
Patients must receive premedication to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs (see section 4.2). 
During the infusion  
The following measures need to be taken for patients who experience severe pulmonary symptoms, 
such as bronchospasm or asthma exacerbation:  
• 
• 
• 
their infusion must be interrupted immediately and permanently; 
symptomatic treatment must be administered; 
the patient must be monitored until the pulmonary symptoms have resolved because initial 
improvement of clinical symptoms could be followed by deterioration. 
Hypersensitivity may be difficult to distinguish from an IRR in terms of symptoms. If a 
hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion, the infusion must be stopped immediately and 
permanently (see ‘Hypersensitivity reactions’ below).    
After the infusion  
Patients should be observed for at least one hour after the completion of the infusion for any symptom 
of IRR.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physicians should alert patients that an IRR can occur within 24 hours of infusion. 
For guidance regarding infusion adjustments in case of IRR, see section 4.2. 
Hypersensitivity reactions   
A hypersensitivity reaction could also occur (acute allergic reaction to medicinal product). Type 1 
acute hypersensitivity reactions (IgE-mediated) may be clinically indistinguishable from IRR 
symptoms. 
A hypersensitivity reaction may present during any infusion, although typically would not present 
during the first infusion. For subsequent infusions, more severe symptoms than previously 
experienced, or new severe symptoms, should prompt consideration of a potential hypersensitivity 
reaction. Patients with known IgE mediated hypersensitivity to ocrelizumab must not be treated (see 
section 4.3).   
Infection  
Administration of ocrelizumab must be delayed in patients with an active infection until the infection 
is resolved. 
It is recommended to verify the patient’s immune status before dosing since severely 
immunocompromised patients (e.g., with lymphopenia, neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) should 
not be treated (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
The overall proportion of patients experiencing a serious infection was similar to comparators (see 
section 4.8). The frequency of grade 4 (life-threatening) and grade 5 (fatal) infections was low in all 
treatment groups, but in PPMS it was higher with ocrelizumab compared with placebo for life-
threatening (1.6% vs 0.4%) and fatal (0.6% vs 0%) infections. All life-threatening infections resolved 
without discontinuing ocrelizumab. 
In PPMS, patients with swallowing difficulties are at a higher risk of aspiration pneumonia. Treatment 
with ocrelizumab may further increase the risk of severe pneumonia in these patients. Physicians 
should take prompt action for patients presenting with pneumonia.  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
John Cunningham virus (JCV) infection resulting in PML has been observed very rarely in patients 
treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, including ocrelizumab, and mostly associated with risk factors 
(patient population e.g., lymphopenia, advanced age, polytherapy with immunosuppressants). 
Physicians should be vigilant for the early signs and symptoms of PML, which can include any new 
onset, or worsening of neurological signs or symptoms, as these can be similar to MS disease. 
If PML is suspected, dosing with ocrelizumab must be withheld. Evaluation including Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan preferably with contrast (compared with pre-treatment MRI), 
confirmatory cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) testing for JCV Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and repeat 
neurological assessments, should be considered. If PML is confirmed, treatment must be discontinued 
permanently. 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure 
and death, has been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies.   
HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment as per local 
guidelines. Patients with active HBV (i.e. an active infection confirmed by positive results for HBsAg 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and anti HB testing) should not be treated with ocrelizumab (see section 4.3). Patients with positive 
serology (i.e. negative for HBsAg and positive for HB core antibody (HBcAb +); carriers of HBV 
(positive for surface antigen, HBsAg+) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment 
and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B 
reactivation. 
Late neutropenia 
Cases of late onset of neutropenia have been reported at least 4 weeks after the latest ocrelizumab 
infusion (see section 4.8). Although some cases were Grade 3 or 4, the majority of the cases were 
Grade 1 or 2. In patients with signs and symptoms of infection, measurement of blood neutrophils is 
recommended. 
Malignancies 
An increased number of malignancies (including breast cancers) have been observed in clinical trials 
in patients treated with ocrelizumab, compared to control groups. The incidence was within the 
background rate expected for an MS population. Patients with a known active malignancy should not 
be treated with ocrelizumab (see section 4.3). Individual benefit risk should be considered in patients 
with known risk factors for malignancies and in patients who are being actively monitored for 
recurrence of malignancy. Patients should follow standard breast cancer screening per local guidelines.  
In the controlled period of the clinical trials, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers was low and 
there was no imbalance between treatment groups. An increase in incidence was observed between 
years 3 and 4 of treatment due to basal cell carcinoma, which was not observed in subsequent years. 
The incidence was within the background rate expected for an MS population. 
Treatment of severely immunocompromised patients  
Patients in a severely immunocompromised state must not be treated until the condition resolves (see 
section 4.3). 
In other auto-immune conditions, use of ocrelizumab concomitantly with immunosuppressants (e.g., 
chronic corticosteroids, non-biologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
[DMARDS], mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine) resulted in an increase of 
serious infections, including opportunistic infections. Infections included and were not limited to 
atypical pneumonia and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, varicella pneumonia, tuberculosis, 
histoplasmosis. In rare cases, some of these infections were fatal. An exploratory analysis identified 
the following factors associated with risk of serious infections: higher doses of ocrelizumab than 
recommended in MS, other comorbidities, and chronic use of immunosuppressants/corticosteroids. 
It is not recommended to use other immunosuppressives concomitantly with ocrelizumab except 
corticosteroids for symptomatic treatment of relapses. Knowledge is limited as to whether concomitant 
steroid use for symptomatic treatment of relapses is associated with an increased risk of infections in 
clinical practice. In the ocrelizumab MS pivotal studies, the administration of corticosteroids for the 
treatment of relapse was not associated with an increased risk of serious infection. 
When initiating ocrelizumab after an immunosuppressive therapy or initiating an immunosuppressive 
therapy after ocrelizumab, the potential for overlapping pharmacodynamic effects should be taken into 
consideration (see section 5.1). Caution should be exercised when prescribing ocrelizumab taking into 
consideration the pharmacodynamics of other disease modifying MS therapies.

Vaccinations 
The safety of immunisation with live or live-attenuated vaccines, following therapy has not been 
studied and vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and 
not until B-cell repletion. In clinical trials, the median time for B-cell repletion was 72 weeks (see 
section 5.1). 
In a randomised open-label study, RMS patients were able to mount humoral responses, although 
decreased, to tetanus toxoid, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide with or without a booster 
vaccine, keyhole limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza vaccines (see section 4.5 and 
5.1). 
It is recommended to vaccinate patients treated with ocrelizumab with seasonal influenza vaccines that 
are inactivated.   
Physicians should review the immunisation status of patients being considered for treatment with 
ocrelizumab. Patients who require vaccination should complete their immunisation at least 6 weeks 
prior to initiation of treatment.  
Exposure in utero to ocrelizumab and vaccination of neonates and infants with live or live attenuated 
vaccines 
Due to the potential depletion of B cells in infants of mothers who have been exposed to ocrelizumab 
during pregnancy, it is recommended that vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines should be 
delayed until B-cell levels have recovered; therefore, measuring CD19-positive B-cell levels in 
neonates and infants prior to vaccination is recommended. 
It is recommended that all vaccinations other than live or live-attenuated should follow the local 
immunisation schedule and measurement of vaccine-induced response titers should be considered to 
check whether individuals have mounted a protective immune response because the efficacy of the 
vaccination may be decreased. 
The safety and timing of vaccination should be discussed with the infant’s physician (see section 4.6). 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed, as no interactions are expected via cytochrome P450 
enzymes, other metabolising enzymes or transporters.   
Vaccinations 
The safety of immunisation with live or live-attenuated vaccines, following ocrelizumab therapy has 
not been studied. 
Data are available on the effects of tetanus toxoid, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza vaccines in patients receiving ocrelizumab (see 
section 4.4 and 5.1).  
After treatment over 2 years, the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers against S. 
pneumoniae, mumps, rubella and varicella were generally similar to the proportions at baseline.

Immunosuppressants  
It is not recommended to use other immunosuppressive therapies concomitantly with ocrelizumab 
except corticosteroids for symptomatic treatment of relapses (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential should use contraception while receiving ocrelizumab and for 
12 months after the last infusion of ocrelizumab. 
Pregnancy  
There is a limited amount of data from the use of ocrelizumab in pregnant women. Ocrelizumab is an 
immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG is known to cross the placental barrier. Postponing vaccination with 
live or live-attenuated vaccines should be considered for neonates and infants born to mothers who 
have been exposed to ocrelizumab in utero. No B cell count data have been collected in neonates and 
infants exposed to ocrelizumab and the potential duration of B-cell depletion in neonates and infants is 
unknown (see section 4.4).     
Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to 
mothers exposed to other anti-CD20 antibodies during pregnancy. 
Animal studies (embryo-foetal toxicity) do not indicate teratogenic effects. However, B-cell depletion 
in utero was detected. Reproductive toxicity was observed in pre- and post-natal development studies 
(see section 5.3).   
Ocrelizumab should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether ocrelizumab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ocrelizumab in milk (see 
section 5.3). A risk to neonates and infants cannot be excluded. Women should be advised to 
discontinue breast-feeding during therapy.  
Fertility 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on studies of male and female fertility in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ocrevus has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most important and frequently reported adverse reactions were IRRs (34.3%, 40.1% in RMS and 
PPMS, respectively) and infections (58.5%, 72.2% in RMS and PPMS, respectively) (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Infusion-related reactions 
Across the RMS and PPMS trials, symptoms associated with IRRs included, but are not limited to: 
pruritus, rash, urticaria, erythema, flushing, hypotension, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, throat 
irritation, oropharyngeal pain, dyspnoea, pharyngeal or laryngeal oedema, nausea, tachycardia. In 
controlled trials there were no fatal IRRs. In addition, symptoms of IRR in the post-marketing setting 
included anaphylaxis.  
In active-controlled (RMS) clinical trials, IRR was the most common adverse reaction in the 
ocrelizumab treatment group with an overall incidence of 34.3% compared with an incidence of 9.9% 
in the interferon beta-1a treatment group (placebo infusion). The incidence of IRRs was highest during 
the Dose 1, infusion 1 (27.5%) and decreased over time to <10% at Dose 4. The majority of IRRs in 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
both treatment groups were mild to moderate. 21.7% and 10.1% of ocrelizumab treated patients 
experienced mild and moderate IRRs respectively, 2.4% experienced severe IRRs and 0.1% 
experienced life-threatening IRRs.  
In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) clinical trial, IRR was the most common adverse reaction in the 
ocrelizumab treatment group with an overall incidence of 40.1% compared with an incidence of 25.5% 
in the placebo group. The incidence of IRRs was highest during Dose 1, infusion 1 (27.4%) and 
decreased with subsequent doses to <10% at Dose 4. A greater proportion of patients in each group 
experienced IRRs with the first infusion of each dose compared with the second infusion of that dose. 
The majority of IRRs were mild to moderate. 26.7% and 11.9% of ocrelizumab treated patients 
experienced mild and moderate IRRs respectively, 1.4% experienced severe IRRs. There were no life-
threatening IRRs. See section 4.4. 
Alternative shorter infusion of subsequent doses 
In a study (MA30143 Shorter Infusion Substudy) designed to characterise the safety profile of shorter 
(2-hour) ocrelizumab infusions in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, the incidence, 
intensity, and types of symptoms of IRRs were consistent with those of infusions administered over 
3.5 hours (see section 5.1). The overall number of interventions needed was low in both infusion 
groups, however, more interventions (slowing down or temporary interruptions) were needed to 
manage IRRs in the shorter (2-hour) infusion group compared to the 3.5-hour infusion group (8.7% vs. 
4.8%, respectively). 
Infection 
In the active-controlled studies in RMS, infections occurred in 58.5% of patients receiving 
ocrelizumab vs 52.5% of patients receiving interferon beta 1a. Serious infections occurred in 1.3% of 
patients receiving ocrelizumab vs 2.9% of patients receiving interferon beta 1a. In the placebo-
controlled study in PPMS, infections occurred in 72.2% of patients receiving ocrelizumab vs 69.9% of 
patients receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 6.2% of patients receiving ocrelizumab vs 
6.7% of patients receiving placebo. All patients switched to ocrelizumab during the open-label phase 
in both RMS and PPMS studies. An increase in the rate of serious infections was observed in RMS 
between Years 2 and 3, but not in subsequent years. No increase was observed in PPMS. 
Respiratory tract infections 
The proportion of respiratory tract infections was higher in ocrelizumab treated patients compared to 
interferon beta-1-a and placebo.    
In the RMS clinical trials, 39.9% of ocrelizumab treated patients and 33.2% interferon beta-1-a treated 
patients experienced an upper respiratory tract infection and 7.5% of ocrelizumab treated patients and 
5.2% of interferon beta-1-a treated patients experienced a lower respiratory tract infection.   
In the PPMS clinical trial, 48.8% of ocrelizumab treated patients and 42.7% of patients who received 
placebo experienced an upper respiratory tract infection, and 9.9% of ocrelizumab treated patients and 
9.2% of patients who received placebo experienced a lower respiratory tract infection.   
The respiratory tract infections reported in patients treated with ocrelizumab were predominately mild 
to moderate (80 – 90 %). 
Herpes 
In active-controlled (RMS) clinical trials, herpes infections were reported more frequently in  
ocrelizumab treated patients than in interferon-beta-1a treated patients including herpes zoster (2.1% 
vs 1.0%), herpes simplex (0.7 % vs 0.1 %), oral herpes (3.0% vs 2.2%), genital herpes (0.1% vs 0%) 
and herpes virus infection (0.1% vs 0%). All infections were mild to moderate in severity, except one 
Grade 3 event, and patients recovered with treatment by standard therapies.  
In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) clinical trial, a higher proportion of patients with oral herpes (2.7% 
vs 0.8%) were observed in the ocrelizumab treatment arm.

Ocrelizumab treatment resulted in a decrease in total immunoglobulins over the controlled period of 
the studies, mainly driven by reduction in IgM. Clinical trial data have shown an association between 
decreased levels of IgG (and less so for IgM or IgA) and serious infections.  
Lymphocytes 
In RMS, a decrease in lymphocyte < LLN was observed in 20.7% of patients treated with ocrelizumab 
compared with 32.6% of patients treated with interferon beta-1a.  In PPMS, a decrease in lymphocytes 
<LLN was observed in 26.3% of ocrelizumab treated patients vs 11.7% of placebo-treated patients. 
The majority of these decreases reported in ocrelizumab treated patients were Grade 1 (<LLN - 
800 cells/mm3) and 2 (between 500 and 800 cells/mm3) in severity. Approximately 1% of the patients 
in the ocrelizumab group had a Grade 3 lymphopenia (between 200 and 500 cells/mm3). None of the 
patients was reported with Grade 4 lymphopenia (< 200 cells/mm3). 
An increased rate of serious infections was observed during episodes of confirmed total lymphocytes 
counts decrease in ocrelizumab treated patients. The number of serious infections was too low to draw 
definitive conclusions. 
Neutrophils 
In the active-controlled (RMS) treatment period, a decrease in neutrophils < LNN was observed in 
14.7% of patients treated with ocrelizumab compared with 40.9% of patients treated with interferon 
beta-1a. In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) clinical trial, the proportion of ocrelizumab patients 
presenting decreased neutrophils was higher (12.9 %) than placebo patients (10.0 %); among these a 
higher percentage of patients (4.3%) in the ocrelizumabgroup had Grade 2 or above neutropenia vs 
1.3% in the placebo group; approximately 1% of the patients in the ocrelizumab group had Grade 4 
neutropenia vs 0% in the placebo group. 
The majority of the neutrophil decreases were transient (only observed once for a given patient treated 
with ocrelizumab) and were Grade 1 (between<LLN and 1500 cells/mm3) and 2 (between 1000 and 
1500 cells/mm3) in severity. Overall, approximately 1% of the patients in the ocrelizumab group had 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. One patient with grade 3 (between 500 and 1000 cells/mm3) and one patient 
with grade 4 (< 500 cells/mm3) neutropenia required specific treatment with granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor, and remained on ocrelizumab after the episode. Neutropenia can occur several 
months after the administration of ocrelizumab (see section 4.4).  
Other 
One patient, who received 2000 mg of ocrelizumab, died of systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS) of unknown aetiology, following a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination 
12 weeks after the last infusion; an anaphylactoid reaction to the MRI gadolinium-contrast agent could 
have contributed to the SIRS. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
There is limited clinical trial experience with doses higher than the approved intravenous dose of 
ocrelizumab. The highest dose tested to date in MS patients is 2000 mg, administered as two 1000 mg 
intravenous infusions separated by 2 weeks (Phase II dose finding study in RRMS). The adverse 
reactions were consistent with the safety profile in the pivotal clinical studies. 
There is no specific antidote in the event of an overdose; interrupt the infusion immediately and 
observe the patient for IRRs (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA36.  
Mechanism of action  
Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively targets CD20-
expressing B cells.   
CD20 is a cell surface antigen found on pre-B cells, mature and memory B cells but not expressed on 
lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells.    
The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in MS is not 
fully elucidated but is presumed to involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number 
and function of CD20-expressing B cells. Following cell surface binding, ocrelizumab selectively 
depletes CD20-expressing B cells through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and 
apoptosis. The capacity of B-cell reconstitution and pre-existing humoral immunity are preserved. In 
addition, innate immunity and total T-cell numbers are not affected. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Treatment with ocrelizumab leads to rapid depletion of CD19+ B cells in blood by 14 days post 
treatment (first time-point of assessment) as an expected pharmacologic effect. This was sustained 
throughout the treatment period. For the B-cell counts, CD19 is used, as the presence of ocrelizumab 
interferes with the recognition of CD20 by the assay.   
In the Phase III studies, between each dose of ocrelizumab, up to 5% of patients showed B-cell 
repletion (> lower limit of normal (LLN) or baseline) at least at one time point. The extent and 
duration of B-cell depletion was consistent in the PPMS and RMS trials.   
The longest follow up time after the last infusion (Phase II study WA21493, N=51) indicates that the 
median time to B-cell repletion (return to baseline/LLN whichever occurred first) was 72 weeks (range 
27 - 175 weeks). 90% of all patients had their B-cells repleted to LLN or baseline by approximately 
two and a half years after the last infusion.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) 
Efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active comparator-controlled clinical trials (WA21092 and WA21093), with identical design, in 
patients with relapsing forms of MS (in accordance with McDonald criteria 2010) and evidence of 
disease activity (as defined by clinical or imaging features) within the previous two years. Study 
design and baseline characteristics of the study population are summarised in Table 3.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the two treatment groups.  
Patients receiving ocrelizumab (Group A) were given 600 mg every 6 months (Dose 1 as 2 x 300 mg 
intravenous infusions, administered 2 weeks apart, and subsequent doses were administered as a single 
600 mg intravenous infusion). Patients in Group B were administered Interferon beta-1a 44 mcg via 
subcutaneous injection 3 times per week.

*Pre-specified pooled analysis of WA21092 and WA21093. 
Results of the pre-specified pooled analyses of time to CDP sustained for at least 12 weeks (40% risk 
reduction for ocrelizumab compared to interferon beta-1a (p=0.0006) were highly consistent with the 
results sustained for at least 24 weeks (40% risk reduction for ocrelizumab compared to interferon 
beta-1a, p=0.0025).    
The studies enrolled patients with active disease. These included both active treatment naive and 
previously treated inadequate responders, as defined by clinical or imaging features. Analysis of 
patient populations with differing baseline levels of disease activity, including active and highly active 
disease, showed that the efficacy of ocrelizumab on ARR and 12 week CDP was consistent with the 
overall population.   
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)  
Efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab were also evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial in patients with primary progressive MS (Study WA25046) who were early in 
their disease course according to the main inclusion criteria, i.e.: ages 18-55 years, inclusive; EDSS at 
screening from 3.0 to 6.5 points; disease duration from the onset of MS symptoms less than 10 years 
in patients with an EDSS at screening ≤5.0 or less than 15 years in patients with an EDSS at screening 
>5.0. With regard to disease activity, features characteristic of inflammatory activity, even in 
progressive MS, can be imaging-related, (i.e. T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and/or active [new or 
enlarging] T2 lesions). MRI evidence should be used to confirm inflammatory activity in all patients.  
Patients over 55 years of age were not studied. Study design and baseline characteristics of the study 
population are presented in Table 5. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the two treatment groups. Cranial 
MRI showed imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity either by T1 Gd enhancing 
lesions or T2 lesions.  
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the Phase 3 PPMS study, patients received 600 mg ocrelizumab every 6 months as two 300 mg 
infusions, given two weeks apart, throughout the treatment period. The 600 mg infusions in RMS and 
the 2 x 300 mg infusions in PPMS demonstrated consistent PK/PD profiles. IRR profiles per infusion 
were also similar, independent of whether the 600 mg dose was administered as a single 600 mg 
infusion or as two 300 mg infusions separated by two weeks (see sections 4.8 and 5.2), but due to 
overall more infusions with the 2 x 300 mg regimen, the total number of IRRs were higher. Therefore, 
after Dose 1 it is recommended to administer ocrelizumab in a 600 mg single infusion (see section 4.2) 
to reduce the total number of infusions (with concurrent exposure to prophylactic methylprednisolone 
and an antihistamine) and the related infusion reactions.

* All patients in this analysis had a minimum of 120 weeks of follow-up. The primary analysis is 
based on all events accrued.  
Pre-specified non-powered subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint suggests that patients who are 
younger or those with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline receive a greater treatment benefit than 
patients who are older or without T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (≤ 45 years: HR 0.64 [0.45, 0.92], 
>45 years: HR 0.88 [0.62, 1.26]; with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline: HR 0.65 [0.40-1.06], 
without T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline: HR 0.84 [0.62-1.13]).  
Moreover, post-hoc analyses suggested that younger patients with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline 
have the better treatment effect (≤ 45 years: HR 0.52 [0.27-1.00]; ≤ 46 years [median age of the 
WA25046 study]; HR 0.48 [0.25-0.92]; <51 years: HR 0.53 [0.31-0.89]).   
Post-hoc analyses were performed in the Extended Controlled Period (ECP), which includes double-
blinded treatment and approximately 9 additional months of controlled follow-up before continuing 
into the Open-Label Extension (OLE) or until withdrawal from study treatment. The proportion of 
patients with 24 week Confirmed Disability Progression of EDSS≥7.0 (24W-CDP of EDSS≥7.0, time 
to wheelchair) was 9.1% in the placebo group compared to 4.8% in the ocrelizumab group at Week 
144, resulting in a 47% risk reduction of the time to wheelchair (HR 0.53, [0.31, 0.92]) during the 
ECP. As these results were exploratory in nature and included data after unblinding, the results should 
be interpreted with caution. 
Shorter infusion substudy 
The safety of the shorter (2-hour) ocrelizumab infusion was evaluated in a prospective, multicenter, 
randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel arm substudy to Study MA30143 (Ensemble) in patients 
with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis that were naïve to other disease modifying treatments. 
The first dose was administered as two 300 mg infusions (600 mg total) separated by 14 days. Patients 
were randomised from their second dose onwards (Dose 2 to 6) in a 1:1 ratio to either the conventional 
infusion group with ocrelizumab infused over approximately 3.5 hours every 24 weeks, or the shorter 
20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
infusion group with ocrelizumab infused over approximately 2 hours every 24 weeks. The 
randomisation was stratified by region and the dose at which patients were first randomised. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IRRs occurring during or within 24 hours 
following the first randomised infusion. The primary analysis was performed when 580 patients were 
randomised. The proportion of patients with IRRs occurring during or within 24 hours following the 
first randomised infusion was 24.6% in the shorter infusion compared to 23.1% in the conventional 
infusion group. The stratified group difference was similar. Overall, in all randomised doses, the 
majority of the IRRs were mild or moderate and only two IRRs were severe in intensity, with one 
severe IRR in each group. There were no life-threatening, fatal, or serious IRRs. 
Immunogenicity  
Patients in MS trials (WA21092, WA21093 and WA25046) were tested at multiple time points 
(baseline and every 6 months post treatment for the duration of the trial) for anti-drug antibodies 
(ADAs). Out of 1311 patients treated with ocrelizumab, 12 (~1%) tested positive for treatment-
emergent ADAs, of which 2 patients tested positive for neutralising antibodies. The impact of 
treatment-emergent ADAs on safety and efficacy cannot be assessed given the low incidence of ADA 
associated with ocrelizumab. 
Immunisations 
In a randomised open-label study in RMS patients (N=102), the percentage of patients with a positive 
response to tetanus vaccine at 8 weeks after vaccination was 23.9% in the ocrelizumab group 
compared to 54.5% in the control group (no disease-modifying therapy except interferon-beta).  
Geometric mean anti-tetanus toxoid specific antibody titers at 8 weeks were 3.74 and 9.81 IU/ml, 
respectively. Positive response to ≥5 serotypes in 23-PPV at 4 weeks after vaccination was 71.6% in 
the ocrelizumab group and 100% in the control group. In patients treated with ocrelizumab a booster 
vaccine (13-PCV) given 4 weeks after 23-PPV did not markedly enhance the response to 12 serotypes 
in common with 23-PPV. The percentage of patients with seroprotective titers against five influenza 
strains ranged from 20.0−60.0% and 16.7−43.8% pre-vaccination and at 4 weeks post vaccination 
from 55.6−80.0% in patients treated with ocrelizumab and 75.0−97.0% in the control group, 
respectively. See sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ocrevus in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. See 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ocrelizumab in the MS studies were described by a two compartment model 
with time-dependent clearance, and with PK parameters typical for an IgG1 monoclonal antibody.  
The overall exposure (AUC over the 24 weeks dosing interval) was identical in the 2 x 300 mg in 
PPMS and 1 x 600 mg in RMS studies, as expected given an identical dose was administered. Area 
under the curve (AUCτ) after the 4th dose of 600 mg ocrelizumab was 3510 µg/mL•day, and mean 
maximum concentration (Cmax) was 212 µg/mL in RMS (600 mg infusion) and 141 µg/mL in PPMS 
(300 mg infusions).  
Absorption  
Ocrelizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with 
other routes of administration.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
The population pharmacokinetics estimate of the central volume of distribution was 2.78 L. Peripheral 
volume and inter-compartment clearance were estimated at 2.68 L and 0.294 L/day.   
Biotransformation  
The metabolism of ocrelizumab has not been directly studied, as antibodies are cleared principally by 
catabolism (i.e. breakdown into peptides and amino acids). 
Elimination  
Constant clearance was estimated at 0.17 L/day, and initial time-dependent clearance at  
0.0489 L/day which declined with a half-life of 33 weeks. The terminal elimination half-life of 
ocrelizumab was 26 days.  
Special populations  
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ocrelizumab in children and 
adolescents less than 18 years of age. 
Elderly 
There are no dedicated PK studies of ocrelizumab in patients ≥55 years due to limited clinical 
experience (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
No formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted. Patients with mild renal impairment were 
included in clinical trials and no change in the pharmacokinetics of ocrelizumab was observed in those 
patients. There is no PK information available in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted. Patients with mild hepatic impairment were 
included in clinical trials, and no change in the pharmacokinetics was observed in those patients. 
There is no PK information available in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and embryo-foetal development. Neither carcinogenicity nor 
mutagenicity studies have been conducted with ocrelizumab.   
In two pre- and post-natal development studies in cynomolgus monkeys, administration 
of ocrelizumab from gestation day 20 to at least parturition was associated with glomerulopathy, 
lymphoid follicle formation in bone marrow, lymphoplasmacytic renal inflammation, and decreased 
testicular weight in offspring. The maternal doses administered in these studies resulted in maximum 
mean serum concentrations (Cmax) that were 4.5- to 21-fold above those anticipated in the clinical 
setting. 
There were five cases of neonatal moribundities, one attributed to weakness due to premature birth 
accompanied by opportunistic bacterial infection, one due to an infective meningoencephalitis 
involving the cerebellum of the neonate from a maternal dam with an active bacterial infection 
(mastitis) and three with evidence of jaundice and hepatic damage, with a viral aetiology suspected, 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possibly a polyomavirus. The course of these five confirmed or suspected infections could have 
potentially been impacted by B-cell depletion. Newborn offspring of maternal animals exposed to 
ocrelizumab were noted to have depleted B cell populations during the post-natal phase.  Measurable 
levels of ocrelizumab were detected in milk (approximated 0.2% of steady state trough serum levels) 
during the lactation period.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ocrevus is and what it is used for 
What Ocrevus is 
Ocrevus contains the active substance ‘ocrelizumab’. It is a type of protein called a ‘monoclonal 
antibody’. Antibodies work by attaching to specific targets in your body. 
What Ocrevus is used for 
Ocrevus is used to treat adults with: 
• 
• 
Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS)  
Early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) 
What is Multiple Sclerosis 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects the central nervous system, especially the nerves in the brain and 
spinal cord. In MS, the immune system (the body’s defence system) works incorrectly and attacks a 
protective layer (called myelin sheath) around nerve cells and causes inflammation. Breakdown of the 
myelin sheath stops the nerves working properly. 
Symptoms of MS depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected and can include  
problems with walking and balance, weakness, numbness, double vision and blurring, poor 
coordination and bladder problems.  
• 
• 
In relapsing forms of MS, the patient has repeated attacks of symptoms (relapses). The 
symptoms can appear suddenly within a few hours, or slowly over several days. The symptoms 
disappear or improve between relapses but damage may build up and lead to permanent 
disability.  
In primary progressive MS, the symptoms generally continue to worsen from the start of the 
disease.  
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How does Ocrevus work? 
Ocrevus attaches to specific B cells, which are a type of white blood cells that are part of the immune 
system and play a role in MS. Ocrevus targets and removes those specific B cells. This reduces 
inflammation and attacks on the myelin sheath, reduces the chance of having a relapse and slows the 
progression of your disease. 
• 
• 
In Relapsing forms of MS (RMS), Ocrevus helps to significantly reduce the number of attacks 
(relapses) and significantly slow down the progression of the disease. Ocrevus also significantly 
increases the chance of a patient having no evidence of disease activity (brain lesions, relapses 
and worsening of disability). 
In Primary Progressive MS (PPMS), Ocrevus helps to slow down the progression of the 
disease and reduce deterioration in walking speed.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Ocrevus 
You must not be given Ocrevus: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to ocrelizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you currently have an infection.  
if you have been told that you have severe problems with your immune system. 
if you have cancer. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given Ocrevus. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before you are given Ocrevus if any of the following apply to you. Your doctor 
may decide to delay your treatment with Ocrevus, or may decide you cannot receive Ocrevus if: 
• 
you have an infection. Your doctor will wait until the infection is resolved before giving you 
Ocrevus. 
you have ever had hepatitis B or are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus. This is because medicines 
like Ocrevus can cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again. Before your Ocrevus 
treatment, your doctor will check if you are at risk of hepatitis B infection. Patients who have 
had hepatitis B or are carriers of the hepatitis B virus will have a blood test and will be 
monitored by a doctor for signs of hepatitis B infection.  
you have cancer or if you have had cancer in the past. Your doctor may decide to delay your 
treatment with Ocrevus. 
• 
• 
Effect on the immune system: 
• 
Diseases that affect your immune system: if you have another disease which affects the 
immune system. You may not be able to receive Ocrevus. 
•  Medicines that affect your immune system: if you have ever taken, are taking or are planning 
to take medicines that affect the immune system – such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants 
or other medicines used to treat MS. Your doctor may decide to delay your treatment with 
Ocrevus or may ask you to stop such medicines before starting treatment with Ocrevus. See 
under ‘Other medicines and Ocrevus’, below for more information. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infusion-related reactions   
• 
• 
• 
Infusion-related reactions are the most common side effect of Ocrevus treatment. 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any infusion-related reaction (see 
section 4 for a list of infusion-related reactions). Infusion-related reactions can happen during 
the infusion or up to 24 hours after the infusion.  
To reduce the risk of infusion-related reaction, your doctor will give you other medicines before 
each infusion of Ocrevus (see section 3) and you will be closely monitored during the infusion 
and for at least one hour after the infusion has been given. 
Infections 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Ocrevus if you think you have an infection. Your 
doctor will wait until the infection is resolved before giving you Ocrevus. 
You might get infections more easily with Ocrevus. This is because the immune cells that 
Ocrevus targets also help to fight infection.  
Before you start treatment with Ocrevus and before subsequent infusions, your doctor may ask 
you to have a blood test to verify your immune system because infections may occur more 
frequently in case of severe problems with your immune system. 
If you are treated with Ocrevus for primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and you have 
swallowing difficulties, Ocrevus may increase the risk of severe pneumonia. 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of these signs of infection during 
or after Ocrevus treatment:  
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you think your MS is getting worse or if you 
notice any new symptoms. This is because of a very rare and life-threatening brain infection, 
called ‘progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy’ (PML), which can cause symptoms similar 
to those of MS. PML can occur in patients taking Ocrevus. 
Tell your partner or carer about your Ocrevus treatment. They might notice symptoms of 
PML that you do not, such as memory lapses, trouble thinking, difficulty walking, sight loss, 
changes in the way you talk, which your doctor may need to investigate. 
fever or chills 
cough that does not go away 
herpes (such as cold sore, shingles or genital sores).  
Vaccinations 
• 
Tell your doctor if you have recently been given any vaccine or might be given a vaccine in the 
near future.  
•  While you are being treated with Ocrevus, you should not be given live or live attenuated 
• 
• 
vaccines (for example BCG for tuberculosis or vaccines against yellow fever).  
Your doctor may recommend that you are given a seasonal influenza vaccine. 
Your doctor will check if you need any vaccinations before you start treatment with Ocrevus. 
Any vaccinations should be given at least 6 weeks before you start treatment with Ocrevus. 
Children and adolescents 
Ocrevus is not intended to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old. This is because it 
has not yet been studied in this age group. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Ocrevus 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
In particular tell your doctor if: 
• 
you have ever taken, are taking or are planning to take medicines that affect the immune 
system – such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or other medicines used to treat MS. The 
effect on the immune system of these medicines with Ocrevus could be too strong. Your doctor 
may decide to delay your treatment with Ocrevus or may ask you to stop such medicines before 
starting treatment with Ocrevus. 
you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. This is because Ocrevus may lower blood 
pressure. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking your blood pressure medicines for 12 hours 
before each Ocrevus infusion.  
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before you are given 
Ocrevus. 
Pregnancy 
• 
• 
• 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. This is because Ocrevus may cross the 
placenta and affect your baby. 
Do not use Ocrevus if you are pregnant unless you have discussed this with your doctor. Your 
doctor will consider the benefit of you taking Ocrevus against the risk to your baby.  
Talk to your doctor before vaccinating your baby.   
Contraception for women 
Women who could become pregnant must use contraception: 
• 
• 
during treatment with Ocrevus and 
for 12 months after your last infusion of Ocrevus. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with Ocrevus. This is because Ocrevus may pass into 
breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not known whether Ocrevus can affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines.  
Your doctor will tell you whether your MS may affect your ability to drive or use tools and machines 
safely.  
Ocrevus contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How Ocrevus is given  
Ocrevus will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. 
They will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side 
effects. You will always be given Ocrevus as a drip (intravenous infusion). 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicines you will have before you are given Ocrevus 
Before you are given Ocrevus, you will receive other medicines to prevent or reduce possible side 
effects such as infusion-related reactions (see sections 2 and 4 for information about infusion-related 
reactions). 
You will receive a corticosteroid and an anti-histamine before each infusion and you may also receive 
medicines to reduce fever. 
How much and how often you will be given Ocrevus 
You will be given a total dose of 600 mg of Ocrevus every 6 months. 
• 
The first 600 mg dose of Ocrevus will be given as 2 separate infusions (300 mg each), given 
2 weeks apart. Each infusion will last about 2 hours 30 minutes. 
The next 600 mg doses of Ocrevus will be given as a single infusion. Depending on the rate of 
the subsequent infusion, each infusion will either last about 3 hours 30 minutes or 2 hours. 
• 
How Ocrevus is given  
• 
• 
Ocrevus will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse. It will be given as an infusion into a vein 
(intravenous infusion or IV infusion). 
You will be closely monitored while you are being given Ocrevus and for at least 1 hour after 
the infusion has been given. This is in case you have any side effects such as infusion-related 
reactions. The infusion may be slowed, temporarily stopped or permanently stopped if you have 
an infusion-related reaction, depending on how serious it is (see sections 2 and 4 for information 
about infusion-related reactions). 
If you miss an infusion of Ocrevus 
• 
• 
If you miss an infusion of Ocrevus, talk to your doctor to arrange to have it as soon as possible. 
Do not wait until your next planned infusion. 
To get the full benefit of Ocrevus, it is important that you receive each infusion when it is due. 
If you stop Ocrevus treatment 
• 
• 
• 
It is important to continue your treatment for as long as you and your doctor decide that it is 
helping you.  
Some side effects can be related to having low B cells. After you stop Ocrevus treatment, you 
may still experience side effects until your B-cells return to normal. Your blood B-cells will 
gradually increase to normal levels. This can take from six months to two and a half years, or up 
to several years in rare cases.  
Before you start any other medicines, tell your doctor when you had your last Ocrevus infusion.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Read the SmPC for additional information.  
 In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Posology  
• 
Initial dose 
The initial 600 mg dose is administered as two separate intravenous infusions; first as a 300 mg 
infusion, followed 2 weeks later by a second 300 mg infusion. 
• 
Subsequent doses 
Subsequent doses of ocrelizumab thereafter are administered as a single 600 mg intravenous infusion 
every 6 months (see Table 1). The first subsequent dose of 600 mg should be administered six months 
after the first infusion of the initial dose. A minimum interval of 5 months should be maintained 
between each dose of ocrelizumab.   
Figure 1: Dose and Schedule of Ocrevus 
Management of IRRs before the infusion 
• 
• 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by an experienced healthcare professional with 
access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as serious infusion-
related reactions (IRRs), hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylactic reactions.  
Premedication for IRRs 
The two following premedications must be administered prior to each ocrelizumab infusion to 
reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs: 
- 
100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) approximately 30 minutes 
prior to each infusion; 
antihistamine approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion; 
- 
In addition, premedication with an antipyretic (e.g., paracetamol) may also be considered 
approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may occur during infusions. Therefore, withholding of 
antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each 
Ocrevus infusion. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart 
Association III & IV) were not studied.   
Instructions for dilution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The product should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Do not 
shake the vial. A sterile needle and syringe should be used to prepare the diluted infusion 
solution. 
The product is intended for single use only. 
Concentrate may contain fine translucent and/or reflective particles associated with enhanced 
opalescence. Do not use the concentrate if discoloured or if the concentrate contains foreign 
particulate matter. 
Medicinal product must be diluted before administration. Solutions for intravenous 
administration are prepared by dilution of the concentrate into an infusion bag containing 
isotonic sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (300mg/250mL or 
600mg/500mL), to a final ocrelizumab concentration of approximately 1.2 mg/mL.  
The diluted infusion solution must be administered using an infusion set with a 0.2 or 
0.22 micron in-line filter.  
Prior to the start of the intravenous infusion, the content of the infusion bag should be at room 
temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low 
temperatures. 
Method of administration 
• 
• 
After dilution, treatment is administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line. 
Infusions should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

Infusion adjustments in case of IRRs  
In case of IRRs during any infusion, see the following adjustments.   
Life-threatening IRRs   
If there are signs of a life threatening or disabling IRR during an infusion, such as acute 
hypersensitivity or acute respiratory distress syndrome the infusion must be stopped immediately and 
the patient should receive appropriate treatment. The infusion must be permanently discontinued in 
these patients (see section 4.3). 
Severe IRRs 
If a patient experiences a severe IRR (such as dyspnea) or a complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain 
symptoms, the infusion should be interrupted immediately and the patient should receive symptomatic 
treatment. The infusion should be restarted only after all symptoms have resolved. The initial infusion 
rate at restart should be half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the reaction. No infusion 
adjustment is necessary for subsequent new infusions, unless the patient experiences an IRR. 
Mild to moderate IRRs 
If a patient experiences a mild to moderate IRR (e.g., headache), the infusion rate should be reduced to 
half the rate at the onset of the event. This reduced rate should be maintained for at least 30 minutes. If 
tolerated, the infusion rate may then be increased according to the patient’s initial infusion rate. No 
infusion adjustment is necessary for subsequent new infusions, unless the patient experiences an IRR. 
• 
• 
Patients who experience severe pulmonary symptoms, such as bronchospasm or asthma 
exacerbation, must have their infusion interrupted immediately and permanently. After 
administering symptomatic treatment, monitor the patient until the pulmonary symptoms have 
resolved because initial improvement of clinical symptoms could be followed by deterioration. 
Hypersensitivity may be difficult to distinguish from an IRR in terms of symptoms. If a 
hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion, the infusion must be stopped immediately 
and permanently.    
After the infusion 
• 
• 
Patients should be observed for at least one hour after the completion of the infusion for any 
symptom of an IRR. 
Physicians should alert patients that an IRR can occur within 24 hours of infusion. 
Shelf life  
Unopened vial 
2 years 
Diluted solution for intravenous infusion 
• 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2-8°C and 
subsequently 8 hours at room temperature. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2-8°C and subsequently 8 hours at room 
temperature, unless dilution undertaken in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
In the event an intravenous infusion cannot be completed the same day, the remaining solution 
should be discarded.

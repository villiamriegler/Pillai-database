INTRODUCTION 
The MAH submitted 1 completed paediatric study W97-225 for Norvir, in accordance with Article 
45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.  
One other study, R&D/04/110. (a retrospective patient registry/observational Cohort study in 
Switzerland comparing lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) is also mentioned. This has 
not been accessed, but will be discussed in relation to the submission for Kaletra in view of the 
type of comparisons in this study. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. In this document the two pediatric 
studies mentioned above were identified and reviewed in which ritonavir was administered as an 
antiretroviral agent. The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy demonstrated by these two 
studies are consistent with the ritonavir product label. 
Ritonavir is already approved by the CHMP for the indication of treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adults and children.  
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Norvir 
and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
In addition, the following documentation has been included as per the procedural guidance:

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

•  Objective(s) 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 2 
doses of ritonavir in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) 
lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) and stavudine (d4T, Zerit) in HIV-1 infected children of 6 months to 12 
years of age. 
•  Study design 
This  was  a  Phase  I/II  open-label,  randomized  study  that  evaluated  two  dose  levels  of  ritonavir 
namely 350 or 400 mg/m2 in combination with lamivudine and stavudine. Patients were naïve to 
protease inhibitors and to at least 1 of the 2 nucleoside agents used in the study. Patients were 
to  remain  on  their  assigned  treatment  regimen  for  24  weeks.  After  completion  of  the  24-week 
treatment  period,  patients  were  eligible  to  continue  therapy  during  a  24-week  extension 
treatment period. 
The revised1 randomization method used a block size of 2 and provided for a stratified 
randomization procedure (by the 2 age groups, children between 6 and 24 months and children 
2 to 12 years of age). In both cases, the block size was fixed. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Main inclusion criteria: Participating patients were to be between the ages of 6 months and 12 
years with a HIV- 1 infection diagnosis based on a positive ELISA test and with viral loads above 
5000 copies/mL. They were protease inhibitor naive, naive to at least 1 of the 2 nucleosides, and 
showed absence of acute infections requiring treatment. 
In total 76 patients from Brazil (out of the 106 screened) were enrolled and randomised; 42 
patients were assigned to receive the 350 mg/ m2 dose , and 34 were assigned to receive the 
400 mg/m2 dose. 
Only a subgroup participated in the pharmacokinetic sub-study.  
•  Treatments 
Ritonavir (Norvir, RTV, ABT-538) was supplied by Abbott in oral suspension (80 mg/mL) or in 
100 mg capsules. Doses of ritonavir were administered twice each day (approximately 12 hours 
apart), preferably with food, and could have been given together with stavudine and lamivudine. 
During the first 7 days of dosing, patients received the standard dose of lamivudine and 
stavudine along with escalating doses of ritonavir. 
Stavudine was supplied in capsules containing 15 or 20 mg of stavudine, and also as a 
paediatric powder blend yielding a 1 mg/mL concentration following reconstitution. Doses of 
stavudine did not exceed 40 mg BID and were dependent upon body weight, as follows: 
Table 2. Stavudine dosing 
Lamivudine was supplied in a syrup formulation with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Doses of 
lamivudine were always 4 mg/kg BID. 
Both lamivudine and stavudine were administered beginning on Day 1. 
Dosage of all study medications was recalculated at each visit. When a patient's weight or body 
surface area (BSA) changed the new dose was adjusted. 
1 Revised after dropping the originally planned 300 mg/m2 dose group.

The patients for PK evaluations were identified at enrolment and underwent additional 
procedures at the Week 4 visit if they had been receiving the study drugs at the assigned doses 
for at least 1 week preceding the visit. Patients were required to report to the study site without 
taking any of the morning's study medication. If patients had taken the medication, they were 
permitted to return within 3 days for the pharmacokinetic study procedures. Blood sampling was 
initiated with a pre-dosing sample within 10 minutes of 0800 hours. The 3 drugs were 
administered simultaneously (with or without food) under the observation of study personnel. 
Subsequently 1 to 2 ml, blood samples were taken at 09:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 
20:00 hours. 
Compliance was assessed based on all medication bottles which were returned to the study site 
at each visit for assessment of the number of solid formulation doses remaining or the amount of 
liquid formulation remaining, as appropriate. The assessments were recorded in the case report 
form. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the time-normalized area under the curve (AUC) through 
Week 24 for the change from baseline in log10 viral load. Secondary variables included: the 
number of patients with viral loads below the limit of quantification (LOQ: <400 copies/mL); the 
time-normalized AUC for the change from baseline in log10 viral load during the extension 
treatment period from the end of Week 24 to Week 48; the log10 viral loads at each visit and at 
endpoint; the time-normalized AUCs through Week 24 and through Week 48 for the change from 
baseline in log CD4 cell count; loge CD4 cell count at each visit and at endpoint; and progression 
of CDC disease stage. 
PK parameters included Cmax, Cmin, predose concentration (C0 or Ctrough), Tmin, the area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from hour 0 to hour 12 (AUC12), and the apparent clearance 
(CL/F). 
Safety evaluations included analysis of AEs and HIV-related events using COSTART III 
summarization, and changes from baseline vital signs and laboratory determinations 
•  Statistical Methods 
The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the comparison of the primary variable for 
observed cases without retrieved dropouts in the ITT population. Secondary analyses included 
analyses of completers population with retrieved dropouts, for completers with and without 
retrieved dropouts, for the PP cohort without retrieved dropouts, and for PP completers without 
retrieved dropouts. These comparisons were performed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) using 
randomization group, study center, and group/center interaction as factors. The same cohorts 
were analyzed for all secondary variables. 
[For the handling of dropouts or missing data, the LOCF method was used for assessment of 
efficacy parameters at endpoint]. 
In addition, the absolute changes from baseline in viral load and CD4 Cell count at each weekly 
visit and at endpoint were evaluated with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA 
model included Randomization Group and Study Center as factors tested for main effects and 
for interaction. 
The number of patients with viral loads below the limit of quantification at each study visit was 
tested with Fisher's exact test to examine possible differences between randomization groups. In 
addition, a post-hoc analysis was performed on subsets of patients based on the patients' 
previous treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Patients were 
classified as naïve to all 3 of the drugs used in the study or naïve to 2 of the 3 drugs used in the 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 45 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

study. This subset analysis was performed to determine if a greater proportion of patients who 
were naïve to all 3 of the drugs used in the study would achieve viral loads below the LOQ.  
For the purpose of the pharmacokinetic analysis, dose group (two levels) and gender were used 
as classification factors, while age, body surface area (BSA) and one of two disease factors 
(baseline CD, cell count or baseline viral load) were used as covariates in the two-way ANCOVA 
models. In particular, one ANCOVA model included effects for dose group, gender, age, age-by-
gender interaction (i.e., males and females had separate slopes for age), BSA, and baseline 
CD4 cell count. The other ANCOVA model included effects for dose group, gender, age, age-by-
gender interaction, BSA, and baseline viral load (HIV RNA). Additionally, the partial Pearson 
correlation with classification by dose group was calculated to assess the association between 
each pharmacokinetic variable and age or BSA. The statistical test of the association was 
performed under the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the pharmacokinetic variable 
and either age or BSA. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The numbers of patients analysed are presented in the following Table.   
Of  106  patients  screened,  76  were  eligible  to  participate  and  were  assigned  to  treatment 
according to the randomization list. The first 24-week course of dosing was completed by 35 of 
42 patients (83.3%) receiving 350 mg/m2 and all 34 patients (100%) receiving 400 mg/m2.  
A total of 10 patients (all from the 350 mg/m2 group) discontinued the study, 7 during the initial 
24-week phase and 3 during the 48-week extension. The most common reason for 
discontinuation was adverse event (AE) (5/10 patients, all from the 350 mg/m2 dose group).

The 2 dose groups were clinically similar in main demographic and disease characteristics. 
Approximately half of the patients (40/76 patients, 52.6%) was under the age of 6 years (i.e., <72 
months). The majority of patients in both groups became HIV-infected through maternal 
transmission (73/76, 96. 1 %). Median age at time of diagnosis was 18 months for the 350 
mg/m2 group and 21 months for the 400 mg/m2 group. Median duration of disease was 33.5 and 
39.5 months for the 2 dose groups, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
A total of 33 patients from the 350 and 400 mg/m2 dosing groups were enrolled in the PK sub-
study. All patients participating in the pharmacokinetic evaluation were between the age of 2 and 
12 years (range, 2 years, 6 months to 12 years, 9 months). There were 19 patients from the 350 
mg/m2 dose group (Group I) and 14 patients from the 400 mg/m2 dose group (Group II). 
•  Efficacy results 
Virological response 
 Results from each analysis cohort for the time-normalized AUC for change from baseline in 
log10 viral load for the 24-week course of treatment and the extension to 48 weeks are shown in 
the following table. 
Table 5. Summary of Time-Normalized Area Under the Curve for Change from Baseline in 
Log-Transformed Viral Load 
The results for the lower dose level were better than for the higher dose level, although none of 
these differences achieved statistical significance in the ANCOVA comparison of randomization 
group. There were some statistically significant site interactions and randomization group-by-site 
interactions, but due to the limited number of subjects, no further investigation was performed. 
Results for mean change in viral load (log10 copies/mL) from baseline at each study visit for the 
ITT and PP analysis cohorts were similar for both dose levels.  See the following table.

Table  6.  Summary  of  mean  change  in  viral  load  (log10  copies/mL)  from  baseline  at  each 
study visit for the ITT analysis cohort 
Similar results were obtained for the number of patients achieving a plasma viral load below the 
LOQ in the 2 dose groups at each visit. Similar observations were seen for patients when results 
were analyzed by prior treatment with NRTIs. A greater proportion of patients who were naïve to 
all 3 of the drugs used in this study achieved viral loads below the LOQ at Week 24 compared to 
those patients who were naïve to only 2 of the 3 study drugs (total of 57.6% versus 27.0%, 
respectively). See the following table. 
Table 7. Number of Patients with Plasma Viral Load Below Quantifiable Levels for the ITT 
Analysis Cohort by Prior NRTI Therapy 
The difference between randomization groups was not statistically significant at any of the 
timepoints when analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (p-values ranged from 
0.3613 to 0.763).

Immunological response  
In all analyses, mean time-normalized AUC for change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 
higher in the 400 mg/m2 dose group as compared to the 350 mg/m2 group. These differences 
achieved statistical significance for the comparison in the primary analysis cohort (ITT) at Week 
48, (p=0.0240) in the ANCOVA comparison of randomized group. 
In the secondary analysis cohorts, there were several statistically significant effects in the 
ANCOVA comparison for randomized group. See the table below. 
Table 8. Summary of mean time-normalized AUC for changes from baseline in log 
transformed CD4 cell count 
Similar trends were observed at the individual evaluation timepoints, the mean change in 
CD4cell count was numerically higher in the 400 mg/m2 dose group as compared to the 350 
mg/m2 dose group.

Efficacy results of this study in relation to other studies. The antiviral and immunologic findings 
from this study are consistent with those reported for other studies in similarly aged HIV-infected 
paediatric patients. As summarized in the table below.

The reductions in viral load observed in this study are comparable to the 1.5 log10 decrease 
reported by Thuret et al.9 The percentage of patients with HIV RNA levels below the LOQ in this 
study are also comparable to those reported by Thuret et al9 and Nachman et al10. However, 
these rates are all lower than those reported in studies in HIV-infected adults 7,11 despite the use 
of more sensitive viral load assays with lower LOQ in the adult studies. As mentioned previously, 
these lower rates are partly a function of the patients' prior NRTI therapy and vertical 
transmission of HIV at a time when the immune system is incompetent. This leads to a poor 
humoral and cellular primary response to HIV, associated higher viral loads in children 
compared to adults and a more rapid progression to AIDS in children (4.8 years) compared to 
adults (10.0 years). Like in adults, careful consideration must be given to a patient's previous 
antiretroviral treatment experience before NRTI therapy is prescribed. 
PK results 
The data show, relative ritonavir plasma exposures from the 2 dosing regimens appeared to be 
similar, probably as a result of relatively high intersubject variability and only a 14% increase in 
dose from 350 to 400 mg/m2. See the following table.

The mean (SD) plasma concentration-time profiles from Week 4, plotted on a linear scale, are 
presented in the following figure.

Age and BSA appear to be significant predictors of ritonavir pharmacokinetics when both are 
included as covariates; however, these factors are highly positively correlated, and results 
should be interpreted with caution. Gender has no significant effect on steady-state ritonavir 
pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients. Ritonavir concentrations do not appear to be dependent 
on disease factors, such as baseline CD4 cell count or baseline HIV RNA. In children older than 
2 years of age receiving a dosing regimen of 350 mg/m2 or 400 mg/m2 BID, steady-state 
ritonavir concentrations appear to be similar to those reported in adults at 600 mg BID. Mean 
Cmin in paediatric patients appeared to be somewhat lower than that noted in adult patients, see 
the following table.

frequent in the 400 mg/m2 group. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
3. 
Ritonavir is generally used at lower doses as PK enhancing PI in the EU and most countries in 
the  world.  The  provided  study  in  HIV-infected  children  from  6  months  to  12  years  of  age,  the 
tested  ritonavir  therapeutic  dosing  regimens  of  350  mg/m2  or  400  mg/m2  in  combination  with 
lamivudine and stavudine demonstrated similar antiviral and immunological results at Week 24 
and Week  48. The  results  are  consistent  with  data from  a  couple  limited published  data  in the 
literature and do not raise new safety concerns. Of note, the number of patients younger than 2 
years of age remains limited to 9 patients (approx. 12% of the tested population).  
Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The new data with therapeutic doses of ritonavir in combination with two NRTIs (lamivudine and 
stavudine) from this study in paediatric patients from Brazil add further support to the approved 
posology for paediatric patients (2 years of age and above) in the EU as mentioned in the Norvir 
SmPC; the recommended dosage of Norvir solution in children is 350 mg/m² orally twice daily 
and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased 
at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily. In this regard there is no need to amend section 
4.2 in the SmPC.  
Issues which need Type II variation: 
Section 5.1 can be expanded with a brief summary of few lines mentioning the present results at 
the end of subsection Clinical pharmacodynamic data in a similar fashion as the other brief 
results in paediatric patients using the therapeutic ritonavir doses.

I. 
Introduction 
On August 8, 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
II.  Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study Malaria-063 is a stand-alone study. The main objective of the study was to 
compare  immune  responses  to  the  hepatitis  B  component  of  an  experimental  hepatitis  B+  malaria 
(RTS,S/AS01E) vaccine, and compare the antibody levels to that of Engerix-B.  
It  should  be  noted  that  Engerix-B,  Rotarix,  Infanrix/Hib  and  Polio  Sabin  are  also  administered  in  the 
study.  Article  46  applications  for  these  concerned  vaccines  have  been  sent  in  parallel  to  relevant 
authorities.  
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The commercially available formulation of Synflorix was used in the study.  
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
MALARIA-063, Phase III randomized, open, controlled study to evaluate the immune response 
to  the  hepatitis  B  antigen  of  the  RTS,S/AS01E  candidate  vaccine,  when  administered  as  primary 
vaccination integrated into an EPI regimen to infants living in sub-Saharan Africa 
Clinical study 
MALARIA-063,  Phase  III  randomized,  open,  controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  immune 
response  to  the  hepatitis  B  antigen  of  the  RTS,S/AS01E  candidate  vaccine,  when 
administered as primary vaccination integrated into an EPI regimen to infants living in sub-
Saharan Africa 
Description 
This was a phase III, multi-center, open, randomized, controlled trial with 11 study groups. Synflorix 
was one of the vaccines that were co-administered with the experimental vaccine  RTS,S/AS01E.

Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: 
Immunogenicity 
To  demonstrate  in  terms  of  antibody  response  to  the  HBs  antigen  (HBsAg),  the  non-inferiority  of 
RTS,S/AS01E to a primary vaccination regimen of a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) integrated 
into an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) regimen. 
Criteria  for  non-inferiority:  one  month  post  Dose  3,  upper  limit  (UL)  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence 
interval  (CI)  on  the  difference  in  percent  seroprotection  below  5%  between  recipients  of  licensed 
hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) and recipients of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine. 
Secondary: 
Immunogenicity 
• 
To  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  antibody  responses  to  the  pneumococcal  conjugate 
vaccine when co-administered with versus without RTS,S/AS01E as part of an EPI regimen. 
Criteria for non-inferiority: one month post Dose 3, UL of the 2-sided 95%CI on the geometric 
mean  concentration  (GMC)  ratios  of  10  pneumococcal  serotypes  concentrations  (measured 
with  an  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  [ELISA]  test),  is  below  a  limit  of  2  for  the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when co-administered with versus without RTS,S/AS01E. 
To describe the antibody responses to the 10 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 
18C,  19F  and  23F),  measured  by  ELISA  and  opsonophagocytic  assay  (OPA),  when  the 
pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  is  co-administered with  and  without  RTS,S/AS01E  as  part  of 
an EPI regimen.  
To  describe  the  antibody  response  to  the  Protein  D  (PD)  component  of  the  pneumococcal 
conjugate  vaccine  when  co-administered  with  versus  without  RTS,S/AS01E  as  part  of  an  EPI

regimen. 
A  number  of  other  objectives  were  also  included  in  the  study,  but  as  these  were  not  related  to 
Synflorix they will not be assessed within this procedure.  
Safety 
• 
Evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  RTS,S/AS01E  candidate  malaria  vaccine,  when 
coadministered  with  a  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  or  a  rotavirus  vaccine  integrated  into 
an EPI regimen. 
Study design 
Subjects were randomized into 11 study groups in a 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 3 : 3 ratio (this means five 
treatment groups of which the three RTS,S/AS01E groups were randomized to receive three different 
lots).

Blood sampling: 
•  Groups RERo[P], RE[RoP] and HERo[P] will have a total of seven blood samples taken: at Visit 
1 (screening) and Visit 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 (post Dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B). 
•  Groups REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro] will have a total of 8 blood samples taken: at Visit 1 (screening) 
and Visit 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (post Dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B). 
•  Blood for safety evaluation was collected at screening (Visit 1) to ensure healthy children were 
recruited. 
Study population /Sample size 
Male or female infants between 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination free of obvious 
health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination  before  entering  into  the 
study,  who  were  born  to  a  mother  seronegative  for  HBsAg  and  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV) 
and  for  whom  the  investigator  believed  that  the  parents/Legally  acceptable  representatives  (LARs) 
would  comply  with  the  requirements  of the  protocol.  Results  of laboratory  screening  tests  for  alanine 
aminotransferase  (ALT),  creatinine,  hemoglobin,  platelets  count  and  total  white  cell  count  had  to  be

tetanus,  B.  pertussis  (whole-cell  or  acellular),  Haemophilus  influenzae  type  B,  Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, hepatitis B vaccine or rotavirus vaccine. Signed or thumb-printed informed consent was 
obtained from the parents/LARs of each subject. 
A total of 705 subjects (141 per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled in order to have at least 
600 evaluable subjects (approximately 120 subjects in each treatment group).

Statistical Methods 
Antibodies against pneumococcal conjugate vaccine antigens: non-inferiority of pneumococcal antigens 
responses 
The  95%  CI  of  the  antibody  GMC  ratio  (HEP[Ro]  over  REP[Ro])  was  calculated  for  each  of  the  10 
serotypes (ELISA) one month post Dose 3 of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. If the UL of this CI was 
below 2, non-inferiority was concluded.

Assessor’s comment: The immunogenicity results relating to the 10 pneumococcal antigens are well in 
agreement  with  previously  reported  results.  Statistical  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated  for  all 
serotypes except 18C, although there is no regulatory consequence of these results.

All  other  solicited  general  symptoms  related  to  vaccination  were  reported  after  ≤0.5%  of 
vaccine dose. 
•  Over  a  30-day  follow-up  period  (day  of  vaccination  and  29  subsequent  days),  at  least  one 
unsolicited  AE  was  reported  by  85.2%,  81.0%  and  85.1%  in  REP[Ro],  RERo[P]  and  RE[RoP] 
groups  and  85.1%  and  75.5%  in  HEP[Ro]  and  HERo[P]  groups.  Malaria,  gastroenteritis, 
bronchitis,  rhinitis,  and  pharyngitis  were  the  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AE  in  each 
groups. 
• 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  Grade  3  unsolicited  AE  within  30  days  post 
vaccination was 0.7%, 1.4% and 1.4% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups and 0.7% and 
1.4%  in  HEP[Ro]  and  HERo[P]  groups.  Bronchopneumonia  and  gastroenteritis  and  were  the 
most frequently reported Grade 3 unsolicited AEs (3 and 2 subjects respectively). 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE  related  to  vaccination  within 
30 days post vaccination was 0.7%, 0.7% and 3.5% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups 
and 2.1% and 4.3% in HEP[Ro] and HERo[P] groups. Pyrexia was the most frequently reported 
unsolicited  AEs  related  to  vaccination  in  each  groups  (1  subject  in  REP[Ro]  and  RERo[P] 
groups,  5  subjects  in  RE[RoP]  group,  3  subjects  in  HEP[Ro]  group  and  6  subjects  in  HERo[P] 
group). 
• 
From Dose 1 until 8 months post Dose 1 (Visit 9), the percentage of subjects reporting at least 
one  SAE  was  0.7%,  4.9%  and  5.0%  in  REP[Ro],  RERo[P]  and  RE[RoP]  groups  and  2.1%  and 
3.6%  in  HEP[Ro]  and  HERo[P]  groups.  Bronchopneumonia  and  gastroenteritis  were  the  most 
frequently reported SAEs (6 and 5 subjects respectively). None of the SAEs were judged to be 
related to vaccination. 
•  Over  a  30-day  follow-up  period  (day  of  vaccination  and  29  subsequent  days),  4  fatal  SAEs 
were reported in 2 subjects vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E vaccine (1 subject in REP[Ro] and 1 
subject in RE[RoP]). None of these fatal SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination.

• 
From  the  start  of  the  study  until  Month  8  (Visit  9),  there  were  8  fatal  SAEs  reported  in  5 
subjects  vaccinated  with  RTS,S/AS01E  vaccine  (1  subject  in  REP[Ro],  2  subjects  in  RERo[P] 
and 2 subjects in RE[RoP]). None of these fatal SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination. 
•  No potential immune mediated disorders were reported from the start of the study until Month 
8 (Visit 9). 
Assessor’s  comment:  There  were  no  new  safety  issues  for  Synflorix  based  on  the  results  of  this 
study.  
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  current  study  was  a  study  of  an  experimental  malaria  vaccine,  and  Synflorix  was  one  of  several 
vaccines included to study concomitant vaccination. A total of 425 subjects received at least one dose 
of  Synflorix  co-administered  with  the  RTS,S  vaccine  and  other  vaccines  and  279  subjects  received  at 
least  one  dose  of  Synflorix  co-administered  with  Engerix-B  and  other  vaccines.  Thus,  the  addition  of 
these  results  to  the  already  presented  extensive  amount  of  data  does  not  impact  the  benefit  risk  of 
Synflorix. The immune responses did not cause concern of lack of efficacy, and the safety dada did not 
give rise to new safety concerns. No further regulatory action is considered necessary.

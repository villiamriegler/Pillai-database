Summary of the risk management plan for Tafinlar (dabrafenib) 
This  is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for dabrafenib. The RMP 
details important risks of dabrafenib, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  dabrafenib’s  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information).
Dabrafenib summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how dabrafenib 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for dabrafenib should be read in the context of all this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of dabrafenib RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Tafinlar  contains  dabrafenib  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  used  for  in  the 
following indications:
 Dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib is indicated 
for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.
 Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is indicated for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer 
(NSCLC) with BRAF V600 mutation.
 Adjuvant treatment of adult patients with stage III melanoma with a BRAF 
V600 mutation, following complete resection
The  recommended  dose  of  dabrafenib,  either  used  as  monotherapy  or  in 
combination  with  trametinib,  is  150 mg  (two  75 mg  capsules)  twice  daily 
(corresponding  to  a  total  daily  dose  of  300 mg).  The  recommended  dose  of 
trametinib, when used in combination with dabrafenib, is 2 mg once daily.
Further information about the evaluation of dabrafenib’s benefits can be found in 
dabrafenib’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage link to product’s EPAR summary landing

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks
Important risks of dabrafenib, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  dabrafenib’  s risks,  are  outlined 
below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  dabrafenib  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can  be  safely  taken.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of dabrafenib. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the 
use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Failure
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, renal toxicity (tubular deposits, 
increased incidence of cortical cysts and tubular basophilia and 
reversible increases in urea and/or creatinine concentrations) was 
observed (≥0.2 times adult human clinical exposure based on AUC).
Renal failure has been identified in <1% of patients treated with 
dabrafenib alone and in ≤1% of patients treated with dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
No  specific  risk  groups  were  identified  during  clinical  trials.  Risk 
factors  may  include  pyrexia,  dehydration  with  pre-renal  azotemia 
and/or hypotension.

In rats and rabbits given trametinib monotherapy, maternal and 
developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weights and increased 
ossification variations) were observed at exposures below the 
exposures achieved at the recommended clinical dose of 2 mg per 
day. Additionally, decreased corpora lutea were observed in rats 
given trametinib, which may impact female fertility. It is not known 
whether these effects will also be seen in humans.

Risk minimization 
measures
In clinical trial pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis 
(PE/DVT) events were reported in 3% of the subjects (6/209) on 
trametinib and dabrafenib combination therapy.
Risk factors include history or family history of VTE, immobilization, 
increased  age  (>60  years),  those  on  estrogen-based  compounds, 
recent  surgery  and  cancer.  Therefore,  patients  with  metastatic 
melanoma are at risk from the nature of their disease.

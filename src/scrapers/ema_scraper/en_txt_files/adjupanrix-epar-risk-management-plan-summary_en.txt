PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Adjupanrix (Pandemic influenza vaccine 
(H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) ) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Adjupanrix. The RMP details 
important risks of Adjupanrix, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Adjupanrix 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Adjupanrix's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Adjupanrix should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Adjupanrix should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Adjupanrix's RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Adjupanrix is authorised for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic 
situation. (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains Pandemic Influenza Vaccine (H5N1) 
(Split Virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) as the active substance and it is given by intramuscular 
injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Adjupanrix’s benefits can be found in Adjupanrix’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: 
‘internet site’.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/adjupanrix-previously-pandemic-
influenza-vaccine-h5n1-split-virion-inactivated-adjuvanted 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Adjupanrix, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Adjupanrix's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
  
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Adjupanrix, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessmentso that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine PhV activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Adjupanrix is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Adjupanrix are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Adjupanrix. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Since the last RMP for Adjupanrix was published, the risk of solid organ transplant rejection 
has been removed with agreement from the CHMP, based on the results of an epidemiological 
study which found no increased risk of solid organ transplant rejection following vaccination 
with Adjupanrix.  Several other risks were also removed including fever, vaccination 
failure/effectiveness, medical errors/misidentification of vaccine, contamination of multidose 
vials and coring of the rubber stopper on the antigen vial.  These were removed as they were 
deemed to be either adequately addressed by the product information included with the 
vaccine, or they were not considered significant safety concerns.

Autoimmune hepatitis 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Two reported cases of AIH were received from GSK clinical trials of H5N1+AS03 
vaccines. One report, concerning a female child, 3.5 years of age, was received 
from a clinical trial using the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain and was determined to 
be an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. The second report, concerning an 
adult male, 29 years of age, was received from a clinical trial using the 
A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain; a liver biopsy showed a mild, chronic hepatitis 
compatible with AIH, baseline values of transaminases were not available. No 
signal for AIH was identified during post-marketing use of GSK’s AS03-adjuvanted 
H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. No events were reported for the doses of D-
Pan H5N1 AS03 adjuvanted vaccines administered for 78 personnel deemed at 
risk. 
None known; AIH occurs in persons of all ages, sexes, and races [Hennes , 2008]. 
In the absence of definitive biological and epidemiological data, Tavares Da Silva, 
et al. proposed one year as the maximum, reasonable theoretical risk interval for 
incident potential immune-mediated diseases [Tavares Da Silva , 2013].

Bell’s palsy 
Evidence for linking the risk to the

The incidence rate is not well established. Rates in the literature range from 13 to 
43/100,000 person-years. Cumulatively, one SAE of Bell’s Palsy (LLT)/Facial 
Paralysis (PT) was reported in GSK’s H5N1 clinical trials. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Bell’s palsy can affect all age groups and genders. There are no known 
background factors that alter an individual’s risk for developing Bell’s palsy. Most 
cases are idiopathic. Known associations with HIV infection, Lyme disease, 
sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, acute otitis media, tumour, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and trauma. Pregnancy and certain viral illnesses (especially 
herpes viruses) can also be associated with Bell’s palsy [Greco , 2012].

Convulsion 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Febrile seizures are the most common type of non-epileptic seizures observed 
after vaccination. Approximately 3% to 4% of all typically-developing children aged 
3 months through 6 years will have at least one febrile seizure [Bonhoeffer , 
2004].In clinical studies of H5N1 adjuvanted vaccine, there have been 7 SAEs of 
febrile convulsion reported in 4 subjects associated with fever in children. Four 
SAEs of seizure were reported in clinical studies of H5N1 adjuvanted vaccines, 
none was considered related to the vaccine. 
To date, there are no cumulative spontaneous or post-marketing reports as 
Adjupanrix has not been commercially launched 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Age 3 months through 6 years, with peak incidence at 9-20 months of age [Cross , 
2012]. Genetic susceptibility; siblings have a 25% risk [Cross , 2012].

Demyelinating disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Varies with type of disorder. The most common type, Multiple Sclerosis, varies 
markedly geographically, from below 5/100 000 in many areas of Africa, South 
America and Asia, to over 100/100 000 in Scotland and parts of Scandinavia and 
Canada [Love , 2006]. 
A GSK-supported study of Arepanrix H1N1 (EPI-FLU-010 (Swedish PASS)) found 
no evidence of an association between vaccination with and the incidence of MS 
or of other CNS demyelinating conditions. In clinical studies with GSK’s H5N1 
pandemic influenza vaccine, 2 cases of demyelination were reported. MS of new 
onset was reported in a 38-year-old subject 1 year after vaccination, and one case 
of optic neuritis was reported in a 21-year-old subject, 943 days after the second 
dose of vaccine, which resolved with treatment.

Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The term encompasses several disorders, infectious and non-infectious in nature; 
as well as acute and chronic. Rates of viral encephalitis in the literature range from 
<1 to 7/100,000 [Sejvar , 2007], with an incidence of 3.5 and 7.4 per 100,000 
patient-years [Granerod , 2007]. A multicentre population-based prospective study 
found that 21% of subjects with acute encephalitis had an immune-mediated 
etiology; and 38% of those had anti-neuronal antibodies present [Armangue , 
2014]. Cumulatively, no SAEs related to encephalitis were reported in clinical trials 
of GSK H5N1 adjuvanted vaccines. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Possibly geographical proximity to endemic disease vectors.

Guillain-Barre Syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The annual incidence of GBS in the general population has been estimated to be 
1 to 2 per 100,000 [Sejvar , 2011]. It has been estimated that seasonal influenza 
vaccines are associated with approximately 1 excess case per million persons 
vaccinated [CDC, 2010]. Cumulatively, no SAEs related to GBS were reported in 
clinical trials of GSK’s H5N1 adjuvanted vaccine. Spontaneous reports of GBS 
have been received following vaccination with GSK’s H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine); 
however, a causal association between vaccination and GBS has not been 
established. Data from a post-marketing epidemiological study in Canada indicate 
a small but significant increased relative risk of GBS of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.63-4.62) in 
the 56-day period following vaccination with Arepanrix H1N1 (in persons 50 years 
of age and older). The number of GBS cases attributable to vaccination was 
approximately 2 per 1 million doses. 
Slight male predominance, with a ratio of men to women of 1.78 [95% CI, 1.36-
2.33]. Two-thirds of cases have a history of episodes of gastrointestinal or upper 
respiratory infections 3 days to 6 weeks before onset. CMV and Campylobacter 
jejuni infections have been implicated in up to 10% and 30% of cases, 
respectively. Epstein-Barr, varicella-zoster and mycoplasma pneumonia infections 
have also been associated with GBS syndrome [Yuki , 2012]. The incidence rises 
through the first 20 years of life and is stable again until the 7th decade, when the 
incidence is highest, and morbidity greatest

Increased concentrations of hepatic enzymes 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Abnormal elevations of serum liver chemistries may occur in 1% to 4% of the 
asymptomatic population. There are numerous causes of increased 
concentrations of transaminases [AGACPC, 2002]. Five cases in 4 patients 
involving increased concentrations of hepatic enzymes following vaccination with 
GSK’s AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine have been reported from clinical trials. 
Two cases were from the same patient who was initially thought to have Burkitt’s 
lymphoma, whose disease progressed to multi-organ failure.  One case of drug-
induced liver injury occurred in another subject 9 months after the second dose of 
H5N1 vaccine.  A subsequent positive rechallenge with nitrofurantoin was 
considered causal.  Two other cases were of autoimmune hepatitis.  Both subjects 
were subsequently found to have evidence of hepatic disease preceding 
vaccination.  
There is no evidence from clinical trial data of a direct hepatotoxic effect of the 
AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine. Abnormal elevations of serum liver chemistries 
may occur in 1% to 4% of the asymptomatic population. Increased concentrations 
of hepatic enzymes are closely monitored by GSK as part of the close monitoring 
for AIH. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Concentrations of transaminases may be increased due to infections, alcohol 
consumption, drugs, strenuous exercise, steatosis, and many chronic medical 
conditions [AGACPC, 2002].

Narcolepsy 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Studies from Europe found an increase in relative risk of narcolepsy, in those 
vaccinated withH1N1 Pandemrix compared to those unvaccinated, in the 
population under 20 years of age. The relative risk (RR) estimates ranged from 1.6 
to 14.4, and the CI varied widely, from 0.3 to 48.5 The values translated into an 
absolute attributable risk of narcolepsy of approximately 1.4 to 8 additional cases 
per 100,000 vaccinated children/adolescents, and approximately 1 additional case 
per 100,000 vaccinated adults. [Sturkenboom , 2015]. Narcolepsy affects 
approximately 0.02% of the population worldwide [Mahlios , 2013]. The overall 
pooled incidence rate in Europe is 0.93 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.90 – 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
0.97). A major peak occurs in persons 15 to 30 years of age, with a less 
pronounced peak at 60 years of age [Wijnans , 2013]. In a US study, which 
stratified the incident rate by age and gender, the rate of narcolepsy per 100,000-
person years was 1.37 (1.72 for men and 1.05 for women) and was found to be 
highest in the 2nd decade, followed in descending order by the 3rd, 4th and 1st 
decades [Sha ,2016;Silber Silber , 2002].  Narcolepsy has not been reported in 
any subject in a GSK clinical study with pandemic influenza H5N1 vaccine. 
Narcolepsy with cataplexy is linked with genetic susceptibility factors such as HLA 
DQB1*0602, frequently in combination with HLA DRB1*15:01 [Mahlios , 2013]. 
Other reported immunological associations include polymorphisms in the T cell 
receptor alpha locus, in Cathepsin H, an enzyme expressed in antigen presenting 
cells and within the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily OX40L [Mahlios 
2013].

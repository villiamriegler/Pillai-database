2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare genetic disease. Patients with XLH have inactivating mutations 
of the PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome), 
which alters the phosphate-sensing control system, leads to chronic renal phosphate wasting, 
hypophosphataemia, and defective bone mineralisation manifesting as rickets and osteomalacia, and may 
also impact other tissues.   
2.1.2.  Epidemiology   
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare (incidence estimated to 1/200000 new-borns), chronic 
deforming bone disease. X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a dominant disorder and accounts for more 
than 80% of all familial hypophosphataemia. Although serum phosphate levels are similarly depressed in 
affected males and females, the degree of bone involvement is substantially less severe in heterozygous 
females. All hemizygous males are clinically affected. As in all genetic disorders, hypophosphataemic rickets 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 10/130 
  
  
 
is present from conception. In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets 
begin in early childhood. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
XLH is characterized by excess levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to increased 
urinary phosphate excretion, reduced 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, and subsequent hypophosphataemia. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The features of the disorder can vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly 
affected individuals may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms. In children, the main 
clinical consequences of the disease are rickets, lower extremity skeletal deformities, gait abnormalities and 
loss of growth potential. In adulthood, the disease is associated with osteomalacia, musculoskeletal 
pain/stiffness and dental abscesses. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no approved or available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated 
FGF23-induced hypophosphataemia in XLH. Most children with XLH receive conventional therapy consisting of 
multiple daily doses of oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues. Skeletal abnormalities in children with 
XLH often require surgical correction.  
There is no consensus regarding treatment of adult patients because of concern about safety issues and lack 
of clinical studies demonstrating efficacy with conventional therapy. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Burosumab (KRN23) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the excess 
biological activity of FGF23. The aim of the therapy is to minimise the clinical consequences of the disease by 
restoring normal serum phosphate levels. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The Applicant requested a Conditional Marketing Authorisation based on Article 2(3) of Commission 
Regulation 507/2006 with the following rational to justify its claim: 
- KRN23 (burosumab) for XLH was designated as an orphan medicinal product under Regulation (EC) 
141/2000 on 15 October 2014 and therefore falls within the categories specified under the conditional 
marketing authorisation regulation.  
- X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare, serious, chronic and debilitating genetic disorder. Chronic 
hypophosphataemia in XLH leads to defective bone mineralisation that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia 
with subsequent bowing of the leg, physical disability, and decreased height. XLH is also associated with pain, 
stiffness, fatigue, and functional limitations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 11/130 
  
  
- With regards to the unmet medical need, it will be addressed, according to the applicant: No approved or 
available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated FGF23-induced 
hypophosphataemia exists. Conventional therapy for paediatric patients with XLH consists of multiple daily 
doses of oral phosphate, often combined with active vitamin D. Conventional therapy is associated with 
adverse outcomes and can be cumbersome for healthcare professionals to manage and for patients to comply 
with, and only a partial benefit on skeletal disease is observed. Data provided by the applicant at time of 
submission of the application suggests that treatment with KRN23 (burosumab) improves serum phosphate 
levels and bone mineralisation and are expected to reduce the diverse skeletal and other manifestations 
associated with hypophosphataemia in XLH patients. 
The applicant proposed the completion of the following studies to be considered as specific obligations in the 
framework of a Conditional Marketing Authorisation: 
- UX023-CL201: A Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Finding, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics 
and Safety of the Anti-FGF23 Antibody, KRN23, in Paediatric Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH); 
- UX023-CL205: An Open-Label, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of 
KRN23 in Children from 1 to 4 Years Old with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH); 
- UX023-CL301: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of KRN23 
Versus Oral Phosphate and Active Vitamin D Treatment in Paediatric Patients with X-linked 
Hypophosphatemia (XLH).  
The applicant argued that study 301 represents a comprehensive Phase 3 program in paediatric patients with 
XLH to confirm the positive risk/benefit profile observed in the Phase 1 and 2 studies, including the 2 other 
phase 2 studies listed above, the completion of which were also considered key to benefit/risk. It is likely that 
the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data in a pre-specified timeframe as all 3 studies had 
completed recruitment at time of submission of this procedure. 
The applicant argued that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Based on the evidence presented at the time of 
submission of the dossier, the applicant argued that substantial improvement in rickets, growth, and physical 
function, and the reduction in patient-reported symptoms such as pain, and an acceptable safety profile, 
justifies early availability of such treatment. Earlier treatment would also lead to better long-term outcomes, 
according to literature, in particular, as severe bone deformities once progressed and finally fixed with 
closure of the growth plates cannot be readily reversed and could leave children with life-long deformities and 
disabilities.

stopper, and aluminium seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Burosumab is a human Immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) type antibody with a relative molecular mass of 
approx. 147 kDa. Burosumab is expressed in CHO cells and is composed of two heavy chain (γ1-chain) 
molecules and two LC (κ-chain) molecules. The two HCs are connected together by two covalent disulfide 
bonds, while the HC and LC are linked through a single disulfide bond. Burosumab has the typical disulfide 
bond structure of a human IgG1 with the characteristic disulfide bond pattern. Each HC contains an N-linked 
oligosaccharide at the canonical glycosylation site at N297.  
Burosumab is a neutralizing antibody against soluble Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) only. It has 
recombinant fully human complementarity determining regions (CDRs) derived from mouse anti-human 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) using KM Mouse® technology. Each CDR binds to excess FGF23 secreted 
in biological fluid. At a cellular level, the FGF23 binds to FGF23 receptor (FGFR1) and Klotho, and then 
induces the signal pathway through the receptor. Burosumab also has constant regions derived from human 
IgG1 which are known to extend circulating half-life through binding to the FcRn. 
The mechanisms of action (MoA) of burosumab (also called KRN23) is neutralization of excess FGF23, thus 
inhibiting an interaction between soluble FGF23 and FGF23 receptor complex on the cell surface. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Burosumab active substance is produced at Kyowa Hakki Kirin Co.Ltd. located in Gunma, Japan.  
During the procedure a pre-authorisation inspection was carried out on 29-05-2017 to 01-06-2017 by the 
Finnish Medicine Agency (fimea), the Competent Authorities of Finland. On the basis of the inspection it can 
be confirmed that the operations are in general compliance with the principles and guidelines of good 
manufacturing practice as laid down in Commission Directive 2003/94/EC. 
Description of the manufacturing process  
Burosumab active substance (AS) commercial manufacturing process constitutes of three main parts: 1) 
upstream cell culture process, 2) downstream purification process, and 3) filtration and storage. Burosumab 
AS is filled in bags and shipped from the AS manufacturing site to the FP manufacturing site in the same area 
of the Takasaki Plant. The shipping method is qualified to keep the AS in a frozen state under the specified 
temperature range and operating time. 
The media used in the upstream cell culture process do not contain any materials of animal origin and are 
tested according to in-house requirements. Starting materials used in the preparation of buffers for 
downstream processing comply with pharmacopoeial requirements or manufacturer’s specification, and do 
not contain any materials of animal origin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 13/130 
  
  
 
In general, the burosumab AS manufacturing process and controls are considered to be appropriately 
described.  
The definition of acceptable ranges in the application has been revised to reflect the univariate process 
characterization, i.e. variation allowed in not more than one parameter at a time. There is no claim for design 
space. The proposed definitions are aligned with ICH Q8 and considered acceptable.   
The origin of the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein has been sufficiently described. The steps in the 
assembly of the expression construct have also been described in detail, as well as the origin of cells and the 
cell banking system. The characterisation of MCB and WCB has been described in detail and in general 
comply with requirements laid down in ICH Q5A and Q5D.  
No raw materials of biological origin are used in the AS manufacturing process or in the establishment of the 
cell banks (the Master Cell Bank [MCB] and Working Cell Bank [WCB]). The source of the protein A is a 
recombinant protein produced in E. coli as the host cell. Protein A is purified with conventional 
chromatography. The protein A is manufactured free of animal-derived components. 
The information submitted regarding raw materials and reagents is considered to be adequate. 
Process controls and control strategy 
The commercial process control strategy was proposed after the process characterization (PC) studies and 
confirmed by the process performance qualification (PPQ). Process control is assured through in-process 
control (IPC) testing with rejection and/or action limits. In addition, in-process monitoring (IPM) is used for 
process monitoring and trending purpose with internal alert limits. When a result of an IPC testing does not 
meet an action, it triggers an investigation in accordance with internal quality management systems and 
procedures, to determine the potential impact on product quality. IPM and the internal limits as provided in 
Section 3.2.S.2.4 may be changed under the internal quality system by accumulating and periodically 
evaluating the relevant data as per the continued process verification (CPV) program. 
Furthermore, risk-based approaches, which included identification of the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), 
and assessment of the criticality of the Performance Attributes (PAs) and the process parameters, were 
employed during the establishment of the control strategy. 
CQAs identification, PA criticality assessment, process parameter (PP) criticality assessment and material 
attributes criticality assessment have been reviewed and reassessed based on the acquired knowledge and 
manufacturing experience and will continue to be updated periodically as part of the commercial lifecycle 
approach. 
The in-process testing approach and the link to attributes are explained. IPCs with action/rejection limits and 
IPMs with internal limits are listed for all manufacturing steps, including rationales for selection of in-process 
testing strategy. Upon request, the Applicant has clarified that a batch that fails to meet rejection limits will 
be rejected.  
The updated proposal for IPC limits is acceptable, as is the updated control strategy with an extension of the 
drug substance specification. In the current version, there are less IPC controls (however reasonable in-
process monitoring) and more specification controls. The control strategy is presented, and in-house terms 
defined in relation to ICH Q8. The use of two terms, CQA and IPQA, with the same meaning makes the 
structure of the control strategy unnecessary complicated, however the overall meaning of the actual 
classification of parameters and attributes are agreeable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 14/130 
  
  
The concept of performance attributes in connection with process consistency is understood, thus the 
definition of the process performance attribute, PPA, and the criticality levels ‘key PPA’ and ‘non-key PPA’, is 
acceptable. It is noted, however, that there may be cases when it is difficult to conclude if a process 
parameter has impact on a key performance attribute or slight impact on a critical performance 
attribute/critical quality attribute. 
Process validation 
The control strategy was validated by demonstrating that the results met the PPQ acceptance criteria with 
the qualified facility, equipment, and utilities. Manufacture of a number of lots of PPQ was proposed to 
confirm the consistency in terms of product quality and process performance. The process performance 
qualification of the manufacturing steps for burosumab is considered to be adequately described and 
reported. The approach for setting PPQ acceptance criteria, tolerance intervals based on a limited number of 
batches, is not fully supported as use of tolerance intervals requires more data points. However, the actual 
PPQ results are generally concentrated in quite narrow ranges and the PPQ is, over all, considered 
approvable. 
In-process pool hold times were studied in full scale during PPQ. The conclusion that there was no significant 
change in any performance attributes during the hold time is supported. 
Process performance qualifications for media hold, buffer hold, mixing, and uniformity of filled bulk are 
sufficiently described and the conclusions supported. 
Frozen AS is transported within the same plant for finished product manufacturing. The transport has been 
qualified to assure that AS is kept frozen and that there are no effects on quality.  
The data submitted in support of the shipping qualification is acceptable. 
Reprocessing in case of technical failure (integrity test failure or facility/equipment failure) for a proposed 
manufacturing step is briefly described. This approach is acceptable. Small scale data supporting the 
proposed reprocessing has been submitted, which reveals that there is no significant difference between 
filtration pool and re-filtration pool regarding the product quality. The conclusion is supported.  
Process development and characterisation  
The approach to process development and characterization is described, including further identification and 
classification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and process performance attributes (IPQAs and PPAs, 
impurities, product-related substances, general requirements, formulation-related attributes, process 
consistency attributes). 
The CQAs for the AS were identified based on the assessment of CQAs for the final FP to meet the quality 
target product profile. The CQAs that must be controlled within an appropriate range during the AS 
manufacturing stage to ensure the final product maintains desired quality were specified. The CQAs are 
categorized into five groups: 
Univariate and multivariate experiments were performed during process characterisation, however the 
manufacturing description is based on a univariate approach (see also the revised definition of acceptable 
ranges). 
The approach for evaluation of column cleaning and reuse is acceptable and the conclusions that results were 
equivalent between the start of the small scale studies and after the suggested number of reuse cycles are 
supported.

Active substance characterisation 
The AS has been comprehensively characterized in accordance with the ICH Q6B and the CHMP guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/157653/2007: Guideline on Development, Production, Characterisation and Specifications 
for Monoclonal Antibodies and Related Products. State-of-the-art analytical procedures have been employed 
to confirm the structural, physicochemical, and the biological activities of burosumab. 
All characterization studies were performed using AS lot 1502YU, unless otherwise specified. This lot was 
designated as the primary Reference Standard (RS) (lot SYUA-03) and the working RS (lot SYUA-04). 
Additional burosumab AS lots were analysed in order to demonstrate manufacturing consistency. 
The entire amino acid sequence of burosumab exactly matched the theoretical amino acid sequence predicted 
from the KRN23 DNA sequence. The N-glycosylation- site was N297 on each HC and the main oligosaccharide 
structures were asialo-, biantennary, and fucosylated complex type structures containing 0, 1, and 2 
galactose residues. 
The analyses of secondary and tertiary structure suggest the presence of a secondary structure which 
includes multiple β-sheet structures in burosumab.  
The biological properties of burosumab were evaluated using binding affinity and cell-based assays to 
characterise its binding through both the CDR and Fc regions. 
Minor variants were characterised by structural analysis and potency measurement for each variant. Stress 
studies were also performed to identify the possible degradation profile. 
Impurity characterization of burosumab is comprehensive. The identified variants were classified as either 
product-related impurities or as product-related substances based on a criticality assessment of each 
variant’s potential impact to the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of KRN23. 
The burosumab AS characterization is considered to be comprehensive and attributes of different variants 
were analysed by orthogonal methods. The classification of product-related substances and product-related 
impurities is accepted. 
Specification 
The AS shelf-life specification will be used as the specification for the post-approval stability protocol. All test 
items, test methods, and acceptance criteria in the shelf-life specification are identical to those in the release 
specification except for the exclusion of glycol-variants, identity and bacterial endotoxins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 16/130 
  
  
The commercial specification for burosumab AS was established as a part of the overall control strategy to 
assure the process performance and product quality of the burosumab AS. The proposed commercial 
specification  as part of the overall control strategy of the AS reflects the product knowledge acquired 
throughout development and focuses on those quality attributes that are the most important to monitor. 
The analytical method descriptions and method validations are considered to be adequate.  
Batch analyses for lots run according to process versions 1 to 4 are provided. All lots were tested to the 
specification in place at the time of product release. Further batch data regarding attributes not contained in 
the specifications is included in the dossier. Reasonable lot-to-lot consistency has been demonstrated.  
Reference Standard 
The history of burosumab Reference Standards (RSs) is given. A two-tiered RS system is used which consists 
of a Primary Reference Standard (PRS) and a Working Reference Standard (WRS) for commercial 
manufacturing. The PRS and WRS have been collected from the same AS batch. The specification and results 
of qualification are provided. For qualification of the potency of PRS the previous RS lot SYUA-02 was used as 
a reference standard. The qualification and further characterization of the PRS is found acceptable.  
Requalification will be conducted annually. Based on the results of the requalification, further use of the PRS 
may be extended The future establishment and control of future WRS has been outlined and the same 
specification as required for SYUA-04 will apply. The approach on requalification and WRS as described by the 
Applicant is considered to be acceptable. 
Stability 
The Applicant claims an AS shelf life of 24 months at -40 °C. 
Long-term stability studies at were performed as per the ICH Q1A and Q5C. In addition, stability studies were 
conducted under elevated and stress  conditions to evaluate the effect on the AS quality. The container 
closure system used to package the stability samples is identical to the commercial FP container closure 
system. 
For the stability testing, a subset of the AS release testing is performed. Acceptance criteria are based upon 
the acceptance criteria used for AS release specification, which has been revised from the development 
phase. Changes seen under elevated and stress conditions demonstrate that the methods selected are 
stability-indicating. 
Stability data compiled to date confirm that the recommended storage condition is appropriate for long-term 
storage and that the container closure system is compatible with the AS. Updated stability data that supports 
an AS shelf life of 24 months at -40 °C has been provided and the claim for 24 months shelf life at -40 °C is 
supported. 
The ongoing long-term stability studies will be continued by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) through to 
completion. In case of out of specification results, the Applicant will inform EMA. In addition the Applicant 
commits to place and test a minimum of one lot of burosumab manufactured at the commercial site per year 
on the post-approval long-term stability studies at −40 ± 10°C through 36 months.  
The proposal for completion of ongoing long-term stability studies as well as for the first three commercial 
lots has been accepted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 17/130 
  
  
The subjects covered by the description of the stability studies, stability data and post-approval stability 
protocol are appropriate and the chosen analytical methods adequately stability indicating. 
It should be noted that when stability protocols are used for future post-approval process changes, there may 
be need to extend them beyond the protocols depending on the nature of the change. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
An extensive comparability exercise was conducted to link the commercial process (Process 4) to previous 
versions 1, 2 and 3. The comparability includes release testing, further characterisation, in-process testing 
and stability testing. The active substance process changes are clearly outlined and well described, however 
all Process 4 batches are used in ongoing clinical studies. Thus, results and conclusions from the clinical 
experience of Process 4 material are not available in the dossier. The overall conclusion that processes 1, 2 
and 3 can be considered comparable is supported.  
The comparability exercise for Process 3 and Process 4 includes release testing, further characterization, in-
process controls and stability studies. Comparability acceptance criteria for evaluation of process 3 vs process 
4 were based on the numerical overlap approach method which was considered to be acceptable as a 
comparability method.  
The conclusions are acceptable and Process 3 is considered to be comparable to Process 4. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a solution for injection provided in a 5 mL Type I clear borosilicate 
tubing glass vial. Crysvita FP contains burosumab as active substance supplied in three strengths; 10 mg, 20 
mg and 30 mg. Each vial contains 1 ml of the FP solution. 
Other ingredients are L-histidine, D-sorbitol, Polysorbate 80, L-methionine, Hydrochloric acid, 10%  and 
water for injections.  
The product is available as a 1 ml solution in a clear glass vial with butyl rubber stopper, and aluminium seal. 
The FP formulation does not contain any overages. 
The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during the pivotal clinical studies. The 
applicant has satisfactorily addressed comparability between the commercial product and a previous version 
(process 3), which had also been used in some clinical studies. 
All excipients used for the FP formulation are well-known pharmaceutical excipients, compliant with the 
requirements of the relevant USP, Ph.Eur. and JP monographs and there are no novel excipients. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The pharmaceutical development has been detailed and acceptably described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 18/130 
  
  
 
The excipients used in the FP formulation were selected based on prior development experience on other 
monoclonal antibodies (mABs) developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. An extensive formulation 
development was performed and the chosen formulation has been adequately justified. The manufacturing 
development has been described in detail and discussed including the identification of the CQA and design of 
control strategy. The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were identified based on the Quality Target Product 
Profile (QTPP), regulatory requirements, and knowledge gained during the development.  
Performance Attributes (PAs) are classified into In-Process Quality Attributes (IPQAs) and Process 
Performance Attributes (PPAs). As commented above on drug substance the definition IPQA (performance 
attribute directly linked to a CQA) it has been clarified that there is no difference between IPQA and CQA.  
A comprehensive process characterisation was performed and adequately summarized in the dossier. The 
impact of process parameters (PPs) on each performance attribute in the manufacturing process was 
evaluated to understand the manufacturing process, to define criticality of PPs, and to support the 
establishment of the acceptable range of PPs in each process step. The proposed critical and key process 
parameters and their acceptable ranges to be used in process performance qualification (PPQ) manufacturing 
were given. 
The FP manufacturing change history has been acceptably described and changes throughout the 
development satisfactorily justified. All FP batches were manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), 
Takasaki Plant, located in Gunma, Japan. 
A comparability evaluation was performed between FP manufactured with AS derived from process 3 and 
process 4.This is found acceptable and based on the comparison it is agreed that the data from process 3 and 
4 can be considered comparable. 
The suitability of the primary packaging and secondary packaging has also been adequately addressed. The 
vial and stopper complies with Ph.Eur. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The active substance and finished product is manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Takasaki Gunma, 
Japan. 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing of the AS, formulation, bulk filtration (0.22 μm), sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling into vials, stoppering, capping, visual inspection, labelling and packaging. No 
reprocessing is applied for. The manufacturing process and the controls of critical steps are sufficiently 
described. During the procedure information on the shipping conditions for the vials to the labelling and 
packaging facility was added to the description of the manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process and control strategy for the FP were proposed based on prior knowledge and PC 
studies. The process parameters as well as the IPCs and their proposed ranges are found adequate and 
acceptably justified by the PC studies and the PPQ activities.  
The process validation approach is satisfactorily described and considered acceptable. In conclusion, it has 
been demonstrated that the critical process parameters are well controlled, and that the finished product can 
be manufactured to the intended quality and with sufficient consistency and reproducibility. Also each 
processing time has been satisfactorily justified by the processing time establishment study. The in-process 
controls are considered to be adequate.

Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications have been provided.  
Both release and shelf life criteria in the final product specification include appropriate tests. 
The specification was established based on FP batches which are representative of the commercial process. 
The rationale for not including some of the quality attributes in the release specification as well as shelf life 
specification has been addressed. For establishment of the specification limits the tolerance interval approach 
was initially used. Although this approach may be acceptable from a process and analytical capability point of 
view in case of adequate number of batches, the acceptance criteria for attributes of relevance for the safety 
and efficacy should be within the range of clinical experience.  
Impurities 
The control of product-related impurities in FP is found acceptably addressed with the updated specification 
provided during the procedure and it can be concluded that the levels of impurities are in the same range as 
for AS and do not increased during manufacture.  
Characterization of sub-visible particles was performed using two methods Light Obscuration (LO) and Micro 
Flow Imaging (MFI). This was accepted. 
A risk assessment followed by a characterization of elemental impurities was performed. Since no high-risk 
sources were identified through the risk assessment Class 1, Class 2A and Class 3 elements required by the 
ICH Q3D guideline to assess for a parenteral product were evaluated. 
All results for elemental impurities were below the limit of detection and it is agreed that no elemental 
impurities of toxicological concern have been identified and consequently no need for additional controls. 
Analytical methods 
Compendial (Ph.Eur.) methods are used for appearance, pH, osmolality, particle matter and extractable 
volume, and for these methods no descriptions are provided, which is accepted.  
Non-compendial methods have been adequately described. Most methods are identical to the one used on 
the AS. This can be agreed to and no further validation with FP is found necessary. 
Batch results 
Batch results for finished product manufactured with AS from Process 1 to Process 4 have been provided. The 
process 3 batches have been included in clinical studies. Some batches of process 4 (commercial scale) are 
used in on-going clinical trials.  
In general, and where possible due to changes in specification during the development, the data demonstrate 
good comparison between the processes.

Stability of the product 
The Applicant proposes a shelf life of 2 years for Crysvita finished product when stored in a refrigerator (2°C 
to 8°C).  The product should not be frozen and should be stored in the original package and protected from 
light. 
A comprehensive stability program has been presented and the results have been summarised and 
adequately discussed. 
The applicant has provided stability results from batches manufactured according to process 3 and process 4 
(commercial). The long-term studies for both processes are still on-going. 
Long-term studies are performed on several batches. A bracketing design is used in the study. This approach 
is found acceptable. 
In addition, results from accelerated and stress studies have been provided. The stress studies as well as the 
accelerated study are completed.  
All results of long-term conditions provided until now met the acceptance criteria.  
Available results from Process 4 suggest a similar stability profile as those of Process 3 FP lots, which is 
reassuring. 
In conclusion, the data for process 3 supports the proposed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8 °C. 
The data also indicate similar stability profiles for process 3 and process 4 batches as well as similar profile 
for the different strengths.  
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
During the course of the manufacturing process development, four processes have been used to manufacture 
the FP lots. All FP batches were manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), Takasaki Plant, located 
in Gunma, Japan.  Process 1 to Process 3 was used for clinical trial. Process 4 was developed for clinical and 
commercial. However, these clinical trials are on-going and not yet evaluated. Thus, results from the clinical 
experience of Process 4 material are not available in the dossier. Process 2 to 4 uses the same formulation. 
From process 3 to 4 five modifications were introduced which for example includes a new facility, scale up 
and introduction of the 20 mg/ml strength.  
A comparability evaluation was performed between finished product manufactured with AS from process 3 
(batches used in clinical trials) and process 4 (commercial batches and batches used in ongoing clinical 
trials). The results demonstrated that the data from process 3 and 4 by large is comparable.  
Adventitious agents 
No raw materials of human or animal origin were used to establish the producing cell line, prepare the Master 
Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) or manufacture the AS and the FP. There are no excipients of 
human or animal origin in the FP. 
The strategy with regards to adventitious agent safety relies on several measures such as control of raw 
materials, safety testing performed on the MCB, WCB, and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA), IPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 21/130 
  
  
testing of unprocessed bulk and virus validation studies performed on a down scaling model of the 
manufacturing process(clearance studies). 
The testing performed on the MCB, WCB, and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) was performed in 
accordance with the ICH Guidelines Q5A and Q5D. As expected for CHO-cells, Intracytoplasmic A-type 
particles and C-type retrovirus particles were found. This is of no safety concern since both MCB and LIVCA 
cells were negative for retrovirus activity. 
The in-process samples of the unprocessed bulk harvest are controlled for low bioburden, for absence of 
mycoplasma, in vitro detection of adventitious agents (MRC-5, Vero and CHO K1 cells), and qPCR of Minute 
Virus of Mice (MVM). 
The viral clearance studies have been performed in accordance with CPMP/BWP/268/95 and ICH Q5A. Worst 
case settings have been applied for several parameters during the clearance studies to demonstrate 
robustness of virus reduction. The calculation of estimated viral particles per maximum dose demonstrates a 
substantial safety margin. 
The conclusion of the studies was that effective reduction of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses is 
achieved in the manufacturing process. 
GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the procedure one major objection was raised as well as a number of other concerns. The major 
objection, which related to the verification of acceptable GMP status for the manufacturing sites used for 
active substance and finished product, has been adequately addressed. 
All remaining concerns have also been satisfactorily resolved. 
Active substance 
The proposed active substance manufacturing process contains the conventional monoclonal antibody 
production process steps. 
The manufacturing process and the materials used are well described and properly validated. Reprocessing in 
case of filter integrity failure or other technical failures before filling is allowed once per step. Crysvita active 
substance has been thoroughly characterised as regards physicochemical and biological properties. Analytical 
methods are properly described and validated. 
Several questions were previously raised regarding the control strategy. However, taking the revisions into 
account, it is now concluded that the proposed control strategy ensures production of AS of consistent and 
approvable quality.  
A comprehensive comparability program is presented to demonstrate that versions of the AS manufacturing 
process are comparable. Overall, Processes 1-4 are concluded to be comparable.  
Data submitted supports a storage period of 24 months at -40 °C.

The pharmaceutical development is found comprehensive and acceptable. The control strategy has been 
acceptably justified. 
The finished product manufacturing change history has been acceptably described and changes throughout 
the development satisfactorily justified. As commented above a comparability evaluation was performed 
between finished product manufactured with AS from process 3 (batches used in clinical trials) and process 4 
(commercial batches and batches used in ongoing clinical trials). The results demonstrated that the data from 
process 3 and 4 by large is comparable.  
The manufacturing process and the controls of critical steps are sufficiently described. It has been

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
KRN23 (burosumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23). In a Biacore competitive binding study it was shown to bind with similar binding affinity (KD~10-11 
M) to human, cynomolgus monkey and rabbit FGF23. KRN23 shows no binding to mouse, rat or dog FGF23. 
In a cell-based assay, KRN inhibited FGF23 signalling with human, monkey and rabbit FGF23 but not with 
mouse or rat FGF23. 
Biacore studies showed that the KRN23/FGF23 complex could bind to Klotho. It is postulated that KRN23 
binds to the FGFR-binding N-terminal domain of FGF23, while the C-terminal domain binds Klotho. 
KRN23 increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels, and decreased urinary phosphate and Ca levels in 
rabbits given a single IV dose of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg of KRN23. Increases in creatinine and blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) levels were observed in animals given 30 mg/kg, and the subsequent mortalities/unscheduled 
euthanasia of 3 animals (30 mg/kg) were attributed to acute renal failure thought to be caused by

nephrocalcinosis. These findings occurred in animals that had elevated serum phosphate levels exceeding 
normal limits, ranging from 8 to 39 mg/dL.  
In adult monkeys, significant increases in serum phosphate, tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate per 
glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) and serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were observed after single IV doses of 
KRN23. The minimum effective dose of KRN23 for increases in serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels was 
estimated to be 0.1 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively, following a single IV dose given to adult monkeys. 
The PK/PD effect of KRN23 was evaluated after intermittent SC administration of 1 mg/kg for 13 weeks (once 
every 2 weeks) in adult and juvenile monkeys. Serum phosphate elevations were slightly higher in juvenile 
animals compared to that in adults, were similar after repeated dosing, and returned to pre-treatment levels 
after a recovery period. KRN23 treatment resulted in increased FGF23 levels, both total FGF23 and free 
FGF23.  
The Hyp mouse is a murine homologue of XLH with a deletion in the 3′ region of the Phex (Phosphate-
Regulating Gene with Homologies to Endopeptidases on the X-chromosome) gene. In addition to elevated 
serum FGF23 levels, these animals display hypophosphataemia, rickets and associated developmental 
abnormalities. The overall pathology of the Hyp mouse bears many similarities to XLH patients, consistent 
with a dysfunction of the PHEX protein. A murine anti-FGF23 antibody was used to characterize the PD effects 
and mode of action of inhibiting FGF23 in Hyp mice. Juvenile male Hyp mice treated with 4 weekly SC doses 
(4 or 16 mg/kg) of a murine anti-FGF23 Ab had significantly elevated serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D 
levels compared with those of control animals. Anti-FGF23 Ab treatment improved growth retardation and 
elongation of femoral and tibial bone. Adult male Hyp mice given 8 weekly SC doses of 4 or 16 mg/kg of 
murine anti-FGF23 Ab had increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels. While anti-FGF23 Ab did not 
correct short bones of adult Hyp mice, it improved bone mineralization. 
Safety pharmacology studies were not performed in separate studies, but safety pharmacology 
parameters (respiratory rate, ECG, blood pressure and cardiac function) were assessed in 14- and 40- 
week repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, at doses ranging from 
0.03 to 30 mg/kg. There were no effects on blood pressure or respiratory rate in any of the studies. No 
ECG effects were observed in the 14-week study or in the 40-week study in juvenile monkeys. In the 
40-week study in adult monkeys, increased heart rate was observed from Week 13 in males 
administered 30 mg/kg. One male showed an abnormal wave form (depressed ST) on ECG at Week 
39. Cardiac function (measured in recovery animals only) showed low left ventricular end-diastolic and 
end-systolic volumes, low stroke volumes and/or ejection fractions in males treated at 30 mg/kg. 
Histopathology revealed myocardial degeneration in these animals. This was associated with ectopic 
mineralization of the myofibers, correlated with hyperphosphataemia (for further discussion, see the 
Toxicology section).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The concentration of KRN23 in rabbit and cynomolgus serum was determined by a chemiluminescence 
immunoassay format using two types of anti-KRN23 antibodies. Anti-KRN23 antibodies in cynomolgus 
monkey serum were determined by a bridging ELISA format, in which anti-KRN23 antibodies were captured 
with KRN23 adsorbed to the wells of a 96-well microplate and detected with biotin conjugated KRN23. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after single dose in cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits. In 
cynomolgus monkeys, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and AUC0-∞ increased in a dose proportional 
manner between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg and half-life (t1/2) ranged from 102 to 172 hours.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 24/130 
  
  
Multiple dose pharmacokinetics was studied in rabbits and monkeys as part of the toxicity studies. In 
cynomolgus monkeys given KRN23 once every 2 weeks at 0.03, 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg for 14 or 40 weeks, 
the AUC0-∞ increased in a dose-dependent manner and other pharmacokinetic parameters showed no obvious 
differences between dose levels after the first dose indicating that the pharmacokinetic profile of KRN23 after 
the first dosing was linear from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg. The AUC and Cmax after the first and final dosing were 
comparable, and thus, no significant accumulation was observed from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of burosumab (KRN23) was characterized in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys via 
single-dose IV (rabbit) injection, and via repeat-dose IV (both species) injection/infusion and SC 
(cynomolgus) injection. The choice of toxicology species was based on in vitro binding affinity data to FGF23. 
For the longer term (40 week) studies, only the cynomolgus monkey was used, which is acceptable based on 
the comparable toxicity profile in rabbits and monkeys. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single IV dose of 3 mg/kg caused the death of one male rabbit on Day 6. Histopathological evaluation 
showed ectopic mineralization in multiple organs (e.g kidney and heart), thrombus formation in the atrium, 
perivascular edema in the heart, lung edema, increased bone resorption, periosteal fibrosis, and bone 
marrow necrosis. Cause of death was considered due to a combination of renal failure, vascular 
mineralization in the heart, and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances as a consequence of mineralization in the 
GI tract.   
Surviving animals at 3 mg/kg (terminally evaluated on Days 14 or 35) showed decreased food consumption 
and body weight, proteinuria, decreased excretion of sodium and chloride in the urine, lower albumin/globulin 
ratio, increased -globulin, decreased chloride, albumin and ALP, and decreased RBC, haematocrit and 
hemoglobin. Histopathological evaluation showed mineralization of the aorta, kidney, lung and stomach, 
sometimes associated with multinucleated giant cells (foreign body reaction). In the kidney, perivascular 
fibrosis, tubular basophila, dilatation and regeneration occurred in association with mineralization.  
Serum inorganic phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D were elevated at > 0.3 mg/kg. Mortality and 
ectopic mineralization occurred at mean serum phosphate levels > 8.6 mg/dL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 25/130 
  
  
 
Repeat-dose toxicity  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits up to 14 weeks, and in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys up 
to 40 weeks, a spectrum of effects related to the primary pharmacology of burosumab was observed. These 
effects were consistent with an exaggerated response to the inhibition of normal FGF23 levels resulting in a 
supraphysiologic increase in serum phosphate.  
Mortalities 
In the 14-week rabbit study, one male dosed at 3 mg/kg IV was found dead on Day 6. Histopathology 
showed mineralization in multiple organs, myocardial degeneration and necrosis, lung edema, and periosteal 
fibrosis and osteoclast proliferation. Cause of death was considered due to renal failure secondary to 
nephrocalcinosis, with mineralization in the heart and lung as contributory factors. This animal had a peak 
serum phosphate level of 14.84 mg/dL.  
In the 40-week study in adult monkeys, one male animal was euthanized at Week 31 due to abnormal gait 
and lateral position, which correlated with ectopic mineralization in the limbs.  
In the 40-week study in juvenile monkeys, one male and one female dosed at 3 mg/kg IV were found dead 
on Days 200 and 273, respectively. No clinical signs were observed preceding death. Necropsy showed 
stomach dilatation in both animals. The Applicant considered cause of death to be due to tympanites 
(meteorism) and unrelated to treatment with burosumab. A third animal, a male, treated at 3 mg/kg SC, was 
euthanized in moribund state on Day 231. Emaciation, tympanites and slight decrease in spontaneous 
activity were observed from Day 225. At necropsy, hydrothorax, ascites, edema in the subcutaneous tissue, 
and white nodules in the lung and liver, were observed. Histopathological evaluation showed parasitic 
granuloma and inflammation in the liver and lungs, and stress-related changes in the adrenal gland and 
thymus. The Applicant considered the moribundity to be caused by a parasite infection and unrelated to drug 
treatment. 
The Applicant was asked to provide further justification for dismissing these three preterminal mortalities in 
high dose juvenile monkeys as incidental. In their response, the Applicant submitted literature references 
describing cases of spontaneous tympanites in laboratory monkeys. It appears to be a similar condition that 
caused the death of the two monkeys treated at 3 mg/kg IV. The etiology seems to be multifactorial, with 
stress as a major contributory factor. While the incidence of tympanites in the juvenile study is clearly above 
the historical control range at the test laboratory, there is no obvious link to burosumab treatment in the 
sense that other monkeys treated at the same dose level did not show any gastrointestinal disturbances, and 
the two monkeys that died showed comparable burosumab-related changes as other animals treated at 3 
mg/kg IV. 
Regarding the third monkey, treated at 3 mg/kg SC, the Applicant argues that tympanites was not a primary 
effect but rather the consequence of a severe parasite infection. The Applicant attributes the fluid 
accumulation in the chest cavity, abdomen and subcutis to hypoalbuminaemia, secondary to liver injury 
caused by parasite infection and inflammation. This seems plausible.  
Ectopic mineralization 
Rabbits 
In rabbits treated with burosumab at 3 mg/kg IV injection, once every second week for 14 weeks, 
mineralization was observed in the aorta, heart, kidney and stomach. Multinucleated giant cells were 
sometimes present in association with the mineral deposits. In the kidney, mineralization was associated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 26/130 
  
  
tubular regeneration and interstitial fibrosis. Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were 
elevated at > 0.03 mg/kg and > 0.3 mg/kg, respectively. Ectopic mineralization occurred at peak serum 
phosphate levels > 8.5 mg/dL (phosphate levels in vehicle-treated controls were 6.2-6.4 mg/dL).  
Adult monkeys 
In adult monkeys treated with burosumab at > 3 mg/kg IV infusion, every second week for 14 weeks, 
mineralization occurred at multiple sites (kidney, lung, choroid plexus, heart, aorta, eye, stomach and other 
tissues). One male at 30 mg/kg had a swollen forepaw due to mineralization in tendons and tendon sheaths, 
and a tracheal mass due to calcinosis circumscripta. Mineralization in the kidney was associated with tubular 
degeneration/regeneration, multinucleated giant cells, and fibrosis, at 30 mg/kg. Elevated phosphorus 
excretion in the urine at 30 mg/kg was possibly related to the renal mineralization. Ectopic mineralization 
occurred at peak mean serum phosphate levels > 11 mg/dL (phosphate levels in vehicle-treated controls 
ranged from 5.2-7.7 mg/dL). Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at > 
0.03 mg/kg and > 0.3 mg/kg, respectively. 
In the 40-week study, one male at 30 mg/kg IV (administered every second week) was euthanized 
preterminally at Week 31, due to ectopic mineralization in the limbs (subcutis, skeletal muscle, joint 
capsules, ligaments) causing abnormal gait and swelling. Other males at 30 mg/kg IV or SC also showed 
abnormal gait and swelling of limbs, correlating with x-ray findings of accumulated material along the bones, 
and ectopic mineralization.  
Ectopic mineralization in subcutaneous tissues and skeletal muscle was observed at > 0.3 mg/kg in males 
and at 30 mg/kg in females. At > 3 mg/kg, mineralization was present in multiple tissues (kidney, testis, 
lung, trachea). In many animals, the mineral deposits were large enough to be visible at necropsy in the 
form of white masses. At the highest dose, 30 mg/kg, there was widespread mineralization involving the 
heart, aorta, eye, liver, spinal cord, urinary bladder, sciatic nerve and stomach.  
Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at > 0.03 mg/kg and > 0.3 mg/kg, 
respectively. The peak mean serum phosphate level at 0.3 mg/kg, the lowest dose where mineralization 
occurred, was 7.5 mg/dL (males). At the high dose (30 mg/kg), the peak mean serum phosphate level was > 
11 mg/dL. In comparison, the mean range in vehicle control animals was 3.0 – 4.7 mg/dL. Increased 
excretion of inorganic phosphorus in the urine at 30 mg/kg was possibly related to renal mineralization.  
Mineralization in the kidney was associated with tubular degeneration/necrosis and regeneration, 
multinucleated epithelium, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation, mainly at 30 mg/kg. Increased kidney 
weight and changes in clinical pathology such as a positive occult blood reaction in urine, and increased 
protein, glucose and sodium excretion in urine, and increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, were 
probably related to these findings. 
Mineralization in the heart at 30 mg/kg IV and SC was associated with increased heart rate in males from 
Week 13, and an abnormal wave form (depressed ST) on ECG in one male at Week 39. Furthermore, males 
dosed at 30 mg/kg showed low left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, low stroke volumes, 
and/or low ejection fractions at the end of the recovery period. This was most likely related to mineralization 
of myofibers/blood vessels in the heart, and/or tunica media in the aorta.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 27/130 
  
  
Overall, ectopic mineralization with associated changes was more severe in males than in females; however, 
there was no clear sex difference in exposure to burosumab. The incidence and severity of treatment-related 
changes were similar in the 30 mg/kg IV and SC groups. 
Juvenile monkeys 
In a 40-week study on juvenile monkeys (6-7 months old), using the same study design as in the adult 40-
week study but with a lower high dose, there were three preterminal mortalities at the highest dose level (3 
mg/kg) (see above). Swelling of the forepaw or hindpaw was noted at 3 mg/kg in a few males, correlating 
with x-ray findings of accumulated material along the digits. A white mass in the subcutis of the swollen 
digits was observed at necropsy in one of these males, being correlated at the microscopic level with 
mineralization. 
Ectopic mineralization in multiple tissues (kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, submandibular gland, eye) occurred 
at 3 mg/kg IV and SC. Mineralization in the kidney was not associated with tubular degeneration or 
inflammation. Elevated urine creatinine, calcium, sodium, potassium and chloride excretion in some animals 
were possibly related to the renal mineralization.  
Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at > 0.03 mg/kg. Ectopic 
mineralization occurred at peak mean serum phosphate levels of 10 mg/dL(mean phosphate levels in 
vehicle-treated controls were in the range of 5.2-7.8 mg/dL).  
The Applicant was asked to discuss whether juvenile monkeys might be more sensitive to ectopic 
mineralization than adult monkeys. In their response, the Applicant presented data showing higher baseline 
phosphate levels in juveniles and more pronounced mineralization in adults at phosphate levels  > 10.5 
mg/dL  It was concluded that adult monkeys were more sensitive than juveniles to elevations in serum 
phosphate. This seems logic considering the higher need/turnover of phosphate for skeletal growth in 
juveniles. Despite a somewhat lower exposure to burosumab in juvenile monkeys at 3 mg/kg, the peak 
serum phosphate levels were comparable or slightly higher in juveniles as compared with adults treated at 3 
mg/kg. Taken together, the data presented by the Applicant does not suggest that juvenile animals (and, by 
extrapolation, the paediatric population) would be more sensitive to ectopic mineralization than adults. 
Effects on bone  
In the 14-week rabbit study, the preterminally dead male at 3 mg/kg showed periosteal fibrosis and 
osteoclast proliferation. Serum calcium was decreased in this animal.  
In the 14-week cynomolgus monkey study, one male at 30 mg/kg showed visible swelling of the femur and 
humerus, which correlated with x-ray findings of calcification deposits along the bones as well as periosteal 
hyperostosis observed at the microscopic level. Bone-specific ALP in serum was decreased in monkeys dosed 
at > 0.3 mg/kg, while osteocalcin (marker for bone formation), cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen 
(CTx; marker for bone resorption), and calcium, were increased at > 3 mg/kg.  
In the 40-week study on adult monkeys, in addition to ectopic mineralization along the bones, there was a 
general thickening of long bones at 30 mg/kg IV and SC, correlating with microscopic changes (basophilia in 
the subperiosteal area/Haversian canals, dilatation of Haversian canals and cortical bone, spongiform 
hyperostosis in cortical bone, decreased trabecular bone in males). Evaluation of the bone using special 
techniques (histomorphometry, pQCT, testing of bone strength) revealed increased osteoid volume and/or 
surface in males, low stiffness and energy absorbed, and low maximum load in the lumbar vertebra of males, 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 28/130 
  
  
and decreased density in the cortical bone, of males at 30 mg/kg. In contrast, females at 30 mg/kg showed 
increased total and cortical bone density. Ostecalcin and CTx were increased at > 0.3 mg/kg in males, and at 
higher doses in females. There was a transient (early) calcium increase in both sexes at 30 mg/kg. Bone-
specific ALP was decreased in females, but increased in one male, at 30 mg/kg.  
In the 40-week study on juvenile monkeys, histopathological evaluation showed increased numbers of 
osteoclasts and increased bone resorption in the femur of a few animals treated at 3 mg/kg. One of these (a 
female) showed an increase in osteoblasts as well. pQCT evaluation showed increased total bone density and 
thickness of cortical bone in females at > 0.03 mg/kg IV, in males at > 0.3 mg/kg IV, and in both sexes at 3 
mg/kg SC. Histomorphometry revealed decreased osteoid thickness, volume and/or surface in one male at 3 
mg/kg IV, while at 3 mg/kg SC one male showed increased and another one decreased osteoid thickness. 
There were no effects on bone length or strength in juvenile monkeys. Osteocalcin and CTx were increased at 
> 0.3 mg/kg IV and at 3 mg/kg SC. Bone-specific ALP was decreased in males at > 0.3 mg/kg and in both 
sexes at 3 mg/kg IV and SC. Despite slightly lower exposure in juvenile versus adult monkeys at 3 mg/kg, 
effects on bone were more pronounced in juveniles at this dose level.  
The Applicant was asked to provide a clarifying discussion of the bone findings, with emphasis on their clinical 
relevance. In their response, the Applicant suggested that some of the differences between adult and juvenile 
animals may be due to the skeletal growth state of juveniles. This seems plausible. It is also agreed that the 
bone effects appear to be driven by excessive serum phosphate levels, causing increased bone turnover or 
formation. Based on the data presented, juvenile animals do not appear to be more sensitive to bone toxicity 
than adult animals. There was no effect on bone length or strength in juvenile monkeys. The Applicant 
proposed a text for section 5.3 which is acceptable, with a minor revision (see separate SmPC document).   
Reversibility 
Reversibility was not evaluated in rabbits. In the cynomolgus monkey 14-week study, all changes were fully 
or partially reversible except low bone-specific ALP in males, increased osteocalcin and CTx in females, and 
ectopic mineralization in the aorta at the base of the heart. In the monkey 40-week adult study, the following 
changes did not show reversibility: x-ray, gross and histopathological findings in the long bones; 
histopathological findings in the aorta, kidney, lung, heart, eye, sciatic nerve and trachea; changes in pQCT, 
and bone strength, and organ weight changes (adrenal gland, kidney) in females.  In the 40-week juvenile 
monkey study, all changes observed during the main phase were fully or partially reversible except for 
ectopic mineralization in the kidneys and eye. 
Antigenicity 
No anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in rabbits treated with burosumab up to 14 weeks.  
In the 14-week adult cynomolgus monkey study, ADA were detected in two males at 3 mg/kg from Day 28. 
In the 40 week adult monkey study, one male at 30 mg/kg showed ADA from Week 15. In all monkeys with 
ADA, serum concentrations of burosumab were diminished and increases in serum inorganic phosphate and 
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D were also attenuated. No ADA were detected in the 40-week juvenile monkey 
study. In the ePPND study in pregnant monkeys, ADA were detected in 2 dams during the lactation period, 
without any effects on exposure or serum levels of inorganic phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. 
Immunogenicity is included as an Important potential risk in the RMP, and is included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. From a non-clinical point of view, no further action is considered needed.  
Other treatment-related effects 
Decreased food consumption and body weight were observed in rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in adult monkeys at 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 29/130 
  
  
 
 
30 mg/kg. Decreased serum albumin, total protein, albumin/globulin ratio and creatinine in adult monkeys 
mainly at 30 mg/kg; and decreased serum albumin and albumin/globulin ratio in rabbits at 3 mg/kg, may 
possibly be related to malnutrition caused by decreased food consumption.  
Increased leukocytes and neutrophils in rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in adult monkeys at > 3 mg/kg, may have 
been associated with inflammation secondary to mineralization in various tissues, although in monkeys this 
was not clearly described in the pathology report. It is possible that increased PT and APTT in adult male 
monkeys at > 3 mg/kg also were related to inflammation.  
Decreased number of lymphocytes in the germinal centers of the spleen, and increased adrenal gland weight, 
in adult monkeys treated at 30 mg/kg, are most likely stress-related changes.  
Some effects on red blood cells in rabbits and monkeys were observed. Decreased haematocrit and 
haemoglobin was present in male rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in male monkeys at 30 mg/kg (14-week study). In 
the 40-week adult monkey study, decreased haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocyte count, MCV and MCH 
were observed in males at > 3 mg/kg, and in both sexes at 30 mg/kg IV and SC. Similar effects were also 
noted in dams and fetuses/offspring in the ePPND study. The mechanism behind the observed effects is 
unclear; however, the changes were of small magnitude and anaemia has not been observed in XLH patients 
treated with burosumab.   
Toxicokinetics and exposure margins 
Exposure to burosumab in monkeys increased with dose, but was not dose-proportional. There was no 
gender difference in exposure. Slight accumulation was observed in the 14-week, but not in the 40-week, 
adult monkey study. The T1/2 was 188-285 hrs on Day 85 in adult monkeys. Exposure in juvenile monkeys 
was slightly lower than in adult monkeys in the dose range 0.03-3 mg/kg.  
Plasma exposure (AUC) achieved in the repeat-dose toxicity study in adult cynomolgus monkeys exceeded 
the human therapeutic exposure by at least 24-fold. Exposure margins at the NOAELs in the two monkey 
studies were below clinical therapeutic exposure. Since the adverse effects are linked to serum phosphate 
levels and thus can be monitorable in the clinic, the lack of margins is not considered to be a crucial issue.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not appropriate for biotechnology-derived monoclonal 
antibodies such as burosumab. No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted by the 
Applicant; this is endorsed. The Applicant has submitted a carcinogenicity risk assessment document, 
summarizing and discussing relevant literature data, as well as data from in house toxicology studies. 
Published literature on humans with a genetic deficiency of FGF23, and on knockout mice, shows that the 
effects of complete antagonism of FGF23 do not raise concerns about carcinogenicity. Effects observed in 
general toxicology studies conducted in rabbits and monkeys are consistent with the pharmacology of 
burosumab. Increases in osteoclasts and osteoblasts were noted in some animals; however, these findings 
were not consistent across studies, they were graded from very slight to slight, and since serum phosphorus 
is a correlating biomarker that will be monitored in the clinic these findings are not considered to present any 
risk with regard to carcinogenicity. Overall, it is agreed that the carcinogenicity risk of burosumab appears to 
be low. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 30/130 
  
  
No dedicated studies on fertility and early embryonic development were conducted. In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies on cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse effects on female reproductive organs or changes in 
menstrual cycle were observed. Mineralization of the testes (rete testis/seminiferous tubules) was observed 
in males at 3 mg/kg, corresponding to an AUC exposure 8-fold above the clinical exposure. No changes were 
seen in semen analysis. The risk for mineralization of the testes and potential associated adverse effects on 
fertility is proposed to be handled via monitoring of serum phosphate. This is acceptable.  
Embryofetal development and prenatal/postnatal development 
The Applicant conducted an enhanced pre/post-natal development (ePPND) study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
evaluating the effects of dosing from the start of organogenesis (GD20) to late 3rd trimester. Burosumab was 
administered IV once every second week to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, from GD 20 to delivery. Six and 
4 dams in the 0 and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively, were caesarean sectioned and necropsied on GD133, 
and the fetuses were also evaluated. The remaining dams delivered offspring naturally, and the dams and 
their offspring were observed and evaluated until weaning (approximately 6 months after delivery) and PND 
360, respectively. 
Dams showed increased serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels at > 0.3 mg/kg, with 
associated ectopic mineralization in multiple tissues at > 3 mg/kg. Increased osteocalcin and CTx were 
observed at > 0.3 mg/kg. At 30 mg/kg, pQCT showed increased total bone content and density. Hematology 
showed decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCV and MCH. Ectopic mineralization was observed at 
necropsy on GD133, as well as at the end of the 6-month lactation period. Overall, findings related to 
exaggerated pharmacology of burosumab were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. 
The incidence of abortions and embryo/fetal death at 30 mg/kg was slightly increased as compared with 
vehicle-treated controls. Due to the high spontaneous background incidence of early and late pregnancy loss 
in cynomolgus monkeys, this finding was considered equivocal in relation to treatment with burosumab. 
There was a dose-related shortening of the gestation period at > 0.3 mg/kg, which was associated with a 
non-dose related increase in premature births (incidence 0%, 11.1%, 18.7% and 12.5% at control, low, mid 
and high dose, respectively). Two out of 7 premature offspring died (on PND0 and 1, respectively).  
In fetuses at 30 mg/kg, delivered by caesarean section on GD133, higher placental weight and placental 
mineralization were observed. There was no ectopic mineralization in fetal tissues; however, mineral 
substances were observed in the lung alveoli, probably due to increased inorganic phosphate level in the 
amniotic fluid. Hematology showed decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count and MCV. Serum 
inorganic phosphate was increased, and bone-specific ALP decreased. pQCT showed increased cortical bone 
density in the 30 mg/kg group. No external, visceral or skeletal abnormalities were observed. 
In naturally born offspring, the only observed effects were low haemoglobin on PND63 and increased serum 
inorganic phosphate until PND77 in the 30 mg/kg group. All other parameters (numbers of live born 
offspring, survival to PND7, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, morphological development, 
functional development, behavioral development, learning and memory tests, urinalysis, blood chemistry, 
immunological testing, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, bone marrow examination, necropsy, organ 
weight and histopathology) were normal.  
There was no difference in exposure to burosumab in pregnant versus non-pregnant females. Serum 
concentrations gradually decreased during the lactation period (non-dosing period) with half-life values of 
14.6 to 16.1 days. Burosumab was detected in serum from fetuses at all dose levels, indicating transport 
across the placenta. Serum burosumab concentration in fetuses on GD 133 (24 hours after the 9th dosing) 
was approximately 0.25-fold that in dams. The amount of burosumab transported to fetuses appeared to

increase with time, especially in the third trimester of the gestation period, which is consistent with what is 
known about placental IgG transport in cynomolgus monkeys 
Due to the presence of shorter gestation length and increased incidence of premature births at 0.3 mg/kg as 
compared with vehicle-treated controls there is no NOAEL for female reproductive toxicity in the ePPND 
study. The Applicant’s proposed NOAEL at 3 mg/kg for pre- and postnatal development in fetuses and 
offspring is agreed with. It is also agreed that burosumab did not induce teratogenicity in monkeys up to a 
dose of 30 mg/kg.  
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance was assessed within the 40-week toxicology studies. No gross or histopathological 
abnormalities were observed at the IV infusion sites or SC injection sites in adult or juvenile cynomolgus 
monkeys. In contrast, injection site reactions were commonly observed in the clinical trials with burosumab 
and are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity study of burosumab in normal cynomolgus monkey, rabbit and human tissues FITC-
conjugated burosumab was applied to cryosections at concentrations of 0.5 μg/mL or 2.5 μg/mL. FGF23 
knock-in mouse spleen (positive control) showed cytoplasmic staining of very rare cells at both 
concentrations. No specific binding was identified in any of the cryosections from rabbit, monkey or human 
tissues. Since some expression of FGF23 in normal tissues (especially the kidney) would be expected, the 
absence of staining indicates that the immunohistochemical method used was not sensitive enough to detect 
low levels of FGF23. The results of this study are not considered conclusive.  
Influences of anti-FGF23 antibody in wild-type and Hyp mice  
A murine anti-FGF23 antibody at doses of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg was administered by SC injection twice a 
week for 2 weeks, or as a single dose, to male wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J) and male hypophosphatemic 
(Hyp) mice (B6.Cg-PhexHyp/J). The Hyp mouse is considered to be a relevant animal model of human XLH. 
The results showed lower baseline serum inorganic phosphate levels in Hyp mice, and a less pronounced 
increase following anti-FGF23 treatment as compared to WT mice. There was less ectopic mineralization in 
Hyp mice as compared to WT mice at comparable dose levels, and the incidence and severity of 
mineralization were related to the level and duration of increased serum inorganic phosphate. Bone growth 
was improved in Hyp mice by the effects of anti-FGF23 antibody treatment.  
The results of this study support the Applicant’s contention that the risk of hyperphosphataemia and its 
associated sequelae of tissue mineralization is less in a hypophosphatemic disease state, such as in XLH 
patients. However, a deficiency of this study is the lack of toxicokinetic data. The results would have been 
more convincing if it could have been shown that burosumab at a similar exposure level induced less increase 
in serum phosphate, and less ectopic mineralization, in the hypophosphatemic mice as compared to wildtype 
controls. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), the environmental risk assessment for proteins may consist of a 
justification for not submitting ERA studies as they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment. As the active substance burosumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not expected to pose a risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 32/130 
  
  
to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Biacore studies showed that the KRN23/FGF23 complex could bind to Klotho. It is postulated that KRN23 
(burosumab) binds to the FGFR-binding N-terminal domain of FGF23, while the C-terminal domain binds 
Klotho. Burosumab is an IgG1 antibody which could exhibit effector functions such as antibody dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). While FGF23 is a soluble protein, 
Klotho is expressed on the cell surface and the demonstration that burosumab may bind to the complex of 
FGF23 and Klotho suggests a potential for antibody-mediated cytotoxicity to Klotho expressing cells. The 
Applicant was asked to discuss this issue. In their response, the Applicant confirmed that burosumab may 
induce ADCC activity on Klotho-expressing cells in vitro, in the presence of FGF23. This activity was shown 
with cells expressing Klotho at supraphysiological levels. Published data suggests that the highest Klotho 
expresson is seen in the kidney. In absence of any evidence for a cytotoxic activity in the kidney in non-
clinical toxicity studies or in patients, it is concluded that ADCC is unlikely to be a safety concern.  
In the 13 week GLP PD study (sbl303-116) in adult and juvenile monkeys, total and unbound FGF23 
increased after a single intravenous dose in adult and juvenile monkeys. An increase in free FGF was also 
recorded in the clinical trials with burosumab. The Applicant was asked to provide clarification of these results 
based on non-clinical data and the proposed mechanism of action. In their response, the Applicant suggested 
that the increased levels of FGF23 might be due to the dissociation of FGF23 from the burosumab/FGF23 
complex in vitro (during the assay). Alternatively, elevations in total FGF23 could also be due to an increased 
secretion of FGF23 in vivo, as a compensatory response to the elevation of serum phosphate caused by the 
inhibition of FGF23 activity following burosumab administration. In any case, the increase in total or unbound 
FGF23 does not appear to be biologically relevant or represent a cause for concern as a subsequent decrease 
in serum phosphate was not evident in monkeys or humans. 
The product is intended for treatment of patients with excess levels of FGF23. From a theoretical viewpoint, it 
would not be the goal to completely block the activity of FGF23, but rather to limit the activity to a level in 
line with physiological level and this needs to be considered in the clinical situation. Section 4.2 in the SmPC 
points out the need for monitoring and dose adjustment based on phosphate levels. The appropriateness and 
sufficiency of these measures are discussed in the clinical assessment. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The methods of analysis for toxicokinetic analysis are adequate and validation reports have been submitted. 
However, for some of the pivotal toxicology studies, the method used for toxicokinetic evaluation lacked 
formal GLP compliant validation. GLP compliance is expected for toxicokinetic data from pivotal toxicology 
studies. The method in Study AL-4116-G, which was used in all cynomolgus toxicology studies except the 14 
week repeat dose toxicity study, lacked formal GLP compliant validation. The Applicant clarified that this 
method was similar to the GLP method 6691-177 and that quality assurance was performed in compliance 
with Japanese law. There were no important differences in exposure data between the cynomolgus studies 
using the AL-4116-G method and the 6691-177 method, showing that the methods behaved in a similar way.  
It is concluded that toxicokinetics data from the cynomolgus toxicity studies are reliable and can support the 
safety evaluation.

Toxicology 
The main toxicological effect observed in the non-clinical studies was ectopic mineralization. The Applicant 
has provided an integrated assessment document concerning the risk of ectopic mineralization in patients. 
Correlation analyses show that the development of tissue mineralization in animals appears to be driven 
primarily by serum phosphate levels during treatment with burosumab. In general, supraphysiological serum 
phosphate levels exceeding 8 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) were associated with ectopic mineralization in rabbits and 
monkeys. Reversibility of mineralization was observed in some, but far from all, cases. Patients with XLH 
have serum phosphate levels < 2.8 mg/dL (normal range in humans: 3.2-6.1 mg/dL) and the target for 
treatment with burosumab is 5 mg /dL. No patient in the clinical trials had a serum phosphate level above 5 
mg/dL (see further the Clinical Assessment Report). Based on the animal data, a 40% increase above the 
target phosphate level of 5 mg/dL would be needed to cause ectopic mineralization. 
The risk of mineralization during clinical use is expected to be lower due to presence of excess FGF23 in 
patients, and manageable through monitoring and maintenance of normal phosphate and calcium levels. 
Hyperphosphataemia and ectopic mineralizaion are included as Important potential risks in the RMP. The risk 
for renal and cardiac mineralization in particular is proposed to be monitored via imaging. On the whole, the 
Applicant’s discussion and risk assessment of ectopic mineralization can be accepted.  The risk of an adverse 
reproductive outcome cannot be completely ruled out. The incidence of combined abortions/embryo-fetal 
deaths for GD20 to delivery or cesarean section on GD133 in the 30 mg/kg group was higher than the 
maximum for the control background dataset; this difference was only apparent when satellite animals were 
included. The incidence of premature births was higher at 3 mg/kg when compared to that observed in 
historical controls; this was not dose-related; the relationship to treatment is not certain. Any changes in 
bone and phosphate metabolism in the fetus are likely related to changes in maternal phosphate levels and 
subsequently, the active placental transport of phosphate to the fetus, rather than via a FGF23-related 
mechanism. 
While effects on reproductive function occurred at exposures similar to those proposed clinically, it is 
acknowledged that exposure-based safety margins are less useful for informing risk to XLH patients since the 
toxicology studies were conducted in normal animals which are overly sensitive to changes in serum 
phosphate than XLH patients and that reproductive and developmental risk is expected to be best managed 
by maintaining appropriate phosphate levels. 
The SmPC therefore advises against the use of burosumab in pregnant women and women of childbearing 
potential not using effective contraception.  However, as recommended by the CHMP, the Applicant has in 
addition identified this potential risk of an adverse reproductive outcome as part of the RMP.

Rich pharmacokinetic data are available from three of the studies in adults, and these were analysed using 
non-compartmental methods. In addition, the adult pharmacokinetic data (except data from a Phase 1 study 
in Japanese and Korean patients) were combined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Only sparse data 
are available from the paediatric studies, and the data was analysed using population pharmacokinetic 
methods.  
There is no data from healthy volunteers. 
Pharmacokinetic bioanalysis 
Serum concentrations of burosumab were determined using two different assays. An Enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin California was used to analyse study 
samples from the three adult studies included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. An 
electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay based on Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) methodology was subsequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 36/130 
  
  
 
developed at Toray Research Center and later moved to BioAgilytix Labs and revalidated. This assay was 
used to analyses samples from the study in Japanese/Korean adults and from the two paediatric studies. 
Analysis of anti-burosumab antibodies 
Immunogenicity of burosumab was evaluated in all clinical trials in the burosumab development program. 
The initial assay used to detect anti-burosumab antibodies in human serum was a sandwich ELISA, which was 
used on serum samples from subjects enrolled in the single-ascending dose study KRN23-US-02 in adult 
patients. To improve the sensitivity of the anti-burosumab antibody assay in human serum the assay was re-
developed to use the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal 
detection. This assay was used in subsequent studies. The Applicant has since filing of the MAA developed a 
new acid dissociation method with significantly higher drug tolerance, which was successfully validated. All 
available study samples will be re-tested using the new method.    
Absorption 
In the phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies with PK evaluation, subcutaneous burosumab was injected in the 
abdomen. In the Phase 2 studies in children, the injection site was rotated with each injection between the 
abdomen, upper arms, or thighs. Injection site will be rotated also in the ongoing Phase 3 studies. 
After subcutaneous administration to adults, burosumab absorption was slow with Tmax between 7 and 11 
days. Bioavailability of burosumab after subcutaneous administration was high, 90% and 128% for the 0.1 
and 0.3 mg/kg doses, respectively.  
Distribution 
After single-dose intravenous administration to adults (study KRN23-US-02), Vss for burosumab ranged 
between 44 and 57 ml/kg, indicating limited distribution. There is no in vitro data on protein binding or active 
transport, which is acceptable for an antibody. 
Elimination 
No studies have been performed to characterise the elimination mechanisms of burosumab. Its metabolism 
and elimination are expected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to 
small peptides and amino acids. 
The clearance of burosumab is low and is suggested to be dependent on body weight. After intravenous 
administration to adult patients, mean clearance ranged between 0.14 and 0.21 ml/hr/kg across dose groups 
and appeared to be independent of dose at doses of 0.003 to 0.3 mg/kg.  
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from adult and paediatric patients the point estimate of 
CL/F for a 70 kg person after subcutaneous administration was 0.29 L/Day (0.17 ml/hr/kg) (Table 2). 
The mean terminal half-life of burosumab in adults ranged from 8 to 12 days after intravenous doses and 
from 13 to 19 days after subcutaneous administration, indicating absorption-rate limited elimination at 
subcutaneous administration. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, for a typical 13 kg patient a 
half-life of around 16 days was estimated.

Linearity 
Burosumab pharmacokinetics appeared to be linear from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg according to the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis based on adult and paediatric data. Time dependency of burosumab has not been 
formally evaluated. Given that dose adjustments, as guided by pharmacodynamic response, was allowed in 
the multiple dose studies the time to reach steady state at a single dose level could not be determined. 
Based on an elimination half-life of about 19 days, time to steady state would be expected to be reached 
within 12 weeks (at dose no. 4 at Q4W dosing) if no dose adjustments were made. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Exposure data at steady state of the therapeutic dose is limited.  
There is only one study in adults with multiple dosing at the therapeutic dose, and only sparse 
pharmacokinetic data are available from this study. Also in children only sparse data are available.  
Exposure at steady state with therapeutic dosing was simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model. 
The exposure estimation in children was based on the last reported dose level and therefore reflects the 
individual dose adjustments made based on a PD endpoint. At steady state, the mean dose level was about 
11.8 mg and 39 mg in children 1-4 years and 5-12 years, respectively. The estimated mean AUCtau was 204 
µg*day/ml and 269 µg*day/ml, respectively. The numbers should be interpreted with some caution as they 
are based on sparse data and mainly C trough levels.  
There is yet no pharmacokinetic data in adolescents.  
Special populations 
There are no pharmacokinetic studies in renal or hepatic impairment.  
During development of the combined population pharmacokinetic model in adults and children an effect of 
weight on the CL/F of burosumab was assumed, and it was included already in the structural models. The 
inclusion of weight in the models was suggested to well predict the effect of body weight on the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of burosumab, justifying dosing by bodyweight.  
Gender and age were tested as co-variates but were not significant. The studied adult age range was 25-68 
years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 38/130 
  
  
 
Based on a between-study comparison, mean CL/F per kg in patients from Japan or Korea might be 
somewhat higher than in Caucasian patients. 
No in vitro or in vivo pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Serum phosphorus concentration, serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration, and TmP/GFR were increased from 
baseline after KRN23 administration in adult single dose studies. No apparent safety concerns were identified. 
The pharmacodynamics results in main clinical studies are discussed within respective study in clinical 
efficacy and safety sections of this AR. 
In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by KRN23 treatment (almost 3000-fold 
in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 and more than 800-fold in the adult study UX023-CL203); this 
unexpected finding is discussed further in detail in the safety section of this AR. 
Anti-burosumab antibodies  
Across the four clinical studies conducted in adult XLH patients, only one subject tested positive for anti-
burosumab binding antibodies, at pre-dose as well as after burosumab administration. This patient tested 
negative for anti-burosumab neutralising antibodies. Among the paediatric patients, anti-burosumab 
antibodies were detected in four patients. These patients presented with anti-burosumab antibodies only at 
baseline and the results were suggested to be within the false positive threshold for the analysis.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic evaluation of a new active substance should aim at characterising the pharmacokinetic 
properties of the substance, in order to possibly support the proposed dose regimen and to predict situations 
and patient groups where exposure may be clinically significantly different from that in the pivotal 
efficacy/safety study population. Evaluation of exposure-response and/or exposure-toxicity relationships may 
aid estimation of what is a clinically relevant difference in exposure. Burosumab is an antibody, and some 
aspects of the pharmacokinetic behaviour can therefore be predicted without specific studies. In addition, the 
dose or dose interval of burosumab will be individually adjusted based on a pharmacodynamic endpoint, 
serum phosphorous levels. The possibility to predict differences in pharmacokinetics/exposure due to intrinsic 
factors is therefore not critical.  
The ELISA and ECL assays used to determine burosumab serum levels were adequately validated.  
The drug tolerance of the original ECL assay used to detect anti-burosumab antibodies was assessed at 
rather low concentrations of drug compared to the simulated Cmax of 10.1 µg/mL in adults, at the 
therapeutic dose. This might indicate that the method is not suitable for detecting ADA in dosed patients. The 
Applicant has therefore developed a new acid dissociation method, which was adequately validated, except 
that establishment of cut-points and other characteristics was based on normal human plasma samples and 
not patient plasma. This is acceptable, given the low number of patients included in studies, however, if 
possible the Applicant is recommended to verify the cut points using patient sera. The new method improved 
the drug tolerance considerable and it is now well above the through levels of burosumab in all clinical 
studies. The applicant plans to retest all available samples from clinical studies using the new validated 
method, and to submit the results in a yearly update. Since the currently available data with the present ADA 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 39/130 
  
  
method indicate low immunogenicity of burosumab, it is considered acceptable that the results of the re-
testing of clinical samples are submitted post-approval.   
No comparison of bioavailability of burosumab between different injection sites has been performed, which is 
acceptable as the injection site will be rotated in clinical practice.  
Lack of studies to characterise the elimination mechanisms for burosumab is acceptable as it is expected to 
follow the normal immunoglobulin clearance pathways. Therefore, also lack of pharmacokinetic studies in 
renal or hepatic impairment is acceptable.  
A weight-based dosing appears justified based on the population PK analyses.  
From a strict pharmacokinetic point of view, the lack of data in adolescents and the limited data in children 1-
4 years of age is acceptable, given that the dose is individualised based on a PD parameter. In addition, 
major differences in PK in different age groups might not be expected for an antibody.   
Lack of data on pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential is acceptable. The disposition of burosumab is not 
expected to be dependent on metabolising enzymes or transport proteins. Direct effects of an antibody on 
metabolism or transport of other drugs are also not expected. In addition, burosumab is not reported to 
affect cytokine levels, and therefore secondary effects on cytokine inhibition of CYP activity are not expected. 
Adequate methodology has been used in the population PK analyses. The combined population PK/PD 
analyses in children and adults indicate that the burosumab effect on serum phosphorus levels is similar in 
both patient populations. The model is an improvement on the previous model, although there is a tendency 
for over-prediction in the heavier paediatric subjects at very high concentrations which needs to be 
considered when using the model for extrapolation.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data for burosumab is considered sufficient, and there are no outstanding issues.  
For future measurements with the new ADA assay, the CHMP recommends to verify the established cut-
points for the ADA assay in patient population-specific sera, if possible, and report any potentially significant 
impact on the immunogenicity assessment. Furthermore, it is noted that in the PK/PD model there is a 
tendency for over-prediction in the heavier paediatric subjects at very high concentrations and the CHMP 
recommends to consider this in case of the potential use of this model for extrapolation in the future.

For the paediatric population, the study UX023-CL201 in children 5-12 years is considered pivotal for this 
conditional MAA application. As the study was open-label without a placebo-control, the MAH has compared 
the results in these children with a historical cohort (study UX023-CL002). Limited efficacy information is 
available from the ongoing study UX023-CL205 in children 1-4 years at this time point. 
In addition, a confirmatory Phase 3 active controlled paediatric study (UX023-CL301; ages 1 to 12 years is 
proposed as a specific obligation for this conditional approval. Enrolment to this study UX023-CL301 has 
closed, with a total of 61 subjects enrolled (in accordance with the sample size initially planned; 
approximately 60). The last subject will complete the last visit for the Week 40 and Week 64 analyses of 
Study UX023-CL301 in Q1 and Q3 2018, respectively.

2.5.1.  Main paediatric studies 
Paediatric studies with active substance KRN23 include ongoing Phase 2 studies UX023-CL201 (ages 5 to 12 
years) and UX023-CL205 (ages 1 to 4 years).  
Study UX023-CL201:  
A Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Finding, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics and 
Safety of the anti-FGF23 Antibody, KRN23, in Paediatric Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemia 
(XLH) 
Methods 
UX023-CL201 Study Design 
planned study duration is 160 weeks (approximately 3 years). The study consisted of a 16-week individual 
dose Titration Period, followed by a 48-week Treatment Period, and a 96-week Treatment Extension Period. 
 The 
Treatments 
Subjects were enrolled sequentially into cohorts defined by the initial dose of KRN23; within each dose 
cohort, subjects were randomised to a Q2W or to a Q4W regimen. All subjects received KRN23 by SC 
injection. Initial doses were 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/kg Q2W or 0.2, 0.4 or 0.4 mg/kg Q4W, based on sequential 
enrolment and randomization; subsequent doses were adjusted every 4 weeks in 0.3 mg/kg increments, as 
needed, based on 2-week post-dose (peak) fasting serum phosphorus levels. 
Dose titration was continued for most subjects up to Week 40 and in some cases, beyond. However, mean 
KRN23 doses plateaued at approximately Week 36.  
For the Q2W group, mean KRN23 dose per administration increased from 0.24 mg/kg at Baseline to 0.73 
mg/kg at Week 16, to 0.98 mg/kg at Week 40 (N = 52), and to 0.89 mg/kg at Week 64 (N = 36). For the 
Q4W group, mean KRN23 dose per administration increased from 0.48 mg/kg at Baseline to 1.15 mg/kg at 
Week 16 and to 1.50 mg/kg at Week 40; mean KRN23 dose per administration decreased to 0.94 mg/kg at 
Week 64 due to the change in regimen from Q4W to Q2W at the beginning of the Treatment Extension 
Period.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• Change from Baseline in severity of rickets as measured by Rickets Severity Score (RSS) total score: 
Radiographs were obtained during the study to for the assessment of rickets and other bone abnormalities. 
Bilateral anteroposterior (AP) knee radiographs and bilateral posteroanterior (PA) hand/wrist radiographs 
were obtained at Screening Visit 1 and at the Weeks 40 and 64 study visits. Standing long leg radiographs 
were obtained at Screening Visit 1 and at the Week 64 study visit. 
The severity of rickets was measured using a modified version of a scale developed by Thomas Thacher, MD 
(Thacher et al. 2000). The RSS system is a radiographic scoring method developed to assess the severity of 
nutritional rickets in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal fraying, concavity, and the 
proportion of the growth plate affected. RSS was scored using a predefined methodology (Biomedical 
Systems Independent Review Manual, September 2014); each radiograph was scored individually without the 
need to reference back to a screening image for comparison, which allows the rater to remain blinded to 
radiograph sequence and treatment status. The method has been shown to have good intra- and inter-rater 
reliability (correlations of 0.89 and 0.84, respectively) (Thacher et al. 2000). RSS scores for XLH patients are, 
however, lower than those observed in nutritional rickets due to differences in the radiographic appearance of 
rickets between the two diseases that are impacted by the scoring methodology.  
RSS scores range from 0 to 4 for the wrist and 0 to 6 for the knee, with higher scores associated with greater 
rickets severity. These scores are summed to generate an RSS total score and in XLH typically does not 
exceed 4.0. 
Thomas Thacher, MD, the developer of the RSS methodology, served as the single, central, independent 
rater and performed all RSS scoring for this study, as well as for Study UX023-CL002. After day 120 LoQ, the 
radiographs have been assessed by two additional rates. As may be expected, intra-rater agreement returns 
‘better’ agreement than inter-rater agreement. 
Some of the intra-and inter-rater reliability assessments analysis show only minimal or weak agreement. The 
Applicant is requested to calculate main efficacy results from the ratings of the two additional readers 
separately, in order to see if the overall results remain if ratings from these two readers are used (LoQ).  
 Dr Thacher was contracted by the central imaging facility with no direct relationship to Ultragenyx. Each 
radiograph was scored individually by Dr Thacher, who was blinded to the study visit at which the 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 44/130 
  
  
radiographs were taken and the subject’s dose, dose regimen, adherence to the study protocol, duration of 
treatment, and prior conventional therapy. 
As a means to further reduce potential bias, additional radiographs were included in the batches reviewed. A 
validation effort utilizing the data from the UX023-CL002 study to confirm the applicability of the RSS and 
RGI-C (see below) scoring systems for use in XLH has been submitted by the Applicant.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Change from Baseline in severity of rickets as measured by RSS knee and wrist scores 
• Change from Baseline in the radiographic appearance of rickets and bowing as measured by Radiographic 
Global Impression of Change (RGI-C) global, knee, wrist and long leg scores: 
In contrast to the RSS, where a severity score is assigned based on individual wrist and knee radiographs 
from a single time point, the RGI-C methodology allows for the evaluation of change in the radiographic 
appearance of rickets by doing a side-by-side comparison of an earlier image and an image taken at a later 
time point, a technique that simulates clinical practice. 
Three paediatric radiologists not affiliated with the conduct of the study or Ultragenyx and contracted by 
Biomedical Systems, Inc. performed blinded independent RGI-C ratings for the wrist, knee, and long leg 
radiographs. Radiograph pairs were presented for review in random order. 
The rater is asked to indicate the presence or absence of a series of XLH-related abnormalities such as 
metaphyseal lucency, metaphyseal/epiphyseal separation, metaphyseal fraying, and metaphyseal concave 
cupping, which are essentially the same radiographic features evaluated in the RSS. Once the presence or 
absence of these abnormalities has been recorded, the rater is asked to integrate the information and rate 
changes in these abnormalities based on the appearance of Image B relative to Image A using the following 
7-point ordinal RGI-C scale. 
The RGI-C global score is an overall score based on the general impression of change in the wrist and knee 
images – it is not calculated based on the RGI-C wrist and knee scores that have already been assigned. The 
rater also assigns an RGI-C leg score based on the standing long leg radiographs. Changes in lower extremity 
deformities were assessed at Week 64 as part of the RGI‑ C evaluation. For each RGI-C score (wrist, knee, 
global and leg), the average of the scores assigned by the three independent raters were used for analysis. 
As a means to further reduce potential bias, additional radiographs were included in the batches reviewed. 
RSS measures the rickets severity in single radiographs. In contrast, RGI-C measures the change in paired 
radiographs. RGI-C assessment could therefore overestimate healing effect in a study, where all patients 
received active treatment. It is much preferred for the RSS tool to be the main analysis tool for x-rays in the 
current development programme. The RGI-C tool is considered to be supportive only. 
• Growth (standing height, sitting height, arm length, and leg length) 
To assess growth during KRN23 treatment, standing height, sitting height, arm length, and leg length were 
measured by a physical therapist at Weeks 16, 24, 40, and 64. Growth velocity was calculated as the change 
in growth between intervals on an annualized basis and z-factors calculated for an additional age and gender 
adjusted analysis of growth rate. 
• Walking Ability (Six-minute Walk Test [6MWT]) 
The 6MWT was administered by a trained clinician in accordance with general principles set forth in the 
American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS 2002) 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 45/130 
  
  
• Functional disability and pain (Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America – Pediatric Outcomes Data 
Collection Instrument [POSNA-PODCI]) 
The POSNA-PODCI was developed to measure the functional health of paediatric and adolescent patients with 
a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. The questionnaire yields a global function score, a happiness score, 
and four functional assessment scores (upper extremity functioning, transfers and basic mobility, sports and 
physical functioning, and comfort/pain). Raw, mean, standardized, and normative scores were calculated for 
each scale. The global function score is an average of the four functional scores. Standardized scores range 
from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the poorest outcome or worst health and 100 the best possible outcome 
or best health. Normative scores were calculated so that higher scores indicate better functioning. All scores 
were referenced to the general, healthy population with a normative mean score of 50 and a standard 
deviation of 10.  
General Safety Endpoints 
• All adverse events 
• Events to monitor: Injection site reaction (High-Level Term), Hypersensitivity, Hyperphosphataemia, 
Ectopic mineralization, Gastrointestinal events, Restless legs syndrome 
• Chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters: Serum 25(OH)D, FGF23 (total), GFR 
• Human anti-human antibody (HAHA) 
• Vital signs Physical exams, Pregnancy tests, Concomitant medications 
Ectopic Mineralization Endpoints 
• Renal ultrasound, ECG, ECHO, Serum calcium, Urinary calcium excretion rate, Serum iPTH, Serum 
creatinine 
Study Key PD Measures 
• Serum phosphorus, Serum 1,25(OH)2D, TmP/GFR 
Renal phosphate reabsorption is impaired in patients with XLH due to excess FGF23. TmP/GFR is a measure 
of renal phosphate reabsorption, the primary mechanism by which FGF23 regulates phosphate homeostasis 
by comparing the fractional absorption of phosphate relative to the estimated rate of glomerular filtration, 
which provides insight into the degree to which phosphate is being reabsorbed relative to the amount of 
glomerular filtrate. 
Secondary PD measures 
• Urinary phosphorus, TRP, Fractional Excretion of Phosphorus (FEP), Bone Biomarkers (P1NP, CTx, ALP, 
BALP) 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint 
• Serum pre-dose concentrations of KRN23 Efficacy Endpoints 
Randomisation 
Within each initial dose cohort, subjects were randomised 1:1 to the Q2W or to the Q4W regimen via an 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) based on a randomisation schedule developed by an independent

third-party vendor. Randomisation was initially stratified by gender but not after the implementation of 
amendment 3 when the study was expanded to include additional subjects with RSS of at least 1.5 at the 
knee. 
Statistical methods 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, Change from Baseline in severity of rickets as measured by RSS total 
score, the null hypothesis of no change from Baseline of RSS total score was tested using a one sample t 
test. A supportive analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with change of 
RSS total score from baseline as dependent variable, baseline RSS total score as covariate and regimen 
group as categorical independent variable at Week 40. 
The change from Baseline of RSS total score was summarized by each regimen descriptively. The difference 
between the two regimens (Q2W and Q4W) was summarized with 95% CI. No formal hypothesis was tested. 
The RGI-C (global, knee, wrist and long leg) scores were summarized by each regimen using descriptive 
statistics. The difference between the two regimens (Q2W and Q4W) was summarized by descriptive 
statistics with 95% CI No formal hypothesis was tested. 
For efficacy analyses, subgroups of subjects were defined based on severity of rachitic disease. The “higher 
RSS” subgroup consisted of subjects with total RSS scores at baseline ≥ 1.5; the “lower RSS” subgroup 
consisted of subjects with total RSS scores at baseline < 1.5. This RSS total score cutoff was chosen based 
on the median RSS total score of the study population at the interim analysis of first 12 subjects. Subgroup 
analysis by gender were also performed.  
For analysis of 6MWT results, subgroups also were defined based on the Baseline percentage of predicted 
6MWT (< 80% [abnormal] or ≥ 80% [normal]). For analysis of POSNA-PODCI questionnaire results, 
subgroups also were defined based on the Baseline global functioning scale (< 40 or ≥ 40).  
In addition, radiographs from KRN23-treated subjects could also be compared to historical controls at the 
Week 40 analysis and the Week 64 final analysis depending on the availability of data from a comparable 
group of subjects. 
Analyses of long-term efficacy will be conducted during and at the completion of the Treatment Extension 
Period (Weeks 64-160).  
Recruitment 
This study is being conducted at a total of 9 centres: 4 in the United States, 3 in the United Kingdom, one in 
France, and one in the Netherlands. 
A total of 79 paediatric subjects were screened and 52 paediatric subjects were enrolled into the study, of 
which 36 subjects in the US and 16 in Europe. 
Of those 27 subjects who were screen failures, 18 patients did not have radiographic evidence of active bone 
disease; 4 were Tanner stage > 2; 3 did not have biochemical findings associated with XLH (including two 
patients who did not have radiographic evidence of active bone disease); and one did not have confirmation 
of XLH supported by PHEX mutation or elevated serum FGF23. In addition, 3 patients had nephrocalcinosis 
grade ≥ 3 by renal ultrasound.

Study Period: 02 July 2014 (first subject consent and Screening Visit 1) to data cut-off 01 December 2016 
(at least 64 weeks of KRN23 treatment for all subjects) 
The study is ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
The original version of Protocol UX023-CL201 was dated 24 February 2014 and was amended five times. 
Several of the amendments had an impact on study conduct and a number of the changes made were based 
on evolving data and/or experience: 
Within Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 02 March 2015) cohort 3 was expanded to include up to 30 subjects for 
a total study population of up to 50 subjects, a Rickets Severity Score (RSS) at the knee of at least 1.5, as 
determined by a central reader, was required for inclusion in the expansion group and because the 
enrollment criteria were adjusted to require a specific level of rickets severity, gender-related differences in 
the severity of skeletal disease were minimized and the requirement for gender balance was removed for the 
expansion group. To indicate that changes in rickets severity was to be evaluated by two methods; the RSS 
method was added to the Radiograph Global Impression of Change (RGI-C) system and details about blinding 
of radiographic assessments were added. 
With protocol Amendment 4 (dated 22 April 2015) target serum phosphorus range was changed to 5.0 mg/dL 
from 4.5 mg/dL, the dose titration scheme was updated. The maximum dose of KRN23 was updated to allow 
the group of subjects in regimen Q2 to increase the dose up to 2.0 mg/kg Q2 if needed and to add that in 
both the Q2 and Q4 groups the maximum allowable dose is 90 mg. 
This change was based on the finding that some subjects needed doses higher than 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L) 
to achieve the serum phosphorus target, regardless of whether the dose was given at the Q2W or Q4W dose 
regimen. Approximately half of the subjects in the Q4W regimen were already receiving doses above 1.0 
mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L) to achieve the proposed target serum phosphorus range, and no safety concerns were 
raised. 
Protocol Amendment 5 (dated 28 August 2015) incorporated a 96-week Treatment Extension Period into the 
study design to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of KRN23. During the Treatment Extension Period, 
all subjects receive Q2W administration of KRN23. 
The transition of subjects to Q2W dosing reflected interim Week 40 findings related to serum phosphorus 
levels, rickets, and dose. Subjects in the Q2W dosing regimen showed a more stable and consistent increase 
in serum phosphorus levels with less fluctuation over time than in subjects who received KRN23 Q4W for 
whom serum phosphorus levels increased at the middle of the dose cycle (week 2) but tended to return to 
baseline at the end of the dose interval (week 4).  
Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 07 July 2016) was implemented after the data cut-off date of 16 June 2016 to 
clarify language and procedures regarding dose adjustment, to add an option for non-healthcare provider 
administration of study drug under certain conditions; to add reflexive genetic testing to assess additional 
genes associated with phenotypes overlapping with XLH if initial PHEX mutation analysis is negative or 
inconclusive; and to clarify or update study procedures and assessments.

Most subjects (34/52 [65.4%]) had family members with XLH, most frequently the mother, and most were 
positive for pathogenic mutations in the PHEX gene (45/52 [86.5%]). 
Mean walking distance at Baseline was 483 m overall, corresponding to a predicted 6MWT distance (based on 
age, gender, and height) of 80.4% of normal (77.4% for the higher RSS subgroup vs 86.0% for the lower 
RSS subgroup). At Baseline, mean scores for the POSNA-PODCI Sports/Physical Functioning scale was 33.4 
and for the Pain/Comfort scale was 35.0. (The normative healthy population mean is 50, 10 points = 1 SD, 
and a score of 40 is the lower limit of the normal range).  
Numbers analysed

Table 9: Change in RSS Scores to Weeks 40 and 64 by Dose Regimen (ITT Analysis Set, Lower RSS 
Subgroup, N = 18) 
Greater improvements in RSS scores were observed in subjects with greater disease severity at Baseline. In 
subjects with low RSS scores at Baseline and little room for improvement by this measure, the low level of 
rachitic disease remained low to Week 64 of the study. This result demonstrates that KRN23 efficacy was 
greater in patients with more severe disease as compared with those with less severe disease. 
RSS data were analyzed using the prespecified responder definition (ie, reduction in RSS total score from 
Baseline of at least 1.0 points). Overall, 66.7% of subjects were RSS responders at Week 64 (Q2W: 70.0%, 
Q4W: 63.2%). All subjects in the higher RSS subgroup had Baseline RSS total score ≥  1.0 and were included 
in the responder analysis.

KRN23 treatment resulted in healing of rickets, as assessed by RGI-C, in both the higher (N = 34) and lower 
(N = 18) RSS subgroups.  
In the higher RSS subgroup, mean global, wrist, and knee RGI-C scores at Weeks 40 and 64 were > +1.7 in 
the overall group and in both treatment regimens (p < 0.0001 [GEE model]). Mean (SD) values at Weeks 40 
and 64 were +1.91 (0.379) and +1.98 (0.402), respectively, for global scores; +1.91 (0.744) and +2.09 
(0.749), respectively, for wrist scores; and +1.80 (0.419) and +1.93 (0.365), respectively, for knee scores. 
In the lower RSS subgroup, mean global, wrist, and knee RGI-C scores at Weeks 40 and 64 were positive in 
the overall group and in both treatment regimens (> +0.67; p < 0.05 [GEE model]). Mean (SD) values at 
Weeks 40 and 64 were +0.91 (0.846) and +0.80 (0.733), respectively, for global scores; +0.85 (0.818) and

Changes in Standing Height 
Three measures of change in standing height velocity, Z score, and percentile for age and gender were 
performed. 
KRN23 treatment for 64 weeks increased growth velocity. Overall, mean (SD) growth velocity increased, 
from 5.35 (1.280) cm/year at Baseline (i.e, the 2 years before study entry) to 5.91 (1.354) cm/year (+10%, 
p = 0.0376, one sample t-test). Mean (SD) standing height Z score increased from -1.89 (0.996) at Baseline 
to -1.73 (1.002) at Week 64, an LS mean (SE) change of +0.15 (0.039) (p < 0.0001). 
Mean (SD) percentile standing heights were 8.67 (11.516) at Baseline and 10.71 (14.060) at Week 64.

A borderline significant increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year (p=0.0e) as well as 
improvement in age/gender adjusted standing height Z score +0.15 (p<0.0001).  
The numbers for change in height variables indicated better outcomes in Q2 group. However, it is noted that 
baseline z-score and standing height percentiles were lower at baseline in Q4W group. 
Growth is a complex issue to investigate and a large individual variation has been observed. Therefore, 
results from the confirmatory phase 3 study are awaited before including claims on growth in the SmPC 
section 5.1. 
The mean weight increase was apparently higher in the q2w regimen (4.9kg) vs. Q4w regimen (3.6kg) which 
seems reasonable as q2w regimen group also had a tendency to faster growth. Mean weight z-scores were 
nearly unchanged. However, some subjects had a disproportionate weight increase, an issue to be followed in 
the randomised study. 
Walking Ability by 6MWT at Week 40 
The 6MWT distance provides an indicator of mobility and physical functioning, though it alone does not assess 
the type of gait observed.

The mean improvement in 6MWT was +47 m overall (p<0.0001) and +77 m in those with <80% predicted at 
baseline (p<0.0001). The numbers indicate better outcomes in Q2 group. 
Interpretation of results from results 6MWT in an open-label study design where all subjects received active 
treatment is challenging. Data from the confirmatory phase 3 study are awaited before including claims on 
6MWT in the SmPC section 5.1.

Improvement on POSNA/PODCI score in Sports/Physical Functioning was 33% to 42% and Pain/Comfort 35 
to 42% (p=0.0002). However, the magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in 
paediatric patients with the current study design. Therefore, no claims on these variables in the SmPC 5.1 
are endorsed at this time point.

KRN23 treatment increased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels in both the Q2W and Q4W groups, and 1,25(OH)2D 
levels increased from Baseline to Week 64 in the overall study population by 78% (41.3 to 59.6 pg/mL 
[107.5 to 154.9 pmol/L]). Increases in 1,25(OH)2D from Baseline were statistically significant at each study

by Regimen (PK/PD Analysis Set) 
Biomarkers of Bone Turnover 
P1NP, a marker of bone formation, and CTx, a marker of bone resorption, increased during the study. Mean 
(SD) serum P1NP concentrations increased from 791 (216) ng/mL at Baseline, to 1033 (282) ng/mL at Week 
40 (mean change: +37.1%), to 931 (312) ng/mL at Week 64 (mean change: +20.0%). Mean (SD) serum 
CTx concentrations increased from 2.16 (0.658) ng/mL at Baseline, to 2.98 (0.851) ng/mL at Week 40 (mean 
change: +43.1%), to 3.09 (0.937) ng/mL at Week 64 (mean change: +49.6%).  
Constant increases in CTx and PiNP were seen from baseline. This could be supportive for a biological effect 
of the drug on bone metabolism, as increase in bone turnover is usually seen as osteomalacia improves. 
However, the magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients as 
biological variation with age has not been established for this group of subjects.  
Biomarkers of Rickets – ALP and BALP 
Total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases are elevated in the presence of rickets, and the magnitude of 
elevation correlates with the magnitude of rickets (Carpenter et al. 2011). 
These parameters are commonly used as biomarker for the presence and severity of rickets and is one of the 
primary methods used by physicians managing conventional therapy of XLH as a tool to assess results, since 
repeated X-rays are not advisable for children.

Mean (SD) serum ALP levels decreased to 395 (95) U/L at Week 40 (mean change: -12.6%, p < 0.0001) and 
to 369 (76) U/L at Week 64 (-19.8%, p < 0.0001); decreases were similar in the two dose groups. Mean 
(SD) serum BALP levels decreased to 134 (38) μg/L at Week 40 (mean change: -16.9%) and to 115 (31) 
μg/L at Week 64 (mean change: -28.5%) (Table 14.2.3.5), and decreases were similar in the two dose 
groups.

Effects were also greater in children with baseline RSS Total Score >=1.5.  
This could be supportive for an effect of the drug on healing of rickets. However, the magnitude of effect and 
clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients as biological variation with age has not been 
established for this group of subjects.

Study UX023-CL205:  
Multicentre, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old with XLH who are naïve to therapy or 
have previously received conventional therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D to assess the safety, 
PD, PK, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a 
total of 64 weeks. The current analysis includes data from 13 subjects through Week 40. 
Subjects who complete the study may continue into an extension study. This study is being conducted at 
three centers in the United States. 
Methods 
Number of Subjects Planned and Analyzed:  
Approximately 10 paediatric subjects were planned for enrollment and 13 subjects were enrolled.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility:  
Subjects were between 1 and 4 years old, inclusive, with clinical findings consistent with XLH, including 
hypophosphataemia and radiographic evidence of rickets (at least 5 subjects were required to have a Rickets 
Severity Score [RSS] at the knee of ≥ 1.5 points at Screening), and a confirmed PHEX mutation or variant of 
uncertain significance. To maintain a level of gender balance, no more than 7 subjects of either gender were 
enrolled. Subjects unwilling to stop treatment with any oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D therapy 
during screening and for the duration of the study were excluded. 
Dose  
Subjects received KRN23 at a starting total dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at 
any time if a subject meets the following dose adjustment criteria: 1) two consecutive serum phosphorus 
measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum phosphorus has increased by < 0.5 mg/dL from 
baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of study drug that would account for the decrease in 
serum phosphorus. 
Endpoints 
Safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic endpoints were approximately similar than in the 
study Study UX023-CL201.  
Results 
Subject Disposition:  
A total of 13 paediatric subjects were enrolled into the study; enrollment is closed. All 13 subjects were 
included in each analysis set (Efficacy Analysis Set, PK/PD Analysis Set, and Safety Analysis Set). As of the 
data cutoff date (20 April 2017), all subjects completed Week 40, no subject had discontinued from 
treatment or from the study, and all subjects continue in the study. Additionally, 9, 7, and 4 subjects have 
received burosumab through Weeks 42, 44, and 46, respectively, as of the data cutoff date.

Total enrollment was 9 boys (69.2%) and 4 girls (30.8%). Although the study aimed to maintain gender 
balance by enrolling no more than 7 subjects of either gender, based on a target enrollment of approximately 
10 subjects, enrollment of 9 boys among 13 total subjects maintained the 70% single gender ratio sought. 
One patient was screened for the study and was not enrolled (Subject 138-507) because they did not meet 
the entry criteria for biochemical findings associated with XLH (serum phosphorus and creatinine levels)  
Baseline Demographics and Medical History:  
Per the enrollment criteria, all subjects in this study were paediatric, with ages ranging from 1 to 4 years 
(mean [SD]: 2.9 [1.15] years); 9 boys (69.2%) and 4 girls (30.8%) were enrolled and the majority of 
subjects were white (12/13 [92.3%]) and Not Hispanic or Latino (11/13 [84.6%]). Subjects’ growth was 
impaired: mean (SD) recumbent length/standing height of 89.15 (7.597) cm and a percentile for age and 
gender of 18.0% (25.26%) with a mean (SD) Z score of -1.38 (1.195). Mean (SD) weight was 12.92 (1.816) 
kg with a mean (SD) Z score of -0.97 (1.157). 
Most subjects (11/13 [84.6%]) were positive for known pathogenic mutations in the PHEX gene. One subject 
had a variant in the PHEX gene considered likely pathogenic, and one subject had a VUS. Overall each of 
these findings is likely consistent with the genetic diagnosis of XLH, in the setting of the overall clinical 
picture. 
Pharmacodynamic Parameters at Baseline 
Key PD parameters showed abnormalities expected for subjects with XLH. Baseline mean (SD) serum 
phosphorus concentrations were 2.51 (0.284) mg/dL (0.81 [0.092] mmol/L), below the lower limit of the 
reference range for paediatric patients (3.2 mg/dL [1.03 mmol/L]). Mean serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations 
were 44.83 (17.621) pg/mL (116.6 [45.81] pmol/L). Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 11/13 (84.6%) 
children, with a mean (SD) of 548.5 (193.80) U/L. 
Prior Treatment History: All subjects (100%) had received previous XLH treatment with conventional 
therapy (oral phosphate and/or vitamin D).  The mean (SD) duration of conventional therapy before entering 
the study was 16.9 (13.90) months, with mean (SD) age at initiation of 19.1 (18.49) months. 
Rickets Severity at Baseline: 
RSS scores from radiographs taken at Screening prior to the initiation of KRN23 treatment and used as 
baseline results showed the presence of rickets (RSS score > 0) in all subjects at both the knee and the 
wrists. Mean (SD) RSS baseline scores were 2.92 (1.367) overall, 1.65 (0.801) at the knee, and 1.27 (0.696) 
at the wrist. The higher prevalence of rickets in the knees is likely due to faster growth and larger bones at 
the distal femur and proximal tibia/fibula compared with the wrist. 
Extent of Exposure: 
As of the data cutoff date, all 13 subjects received at least 21 doses (Week 40) of burosumab. Two subjects 
received 22 doses (Week 42), 3 subjects received 23 doses (Week 44), and 4 subjects received 24 doses 
(Week 46). 
All subjects received all planned doses of burosumab at a prescribed dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W through Week 
20. Ten subjects continued to receive burosumab at 0.8 mg/kg Q2W through the data cutoff date (at least

Week 40). Three subjects had dose increases to 1.2 mg/kg Q2W based on the protocol-specified dose 
adjustment criteria; dose was increased at Week 22 for 2 subjects and at Week 34 for one subject. For all 3 
subjects with dose increases, burosumab dose was continued at the increased dose (1.2 mg/kg Q2W) 
through the data cutoff date. 
The mean total dose per administration ranged from 10.2 to 13.0 mg through Week 40. 
Pharmacodynamic Results: 
Serum Phosphorus 
The primary efficacy endpoint is this study is the change from baseline over time in serum phosphorus.  
At Baseline, all subjects had serum phosphorus levels below normal, with a mean (SD) of 2.51 (0.284) 
mg/dL (0.81 [0.092] mmol/L) compared with the normal range of 3.2 to 6.1 mg/dL (1.03 to 1.97 mmol/L). 
Burosumab treatment rapidly and substantially increased mean serum phosphorus levels with mean 
concentrations above the lower limit of normal (LLN) at all post-Baseline time points. Increases in serum 
phosphorus concentration from Baseline were statistically significant at each study visit (p < 0.0001, GEE 
analysis). At Week 40, mean (SD).

Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) 
Elevated circulating levels of FGF23, distinctive of XLH, impair normal phosphate reabsorption in the kidney 
and suppress 1,25(OH)2D. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D in children with XLH are generally within normal levels but 
are low for the degree of hypophosphataemia associated with XLH. 
Burosumab treatment increased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels from 44.8 (17.62) pg/mL (116.6 [45.81] pmol/L) 
at Baseline to 56.8 (10.34) pg/mL (136.2 [24.83] pmol/L) at Week 40 (mean change: +43%). Increases in 
1,25(OH)2D from Baseline were statistically significant at each study visit through Week 40 (p < 0.01, GEE 
analysis). In previous studies in adults with XLH, maximum increases from baseline in serum 1,25(OH)2D 
levels were observed at approximately 1 week after the first KRN23 dose. Therefore, this pattern of increase 
in serum 1,25(OH)2D with a maximum value at Week 1 is consistent with previous findings. 
No hypercalcaemia was observed in response to the increase in serum 1,25(OH)2D. 
The assay method for serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations changed  during the study. The change in assay 
methodology was therefore considered to result in an underestimation in the increase of mean serum 
1,25(OH)2D concentration at Week 20. 
Serum ALP: Biomarker of Rickets 
Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in the presence of rickets, and the magnitude of elevation 
correlates with the magnitude of rickets (Carpenter et al. 2011). For this reason, ALP is commonly used as a 
biomarker for the presence and severity of rickets. ALP is also one of the primary methods used by 
physicians managing conventional therapy of XLH because repeated x-rays are not advisable for children. At 
baseline, mean (SD) serum ALP levels were 549 (193.8) U/L, well above the upper limit of the normal (ULN) 
ranges for the children in this study (approximately 297 to 345 U/L, depending on the age and sex of the 
child).  
A decrease in mean serum ALP levels was observed at the first post-baseline assessment: at Week 4, mean 
(SD) levels were 468 (136.6) U/L (mean change: -12.5%). Change from Baseline to Week 4 was statistically 
significant (p = 0.0003, GEE model). 
Mean (SD) serum ALP levels decreased further to 389 (84.2) U/L at Week 20 (mean change: -24.8%) and to 
335 (87.6) U/L at Week 40 (mean change: -36.3%). Changes from Baseline to Weeks 20 and 40 were 
statistically significant (p < 0.0001). 
Eleven subjects (85%) had serum ALP concentrations above the ULN for age and sex at Baseline; all subjects 
had decreases from Baseline to Week 40. Three subjects (23%) had decreases from above the ULN for age 
and sex at Baseline to within the reference range at Week 40  
One subject had a serum ALP concentration of 908 U/L at Week 12. The subject had no concurrent TEAEs or 
laboratory values that would be associated with or could explain this highly elevated value. This outlier value 
reported is presumed to be spurious.

Efficacy Results 
All 13 subjects had substantial healing of rickets (RGI-C global score ≥ +2.0) at Week 40. Eleven of the 13 
subjects had decreases in RSS total score from Baseline to Week 40, indicating reduced severity of rickets. 
The 2 subjects with no change in RSS total score had substantial healing of rickets by RGI-C global score and 
decreases in serum ALP; one of these subjects also had substantial healing of lower limb deformities by RGI-
C. Improvement was noted in most subjects in specific abnormalities observed in knee and wrist radiographs 
and in standing long leg radiographs. RGI-C assessment of lower limb deformities showed improvement from 
Baseline to Week 40 in all subjects; 2 subjects showed substantial improvement of lower limb deformities.  
Growth 
Mean (SD) recumbent length/standing height increased from 89 (7.6) cm at Baseline to 93 (7.0) cm at Week 
40. All subjects had increases in recumbent length/standing height from Baseline to Week 40; median 
change from Baseline was 4.10 cm with a range of 0.1 to 9.4 cm. Mean (SD) recumbent length/standing 
height as a percentile for age and gender was 18.0% (25.3%) at Baseline and 12.8% (18.9%) at Week 40; 
the mean change was -5.3 (20.2) percentile points. Median (range) recumbent length/standing height as a 
percentile for age and gender was 8.5% (0.0% to 83.3%) at Baseline and 5.4% (0.0% to 62.1%) at Week 
40; the median change was -0.3 (-70.4 to 9.8) percentile points. The large difference between the mean and 
median values in this measure is due to the wide range of percentile values (eg, 0.01% to 83% at Baseline) 
and the susceptibility of means to extreme values. 
Mean (SD) recumbent length/standing height Z score was -1.4 (1.19) at Baseline and -1.7 (1.12) at Week 
40, a change of -0.3 (0.66). Median (range) recumbent length/standing height Z score was -1.4 (-3.66 to 
0.97) at Baseline and -1.6 (-4.03 to 0.31) at Week 40, a median change of -0.2 (-2.10 to 0.29). The change 
in Z score was not statistically significant (LS mean [SE]: -0.20 [0.134], p = 0.1396, GEE model). Results of 
sensitivity analyses using the 1-sample t test and the Wilcoxon 1-sample signed rank test were consistent 
with the GEE model with respect to statistical significance. 
Recumbent length/standing height, expressed both as a percentile for age and gender and as Z scores, 
tended to decrease; the change in Z score from Baseline to Week 40 was not statistically significant. These 
assessments with a small study sample size and a relatively short exposure showed considerable variability 
(SDs larger than the means). No conclusions can be drawn regarding changes in growth due to burosumab 
from this study. 
Summary and conclusions Study UX023-CL205 
The pharmacodynamics results indicate similar response than seen in children 5-12 years.  
The Applicant has presented results for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in study UX023-CL002 
stratified for subgroups age 5-8 years and age 9-12 years. The proportion of subjects considered responders 
with an RGI-C global score ≥ +2.0, i.e. substantial improvement, at Week 64 was 60.9% in the 5 to < 9 year 
old subgroup and 48.3% in the 9 to 12 year old subgroup.  
The CHMP considers that clinical efficacy results from age group 5-12 years can be extrapolated to ages 1 to 
4 years old. Final results of Study UX023-CL205 will be submitted in line with the due date setup in the

specific obligation. In this study, length/standing height, expressed both as a percentile for age and gender 
and as Z scores, tended to decrease instead of expected increase. No claims on growth are included in the 
current SmPC for any age group. The final study results at 64 weeks will be submitted in line with the due 
date setup in the specific obligation. 
2.5.2.  Supportive paediatric studies  
Study UX023-CL002: 
A Retrospective Longitudinal Study of Skeletal Outcomes in Children with X-linked 
Hypophosphataemia (conventional therapy) 
Methods 
This retrospective study is currently ongoing, and the currently submitted report describes data obtained 
from radiographic and medical records of 52 subjects, 35 of whom have evaluable paired radiographs of the 
wrists and knees at Shriners Hospital for Children in St. Louis, Missouri, up through the data cutoff date (09 
August 2016).  
For radiographic analyses of rickets and lower extremity deformities, subjects were required to have a 
minimum of two sets of wrist, knee, and/or long leg images taken 1 to 2 years apart (± 3 months) when the 
subject was between 5 and 14 years of age. The 1 to 2 years’ span was prespecified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) and was intended to match approximately the duration of 40 to 64 weeks in Study UX023-CL201 
to provide a reference to evaluate the treatment effects of KRN23.  
Data extracted from the medical records of consenting subjects included demographics, family history, 
diagnostic history, history of treatment with conventional therapy including dose, regimen and complications, 
co-morbid conditions affecting bone health or XLH management, growth history and historical biochemical 
markers of phosphate metabolism, including serum or plasma levels of phosphorus, calcium, intact 
parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). 
Laboratory collection dates were matched as closely as possible to the date the radiographic imaging to verify 
the biochemical profile of the subject at the time. 
Results from this study will be used to put the treatment response observed in subjects treated with KRN23, 
into the context of the disease and the existing treatment (i.e., conventional therapy with oral phosphate and 
active vitamin D). 
Endpoints: 
  XLH Treatment History 
  Severity of rickets as measured by RSS (RSS wrist, knee and total scores),  
  Change in severity of rickets and bowing as measured by RGI-C (RGI-C global, knee, wrist and long 
leg scores)  
  RGI-C responder,  
  XLH Biochemical Parameters:  (phosphorus calcium, 1,25(OH)2D, iPTH and ALP) and  
  Standing height (cm, Z score, percentile).

Sample size 
Initially the targeted sample size was up to 200 children. The sample size was revised within study protocol 
amendment 1 (dated 25 September 2015) due to the reduction in the scope of the study from subjects 1 to 
17 years of age to subjects 5 to 14 years of age. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. This is a retrospective non-interventional study intended to provide a reference to evaluate 
the treatment effects of KRN23 in Study UX023-CL201. 
The use of an external reference group is endorsed although a concurrent randomised comparator is 
preferred.  Age and time span (“follow-up”) have been considered to match the study population in study 
UX023-CL201. There was no gender restriction analogous the restriction regarding gender in study UX023-
CL201 (in the pre-expansion group, no more than 20 patients of either sex should be enrolled) having 
acknowledged that of more importance in study UX023-CL201 given the limited sample size.  In comparing 
the two studies there was a gender difference (approximately 50%/50% in Study UX023-CL201 versus 
approximately 30%/70% boys/girls in Study UX023-CL002). 
Statistical methods 
De-identified x-rays were processed for rating by the central imaging facility, the same central imaging 
facility used for x-ray processing in Study UX023-CL201. The full analysis set consisted of all enrolled 
subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and had been treated with SOC treatment. The 
radiograph analysis set consisted of subjects in the full analysis set that had a pair of wrist and knee images 
rated for RSS and RGI-C scores. 
In general, missing data were to be treated as missing, unless otherwise specified.  
Subgroups based on RSS were pre-defined to match subgroup analyses in KRN23 Study UX023-CL201.The 1 
to 2 years’ span (for when the radiographs should have been taken) was pre-specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) and was intended to match approximately the duration of 40 to 64 weeks in Study 
UX023-CL201 to provide a reference to evaluate the treatment effects of KRN23. 
Outcomes from the two studies have been compared and, 95% confidence intervals for mean change in RSS, 
RGI-C, and standing height z-scores have been presented. 
Results 
Numbers analysed 
In this report, 52 subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 35 of the 52 subjects had pairs of bilateral 
wrist and knee radiographs taken 1 to 2 years apart between the ages of 5 and 14 years. Only these subjects 
could serve as controls for the radiologic outcomes in the UX023-CL002 study. The patients with radiographs 
might have a more severe course of the disease than patients without radiographs. The Applicant will be 
asked to discuss if the availability of radiographs introduces a bias (LoQ). 
The remaining 17 subjects (who did not have radiographs meeting these criteria) contributed other data.

Baseline data 
Please see table in the next section that compares the baseline data with study UX023-CL201. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Subjects in the Radiographic Analysis Set had received conventional therapy for approximately 8 years at the 
time of the post-baseline radiographs, with more than 6 years of treatment prior to the time of the baseline 
radiographs and an additional mean 1.7 years (median 1.97 years [102 weeks]) from the time of the 
baseline to post-baseline radiographs. 
Severity of rickets as measured by RSS: 
In the analysis of 47 paired matching baseline and post-baseline radiographs, total RSS score decreased by 
12% (from a mean of 1.33 to 1.17) at the time of the post-baseline radiographs.  
Subgroups were also evaluated based on whether baseline radiographs had higher RSS (RSS total score ≥  
1.5) or lower RSS (RSS total score < 1.5). Total RSS score decreased by 25% (from a mean of 1.88 to 1.42) 
in the higher RSS subgroup (25 paired radiographs), but increased by 26% (from a mean of 0.70 to 0.89) in 
the lower RSS subgroup (22 paired radiographs). 
In the RGI-C, positive scores indicate healing of rickets (+1.0=minimal healing, +2.0=substantial healing, 
+3.0=complete healing) and negative scores indicate worsening of rickets. 
Change in severity of rickets and bowing as measured by RGI-C 
The mean RGI-C global score was +0.79 for the overall group, +0.85 for the higher RSS subgroup (RSS total 
score ≥  1.5), and +0.69 for the lower RSS subgroup. All scores translate to less than minimal healing of 
rickets after prolonged conventional therapy.

Radiographic Analysis Set. 
Biochemistry Parameters 
At the time of the baseline radiographs, the mean serum phosphorus level in the overall group was 2.81 
mg/dL (0.91 mmol/L), below the lower limit of normal (LLN, 3.2 mg/dL [1.03 mmol/L]) for children. At the 
post-baseline radiographs, mean serum phosphorous level was 2.90 mg/dL (0.94 mmol/L). Similar results 
were observed in the Higher and Lower RSS subgroups. 
Mean alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration, a biomarker of rickets, was stable in the overall group (from 
443.10 to 419.52 U/L), higher RSS subgroup (from 486.91 to 455.25 U/L), and lower RSS subgroup (383 to 
388 U/L) (Table 11.3.1.1). Serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were not assessed because very few subjects had 
measurements for this parameter. 
Serum calcium and PTH levels remained similar at the time of the baseline and post-baseline radiographs. 
In summary, conventional therapy continued to correct some of the rachitic abnormalities associated with 
XLH in children in this retrospective longitudinal cohort study of skeletal outcomes in children with XLH. Mean 
phosphorus levels remained, however, below 3.0 mg/dL. Higher and lower RSS subgroups had similar serum 
phosphorus levels. ALP and PTH were higher in higher RSS group. 
Analysis performed across paediatric trials: 
Comparison of skeletal outcomes with KRN23 treatment vs conventional therapy 
To provide reference group data to use for comparative analyses of selected endpoints in Study UX023-
CL201, a non-interventional retrospective Study UX023-CL002 was conducted at XLH Centers of Excellence in

a similar paediatric XLH population who had received long-term conventional therapy with oral phosphate and 
active vitamin D. Study UX023-CL002, a total of 35 subjects (Radiographic Analysis Set) was used as the 
primary analysis dataset and included 60 paired wrist and knee images. Because RSS and RGI-C 
assessments were conducted in a blinded manner with some individual subjects contributing more than one 
pair of wrist and knee radiographs, it was necessary to characterize results based on data corresponding to 
the paired radiographs (N1) rather than to the subjects (N). 
Table 18: Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics in Study UX023-CL201 (Pre-
expansion Subjects) and Comparator Study UX023-CL002 
There were a smaller proportion of females in the UX023-CL201 cohort than in the UX023-CL002 cohort 
(50% and 68%). Other measured characteristics associated with rickets severity, were comparable. Baseline 
characteristics for Study UX023-CL002 in the above table were, however, based not on unique subjects but 
number of evaluable radiograph pairs.

Results 
Although no formal statistical comparisons were performed between the two studies, 95% confidence 
intervals for mean change in RSS, RGI-C, and standing height z-scores are presented:

Analysis Set 
RSS total score improved most in the Q2W groups and was comparable in Q4W and conventional treatment 
groups at week 40. 
The outcome for Study UX023-CL002 (above) was not based on unique subjects but evaluable paired 
radiographs (here, the 60 paired radiographs (N1) in the Radiographic Analysis Set  minus 13 of the post-
baseline paired radiographs determined by the central rater to have evidence of fused growth plates and 
therefore not evaluable for RSS). A post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore potential bias with 
subjects contributing multiple radiographs to the RSS analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, only one 
radiograph pair was selected for each subject based on the following criteria: 
1. If a radiograph pair had one or both radiographs showing growth plates fused or partially fused, the 
radiograph pair was excluded; 
2. If a subject had multiple radiograph pairs, the one with highest baseline RSS total score was selected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 76/130 
  
  
 
Based on these criteria, a total of 30 of the 35 subjects in the Radiographic Analysis Set qualified for the 
sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, mean (SD) RSS total scores decreased from 1.32 (0.83) for 
the baseline radiographs to 1.03 (0.75) for the post-baseline radiographs, a mean (SD) change of -0.28 
(1.07) to be compared with the difference of -0.16 in the above figure.  
An additional sensitivity analysis where the subjects baseline radiograph with lowest baseline RSS total score 
was selected was requested and has been performed. In this analysis there was no evident improvement 
compared to baseline in either knee or wrist and hence not in total score.  
Rickets healing by RGI-C 
Rickets healing with KRN23 in Study UX023-CL201 and conventional therapy in Study UX023-CL002 were 
also compared by evaluating RGI-C scores. Unlike the RSS system, the RGI-C system does not require that 
the epiphyses be open in order to assign a score so all radiographs in Study UX023-CL002 could be used 
(N1=60). 
Figure 10: Radiographic Impression of Change (RGI-C) (Mean ± SE) with KRN23 or Conventional 
Therapy in Study UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL002 in Overall Population 
Treatment with KRN23 for 64 weeks improved mean standing height Z score by 0.16 (95% CI, 0.09, 0.24) in 
the overall group while no changes in standing height Z score were observed after long-term treatment 
(median, 102 weeks) with conventional therapy. Standing height as measured by percentiles improved by 
2.0 percentiles with KRN23 treatment vs a change of 0.13 percentiles with conventional therapy. 
Comparisons of study results with external historical controls should always be interpreted with caution. 
However, in light of the presented data, it seems unlikely that treatment with KRN23 would be inferior in

efficacy compared with conventional treatment. In Addition, a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks may be 
more convenient for paediatric patients compared to conventional multiple daily doses of oral treatment.

Pharmacodynamics 
Serum Phosphate  
Burosumab treatment substantially increased serum 
phosphorus levels in both the Q2W and Q4W groups. 
Increases from Baseline in serum phosphorus were 
statistically significant at each study visit (p ≤ 0.001) 
for both dose groups and overall.  
The pattern of changes in serum phosphorus levels 
differ between the Q2W and Q4W groups, reflecting 
the difference in dose interval and the PK/PD 
relationship. In the Q2W group, mean (SD) serum 
phosphorus levels increased over time from 0.77 
[0.131] mmol/L at Baseline, to 1.08 [0.144] mmol/L at 
Week 64, reaching the low normal range as 
the dose was titrated.

2.5.3.  Planned paediatric study 
Study title: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of KRN23 Versus 
Oral Phosphate and Active Vitamin D Treatment in Paediatric Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
Protocol Number: UX023-CL301 
EudraCT Number: 2016‐000600‐29 
Population: subjects aged 1 to ≤ 12yrs with X-linked hypophosphataemia and x-ray evidence of rickets (RSS 
score minimum 2) 
Intervention: starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W KRN23 that may be increased at any time to 1.2 mg/kg. 
Comparator: oral phosphate and vitamin D 
Study design: Open label, randomised, phase III study over 64 weeks with 60 subjects randomised 1:1 to 
study drug or active control. 30 international sites are planned. Study design is summarised in the following 
diagram: 
Primary Objective: to evaluate the effect of KRN23 therapy in improving rickets in children with XLH 
compared with active control (oral phosphate/active vitamin D) 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: comparison between the KRN23 and active control groups: change in rickets at 
Week 40 as assessed by the RGI-C global score. 
The company describes additional secondary endpoints including clinician-reported outcome assessment 
using the RSS and RGI-C tools and PK and PD measurements as described for the phase II programme. The 
company has received input from the Paediatric Committee (EMA); there is not any additional comment at 
this stage. 
2.5.4.  Main studies in adults 
Results from the following studies have been submitted during the procedure; as the applicant did not pursue 
an indication for an adult population within the initial marketing authorisation application, only safety data

relevant to current indication has been considered by CHMP from these trials, where appropriate (see section 
Clinical Safety):  
Study UX023-CL303 
Ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 study of KRN23 in adults with 
XLH. Primary data analysis for the study, conducted after 24 weeks of study drug treatment is summarized.  
This is the only placebo-controlled study in the programme and therefore, the safety results are considered 
important for this paediatric application. The other studies are not described in detail as the Applicant has 
withdrawn the initial adult indication claim and requests conditional approval to be limited to paediatrics.

2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Paediatric population 5-12 years 
Design and conduct of the study 
UX023-CL201 is a randomised, multicentre, open-label, dose finding Phase 2 study. The study was conducted 
in prepubescent children aged 5-12 years with XLH to assess the PD and safety of KRN23 administered via 
subcutaneous (SC) injections monthly (Q4W) or biweekly (Q2W). 64 weeks of treatment data is now 
available.  
A number of interim analyses were performed at various time-points. They were descriptive in nature but 
have seemingly had an impact on study conduct and planned analyses (increased sample size, revised 
inclusion criteria, cut-off for RSS subgroup analyses). The study protocol was amended 5 times. In addition, 
results from this study had seemingly been communicated (i.e. before data cut-off for the current analyses) 
and eventually also been published. There were therefore concerns regarding the dissemination of results, 
their potential violation of the credibility of the study results that followed and potential impact on study 
integrity. The Applicant has, as requested, clarified  dates for protocol amendments, interim/primary analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 82/130 
  
  
 
 
 
and press releases and argues that it is unlikely that e.g. interim analyses and publications of study data 
while study UX023-CL201 was ongoing have introduced any bias. However, considering the open-label design 
and the lack of a concurrent control group, concern regarding the impact on study integrity that the interim 
analyses and the communication of study results may have had, remains. However, the CHMP was of the 
view that it is unlikely to significantly change the conclusions from the study. The outcomes from the phase 2 
study (UX023-CL201) will need to be confirmed in the ongoing phase 3. 
The study initially enrolled 36 paediatric subjects with XLH and radiographic evidence of bone disease (pre-
expansion subjects). When fully enrolled, the study was expanded (protocol amendment 3) to include 
additional subjects in cohort 3 for a total of approximately 50 subjects overall. Expansion subjects were 
required to have a level of rickets severity of at least 1.5 points at the knee as defined by the Rickets 
Severity Score (RSS) method.  
The Applicant has also presented a historical cohort study in a paediatric population (n=52) on conventional 
therapy, study UXO23-CL002. Baseline age and disease severity matched with subjects in study UX023-
CL201. Results from this study were used to put the treatment response observed in subjects treated with 
KRN23, into the context of the disease and the existing treatment (i.e., conventional therapy with oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study UX023-CL201 overall, the rickets severity RSS total score was reduced 50% from baseline to Week 
41, from 1.80 to 0.90; p<0.0001. In the Q2W group, the reduction was 61% (p=0.0001) RGI-C wrist, knee 
and global score increased (p<0.0001) in both Q2 and Q4 groups at Week 40. All patients received treatment 
Q2 after 40 weeks. The available data week 64 indicates similar effect size than the previously submitted 
week 40 data with mean RSS of 0.88. 
In a comparison with a historical cohort (study UX023-CL002, children with conventional therapy), a larger 
correction of rachitic abnormalities measured by RSS (38% vs 12%) and RGI-C (+1.38 vs +0.79) was seen 
in patients who received KRN23 in study UX023-CL201. RSS total score improved most in the Q2W subgroup 
and was comparable in Q4W and conventional historical treatment group at week 40. 
From baseline to week 64, a borderline increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year as 
well as improvement in standing height Z score +0.15 (p<0.0001). The mean improvement in 6MWT was 
+47 m overall (p<0.001) and +77 m in those with <80% predicted at baseline (p<0.0001). The results 
indicated better outcomes in the Q2 group.  
Improvement on POSNA/PODCI score in Sports/Physical Functioning was 33% to 42% and Pain/Comfort 35 
to 42% (p=0.0002). Thus, improvements in variables of height and 6MWT compared to baseline were noted. 
A tendency to better results in the Q2 group compared to Q4 in both laboratory measurements (such as 
phosphate) and these clinical parameters gives some support for a clinically meaningful effect of the drug 
especially for the most affected individuals. 
However, the magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients with the 
current study design regarding variables growth, 6 MWT, functional disability and pain. A biological variation 
with age has not been established for this group of subjects. Therefore, no claims on these parameters were 
accepted in the SmPC 5.1, results from the confirmatory randomized phase 3 study (specific obligation; study 
UX023-CL301: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of KRN23 Versus 
Oral Phosphate and Active Vitamin D Treatment in Paediatric Patients with XLH) are awaited and they will be 
submitted according to the due date setup in the specific obligation.

Serum phosphorus levels increased to low normal range in (p<0.0001) in Q2W group. More steady 
phosphate profile was achieved with Q2W than Q4W. Mean (SD) serum ALP levels decreased to 395 (95) U/L 
at Week 40 (mean change: -13%, p < 0.0001) and to 369 (76) U/L at Week 64 (-20%, p < 0.0001); 
decreases were similar in the two dose groups. Mean (SD) serum BALP levels decreased to 134 (38) μg/L at 
Week 40 (mean change: -17%) and to 115 (31) μg/L at Week 64 (mean change: -29%), and decreases were 
similar in the two dose groups. 
The proposed posology in the SmPC is not in line with the posology used in the main paediatric study UX023-
CL201 (that was also a dose finding study, starting from doses as low as 0.1mg/kg) but the proposed 
starting dose reflects the therapeutic dose level (0.8mg/kg Q2W) in study UX023-CL201. Thereafter, 
individual titration is needed for achieving low normal phosphate levels and this should be performed 
according to the phosphate levels as stated in the SmPC. This dosing strategy has also been implemented in 
the paediatric study UX023-CL205 through 24 weeks using a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. From a safety 
point of view, a starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg is the lowest maintenance dose in study UX023-CL201 and is now 
advised in the SmPC section 4.2. The dose is proposed to be titrated stepwise every four weeks with 
0.4 mg/kg; i.e dose of 0.8 mg/kg is achieved already after four weeks of treatment. This rather conservative 
approach to dose titration may change after additional safety results from the conditional randomized phase 
3 study (specific obligation; study UX023-CL301). 
Paediatric population 1-4 years 
Design and conduct of the study 
Study UX023-CL205 is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old with XLH 
who are naïve to therapy or have previously received conventional therapy with oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D to assess the safety, PD, PK, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 64 weeks. The current analysis includes data from 13 subjects through 
week 40. Subjects who complete the study may continue into an extension study. This study is being 
conducted at three centers in the United States (specific obligation study UX023-CL205). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the study UX023-CL205, Week 40 data (PK, PD and safety) for all 13 enrolled patients age 1 to 4 years old 
have now been reported, study UX023-CL205. The pharmacodynamics results, RSS and RGI-C indicate 
similar response than seen in children 5-12 years. In this study, length/standing height, expressed both as a 
percentile for age and gender and as Z scores, tended to decrease instead of expected increase. No claims on 
growth are included in the SmPC for any age group. The final study results at 64 weeks will be submitted 
according to the due date setup in the specific obligation (specific obligation study UX023-CL205). 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The method of administration (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, Q2) is a potential general advantage 
compared to conventional supplementation therapy with large doses of oral phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D, 3-5 
times daily. Comparisons of (paediatric) open-label study results with external historical controls on 
conventional therapy should always be interpreted with caution. Burosumab did increase serum phosphate 
levels into the low normal range, although the data from randomized two different dosing groups seems to 
indicate a smaller rise of serum phosphate compared with conventional treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 84/130 
  
  
In study UX023-CL201, all included paediatric 52 subjects completed week 40. This supports a good 
tolerability of burosumab as well as a patient/caregiver preference to the experimental therapy compared to 
the conventional therapy they had received before the study. The laboratory endpoints as well as nearly all 
radiological and clinical efficacy variables indicated better outcomes in Q2 dosing group compared to Q4. 
Generally a more pronounced effect was seen in the severe RSS subgroup. 
Laboratory variables s-phosphate and ALP can be considered as surrogate markers for disease severity in X-
linked hypophosphataemia and their demonstrated improvement indicate benefit of the treatment. Any 
radiological evidence of rickets healing, as observed in the studies, can be considered supportive for that 
pharmacological effect is clinically relevant.  
The CHMP considers that efficacy results from the age group 5-12 years can be extrapolated to ages 1 to 4 
years old, in light of the available data on pharmacodynamics parameters from this age group. Study UX023-
CL205 is considered as a specific obligation. Final results of Study UX023-CL205 will be submitted in line with 
the due date setup in the specific obligation.  
The RSS scoring methodology has previously been used for the assessment of the severity of nutritional 
rickets. There is no golden standard method of scoring radiological changes in XLH. However, the Applicant 
has used RSS scale now in study UX023-CL201 and for historical controls in UX023-CL002. For this orphan 
disease, finding another XLH population in order to further validate the scale seems difficult. Improvements 
of these parameters with burosumab were shown. The magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to 
interpret in paediatric patients with the current study design. This is also a concern regarding variables 
growth, 6 MWT, functional disability and pain. UX023-CL201 is a randomized, open-label, dose finding, phase 
2 study to assess the pharmacodynamics and safety of the anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23, in paediatric 
patients with XLH and is considered as a specific obligation. Final results will be submitted by the Applicant in 
line with the due date setup in the specific obligation. 
As no control group without active treatment was included, a comparison of such (paediatric) open-label 
study results with external historical controls on conventional therapy thus did not allow a fully 
comprehensive assessment of efficacy. As comprehensive data on the product were not available, a 
conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the submission and a comparator-
controlled study is being performed to provide fully comprehensive data eventually. Study UX023-CL301is a 
randomized, open-label, phase 3 Study to assess the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety of the anti-FGF23 
antibody, KRN23, versus oral phosphate and active vitamin D in paediatric patients with XLH and is 
considered as a specific obligation. Final results will be submitted by the Applicant in line with the due date 
setup in the specific obligation.  
For this skeletal disease it is appropriate to limit the indication to children and adolescents with growing 
skeletons as reflected by the studied population: The current paediatric studies have included only children 
with radiographic evidence of bone disease but very mildly affected individuals with XLH may have 
hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms throughout the life.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety evaluation for Crysvita includes safety data from 6 studies in XLH and 1 study with tumour-induced 
osteomalacia (TIO) or epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) (indications not included in the current application).

In the paediatric primary safety data set from the ongoing, open label, repeat dose study UX023-CL201, 52 
children aged 5-12 years were treated with KRN23 for at least 64 weeks. The 36 pre-expansion subjects had 
reached at least the Week 88 visit by the data cut-off date (01-Dec-2016). After Week 64, all subjects 
received KRN23 Q2W. There was a slightly higher mean exposition to KRN23 in subjects randomized to 
injection every 14 days (Q2W) compared to every 28 days (Q4W) (1.05 vs 1.01 mg/kg/administration). All 
enrolled subjects completed Week 64.  
Enrolment is closed for the ongoing open label study UX023-CL205. 13 subjects (9 boys [69.2%] and 4 girls 
[30.8%]) aged 1-4 years (mean[SD] 2.9[1.15] years) have been enrolled. All 13 subjects have reached week 
40 at data cut-off date (20-Apr-2017). The maximum treatment length at data cut-off date was 46 weeks (4 
subjects). All subjects received all planned doses of burosumab at a prescribed dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
through Week 20. Ten subjects continued to receive burosumab at 0.8 mg/kg Q2W through the data cut-off 
date (at least Week 40). Three subjects had dose increases to 1.2 mg/kg Q2W based on the protocol-
specified dose adjustment criteria. For all 3 subjects with dose increases, burosumab dose was continued at 
the increased dose (1.2 mg/kg Q2W) through the data cut-off date. 
In the adult primary safety data set from completed studies KRN23-INT001/002 and ongoing studies UX023-
CL203 (data cut-off date 04-Mar-2016) and UX023-CL304 (data cut-off date 19-May-2016) (all open label), 
31 subjects aged 19-66 years were treated with KRN23 for a median of 79.9 weeks with a mean total KRN23 
dose of 12.4 mg/kg. The cumulative exposure in the adult primary data set was 44.1 subject years. 
In ongoing study UX023-CL303 (data cut-off date 22-Dec-2016), 134 subjects were enrolled and 
randomized 1:1 to KRN23 (68 subjects) or placebo (66 subjects). Throughout the double-blind Placebo-
controlled Treatment Period, the mean duration of exposure to study drug was similar in both treatment 
groups and indicates all subjects received the full 24-weeks of protocol-specified treatment. Through the data 
cut-off, subjects have been exposed to KRN23 for up to 367 days (~1 year). The total subject-years of 
exposure to KRN23 were 47.86 years.

Throughout the double-blind period (Weeks 0-24), both treatment groups received stable doses of blinded 
study drug treatment (based on 1 mg/kg dosing). In both groups, the observed median weight-based dose of 
blinded study drug was 1.0 mg/kg. 
The protocol specified criteria for treatment assignment unblinding and dose adjustments due to elevated 
serum phosphorus levels. Most subjects did not require such dose adjustments. Through the double-blind 
period, five (7.3%) subjects in the KRN23 group had treatment unblinded per protocol. One subject (207-
303) had one dose withheld at Week 12 per protocol. The dose was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg and maintained at 
that level through Week 24 in four of the five subjects; one subject required an additional dose reduction. 
Furthermore, 15 subjects with tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) or epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) have 
been treated with KRN23 in study UX023T- CL201 (data cut-off date 25-May-2016) with a total cumulative 
exposure of 6.47 patient years.  
In the single-dose adult XLH studies, the mean KRN23 total dose ranged from 6.1 mg for intravenous (IV) 
administration to 38.2 mg for subcutaneous (SC) administration, corresponding to 0.09 mg/kg for IV 
administration and 0.59 mg/kg for SC administration, respectively. 
Adverse events 
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201 
Safety data in study UX023-CL201 were evaluated through the data cut-off date of 01 December 2016. 
Safety data were available for most subjects beyond Week 64. At Week 64, the beginning of the Treatment 
Extension Period, the dose regimen for subjects in the Q4W group changed to Q2W. The 36 pre-expansion 
subjects had reached at least the Week 88 visit by the data cut-off date. While all subjects received KRN23 
Q2W after Week 64, data are reported by the initial regimen to which subjects were randomized. 
All subjects (52 patients) reported a TEAE. 96% of them experienced a TEAE that was Grade 2 or less in 
maximum severity (Table 21). Two subjects experienced grade 3 TEAEs (tooth abscess and rash, 
respectively), none of which was considered related to study treatment. One subject experienced two 
concurrent serious TEAEs of pyrexia and myalgia. Further information is given under “Serious adverse events 
and deaths”.

The most frequent TEAEs (> 30% incidence) were headache (65.4%), cough (53.8%), nasopharyngitis 
(48.1%), pain in extremity (46.2%), vomiting (42.3%), injection site reaction (40.4%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (40.4%), arthralgia (38.5%), injection site erythema (38.5%), pyrexia (36.5%), and 
oropharyngeal pain (32.7%). 
One subject experienced a TEAE “blood phosphorous increased”. This is further discussed under Laboratory 
findings.  
Most events of headache were mild with an average duration of approximately 1 day. Most events of 
vomiting were mild with a duration of 1 to 2 days. The events of skin papilloma represented common warts 
according to the Applicant.  
Overall, 69.2% of subjects experienced TEAEs related to treatment (Table 23). The most frequent related 
TEAEs (incidence > 10%) were those associated with SC administration of study drug (please see below 
under Adverse events of specific interest).  
One event of nephrocalcinosis was reported. Please refer to Adverse events of specific interest below for 
further discussion.

Study UX023-CL205 
Evaluation of safety data (n=13) up to Week 40 of treatment revealed no significant safety concerns.  
All 13 subjects (100%) experienced at least one TEAE up to Week 24 the study. The most frequent TEAEs (> 
30% incidence) were cough (76.9%), pyrexia (61.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (53.8%), vomiting 
(46.2%), rhinorrhea (38.5%), pharyngitis streptococcal (30.8%), and diarrhoea (30.8%). All of the most 
frequent TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs reported as related to study drug were experienced 
by 5 subjects (38.5%). The most frequently reported related TEAEs were within the SOC of General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions (please refer to Immunological events below).  
One severe (Grade 3) TEAE of food allergy was recorded, but considered unrelated to study drug.  
Adult population (supportive data) 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
In the single-dose studies, approximately 81% of the subjects experienced a TEAE, most of whom (72%) had 
a TEAE of Grade 2 or less. No subject reported a SAE and no subject died. 
In the adult repeat-dose studies (KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304), all of the 
subjects (31 patients) experienced a TEAE, most of whom (77%) had a TEAE of Grade 2 or less. 7 subjects 
(23%) reported 7 SAEs which were considered not related to study drug (see below). Three subjects (10%) 
were discontinued from a study by the investigator due to a TEAE (see below). These TEAEs were considered 
related to study drug. 
In repeat-dose studies of adult XLH, TEAEs reported by more than 30% of the subjects were nasopharyngitis 
(17 [55%]), arthralgia (15 [48%]), back pain (14 [45%]), and pain in extremity (12 [39%]). Drug-related 
TEAEs reported in more than approximately 10% of the subjects included injection site reaction (6 [19%]), 
arthralgia (4 [13%]), diarrhoea (3 [9.7%]), and injection site erythema (3 [9.7%])

Table 25 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported for ≥ 5% Subjects in Either Treatment Group -- 
Double-blind Period (Safety Analysis Set) 
SOCs in which TEAEs were most commonly reported with imbalance between treatment groups were: 
  SOC Nervous system disorders (KRN23: 38.2%; placebo: 24.2%): The imbalance between the 
treatment groups was primarily attributed to the higher incidences of headache (11.8% vs 7.6%), 
dizziness (10.3% vs 6.1%), and RLS (11.8% vs 6.1%) in the KRN23 group than in the placebo group 
  SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (KRN23: 36.8%; placebo: 45.5%): The 
imbalance between the treatment groups was primarily attributed to the higher incidence of 
arthralgia (8.8% vs 24.2%), pain in extremity (7.4% vs 15.2%), musculoskeletal pain (7.4% vs 
15.2%), and bone pain (1.5% vs 6.1%) in the placebo group than in the KRN23 group. 
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for eight (11.8%) subjects in the KRN23 group and nine (13.6%) subjects in 
the placebo group; no Grade 4 TEAEs were reported. These events were not related to study drug except for 
one event of Grade 3 pain in extremity (verbatim: acute feet pain) assessed as possibly related to study 
drug. Other Grade 3 TEAEs that occurred in more than one subject included tooth abscess (KRN23: 4.4%; 
placebo: 0) and diarrhoea (KRN23: 1.5%; placebo: 1.5%). 
Study UX023T-CL210 (TIO/ENS) 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (frequency of ≥ 3 subjects) by subject incidence were pain in extremity 
(5 [33%]), upper respiratory tract infection (5 [33%]), and arthralgia (4 [27%]). All other TEAEs were each 
reported in 1 or 2 subjects. No related TEAEs occurred at a frequency of ≥ 3 subjects. TEAEs considered

related to study drug were dysgeusia, injection site pain, rash, and vitamin D deficiency, each reported in one 
subject.  
One subject experienced a serious TEAE of neoplasm progression that resulted in discontinuation, deemed 
unlikely related to the study drug. Please see below for further information.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No death was reported in any of the seven paediatric or adult KRN23 studies included in the safety evaluation 
set.  
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201  
No death was reported. One subject in the study UX023-CL201 experienced two concurrent serious TEAEs 
(pyrexia and myalgia). Eosinophil percentage was 14.2% while other white cell differential parameters were 
in the normal range, which later normalized. The subject was negative for anti-KRN23 antibodies at all time 
points. No action was taken with KRN23 in response to the events, and study treatment was ongoing as of 
the data cut-off for this report, with no interruptions in the subsequent study dosing regimen. 
The SAEs were assessed as moderate in severity and deemed possibly related to KRN23.  
Study UX023-CL205 
No deaths were reported. One subject experienced an SAE of tooth abscess. The subject had a relevant 
medical history of tooth abscess. No action was taken with regard to burosumab treatment; the subject 
received the Week 36 dose (1.2 mg/kg) on schedule and continues on treatment as of the data cut-off date 
for this report. The event of tooth abscess was considered moderate in severity and unlikely related to 
burosumab. 
Adult population (supportive data) 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
In total, seven SAEs were reported in the primary adult safety dataset: cervical spinal stenosis, 
musculoskeletal chest pain, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, small intestinal obstruction, cholecystitis 
acute and hypertensive crisis (1 subject each). 
Study UX023-CL303 
Through the double-blind period (through Week 24), four subjects experienced serious TEAEs. None of those 
were assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug. In the KRN23 group, two (2.9%) subjects 
experienced serious TEAEs (irritable bowel syndrome, back pain). In the placebo group, two (3.0%) subjects 
experienced serious TEAEs (upper respiratory tract infection, invasive ductal breast carcinoma). 
During the Treatment Continuation Period, after all subjects started to receive open-label KRN23, three 
subjects, who were initially in the placebo group, had KRN23-emergent serious TEAEs. One subject each 
experienced cervical spinal stenosis, palpitations, and partial seizures; none were assessed by the 
Investigator as related to study drug. 
No deaths were reported through the data cut-off date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 93/130 
  
  
Study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS) 
One subject experienced a serious TEAE of neoplasm progression that resulted in discontinuation. The 
mesenchymal tumour was the reason for inclusion in the study and not a de novo malignancy, and the 
subject had suffered from multiple episodes of tumour progression and metastases for almost 25 years. 
All eleven reported serious TEAE in the primary and supporting safety datasets have been considered as not 
related to treatment by the Investigator. In one case (lung adenocarcinoma), the lesion was could be 
detected prior to exposure to the study drug. 
Adverse events of specific interest 
Predefined TEAEs of interest included ISRs, hypersensitivity (immunogenicity), hyperphosphataemia, ectopic 
mineralization, and RLS. 
The distribution of events in the placebo vs treatment group in study UX023-CL303, the only placebo-
controlled study, is given in Table 26. Further details for the different studies are given below.  
Table 26 Summary of Predefined TEAEs of Interest in Double-blind Period (Safety Analysis Set) 
Injection site reactions (ISR) 
Paediatric population: 
Study UX023-CL201 
34 subjects (65.4%) experienced TEAEs of injection site reaction. All events were mild in severity. As 
expected, the incidence of injection site reaction was greater with the Q2W regimen (73.1%) as compared 
with Q4W regimen (57.7%) because of the greater frequency of injections. Injection site reactions were 
considered related to treatment by the investigators for 30 subjects (57.7%). Injection site reactions were 
not associated with any severe hypersensitivity reactions and generally represented localized irritation. 
Study UX023-CL205 
Three subjects (23.1%) experienced TEAEs of Injection site reactions (injection site erythema, injection site 
pruritus, injection site reaction [1 subject each (7.7%)]).

Adult population:  
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
The subject incidence of ISRs in the adult studies was lower than in the paediatric study. Across the adult 
studies, the subject incidence of ISRs was 35%. Most ISRs were Grade 1 (29%), occurred within 1 day of 
drug administration (95%), and lasted 1 to 3 days, and resolved (98%). 
Study UX023-CL303 
Twelve (9%) subjects in the Total KRN23 group (combined double-blind and open-label periods) experienced 
KRN23-emergent ISRs. The exposure-adjusted event incidence was 0.37 events/year. Through the data cut-
off, in addition to the PTs observed during the double-blind period, injection site haemorrhage of mild 
severity and injection site hypersensitivity of moderate severity were reported in one (1.5%) subject each in 
the KRN23 group 
In the supporting safety dataset, one ISR in study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS) have been reported so far. 
Hypersensitivity 
Paediatric subset 
Study UX023-CL201 
23 subjects (44.2%) with hypersensitivity were recorded. In 8 subjects (15.4%), the event was considered at 
least possibly related to treatment. The most frequent hypersensitivity adverse events (experienced by > 1 
subject) were rash (25.0%), injection site rash (7.7%), dermatitis (3.8%), allergic dermatitis (3.8%), contact 
dermatitis (3.8%), and urticaria (3.8%). All hypersensitivity adverse events were mild or moderate except 
for one event of severe rash that was considered not related to treatment but rather due to swimming in a 
lake.  
Three subjects experienced TEAEs of rash or pustular rash that were at least possibly related to treatment. In 
addition, three subjects experienced TEAEs that were suggestive of other hypersensitivity reactions: swelling 
face (verbatim: “swelling under the eyes”; one subject), urticaria and lip swelling (one subject), and urticaria 
(one subject, who also experienced a related TEAE of rash). In one of these subjects, pustular rash on the 
face recurred after three of the subject’s injections. In the other cases, the event did not recur with 
subsequent injections. 
Study UX023-CL205 
Four subjects (30.8%) experienced hypersensitivity adverse events: rash urticaria, mild face swelling and 
environmental allergies (1 subject each). All events were mild and were considered unlikely / unrelated to 
study drug. 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
The pre-specified search strategy identified 7 adult subjects (23%) who reported 10 hypersensitivity TEAEs of 
mild/moderate severity. Three adult subjects (9.7%) reported events that were deemed related to study 
drug, whereof one subject experienced a Grade 2 injection site urticaria that led to discontinuation from the 
study. 
After the data cut-off date, a serious, life-threatening event of angioedema was reported in study UX023-
CL203. The patient was concomitantly treated with lisinopril, and after approximately four weeks after 
Assessment report

withdrawal of the ACE-inhibitor, treatment with KRN23 could be continued without recurrence of the 
angioedema so far. As the case was heavily confounded by co-suspect ACE inhibitor and the subject 
continued on study medication without rechallenge hypersensitivity reactions, the sponsor considered the 
event related to lisinopril and not related to KRN23.  
Study UX023-CL303 
A total of seven (5.2%) subjects treated with KRN23 (combined double-blind and open-label periods) 
experienced a KRN23-emergent hypersensitivity reaction; the exposure-adjusted event incidence in the Total 
KRN23 group was 0.14 events/year. In addition to the PTs observed during the double-blind period, swollen 
tongue (mild severity, not treatment-related) and injection site hypersensitivity (moderate severity; definitely 
treatment-related) were each reported in one subject through the data cut-off. 
Study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS)  
One case of hypersensitivity (rash) has been reported so far. 
Hyperphosphataemia 
Because of the proposed mechanism of action of KRN23, hyperphosphataemia is considered a potential risk 
with treatment.  
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201 
Serum phosphorus measurements did not exceed the upper limit of normal in any of the paediatric subjects.   
One subject experienced a mild TEAE “blood phosphorous increased” (verbatim term for provided by the 
investigator “serum phosphorous level above target range”). However, serum phosphorous was 5.2 mg/dL 
and within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg/dL).  
Study UX023-CL205 
As of the data cut-off, no subject experienced a serum phosphorus level above the normal range (3.2–6.1 
mg/dL).  
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
Across the adult repeat-dose XLH studies, 1 subject (3%) from Study UX023-CL203 had a single serum 
phosphorus measurement of 4.9 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L), which is above the upper limit of normal (4.5 mg/dL 
[1.5 mmol/L]), but below the dose-limiting toxicity threshold of 6.5 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L).  
In adult single-dose studies, 1 of 47 subjects (2%) from Study KRN23-US-02 had a serum phosphorus level 
above the upper limit of normal. The subject had an elevated serum phosphorus concentration of 5.2 mg/dL 
(1.7 mmol/L) on Day 12, after subcutaneous administration. No TEAE was associated with this finding. 
Study UX023-CL303 
During the double-blind period (through Week 24), TEAEs of hyperphosphataemia were reported for four 
(5.9%) subjects in the KRN23 group and no subjects in the placebo group. Hyperphosphataemia events were 
expected in this study based on the proposed mechanism of action of KRN23 and data from previous studies. 
Protocol specified dose reduction effectively managed hyperphosphataemia and elevated serum phosphorus 
levels. All hyperphosphataemia TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as mild (Grade 1) in severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 96/130 
  
  
Through the data cut-off date, a total of seven (5.2%) subjects treated with KRN23 (combined double-blind 
and open-label periods) experienced KRN23-emergent hyperphosphataemia TEAEs. The exposure-adjusted 
event incidence in the Total KRN23 group was 0.14 events/year. In addition to subjects with events observed 
during the double-blind period, three additional subjects in the placebo group who crossed over to open-label 
KRN23 experienced hyperphosphataemia of mild or moderate severity. All events resolved with dose 
reduction. 
Ectopic mineralization 
Soft tissue calcification has been reported from pre-clinical studies. During the studies, all subjects have been 
monitored with renal ultrasound and cardiac CT. Regular monitoring with renal ultrasound as well as serum 
phosphate is recommended in the SmPC.  
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201 
Ectopic mineralization (EM) of the heart was evaluated by ECHO and was graded from 0 (none) to 8 
(marked). EM was Grade 0 for all 52 subjects at Baseline and for all post-baseline assessments except for EM 
Grade 1 for two subjects at Week 88. 1 of these subjects had a EM Grade 0 at Week 112, and the other had 
no further assessments as of the data cut off.  
Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were both within normal 
limits at Baseline and remained within normal limits at Week 64. 
The presence of nephrocalcinosis was also evaluated by renal ultrasound based on a 5-point scale ranging 
from 0 (normal) to 4 (stone formation) (Table 27).  
A total of nine subjects had changes of 1 point in renal ultrasound scores during the study: two subjects had 
decreases and seven subjects had increases (one subject, from 0 to 1; four subjects, from 1 to 2; and 2 
subjects, from 2 to 3). A history of nephrocalcinosis prior to study entry was noted for 12 subjects (23%), 
including five of the seven subjects who had increased scores from baseline. Ad-hoc analyses were conducted 
to compare the seven subjects who had increased nephrocalcinosis scores post-baseline to other subjects in 
the study. The seven subjects with increased nephrocalcinosis scores generally had higher iPTH levels and 
higher urinary calcium excretion (2- and 24-hour calcium/creatinine ratios) at Baseline compared with the 
other subjects in the study. None of the seven instances of increased nephrocalcinosis scores was associated 
with a TEAE, an increase in urinary calcium, any clinically meaningful changes in iPTH, or a decrease in renal 
function (eGFR).

n, number of subjects with an event; m = number of subjects with assessments at both Baseline and at Week 64. Percentages are based on the 
total number of subjects (N = 52). Shaded cells indicate no change from Baseline. aNephrocalcinosis was scored based on a 5 point scale   
bData were not available at Week 64 for two subjects 
One subject in study UX023-CL201 was reported to have a TEAE of moderate nephrocalcinosis considered 
possibly related to treatment that was noted at the week 40 visit. The subject’s renal ultrasound scores for 
nephrocalcinosis were 0 at baseline and at Weeks 16, 40, and 64. According to the Applicant, there was a 
discrepancy in reading of one renal ultrasound at Week 40. A TEAE was recorded by the investigator based 
on the clinical site's renal ultrasound report at Week 40 suggesting a beginning of nephrocalcinosis. In the 
judgement of the central reader the nephrocalcinosis score at Week 40 was 0 and there was no 
nephrolithiasis. The Applicant states that since the subject's nephrocalcinosis scores were 0 at all time-points, 
including Weeks 64 and 88 a beginning of nephrocalcinosis was likely not present at Week 40. 
Study UX023-CL205 
No subject TEAE of ectopic calcification was reported. No subject had nephrocalcinosis at baseline or at Week 
40. Results from 64 are awaited.   
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
Out of 31 patients assessed by coronary CT at INT-001 baseline, none had evidence of clinically-significant 
coronary mineralization. 1/31 (3%) subjects had an increased coronary calcium score during the study. The 
subject was a 40 year old Caucasian male with XLH with increased iPTH and serum calcium, factors likely 
contributing to elevated risk of developing ectopic mineralization. His maximum calcium score was 48 
Agatston units (A.U.). Coronary calcium scores of ~50 A.U. in a 40-year old male likely represent a low risk 
of development of coronary heart disease.  
One subject in Study KRN23-INT-002 experienced Grade 2 nephrolithiasis, which was considered related to 
treatment. However, the event is confounded by the subject’s pre-existing nephrocalcinosis and history of 
nephrolithiasis.  
In Study UX023-CL203, most subjects had no nephrocalcinosis on renal ultrasound at baseline or at Week 
24 of KRN23 treatment. Two subjects had Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at both visits, and 2 subjects had Grade 
2 nephrocalcinosis at both visits. No subject had a documented increase in nephrocalcinosis between baseline 
and Week 24.

Study UX023-CL303 
At baseline, echocardiography reported ectopic mineralisation grade 1 in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo 
group and 7 subjects (10.3%) in the KRN23 group. At Week 24, seven subjects (10.6%) in the placebo group 
and 1 subject (1.5%) had shifted from grade 0 to grade 1. No subject in either group had shifted from grade 
1 to a higher grade but 1 subject (1.5%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects in the KRN23 group (4.4%) had 
shifted from grade 1 to grade 0. 
At baseline, 39 subjects (59.1%) in the placebo group displayed nephrocalcinosis by renal ultrasound (32 
subjects [48.5%] grade 1; 7 subjects [10.6%] grade 2).  In the KRN23 group, 34 subjects (50%) had 
nephrocalcinosis: 23 subjects (33.8%) grade 1, 9 subjects (13.2%) grade 2 and 2 subjects (2.9%) grade 3.  
The shift in nephrocalcinosis grade from baseline to Week 24 are summarised in Table 28.

Percentage is based on N. Grey boxes indicate no change from baseline.  
Through the data cut-off date, four (3.0%) subjects (two subjects from each group) experienced ectopic 
mineralization TEAEs. Three of these subjects experienced nephrolithiasis. In the fourth case, 
nephrocalcinosis was reported as a TEAE in a subject from the placebo group the same day as the first dose 
of open-label KRN22. The renal ultrasound was unchanged (grade 2; no nephrolithiasis) Week 24 compared 
to baseline.  
Study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS) 
There are no reports of ectopic mineralisation in this study. 
Restless legs syndrome 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs 
and an uncontrollable urge to move them. The aetiology of RLS is unknown, but a genetic component has 
been proposed. RLS appears to be related to a variety of chronic conditions including diabetes, kidney failure, 
thyroid disease, as well as electrolyte imbalances and use of certain. It is associated with chronic 
hyperphosphataemia in renal dialysis patients and is reversible with dialysis.

Paediatric population 
RLS was not reported in any subject in the paediatric population (studies UX023-CL201 and UX023-
CL205). 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
Five adult subjects reported non-serious events of RLS in studies KRN23-INT-001 and KRN23-INT-002. Of 
the 5 subjects, 3 had a documented medical history of RLS at baseline. One adult subject experienced a TEAE 
of RLS, which was Grade 3 in severity and led to discontinuation from the study KRN23-INT-002. The RLS 
resolved or returned to baseline level after discontinuing KRN23. Two subjects who experienced RLS in 
KRN23-INT-002, including the subject who discontinued from the study, subsequently enrolled in Study 
UX023-CL203. Interim data from UX023-CL203 show that neither of these subjects has reported RLS after 24 
weeks of treatment. 
Study UX023-CL303 
A total of four (3%) subjects (two in each treatment group) entered the study with a documented medical 
history of RLS. Throughout the double-blind period, a total of eight (11.8%) subjects in the KRN23 group and 
five (7.6%) subjects in the placebo group had a TEAE of RLS or limb discomfort. Two of the four subjects 
(one in each treatment group) with a prior history of RLS experienced new or worsening RLS reported as a 
TEAE. Through the data cut-off date, a total of ten (7.5%) subjects treated with KRN23 (combined double-
blind and open-label periods) experienced KRN23-emergent RLS TEAEs. All RLS events were mild or 
moderate in severity and most were considered related to study drug; no RLS event was considered a serious 
TEAE. As of the data cut-off date, most RLS events were ongoing. No RLS event resulted in treatment 
discontinuation or study withdrawal. 
Study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS)  
Two subjects reported RLS, but none were considered treatment related. 
Laboratory findings 
Calcium and iPTH 
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201 
Hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia, defined as serum calcium levels outside the age-adjusted normal limits 
(based on overnight fasting [minimum 4 hours] values collected at Screening Visit 2), were exclusion criteria 
in the study. 
One subject had a TEAE of hypercalcaemia at Week 6 that was of mild severity. No TEAE of hypercalciuria 
was reported in the paediatric subset.  
Mean (SD) serum iPTH concentrations were 44.32 (25.531) pg/mL at Baseline, 50.97 (19.797) pg/mL at 
Week 36, and 51.48 (19.617) pg/mL at Week 64. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were noted 
in mean serum iPTH, nor were clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups noted in mean 
serum iPTH or in shifts from Baseline (Table 29), but all subjects but four had a maximum PTH value higher 
Assessment report

than baseline. Serum iPTH concentrations more than twice the ULN were evaluated as a potential indicator of 
secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Two subjects had serum iPTH concentrations >2xULN at 
Screening or Baseline visits. Both subjects showed decreases in serum iPTH concentration over time. Three 
subjects had a single, transitory post-baseline iPTH concentration > 2XULN. 
Table 29  Serum iPTH Concentration (pg/mL) (Mean ± SE) by Regimen (Safety Analysis Set) 
Study UX023-CL205 
Hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia, defined as serum calcium levels outside the age-adjusted normal limits 
(based on overnight fasting [minimum 4 hours] values collected at Screening Visit 2), were exclusion criteria 
in the study. 
One subject had an asymptomatic serum calcium elevation at Week 12. One subject was reported to have 
Grade 1 adverse event of blood parathyroid hormone increased at approximately Week 12. This was an 
increase from baseline; however, it was lower than at the Screening Visit. Overall, no clinically meaningful 
changes from baseline were noted in mean serum iPTH or in shifts from baseline. 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
One subject reported a TEAE of hypercalciuria at Week 24, which was mild in severity and did not result in a 
change in KRN23 treatment. The subject had had stable Grade 1 nephrocalcinosis at both Baseline and Week 
24 and no nephrolithiasis. 
Study UX023-CL303 
Individuals with elevated serum calcium levels (≥ 10.8 mg/dL [2.7 mmol/L]) were excluded from the study. 
At baseline and throughout the study, serum calcium levels generally remained within the normal reference 
range (8.6– 10.2 mg/dL). Overall, serum calcium levels and changes from baseline remained consistent 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 101/130 
  
  
 
throughout the double-blind period, with no meaningful differences observed between KRN23 and placebo 
treatment groups. 
The mean serum iPTH concentration was above the ULN (> 72 pg/mL) in both treatment groups at baseline. 
The mean (SE) serum iPTH concentration was 98.9 (7.60) pg/mL (range: 23–447) in the KRN23 group and 
95.2 (4.89) pg/mL (range: 29–242) in the placebo group. At week 24, there was a trend to lower PTH in the 
treatment group, as shown in Table 30.

Elevated FGF-23 
Paediatric population 
In paediatric study UX023-CL201, mean (SD) serum total FGF23 concentrations at Baseline were 0.157 
(0.094) ng/mL (n = 52). Mean values increased during treatment through 175 (119) ng/mL at Week 8 (n = 
52) to 470 (253) ng/mL at Week 64, an almost 3000-fold increase from baseline.  
Free FGF23 levels in the paediatric population were not recorded before week 38. At Week 64, 35 subjects 
(67.3%) had reported results of 1500 pg/mL, which was the upper limit of quantitation for this assay, and 17 
(32.7%), had free FGF23 levels in a range of 778 to 1495 pg/mL.  
Mean (SD) serum total FGF23 concentrations at Baseline were 0.417 (0.402) ng/mL. At Week 24, mean total 
FGF23 concentrations increased to 455 (107) ng/mL and ranged from 269 to 624 ng/mL. 
Mean (SD) serum free FGF23 concentrations at Baseline were 79 (16) pg/mL and ranged from 54 to 106 
pg/mL. At Week 24, mean free FGF23 concentrations increased to 1366 (213) pg/mL and ranged from 939 to 
1500 pg/mL. 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23-INT-001/002 and UX023-CL203 
FGF23 was elevated in KRN23 treatment in studies KRN23-INT-001/002 and UX023-CL203.  
In study UX023-CL203, mean (SD) serum total FGF23 increased from 263 (227) pg/mL at Baseline to 
215,958 (54,719) pg/mL at Week 24 of KRN23 treatment. Estimated mean (SD) serum free FGF23 increased 
from 82 (42) pg/mL at Baseline to 1359 (193) pg/mL at Week 24 of KRN23 treatment. The actual mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 102/130 
  
  
 
value could not be determined because free FGF23 levels had an upper limit of quantification of 1500 pg/mL 
and 11 (55.0%) subjects reached or exceeded this level at Week 24.  
Although there is no baseline comparator for this assay, it is expected that baseline levels should be 
approximately similar to those produced by the total FGF23 assay at baseline (as no drug is present at that 
time point). In this context, the available free FGF23 results from Week 38 and subsequent time points 
demonstrate levels consistent with an increase similar to that observed in adult XLH studies of KRN23 and 
proportionate to the increase in total FGF23. 
Study UX023-CL303 
Elevations in serum total FGF23 and free FGF23 were observed after initiation of KRN23 treatment; increased 
levels were maintained through Week 24 in the KRN23 group. In the placebo group, both total and free 
FGF23 levels in the serum remained consistent with baseline levels. Mean (SE) serum total FGF23 increased 
from 158.69 (40.971) pg/mL in the KRN23 group and 154.08 (37.879) pg/mL in the placebo group at 
baseline to 217,641.79 (14,021.354) pg/mL in the KRN23 group and 279.19 (76.027) pg/mL in the placebo 
group at Week 24. Estimated mean (SE) serum free FGF23 increased from 104.85 (23.683) pg/mL at 
baseline to 1343.32 (28.021) pg/mL in the KRN23 group at Week 24. Levels in the placebo group were 
essentially unchanged.  
Elevated serum amylase 
Both in the paediatric and adult subsets, baseline elevation in serum amylase was seen in respectively 25% 
and 4.5% of the subjects. All subjects were asymptomatic and there were no clinical signs of pancreatitis.  
In 50% of the subjects in paediatric study UX023-CL201, the serum amylase level was increased compared 
to baseline at some point during the study. Reflexive testing of amylase isoenzymes, based on an elevation 
of serum amylase levels, was conducted for seven subjects in paediatric study UX023-CL201. The salivary 
isoenzyme accounted for the majority of amylase present in all cases. 
In the adult study UX023-CL303, several subjects entered the study with modest (Grade 1: 9% or Grade 2: 
0.7%) serum amylase elevation. Overall, serum amylase levels remained consistent throughout the double-
blind period, with no meaningful differences observed between KRN23 and placebo groups. Mean (SE) serum 
amylase was 68.2 (2.77) U/L (range: 24-129) in the KRN23 group and 68.5 (3.48) U/L (range: 25-177) in 
the placebo group at baseline, and 68.4 (2.72) U/L (range: 25-139) in the KRN23 group and 67.3 (3.40) U/L 
(range: 26-169) at Week 24. 
QTc interval 
No subjects in the paediatric population (Study UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL205) had QTc intervals (with 
either Fridericia’s [QTcF] or Bazette’s [QTcB] corrections) of > 450 ms at baseline. 8 subjects in study 
UX023-CL201 had QTcF interval increases > 30 ms but ≤ 60 ms from baseline at a single visit. Two 
subjects in Study UX023-CL205 had an abnormal ECG at Week 12, but a normal assessment at Week 40. 
One subject, a 3.7 year old male, had ECG assessments that were normal at Baseline, abnormal and clinically 
insignificant at Week 12, and abnormal and potentially clinically significant at Week 40. QTcF and QTcB were 
normal (<420 msec). The Applicant has clarified that the subject’s PR-interval from 141 msec at baseline to 
179 msec at Week 40. Preliminary ECG results are available from the subject’s Week 64 visit, and show a 
normal sinus rhythm and PR duration of 163 msec. This PR interval at Week 64 was classified as normal by 
the cardiologist reading the ECG as the subject had crossed into a new age-dependent reference range.  
Across the adult studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304, 25/28 subjects had 
QTcF intervals ≤ 450 ms at baseline; all subjects ≤ 500 ms. 4 subjects had QTcF interval increases > 30 ms 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 103/130 
  
  
but ≤ 60 ms from baseline, but no subject had QTcF interval >500 ms at any time point post baseline. There 
was no tendency to increased QTcF interval during treatment.  
In adult placebo controlled study UX023-CL303, 2 subjects had QTcF interval >450 but ≤480 ms at 
baseline, all other ≤450 msec. One subject in each treatment group had a maximum QTcF interval change 
from baseline of > 30 msec at Week 24; the changes were > 30 msec and ≤ 60 msec. Both subjects had 
QTcF interval <450 msec at baseline.  
Vital signs 
Paediatric population 
Study UX023-CL201 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline or differences between treatment groups were noted in mean 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures (in mmHg and in percentile for gender, age, and height), mean heart 
rate, and the distribution of heart rate percentile category adjusted for age and gender. 
Study UX023-CL205 
Blood pressure data were available for 6 subjects from screening/baseline to week 40. Four subjects reached 
3 years of age during the study; BP data were available for these subjects from age 3 until Week 40 of the 
study. Three subjects did not reach age 3 during the study, and BP data were not obtained for these 
subjects. For the 6 subjects with pre-treatment BP data, mean (SD) SBP and DBP percentiles for sex, age, 
and height at Baseline were 78.6% (16.47%) and 64.7% (12.55%), respectively. During treatment, mean 
(SD) SBP percentiles for the 6 subjects ranged from 62.1% (15.26%) at Week 20 to 82.1% (27.24%) at 
Week 24. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were noted in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were noted in heart rate percentiles for sex and age. 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002 and UX023-CL203 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline or differences between treatment groups in mean systolic or 
diastolic blood pressure and heart rate measurements in the adult studies were evident. Of note, 60% of 
UX023-CL203 subjects had a history of hypertension. 
No trends in blood pressure or heart rate were observed; subjects were just as likely to have elevations in 
blood pressure or heart rate on three consecutive visits as they were to have decreases in these 
measurements 
Study UX023-CL303 
During the double-blind period, there were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups. 
Mean (SE) changes in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 24 were 0.1 (1.51) mmHg and 1.0 
(1.66) mmHg in the KRN23 and placebo groups, respectively; mean (SE) changes in diastolic blood pressure 
from baseline to Week 24 were 0.5 (1.10) mmHg and 1.3 (1.14) mmHg in the KRN23 and placebo groups, 
respectively. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline to Week 24 were observed for heart rate or other vital signs in 
either treatment group.

Safety in special populations 
There were 9 subjects (19.2%) aged > 50 years in the single-dose studies and 11 subjects (35.5%) in the 
adult repeat-dose studies. The age range was 21-68 years in the single-dose studies and 19-66 years in the 
adult repeat-dose studies. No studies were performed in elderly.  
There are currently no data available on the use of KRN23 in pregnant women. 
In study UX023-CL203, all subjects had creatinine values in the normal range according to Applicant. 
According to the listing in study UX023-CL201, one child with chronic kidney disease was included. The 
Applicant has provided a narrative of this subject. At baseline and at all post-baseline measurements up to 
Week 64, serum creatinine was 0.7-0.8 mg/dL (upper limit of normal 0.7 mg/dL). There are no signs of 
deterioration of renal function or nephrocalcinosis during the study. The subject remains on the study drug as 
of 01-Dec-2016. 
Immunological events 
Injections site reactions and hypersensitivity are summarized in section “Adverse events of specific interest” 
above.   
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
Immunogenicity is a potential risk with KRN23. To assess immunogenicity, blood samples were obtained for 
antibody analysis (ADA). In the first round, a question was raised by the pharmacokinetic Assessors 
regarding the validation of the method used for producing the data given below. Please refer to section 3.3.1 
Pharmacokinetics and 3.3.10 Discussion on clinical safety for further information. 
Paediatric population 
The presence of ADA was detected in four (8%) paediatric subjects at baseline in study UX023-CL201. At 
post-baseline, none of the subjects tested positive for ADA. 
In supporting Study UX023-CL205, no subjects had evidence of formation of ADA through Week 12, the last 
time point assessed so far. All samples from this study, including Week 40 samples, will be assayed using a 
new method that is capable of detecting anti-burosumab antibodies in the presence of higher concentrations 
of burosumab. Results will be presented in a separate report. 
Adult population 
Studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304 
The presence of ADA was detected in 3 adult subjects at baseline. At post-baseline, only 1 subject (in Study 
UX023-CL203) who had tested positive for ADA at baseline also tested positive post-baseline but the 
remaining two subjects did not. No adverse events associated with this finding were observed during the 
study, and laboratory data showed the expected increase in the subject’s serum phosphorus in response to 
KRN23 administration, indicating no loss of efficacy.  
Study UX023-CL303 
At baseline, ADA could be detected in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo group and 8 subjects (11.8%) in the 
KRN23 group. At Week 24, 4 subjects in the placebo group and 1 subject in the KRN23 group remained 
positive for ADA. No subjects who were negative for ADA at baseline seroconverted on treatment.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted with KRN23. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
There were no discontinuations in the paediatric studies UX023-CL201 and UX023-CL205. 
Three adult subjects discontinued the studies KRN23-INT-001/002 due to adverse events considered 
related to the study drug (injection site urticaria, restless legs, nephrolithiasis). Two of the subjects (restless 
legs, nephrolithiasis) later enrolled study UX023-CL203, and remain in the study to date. 
In study UX023-CL303, there was no discontinuation due to AEs. One subject in the KRN23 group withdrew 
consent and discontinued the study before Week 24.  
In study UX023T-CL201 (TIO/ENS), one subject discontinued the study due to progress of a mesenchymal 
tumour (please refer to “Serious adverse events and deaths” for further information). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In ongoing study UX023-CL205, 13 subjects aged 1-4 years have been included. All 13 subjects received at 
least 21 doses of burosumab (Week 40). In the other paediatric study, UX023-CL201, 52 children aged 5-
12 years were treated with Burosumab for at least 64 weeks. 
In the adult primary safety data set from study KRN23-INT001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304, 
31 subjects aged 19-66 years were treated with KRN23 for a median of 79.9 weeks at data cut-off date. 
In the only placebo-controlled study, ongoing study UX023-CL303, 134 subjects were enrolled and 
randomized 1:1 to KRN23 (68 subjects) or placebo (66 subjects). All subjects have reached at least Week 24.  
Furthermore, 15 subjects with tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) or epidermal nevus syndrome (ENT) 
(indications not included in the current application) have been treated with burosumab with a cumulative 
exposure of 6.47 patient years. 
No fatalities are reported in any of the studies, neither in children nor adults.  
All subjects in the paediatric studies reported a TEAE. Two subjects in study UX023-CL201 and one in study 
UX023-CL205 experienced grade 3 TEAEs, none of which was considered related to study treatment.  
In study UX023-CL201, one subject experienced two concurrent serious TEAEs of high fever and myalgia, 
which were considered Grade 2 in severity. The event was deemed as possibly related to study treatment. 
The patient recovered spontaneously, and study treatment was ongoing as of the data cut-off for this report, 
with no interruptions in the subsequent study dosing regimen. In study UX023-CL205, one SAE of tooth 
abscess has been reported. The event was deemed as unlikely related to study treatment, and burosumab 
treatment was not interrupted.  
The majority of TEAEs considered related to the study drug are correlated to injection site reactions. In study 
UX023-CL201, such TEAEs occurred somewhat more often in the Q2W treatment arm, as expected.  
Disturbances in vitamin D homeostasis (both decreased and increased levels) were more common in the Q4W 
than the Q2W group. One possible explanation could be that dose adjustments are easier with drug 
administrations every second week.  
The three most reported TEAEs in study UX023-CL201 were headache (65.4%), cough and nasopharyngitis, 
and in study UX023-CL205 cough, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting. Since both 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 106/130 
  
  
paediatric studies were open-label, no comparison to untreated subjects can be done.  It is noted that several 
of these, e.g. headache, cough and nasopharyngitis, are phenomena frequently occurring in a paediatric 
population. The prevalence of headache in children and adolescents is approximately 54% to 58%. It should 
however be noted that the incidence of headache was more common in the treatment group compared to 
placebo in adult study UX023-CL303, indicating a potential causal association to burosumab.  
No subjects in the paediatric studies have discontinued the study due to TEAEs. 
In the adult repeat-dose studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304, all of the 
subjects experienced a TEAE, most of whom (77%) had a TEAE of Grade 2 or less. Ten subjects reported 
TEAEs grade 2-3 that were considered related to the study drug. The majority of TEAEs considered related to 
the study drug are correlated to injection site reactions. 
Three adult subjects (10%) were discontinued from the studies KRN23-INT-001/002 by the investigator 
due to adverse events (i.e. injection site urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing nephrolithiasis, and worsening 
of pre-existing restless legs syndrome). Two of the subjects later enrolled study UX023-CL203, and remains 
in the study to date. 
In the placebo-controlled adult study UX023-CL303, the incidence of reported TEAE was comparable in the 
two groups (92.4% in the placebo group and 94.1 % in the KRN23 group). The main imbalances were found 
in two SOCs: Nervous system disorders (i.e. headache, dizziness, and RLS) (KRN23: 38.2%; placebo: 
24.2%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (KRN23: 36.8%; placebo: 45.5%). 
In adult and paediatric populations, pain in extremity, arthralgia and myalgia were common. The applicant 
suggested that this may be related to XLH, and CHMP agreed that it is difficult to differentiate between 
symptoms from the underlying disease from adverse effect regarding musculoskeletal symptoms. This is 
further supported by musculoskeletal symptoms being more common in the placebo group in study UX023-
CL303. 
In total, eleven serious adverse events were reported in the adult population, none of which was considered 
related to the therapy. Due to the time relation between the exposure and the event, confounding factors 
and/or lack of known biologic rationale/mechanism of action of study drug that could account for the event, 
this is agreed.  
In preclinical studies, the primary toxicological effects of burosumab were soft tissue and organ 
mineralization. Furthermore, in a 40 week, repeat dose study in monkeys, impaired cardiac function was 
recorded during the recovery period in males receiving high dose (30 mg/kg) burosumab. It is noted that this 
occurred in the context of supra-physiological levels of phosphate greater than 8 mg/dL. 
As opposed to the XLH-patients, preclinical studies of burosumab were conducted in wild type animals which 
do not have excess FGF23 and hence normal baseline phosphate levels and phosphate physiology.  
Burosumab treatment thus leads to prolonged and excessive antagonism of the normal regulatory actions of 
FGF23 on renal tubular phosphate resorption and vitamin D metabolism and hyperphosphataemia. This must 
be taken into consideration when extrapolating safety from preclinical data, as some of the burosumab 
effects on animals may be attributed to hyperphosphataemia. 
Classical biomarkers used clinically to assess risk for ectopic mineralisation are serum phosphate and 
calcium, urinary excretion of both phosphate and calcium, and parathyroid hormone. Although these markers 
do not have ideal test characteristics individually to predict ectopic mineralisation risk, collectively, they can 
be utilized to help assess for risk of ectopic mineralisation. Of these biomarkers, serum phosphorus is 
considered the most predictive for ectopic mineralisation risk based on an analysis of ectopic mineralisation in 
the nonclinical toxicology assessment. Supra-physiological serum phosphorus levels above 8 mg/dL (2.5 
mmol/L) were associated with ectopic mineralization in multiple species. 
In order to minimize the risk for ectopic mineralization and other adverse events, the Applicant is aiming at 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 107/130 
  
  
targeting the treatment in the low end of the normal range of serum phosphate.  
One child was reported to have a single serum phosphorus value above target range (5.2 mg/dL), but no 
subject in the paediatric population was reported to have a serum phosphorus level above the normal range 
(3.2–6.1 mg/dL). In study UX023-CL303, a total of seven (5.2%) burosumab treated subjects had a single 
serum phosphorus value above the upper limit of normal to data cut-off. 
It should however be noted that serum phosphate was measured after at least 4-8 h of fasting. Serum 
phosphate fluctuates during the day in response to dietary intake, and it cannot be excluded that post-
prandial phosphate levels may exceed the upper reference limit. The Applicant has proposed a substudy of 
both Study UX023-CL301 in children and Study UX023-CL303 in adults to evaluate postprandial serum 
phosphate in patients receiving burosumab therapy. Approximately 20 children of different ages in Study 
UX023-CL301 and approximately 25 adults in Study UX023-CL303 at US, Canadian, and/or Australian 
sites will participate in the substudy. Awaiting the study results, the issue is being addressed by advising 
prescribing physicians to periodically check the post prandial serum phosphate. 
To manage the potential contribution of increased calcium on ectopic mineralization, the maintenance of 
normal levels of calcium in the serum and urine is aimed at during the studies. 
During the studies, all subjects have been monitored with renal ultrasound and cardiac CT. The Applicant has 
proposed that recommendations for monitoring the development of nephrocalcinosis be amended to the 
SmPC.  
Two cases of ectopic mineralisation of the heart were detected at week 88 among the children 5-12 years of 
age. In one of the cases, no ectopic mineralisation could be detected at Week 112. The other subject has not 
yet reached week 112. No ectopic mineralisation of the heart was detected in the younger children. 
In the placebo-controlled adult study UX023-CL303, echocardiography reported ectopic mineralisation grade 
1 in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo group and 7 subjects (10.3%) in the KRN23 group at baseline. At Week 
24, seven subjects (10.6%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (1.5%) in the treatment group had shifted 
from grade 0 to grade 1. No subject in either group had shifted from grade 1 to a higher grade but 1 subject 
(1.5%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects in the KRN23 (4.4%) had shifted from grade 1 to grade 0. 
35% of the children in Study UX023-CL201, had signs of nephrocalcinosis at baseline renal ultrasound. 
Through Week 64, 6 subjects (12%) had an increase, and 2 subjects (3.8%) had a decrease, of 1 point in 
renal ultrasound scores. Through Week 40, no event of nephrocalcinosis was reported in Study UX023-
CL205. 
In study UX023-CL303, 59.1% of the placebo group and 50% of the KRN23 group displayed 
nephrocalcinosis at baseline. In both groups, 12 subjects (placebo 18.1%, KRN23 17.6%) had worsening 
nephrocalcinosis by 1 point and 4 subjects (placebo 6.1%, KRN23 5.9%) were improved by 1 point.  
Thus, even though there seems to be a tendency towards worsening of ectopic mineralisation over time in 
both children and adults, there was no difference between the placebo and treatment groups regarding 
nephrocalcinosis in the only placebo controlled study. There was also no trend for worsening ectopic 
mineralisation of the heart in the KRN23 group compared to placebo. So far, the anticipated problems with 
worsening ectopic mineralisation have been limited. It is however acknowledged that the length of time of 
exposure is not adequate to give full assurance over those events. The Applicant is required to address this in 
a post-authorisation study (PASS). 
The absence of information on use of Crysvita in subjects with renal failure is considered a deficiency of the 
current clinical development programme. A total of 36% subjects in the paediatric study had evidence of 
nephrocalcinosis at baseline and are at risk of developing chronic renal failure. Available data from the 
published literature suggest that nephrocalcinosis to the extent described in Study UX023-CL201 does not 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 108/130 
  
  
affect renal function, as measured by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This is accepted. Data 
on subjects with mild to moderate renal failure will be collected in the required PASS. 
Data submitted by the company give reassurance [i.e. an effect is not detected] regarding vital parameters 
(heart rate, blood pressure and ECG QTcF parameters). However, in Week 40 data from Study UX023-
CL205, one subject was reported to have a normal ECG at baseline, abnormal and clinically insignificant at 
Week 12, and abnormal and potentially clinically significant at Week 40. QTcF and QTcB were normal (<420 
ms). The Applicant has clarified that the subject’s PR-interval from 141 msec at baseline to 179 msec at 
Week 40. Preliminary ECG results are available from the subject’s Week 64 visit, and show a normal sinus 
rhythm and PR duration of 163 msec. This PR interval at Week 64 was classified as normal by the cardiologist 
reading the ECG as the subject had crossed into a new age-dependent reference range. The subject’s first 
degree AV block was assessed as not clinically significant by the Investigator and first degree AV block is 
considered as not uncommon as an incidental finding in children. The Applicant will provide updated 
information on PR interval at the next first opportunity (in either the final study report or first PSUR). This is 
considered adequate.   
Both in the paediatric and adult subsets, baseline elevation in serum amylase was seen in respectively 20.2% 
and 4.5% of the subjects. It was suggested this to be due to elevated salivary amylase, possibly related to 
the high frequency of dental issues in XLH. In seven children with elevated serum amylase levels, reflexive 
testing of amylase isoenzymes was conducted. The salivary isoenzyme accounted for the majority of amylase 
present in all cases. Furthermore, there were no meaningful differences observed between KRN23 and 
placebo groups regarding amylase levels. In the view of the CHMP these findings, in combination with all 
subjects being asymptomatic, therefore supported the view that the increase was due to elevated salivary 
amylase. 
There were 9 subjects (19.2%) aged > 50 years in the single-dose studies and 11 subjects (35.5%) in the 
adult repeat-dose studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304. The age range was 
21-68 years in the single-dose studies and 19-66 years in the adult repeat-dose studies. In the placebo-
controlled study UX023-CL303, no subject was > 65 years old.  No studies were performed in elderly.  
There are currently no data available on the use of KRN23 in pregnant women. 
In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by KRN23 treatment (almost 3000-fold 
in the paediatric study UX023-CL201, 1000-fold in Study UX023-CL205 (Week 24) and more than 800-
fold in the adult study UX023-CL203).  
The increases in FGF23 levels following KRN23 treatment were considered likely to be due to a combination 
of increased expression and reduced clearance of FGF23. FGF23 concentrations increased in parallel with 
KRN23 concentrations, suggesting that binding of FGF23 prolonged its clearance from circulation as 
compared to native FGF23. Accumulation of antibody-ligand complexes in plasma is more likely to occur with 
smaller antibody-ligand complexes containing only one or two antibodies (“sustaining antibodies”), in 
contrast with rapid clearance of a ligand with antibodies that form large, cross-linked complexes (“clearing 
antibodies”). It is also possible that there is some compensatory increased production of FGF23 due to the 
rising phosphorus levels.  
The levels of free FGF23 are also elevated compared to baseline.  
Antibodies with high affinity and bivalent binding form more stable complexes with antigens whereas those 
with moderate affinity and monovalent binding tend to form less stable complexes with antigens. The 
burosumab-FGF23 complex belongs to the second category and is likely to give rise to some free FGF23 in 
circulation. However, due to the high molar excess of burosumab, any dissociated FGF23 in circulation is 
immediately re-associated with burosumab. This results in very low, if any, free FGF23 in the circulation and 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 109/130 
  
  
reduced availability for binding to the kidney FGFR1 / klotho receptor. The choice of the specific burosumab 
antibody KRN23 was to select an intermediate binding affinity and not one with maximal affinity since this 
helps assure that FGF23 levels do not decrease to zero. The Applicant’s explanation to the elevated levels of 
total FGF23 is accepted. The company’s argument regarding the elevated levels of free FGF23 is considered 
plausible.  
Regarding long-term risks, elevated levels of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality, 
especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the UX023-CL303 study, left ventricular mass index 
was stable in 60 patients in the burosumab group in which measured total and free FGF23 increase while on 
treatment. Also in study in the UX023-CL203, no increase in left ventricular mass index was seen in 19 
subjects treated with burosumab for 48 weeks. It should be noted, however, that the observation time may 
not be enough for excluding negative effects on the heart in any of the studies. 
To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of 
FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of 
study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative 
approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.  
The relationship between PTH and FGF23 is complex, as summarized by Blau and Collins (Reviews in 
Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders June 2015, Volume 16, pp 165–174). Animal and in vitro data suggests 
that FGF23 directly inhibits PTH synthesis and secretion. On the other hand, FGF23 excess disorders such as 
TIO and XLH do not demonstrate inhibition of PTH synthesis and secretion in the setting of markedly elevated 
FGF23. Contrary, signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism can regularly be detected in XLH patients treated 
with phosphate and/or vitamin D. There are also reports on elevated PTH levels in untreated patients with 
XLH (please refer to a review by Schmitt and Mehls; Pediatric Nephrology, May 2004, Volume 19, pp 473–
477).  
The clinical relevance of elevated PTH in patients with XLH is unclear. Data of the shift graphs suggest that 
exposure to Crysvita is associated with an increase in serum [PTH].The clinical relevance of this is not yet 
fully evaluated and is required to be addressed in a post-authorisation safety study (PASS). The information 
is also reflected in the SmPC and RMP. 
In the adult primary safety dataset, two events of malignant tumours were recorded. In one subject, a 
suspect lung density, which later was diagnosed as a lung adenocarcinoma, was detected during the 
screening period, excluding the possibility of a treatment related event. In the other subject, a 55-year old 
woman, breast cancer was diagnosed on study day 270. The event was considered unlikely related to 
treatment. As breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and as the age of 55 is not 
considered unusually low for breast cancer diagnosis, a relation between the event and the treatment cannot 
be established. 
In supporting safety study UX023T-CL201 (patients with tumour induced osteomalacia [TIO]/epidermal 
nevus syndrome [ENS]), one subject developed mesenchymal tumour progression and discontinued KRN23 
treatment to receive cancer treatment. The mesenchymal tumour was the reason for inclusion in the study 
and not a de novo malignancy, and the subject had suffered from multiple episodes of tumour progression 
and metastases for almost 25 years. 
The most frequently reported related TEAE in both paediatric and adult subjects was mild injection site 
reaction (ISRs) that resolved in a few days in most cases. 
25 patients in the paediatric subset experienced hypersensitivity TEAEs, out of which 8 were deemed related 
to study treatment. Most of the events were mild/moderate, and there was no discontinuation in the 
paediatric group due to hypersensitivity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 110/130 
  
  
Three adult subjects reported hypersensitivity TEAEs that were deemed related to study drug. One of the 
three cases led to discontinuation. After the data cut-off date, a serious, life-threatening event of angioedema 
was reported. The patient was concomitantly treated with lisinopril, and after approximately four weeks after 
withdrawal of the ACE-inhibitor, treatment with KRN23 could be continued without recurrence of the 
angioedema so far.  
Hypersensitivity remains a potential risk with KRN23. 
The presence of human anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was detected in four paediatric and in three adult subjects 
at baseline. At post-baseline, none of the paediatric and one of the adult subjects tested positive for ADA. 
Exposition to KRN23 did not seem to increase the ADA positivity, and no indication of loss of efficacy was 
seen. The Applicant has since the MAA filing developed a new acid dissociation method. The applicant will 
retest all available samples from the clinical studies using this new validated method. The Applicant will 
provide updated information in the following PSUR updates.  
No additional safety data is required in the context of this conditional marketing authorisation application. 
However, long term safety will be assessed through a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) in Children 
with X-linked Hypophosphatemia.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of KRN23 is considered acceptable.  
No fatalities were seen with the medicinal product so far, and the number of discontinuations due to AEs was 
low. The number of reported TEAEs in the only placebo-controlled study was comparable between the 
placebo-group and the treatment group. The number of TEAEs in the SOC Nervous system (principally 
headache, dizziness, and RLS) disorders was higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group. 
Headache was also the most frequently reported TEAE among children 5-12 years. The most frequently 
reported related TEAE in both paediatric and adult subjects was mild injection site reaction (ISRs) that 
resolved in a few days in most cases.  
The anticipated potential risk of ectopic mineralization has been of limited concern based on available data, 
but needs further monitoring by routine pharmacovigilance and is being further addressed in a PASS. There 
were no adverse events or loss of efficacy associated anti-drug antibodies so far, but the potential issue of 
immunogenicity and development of neutralizing antibodies remains. 
The levels of total and free FGF23 were markedly increased in both paediatric and adult populations. So far, 
there are no indications that the elevated levels of free FGF23 have any biological activity. There are also 
indications in the literature linking elevated levels of FG23 to both carcinogenesis and cardiovascular 
mortality. Long term effects of elevated levels of circulating FGF23 cannot yet be evaluated. 
The CHMP considers that no measures are necessary to address any missing safety data in the context of a 
conditional MA. However, long term safety will be assessed through a PASS in Children with X-linked 
Hypophosphatemia as reported in the RMP.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 dated 12 December 2017 is 
acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that burosumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers burosumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the vial label in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 63(1) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD 
Group for the following reasons: 
Crysvita is an orphan medicinal product and will be supplied to and used exclusively by healthcare 
professionals. According to the figures provided by the company, by December 2019, the predicted 
volumes/month/country of the 20 mg vial will range from 15/month in Finland to 241/month in Germany. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 116/130 
  
  
The Group considered that the invented name, strength, INN, pharmaceutical form, lot number and expiry 
date were easily understood by a non-English speaker.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials 
will only be translated in the language as agreed by the QRD Group. 
A request to omit certain particulars from the outer carton as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Crysvita is an orphan medicinal product and will be supplied to and used exclusively by healthcare 
professionals.  
The Applicant requested to have cartons bearing only partial labelling particulars as set out in Article 54 of 
the Directive, as follow: 
- To use the short term ‘injection’ for the pharmaceutical form 
- Excipients listed in English only 
- Omission of the standard statement related to the excipient with a known effect listed: ‘For further 
information, please see the package leaflet.’ 
Two cartons will be made available, one in English/French/German and the other in Italian/ Spanish/ 
Portuguese to enable as many health professionals as possible to have the storage and administration 
information in a language they understand. It was found that the particulars being omitted or not translated 
will not influence the safe use of the product. 
The dimensions of the carton are 38 x 28 x 68 mm and it is not possible to include the full particulars 
described in Article 54 in more than one language without compromising the readability of the carton, which 
would not then fulfil the requirements of Article 56 of the Directive. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the above QRD Group decision, will appear in the Annexes published with 
the EPAR on EMA’s website, together with their corresponding translation; these particulars will be grey-
shaded to reflect the fact that they will not be displayed on the actual printed materials. 
A request of translation exemption of the package leaflet in accordance with Article 63(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the 
following reasons: 
The Group rejected the EN only package leaflet as it was considered essential for a number of QRD members 
to be available in the national language. The Group would only accept two tri-lingual package leaflets (and 
not one single package leaflet with 6 languages) in case the company could ensure distribution of the 
package leaflet in each national language, without the latter being at the expense of healthcare professionals 
or patients (e.g. it would not be acceptable to request pharmacists to print it in the national language).  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Crysvita (burosumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 117/130 
  
  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit risk assessment  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initial indication claimed by the Applicant was: Treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) in 
children over 1 year of age and adults.  
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare, chronically debilitating and deforming bone disease. XLH is 
characterized by excess levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to increased urinary 
phosphate excretion, reduced 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, and subsequent hypophosphataemia. The features of 
the disorder can vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals 
may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms. In children, the main clinical 
consequences of the disease are rickets, lower extremity skeletal deformities, gait abnormalities and loss of 
growth potential. In adulthood, the disease is associated with osteomalacia, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness 
and dental abscesses. 
Burosumab (KRN23) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the excess 
biological activity of FGF23. The aim of the therapy is to minimise the clinical consequences of the disease by 
restoring normal serum phosphorus levels. 
KRN23 has received orphan designation and the applicant is applying for a conditional marketing 
authorisation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no approved or available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated 
FGF23-induced hypophosphataemia in XLH. Most children with XLH receive conventional therapy consisting of 
multiple daily doses of oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues. In the literature, there are reports 
that oral phosphate and active vitamin D treatment during growth partially corrects leg deformities, 
decreases the number of necessary surgeries, and improves adult height; however, the evidence is scarce 
and the degree of rickets improvement with oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy has not been assessed. 
In a survey by the Applicant including 71 affected children on conventional treatment, the disease was still 
associated with short stature (typically below the 25th percentile for boys and below the 50th percentile for 
girls), bone or joint pain, bowing of the legs, intoeing caused by torsion of the tibia, knock-knees, and 
craniosynostosis. Skeletal abnormalities in children with XLH may require surgical correction.  
There is no consensus regarding treatment of adult patients because of concern about safety issues and lack 
of clinical studies demonstrating efficacy with conventional therapy.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Conventional therapy was not allowed in any of the currently submitted studies. 
Paediatric studies: 
UX023-CL201 is an Open-Label Phase 2 Study that compared FGF23 in 52 paediatric patients 5-12 years with 
XLH. The participants were randomised to different start doses and dose regimes Q2 or Q4. The dose was 
titrated according to serum phosphorus levels in both groups. There was no placebo-control group. After 
week 40, all participants received treatment Q2, which is the proposed dosing schedule. 
Results from the study are available up to week 64. The primary clinical efficacy endpoint was change in 
rickets severity as measured by Rickets Severity Score (RSS) assessed in knee and hand/wrist radiographs. 
The central independent single rater was blinded. 
The Applicant has also presented a historical cohort study in a paediatric population (n=52) on conventional 
therapy, study UXO23-CL002. Baseline age and disease severity matched with subjects in study UX023-
CL201. Results from this study were used to put the treatment response observed in subjects treated with 
KRN23 into the context of the disease and the existing treatment (i.e., conventional therapy with oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D). 
Study UX023-CL205 is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old with XLH 
who are naïve to therapy or have previously received conventional therapy with oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D to assess the safety, PD, PK, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 64 weeks. The current analysis includes data from 13 subjects through 
week 40. 
Studies in adults: 
During the procedure the applicant has withdrawn the initial request for including the adult population in the 
indication.  
Study UX023-CL303 is an ongoing randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 120 adult 
XLH patients. Safety data from the UX023-CL303 Week 24 CSR has been assessed in this AR. 
The pharmacokinetics and PK/PD relationships in the paediatric population have been evaluated with a 
population modelling analyses in combination with adult data.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Paediatric studies: 
The method of administration (subcutaneously every 2 weeks) is a potential general advantage compared to 
conventional supplementation therapy with large doses of oral phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D, 3-5 times daily. 
In study UX023-CL201, all included 52 subjects completed week 40. This supports a good tolerability of the 
drug as well as a patient/caregiver preference to the experimental therapy compared to the conventional 
therapy they had received before the study. 
The numbers for most clinical efficacy variables indicated better outcomes in the Q2W group and a generally 
more pronounced effect was seen in the severe RSS subgroup.

EMA/148319/2018 
Page 119/130 
  
  
Laboratory parameters 
Serum phosphorus levels increased from baseline to targeted low normal range in Q2W group (p<0.0001). 
More steady phosphate profile was achieved with Q2W than Q4W. Increases in 1,25(OH)2D and TmP/GFR 
(p<0.05 at each study visit) were noted. Mean (SD) serum ALP levels decreased to 369 (76) U/L at Week 64 
(-20%, p < 0.0001); decreases were similar in the two dose groups. Mean (SD) serum BALP levels decreased 
to 115 (31) μg/L at Week 64 (mean change: -29%). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a biochemical marker for 
rickets that is commonly used to monitor response to conventional therapy in children with XLH (Carpenter et 
al. 2011).  
Primary skeletal radiological endpoints  
In study UX023-CL201 overall, the rickets severity RSS total score was reduced 50% from baseline to Week 
41, from 1.80 to 0.90; p<0.0001. In the Q2W group, the reduction was 61% (p=0.0001). Radiographic 
global impression of change RGI-C wrist, knee and global score increased (p<0.0001) in both Q2 and Q4 
groups at Week 40. All patients received treatment Q2 after 40 weeks. The now available data week 64 
indicates similar effect size than the previously submitted week 40 data with mean RSS of 0.88. 
In a comparison with a historical cohort (study UX023-CL002, children with conventional therapy), a larger 
correction of rachitic abnormalities measured by RSS (38% vs 12%) and RGI-C (+1.38 vs +0.79) was seen 
in patients who received KRN23 in study UX023-CL201. RSS total score improved most in the Q2W subgroup 
and was comparable in Q4W and conventional historical treatment group at week 40. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Paediatric studies: 
The sample size is limited and no control group without active treatment KRN23 was included in the main 
paediatric study in children 5-12 years. Study UX023-CL201 (phase 2, dose finding study) is speaking in 
favor of a pharmacological effect (i.e. increase in s-phosphate, decrease in ALP) in this age group but the 
results on radiological and clinical endpoints are less convincing. Comparisons of (paediatric) open-label 
study results with external historical controls on conventional therapy should always be interpreted with 
caution. 
In the study UX023-CL205, Week 40 data (PK, PD and safety) for all 13 enrolled patients age 1 to 4 years old 
had become available during the procedure. The pharmacodynamics results, RSS and RGI-C indicate similar 
response to that seen in children 5-12 years and the CHMP considers that efficacy results from age group 5-
12 years can be extrapolated to ages 1 to 4 years old. In this study, length/standing height, expressed both 
as a percentile for age and gender and as Z scores, tended to decrease instead of (as would be expected) 
increase. The final study results at 64 weeks will be provided as part of a post authorisation commitment 
(specific obligation). 
Although phase II studies have recruited subjects aged 1 to 12yrs, it is appreciated that those at the upper 
end of the age range encompass the age of 14yrs (the company states that 9 subjects reached 14yrs). A 
positive benefit/risk balance has not been shown in adults (application for this indication was withdrawn by 
the applicant during the procedure) or in adolescents with mature skeletons (not included in studies). The 
reasoned extrapolation to adolescents with growing skeletons without a strict upper age limit is based on 
shared mechanism of action and aim of therapy and improved x-ray appearance of affected growing bones 
after longer term exposure to burosumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 120/130 
  
  
Only children with radiological evidence of bone disease have been included in the clinical studies so far and 
the indication wording is reflecting this accordingly. 
The RSS scoring methodology has previously been used for the assessment of the severity of nutritional 
rickets. There is no golden standard method of scoring radiological changes in XLH. The Applicant has used 
RSS scale in study UX023-CL201 and for historical controls in UX023-CL002.  
In study UX023-CL201, a borderline increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year from 
baseline to week 64 as well as improvement in standing height Z score +0.15 (p<0.0001). The mean 
improvement in 6MWT was +47 m overall (p<0.001) and +77 m in those with <80% predicted at baseline 
(p<0.0001). The magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients with 
the current study design regarding variables growth, 6 MWT, functional disability and pain. A biological 
variation and maturation with age has not been established for this group of subjects. Therefore, no claims 
on these parameters were included in the SmPC 5.1, pending final results from the confirmatory randomized 
phase 3 study due in 2019 (EU RMP category 2 study UX023-CL301as specific obligation of marketing 
authorization). 
A number of interim analyses were performed at various time-points in study UX023-CL201. They were 
descriptive in nature but have seemingly had an impact on study conduct and planned analyses (increased 
sample size, revised inclusion criteria, cut-off for RSS subgroup analyses). The study protocol was amended 5 
times. In addition, results from this study have seemingly been presented at medical conferences (i.e. before 
data cut-off for the current analyses) and eventually also been published. There were therefore some 
concerns regarding the dissemination of results, their potential impact on the credibility of the study results 
that follow and potential impact on study integrity; however, it was considered unlikely to change 
significantly the conclusions from the studies. 
Change in the RSS scale was the primary radiological endpoint of the study. This scale was developed for 
nutritional rickets and not for XLH. A single rater (inventor of the scale) did all RSS assessments in the study. 
During the procedure, the images have been re-rated by 2 other independent raters on request of the CHMP 
and results based on these assessments are supportive for treatment effect in these parameters. 
Long-term efficacy beyond 64 weeks of KRN23 is unknown. 
The proposed posology in the SmPC is not in line with the posology used in the main paediatric study UX023-
CL201 (that was also a dose finding study, starting from doses as low as 0.1mg/kg) but the proposed 
starting dose reflects the therapeutic dose level (0.8mg/kg Q2W) in study UX023-CL201. Thereafter, 
individual titration is needed for achieving low normal phosphate levels and this should be performed 
according to the phosphate levels as stated in the SmPC. This dosing strategy has also been implemented in 
paediatric study UX023-CL205 through 24 weeks using a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. From a safety 
point of view, a starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg is now being advised in the SmPC at this time as this was the 
lowest maintenance dose in study UX023-CL201. The dose is proposed to be titrated stepwise every four 
weeks with 0.4 mg/kg; i.e dose of 0.8 mg/kg is achieved already after four weeks of treatment. This rather 
conservative approach to dose titration may change after additional safety results from from the confirmatory 
randomized phase 3 study are being received in 2019 (EU RMP category 2 study UX023-CL301as specific 
obligation of marketing authorization).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All children experienced at least one TEAE. The most common TEAEs among the older children were 
headache (65.4%), cough, nasopharyngitis, pain in extremity, vomiting, injection site reaction and upper 
respiratory tract infection, and for the younger children cough (76.9%), pyrexia, vomiting, upper respiratory 
tract infection, pharyngitis streptococcal and rhinorrhoea. 
In the placebo-controlled adult study, safety data of which were assessed in the context of this procedure, 
the incidence of reported TEAE was comparable in the two groups (92.4% in the placebo group and 94.1% in 
the burosumab group). The main imbalances were found in two SOCs: Nervous system disorders (i.e. 
headache, dizziness, and RLS) (KRN23: 38.2%; placebo: 24.2%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (KRN23: 36.8%; placebo: 45.5%). The incidence of related TEAEs was somewhat higher (44.1%) 
in the burosumab group than in the placebo group (39.4%). 
Among children, 65.4% aged 5-12 and 23.1% aged 1-4 reported an injection site reaction (ISR). 
In the placebo controlled adult study, ISRs were reported by 12.1% of the subjects in the placebo group and 
11.8% in the burosumab group up to week 24. In the adult open label studies, the subject incidence of ISRs 
was 35%. 
23 subjects (44.2%) with hypersensitivity were recorded among the children aged 5-12 and 4 (30.8%) 
among the younger children. In 8 subjects 5-12 year (15.4%), the event was considered at least possibly 
related to treatment; among the younger children none. Three adult subjects in the open label studies 
(9.7%) reported events that were deemed related to study drug, whereof one subject experienced a Grade 2 
injection site urticaria that led to discontinuation from the study. In the placebo controlled study, a total of 
seven (5.2%) subjects treated with KRN23 (combined double-blind and open-label periods) experienced a 
KRN23-emergent hypersensitivity reaction.  
11.8% of the subjects in the burosumab group and 7.6% in the placebo group had a TEAE of restless legs 
(RLS) or limb discomfort. All RLS events were mild or moderate in severity and most were considered related 
to study drug. No paediatric subject has reported an event of RLS. 
One subject (1.9%) in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 (5-12 years) experienced two concurrent serious 
TEAEs (SAEs) (high fever and myalgia leading to hospitalization), possibly reflecting a hypersensitivity 
reaction.  The event was deemed as possibly related to study treatment. However, the events resolved and 
did not recur despite continued treatment with study medication. One SAE of tooth abscess has been 
reported. The event was deemed as unlikely related to study treatment, and burosumab treatment was not 
interrupted. Across the adult studies, 11 subjects reported SAEs, none of which were considered related to 
treatment. 
Three adult subjects (9.7%) discontinued from the studies KRN23-INT-001/002 due to adverse events. Two 
of the subjects later enrolled in study UX023-CL203, and remain in the study to date. In the placebo-
controlled study, and in the two paediatric studies, no subject has discontinued study due to AEs.  
No death was reported in any of the studies.  
Hyperphosphataemia is an anticipated adverse event of burosumab based on the mechanism of the drug. 
One child was reported to have a single serum phosphorus value above target range (5.2 mg/dL), but no 
subject in the paediatric population was reported to have a serum phosphorus level above the normal range 
(3.2–6.1 mg/dL). In the placebo controlled adult study, a total of seven (5.2%) burosumab treated subjects 
had a single serum phosphorus value above the upper limit of normal to data cut-off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 122/130 
  
  
In children 5-12 years, ectopic mineralization (EM) of the heart was Grade 0 for all 52 subjects at Baseline 
and for all post-baseline assessments except for EM Grade 1/8 for two subjects at Week 88. One of these 
subjects had returned to EM Grade 0 at Week 112, and the other had no further assessments as of the data 
cut off. In children 1-4 years, no event of EM has been reported up to Week 40.  
In the placebo-controlled adult study, EM of the heart was detected in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo group 
and 7 subjects (10.3%) in the burosumab group at baseline. At Week 24, seven subjects (10.6%) in the 
placebo group and 1 subject (1.5%) had shifted from grade 0 to grade 1. 1 subject (1.5%) in the placebo 
group and 3 subjects in the KRN23 (4.4%) had shifted from grade 1 to grade 0. 
35% of the children 5-12 years had signs of nephrocalcinosis at baseline renal ultrasound. Through Week 64, 
6 subjects (12%) had a worsening and 2 subjects had an augmentation of the renal ultrasound scores. No 
case of nephrocalcinosis has been reported in children 1-4 years up to week 40. 
In the placebo controlled adult study, 59.1% of the placebo group and 50% of the KRN23 group displayed 
nephrocalcinosis at baseline. In both groups, 12 subjects (placebo 18.1%, KRN23 17.6%) had worsening 
nephrocalcinosis and 4 subjects (placebo 6.1%, KRN23 5.9%) were improved. 
Among the younger children, no EM or nephrocalcinosis have been reported at data cut-off.  
In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by burosumab treatment (almost 
3000-fold in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 and more than 800-fold in the adult study UX023-CL203). 
This is considered to be a result of both increased expression and reduced clearance of FGF23 (“sustaining 
antibodies”). Moreover, in both the adult study and children 1-4 years, the levels of free FGF23 were elevated 
10-20-fold compared to baseline. In children 5-12 years, free FGF23 was not collected until Week 38. It is 
plausible that the elevated levels of free FGF-23 are caused by an in vitro artefact. The feasibility of 
measuring serum [free FGF23] without artefact, for example by use of equilibrium dialysis prior to 
measurement, is foreseen to be investigated by the MAH post approval. 
Data of the shift graphs suggest that exposure to burosumab is associated with an increase in serum PTH. 
Two subjects 5-12 years had serum iPTH concentrations >2 x upper level of normal (ULN) at Screening or 
Baseline visits. Both subjects showed decreases in serum iPTH concentration over time. All subjects in the 
study but four had a maximum PTH value higher than baseline, but there was no consistent rise in PTH levels 
over time. In the adult placebo controlled study, the mean serum iPTH concentration was above the ULN (> 
72 pg/mL) in both treatment groups at baseline. As in children, there was no consistent rise in PTH levels 
over time. At week 24, there was a trend to lower PTH in the treatment group.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
At this time point, there are no results available from placebo-controlled (or conservative treatment 
controlled) studies in children. Without these data, it is very difficult to distinguish any adverse events from 
the symptoms of the underlying disease or other events naturally occurring in XLH population. However, 
interim data from the double blind phase (up to week 24) of the placebo controlled adult study UX02-CL303 
are available.  
Hyperphosphataemia is an anticipated unfavourable effect of Crysvita due to the mechanism of action of the 
product. The serum phosphate was closely monitored in the clinical studies and this will be needed also in 
clinical practice. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
So far, only a limited number of events of hyperphosphataemia have been reported. However, serum 
phosphate was regularly determined in fasting subjects throughout the studies. Serum phosphate fluctuates 
during the day in response to dietary intake, and it cannot be excluded that post-prandial phosphate levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/148319/2018 
Page 123/130 
  
  
may exceed the upper reference limit. The Applicant has proposed a substudy of both Study UX023-CL301 
in children and Study UX023-CL303 in adults to evaluate postprandial serum phosphate in patients 
receiving burosumab therapy. Approximately 20 children of different ages in Study UX023-CL301 and 
approximately 25 adults in Study UX023-CL303 at US, Canadian, and/or Australian sites will participate in 
the substudy. Awaiting the study results, the issue is being addressed in the SmPC by advising prescribing 
physicians to periodically check the post prandial serum phosphate. 
Ectopic mineralization is listed as a potential risk, possibly associated with hyperphosphataemia. During the 
studies, all subjects have been monitored with renal ultrasound and cardiac CT. Worsening of ectopic 
mineralisation seems to be a limited problem so far. However, the number of subjects treated and the 
observational time are still limited. The company has proposed a post-authorisation safety study (PASS), 
which was accepted as part of the RMP, evaluating the long term safety of the product, including ectopic 
mineralisation. Recommendations for monitoring of nephrocalcinosis are included in the SmPC.  
Subjects with nephrocalcinosis may be at risk of developing chronic renal failure. The absence of information 
on use of Crysvita in subjects with renal failure is considered a deficiency of the current clinical development 
programme. The company has proposed that data on subjects with mild to moderate renal failure will be 
collected in the required PASS (category 3 study of the RMP). 
Of initial concern was the relevance of elevated serum levels of free FGF23. As burosumab is an antibody of 
moderate affinity and monovalent binding, the burosumab-FGF23 complex is less stable and is likely to give 
rise to some free FGF23 in circulation. However, due to the high molar excess of burosumab, any dissociated 
FGF23 in circulation is immediately re-associated with burosumab. This therefore is likely to result in very 
low, if any, free FGF23 in the circulation and reduced availability for binding to its downstream receptor  
Moreover, members of the FGF-family have, for example, been linked to carcinogenesis, and elevated levels 
of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality, especially in patients with chronic kidney 
disease. The observation time may not be enough for excluding negative effects of long term effects of 
elevated levels of free FGF23.  
To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of 
FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of 
study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative 
approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.  
In Week 40 data from Study UX023-CL205, one subject was reported to have a normal ECG at baseline, 
abnormal and clinically insignificant at Week 12, and abnormal and potentially clinically significant at Week 
40 (first degree AV block). QTcF and QTcB were normal (<420 ms). The subject’s first degree AV block was 
assessed as not clinically significant by the Investigator and the Applicant agrees with this assessment as first 
degree AV block is not uncommonly reported as an incidental finding in children. The Applicant will provide 
further information in either the final study report or first PSUR, whichever comes first. This is considered 
adequate.   
The clinical relevance of elevated PTH in patients with XLH is unclear. This will be addressed in the required 
PASS (category 3 study of the RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Low serum phosphate is the main laboratory abnormality of XLH. The paediatric study has demonstrated an 
increase in serum phosphate and TmP/GFR in treated subjects, with a more stable profile over time with Q2 
dosing compared to Q4. A tendency to superior clinical outcomes supports the Q2 dosing. The radiographic 
evaluation in XLH are considered as a clinically relevant outcome, however, the validation of these scores in 
XLH is not complete. Statistically significant improvements from baseline do not necessarily mean clinical 
relevance. Furthermore, it is not easy to estimate the magnitude of efficacy in the paediatric study UX023-
CL201 as all patients received the experimental treatment and with 64 weeks available data.  However, the 
effect on serum phosphate levels are further supportive of a benefit of the treatment. 
The current paediatric studies have included only children with radiographic evidence of bone disease and 
ongoing studies have stepwise been changed towards including only more severely affected patients. Very 
mildly affected individuals with XLH may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms 
throughout the life. Consequentially, the agreed wording in the indication restricts the intended use to X-
linked hypophosphataemia with radiographic evidence of bone disease. 
Injection site reactions were mostly mild in severity and nearly all resolved within 3 days. In the placebo 
controlled adult study, adverse events in the SOC Nervous system disorders (i.e. headache, dizziness, and 
RLS) were more common in the burosumab group. There were no treatment discontinuations in the 
paediatric studies. In the adult studies, 3 subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events; however, 
two of those resumed treatment. 
It is considered crucial to avoid hyperphosphataemia, as high serum phosphate is linked to the development 
of ectopic mineralisation and is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. So far, 
hyperphosphataemia has been a limited problem, but it remains a concern that there is no data on serum 
phosphate levels in a non-fasting state. The company has committed to initiate a study on this issue. During 
the clinical studies, serum phosphate has been targeted in the lower end of the age-adjusted reference 
range. A similar advice is included in the SmPC, together with recommendations on how to monitor serum 
phosphate.  
Ectopic mineralisation of the heart and/or kidney is considered an important potential safety risk. This has 
been of limited concern based on available data, but the time of exposure is not adequate to give full 
assurance regarding those events. Recommendation on monitoring nephrocalcinosis has been included in the 
Assessment report

SmPC, and the Applicant has proposed a long term post-authorisation safety study to address such safety 
issues. 
It is presently unknown whether there are any unfavourable long term effects of the elevated FGF23-levels. 
To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of 
FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of 
study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative 
approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.  
The Applicant has withdrawn the adult indication and requests conditional approval to be limited to the 
paediatric population.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the paediatric population 5-12 years, positive findings on serum phosphate levels in the Q2 dosing group 
were supported by at least favourable trends in all specified efficacy measures in patients with severe XLH 
rickets. In children 1-4 years, available pharmacodynamics and radiological data indicate similar response 
than for older children. Some subjects reached 14years of age during the studies. The reasoned extrapolation 
to adolescents with growing skeletons without a strict upper age limit is based on shared mechanism of 
action and aim of therapy as well as improved x-ray appearance seen in affected growing bones after longer 
term exposure.  
Potential safety concerns have been identified, mainly hyperphosphataemia, ectopic mineralisation and 
elevated levels of free and total FGF23, but so far, these anticipated issues have been of limited concern 
based on available data. No unexpected adverse events have emerged. There were no deaths in any of the 
studies.  
Data submitted for this application included two phase 2 studies in the paediatric population, which showed 
an improvement with burosumab of relevant metabolic parameters, including serum phosphate levels, of 
radiological endpoints related to the severity of rickets, and and clinical endpoints relevant for XLH. However, 
the the sample size and length of studies were limited. Furthermore, no control group without active 
treatment was included and therefore the comparison of such (paediatric) open-label study results with 
external historical controls on conventional therapy did not allow a fully comprehensive assessment of safety 
and efficacy. 
As this is an orphan product intended for the treatment of a seriously debilitating disease (leading to 
defective bone mineralisation that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia with subsequent bowing of the leg, 
physical disability, and decreased height, and is also associated with pain, stiffness, fatigue, and functional 
limitations) the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation, and agreed that the applicant should complete the following studies as specific obligations for 
such a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (see also clinical efficacy section for more details on these 
studies): 
UX023-CL201: A Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Finding, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics 
and Safety of the Anti-FGF23 Antibody, KRN23, in Paediatric Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
UX023-CL205: An Open-Label, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of 
KRN23 in Children from 1 to 4 Years old with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH)

UX023-CL301: A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of KRN23 Versus 
Oral Phosphate and Active Vitamin D Treatment in Paediatric Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH)  
All 3 studies had completed recruitment already at time of submission of this procedure, and were well 
advanced. Therefore it is likely that comprehensive data can be provided in the pre-specified timeframe. 
 Study UX023-CL301 is a randomized controlled phase 3 study, includes relevant efficacy outcome 
parameters, and is expected to confirm the positive benefit/risk profile observed in the phase 2 studies; this 
study has also shown a high degree of adherence to study treatment. The data from all 3 studies are planned 
to be submitted in or before 2020. 
In summary, treatment of XLH with burosumab reduces the loss of phosphate from the kidney, improves 
abnormally low serum phosphate concentrations and other metabolic changes, and reduces the severity of 
rickets as shown in x-rays. Also, treatment with burosumab was not associated with major safety concerns. 
No other specific and fully satisfactory treatment options for XLH are available. Therefore, while fully 
comprehensive data is not yet available, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh 
the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Crysvita for conditional approval for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia with 
radiographic evidence of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing 
skeletons is positive.

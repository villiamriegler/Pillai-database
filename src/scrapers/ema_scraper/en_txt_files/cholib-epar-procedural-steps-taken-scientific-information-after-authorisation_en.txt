Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to amend 
the interaction between the fixed combination 
updated in the section 4.4. of the SmPC and new data on 
the existing warning on immune-mediated 
necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) and section 4.5 of the 
SmPC to add drug-drug interaction information with 
cobicistat, following the update of the company's 
core data sheet (CCDS) due to new data. Section 
4.3. of the SmPC was consequently amended, also to 
include the necessary cross-references. Section 4.8 
of the SmPC was also amended to add immune-
mediated necrotizing myopathy with a rare 
frequency. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list the UK (Northern 
Ireland) local representative in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

of the SmPC.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Cholib 
PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
The product information concerning simvastatin has been

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for dasabuvir, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on one plausible, unconfounded, spontaneous report of angioedema, one possible case from 
clinical trials using a regimen of three direct-acting antiviral agent (3-DAA), in which the patient 
complained about left mouth and lip swelling, three additional reports retrieved from Eudravigilance 
(using angioedema as Standard MedDRA Queries) where one of the cases presented a temporal 
plausible association and a positive dechallenge and given the potential severity of angioedema, the 
PRAC considered that there is sufficient evidence to include angioedema in section 4.8 of the summary 
of product characteristics with a frequency rare. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing dasabuvir were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dasabuvir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dasabuvir is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

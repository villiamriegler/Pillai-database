Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  roxadustat,  the  scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of  available data on  Secondary Hypothyroidism from clinical trial(s),  the  literature, spontaneous 
reports including  in  some  cases a close  temporal relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge and  in  view  of  a 
plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  roxadustat  and 
Secondary  Hypothyroidism  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product 
information of products containing roxadustat should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the  basis of the  scientific conclusions for roxadustat the  CHMP  is of the opinion that  the  benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing roxadustat is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one capsule of Urorec 8 mg daily. For special patient populations, one 
capsule of Urorec 4 mg daily is recommended (see below). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (CLCR ≥ 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min).  
A starting dose of 4 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CLCR ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min), which may be increased to 8 mg once daily after one week of treatment, 
depending on the individual patient’s response. The use in patients with severe renal impairment 
(CLCR < 30 mL/min) is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  
As no data are available, the use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Urorec in the paediatric population for the indication of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH). 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
The capsule should be taken with food, preferably at the same time every day. The capsule should not 
be broken or chewed but swallowed whole, preferably with a glass of water. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) 
IFIS (a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on 
α1-blockers or previously treated with α1-blockers. This may lead to increased procedural 
complications during the operation.  
The initiation of therapy with silodosin is not recommended in patients for whom cataract surgery is 
scheduled. Discontinuing treatment with an α1-blocker 1-2 weeks prior to cataract surgery has been 
recommended, but the benefit and duration of stopping the therapy prior to cataract surgery has not yet 
been established.  
During pre-operative assessment, eye surgeons and ophthalmic teams should consider whether patients 
scheduled for cataract surgery are being or have been treated with silodosin, in order to ensure that 
appropriate measures will be in place to manage IFIS during surgery.  
Orthostatic effects 
The incidence of orthostatic effects with silodosin is very low. However, a reduction in blood pressure 
can occur in individual patients, leading in rare cases to syncope. At the first signs of orthostatic 
hypotension (such as postural dizziness), the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have 
disappeared. In patients with orthostatic hypotension, treatment with silodosin is not recommended. 
Renal impairment  
The use of silodosin in patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 ml/min) is not recommended 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
Since no data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of silodosin in these 
patients is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Carcinoma of the prostate 
Since BPH and prostate carcinoma may present the same symptoms and can co-exist, patients thought 
to have BPH should be examined prior to starting therapy with silodosin, to rule out the presence of 
carcinoma of the prostate. Digital rectal examination and, when necessary, determination of prostate 
specific antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. 
Treatment with silodosin leads to a decrease in the amount of semen released during orgasm that may 
temporarily affect male fertility. This effect disappears after discontinuation of silodosin (see 
section 4.8). 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Silodosin is metabolised extensively, mainly via CYP3A4, alcohol dehydrogenase and UGT2B7. 
Silodosin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Substances that inhibit (such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir or cyclosporine) or induce (such as rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin) these enzymes and transporters may affect the plasma concentrations of silodosin and its 
active metabolite. 
Alpha-blockers 
There is inadequate information about the safe use of silodosin in association with other 
α-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Consequently, the concomitant use of other α-adrenoreceptor 
antagonists is not recommended. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In an interaction study, a 3.7-fold increase in maximum silodosin plasma concentrations and a 3.1-fold 
increase in silodosin exposure (i.e. AUC) were observed with concurrent administration of a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole 400 mg). Concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir or cyclosporine) is not recommended. 
When silodosin was co-administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor of moderate potency such as diltiazem, 
an increase in silodosin AUC of approximately 30% was observed, but Cmax and half-life were not 
affected. This change is clinically not relevant and no dose adjustment is required. 
PDE-5 inhibitors 
Minimal pharmacodynamic interactions have been observed between silodosin and maximum doses of 
sildenafil or tadalafil. In a placebo-controlled study in 24 subjects 45-78 years of age receiving 
silodosin, the co-administration of sildenafil 100 mg or tadalafil 20 mg induced no clinically 
meaningful mean decreases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, as assessed by orthostatic tests 
(standing versus supine). In the subjects over 65 years, the mean decreases at the various time points 
were between 5 and 15 mmHg (systolic) and 0 and 10 mmHg (diastolic). Positive orthostatic tests 
were only slightly more common during co-administration; however, no symptomatic orthostasis or 
dizziness occurred. Patients taking PDE-5 inhibitors concomitantly with silodosin should be monitored 
for possible adverse reactions. 
Antihypertensives 
In the clinical study program, many patients were on concomitant antihypertensive therapy (mostly 
agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and diuretics) 
without experiencing an increase in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension. Nevertheless, caution 
should be exercised when starting concomitant use with antihypertensives and patients should be 
monitored for possible adverse reactions.  
Digoxin 
Steady state levels of digoxin, a substrate of P-glycoprotein, were not significantly affected by 
co-administration with silodosin 8 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Not applicable as silodosin is intended for male patients only. 
Fertility 
In clinical studies, the occurrence of ejaculation with reduced or no semen has been observed during 
treatment with silodosin (see section 4.8), due to the pharmacodynamic properties of silodosin. Before 
starting treatment, the patient should be informed that this effect may occur, temporarily affecting 
male fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Urorec has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
informed about the possible occurrence of symptoms related to postural hypotension (such as 
dizziness) and should be cautioned about driving or operating machines until they know how silodosin 
will affect them. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of silodosin has been evaluated in four Phase II-III double-blind controlled clinical studies 
(with 931 patients receiving silodosin 8 mg once daily and 733 patients receiving placebo) and in two 
long-term open-label extension phase studies. In total, 1,581 patients have received silodosin at a dose 
of 8 mg once daily, including 961 patients exposed for at least 6 months and 384 patients exposed for 
1 year. 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with silodosin in placebo controlled clinical studies and 
during long-term use were ejaculatory disorders such as retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation 
(ejaculatory volume reduced or absent), with a frequency of 23%. This may temporarily affect male 
fertility. It is reversible within a few days upon discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Floppy Iris 
Syndrome 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Orthostatic hypotension 
The incidence of orthostatic hypotension in placebo-controlled clinical studies was 1.2% with 
silodosin and 1.0% with placebo. Orthostatic hypotension may occasionally lead to syncope (see 
section 4.4). 
Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) 
IFIS has been reported during cataract surgery (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Silodosin was evaluated at doses of up to 48 mg/day in healthy male subjects. The dose-limiting 
adverse reaction was postural hypotension. If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric 
lavage may be considered. Should overdose of silodosin lead to hypotension, cardiovascular support 
has to be provided. Dialysis is unlikely to be of significant benefit since silodosin is highly (96.6%) 
protein bound.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, ATC code: G04CA04. 
Mechanism of action 
Silodosin is highly selective for α1A-adrenoreceptors that are primarily located in the human prostate, 
bladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule and prostatic urethra. Blockade of these 
α1A-adrenoreceptors causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax, thus decreasing bladder outlet 
resistance, without affecting detrusor smooth muscle contractility. This causes an improvement of both

storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms (Lower urinary tract symptoms, LUTS) 
associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Silodosin has a substantially lower affinity for the α1B-adrenoreceptors that are primarily located in the 
cardiovascular system. It has been demonstrated in vitro that the α1A:α1B binding ratio of silodosin 
(162:1) is extremely high.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a Phase II dose-finding, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with silodosin 4 or 8 mg 
once daily, a greater improvement in American Urologic Association (AUA) symptom index score 
was observed with silodosin 8 mg (-6.8 ± 5.8, n = 90; p = 0.0018) and silodosin 4 mg (-5.7 ± 5.5, 
n = 88; p = 0.0355) as compared to placebo (-4.0 ± 5.5, n = 83). 
Over 800 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH (International Prostate Symptom Score, 
IPSS, baseline value ≥13) received silodosin 8 mg once daily in two Phase III placebo-controlled 
clinical studies conducted in the United States and in one placebo- and active-controlled clinical study 
conducted in Europe. In all studies, patients who did not respond to placebo during a 4-week placebo 
run-in phase were randomised to receive the study treatment. In all studies, patients treated with 
silodosin had a greater decrease in both storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms of 
BPH as compared to placebo as assessed after 12 weeks of treatment. Data observed in the 
Intent-to-treat populations of each study are shown below:

In the active-controlled clinical study conducted in Europe, silodosin 8 mg once daily was shown to be 
non inferior to tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily: the adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in the IPSS Total 
Score between treatments in the per-protocol population was 0.4 (-0.4 to 1.1). The responder rate (i.e. 
improvement in the IPSS total score by at least 25%) was significantly higher in the silodosin (68%) 
and tamsulosin group (65%), as compared to placebo (53%). 
In the long-term open-label extension phase of these controlled studies, in which patients received 
silodosin for up to 1 year, the symptom improvement induced by silodosin at week 12 of treatment 
was maintained over 1 year. 
In a Phase IV clinical trial performed in Europe, with a mean baseline IPSS total score of 18.9 points, 
77.1%were responders to silodosin (as assessed by a change from baseline in the IPSS total score of at

least 25%). Approximately half of the patients reported an improvement in the most bothersome 
symptoms complained at baseline by the patients (i.e. nocturia, frequency, decreased stream, urgency, 
terminal dribbling and incomplete emptying), as assessed by the ICS-male questionnaire. 
No significant reduction in supine blood pressure was observed in all clinical studies conducted with 
silodosin.  
Silodosin 8 mg and 24 mg daily had no statistically significant effect on ECG intervals or cardiac 
repolarisation relative to placebo.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Urorec in all subsets of the paediatric population in BPH (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of silodosin and its main metabolites have been evaluated in adult male subjects 
with and without BPH after single and multiple administrations with doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 
48 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of silodosin is linear throughout this dose range. 
The exposure to the main metabolite in plasma, silodosin glucuronide (KMD-3213G), at steady-state 
is about 3-fold that of the parent substance. Silodosin and its glucuronide reach steady-state after 
3 days and 5 days of treatment, respectively. 
Absorption 
Silodosin administered orally is well absorbed and absorption is dose proportional. The absolute 
bioavailability is approximately 32%. 
An in vitro study with Caco-2 cells showed that silodosin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. 
Food decreases Cmax by approximately 30%, increases tmax by approximately 1 hour and has little 
effect on AUC. 
In healthy male subjects of the target age range (n = 16, mean age 55 ± 8 years) after once-a-day oral 
administration of 8 mg immediately after breakfast for 7 days, the following pharmacokinetic 
parameters were obtained: Cmax 87 ± 51 ng/mL (sd), tmax 2.5 hours (range 1.0-3.0), AUC 
433 ± 286 ng • h/mL. 
Distribution 
Silodosin has a volume of distribution of 0.81 L/kg and is 96.6% bound to plasma proteins. It does not 
distribute into blood cells. 
Protein binding of silodosin glucuronide is 91%. 
Biotransformation 
Silodosin undergoes extensive metabolism through glucuronidation (UGT2B7), alcohol and aldehyde 
dehydrogenase and oxidative pathways, mainly CYP3A4. The main metabolite in plasma, the 
glucuronide conjugate of silodosin (KMD-3213G), that has been shown to be active in vitro, has an 
extended half-life (approximately 24 hours) and reaches plasma concentrations approximately four 
times higher than those of silodosin. In vitro data indicate that silodosin does not have the potential to 
inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme systems. 
Elimination  
Following oral administration of 14C-labelled silodosin, the recovery of radioactivity after 7 days was 
approximately 33.5% in urine and 54.9% in faeces. Body clearance of silodosin was approximately 
0.28 L/h/kg. Silodosin is excreted mainly as metabolites, very low amounts of unchanged drug are 
recovered in urine. The terminal half-life of parent drug and its glucuronide is approximately 11 hours 
and 18 hours, respectively. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Exposure to silodosin and its main metabolites does not change significantly with age, even in subjects 
of age over 75 years. 
Paediatric population 
Silodosin has not been evaluated in patients less than 18 years of age. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of silodosin was not altered in nine patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9), compared to nine healthy subjects. Results 
from this study should be interpreted with caution, since enrolled patients had normal biochemistry 
values, indicating normal metabolic function, and they were classified as having moderate liver 
impairment based on ascites and hepatic encephalopathy.  
The pharmacokinetics of silodosin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. 
Renal impairment 
In a single-dose study, exposure to silodosin (unbound) in subjects with mild (n = 8) and moderate 
renal impairment (n = 8) resulted, on average, in an increase of Cmax (1.6-fold) and AUC (1.7-fold) 
relative to subjects with normal renal function (n = 8). In subjects with severe renal impairment (n = 5) 
increase of exposure was 2.2-fold for Cmax and 3.7-fold for AUC. Exposure to the main metabolites, 
silodosin glucuronide and KMD3293, was also increased. 
Plasma level monitoring in a Phase III clinical study showed that levels of total silodosin after 4 weeks 
of treatment did not change in patients with mild impairment (n = 70), compared to patients with 
normal renal function (n = 155), while the levels were doubled on average in patients with moderate 
impairment (n = 7). 
A review of safety data of patients enrolled in all clinical studies does not indicate that mild renal 
impairment (n = 487) poses an additional safety risk during silodosin therapy (such as an increase in 
dizziness or orthostatic hypotension) as compared to patients with normal renal function (n = 955). 
Accordingly, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. Since only limited 
experience exists in patients with moderate renal impairment (n = 35), a lower starting dose of 4 mg is 
recommended. In patients with severe renal impairment administration of Urorec is not recommended.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic potential. Effects in animals (affecting the 
thyroid gland in rodents) were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
In male rats, decreased fertility was observed from exposures which were approximately twice the 
exposure at the maximum recommended human dose. The observed effect was reversible.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Urorec is and what it is used for 
What Urorec is 
Urorec belongs to a group of medicines called alpha1A-adrenoreceptor blockers. 
Urorec is selective for the receptors located in the prostate, bladder and urethra. By blocking these 
receptors, it causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax. This makes it easier for you to pass water 
and relieves your symptoms. 
What Urorec is used for 
Urorec is used in adult men to treat the urinary symptoms associated with benign enlargement of the 
prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), such as: 
• 
difficulty in starting to pass water, 
• 
a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder, 
• 
a more frequent need to pass water, even at night. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Urorec 
Do not take Urorec 
if you are allergic to silodosin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Urorec 
• 
If you are undergoing eye surgery because of cloudiness of the lens (cataract surgery), it is 
important that you immediately inform your eye specialist that you are using or have previously 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used Urorec. This is because some patients treated with this kind of medicine experienced a loss 
of muscle tone in the iris (the coloured circular part of the eye) during such a surgery. The 
specialist can take appropriate precautions with respect to medicine and surgical techniques to 
be used. Ask your doctor whether or not you should postpone or temporarily stop taking Urorec 
when undergoing cataract surgery. 
If you have ever fainted or felt dizzy when suddenly standing up, please inform your doctor 
before taking Urorec.  
Dizziness when standing up and occasionally fainting may occur when taking Urorec, 
particularly when starting treatment or if you are taking other medicines that lower blood 
pressure. If this occurs, make sure you sit or lie down straight away until the symptoms have 
disappeared and inform your doctor as soon as possible (see also section “Driving and using 
machines”).  
If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Urorec, as it was not tested in this 
condition. 
If you have problems with your kidneys, please ask your doctor for advice.  
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor will start Urorec with caution and possibly 
with a lower dose (see section 3 “Dose”).  
If you have severe kidney problems, you should not take Urorec. 
Since a benign enlargement of the prostate and prostate cancer may present the same symptoms, 
your doctor will check you for prostate cancer before starting treatment with Urorec. Urorec 
does not treat prostate cancer. 
The treatment with Urorec may lead to an abnormal ejaculation (decrease in the amount of 
semen released during sex) that may temporarily affect male fertility. This effect disappears 
after discontinuation of Urorec. Please inform your doctor if you are planning to have children. 
•

• 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years since there is no relevant 
indication for this age group. 
Other medicines and Urorec 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Tell your doctor in particular, if you take: 
• 
medicines which lower blood pressure (in particular, medicines called alpha1-blockers, such 
as prazosin or doxazosin) as there may be the potential risk that the effect of these medicines is 
increased whilst taking Urorec. 
antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole or itraconazole), medicines used for HIV-AIDS 
(such as ritonavir) or medicines used after transplants to prevent organ rejection (such as 
cyclosporin) because these medicines can increase the blood concentration of Urorec. 
medicines used for treating problems in getting or keeping an erection (such as sildenafil or 
tadalafil), since the concomitant use with Urorec might lead to a slight decrease in blood 
pressure.  
medicines for epilepsy or rifampicin (a medicine to treat tubercolosis), since the effect of 
Urorec may be reduced. 
• 
• 
• 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Urorec is not intended for use by women. 
Fertility 
Urorec may reduce the amount of sperm, and so could temporarily affect your ability to father a child. 
If you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel faint, dizzy, drowsy or have blurred vision. 
3. 
How to take Urorec 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one capsule of Urorec 8 mg per day by oral administration.  
Take the capsule always with food, preferably at the same time every day. Do not break or chew the 
capsule, but swallow it whole, preferably with a glass of water. 
Patients with kidney problems  
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a different dose. For this purpose 
Urorec 4 mg hard capsules are available. 
If you take more Urorec than you should 
If you have taken more than one capsule, inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you become dizzy 
or feel weak, tell your doctor straight away. 
If you forget to take Urorec 
You may take your capsule later the same day if you have forgotten to take it earlier. If it is almost 
time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
capsule. 
If you stop taking Urorec 
If you stop treatment, your symptoms may re-appear. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following allergic reactions: swelling of the 
face or throat, difficulty in breathing, feeling faint, itchy skin or hives since the consequences could 
become serious. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common side effect is a decrease in the amount of semen released during sex. This effect 
disappears after discontinuation of Urorec. Please inform your doctor if you are planning to have 
children. 
Dizziness, including dizziness when standing up, and occasionally fainting, may occur.  
If you do feel weak or dizzy, make sure you sit or lie down straight away until the symptoms have 
disappeared. If dizziness when standing up or fainting occurs, please inform your doctor as soon as 
possible. 
Urorec may cause complications during a cataract surgery (eye surgery because of cloudiness of the 
lens, see section “Warnings and precautions”).  
It is important that you immediately inform your eye specialist if you are using or have previously 
used Urorec.

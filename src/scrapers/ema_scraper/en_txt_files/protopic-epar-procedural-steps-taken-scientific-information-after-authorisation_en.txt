1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC following results from two non-interventional 
II and PL 
authorisation safety studies were reviewed in this 
procedure: APPLES study (a prospective, non-

post-authorisation safety studies: JOELLE study 
(Joint European Longitudinal Lymphoma and skin 
cancer Evaluation, category 3) and APPLES study (a 
prospective pediatric longitudinal evaluation to 
assess the long-term safety of tacrolimus ointment 
for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, category 3). 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
is updated to version 16.0. In addition, the 
marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.1.

primary data collection evaluating the risk of malignancy in 
children aged less than 16 who had been using tacrolimus 
ointment for atopic dermatitis for at least 6 weeks) and 
JOELLE study (a large historical cohort study using 4 
population-based databases to evaluate the risk of incident 
skin cancer [composite including melanoma and NMSC] and 
lymphoma [a composite including Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL 
and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma] among new adult and 
paediatric users of topical tacrolimus ointment compared to 
new and prevalent users of moderate to high potency 
topical steroids). Based on the review of the data provided 
a link between Protopic ointment treatment and 
development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but 
definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. It is therefore 
recommended to use tacrolimus ointment at the lowest 
strength and the lowest frequency for the shortest duration 
necessary as determined by the physician’s evaluation of 
the clinical condition. Furthermore, it was agreed to not 
reflect the data in section 5.1 in line with the SmPC 
guideline, as it is considered that these studies have a 
number of important limitations. Limitations of the APPLES 
study include the potential for survivor bias, selection bias, 
and losses to follow-up, as well as comparison with an 
external comparator cohort with limited adjustment for 
confounding. Limitations of the JoELLE study include the 
potential for selection bias, protopathic bias, detection bias, 
confounding by indication, residual confounding, 
information bias, heterogeneity of findings across the study 
databases, and in children, limited power.

Following a review of post-marketing safety data the 
of the SmPC regarding the adverse events local skin 
infection, application site oedema, drug level 
increase, and folliculitis, further to a review of post-
marketing safety data. The Package Leaflet has been 
amended accordingly. In addition the MAH took the 
opportunity to make an editorial amendment in 
section 4.2. The list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet has been updated. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
following adverse events were added to the SmPC section 
4.8: 
- "local skin infection" under the System Organ Class (SOC) 
Infections and Infestations 
- "application site oedema" under the SOC General 
disorders and administration site conditions 
- "drug level increase" under the SOC Investigations. 
The term "folliculitis" was moved from SOC Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders to the primary SOC 
Infections and infestations according to MedDRA version 
13.1. As a consequence of this the text in SmPC section 4.4 
describing that treatment of Protopic may be associated 
with an increased risk of infections and infestations has 
been updated by adding the term "folliculitis". 
The text in section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions 
for use) which contains the warning to use Protopic 
ointment in patients with skin barrier defect has been 
rephrased and a sentence has been added related to the 
addition of the, above mentioned, drug level increase 
adverse event. 
To give clearer guidance how to use Protopic for short-term 
and intermittent long-term treatment in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC, the relevant sentence was moved under the sub-
heading "Posology".

amendments, and the SmPC and the PL have been

finished product - Qualitative and quantitative 
parallel group study in 2-11 years old paediatric patients 
with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (study FG-506-
06-27) demonstrated that after 5 weeks the response rate 
[95% CI], defined as the percentage of patients with a 
serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titre ? 8, was similarly 
high in the groups of hydrocortisone ointment 99% [97.3, 
100], tacrolimus ointment 98% [94.8, 100] and control 
98% [93.3, 100]. 
The results of study FG-506-06-27 show that primary 
response to vaccination study is not affected by use of 
Protopic, induction of a T-cell dependent response and 
immunological memory is present and there is no evidence 
of systemic immunosuppression in the presence of efficacy 
and safety findings which are consistent with the results of 
previous studies. There is no new clinical data with impact 
on the benefit/risk assessment of the product.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The intended indication for Pelmeg (also referred to as B12019 in this report) is “Reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes)”, ATC code L03AA13. One 6 mg dose (provided as a single prefilled syringe) of 
pegfilgrastim is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, to be administered at least 24 hours 
following cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
The Applicant claims the authorisation for Pelmeg as a similar product to Neulasta (EU) which was 
granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 22 of August 2002. The proposed indication for Pelmeg 
is the same as for the reference product Neulasta (EU). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Chemotherapy-induced  neutropenia  and  its  subsequent  infectious  complications  represent  the  most 
common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer therapy. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of 
treatment-naïve  patients  during  common  chemotherapy  regimens  depending  on  the  patient 
population;  the  dosage,  timing  and  type  of  chemotherapy  used 1.  The  severity  of  febrile  neutropenia 
depends  on  the  dose  intensity  of  the  chemotherapy  regimen,  the  patient’s  prior  history  of  either 
radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities.

2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Neutrophils contribute to both, the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection2. 
Chemotherapy regimens are associated with bone marrow suppression, resulting in reduced production 
of  neutrophils  (and  also  other  blood  cells  like  erythrocytes  and  thrombocytes).  In  clinical  practice, 
neutropenia  is  the  main  limiting  factor  for  the  applicability  of  chemotherapy3.  Both  the  duration  of 
Grade  4  neutropenia  (defined  as  absolute  neutrophil  count  [ANC]  of  <0.5  x  109/L)  and  the  depth  of 
the  nadir  after  chemotherapy  are  correlated  with  the  development  of  infectious  complications4.  The 
risk of developing febrile neutropenia (FN) is thereby driven by the chemotherapy dose and schedule, 
and patient-related factors5. 
The principal regulator of physiological granulopoiesis human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that has been 
shown to regulate the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, mediated via a 
single affinity extracellular receptor. By binding and signalling through granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor receptor (G-CSFR), G-CSF has multiple effects on circulating neutrophils and on neutrophil 
precursors in bone marrow6.  
Stimulation of precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow leads to an increase in the total mass of 
G-CSFR-expressing cells, which serves as a negative regulator of G-CSF levels through accelerated 
clearance of G-CSF 7. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a significant dose-limiting toxicity in cancer treatment and a 
major risk factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 
25% to 40% of treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the 
patient population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used1. In the clinical context, FN is 
defined as an oral temperature of >38.3°C or two consecutive readings of >38.0°C for 2 hours and an 
ANC of <0.5 x 109/L, or expected to fall below <0.5 x 109/L [Klastersky, de Naurois et al. 2016]. The 
occurrence of febrile neutropenia often necessitates chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may 
also lengthen hospital stay; increase monitoring, diagnostic, and treatment costs; and reduce patient 
quality of life.

2.1.5.  Management 
Primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors, CSFs, reduces the frequency of chemotherapy 
induced neutropenia, all-cause mortality during chemotherapy, and need for hospital care e.g. in 
breast cancer8. The administration of G-CSF can accelerate the development of neutrophils from 
committed progenitors, thereby reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of neutropenia9. Forms 
of G-CSF such as filgrastim and lenograstim including biosimilars, are administered by a course of daily 
injections, whereas pegfilgrastim allows once-per-cycle administration and may avoid suboptimal daily 
dosing.   
EORTC 2010 guidelines cover use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF, to reduce the 
incidence of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adult patients with lymphoproliferative 
disorders and solid tumours. Prophylaxis with a CSF is recommended for: 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with >20% risk of FN 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with 10% to 20% risk of FN, subject to patient specific risk 
factors such as elderly age (≥65 years) and neutrophil count 
• 
Patients with a previous episode of FN  
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduced duration of the 
neutropenic phase in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim was initially approved for 
the prevention of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid 
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The pivotal study in patients with small cell 
lung carcinoma receiving cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy demonstrated 
an approximately 50% reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of Grade 4 
neutropenia, as well as statistically significant reductions in the incidence of hospitalizations and IV 
antibiotic usage10. Subsequent indications for filgrastim included engraftment following bone marrow 
transplantation, mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and engraftment following 
transplantation, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and severe 
chronic neutropenia. Because of its relatively short half-life of 3.5 hours, filgrastim is administered 
once daily by SC administration no less than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continuing until 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within each cycle of treatment. Shortcomings of filgrastim 
include the requirement for either daily visits to the clinic or home injections by the patient during the 
period of administration, frequent ANC monitoring, the possibility of missed doses, and suboptimal 
duration of treatment (either too short or too long). Efforts to overcome these limitations led to the 
PEGylation of the G-CSF protein. The subsequent PEGylation of the G-CSF protein filgrastim altered the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, resulting in slower clearance and a prolonged half-life (between 15 and 
80 hours), thus permitting a single injection per cycle of chemotherapy11. Pegylation of filgrastim 
increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for renal clearance. Due to its high 
molecular weight, pegfilgrastim exhibits limited transport into the blood capillaries after SC 
administration and enters the systemic circulation via an indirect route, through the lymphatics.

With a long half-life and target-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until the 
bone marrow neutrophil precursors start to come back after chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 
was first authorized for marketing in the EU and US in 2002. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Filgrastim  is  a  human  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  manufactured  via  recombinant 
technology,  resulting  in  recombinant  human  N-methionyl  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (rHU-
Met-G-CSF) of 175 amino acids with a molecular weight of 18,800 Da. 
rHU-Met-G-CSF  is  produced  by  Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli)  bacteria  and  subsequently  PEGylated  by  the 
conjugation  of  a  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)  moiety  to  the  primary  amino  group  at  the  N-terminus  of 
filgrastim  to  increase  the  exposure  duration  and  therapeutic  activity  of  the  protein  due  to  decreased 
renal clearance. 
Pelmeg  is  developed  as  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product  with  Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)  as  the 
Reference  Medicinal  Product.  Pegfilgrastim  is  a  PEGylated  (polyethylene  glycol  polymer  chain),  long-
acting  form  of  human  recombinant  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF;  filgrastim). 
Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pelmeg, is expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and has an identical 
amino acid sequence as natural human G-CSF, except for an additional N-terminal methionine residue 
for the expression in E. coli. Pelmeg is identical to Neulasta with regard to its amino acid sequence. It 
is  delivered  in  the  same  formulation  (with  the  exception  of  pH  which  is  4.2)  and  presentation  as 
Neulasta,  in  prefilled  syringes  containing  6  mg  of  the  active  substance  in  0.6  mL  solution  for 
subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. 
The proposed indication was as follows: 
“Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
The final agreed wording was as follows: 
“Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
Pelmeg therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or 
haematology. 
The posology is as follows: one 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Pelmeg is recommended for 
each chemotherapy cycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme for Pelmeg was designed and conducted using a sensitive 
comparability approach, waiving clinical efficacy studies in patients. This approach was chosen because 
a validated surrogate marker is available for G-CSF. Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) was used within 
the clinical development programme of Pelmeg as a surrogate for efficacy. The clinical approach is 
furthermore supported by the prerequisite similarity on the physicochemical, biofunctional, and 
preclinical PK/PD level for Pelmeg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018

Two clinical studies were conducted for Pelmeg development: 
−  The pivotal study (study code: B12019-101) was a single-dose, randomised, double-blind, two-
stage, two-way cross-over PK and PD study at a dose of 6 mg. This study enrolled 172 healthy 
subjects  and  assessed  PK  and  PD  as  co-primary  endpoints.  A  comprehensive  immunogenicity 
assay programme, based on actual science for immunogenicity testing was implemented in the 
study. 
−  The  supportive  study  (study  code:  B12019-102)  was  a  multiple-dose,  randomised,  double-
blind,  three-period,  two-sequence  crossover  study  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  and  PD 
comparability  of  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  at  a  dose  of  3  mg.  This  study  enrolled  96  healthy 
subjects  and  assessed  PD  and  immunogenicity  as  co-primary  endpoints.  It  comprised  a 
multiple-dose  parallel-group  part  in  order  to  most  sensitively  detect  differences  in 
immunogenicity, using a sensitive set of assays for immunogenicity testing. 
The  development programme  for  Pelmeg, including clinical development,  is in  line  with  current  CHMP 
guidelines and guidance: 
•  Guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1). 
•  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnologyderived  proteins  as 
active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1). 
•  Guidance 
on 
similar 
biological  medicinal 
products 
containing 
recombinant  GCSF 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005).  This  guideline  is  currently  revised,  see  Concept  paper  on  the 
revision  of  the  guideline  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  similar  biological  medicinal 
products 
containing 
recombinant 
granulocyte-colony 
stimulating 
factor 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/214262/2015). 
Moreover,  the  clinical  development  programme  was  based  on  the  EMA  scientific  advice  the  Applicant 
received for Pelmeg development in 2015: 
1.  The  CHMP  endorsed  the  assessment  of  clinical  comparability  with  two  clinical  trials  conducted  in 
healthy  volunteers.  This  study  population  is  most  sensitive  with  regard  to  detecting  any  potential 
differences  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta.  Factors  with  potential  impact  on  PK,  PD,  safety  and 
immunogenicity,  like  drug-drug  interactions,  co-morbidities  or  immunosuppression  are  less  or  not 
present in healthy volunteers as compared to cancer patients. 
2.  The  CHMP  agreed  to  the  use  of  ANC  as  a  validated  surrogate  marker  for  demonstration  of 
comparable efficacy, particularly if investigated in healthy volunteers. 
3. The CHMP endorsed to investigate PK and PD comparability in a crossover study design as proposed 
for study B12019-101. 
4.  The  CHMP  confirmed  the  approach  to  evaluate  immunogenicity  in  a  clinical  trial  designed  as  a 
parallel-group study (study B12019-102) with repeated dosing of the same IMP. As immunogenicity is 
known to be low for filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, the investigation of immunogenicity in a parallel-arm 
design with healthy volunteers uses the most sensitive model for that purpose. 
5. The CHMP requested additional PD evaluation, and suggested a dose in the range of 2-4 mg. The 3 
mg  dose  was  selected  for  study  B12019-102  as  this  is  within  the  ascending  part  of  the  dose-effect 
curve of pegfilgrastim12, thus further enhancing the sensitivity of the chosen clinical study design. Also, 
the 3 mg dose was chosen based on operational reasons, to ensure precise dosing.

Based  on  the  above,  no  confirmatory  clinical  studies  in  patients  were  conducted  to  demonstrate 
comparability of Pelmeg with Neulasta. 
GCP 
The non-clinical PK/PD study was performed according to GLP.  
Both  submitted  clinical  trials  are  claimed  to  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice 
(GCP)  as  referenced  in  ICH  guidelines  and  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  principles  stated  in  the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pelmeg is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol polymer chain), long-acting form of human recombinant 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) and is developed as a similar biological 
medicinal product to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim), as the reference medicinal product (RMP) for Pelmeg.  
The finished product (FP) is presented as a solution for injection containing 6 mg of pegfilgrastim (INN) 
as active substance. The product is available in a 0.6 ml pre-filled syringe. Other ingredients are: 
sodium acetate; sorbitol (E420); polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
It is delivered in the same formulation (with the exception of pH (which is 4.2) and presentation, as 
Neulasta. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The INN for Pelmeg active substance (AS) is pegfilgrastim. It is a clear and colourless liquid. Human G-
CSF is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone 
marrow.  
Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pelmeg AS, is expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and has an 
identical amino acid sequence as natural human G-CSF, except for an additional N-terminal methionine 
residue for the expression in E. coli (recombinant methionyl human granulocycte colony-stimulating 
factor (rHU-met-G-CSF)). Pelmeg AS is identical to Neulasta with regard to its amino acid sequence.  
Recombinant filgrastim is pegylated by the addition of a single 21 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
moiety to the amino terminus of the protein. The protein is not glycosylated and polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) residues are added. Filgrastim contains five cysteine residues. Four of these are involved in 
disulphide bonds (i.e. cysteines 37 and 43, cysteines 65 and 75) while the cysteine at position 18 
remains free.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacture of the active substance takes place at 3P Biopharmaceuticals in Spain. Appropriate 
GMP certificates have been provided.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Pelmeg consists of fermentation, cell lysis, inclusion body recovery, 
inclusion body solubilisation and refolding prior to purification via a series of chromatography and 
filtration steps to produce the filgrastim critical intermediate. Filgrastim is then purified prior to 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 13/79 
 
 
 
pegylation and further chromatographic and filtration purification steps follow. Finally, the active 
substance is sterile-filtered at room temperature into a container-closure system (of specified 
composition) and stored as the final AS. No reprocessing has been claimed during AS manufacture. 
The containers comply with Ph. Eur. and USP requirements for container closure systems and plastic 
immediate packaging materials. Suitability of the container closure system has been investigated in a 
leachable study. Relevant process controls are in place to ensure control and consistency of the 
process and of the active substance. In general, the manufacturing process has been sufficiently 
described and in-process controls are adequately set to control the process.  
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in the AS manufacturing process are described and are either compendial grade 
or are tested according to in-house standards. The composition of the different media and buffers is 
sufficiently detailed. The starting material of the PEG moiety has been defined; activated PEG is re-
classified as an intermediate further to the major objection raised during the procedure.  No human or 
animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process, nor used in the 
manufacture of the MCB. 
Filgrastim, the protein moiety of Pelmeg AS, is expressed in E. coli cells. The complete nucleotide 
sequence for the expression of filgrastim is included in the marketing authorisation application, along 
with information on the synthesis of the vector and its transformation into cells. 
A two-tiered cell banking system is used and information is provided regarding testing of MCB and 
WCB and release of future WCBs. Cell banks have been tested for viable cells, purity, identity and 
genetic stability with characterisation also of end of production cells (EOPCs). Cell bank storage is 
described and is acceptable. The cell bank system (MCB and WCB) has been described, including 
information on the cell bank stability program and further testing on the EOPCs. Generation, testing 
and release of future WCBs will follow the same protocol as used for the initial WCB. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of the process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) in place 
throughout the manufacturing process of the AS is given. An iterative approach was utilised to identify 
critical process parameters (CPPs) for the critical process steps. The potential CPPs identified using a 
risk assessment failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) approach were further investigated in process 
characterisation studies and using knowledge gained from commercial scale manufacturing experience. 
This allowed identification of proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for scale-independent critical process 
parameters (CPP), which could be used to support assessment of impact on AS quality in the event of 
deviation from the normal operating range (NOR). The NORs have been set based on the data and 
experience gained from a suitable number of validation batches.  
Intermediate storage times were established by respective stability studies and hold times during 
manufacture are described and supported by data. Column resin cleaning, regeneration and re-use 
have been described as has membrane re-use, where applicable. The manufacturing process 
incorporates several mechanisms to ensure the active substance meets predetermined quality criteria 
for microbiological control.  
Filgrastim is considered as a critical intermediate. Currently, the proposed combination of tests is 
sufficiently indicative of potency. Batch analysis and stability data of filgrastim are acceptable. The 
proposed storage condition and time for this intermediate in specified bags is accepted.  
The starting material has been defined for the PEG moiety. The manufacturing process has been 
elaborated in sufficient detail. Data on specifications of the activated mPEG and the starting material, 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018

batch release and stability data of starting material and intermediate and storage conditions have been 
provided.  
Process validation 
Following process development and scale-up to the commercial batch scale, the Process Performance 
Qualification (PPQ) campaign was executed to demonstrate that the process consistently delivers a 
product that meets pre-defined acceptance criteria for quality. Process performance consistency was 
demonstrated through the control of CPPs and via introduction of process performance parameters (i.e. 
IPCs), which were maintained within the pre-determined acceptance criteria. 
In general, all the CPPs and IPCs were within the pre-determined acceptance ranges. Any deviations 
were appropriately investigated and none challenged the conclusions of the process validation. The 
validation of the Pelmeg DS manufacturing process provides sufficient evidence that the process, when 
operated within established parameters, performs effectively and reproducibly. The hold time steps 
used during AS manufacture were properly validated. Also impurity clearance was validated, showing 
that the process is capable of removing process-related impurities in a consistent way to sufficiently 
low levels. Host cell proteins (HCPs), host cell DNA and other specified residuals were identified as 
likely impurities in Pelmeg AS. Acceptable levels of impurities were determined based on safety 
assessment that determined the acceptable daily exposure and historical data from commercial 
manufacturing batches.  
Clearance of relevant impurities to acceptable levels was demonstrated during the PPQ campaign and 
will be monitored during commercial manufacturing. In line with guideline ICH Q3D, elemental 
impurities were assessed. A risk assessment of organic solvents in Pelmeg AS was also conducted. 
Stated impurities have been present in batches studied in non-clinical and clinical studies. 
For the chromatographic purification steps, studies were performed to define and validate the column 
resin lifetimes.  
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing process development was performed in three stages:  
• 
Early stage development of the upstream and downstream processes at batch scale 
•  Scale up  
• 
Late stage development to confirm normal operating ranges (NORs) assigned to each CPP and 
to create proven acceptable ranges (PARs) as well as scale down model qualification. 
The biosimilarity testing, non-clinical, and clinical studies were performed with the final commercial 
scale material. All process changes were introduced prior to non-clinical studies. The non-clinical study, 
as well as the clinical studies, were conducted using post-change product material of the final 
commercial scale process. 
Overall, the history of the manufacturing process development is well-described. Changes to the 
process during development are described and justified sufficiently. 
Characterisation 
To ensure appropriate safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics, an extensive analytical program was 
executed to demonstrate that Pelmeg AS has the expected structure and function based on known 
information about pegfilgrastim. Characterisation studies were designed to interrogate all aspects of 
structure and biological function and potency. Physicochemical properties investigated included: intact 
mass determination; polydispersity analysis; structural characterisation, including analysis of amino 
acid sequence, pegylation site, and disulphide bridging; higher order structure; post-translational

modifications and biological activity. Pelmeg AS mass distribution was in the expected range. The 
complete amino acid sequence was verified. The filgrastim protein is pegylated at the same site as 
described for the reference product (the N-terminal methionine). The disulphide bond structure of 
pegfilgrastim and filgrastim was shown to be consistent with the expected structure. 
Post-translational modifications, other product-related variants and relevant degradation pathways 
within the protein sequence of pegfilgrastim were identified and quantified for both active substance 
and finished product. Stressed stability studies showed that some oxidation and deamidation may 
occur during shelf life. However, these modifications did not impact potency. 
The potency of Pelmeg AS was analysed using a cell proliferation assay, which measures the biological 
activity of pegfilgrastim based on its binding to, and induction of the proliferation of specified cells. The 
method is closely aligned with the Ph.Eur. method for potency assay of filgrastim. The receptor binding 
properties of Pelmeg AS were also studied. 
Specification 
The AS specifications include tests for: characteristics (e.g. colour and clarity of solution), identity, 
purity/impurities, content, potency and excipients. In general, the specifications proposed are 
acceptable and properly justified. The applicant is recommended to continue exploring the 
implementation of an alternative, more accurate analytical method to determine polysorbate 20 levels 
in the active substance specification (see recommendation). In the meantime, to ensure adequate 
control of polysorbate 20, the Applicant has introduced appropriate in-process controls on polysorbate 
20 solutions used for formulation. 
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures used for release and stability testing 
are provided. For the compendial methods, no method descriptions are submitted which is acceptable, 
as they are performed according to the respective Ph. Eur. monographs. The descriptions are of 
sufficient detail. An in vitro proliferation assay is used for potency determination. It determines 
potency of human modified Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (i.e. pegylated G-CSF) using a 
specified cell line, which proliferates only in the presence of G-CSF. The method is closely aligned to 
the Ph.Eur potency assay for filgrastim.   
Batch analysis 
Batch data were provided (several commercial-scale and process batches including non-clinical, clinical 
and process validation batches) showing that all batches were consistent and complied with the 
specifications. 
Reference materials 
The applicant has described the qualification of the different reference standards that were used during 
development of Pelmeg, as well as the primary and secondary reference standard that will be used for 
commercial production. In addition, an analytical testing programme for future secondary reference 
standards was provided. It was confirmed and included in the MAA file that any future secondary RS 
will be tested according to the test panel described in the dossier. In addition to the qualification 
against the primary reference standard, the future secondary reference standards will be calibrated 
against the International Pegfilgrastim Reference Standard. This information has been integrated into 
the dossier.

Stability 
The proposed shelf life for the Pelmeg AS in the specified container closure system has been described.  
Stability studies under long-term, accelerated and stress conditions have been performed on Pelmeg 
AS. Some studies are still on-going. Stability studies are conducted in line with ICH guidance. 
The proposed shelf is based on the current, available long-term stability data of AS batches. 
The primary stability studies included clinical batches and a suitable number of process validation 
batches. These studies have now been completed. Updated stability data have been provided including 
additional data from process validation batches. Accelerated and stress condition studies have been 
completed. 
Supportive stability data from a development batch used in the pre-clinical programme (non-GMP 
batch) are also available. 
The initial stability data demonstrated that most of the AS quality parameters are stable and do not 
show any trends. Updated stability data revealed that most of the AS quality parameters are stable 
and do not show any trends. However, updated stability data revealed that results for some tests were 
above the limits for some batches (at several time points) due to storage in small scale containers. No 
OOS results have been observed at FP level for stability, indicating that full scale AS is being stored 
properly. Stability data thus far for the commitment batches show that all parameters were well within 
the acceptance criteria. It was therefore demonstrated that the issues are related to storage in the 
small containers, and not to the active substance itself. The study is planned to continue. The Applicant 
is requested to submit the long term stability data of the additional active substance batches when the 
study has been completed (see recommendation). Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life 
for the active substance can be accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The final formulation of Pelmeg is a sterile, clear, colourless solution for injection in a disposable, 
single-use, 0.6 ml pre-filled syringe (PFS) with automatic needle safety guard. 
Pelmeg is identical to Neulasta in terms of pharmaceutical strength, composition, route of 
administration, as well as presentation. Moreover, the formulation of Pelmeg is also identical to 
Neulasta (with a slightly higher pH for Pelmeg of 4.2). The intended Pelmeg commercial formulation is 
that used in clinical studies. 
The following excipients, all complying with Ph.Eur. are added at the final stage of the manufacturing 
process of the active substance: sodium acetate (buffer), sorbitol (E420 (solvent)), polysorbate 20 
(surfactant) and water for injection; if necessary, pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric 
acid to pH 4.2. Unlike for Neulasta, nitrogen is used during filling to decrease the potential oxidation of 
the product. This is acceptable. There are no overages. There is an overfill to allow withdrawal of 0.6 
ml.  
Pelmeg is presented in a pre-filled glass syringe (Type I glass) with a rubber stopper and a stainless 
steel needle with an automatic needle guard. The needle cap is latex-free. The container closure was 
selected to mimic Neulasta and complies with EU requirements. The integrity of the container closure 
system has been studied during development. Leachables and extractables have been studied. The 
Pelmeg prefilled syringe (PFS) is assembled with a specific needle-safety device (NSD). The same 
medical device is used in the reference product Neulasta. This was assessed for suitability during the 
review. 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 17/79 
 
 
 
Formulation studies were performed with a focus on the optimisation of the formulation buffer. The 
choice of the buffer system and pH were discussed and the difference in the pH value compared to the 
reference product in the formulation sufficiently justified by data. This case is acceptable and does not 
exclude biosimilar comparability to the reference product. 
Critical aspects in the manufacturing process development were discussed by the applicant. 
Microbiological attributes have been sufficiently discussed, and do not raise any questions or concerns.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is released by PharmaKorell GmbH in Germany.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing scale (fermentation) for the FP has been defined.  
The FP manufacturing process therefore comprises formulated bulk sterile filtration of Pelmeg AS 
(post-filtration integrity testing is conducted), syringe filling, stoppering and final packaging assembly. 
No further formulation is performed on Pelmeg AS after it is introduced into specified containers. All 
steps of the Pelmeg FP manufacturing process are considered critical and are thus strictly controlled 
during the manufacturing process. The processes for filling and packaging of Pelmeg follow established 
standard operations for the manufacturing of parenteral products in PFS. Critical process parameters 
and in-process tests are sufficiently described. 
Process validation studies using an appropriate number of batches were performed to demonstrate that 
the manufacturing process operated within the established parameters and was capable of effectively 
and reproducibly producing product that meets pre-defined acceptance criteria. The following 
validation studies related to the manufacturing of Pelmeg have been performed: cleaning validation; 
sterility validation; aseptic filling process validation; packaging and shipping validation. 
The validation data show that the process is robust and well controlled. Since manufacturing and 
evaluation of additional batches is not possible within the EMA review procedure, the Applicant is 
recommended to provide validation data on filling for additional FP batches (using the optimised 
nitrogen supply and filling speed), as soon as those data are available. 
Product specification 
The Pelmeg FP specifications include general tests (e.g., colour and clarity of solution, extractable 
volume, container appearance) as well as tests for identity, purity, impurities, content and potency. 
The applicant provided acceptable justifications for the specifications. Analytical methods were 
sufficiently described and non-compendial methods were validated. 
As there are no additional formulation steps prior to Pelmeg filling, the product impurities present in 
Pelmeg are the same as those identified and controlled in Pelmeg AS. 
In general, the product-related impurities of Pelmeg are at low levels. Aggregate levels, which could be 
a potential safety concern, are at non-critical levels. Charged variants are very low and the total pre- 
and post-peaks in RP-HPLC testing are also low. 
The Applicant is recommended to revise the CEX-HPLC specification limit when data from further 
batches are available (see recommendation). 
For elemental impurities, a risk assessment has been performed for Pelmeg AS. Extractable studies 
have been performed and no potential leachable compounds were found. For the control of 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 18/79 
 
 
 
microbiological attributes, sterility and endotoxin testing as well as container closure integrity are 
performed as release tests. In conclusion, the specifications are acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The FP analytical methods are similar as those used for the AS release testing.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data from development, clinical and a suitable number of validation lots are presented. Batch 
data indicate consistent quality of batches which all comply with the specifications. 
Reference materials 
Pelmeg FP is released against the same reference standards and control materials described for AS.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 24 months is proposed for Pelmeg, when stored at 2°C - 8°C and kept in the in the outer 
carton in order to protect from light.  
Stability studies include commercial scale, development and process validation run (PVR) batches. The 
stability studies involve formal studies at long-term, accelerated and stress conditions, which are 
performed at 5°C ± 3°C, 30°C ± 2°C/65% ± 5% relative humidity (RH) and 40°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% 
RH, respectively in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
The proposed shelf life for Pelmeg is 24 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C. No critical changes were 
observed at long-term conditions. The available stability data show that the FP is stable and support 
the proposed shelf life of 24 months for the FP. No critical changes were observed at long-term 
conditions. 
In addition, temperature excursion studies (out-of-fridge, OOF and freeze/thaw, F/T) are performed 
batches to assess the stability of Pelmeg under normal use conditions. Photostability was also studied.  
The available stability show that the FP is stable. Overall, the available data support the proposed shelf 
life of 24 months for the FP.  
The applicant is asked to provide the stability data for deamidation and oxidation when the long term 
stability studies for specified FP batches 17001 and 17002 have been completed (see 
recommendation).  
The FP shelf life may be extended to 36 months via a variation procedure once 36m stability data are 
available for the 2 batches produced with the commercial process (lots 17001 and 17002). 
The Applicant has provided the OOF stability results, which demonstrate that Pelmeg remains stable at 
30 ± 2 °C for a single period of 96 hours after 36 months storage at long-term conditions. The F/T 
results demonstrate that Pelmeg remains stable for two periods of less than 72 hours. 
The following special precautions for storage are supported by the stability data and are approved in 
the SmPC: Pelmeg may be exposed to room temperature (not above 30°C) for a maximum single 
period of up to 96 hours. Pelmeg left at room temperature for more than 96 hours should be 
discarded. Do not freeze. Accidental exposure to freezing temperatures for two periods of less than 72 
hours does not adversely affect the stability of Pelmeg. 
A shelf-life of 24 months is agreed for Pelmeg, when stored at 2°C - 8°C.

Adventitious agents 
Microbial adventitious agents are controlled throughout the manufacture of Pelmeg AS and Pelmeg FP. 
Pelmeg AS is checked for bioburden as IPC prior to sterile filtration and filling. The FP is sterile filtered 
and Pelmeg is tested for sterility and container closure integrity at release. Only raw materials and 
excipients certified as of non-animal origin are used for manufacture of Pelmeg AS and FP. 
The host cell used for the manufacture of Pelmeg AS is an E. coli derivative. Based on the microbial 
nature of the manufacturing process and the materials used (none of animal origin), the risk of viral 
contamination of Pelmeg can be excluded. 
Biosimilarity analysis 
Biosimilarity of Pelmeg to the RMP was assessed during development using physicochemical and 
biofunctional data from side-by-side studies. The side-by-side physicochemical and biofunctional 
similarity assessments have been supplemented by side-by-side stability testing to demonstrate that 
the degradation behaviour of Pelmeg is similar to that of the RMP. 
First, multiple batches of the RMP were sourced in order to establish the Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP). An initial similarity assessment was performed at pilot scale using several Pelmeg AS and 
several EU-authorised RMP batches in order to steer the development process. The AS manufacturing 
process was then scaled-up to the final commercial scale, whereby the manufacturing process was 
adjusted and modified to fit to the increased scale. This scale-up was guided by the QTPP and the 
critical quality attribute (CQA) assessment. Next, a side-by-side study at commercial scale, compared 
Pelmeg FP batches of commercial scale against RMP batches. Finally, a second side-by-side study at 
commercial scale compared several Pelmeg batches and several RMP batches. The non-clinical and 
clinical studies were performed with batches from the final manufacturing process at commercial scale. 
Moreover, non-clinical and clinical batches were included in the aforementioned side-by-side studies. 
Pelmeg is delivered in an identical formulation and the same presentation as the RMP, with the 
exception of pH. Pelmeg's pH (4.2) is slightly higher than that of the RMP and was chosen to provide 
optimal conditions for a stable buffer system for Pelmeg. This slightly increased pH in comparison to 
the RMP has no impact on the structure and biological function of Pelmeg as demonstrated by the 
physicochemical and biofunctional similarity data. Analytical data obtained fora suitable number of EU-
authorised RMP batches over all stages of product development formed the basis of the similarity 
range for each quality attribute (QA) to which Pelmeg results were compared. The analytical similarity 
exercise was performed on several commercial scale Pelmeg lots versus several RMP batches, 
depending on the method and parameter tested. To analyse whether similarity to the RMP was met, 
the results were evaluated against the similarity range. More detailed information including a 
justification on the batches used (age/number) for specific tests was provided. 
State-of-the-art, orthogonal analytical methods were employed to characterise structural and 
functional similarities and differences to demonstrate analytical similarity between Pelmeg and the 
RMP. Also comparative stability and degradation profiles were assessed.  
Primary Structure 
The complete amino acid sequence of Pelmeg was verified and is identical to the amino acid sequence 
of the RMP. The correct formation of the disulphide bridges (Cys37-43, Cys65-75) was confirmed. No 
peptides containing disulphide bonded cysteine 18 or mispaired disulphides were found.

Intact mass and PEGylation 
MALDI-TOF/TOF and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) were used to compare the molecular weight of 
Pelmeg and RMP. MS analysis showed that Pelmeg and the RMP have similar mass. Mono-PEGylation at 
the N-terminal methionine was confirmed for Pelmeg. There are 4 lysines (K17, K24, K35 and K41) 
which are considered putative sites for positional pegylation. No signals for the pegylated peptides 
containing lysines K17, K24, K35 and K41 were found. 
The PEG average molecular weight and polydispersity index were compared for Pelmeg and RMP side-
by-side using ESI-MS and found to be similar. The size profiles and PEG moieties of Pelmeg and the 
RMP were also compared. 
Higher order structure 
Pelmeg CD data and near-UV CD were compared with the RMP and revealed a high level of similarity. 
Far-UV CD data suggested α-helices to be the predominant secondary structure (at 25°C between 75% 
and 78%) with the 3/10 helix being the second most dominant structure. A very small percentage of β-
sheets were determined.  
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed and showed that the melting temperatures of 
Pelmeg and RMP (to assess the similarity of higher order structure) were comparable between the two 
products. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to compare the conformation of Pelmeg and RMP giving 
similar results. 
Purity and impurities 
Cation exchange chromatography (CEX) was used to evaluate similarity of Pelmeg and RMP with 
respect to charge variant profiles. Overall, the profile of main acidic and basic variants of Pelmeg 
closely matched that of the RMP, suggesting comparable isoform profiles between the two products. 
The main variant level of Pelmeg showed higher amounts than observed in the RMP, demonstrating a 
higher charge-related purity of Pelmeg compared to the RMP. However, this difference is not clinically-
meaningful given that the material analysed via CEX was also used in a clinical study that showed a 
high degree of comparability between Pelmeg and the RMP. Thus, it can be concluded that the charged 
variant profile of Pelmeg is similar to the RMP. 
Capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) was performed to compare the isoelectric points (pI) of Pelmeg and 
RMP. The pI of Pelmeg and RMP by cIEF was comparable, suggesting a comparable structure. One 
batch of Pelmeg showed a slightly higher pI. This difference is covered by the variability of the method. 
Moreover, this particular batch was also used in a clinical study that showed a high degree of 
comparability between Pelmeg and the RMP. 
Reversed phase chromatography (RP-HPLC), which separates product variants, including oxidised and 
deamidated species on the basis of hydrophobicity, was performed and showed comparability between 
Pelmeg and RMP purity profiles. The sums of pre-peaks and post-peaks were also similar between 
Pelmeg and the RMP, suggesting comparable hydrophobicity-related impurity profiles between the two 
products. 
The level of methionine 122 oxidation was found to be similar between Pelmeg and the RMP. The 
methionine 127 or 138 oxidation data showed variability, and results for two Pelmeg batches were 
slightly outside the pre-specified similarity limits. However, this is not considered critical as these 
values indicate Pelmeg contains less oxidation than the RMP. Furthermore, no impact was observed in 
the clinical studies performed with these lots. 
Post-translational modifications were investigated. For both products, the impurity profile was found to 
be similar. The overall level of modifications is also similar, but slightly higher in the RMP. However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 21/79 
 
 
 
the latter may be due to the age differences between Pelmeg and the RMP batches that were analysed. 
The most prominent post-translational modifications detected were the following: Single oxidation at 
tryptophan (W) 119 or methionine (M) 122; Single oxidation at methionine (M) 127 or methionine (M) 
138; Single deamidation at glutamine (Q) 108, 120 or 121.  
The identity measured via immunoreactivity (western blot analysis) for Pelmeg and the RMP was 
similar. In addition, size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was performed to compare the 
monomer and aggregate content of Pelmeg and the RMP.  
Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed to provide an orthogonal comparison of monomer, 
oligomer and higher oligomer proportions of Pelmeg and the RMP. Overall, sedimentation patterns 
were similar for Pelmeg and the RMP, suggesting comparable amounts of monomers, and low and 
higher oligomers for the two products. 
Free PEG 
The levels of residual PEG for Pelmeg and the RMP were compared by RP-HPLC-ELSD and revealed a 
high level of similarity. 
General properties 
Extinction coefficients of Pelmeg closely matched that of the RMP, suggesting comparable amino acid 
content. Pelmeg protein content for all batches was within the range of the RMP, which reveals a high 
level of similarity for protein content between Pelmeg and the RMP. Osmolality and extractable 
volumes were also measured for Pelmeg and RMP and closely matched. 
Potency comparison by cell proliferation assay 
The relative potency of Pelmeg and RMP was compared by proliferative bioassay (cell proliferation 
assay measures the biological activity of pegfilgrastim) and in general, revealed a high level of 
similarity. This assay is closely aligned to the Ph.Eur potency assay for filgrastim.  
Receptor binding comparison by SPR 
The functional similarity of Pelmeg and RMP was also found comparable by measuring receptor binding 
to the recombinant human G-CSF receptor (rhG-CSFR) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  
Results of comparative stability 
Comparative stability testing of Pelmeg and RMP was performed using a variety of stability-indicating 
methods. The results of the comparative stability testing showed a high level of similarity between 
Pelmeg and the RMP for all attributes tested. Purity and impurity profiles as measured by RP-HPLC 
showed similar degradation rates. Potency also showed similar trends for both Pelmeg and RMP.

Neulasta is summarised in the tables below.

Conclusion on biosimilarity (quality level) 
The primary structure of Pelmeg was found to be identical to that of the RMP, with identical site of 
pegylation for both products. Molecular weight and polydispersity indicated similar PEG moieties 
between Pelmeg and the RMP. Moreover, the higher order structure, product-related variants, and the 
impurity and aggregation profiles, were also shown to be similar between Pelmeg and the RMP. 
Furthermore, relative potency and recombinant human G-CSF receptor binding kinetics were similar for 
Pelmeg and the RMP. Comparative stability testing demonstrated that Pelmeg and the RMP degrade in 
a comparable manner. In conclusion, the data of the physicochemical, biofunctional, and stability tests 
indicate that the proposed biosimilar biological product Pelmeg is similar to the RMP.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The AS and FP manufacturing process and process controls are described, as are raw materials. A cell 
bank system was established and tested and qualified. Critical process parameters were identified and 
the process was appropriately validated. As regards the activation of PEG into activated PEG, the 
applicant has provided detailed information on the process and controls.  
As regards the AS stability, the Applicant is requested to submit the long term stability data of the 
additional active substance batches (in a specified container-closure system) post-approval, when the 
study has been completed (see recommendations).   
As regards the FP manufacturing process, validation data on filling for additional FP batches (using 
specified optimised parameters) are expected post-approval (see recommendations).The AS and FP 
specifications proposed by the applicant are deemed suitable to control the quality of AS and FP. 
Analytical methods were described in detail. AS and FP specifications are properly justified. As regards 
CEX-HPLC, due to the limited data available for this quality parameter, the applicant has proposed a 
more flexible limit. This is deemed acceptable, however the applicant has been asked to revise the 
CEX-HPLC acceptance limit when more data are available (see recommendations). The applicant will 
also submit a variation post-approval to set definitive specification limits for polysorbate 20 based on a 
higher number of batches (see recommendations). 
For Pelmeg AS, an appropriate shelf life and storage conditions have been defined. This shelf life is 
based on the current, available long-term stability data.  
The proposed shelf life for Pelmeg FP is 24 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C. The available stability data 
support this. The applicant should however provide, post-approval, the results for deamidation and 
oxidation when the long term stability studies for specified FP batches have been completed (see 
recommendations).  
The OOF study suggests that the FP remains stable when exposed to 30°C for 96 hrs.  
Biosimilarity analysis 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant has performed an extensive comparability exercise between 
EU Neulasta and Pelmeg FP (including both process validation and clinical batches). In general, all 
quality attributes analysed proved to be highly similar between Pelmeg and EU Neulasta. For a few 
parameters slight differences were observed. However, these differences were properly justified and 
shown to have no impact on safety or efficacy of the product. Importantly, functional testing showed 
high similarity between both products. From a quality point of view Pelmeg can be considered as 
biosimilar to EU Neulasta. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The manufacturing processes for Pelmeg AS and FP are adequately described, sufficiently controlled 
and properly validated. AS and FP are sufficiently controlled. Container closure systems of AS and FP 
were qualified. The currently available stability data for AS and FP do not indicate any decrease or 
trends for potency or purity. The data of the physicochemical, biofunctional, and stability tests 
confirmed that from a quality point of view Pelmeg can be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta.  
In conclusion, the quality section of the Pelmeg MAA file is approvable and several recommendations 
for future quality development are made. 
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant is recommended to continue exploring the implementation of an alternative, 
more accurate analytical method to determine polysorbate 20 levels in the active substance. 
Upon method validation, this alternative method may be implemented via a variation 
procedure post-approval. When this variation will be submitted post-approval, it is expected 
that the specification be revised. 
The applicant is recommended to submit the long term stability data of the additional active 
substance batches in the specified container-closure system when the study has been finalised. 
The applicant is recommended to provide additional validation data on filling of FP using 
specified optimised conditions as soon as these data are available. 
The applicant is recommended to revise the limit for the CEX-HPLC specification of the finished 
product (including an appropriate justification) if possible, when additional data are available. 
The applicant is recommended to provide the stability data for deamidation and oxidation when 
the long term stability studies for finished product batches have been completed. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the  biosimilarity  of  Pegfilgrastim  (Pelmeg) 
compared  to  Neulasta,  using  a  variety  of  batches  of  both  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta.  Biosimilarity  studies 
included  in  vitro  cell-based  models  (M-NFS-60  cells,  a  murine  myeloblastic  cell  line)  and  receptor 
binding assays by SPR; and in vivo PK/PD studies in normal and neutropenic rats. 
The nonclinical programme of pegfilgrasim included a series of in vitro comparative studies including a 
cell proliferation assay on a specified cell line (method closely aligned to the Ph.Eur method for potency 
assay of filgrastim) and a comparison of binding to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-
CSFR) by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). 
A  GLP-compliant  non-clinical  comparative  study  in  healthy  and  neutropenic  rats,  which  evaluated 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  after  a  single  dose  of  15  or  100  μg/kg  was  also 
conducted to further support the similarity demonstration between Pelmeg and Neulasta.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use  (CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr.  2)  which  states  that  proteins  are  exempted  from  the  need  to  submit 
studies because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment due to their nature, 
the applicant submitted a justification for not submitting an environmental risk assessment. 
Pegfilgrastim  is  already  used  in  existing  marketed  products  and  no  significant  increase  in 
environmental  exposure  is  anticipated.  The  PEG  moiety  of  Pelmeg is  unlikely to  result  in  a  significant 
risk to the environment because of metabolic breakdown before excretion in  patients13,14 and a rapid 
biodegradation in the environment15, 16. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The potency of Pelmeg was measured on 6 Pelmeg batches versus 12 batches of Neulasta by in vitro 
cell-based  models  (M-NFS-60  cells,  a  murine  myeloblastic  cell  line)  and  the  results  show  that  their 
potency is similar.  
The binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor of either Pelmeg and Neulasta was also investigated using a 
validated Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The binding affinities (Kd values) for Pelmeg were found 
similar to those measured for the reference Neulasta.  
Comparability  on  the  non-clinical  level  was  adequately  addressed  according  to  the  current  regulatory 
requirements. Thus, the focus of the demonstration of biosimilarity was on in vitro biofunctional assays 
which revealed biosimilarity between Pelmeg and the reference medicinal product Neulasta. 
A  GLP-compliant  in  vivo  PK/PD  study  was  additionally  performed  in  normal  and  neutropenic  male 
CD/Crl:CD(SD) rats with the aim to compare Pelmeg versus reference. Both Pelmeg and Neulasta were 
compared  in  terms  of  absolute  neutrophil  counts  (ANC).  Results  clearly  demonstrate  the  intended 
pharmacodynamic  effect.  However,  due  to  limitations  of  the  neutropenic  animal  model  and  the  fact 
that  the  study  was  considered  descriptive  only,  a  conclusion  on  statistically-confirmed  in  vivo 
biosimilarity  could  not  be  drawn.  Quality  and  clinical  data  are  considered  to  be  more  relevant  in  this 
respect. Therefore, the in vivo data is acceptable and no further discussion is needed.  
Safety  pharmacology,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  single/repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies were not submitted and are not required as per the latest European 
biosimilar  guidelines  (i.e.  Guidelines  CHMP/437/04  Rev.  1,  EMEA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005  Rev.  1  and  the  annex  to  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance, non-clinical and clinical issues; 
guidance  on  similar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). 
The justification for not submitting environmental risk assessment studies is acceptable. It is unlikely 
that  residues  of  pegfilgrastim  would  persist  in  the  environment  or  cause  inadvertent  environmental 
effects.  The  approval  of  Pelmeg  is  not  expected  to  cause  increases  in  environmental  exposure  above 
existing levels for this active substance or result in  any additional hazards to the environment during

storage,  distribution,  use  and  disposal.  Considering  the  expected  exposure  and  the  nature  of  the 
product,  the  absence  of  formal  environmental  risk  assessment  studies  for  Pelmeg  is  considered 
justified.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  aspects  of  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicology  for  Pelmeg  have  been  well 
characterised  and  are  considered  acceptable.  There  were  no  further  changes  to  the  SmPC  and  the 
product information is aligned with the reference product Neulasta. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pelmeg (B12019) was developed as a similar biological medicinal product to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). 
The  proposed  indication  for  Pelmeg  is  identical  to  the  approved  indication  for  Neulasta.  The 
recommended dose is 6 mg pegfilgrastim to be administered subcutaneously (SC). 
The  clinical  programme  of  Pelmeg  was  comprised  of  two  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  Clinical 
comparability of Pelmeg and Neulasta was evaluated in the pivotal PK/PD study B12019-101 using the 
approved  6  mg  dose.  The  supportive  study  B12019-102  mainly  monitored  immunogenicity,  but  also 
assessed PD comparability of Pelmeg and Neulasta, using a non-therapeutic, lower dose of 3 mg. The 
formulation  used  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  is  the  same  as  the  proposed  commercial 
formulation.

Pegfilgrastim  concentrations  in  serum  were  determined  using  a  quantitative  enzyme  linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  technique.  The  Human  G-CSF  DuoSet  ELISA  kit  (R&D  Systems)  was 
modified  to  determine  Pegfilgrastim  in  human  serum  and  was  validated  for  this  purpose  over  a 
calibration range of 0.20 – 8.00 ng/mL at Celerion Switzerland AG.  
Study B12019-101 
This  was  a  single-dose,  randomised,  double-blind,  two-stage,  two-way  cross-over,  PK/PD  study  of 
Pelmeg  versus  Neulasta  in  healthy  volunteers.  Study  drugs  were  administered  as  s.c.  injections  into 
the abdomen, at a dose of 6 mg. As recommended in different scientific advices, a wash-out phase of 6 
weeks between treatments was applied to avoid any potential for carry-over effects.  
In  order  to  account  for  the  expected  high  variability  of  the  relevant  PK  parameters  (AUC  and  Cmax), 
the  study  methodology  was  based  on  a  two-stage  design,  planning  for  a  sample  size  re-calculation 
after completion of stage 1 and potential sample size adjustment for stage 2. The assumptions used to 
calculate  a  sample  size  of  172  subjects  for  stage  1  are  considered  appropriate  (i.e.  power  of  90%, 
intra-subject CV of maximum 50% for PK parameters, drop out of 10%). According to the predefined 
decision rules, no stage 2 was performed. 
Blood  samples  for  the  determination  of  pegfilgrastim  concentrations  were  collected  during  the  in-
patient  phase,  pre-dose  and  up  to  96  h  post-dose  (day  5),  and  during  the  ambulatory  visits  in  each 
period  (days  6  to  43).  The  primary  PK  variables  were  AUC0-last  and  Cmax,  which  was  agreed  upon  in 
scientific  advice  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/380237/2015.  AUC0-inf  and  t max  were  evaluated  as  secondary  PK 
variables. PK parameters were calculated for all subjects who received a dose of study medication (= 
PK set). 
To  demonstrate  PK  comparability  of  Pelmeg  to  the  reference  product  Neulasta,  the  primary  PK 
parameters  AUC0-last  and  Cmax  were  evaluated  using  an  α1-level  of  0.0284.  For  these  parameters  the 
94.32%  (=(1  -  2α)%)  CI  for  the  test/reference  ratio  were  to  be  contained  within  the  standard 
bioequivalence  acceptance  interval  of  80.00-125.00%.  The  primary  statistical  PK  analysis  was 
performed  on  the  model-based  PK  set,  defined  as  all  subjects  with  reliable  PK  data  for  both  study 
periods. 
Subjects  were  randomised  1:1  to  sequentially  receive  a  6  mg  dose  of  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  or  vice 
versa.  Of  the  172  healthy  subjects  enrolled  and  randomised,  171  subjects  received  study  medication 
(=PK  set)  and  163  subjects  completed  both  study  periods.  Two  subjects  were  excluded  from  the 
model-based PK set (N= 161) due to missing several consecutive study visits in one period. No major

protocol deviations were reported. All subjects were healthy white males. Mean age of the 171 subjects 
included  in  the  PK  set  was  40.9  years  (range  19  to  55  years)  and  mean  weight  was  81.2  kg  (range 
61.3 to 99.3 kg). 
Results 
PK  parameters  AUC0-last,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  were  presented  by  treatment  and  showed  all  a  very  high 
inter-subject  variability  (around  100%).  Geometric  mean  t 1/2  was  about  40  hours  and  median  tmax 
occurred at 16 hours after both treatments. No positive pre-dose samples were measured, except for 
one subject in Period 2.

Biosimilarity was claimed as the 94.32% CIs for the ratio of the test and reference product geometric 
means  for  the  primary  PK  parameters  AUC0-last  and  Cmax  were  fully  contained  within  the  predefined 
acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%. Although no statistical analysis of the secondary PK parameter 
AUC0-inf  was planned per protocol, a post-hoc statistical analysis showed BE criteria were also met for 
this parameter.

**Only subjects of the model-based PK set with data available were included in the statistical analysis (N=146) 
A  re-evaluation  of  the  protein  content  data  of  the  test  and  reference  batches  used  in  this  study  was 
performed based on an optimized UV method. As a result, a difference in protein content of more than 
5%  was  determined  between  both  batches  with  the  Pelmeg  batch  having  a  lower  concentration  than 
the Neulasta batch (9.57 mg/ml versus 10.20 mg/ml). The test/reference ratio for both AUC0-last and 
Cmax  (95.23%  and  92.84%,  respectively)  was  below  100%  and  is  therefore  in  line  with  a  lower 
concentration  of  the  Pelmeg  batch.  In  addition,  the  94.32%  CIs  of  the  test/reference  ratio  for  both 
parameters  (not  corrected  for  protein  content)  were  fully  contained  within  the  acceptance  interval  of 
80.00-125.00%. A post-hoc sensitivity analyses was performed correcting for the difference in protein 
content.  
Other sensitivity analyses that were conducted and included analysis in the subgroup of ADA-negative 
subjects  and  an  analysis  that  excluded  two  outlier  subjects.  Results  for  these  supportive  sensitivity 
analyses were similar to the results of the overall analyses (see table below).

Sensitivity Analyses in Study B12019-101 (Model-Based PK Set) 
Of note, results for the PK parameters AUC0-t and Cmax showed a statistically significant period effect.  
Study B12019-102 
This was a randomised, multiple dose, three-period, two-sequence, cross-over study to mainly assess 
the  immunogenicity  and  PD  comparability  of  3  mg  Pelmeg  (T)  and  Neulasta  (R)  in  healthy  male 
volunteers.  Subjects  were  randomised  (1:1)  to  the  treatment  sequence  T-T-R  or  R-R-T.  Both 
treatments were administered as s.c. injection. Dosing was separated by a wash-out period of 6 weeks 
as was also done for study B12019-101. 
Blood  sampling  was  sparse  (7  PK  samples  in  each  period)  since  no  statistical  comparison  of  PK 
parameters  was  aimed  for.  PK  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  (AUC0-120h,  Cmax  and  t max)  were 
evaluated purely descriptively. 
Overall,  96  healthy  male  subjects  were  randomised  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication. Therefore, all subjects were included in the PK set. Mean age of the 96 subjects was 41.4 
years  (range  21  to  55  years)  and  mean  weight  was  81.8  kg  (range  62.4  to  99.5  kg).  1  subject  was 
Asian, 5 subjects were black, and the majority was white. 
Results 
Based on sparse PK sampling, serum concentration time profiles were similar for Pelmeg and Neulasta, 
with  serum  concentrations  peaking  at  12  hours  post-dose  in  most  subjects.  Variability  for  the  PK 
parameters was very high with geometric CVs above 100% for AUC and Cmax.

698 and 934 h*ng/ml after Neulasta and between 687 and 1107 h*ng/mL after Pelmeg.

Figure 6: 
Mean serum concentration time profiles of pegfilgrastim (ng/ml) by treatment 
and period (PK set, N=96) 
As a result of a systematic handling error when the syringes for the first group of 28 subjects (period 
1) were prepared, the doses administered to these subjects were between 2 and 2.8 mg pegfilgrastim 
instead  of  the  per-protocol  dose  of  3  mg.  Therefore,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  excluding 
cohort  1,  and  period  1  data  from  cohort  1.  This  resulted  in  a  slightly  higher  exposure  than  in  the 
overall analysis, which is in line with the exclusion of data from underdosed subjects in Period 1. 
PK results from pooled analyses 
When comparing the PK results of the two studies (one conducted with 6mg and one with 3mg), it is 
apparent  that  a  dose  effect  can  be  seen.  Cmax  values  increased  with  increasing  pegfilgrastim  dose. 
Increases appear to be greater than dose-proportional, which is in line with literature data on the PK of 
pegfilgrastim17.

AUEC0-last area under the ANC vs. time curve from dosing to last scheduled sample, by linear 
trapezoidal rule. 
Secondary parameters 
• 
• 
Emax maximum effect level (ANC) 
t max, E time of the maximum effect level 
•  CD34+ cell counts 
The primary statistical analysis is based on the model-based PD set (n=161, subjects who completed 
both treatment periods without important protocol deviation), PD set included 167 subjects. 
Results 
The  secondary  ANC  parameters  and  CD34+  cell  counts  were  evaluated  descriptively  between 
treatments. 
Table 12:  
Summary of the PD Parameters of ANC (PD Set, N=167) 
Geometric  mean  AUEC0-last  and  Emax  were  similar  after  administration  of  Neulasta  and  B12019 
(AUEC0-last  of  7110  and  7128  h*G/L  and  Emax  of  35.2  and  34.6  G/L,  respectively).  Variability  was 
moderate  with  geometric  CVs  of  less  than  25%.  The  geometric  mean  ratio  of  AUEC0-last  was  about 
100% and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was very close to 100% (98.67%; 101.75%).

When evaluating ANC time curves, after similar pre-dose values (3.315 and 3.214 G/L) a similar 
increase in mean ANC was observed after dosing of Neulasta and B12019: at 36 hours after dosing 
mean ANC were 32.435 G/L and 31.971 G/L, respectively. ANC values remained on this level until 84 
hours after dosing (30.484 G/L and 29.551 G/L, respectively) and decreased thereafter. Pre-dose level 
was reached again on Day 18 (3.413 G/L and 3.549 G/L, respectively).

In addition, CD34+ counts were analysed as secondary PD endpoint in this study. Similar increases in 
CD34+ cells were seen after administration of Pelmeg and Neulasta. Values peaked at around 5 days 
post-dose,  and  reached  pre-dose  levels  on  Day  12  post-dose.  Overall,  CD34+  profiles  were  very 
similar  for  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta.  In  addition,  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  AUEC0-last  of  CD34+  was 
conducted, using the same model as for the primary PD analysis. In this analysis, the geometric mean 
ratio (Test/Reference) was 98.46, and the corresponding CI was 93.99; 103.14. 
Study B12019-102 
A total of 96 healthy subjects were enrolled and treated with study medication. The primary analysis of 
PD was based on 82 subjects (model-based PD set). The model-based statistical comparisons between 
treatments  only  made  use  of  those  subjects  who  completed  all  treatment  periods  without  any 
important protocol deviation.

To demonstrate PD comparability of B12019 versus Neulasta, the primary PD parameter AUEC0-last was 
calculated.  B12019  and  Neulasta  were  assumed  to  be  comparable  with  regard  to  PD  if  the  95% 
confidence interval of the test/reference ratio lies within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%.

The geometric mean ratio of AUEC0-last was 101,59% with the corresponding 95% confidence interval 
of  99,58%  and  103,63%.  Emax  was  28,4  G/L  and  median  tmax  of  ANC  was  36  hours  after  both 
treatments (PD set). Intra-subject CV was low, with 7.49%. 
The impact of underdosing Cohort 1 in Period 1 was evaluated in sensitivity analyses, excluding Cohort 
1, Period 1, and Period 1 data from Cohort 1, respectively. In all analyses, the geometric mean ratio 
was  around  100%  in  all  sensitivity  analyses,  and  the  corresponding  95%  CIs  were  not  only  fully 
contained in the 80.00-125.00% interval, but also in the tighter interval of 90.00-111.00%.  
When  evaluating  ANC  time  curves,  similar  profiles were  seen  for  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta.  Starting  from 
similar  pre-dose  levels  (around  3  G/L),  comparable  increases  in  mean  ANC  were  observed  after 
administration  of  Pelmeg and  Neulasta.  Peak  levels  were  reached  at  around  36  hours  post-dose,  and 
decreased thereafter. Pre-dose level was reached again on Day 22.

A slight period effect was observed with both Test and Reference product in the model-based PD set. 
ANC AUEC0-last increased 6.3% with Test and 4.97% with Reference when comparing period 3 with 
period 1. The applicant presented a table of ANC values by treatment and period excluding cohort 1 
from all periods: only a slight increase in GMR of ANC AUEC0-t was observed from period 1 to period 3 
with the reference product, whereas with the test product, no increase in ANC was seen (-1.4%). 
In addition, CD34+ counts were analysed as secondary PD endpoint in this study.

Similar increases in CD34+ cells were seen after administration of Pelmeg and Neulasta. Values 
peaked at around 5 days post-dose, and nearly reached pre-dose levels at the last sampling point on 
Day 10 post-dose. Overall, CD34+ profiles were very similar for Pelmeg and Neulasta. In addition to 
the pre-specified analysis, Emax of ANC and AUEC of CD34+ were analysed as secondary PD 
endpoints, using the Analysis of Variance model as for the primary PD analysis. In both analyses, 
geometric mean ratios (Test [T]/Reference [R]) were close to 100%, and the corresponding CIs were 
both fully contained within the acceptance interval of 80.00 - 125.00%.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two  studies  investigated  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  Pelmeg  (B12019-101  and  B12019-102).  The 
reference medicinal product in both clinical studies was EU-approved Neulasta. While the focus of study 
B12019-101  was  on  the  PK/PD  comparability  of  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta,  study  B12019-102  focused  on 
the  PD  and  immunogenicity  comparability  of  the  two  products.  The  main  difference  between  the  two 
studies  was  the  dose  used,  6  mg  in  study  B12019-101  and  3  mg  in  study  B12019-102.  Further  the 
latter  study  contained  3  periods  to  evaluate  ADA  formation  after  repeated  doses  in  a  partial  parallel 
design.  The  treatment  was  switched  after  two periods  for  PD  analysis  with  the  advantage  of  a  cross-
over design. The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, elimination, dose-proportionality and 
time  dependencies,  special  populations,  pharmacokinetics  interaction  studies,  pharmacokinetics  using 
biomaterials  and  mechanism  of  action.  This 
is  acceptable  as  according  to  the  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, these studies are not required. 
In  general,  the  Applicant´s  development  program  to  demonstrate  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and 
pharmacodynamic  (PD)  similarity  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  is  considered  adequate  and  was 
performed  in  line  with  the  guidance  on  similar  biological  products  and  in  line  with  scientific  advice 
received: 
-  Both clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects. Compared to cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy,  healthy  subjects  lack  co-morbidities  and  co-medications  and  are  not 
immunosuppressed.  Therefore,  it  was  agreed  that  they  represent  the  most  sensitive  study 
population for conducting the PK and PD comparison. 
- 
In the pivotal study, B12019-101, a fixed subcutaneous dose of 6 mg pegfilgrastim was used. 
It  was  agreed  in  the  EMA  scientific  advice  that  this  dose  has  sufficient  PK  assay  sensitivity 
since  it  is  in  the  ascending  part  of  the  dose-response  profile  for  AUC  and  Cmax.  In  the 
supportive  study,  PD  comparability  was  investigated  at  a  lower  dose  than  6  mg  as 
recommended in the same scientific advice. The underlying rationale for this was that the 6 mg 
dose  alone  may  not  be  sufficiently  discriminative  and  sensitive  for  the  comparative 
investigation of PD between Pelmeg and Neulasta.  
- 
In both studies a wash-out period of 6 weeks was applied between treatments to avoid bias in 
the  PK  analysis  due  to  increased  clearance  mediated  by  the  neutrophils  not  returned  to  the 
baseline level. 
-  Given  the  expected  high  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  for  pegfilgrastim,  a  cross-over 
design  was  chosen  to  evaluate  PK  and  PD  comparability  in  pivotal  study  B12019-101.  In 
addition,  this  study  was  planned  as  a  two-stage  design  with  sample  size  re-estimation  after 
stage  1.  A  conservative  assumption  of  an  intra-subject  CV  of  50%  was  used  for  sample  size 
estimation for stage 1. 
- 
In study B12019-102, ADA formation was evaluated after the first two periods (TT or RR) prior 
to  switching  to  the  comparative  product  in  period  3.  To  assess  comparative  ADA  formation 
after  two  applications  corresponding  to  a  parallel  design  is  acceptable.  PD  response  (ANC, 
CD34+) was compared, based on the data obtained from all three periods, making use of the 
advantages of a cross-over design (T/R ratios based upon sequences T-T-R and R-R-T).

Pharmacokinetics 
Pegfilgrastim  concentrations  in  serum  were  determined  using  an  ELISA  technique.  The  Applicant 
provided  additional  validation  data  that  showed  acceptable  precision  and  accuracy,  dilutional  linearity 
and sample long-term stability. However selectivity, without applying any correction for endogenous G-
CSF,  could  only  be  shown  if  the  acceptance  criteria  were  widened  to  30%  and  not  for  not  for  20% 
(25% for LLOQ) as defined in the guideline. Since the pivotal PK study B12019-101 had a cross-over 
design,  this  bias  associated  with  the  presence  of  low  levels  of  endogenous  G-CSF  should  have 
influenced  the  sample  measurement  of  both  drugs  in  a  similar  way  and  is  thus  considered  of  minor 
relevance for the similarity assessment. In the pivotal study B12019-101, PK equivalence is claimed as 
the  94.32%  CIs  for  the  ratio of  the  test  and  reference  product  geometric  means  for  the  primary  and 
secondary  PK  parameters  AUC0-last,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  were  fully  contained  within  the  standard 
bioequivalence acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%.  
A  difference  in  protein  content  of  more  than  5%  between  the  test  and  reference  batches  was 
determined post-study using an optimized UV method. Although this %difference is not in line with the 
guideline  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence,  the  impact  on  the  PK  comparability  conclusions  is 
considered to be minor. The test/reference ratio for both AUC0-last and Cmax (95.23% and 92.84%, 
respectively) was below 100% and is therefore in line with a lower concentration of the Pelmeg batch 
compared  to  the  Neulasta  batch  used  in  this  study.  Furthermore,  bioequivalence  was  demonstrated 
without  applying  a  correction  for  protein  content,  which  is  considered  the  worst-case  scenario.The 
results for the PK parameters AUC0-last and Cmax showed a statistically significant period effect. Looking 
at results of LS means by period, it appears that AUC0-last and Cmax are lower on average in Period 2. 
This  is  in  line  with  what  was  to  be  expected.  It  is  known  that  pegfilgrastim  is  mainly  eliminated  by 
neutrophils/precursors  (Yang  et  al.,  Clin.  Pharmacokinet.,  2011)  and  the  period  effect  observed  in 
study  B12019-101  was  most  likely  attributed  to  target-mediated  clearance  of  pegfilgrastim  by  the 
increasing number of neutrophils. The decrease in pegfilgrastim plasma levels could theoretically also 
be  attributed  to  appearance  of  ADAs  decreasing  free  pegfilgrastim  concentrations.  Following  an 
analysis  of  the  relationship  between  positive  signals  for  PEG-reactive  ADAs  in  period  1  and  the  PK 
response profile to administration of 6 mg pegfilgrastim (B12019 or Neulasta) in period 2, a trend for a 
slight  reduction  in  the  PK  response  in  Period  2  for  the  positive  PEG-reactive  ADA  sub-population  was 
observed,  regardless  of  the  identity  of  the  treatment  sequence  (see  Immunogenicity  in  the  clinical 
safety section). Moreover, subjects classified as ADA-positive showed no meaningful differences in PK, 
PD  or  other  clinical  parameters  as  compared  to  ADA-negative  subjects.  Overall,  a  modest  impact  of 
positive  PEG-reactive  antibody  following  the  first  administration  of  6  mg  pegfilgrastim  (Pelmeg  or 
Neulasta)  on  PK  (AUC)  following  administration  of  a  second  6  mg  dose  of  pegfilgrastim  could  not  be 
excluded. The marginal reduction in PK (AUC) was not associated with any reduction in the PD (AUEC 
for ANC). This observation does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
Study  B12019-102  was  not  intended  to  evaluate  PK  equivalence  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta. 
However, based on sparse PK sampling, similar PK profiles were observed and overall, the PK data of 
study  B12019-102  support  the  results on  PK  comparability  between  Neulasta and  Pelmeg  from  study 
B12019-101.

Pharmacodynamics 
In  line  with  CHMP  scientific  advice,  PD  data  in  healthy  volunteers  (absolute  neutrophil  and  CD34+ 
counts)  were  evaluated  as  surrogate  marker  of  clinical  efficacy  and  support  of  biosimilarity  of  both 
products.  For the  assessment  of  the  PD  comparability  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta,  the  primary  PD 
parameter AUEC0-last of ANC was calculated, which had to be contained within the standard acceptance 
range  of  80%  -  125%  with  95%CI,  also  for  other  pharmacodynamic  parameters.  Lower  dose  of 
pegfilgrastim,  that  is  considered  more  sensitive  to  detect  differences  between  products,  has  been 
tested in repeat dose study B12019-102. In this study, the primary endpoint for PD comparability was 
based  on  the  data  obtained  from  all  three  periods,  making  use  of  the  advantages  of  a  cross-over 
design  (T/R  ratios  based  upon  sequences  T-T-R  and  RR-T  will  be  more  robust  and  precise  than 
estimates  obtained  from  a  parallel  design).  As  secondary  pharmacology  the  CD34+  cell  count  were 
also  studied.  The  time  course  of  mean  CD34+  cells  was  similar  when  comparing  the  test  and  the 
reference products. 
The primary PD endpoints have been met in both studies. At the time of scientific advice the Applicant 
has  justified  the  use  of  the  80-125  boundaries in  analogy  to  the  PK  evaluation  and  with  reference  to 
the bioequivalence guideline. However, a justification has been asked whether the chosen boundaries 
are sufficiently tight based on clinical argumentation, and why it is not necessary to use e.g. 85-118, 
or 90-111 as equivalence margins. Following scientific advice, equivalence margins of 90.00-111.00% 
were retrospectively applied for the PD evaluation in both studies with Pelmeg. The provided PD results 
support comparability of PD parameters with tighter equivalence margins. 
In the Study B12019-101, the PD response was similar between test and reference products. The GMR 
of  the  ANC  AUEC0-last  was  almost  100%; the  95% CI  with  99.16;  102.65  was  narrow  and  well  within 
the  acceptance  interval  of  80.00-125.00%.  The  secondary  endpoints  Emax,  t max  of  ANC  and  CD34+ 
count were initially presented only descriptively, their mean values were comparable. 
A period effect was evident in ANC response, i.e. AUEC being higher with test and reference in period 
2.  Higher  neutrophil  counts  are  likely  to  increase  pegfilgrastim  clearance,  resulting in  a  slightly  lower 
exposure in period 2. This observation does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
In  the  Study  B12019-102,  PD  comparability  between  Test  and  Reference  was  shown.  In  the  primary 
analysis  the  GMR  of  AUEC  0-last  (PEP)  was  near  100%.  The  corresponding  95%  confidence  interval 
was  very  close  to  100%  (99.58%;  103.63%)  easily  fulfilling  the  predefined  similarity  criteria  of  80-
125%.  The  intra-subject  CV  of  7.49%  was  low.  Also  the  descriptively  presented  secondary  PD 
endpoints ANC Emax, tmax and CD34+ cell count were very similar. Further sensitivity analyses with 
exclusion of cohort 1, period 1, period 1 data of cohort 1) also supported similarity for PD endpoints. 
For Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102, the Applicant provided a statistical analysis complementing 
the mean CD34+ AUEC 0-last, Emax (post-hoc analysis) and median tmax values. The results presented 
for CD34+ parameters support the comparability. 
In  the  pooled  analyses  of  both  PK/PD  studies,  mean  responses  of  6  mg  pegfilgrastim  were  about 
22% higher with Emax and 15% higher with AUEC0-last compared to 3 mg. Tmax was observed at 60h 
post  dose  with 6  mg  and 36h  post-dose  with  3  mg.  Dose  difference  was  somewhat  more  perceivable 
regarding CD34+. This observation does not have an effect on biosimilarity. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From  a  PK  perspective,  the  claim  of  bioequivalence  is  acceptable  since  the  94.32%  CIs  of  the 
test/reference ratio for both the primary and secondary PK parameters were fully contained within the 
acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00% in the pivotal study B12019-101.  
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 49/79 
 
 
 
Therefore,  overall  PK/PD  data  from  the  two  studies  show  that  similarity  between  Pelmeg  and  the 
reference product Neulasta could be demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No dedicated efficacy studies were performed in patients. For a biosimilar candidate to a pegfilgrastim, 
pivotal  evidence  for  similar  efficacy  can  be  derived  from  the  similarity  in  physicochemical,  functional, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons. Therefore, a dedicated comparative efficacy trial 
was not considered necessary. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  clinical  programme  of  Pelmeg  comprises  two  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  that  contributed  to 
safety and immunogenicity analyses. The approved 6 mg dose was used in the pivotal pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) study B12019-101. The supportive study B12019-102 mainly monitored 
immunogenicity, but also assessed PD comparability of Pelmeg and Neulasta, using a non-therapeutic, 
lower dose of 3 mg which was administered two times in a parallel group part of the study. After two 
administrations  of  Pelmeg,  subjects  received  one  administration  of  Neulasta,  and  in  the  other  arm 
subjects received Pelmeg after two administrations of Neulasta. 
Safety analyses are based on the safety population, defined as all subjects who have received at least 
one  dose  of  study  medication.  Safety  results  are  presented  for  the  pooled  studies,  as  well  as  for  the 
individual studies. For pooling of safety data, the first period of both studies was regarded, as well as 
all  periods  from  both  studies.  The  rationale  for  presenting  also  individual  study  data  is  based  on  the 
two different doses and dosing regimens in the two studies (two doses of 6 mg in study B12019-101 
versus three doses of 3 mg in study B12019-102). 
Safety was evaluated from: 
•  Clinical safety assessments (reported AEs, physical examinations including vital signs and 
digital standard 12-lead ECGs, local tolerability), 
• 
Laboratory safety assessments (standard haematology, coagulation and biochemistry analyses, 
urinalysis). 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  268  subjects  were  randomised,  172  and  96  subjects  in  Studies  B12019-101  and  B12019-
102, respectively. One subject in Study B12019-101 was randomised but not treated (due to the non 
treatment-emergent  AE  tachycardia  in  the  pre-dose  ECG).  Thus,  this  subject  was  not  included  in  the 
safety population. Therefore, the safety population in Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102 consisted 
of 171 and 96 subjects, respectively. The pooled safety population comprised 267 subjects.

Subjects  in  Study  B12019-101  were  exposed  to  two  6  mg  doses  of  study  drug  (one  dose  each  of 
Pelmeg  and  Neulasta).  Subjects  in  Study  B12019-102  were  exposed  to  three  3 mg  doses  of  study 
drug.  Depending  on  the  sequence,  subjects  received  either  two  doses  of  Pelmeg  and  one  dose  of 
Neulasta (Sequence T-T-R), or two doses of Neulasta and one dose of Pelmeg (Sequence R-R-T).  
A total of 259 subjects received at least one dose of Pelmeg (3 mg or 6 mg); 46 of these received two 
doses.  A  total  of  260  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Neulasta  (3  mg  or  6  mg);  45  of  these 
received two doses.  
In  Study  B12019-101,  all  163  subjects  who  completed  the  study,  and  the  two  subjects  who 
discontinued after dosing in Period 2, i.e. 165 subjects, received two dosings of 6 mg study drug. Six 
subjects were dosed in Period 1 only (three with Pelmeg and three with Neulasta).  
In  Study  B12019-102,  all  84  subjects  who  completed  the  study,  and  the  three  subjects  who 
discontinued  after  dosing  in  Period  3,  i.e.  87  subjects,  received  one  injection  of  3  mg  study  drug per 
period. Five subjects were dosed in Period 1 only, and four subjects were dosed in Period 1 and 2. One 
subject randomised to sequence RRT was treated in an incorrect treatment sequence (TRR instead of 
RRT).

Adverse events 
Due  to  the  special  design  of  study  B12019-102  (three-periods,  two-sequences  cross-over),  the 
frequencies  of  TEAEs  were  presented  by  treatment  across  all  periods,  but  also  by  treatment  utilizing 
data  from  Period  1  and  2  only  (referring  to  the  onset  of  the  AEs,  comparing  incidences  of  AEs  which 
occurred during the first two periods in which the study followed a parallel design). 
An  overview  of  TEAEs  in  clinical  studies  with  Pelmeg  is  presented  for  the  individual  and  the  pooled 
studies in Table 22 below.

event. AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 18.1 (study B12019-101) and 19.1 (study B12019-102). Percentages 
are based on N. Adverse events are sorted by descending frequency in SOC (pooled studies). The sum of subjects 
with events at the PT level may be greater than the number of subjects with an event at the SOC level. One subject 
may have had more than one PT event, but was only counted once at the SOC level.  
The  most  frequent  TEAEs  by  SOC  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (80.9%  of 
subjects  overall),  followed  by  nervous  system  disorders  (45.3%  overall),  infections  and  infestations 
(35.2% overall), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (30.7% overall). Most frequently reported PTs 
were  back  pain  (78.3%  overall),  headache  (43.4%  overall),  nasopharyngitis  (32.2%  overall), 
hypoglycaemia (29.2% overall) and pain in extremity (21.3% overall). 
In  the  Study  B12019-101,  the  number  of  subjects  with  TEAEs  was  similar:  81.3%  of  the  subjects 
reported 494 TEAEs after Neulasta and 86.0% reported 485 TEAEs after B12019. The most frequently 
reported  TEAE  was  back  pain,  experienced  by  63.7%  of  the  subjects  after  Neulasta  and  66.7%  after 
B12019, followed by headache, experienced by 30.4% of the subjects after Neulasta and 31.6% after 
B12019. 
Notably higher TEAE frequencies after Pelmeg than after Neulasta were seen in Study B12019-102 for 
the  SOCs  “gastrointestinal  disorders”  (16.7%  vs.  4.2%)  and  “respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders”  (10.4%  vs  4.2%).  The  imbalance  in  these  SOCs  was  mainly  driven  by  subjective 
measurable  symptoms  and  signs  such  as  e.g.  nausea  (R:  1.0%  vs  T:  8.3%)  or  cough  (R:  1%  vs  T: 
6.3%). A root cause analysis has been provided to investigate potential possibilities.  
Most  frequent  in  both  studies  and  with  both  treatments  were  TEAEs  in  the  SOC  musculoskeletal  and 
connective  tissue  disorders.  In  Study  B12019-101,  these  were  reported  for  70.2%  and  71.3%  of 
subjects  after  Neulasta  and  Pelmeg,  respectively  (first  period:  81.4%  and 70.6%).  In  Study  B12019-
102,  a  slightly  lower  percentage  of  subjects  experienced  such  AEs,  60.4%  and  57.3%  after  Neulasta 
and  Pelmeg,  respectively (first  period:  63.8%  and 69.4%).  These  slight differences  in  AE  frequencies 
do not point to a pronounced dose effect. When looking at AEs occurring in the first treatment period 
only, numbers were similar, which indicates that musculoskeletal AEs occur with similar frequencies at 
the beginning of treatment and after re-exposure. 
Within this SOC, back pain and pain in extremity accounted for the majority of TEAEs, while neck pain, 
arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal (chest) pain, bone pain and groin pain were each reported in less 
than 10% of subjects.  
In  both  studies,  around  20%  of  subjects  experienced  drug-related  hypoglycaemia  after  dosing  with 
Pelmeg  or  Neulasta.  Hypoglycaemia  had  to  be  reported  as  AE  if  glucose  levels  decreased  to  3.8 
mmol/L  or  below.  For  further  details  on  events  of  hypoglycaemia  and  glucose  concentrations,  see 
Section laboratory findings below. 
Injection site reactions 
Local  tolerability  at  the  injection  site  was  assessed  pre-dose  and  several  times  post-dose  in  each 
period.  Evaluation  made  use  of  the  injection  site  reaction  score,  ranging  from  0  (none)  to  3 
(severe).The incidence of injection site reactions was higher in study B12019-101, using the 6 mg dose 
and overall the incidence was higher with Pelmeg relative to Neulasta (7 vs. 4). In particular injection 
site  haematoma  were  more  frequent  with  Pelmeg  treatment  (R:  0.0%  vs  T:  1.8%  in  study  B12019-
101). The 267 subjects participating in the two Pelmeg studies received around 600 injections of study 
drug. Considering data from both studies, only 11 of 267 subjects (4.1%) had injection site reactions, 
7  (2.6%)  after  Pelmeg  and  4  (1.5%)  after  Neulasta.  In  all  subjects,  injection  site  reactions  occurred 
only once, even though subjects received 2 injections in Study B12019-101 and 3 injections in Study 
B12019-102. For the individual PTs, some imbalances were seen, e.g. puncture site pain occurred only 
under Neulasta, while injection site haematoma/haematoma was more frequent after Pelmeg.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No death occurred during the two studies in healthy volunteers. Serious adverse events were reported 
for one subject in study B12019-101 (suffering from multiple injuries due to a car accident) and three 
subjects in study B12019-102 (two suffering from influenza and one suffering from local swelling due 
to a facelift). The reported serious events can be considered as unrelated to the study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory AEs 
Blood  samples  for  haematology  and  biochemistry  parameters  and  urine  samples  for  urinalysis  were 
collected  at  screening,  on  Day  -1,  and  several  times  post-dose.  In  both  clinical  studies  with  Pelmeg, 
the  investigator  decided  whether  a  laboratory  abnormality  was  considered  as  an  AE.  In  addition,  for 
certain laboratory parameters of interest (i.e. LFTs, creatinine, electrolytes, haematology, muscle and 
coagulation) specific ranges were defined, outside of which laboratory values were considered clinically 
relevant,  and  had  to  be  reported  as  laboratory  AE.  For  Study  B12019-101,  this  reporting  process 
(including the setup of threshold values for laboratory AEs) was implemented during the study, while 
for  Study  B12019-102  the  process  was  pre-specified.  Laboratory  AEs  were  reported  for  both 
treatments in both studies. 
All laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs in B12019 studies are presented below.

Pooled analyses, Table 4.2.1 in Module 5.3.5.3. 
By  far  the  most  frequent  laboratory  AE  was  hypoglycaemia,  reported  in  around  20%  of  subjects  in 
Studies B12019-101 and B12019-102. Decreases in serum glucose after administration of study drug 
were seen in both clinical studies, and were comparable between treatments.  
In  Study  B12019-101,  mean  glucose  decreased  from  5.13  mmol/L  on  Day  -1  to  a  minimum  of  3.88 
mmol/L  at  Day  3  (48  hours)  after  dosing  with  Neulasta,  and  from  5.11 mmol/L  on  Day  -1  to  a 
minimum  of  3.93  mmol/L  at  Day  3  (48  hours)  after  dosing  with  Pelmeg.  Thereafter  blood  glucose 
increased again and reached pre-dose level on Day 15.  
In  Study  B12019-102,  mean  glucose  decreased  from  5.13  mmol/L  on  Day  -1  to  a  minimum  of  3.93 
mmol/L  at  Day  3  (48  hours)  after  dosing  with  Neulasta,  and  from  5.13  mmol/L  on  Day  -1  to  a 
minimum  of  3.94  mmol/L  at  48  hours  after  dosing  with  Pelmeg.  Thereafter  blood  glucose  increased 
again and reached pre-dose level on Day 15.  
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018  
Page 58/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparable mean decreases in serum glucose of around 1 mmol/L were observed in both studies and 
after both treatments, reaching a maximum at 48 hours after dosing. The similarity of results from the 
two  studies  suggests  that  the  effect  is  not  dose  dependent  at  the  two  doses  studied.  None  of  the 
events of hypoglycaemia was associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or required intervention.  
In  both  studies,  an  inverse  relationship  was  observed  for  the  time  pattern  of  glucose  and  ANC 
concentrations. Mean ANC increased until 36 hours after dosing, remained on this level until 84 hours 
after  dosing  and  decreased  thereafter.  Pre-dose  level  of  ANC  was  reached  again  on  Day  18.  Mean 
glucose  decreased  until  48  hours  after  dosing,  increased  thereafter  and  reached  pre-dose level  again 
on Day 15. 
Other  laboratory  AEs  reported  by  more  than  2%  of  subjects  in  any  group  were  increases  in:  ALT, 
creatine phosphokinase, C-reactive protein, GGT, AST, and blood bilirubin, as well as haematuria. 
In  Study  B12019-102,  two  subjects  discontinued  due  to  increased  ALT.  In  all  other  subjects,  AEs  of 
ALT, AST and GGT were mild to moderate, reversible, and did not require intervention. 
Vital signs and physical examination 
Blood  pressure,  pulse  rate,  respiratory  rate  and  tympanic  temperature  were  measured  at  screening, 
pre-dose  on  Day  1,  several  times  post-dose  in  each  period  and  at  the  follow-up,  after  at  least  5 
minutes  rest  in  supine  position.  Physical  examination  was  performed  during  screening,  at  admission 
and during the follow-up examination.  
In both studies, mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and 
body  temperature  showed  no  clinically  relevant  changes  after  dosing  with  study  drug  or  differences 
between treatments. 
ECG 
In study B12019-101, electrocardiograms were recorded at screening, before and after dosing and at 
the  follow-up.  In  study  B12019-102  Electrocardiograms  were  recorded  at  screening,  on  Day  -1  and 
prior to discharge on Days 5 of each period and on Day 43 of period 3. All 12-lead ECGs were normal 
or  abnormal  without  clinical  significance  in  both  studies,  except  for  one  subject,  who  suffered  from 
tachycardia before study drug administration in study B12019-101. Thus, this subject was not treated 
with study drug and not included in the safety population. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
Analytical methods 
A  multi-tier  test  strategy  (screening,  confirmatory  and  neutralisation  assay)  was  applied  to  evaluate 
relative  immunogenicity  of  Pelmeg  versus  Neulasta.  Identical  bioanalytical  methods  were  applied  to 
studies B12019-101 and B12019-102.  
Initially,  samples  were  subjected  to  a  screening  assay.  The  bridging  assay  format  used  biotinylated 
Pelmeg and Sulfo-TAG-Pelmeg as the labelled antigens, and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection 
of  solid-phase-bound  complexes  of  ADA  with  bridged  labelled  antigen  on  streptavidin-coated  MSD 
microtiter  plates.  An  in-house  prepared  rabbit,  affinity-purified,  anti-Pelmeg  antibody  reagent  was 
selected  as  the  primary  positive  control,  whereas  a  commercial  mouse  anti-PEG  IgM  antibody  was 
selected as a positive control for monitoring PEG reactivity in the ADA assay. Antigenic equivalence of 
the positive control (anti-Pelmeg) antibody for Pelmeg and Neulasta was demonstrated at LPC and HPC 
level using a single-assay format (with labelled Pelmeg antigen).  
Assessment report  
EMA/703393/2018

All screened positive samples were tested in a confirmatory assay in the same assay format using four 
different competitive inhibitors (Pelmeg, Neulasta, filgrastim (G-CSF) and PEG6000). Subsequently, titer 
values  were  determined  for  samples  that  were  positive  in  at  least  one  of  the  confirmatory  antibody 
assays.  
Lastly, all confirmed positive samples were tested using a neutralising assay format.

Study B12019-101 
Immunogenicity  was  evaluated  as  secondary  endpoint.  Subjects  were  dosed  once  with  6  mg  Pelmeg 
and once with 6 mg Neulasta. Blood samples for assessment of immunogenicity were obtained on Day 
1  pre-dose,  Days  8,  15,  22,  29  of  each  period  and  Day  43  of  the  last  period  for  detection  of  ADA 
formation. 
Overall, 34 of 171 (19.9%) subjects in the safety population had confirmed ADA positive reactivity with 
PEG; 9 of these 34 subjects also had confirmed positive ADA reactivity with Pelmeg; 7 of these 34 also 
had confirmed positive ADA reactivity with Neulasta. Of note, some of these subjects had only a single 
positive  ADA  sample  throughout  the  study.  No  filgrastim-reactive  positive  samples  were  detected  in 
any  subject  treated  in  study  B12019-101.  Thus,  the  detected  signals  appear  to  represent  antibodies 
reactive  with  PEG,  or  with  the  PEG  moiety  of  Pelmeg  or  Neulasta.  No  samples  with  neutralising 
capacity in the cell-based assay were detected. 
Overall 6 subjects were ADA positive (positive confirmatory assay of any of the 4 specificity cut points: 
B12019, Neulasta, filgrastim or PEG 6000) already prior to dosing in Period 1. Only 1 of these subjects 
remained  ADA  positive  throughout  the  study.  Until  the  end  of  Period  1,  15  subjects  who  received 
Neulasta and 18 subjects who received B12019 had at least one ADA positive examination. One further 
subject  was  ADA  positive  until  the  end  of  Period  2  (he  received  Neulasta  in  Period  1  and  B12019  in 
Period 2), i.e. overall 34 subjects had at least one positive confirmatory assay for one time point. 
The  highest  frequency  of  ADA  positive  subjects  was  on  Day  15  of  Period  1  (12  subjects  [14%]  each 
after Neulasta and B12019). Thereafter the number of ADA positive subjects decreased and on Day 43 
of  Period  2  overall  only  9  subjects  were  ADA  positive  (3  subjects  with  the  treatment  sequence 
Neulasta/B12019 and 6 subjects with the treatment sequence B12019/Neulasta, all PEG-positive).

Source: Integrated summary of immunogenicity. Pooled immunogenicity analysis  
A  higher  incidence  of  confirmed  PEG-reactive  antibody  signals  was  detected  in  Period  1  compared  to 
Period 2 regardless of treatment sequence (Integrated Summary of immunogenicity). ADA titers were 
relatively  low  (below  20),  consistent  with  the  detection  of  relatively  low  affinity  and/or  low  levels  of 
PEG-reactive antibodies in pre- and post-treatment samples in some subjects. 
Generally a higher incidence of PEG-reactive antibodies was observed in Period 1 compared to Period 2 
regardless  of  treatment  sequence.  An  analysis  of  PEG  positive  subjects  shows  that  there  are  many 
subjects  who  only  experienced  a  single  occurrence  of  PEG  positive  results  (14  subjects).  However, 
there are also many subjects who had PEG positive results for more than three consecutive time points 
(20 subjects).

Figure 17:  
Individual profiles over time for subjects with at least one ADA positive time 
point 
22 out of the 34 subjects were ADA positive at least two consecutive time points; these subject profiles 
are considered more relevant compared to the profiles of the subjects with only one ADA positive time 
point.  The  profiles  of  the  22  subjects  show  differing  patterns  and  do  not  reveal  a  consistent  trend 
regarding  the  treatment  or  treatment  sequence.  In  Period  1,  slightly  more  subjects  treated  with 
Pelmeg  were  ADA  positive  for  at  least  one  time  point  (Pelmeg:  12  subjects  with  46  positive  time 
points; Neulasta: 10 subjects with 39 positive time points). In Period 2, slightly more subjects treated 
with  Neulasta  were  ADA  positive  for  at  least  two  timepoints  (Neulasta:  8  subjects  with  29  positive 
timepoints; Pelmeg: 4 subjects with 16 positive timepoints). Subjects 24, 30, 32, 34, 56, 137, and 158 
were  consistently  positive  at  all  time  points  from  the  first  ADA  positive  timepoint  until  end  of  study. 
While subject 158 was already ADA-positive pretreatment, all other subjects where ADA-negative pre-
treatment.  6  subjects  were  consistently  ADA-positive  during  treatment,  being  balanced  across 
treatment  sequences,  with  3  subjects  in  the  treatment  sequences  Neulasta/Pelmeg  and  3  subjects  in 
the treatment sequences Pelmeg/Neulasta. 
Additionally,  a  frequency  table  was  generated  (Table  28)  which  shows  the  number  of  ADA-positive 
subjects  in  Period 1  by  the  number  of  consecutive  positive  time  points  to  assess  the  immunogenicity 
after single dosing without crossover.

The number of subjects with at least 4 consecutive ADA-positive time points in Period 1 was balanced 
between treatments, with 6 subjects after Neulasta and 5 subjects after Pelmeg dosing. 
Similar  results  for  the  2  treatments  were  observed  for  the  number  of  subjects  with  at  least  two 
consecutive ADA-positive time points in Period 1, with 10 subjects after Neulasta and 12 subjects after 
Pelmeg dosing. 
Table 26:

Study B12019-102 
In this study, the primary immunogenicity endpoint was proportion of ADA positive subjects at the end 
of Period 2, as detected by a confirmatory assay. The primary immunogenicity analysis was performed 
on the safety set, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the primary 
analysis,  proportions  of  ADA  positive  subjects  at  the  end  of  Period  2  were  calculated  and  presented 
with corresponding 95% CIs per treatment. Furthermore, the difference of proportions of ADA-positive 
subjects between treatments was calculated and presented with corresponding 95% CIs. 
Blood  samples  for  determination  of  ADAs  were  collected  on  Days  1,  8,  15,  22,  29  and  43  of  each 
period. 
The  analysis  was  based on  95  subjects,  as  one  subject  (020)  was  excluded  from  the  analysis  of  ADA 
frequencies.  The  respective  subject  had  received  an  incorrect  treatment  sequence  that  was 
incompatible  with  the  intended  study  design,  i.e.  repeated  administrations  of  the  same  treatment  in 
Period  1  and  2.  Two  confirmed  ADA  positive  samples  were  detected  in  Study  B12019-102,  both 
occurring  at  Day  15  of  Period  1.  These  had  a  minimal  ADA  titer,  with  no  filgrastim  reactivity  and  no 
neutralising capacity. 
In  Study  B12019-102,  the  3-mg  dose  level  was  chosen  to  correspond  with  a  dose  falling  within  the 
linear part of the PD response curve.

Impact of ADAs on pharmacokinetics 
The primary PK parameters, AUC0-last and Cmax, for study B12019-101, were summarized for the ADA-
negative  and  ADA-positive  sub-populations  (see  table  below).  AUC0-last  and  Cmax  were  found  to  be 
slightly increased (8 to 18%) in the presence of antibodies.

ADA  Negative  Subgroups  by  Treatment  in  Study  B12019-101  (PK  Set 
Excluding Subjects 118 and 138) 
A summary descriptive statistics for the positive vs. negative PEG-reactive ADA subpopulations for the 
PK response are shown in the tables below.  
For the positive PEG-reactive ADA subjects, the mean Period 2 AUC/Period 1 AUC was 92.5% for the 
TR  (Pelmeg-Neulasta)  treatment  sequence  (n=18  subjects)  and  84.2%  for  the  RT  (Neulasta-Pelmeg) 
treatment  sequence;  the  corresponding  ratios  for  the  negative  PEG-reactive  ADA  subjects  were 
104.5% (n=67) and 103.2% (n=70) respectively

In Study B12019-102, only 2 subjects were ADA positive.  
Impact of ADAs on pharmacodynamics 
In Study B12019-102, only 2 subjects were ADA positive.  
In  Study  B12019-101,  antibody  formation  was  primarily  directed  against  the  PEG  moiety.  A  slightly 
lower ANC response is seen in ADA positive subjects (n=34) with both the test and reference product, 
but  overall  the  mean  and  geometric  mean  values  for  the  AUEC0-last  of  ANC  were  comparable  for  the 
ADA  positive  and  ADA  negative  populations  in  each  treatment  group,  as  well  as  being  comparable 
across treatment groups.

As  pre-specified  in  the  study  protocol,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  in  the  subgroup  of  ADA-
negative subjects. In this subgroup (N=128), the geometric mean ratio of AUEC0-last was 100.89% and 
the  corresponding  95%  CI  was  contained  in  the  acceptance  interval  of  80.00-125.00%  (99.16%; 
102.65%). 
Safety in special populations 
All subjects in the conducted studies were male. No differences in AEs due to race between whites and 
non-whites have been studied. Elderly subjects were not included. Adverse event risk was analysed in 
the  subgroups  age,  weight,  BMI,  smoking  status,  and  ADA  status.  All  subgroups  were  similar  with 
regard  to  the  risk  for  drug-related  TEAEs,  indicating  that  there  are  no  relevant  differences  in  safety 
between subgroups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant did not submit studies relating to drug-drug interactions with Pelmeg (see safety 
discussion). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In each study, the majority of subjects completed the study as planned (95.3% and 87.5% in Studies 
B12019-101  and  B12019-102,  respectively,  based on  the  safety  population). No  subject  discontinued 
Study  B12019-101  due  to  an  AE.  In  Study  B12019-102,  four  subjects  discontinued  due  to  AEs.  Two 
subjects  discontinued  due  to  increased  ALT  (one  each  after  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta),  one  subject 
discontinued  due  to  lower  back  pain  after  the  second  dose  of  Pelmeg,  and  one  subject  discontinued 
due  to  increased  blood  pressure  after  the  first  dose  of  Neulasta.  There  was  no  imbalance  between 
treatments regarding the number of subjects with AEs leading to study discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  population  (all  subjects  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug)  in  Studies 
B12019-101  and  B12019-102  consisted  of  171  and  96  subjects,  respectively.  Subjects  in  Study 
B12019-101 were exposed to two 6 mg doses of study drug (one dose each of Pelmeg and Neulasta). 
Subjects  in  Study  B12019-102  were  exposed  to  three  3  mg  doses  of  study  drug  (T-T-R  or  R-R-T).  A 
total of 259 subjects received at least one dose of Pelmeg (3 mg or 6 mg); 46 of these received two 
doses.  A  total  of  260  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Neulasta  (3  mg  or  6  mg);  45  of  these 
received  two  doses.  Although  overall  safety  database  is  limited,  it  can  be  considered  sufficient  if 
comparability is demonstrated in terms of PK and PD and if no unexpected AEs are found. 
Overall,  the  most 
frequent  reported  TEAEs  were  back  pain  (78.3%),  headache  (43.4%), 
nasopharyngitis (32.2%), hypoglycaemia (29.2%) and pain in extremity (21.3%). 
Generally,  the  safety  profile  was  in  both  studies  comparable  for  both  treatments  apart  from  a  few 
exceptions discussed below: 
Notably higher TEAE frequencies after Pelmeg than after Neulasta were seen in Study B12019-102 for 
the  SOCs  “gastrointestinal  disorders”  (16.7%  vs.  4.2%)  and  “respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders”  (10.4%  vs  4.2%).  The  imbalance  in  these  SOCs  was  mainly  driven  by  subjective 
measurable  symptoms  and  signs  such  as  e.g.  nausea  (R:  1.0%  vs  T:  8.3%)  or  cough  (R:  1%  vs  T: 
6.3%).  The imbalances can be considered as chance findings. 
Overall,  no  death  occurred  during  the  two  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  A  total  of  4  SAEs  were 
reported in two studies, but were not related to drugs studied. No subject discontinued Study B12019-
101  due  to  an  AE.  In  Study  B12019-102,  four  subjects  discontinued  due  to  AEs.  There  was  no 
imbalance  between  treatments  regarding  the  number  of  subjects  with  AEs  leading  to  study 
discontinuation. 
The majority of subjects in both studies reported at least one TEAE, and in most subjects TEAEs were 
assessed as related to study drug. The frequencies and pattern of TEAEs were similar between Pelmeg 
and Neulasta, and in line with the SmPC for Neulasta. 
Local  tolerability  was  good  in  both  studies:  in  the  study  B12019-101  two  subjects  (1.2%)  had  mild, 
self-limiting, reactions at the injection site after administration of B12019, and in the B12019-102 only 
1  subject  in  each  treatment  group  had  mild,  self-limiting,  reactions  at  the  injection  site  after  study 
drug  administration.  Overall,  the  results  do  not  point  to  a  notably  higher  frequency  of  injection  site 
reactions with Pelmeg. 
The  observed  AEs  were  generally  in  line  with  the  SmPC  for  Neulasta,  except  for  the  observed  AE 
“hypoglycaemia”.  Drug-related  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  in  around  20%  of  subjects  after 
administration  of  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta.  The  decrease  in  serum  glucose  was  comparable  between  the 
two treatments. As hypoglycaemia was reversible, not associated with symptoms, and did not require 
intervention, hypoglycaemia can be considered to be of no clinical relevance. 
Therefore, there were no apparent imbalances between Neulasta and Pelmeg treatment regarding the 
number of subjects with SAEs. 
Analyses  of  glucose  results  by  study  period  revealed  no  relevant  differences  between  the  two  study 
periods. 
There were ADA-positive subjects with AE per treatment and by treatment period in the study B12019-
101.  Overall,  the  data  are  reassuring  with  similar  AE  occurring  after  Pelmeg  or  after  Neulasta  in  the 
ADA-positive subjects. No major differences are observed. Moreover, the pattern of AEs in the group of 
confirmed  ADA  positive  subjects  (N=34)  was  similar  to  the  pattern  seen  in  the  overall  safety 
population (N=171). Most common were events in the SOC of musculoskeletal disorders.

There  were  ADA-positive  subjects  with  AE  per treatment  and  by treatment period  in  studies  B12019-
101 and B12019-102. Overall, the data are reassuring with similar AE occurring after Pelmeg or after 
Neulasta in the ADA-positive subjects, and the AEs seen in ADA positive subjects were representative 
of AEs seen in the overall population.  
Immunogenicity 
Overall, a heterogeneous pattern of ADA-positive time points across subjects was observed. In Study 
B12019-101,  about  20%  had  ADA-positive  samples,  mainly  due  to  PEG-reactive  antibody  signals.  No 
antibodies against filgrastim or neutralising antibodies were detected for any of the 2 treatments.  In 
Study  B12019-102  two  confirmed  ADA  positive  samples  were  detected.  These  had  no  filgrastim 
reactivity  and  no  neutralising  capacity.  No  consistent  trends  regarding  treatment  or  treatment 
sequence  were  detected.  Based  on  the  individual  profiles  and  additional  evaluations,  no  consistent 
trends towards longer-lasting ADA-positive subjects after Pelmeg treatment could be observed. 
Although the immunogenicity is apparently low and no significant ADA emerged whatever the sequence 
tested  in  the  study  (Pelmeg-Pelmeg-Neulasta  or  Neulasta-Neulasta-Pelmeg),  formally  long-term 
immunogenicity  could  not  be  assessed  as  the  follow-up  period  was  maximum  18  weeks  and  the 
confounding  effects  of  a  cross-over  design.    Therefore,  the  proposed  approach  for  post-marketing 
collection of immunogenicity data (collection only for individual requests from physicians and reported 
via the standard pharmacovigilance reporting lines) is considered acceptable and is agreed by PRAC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No unexpected safety signals were observed with Pelmeg and no death occurred during the two studies 
in healthy volunteers. 
The safety profile of Pelmeg in both studies was comparable for both treatments and with the safety of 
Neulasta.  As  to  immunogenicity,  no  meaningful  differences  were  observed  across  treatment 
sequences. Generally, the observed AEs were in line with the SmPC for Neulasta.  
Therefore,  the  safety  data  overall  support  the  biosimilarity  of  Pelmeg  and  reference  product  EU-
Neulasta.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The  claimed  indication  is  identical  to  the  reference  product  Neulasta:  “Reduction  in  the  duration  of 
neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  adult  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic 
syndromes)”. Clinical studies supporting the application were carried out in healthy volunteers as part 
of the biosimilarity exercise. The clinical programme of Pelmeg comprised of two studies conducted in 
male healthy subjects.  
Clinical  comparability  of  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  was  established  in  a  pivotal  pharmacokinetic  (PK)/ 
pharmacodynamic  (PD)  study  using  the  approved  6  mg  dose.  The  study  B12019-101  (n=172)  was  a 
single-dose,  randomised,  double-blind,  two-stage,  two-way  cross-over  study,  which  assessed  PK  and 
PD as co-primary endpoints.  
The  supportive  study  B12019-102  (n=96)  was  a  multiple-dose,  randomised,  double-blind,  three-
period,  two-sequence  crossover  study  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  and  PD  comparability  of  Pelmeg 
and Neulasta using a non-therapeutic, lower dose of 3 mg.

3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality: 
For  the  biosimilarity  analysis,  the  applicant  has  performed  an  extensive  comparability  exercise  which 
included  several  batches  of  EU  Neulasta  and  several  batches  of  Pelmeg  DP  (including  both  process 
validation  and  clinical  batches).  All  quality  attributes  analysed  proved  to  be  highly  similar  between 
Pelmeg  and  EU  Neulasta.  For  a  few  purity  parameters  slight  differences  were  observed.  However, 
these  differences  were  very  small  and  are  not  believed  to  have  any  impact  on  the  quality  of  the 
product. As such, they do not preclude a conclusion on biosimilarity. The primary structure of Pelmeg 
was  found  to  be  identical  to  that  of  the  RMP,  with  identical  site  of  PEGylation  for  both  products. 
Molecular  weight  and  polydispersity  indicated  similar  PEG  moieties  between  Pelmeg  and  the  RMP. 
Moreover,  the  higher  order  structure,  product-related  variants,  and  the  impurity  and  aggregation 
profiles,  were  also  shown  to  be  similar  between  Pelmeg  and  the  RMP.  Furthermore,  relative  potency 
and  recombinant  human  G-CSF  receptor  binding  kinetics  were  similar  for  Pelmeg  and  the  RMP. 
Comparative  stability  testing  demonstrated  that  Pelmeg  and  the  RMP  degrade  in  a  comparable 
manner. In conclusion, the data of the physicochemical, bio-functional, and stability tests confirm that 
from a quality point of view Pelmeg could be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta.

• 
The non-clinical biosimilarity program comprised comparative assessment of in vitro PD effects 
as well as an in vivo PD/PK study. Biosimilarity of Pelmeg and Neulasta was demonstrated by 
comparative assessment of the binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor as well as of the potency 
to  stimulate  proliferation  of  myeloblastic  cells.  The  comparative  PD/PK  study  in  naïve  and 
neutropenic rats, although small group sizes, is considered supportive.  
Clinical: 
• 
Pharmacokinetics: the primary and secondary PK parameters AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax were 
assessed for bioequivalence between Pelmeg and Neulasta in study B12019 101 
•  Biosimilarity  in  pharmacokinetics  of  Pelmeg  with  EU-authorized  Neulasta  was 
demonstrated  in  the  pivotal  PK/PD  study  B12019-101  in  healthy  male  volunteers,  as 
the 94.32% CIs for the ratio of the test and reference product geometric means for the 
primary  and  secondary  PK  parameters  AUC0-last,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  were  fully 
contained within the standard BE acceptance interval of 80.00-125.00%.  
•  Study  B12019-102  was  not  intended  to evaluate  PK  equivalence  between  Pelmeg  and 
Neulasta. Although PK sampling was sparse, similar PK profiles were observed that can 
be considered as supportive for PK similarity between Pelmeg and Neulasta.  
• 
Pharmacodynamics:  ANC  and  CD34+  were  investigated  in  both  pharmacological  studies  in 
altogether 260 healthy volunteers (PD set) in a cross-over design.  
• 
• 
In  study  B12019  101  the  GMR  of  the  primary  endpoint  ANC  AUEC0-last  was  100.20%; 
the  95%  CI  with  99.16;  102.65  was  well  within  the  acceptance  interval  of  80.00-
125.00%. The secondary endpoints ANC Emax and t max, as well as CD34+ count which 
were only presented descriptively, were comparable. 
In  study  B12019  102,  where  a  lower  dose  of  3  mg  was  used  in  a  3  period  design  to 
assess  immunogenicity  and  PD,  comparability  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  was 
shown. The GMR of the primary endpoint ANC AUEC0-last was 101.59 with a 95% CI of 
99.58%;  103.63%.  Tighter  similarity  limits  of  90-111%  were  defined  post-hoc,  which

were easily met as well. The descriptively presented secondary PD endpoints Emax and 
tmax as well as CD34+ cell count support biosimilarity. 
•  No major safety findings were detected in the clinical part of the biosimilarity program 
or in terms of immunogenicity: 
•  Safety  was  comparable  in  both  studies  for  both  treatments  apart  from  minor 
differences.  No  unexpected  safety  signals  were  observed  and  no  death 
occurred  during  the  two  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  incidence  and 
severity  of  AEs  were  comparable  between  Pelmeg  and  Neulasta  in  general  in 
the conducted studies in healthy volunteers. The safety profiles observed were 
in general in line with the Product Information for Neulasta. 
• 
Incidence  rates  of  ADAs  were  equally  distributed  across  treatments  and 
treatment sequences in both studies. 
•  Across  the  two  clinical  studies,  no  confirmed  filgrastim-reactive  ADAs  or 
neutralising antibodies were observed. 
•  Subjects classified as ADA-positive showed no meaningful differences in PD or 
AE as compared to ADA-negative subjects. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity of Pelmeg and Neulasta. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk balance is derived from the reference product provided the totality of 
evidence  collected  from  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  package  that  support  the 
comparability of both products. 
From  a  quality  perspective,  the  critical  physico-chemical  and  functional  attributes  have  demonstrated 
that  Pelmeg  is  highly  similar  to  its  reference  product  EU  Neulasta.  A  few  minor  differences  were 
observed,  but  these  are  negligible  and  have  no  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  product  or  on  the 
conclusion of biosimilarity (at quality level).  
From  a  non-clinical  perspective,  the  requirements  for  biosimilarity  assessment  have  been  met  and 
sufficient evidence for the demonstration of biosimilarity has been provided.  
The  clinical  biosimilarity  program  consisted  of  comparative  PK,  PD,  immunogenicity  and  safety 
analyses  in  healthy  male  volunteers.  The  studies  included  only  healthy  volunteers,  which  are 
considered  a  homogenous  and  sensitive  population  to  assess  the  primary  objectives  of  the  clinical 
studies  and  were  in  agreement  with  the  scientific  advice  provided.  Biosimilarity  between  Pelmeg  and 
the  reference  product  Neulasta  was  demonstrated  in  the  clinical  studies,  as  the  primary  PK  and  PD 
endpoints  GMR  of  AUC0-last,  Cmax  and  ANC  AUEC0-last  including  their  confidence  intervals  met  the 
acceptance criteria. The secondary endpoints are also supportive of the biosimilarity exercise.  
The  safety  of  Pelmeg  was  consider  similar  to  Neulasta  in  both  studies,  no  unexpected  safety  signals 
were  reported  and  the  incidence  rates  of  ADAs  were  equally  distributed  across  treatments  and 
treatment sequences in both studies. 
Therefore,  considering  the  totality  of  the  evidence  on  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data, 
biosimilarity of Pelmeg with the reference product EU Neulasta can be concluded.

3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The  claimed  indication  is  the  only  indication  currently  approved  for  EU-Neulasta  (“Reduction  in  the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  for  malignancy  [with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic 
syndromes”]).  
Therefore no extrapolation to other indications is needed for this biosimilar application. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Pelmeg is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations

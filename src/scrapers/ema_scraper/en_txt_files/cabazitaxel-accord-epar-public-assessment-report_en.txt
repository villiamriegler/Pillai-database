2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application concerns Cabazitaxel Accord, concentrate for solution for infusion, 20 
mg/ml, in 3 ml (60 mg vial). 
This application is submitted in accordance with Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended 
(hybrid application). The originator and reference product is Jevtana 60 mg concentrate and solvent for 
solution for infusion. The MA holder of Jevtana is Sanofi-Aventis groupe, France. It was authorised in 
the EU on 17-03-2011. The difference between Cabazitaxel Accord and Jevtana is in the 
pharmaceutical form. 
Cabazitaxel Accord is supplied as a concentrate ready to be diluted into recommended diluents, 
compared to Jevtana with a 2-step dilution process. Jevtana is a concentrate for solution for infusion at 
60 mg/1.5 ml, supplied with a solvent vial containing 4.5 ml of a 13% w/w aqueous solution of ethanol 
(96 per cent) for the preparation of an intermediate premix at 10 mg/ml, prior to dilution with 0.9 % 
sodium chloride solution or 5 % dextrose solution in an infusion bag. 
Both Cabazitaxel Accord 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion (60 mg/3ml) and Jevtana 40 
mg/ml concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (60mg/1,5ml) contain the same active 
substance, cabazitaxel, which is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxane class. Cabazitaxel 
binds to tubulin promoting its assembly into microtubules while simultaneously inhibits microtubules 
disassembly leading to microtubules stabilization. It therefore promotes the disruption of the 
microtubular network in cells and by these means inhibits the mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
The applicant claimed the same indication as the one approved for Jevtana: Cabazitaxel Accord in 
combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen. 
The recommended dose of cabazitaxel is 25 mg/m2 administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg administered daily 
throughout treatment.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 20 mg/ml of 
cabazitaxel as the active substance.  
Other ingredients are: polysorbate 80, citric acid and ethanol anhydrous, as described in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
The product is available in a clear glass vial (type I) closed with a grey siliconized rubber closure (type 
I) with teflon film and sealed by an aluminium cap covered with a violet plastic flip-off cap, containing 
3 ml of concentrate, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cabazitaxel is (1S,2S,3R,4S,7R,9S,10S,12R,15S)-4-(acetyloxy)-15-{[(2R,3S)-3-
{[(tert-butoxy)carbonyl]amino}-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl]oxy}-1-hydroxy-9,12-dimethoxy-
10,14,17,17-tetramethyl-11-oxo-6-oxatetracyclo [11.3.1.0^ {3,10}.0^ {4,7}] heptadec-13-en-2-yl 
benzoate. It corresponds to the molecular formula C45H57NO14, its relative molecular mass is 835.93 
g/mol and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of cabazitaxel 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis (EA), 
mass spectrometry (MS), ultraviolet spectrometry (UV), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and 1H and 13C 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  
Cabazitaxel appears as a white or almost white slightly hygroscopic amorphous powder. It is freely 
soluble in dichloromethane, soluble in absolute ethanol, and insoluble in water.  
Cabazitaxel is obtained as amorphous form by the proposed manufacturer and process. Polymorphism 
of cabazitaxel is of no significance as the AS is used for the manufacture of injectable dosage forms. 
Results by X-RPD on four batches demonstrate that the manufacturing process consistently results in 
the amorphous form. A test for the amorphous form is included in the AS specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 9/27 
 
 
 
 
 
There are nine chiral centres in the taxol four fused ring skeleton and two chiral centres (2R, 3S) in the 
side chain of cabazitaxel structure. The four fused ring taxol skeleton is obtained by isolation from a 
natural source (taxus baccata leaves). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Cabazitaxel is a semi-synthetic compound derivative of the 10-deacetyl Baccatin III (called 10-DAB 
III), which is extracted from Taxus baccata leaves. The proposed starting materials have been justified 
and are considered acceptable. The synthetic process comprises 7 steps including recrystallisation. 
Critical steps were identified and a suitable control strategy has been defined. Acceptable specifications 
and analytical methods were provided for in-process controls and for the control of the intermediates.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. A 
discussion on mutagenic impurities was provided and in-line with ICH M7, potential mutagenic 
impurities are controlled according to the TTC of 1.5 µg/day considering a maximum daily dose of 25 
mg/m2. The impurity profile of the AS has been adequately described and impurities resulting from the 
manufacturing process of the starting materials do not carry-forward to later stages of the GMP 
process. No Class 1 solvents are employed in the synthetic process, whereas those, which are potential 
contaminant in the solvents used throughout, are adequately controlled in the raw material 
specifications of the respective solvent. 
Cabazitaxel  is  packaged  in  a  transparent  low  density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bag  inside  a  polybag  and 
placed inside a triple laminated bag with silica gel pouches and stored inside a high density polyethylene 
(HDPE)  drum.  The  primary  packaging  LDPE  bags  are  in  compliance  with  EU  Regulation  10/2011  and 
amendments,  as  well  as  Ph.  Eur.  3.1.3.  Satisfactory  specifications  for  the  packaging  materials  are 
proposed. 
Specification 
Cabazitaxel active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), 
solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC, XRD), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), 
specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), methyltrifluoromethane sulphonate content (LCMS), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), residual 
solvents (GC) and microbial limit (Ph. Eur.).  
The maximum daily dose (MDD) for cabazitaxel is 50 mg/day (25 mg/m2 and 2 m2 of body surface). 
Therefore, the thresholds required by ICH Q3A for reporting, identification and qualification of 
impurities in the active substance are 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15%, respectively. All impurities are 
controlled in-line with ICH Q3A and hence the proposed limits are acceptable. A limit for the potentially 
mutagenic impurity is included in the AS specification. The limit was set according to a TTC of 1.5 
µg/day and a MDD of 40 mg (corresponding to 25 mg/m2 and 1.6 m2 of body surface. As cabazitaxel is 
not considered to fall within the scope of ICH M7 and is only administered once every three weeks, the 
slightly higher control of this impurity is not considered to be of any safety concern. Residual solvents 
are controlled in-line with ICH Q3C. 
The analytical procedures have been sufficiently described. Non-compendial analytical methods have 
been successful validated according to ICH guidance. In-house reference standards are used to qualify

Page 10/27 
 
 
 
 
working standards of active substance and its impurities. Satisfactory certificates of analysis of 
reference and working standards of active substance and its impurities have been presented. 
Batch analysis results of three commercial scale batches comply with the proposed specifications. No 
significant differences in any of the tested quality attributes are observable. The levels residual 
solvents detected are well below the acceptable ICH limits. Overall, the batch analyses data 
demonstrates that the active substance can be manufactured consistently within tight quality margins 
Stability 
Stability data on four production scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5 °C ± 3 °C), and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% ± 5% RH) were provided according to the ICH 
guidelines. Stability studies conducted at 40 °C / 75% RH on one lab-scale batch demonstrated out-of-
specification results after 1 month for water content. Therefore, it was considered acceptable to 
conduct stability studies under refrigerated conditions for long-term storage. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  identification,  water  content,  specific  optical  rotation,  related 
substances and assay. The stability of the polymorphic form  was not investigated during the stability 
studies.  As  the  active  substance  is  fully  dissolved  during  manufacture  of  the  finished  product,  the 
polymorphic  form  is  not  considered  to  be  a  critical  quality  attribute  and  no  further  information  is 
requested. Upon the request of the CHMP bacterial endotoxins and microbial quality were included as 
quality attributes in the stability program.  
The test methods were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant changes to any 
of the measured parameters were observed under long term and accelerated conditions and all remained 
within specification. The stability of the polymorphic form was investigated during the stability studies 
and no conversion of the polymorphic form was observed.  
Stress testing, including photostability testing, has been performed under the conditions set in the ICH 
Q1B guideline, was conducted in solution (acidic, basic and oxidizing conditions), as well as solid state 
(heat and light). The highest degradation occurred under alkali and acidic conditions. Results from mass 
balance and peak purity demonstrate that the methods for assay and related substances are stability 
indicating.  The  AS  showed  signs  of  degradation  after  exposure  to  light  without  the  protection  of  the 
primary packaging material. 
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period of 24 months, with the special 
storage condition “Preserve in air tight, light resistant container and store at 2 to 8°C” in the proposed 
container closure system, is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Cabazitaxel Accord 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a concentrate intended for 
intravenous infusion after dilution with either 0.9% Sodium chloride solution for injection or 5% 
Glucose solution for infusion.  Each vial of 3 ml of concentrate contains 60 mg cabazitaxel.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 11/27 
 
 
 
 
Cabazitaxel Accord 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is an abridged application (hybrid 
application) to the reference product, Jevtana 60 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion. 
Each vial of the test product contains a total of 60 mg cabazitaxel the same as Jevtana. 
However, the test is a 20 mg /ml concentrate while the reference product contains 60 mg per 1.5 ml 
(i.e. 40 mg /ml) concentrate. Jevtana concentrate requires a further dilution with a solvent provided as 
a separate vial in the packaging and then a final dilution to the infusion solvent (not provided as part 
of the finished product). Cabazitaxel Accord requires only one dilution step directly into the infusion 
solvent (not provided as part of the finished product). For both test and reference products the 
concentration of the infusion solution should be between 0.10 mg/ml and 0.26 mg/ml (SmPC section 
6.6).  
Due to the differences in the pharmaceutical form (concentrate for solution for infusion vs concentrate 
and solvent for solution for infusion), concentration of the concentrate (20 mg/ml vs 40 mg /ml) and 
consequently in the SmPC instructions on Preparation for the intravenous administration (6.6) between 
the test and reference product respectively, the  issue of “medication error” has been raised as a major 
Objection. Therefore, upon the CHMP request, the issue was included among the safety concerns in the 
RMP, as an important potential risk. The applicant was also requested to propose risk minimisation 
measures associated with this risk (see section 2.5 and 4 in this report). In addition the colour of the 
flip-off caps (initially proposed green for Cabazitaxel Accord as for the originator) is changed to violet 
to avoid the potential product mix-ups and ease of use for the end user. 
The proposed composition of the concentrate is very similar to that of the reference medicinal product 
with respect to the excipients. The excipients selected are among the excipients present in reference 
product and are commonly used in parenteral formulation. The formulation has been developed 
considering the pH of the reference product on dilution. 
The active substance is practically insoluble in water. The applicant discussed the solubility of 
cabazitaxel in the components of the finished product. The data sufficiently supports that there are no 
concerns about the solubility of the AS in the proposed formulation. 
The essential similarity of the test and the reference product was established based on relevant 
comparisons of composition, pH, impurity profiles, micellar size, critical micellar concentration (CMC), 
in vitro release profile from the micelle for the final diluted solution of the reference product and the 
test product. The test and reference product (Cabazitaxel Accord vs Jevtana) could be considered 
“Similar formulations” in accordance to the Reflection Paper on the pharmaceutical development of 
intravenous medicinal products containing active substances solubilised in micellar systems 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/799402/2011), as they contain the same surfactant, and are qualitatively the same 
in the final solution for infusion. No BE-study was presented (see section 2.4 in this report on the 
acceptability of the absence of a BE-study). The CHMP requested additional comparisons of important 
micellar properties in accordance with the Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of 
intravenous medicinal products containing active substances solubilised in micellar systems 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/799402/2011). In this regard it has been sufficiently shown that the micelle size is 
comparable between the test and reference solutions. The applicant has also clearly demonstrated that 
the differences in micelle size were more instrument related, than product related. Data obtained on 
the same apparatus showed comparable sizes. Furthermore, the same concentrations are tested in the 
solution for infusion (as per the instructions of the SmPC). Consequently, it can be derived that the 
test and reference product have similar concentration of micellar entities. Hence, there are no concerns 
about the micelle size. 
It has also been shown that the [free] vs [solubilised] fractions of the active substance between the 
test and reference products after dilution using recommended dilution fluids as per the SmPC were 
found comparable for filtered and unfiltered solutions for both the conditions tested (8 hrs at 15-30°C

and for 48 hrs at 2-8°C), which indicate that AS remains in micellar system (solubilized form) over a 
recommended time interval and at recommended dilution concentration and storage temperature. Thus 
there is adequate data concerning the micelle component in solutions immediately prior to 
injection/infusion according to the dilution/administration instructions in the SmPC. 
In vitro data showed comparable in vitro dissolution between the two products and also the protein 
binding capabilities were comparable. Moreover, the fate of the micelles is supported by in vitro 
dissolution data and a protein binding study. These results support that the fate of the micelles is 
comparable between the test and reference product.  
Therefore, from a quality point of view, the conditions of the Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical 
development of intravenous medicinal products containing active substances solubilised in micellar 
systems (EMA/CHMP/QWP/799402/2011) can be considered fulfilled and a biowaiver is thus considered 
acceptable. 
A compatibility study was performed to evaluate the stability of Cabazitaxel Accord 20 mg concentrate 
for solution for infusion after dilution with the proposed solvents (0.9% NaCl Injection and 5% 
Dextrose Injection) in non-PVC bag with administration set at concentration of 0.10 mg/mL and 0.26 
mg/mL for a period of 8 hrs at 15-30 °C (under normal light) and 48 hours at 2-8 °C (protected from 
light) as per the SmPC section 6.6. 
The product met predetermined acceptance criteria for a period of 8 hrs at 15-30 °C and 48 hours at 
2-8 °C and it can be concluded that the dilution study results are comparable to that of the reference 
product Jevtana.  
In addition, as part of the compatibility study, it has been confirmed that drug crystallisation does not 
occur over a time interval relevant to the preparation and administration process and at the 
temperatures likely to be encountered in use. However, this has only been measured in samples of 18 
months old. As per the Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of intravenous medicinal 
products containing active substances solubilised in micellar systems, this study should be conducted 
using diluted infusion solutions prepared from undiluted samples during its shelf-life. Thus, a repeat of 
this study should be performed on samples at/close to the product end of shelf-life (36 months). The 
CHMP recommended to perform a micellar size distribution study on samples at/close to the product 
end of shelf-life (36 months) when samples of that age become available, as well as to discuss the 
clinical implications of the observed changes along with an appropriate action plan, such as the 
planned submission of appropriate variations. 
Furthermore, it is noted that although the number and level of impurities in the test product are higher 
than those in the reference product, the results remain within limits and the currently available 36 
months stability data does not show any trends for impurities formed. 
The manufacturing process was based on the development of an already developed medicinal product, 
nevertheless the presented information sufficiently supports that there are no concerns about 
crystallisation of the active substance. Also, the preparation of the slurry in the commercial process is 
also sufficiently addressed. Hence, it is acceptable that the description of the manufacturing process 
development was brief.  
As part of the manufacturing process development of the product a solubilisation of cabazitaxel in the 
bulk solution was conducted and showed complete solubilisation at process temperature. The choice of 
the sterilisation method has been adequately supported by data showing that the use of radiation, as 
defined in the Decision tree for sterilisation choices for dry powder products, non-aqueous liquid or 
semi-solid products in the Sterilization Guideline (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015), is not 
suitable for the proposed product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 13/27 
 
 
 
 
Hence, the choice of aseptic compounding is adequately justified. In addition, the type of filters (Filter 
Compatibility Study) has been investigated to check the compatibility of Cabazitaxel Accord in solution 
with the filters (including sterilizing grade filters) utilised in the manufacture of the finished product. 
The presented results support the suitability of the selected filters.  
Further studies confirmed the proposed bulk holding times and surface and tubing compatibility with 
process components. The container closure system was selected based on the reference product’s 
characterisation and based on stability data. 
Nitrogen sparging and headspace flushing is proposed as a result of a relevant study showing a steep 
rise in impurities when oxygen was used. 
A Freeze thaw study concluded that short term temperature excursion outside the proposed storage 
condition “Store at 25°C; excursions permitted between 15°-30 °C.” will not affect the product 
adversely. 
No overage is utilized. However, an overfill is proposed and justified based on the viscosity of the 
solution. 
Accordingly, the scalability of the process was studied, and all critical parameters were satisfactorily 
evaluated and the manufacturing process has been finalized. 
Leachables study results were presented for the rubber stoppers and glass vials as well as the 
employed filters and tubing. The results do not raise any concerns. 
The primary packaging is a 6 mL clear glass vial (type I), closed with grey siliconized rubber stopper 
(type I) with teflon film on plug surface and sealed by aluminium green coloured flip off seal. The 
finished product glass vial is further wrapped with PharmaShield which is a system consisting of a 
superficial plastic sheathing around the vial, going from the reinforced Non-PVC base to the vial seal. 
The glass complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 Glass containers for Pharmaceutical use and USP. The rubber 
stoppers used for the product comply with the requirements as mentioned in European Pharmacopoeia 
under Rubber closures for container for aqueous parenteral preparations, for powders and for freeze 
dried powders, Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 and USP. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Cabazitaxel Accord 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
consists of the following main steps: mixing of excipients and addition of active substance under 
nitrogen sparging, prefiltration, sterile filtration, vial filling, stoppering and sealing, visual inspection 
labelling and packaging. Due to the aseptic processing step, the manufacturing process is regarded to 
be a non-standard process.  The critical steps of the process were identified, and suitable in-process 
controls were presented for each identified step, i.e. preparation of bulk solution; prefiltration; sterile 
filtration; vial filling; sealing; and visual inspection. Details regarding the holding times of the 
unfiltered and filtered bulk solution during manufacturing of the product were provided. Sterilisation 
and depyrogenation methods of glassware and other heat-resistant container materials e.g. aluminium 
crimps, as well as the sterilisation method of rubber stoppers has been described and are deemed 
satisfactory. The presented information is deemed satisfactory and suitable to guarantee appropriate 
quality of the finished product. 
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated according to relevant European guidelines. 
Process validation data on the product has been presented for three full scale batches. This data supports 
that the manufacturing process is adequately under control in order to obtain a product that complies 
with the specifications.

Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), 
content of ethanol (GC), assay of cabazitaxel (HPLC),related compounds (HPLC), colour and clarity of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. 
Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The specification has been set in accordance to the relevant ICH 
guidelines. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product in line with the new ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities has been assessed using a risk-based approach. All the identified 
potential elemental impurities levels are less than the 30 % of Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) limits as 
per ICH Q3D Option 2B & hence no further control action/testing is required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  was  provided  for  three  commercial  scale  batches.  The  data  demonstrate  that  all 
parameters  are  well  within  their  specifications  and  therefore  indicate  consistent  manufacture  of  the 
finished product. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out on three commercial scale batches stored at long term conditions 
25±2 °C / 60±5% RH for up to 36 months and for 6 months at accelerated conditions 40±2 °C / 
75±5% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The tested batches were packed in the container closure 
systems intended for marketing and stored in inverted and upright position. 
Samples were tested for description, pH, ethanol content, assay, related substances, colour of solution, 
clarity  of  solution,  particulate  matter,  bacterial  endotoxins,  and  sterility.  No  significant  changes  were 
observed, and the results are found to be well within the specification limits.  
A photostability study was carried out as per ICH requirement on a pilot batch. The presented data 
showed that the finished product is sensitive to light. In addition, it has been shown that the proposed 
marketing package is able to protect the finished product from light. Consequently, the additional 
storage condition “store in the original packaging in order to protect from light” has been added to the 
SmPC section 6.4. 
A freeze thaw study was conducted including three thermal/freeze thaw cycles. No changes were 
observed in product quality. Hence it was concluded that short term temperature excursion outside the 
proposed storage condition will not affect the product adversely. 
In-use stability was investigated as part of product development and included compatibility of the 
diluted solution with tubing and materials used for administration. The results of in-use stability show 
that the product is stable when prepared in accordance with the instructions in the SmPC. The results 
on the oldest samples available at the time were presented. The CHMP recommended to perform a 
micellar size distribution study on samples at/close to the product end of shelf-life (36 months) when 
samples of that age become available and notifying the authorities if the product´s micelle size shows 
significant changes, as well as to discuss the clinical implications of the observed changes along with 
an appropriate action plan, such as the planned submission of appropriate variations. Based on the in-
use stability results, the claimed in-use shelf-life for the infusion solution as stated in SmPC section 6.3 
is accepted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 15/27 
 
 
 
 
Based on the overall stability data, the claimed shelf life of 36 months without any special temperature 
storage conditions but stored in the original package in order to protect from light, as stated in SmPC 
sections 6.3 and 6.4, is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of Cabazitaxel Accord 20 
mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing process for the finished product is non-
standard and the required validation data has been provided. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical 
performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-to perform a micellar size distribution study on samples at/close to the product end of shelf-life (36 
months) when samples of that age become available and notifying the authorities if the product´s 
micelle size shows significant changes, as well as to discuss the clinical implications of the observed 
changes along with an appropriate action plan, such as the planned submission of appropriate 
variations. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of cabazitaxel are well known. A 
non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need 
to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-
clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile 
was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are 
required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 16/27 
 
 
 
 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Cabazitaxel Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all cabazitaxel containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
However, this was not considered sufficient and, the Applicant is recommended to perform a 
calculation of the predicted environmental exposure using the consumption data as a justification for 
not providing ERA data (post authorisation measure). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific 
literature. It is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. The Applicant is recommended 
to perform a calculation of the predicted environmental exposure using the consumption data as a 
justification for not providing ERA data (post authorisation measure). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (60 mg/3 mL) containing 
cabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel Accord is different from the reference product Jevtana in the pharmaceutical 
form. Cabazitaxel Accord is a concentrate for solution for infusion while Jevtana is a concentrate and 
solvent for solution for infusion.  
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical development. 
No clinical studies were submitted. Since the product is administered intravenously, the Applicant 
claimed a biowaiver. The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel based on published literature. The 
SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.  
Due to a patent that was granted to the MAH of Jevtana for its use in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment, the relevant dose adjustment/reduction was removed from the SmPC and replaced with 
appropriate warnings and contraindication (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). 
Exemption 
Based on the intravenous route of administration of this medicinal product, a bioequivalence study is 
not required, as per the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1 Corr**) which states the following for parenteral solutions: 
“Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administrated as an 
aqueous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 17/27 
 
 
 
 
According to the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (‘Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence, CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**2010), micelle solutions for intravenous 
administration may be regarded as ‘complex’ solutions and therefore normally do not qualify for a 
biowaiver. However, in accordance with EMA/CHMP/QWP/799402/2011 “Reflection paper on the 
pharmaceutical development of intravenous products containing active substances in micellar systems” 
micelle formulations may be considered eligible for a biowaiver when certain conditions are fulfilled. 
These conditions included: (a) rapid disassembly of the micelle on dilution occurs and the drug product 
is not designed to control release or disposition, (b) the method and rate of administration is the same 
as the currently approved product, and (c) the excipients do not affect the disposition of the drug 
substance. In those cases, satisfactory data demonstrating similar physicochemical characteristics to 
the approved product could be regarded as sufficient and allow for a biowaiver. Consequently, in vitro 
characterization studies have been performed to prove its equivalence to the reference product, 
Jevtana. In the applied indication, cabazitaxel is administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion after 
dilution in a sterile container of either 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride solutions for infusion. 
Once diluted in an infusion solution, cabazitaxel is present in solution entrapped in the hydrophobic 
core of the micelles formed by the surfactant Polysorbate 80. In human plasma, the Polysorbate 80 
micelles are rapidly cleared as Polysorbate 80 is sensitive to dilution effects during intravenous 
infusion. It is rapidly metabolized and does not have a long half-life in plasma, as declared in the 
“Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of intravenous products containing active 
substances in micellar systems, EMA/CHMP/QWP/ 799402/2011”. 
The same phenomenon was observed for other drug products containing Polysorbate 80. The rapid 
esterase-sensitive breakdown of Polysorbate 80 in plasma is well known from the literature. 
Therefore, considering that: 
a)  Cabazitaxel Accord is not designed to control the release or the disposition of the active 
substance; 
b)  A rapid disassembly of the micelle on dilution occurs once it is administered in blood; 
c)  The method and rate of administration is the same for the test product and Jevtana; 
d)  The excipients do not affect the disposition of the active substance since: 
• 
the same surfactant/micelle forming system - Polysorbate 80 – in the same amount is 
present in proposed test formulation as in Jevtana; 
• 
small differences in the content are not likely to influence the capacity of the surfactant 
(polysorbate 80) to form micelles and thus its ability to solubilize the drug substance in 
the infusion solution (diluted solution); or to have a significant impact on the micellar 
stability or disposition of the drug in vivo, because of the extensive dilution in plasma 
upon administration; 
• 
the similarity in the in vitro characteristics of the micelle component & free and bound 
active substance was shown in the in vitro studies undertaken, 
the Applicant considers that demonstrating the comparability of micellar characteristics and the 
physicochemical similarity of Cabazitaxel Accord and Jevtana are adequate and sufficient to support 
the biowaiver claim. 
Clinical studies 
No clinical studies were submitted. Since the product is administered intravenously, the Applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/267872/2020  
Page 18/27 
 
 
 
 
claimed a biowaiver. 
2.4.2.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, micelle formulations may be 
considered eligible for a biowaiver in cases where for example the critical micelle concentration, the 
solubilisation capacity of the formulation, free and bound active substance and micelle size are similar 
between the reference product and the proposed product. The Applicant has submitted the results 
which support that the fate of the micelles is comparable between the test and reference product. 
Therefore, the biowaiver for the applied product is considered justified. The differences in formulation 
and concentration with the reference product raised concerns about potential medication errors. 
Therefore, additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product 
information. A DHPC at product launch was agreed. Additionally, regular 6-monthly safety updates on 
the cases of medication errors should be submitted (see RMP). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Since the product is administered intravenously, the Applicant claimed a biowaiver. No clinical studies 
were submitted. This was agreed. 
Due to a patent that was granted to the MAH of Jevtana for its use in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment, the relevant dose adjustment/reduction was removed from the SmPC and replaced with 
appropriate warnings and contraindications for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see SmPC 
sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Jevtana 60 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for 
infusion and Zoledronic Acid Accord 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The bridging 
report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a hybrid medicinal product, Cabazitaxel Accord (cabazitaxel, 20 mg/ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion). The reference product Jevtana (cabazitaxel, 60 mg concentrate 
and solvent for solution for infusion) is indicated in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for 
the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated 
with a docetaxel-containing regimen. The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable and 
consistent. The differences in formulation between Cabazitaxel Accord and Jevtana are in general fully 
and satisfactorily characterized by the published literature and comparative quality data required, and 
those differences are expected to have no adverse impact on the efficacy and safety of the proposed 
drug product. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary 
of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. 
The applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. The exemption from the necessity to conduct a bioequivalence 
study has been adequately justified. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
Due to concerns about potential medication errors additional risk minimisation activities are required 
beyond those included in the product information. A DHPC at product launch was agreed. Additionally, 
regular 6-monthly safety updates on the cases of medication errors should be submitted (see RMP). 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Cabazitaxel Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Cabazitaxel Accord in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel 
containing regimen. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

1.  Introduction 
Tasigna (nilotinib) 200 mg hard capsule was approved in the EU through the centralized procedure on 
19-Nov-2007  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  phase  and  accelerated  phase  Ph+  CML  in  adult  patients 
resistant  to  or  intolerant  to  at  least  one  prior  therapy  including  imatinib.  Subsequently,  Tasigna  150 
mg  hard  capsule  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  20-Dec-2010  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
newly 
diagnosed 
Ph+  CML 
in  CP.  More 
recently, 
on 
15-Nov-2017 
(Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000798/X/0088/G), Tasigna was approved in the EU for the treatment of paediatric patients 
with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  CML  in  the  chronic  phase  and  paediatric  patients  with  chronic  phase  Ph+ 
CML  with  resistance  to  or  intolerance  of  prior  therapy  including  imatinib.  This  approval  was 
accompanied by the approval of new 50 mg hard capsule strength. 
Tasigna  was  approved  in  Japan  on  21-Jan-2009  for  treatment  of  imatinib-resistant  chronic  myeloid 
leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase. Prior to the marketing approval in Japan, limited number of 
Japanese patients received Tasigna in clinical studies as part of Tasigna clinical development program. 
Therefore,  the  Pharmaceuticals  and  Medical  Devices  Agency  required  a  conduct  of  a  long-term 
observational  study  in  Japanese  patients  to  collect  safety  and  efficacy  data  from  all  patients  who 
received  Tasigna  after  its  launch  in  Japan  (Post-approval  measure).  This  observational  study; 
CAMN107A1401, was an uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in 
CML-CP  or  – AP  adult  and  paediatric  patients  who  received  Tasigna  as  of  16-Feb-2009.  A  central 
registration  system  was  adopted  and  all  patients  who  received  Tasigna  were  registered  and  followed 
for up to 3 year from the start of the administration of Tasigna. The registration period ended on 13-
Jul-2015  and  the  end  of  investigation  occurred  on  18-Jan-2019.  A  total  of  7  paediatric  patients  had 
been included in the study. 
On 11 July 2019, the MAH submitted documentation for the stand-alone submission of the data of the 
7 paediatric patients included in the CAMN107A1401 study, in order to adhere to the requirements of 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview has also been 
provided.

2.3.2.  Clinical study CAMN107A1401 
Description 
An uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in CML-CP or –AP adult 
and paediatric patients who received Tasigna as of 16-Feb-2009, conducted in Japan 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tasigna over long-term 
clinical use in patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase. 
Study design 
An uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in CML-CP or –AP adult 
and paediatric patients who received Tasigna as of 16-Feb-2009.  
In order to collect the data on long-term safety and efficacy of Tasigna in Japan, a central registration 
system was adopted and all patients who received Tasigna from the start of the study (16-Feb-2009) 
were registered. CRFs of all patients who received Tasigna were screened from 418 sites by the end of 
investigation occurred on 18-Jan-2019. 
Study population /Sample size 
728 patients were included in the efficacy analyses and 928 patients (CML-CP or –AP adult and 
paediatric patients) were included in the safety analysis including seven paediatric patients. Of the 
seven paediatric patients, four were boys and three were girls. 
Treatments 
Tasigna was administered orally and was available as hard capsule in dosage strengths of 50 mg, 150 
mg and 200 mg. The dose of Tasigna in paediatric patients was calculated based on body surface area 
(230 mg/m2 of Tasigna bid). The daily dose of Tasigna in paediatric patients ranged between 309.0 
mg and 800.0 mg (mean daily doses). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tasigna over long-term 
clinical use in patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
The  majority  of  patients  were  men  (56.25%)  and  43.75%  were  females.  Seven  paediatric  patients 
(<18 years) were included in this study (Table 2-1). All the paediatric patients (age range 7-15 years) 
were in CML-CP group (Table 2-1).

• 
The response rate (CHR) in the CML-CP hematologic response analysis population was 93.01%. 
Although it should be noted that the measures in this investigation are slightly different from 
the  data  at  approval  (Study  1101),  the  response  rate  was  comparably  high  to  the  response 
rate at approval (CHR: 100%). 
The  response  rate  in  the  CML-CP  cytogenetic  response  analysis  population  (major  CyR)  was 
75.45%  (complete  66.82%,  partial  8.64%).  Because  of  different  patient  characteristics 
including  the  presence/absence  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  and  a  considerable  number  of 
patients  not  evaluable  (81  patients),  a  simple  comparison  may  not  be  appropriate.  However, 
although the response rate was slightly lower than the response rate at approval (Study 1101) 
(major CyR: 93.8%, (complete 68.8%, partial 25.0%)), but the complete response rates were 
similar. 
• 
The  response  rate  (CHR,  MR/NEL,  RTC)  in  the  CML-AP  hematologic  response  analysis 
population  was  68.52%.  Although  this  investigation  and  the  Japanese  clinical  study  data  are 
slightly  different  in  terms  of  variables,  the  result  was  comparable  to  the  response  rate  at 
approval (Study 1101) (CHR: 71.4%).

The  response  rate  in  the  CML-AP  cytogenetic  response  analysis  population  (major  CyR)  was 
50.98%  (complete  39.22%,  partial  11.76%).  Because  of  different  patient  characteristics 
including the presence/absence of inclusion/exclusion criteria, a simple comparison may not be 
appropriate.  However,  the  response  rate  in  this  investigation  was  higher  than  the  response 
rate at approval (Study 1101) (Major CyR: 14.3%). 
In  the  paediatric  population  (<18  years),  the  complete  hematologic  response  (CML-CP)  rate  was 
100.0%.  The  major  cytogenetic  response  (CML-CP),  a  cytogenetic  response  measure,  was  also 
100.0%.  
Pediatrics (< 15 years) 
In this investigation, 6 pediatric patients (< 15 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the 
pediatric  population,  the  complete  hematologic  response  (CHR)  rate  was  100.0%.  The  major  CyR,  a 
cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0% (relevant parts of Table 15-9 & Table 15-10 included 
below). 
Pediatrics (< 18 years) 
In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (< 18 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the 
pediatric  population,  the  complete  hematologic  response  (CHR)  rate  was  100.0%.  The  major  CyR,  a 
cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0% (Table 15-9, Table 15-10). 
CML-CP hematological effects of adult (over 18) was 92.93% (617/664 cases) and CML-CPcytogenetic 
effects of adult (over 18) was 75.15% (490/652 cases). There is no difference between pediatric and 
adult.

Safety results 
In the overall population  
•  In  the  safety  analysis  population  (928  patients),  adverse  reactions  occurred  in  720  patients 
and the incidence was 77.59% (720/928 patients), which was not higher than the incidence of 
adverse reactions at approval (97.06%; 33/34 patients) in Study 1101. 
•  Common adverse reactions were platelet count decreased in 14.01% (130/928 patients), blood 
bilirubin increased in 12.28% (114/928 patients), lipase increased in 9.91% (92/928 patients), 
hepatic function abnormal in 9.05% (84/928 patients), gammaglutamyltransferase increased in 
8.84%  (82/928  patients),  anaemia  in  8.30%  (77/928  patients),  rash  in  7.97%  (74/928 
patients),  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  in  7.11%  (66/928  patients),  electrocardiogram 
QT prolonged in 6.79% (63/928 patients), white blood cell count decreased in 6.36% (59/928 
patients) and blood glucose increased in 6.14% (57/928 patients). 
•  All of these common adverse reactions in this investigation were already observed by approval 
(Study 1101) and thus expected events in clinical use. 
• 
The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  reactions  in  this  investigation  was  20.26%  (188/928 
patients). Common serious adverse reactions were platelet count decreased in 5.06% (47/928 
patients)  and  white  blood  cell  count  decreased  in  2.16%  (20/928  patients).  This  incidence  of 
serious  adverse  reactions was  not  higher  than  the incidence  at  approval  (Study  1101),  which 
was  35.29%  (12/34  patients).  All  of  these  common  serious  adverse  reactions  in  this 
investigation were already observed by approval (Study 1101) thus expected events in clinical 
use. 
• 
The  incidences  of  adverse  reactions  of  priority  variables  in  this  investigation  were  as  follows: 
cardiac  disorders  in  11.75%  (109/928  patients),  electrocardiogram  QT  prolongation  in  6.90% 
(64/928 patients), fluid retention in 8.94% (83/928 patients), interstitial lung disease in 1.29% 
(12/928  patients),  rash  in  18.21%  (169/928  patients),  haemorrhage  in  0.86%  (8/928 
patients),  infections  in  3.02%  (28/928  patients),  worsening  of  hepatic  impairment  in  53.85% 
(35/65 patients) and worsening of renal impairment in 21.74% (25/115 patients). 
• 
There  was  no  issue  to  note  about  adverse  reactions  in  patients  with  special  characteristics 
(pediatrics, elderly, pregnant women, hepatic/renal impairment).

Of the seven paediatric patients in this study, five patients (71.4%) experienced adverse events. The 
incidence  of  adverse  events  in  adults  (≥18)  was  77.6%  (714/920  cases).  One  serious  adverse  event 
(acne  pustular)  was  reported  and  no  deaths  were  reported  in  paediatric  patients.  All  the  adverse 
events  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  Tasigna.  Based  on  the  available  data,  no  differences  were 
observed in the safety profile of Tasigna in paediatric and adult patients in this study (CAMN107A1401) 
because most adverse events that occurred in paediatric were events that were generally observed in 
adults. 
Pediatric patients (< 15 years) 
In this investigation, 6 pediatric patients (< 15 years) were reported, of whom 4 patients had adverse 
reactions. 
The  following  adverse  reactions  occurred:  acne  pustular,  strabismus,  hepatic  function  abnormal, 
jaundice,  dry  skin,  rash,  chest  pain,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased,  electrocardiogram  QT 
prolonged and hepatic enzyme increased in 16.67% (1/6 patients) each. 
Pediatric patients (< 18 years) 
In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (< 18 years) were reported, of whom 5 patients had adverse 
reactions. The data on the occurrence of adverse events in the safety analysis population are shown in 
Table 15-6.

The  following  adverse  reactions  occurred:  Hepatic  enzyme  increased  (3  events),  Jaundice, 
Electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged,  hepatic  function  abnormal,  Rash  (each  2  events),  Dry  skin, 
Strabismus,  Headache,  Liver  disorder,  Bone  pain,  Acne  pustular,  Chest  pain,  Blood  creatine 
phosphokinase  increased  (each  1  event).  Only  acne  pustular  was  reported  as  serious  event.  7  cases 
were  reported  in  this  study,  and  71.43%  (5/7  cases)  occurred  adverse  events.  The  incidence  of 
adverse  events  of  adult  (over  18)  was  77.61%  (714/920  cases).  There  is  no  difference  between 
pediatric  and  adult,  because  most  adverse  events  that  occurred  in  pediatric  were  events  that  were 
generally observed even adult. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study  CAMN107A1401  was  conducted  in  CML-CP  or  –AP  adult  and  paediatric  patients  to  characterize 
the safety and efficacy profile of Tasigna, in line with the approved marketing authorization in Japan.  
The  information  provided  in  the  clinical  study  report  included  the  entire  study  population;  safety 
analysis  population  consisted  of  928  patients,  and  the  efficacy  analysis  population  consisted  of  728 
patients, i.e. adult and paediatric patients, and of these only 7 paediatric patients were included.  
In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (< 18 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the 
pediatric  population,  the  complete  hematologic  response  (CHR)  rate  was  100.0%.  The  major  CyR,  a 
cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0%. Compared to this the CML-CP hematological effects 
of adult (over 18) was 92.93% (617/664 cases) and CML-CPcytogenetic effects of adult (over 18) was 
75.15% (490/652 cases). There is no difference between pediatric and adult.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/590193/2019  
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only one serious adverse event (acne pustular) was reported in a 14-year-old patient, the event was 
reported to be related to Tasigna as per physician’s causality assessment. No new safety events were 
detected in the paediatric population treated with Tasigna. The safety profile observed in this study is 
consistent with the known and well characterized safety profile of Tasigna. The benefit risk assessment 
remains unchanged and positive.

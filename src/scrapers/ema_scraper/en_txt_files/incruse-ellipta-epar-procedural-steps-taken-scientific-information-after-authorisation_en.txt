The primary objective of the study was to report the 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final report from study 
WWE117397 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This was a retrospective longitudinal non-
proportion of patients with a possible off-label use and 
characterize them in new users of UMEC/VI, UMEC, or other 
LABD. The second objective was to quantify incidence of 
major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, mortality 
and pneumonia, and rates of exacerbations of COPD during 
follow-up in new users of UMEC/VI or UMEC. The tertiary

inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) or new

care setting. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
objective was in new users of UMEC/VI or UMEC with 12 or 
more months of follow-up following initiation, to describe 
treatment patterns and adherence. Despite the fact that 
several limitations were identified in data sources and did 
not allow to drawn sound conclusions for all the study 
objectives, the final report provides insight on UMEC and 
UMEC/VI utilisation patterns, including off-label prescribing 
rate of UMEC and UMEC/VI compared to other LABD in a 
primary care UK setting. Overall, the incidence of 
cardiovascular events and respiratory outcomes was as 
expected for these products classes, and no new safety 
signals were identified. Mortality rates reported in this 
study (using linked CPRD-HES-ONS) data are comparable 
to those reported using the same dataset for other LAMAs. 
The analysis of treatment patterns during the first 12 
months after initiating treatment with UMEC or UMEC/VI 
showed a good level of continuity for the majority of new 
users. No major difference in treatment patterns of on-label 
or potential off-label use for both UMEC and UMEC/VI users 
was noted in all groups. It can also be concluded that in 
this setting the analysis reveals a moderate level of 
adherence to UMEC and UMEC/VI treatment. Overall, based 
on the data reviwed no change to the product information 
was deemed necessary.

a 52-week study designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 compared with dual 
therapy of FF/VI 100/25 or UMEC/VI 62.5/25 in 
subjects with COPD. In addition, clarification on 
information related to the 24 week study submitted 
at time of initial authorisation is introduced in section 
5.1. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to update the 
frequency of constipation from ‘uncommon’ to 
‘common’. The Package Leaflet is updated in

The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one 
led to an update of section 5.1 to describe information that 
may be relevant for the prescribers to take decisions in the 
step wise approach to COPD management.  
Results from the IMPACT study do not allow ascertaining 
the exact contribution of Incruse/Rolufta Ellipta to the 
reduction in the rate of exacerbations. However the data 
are considered relevant from the clinical point of view 
taking into account the known correlation between 
exacerbations and morbidity/mortality. The following data 
added to section 5.1: In the randomised, double-blind, 52-
week study (CTT116855, IMPACT) of 10,355 adult patients 
with symptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more 
moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 
months, treatment with fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 99/55/22 
micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler was compared 
with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI 99/22 
micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler. The primary 
endpoint was annual rate of on-treatment moderate and 
severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMC/VI 
compared with FF/VI. The mean annual rate of 
exacerbations was 0.91 and 1.07 for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI 
respectively (Rate Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90; 
p<0.001). 
At Week 52, a statistically significant improvement in the 
least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in trough 
FEV1 was observed for FF/UMEC/VI compared with FF/VI 
(mean change: +94 mL vs. -3 mL; treatment difference: 
97 mL; 95% CI: 85, 109; p<0.001).  
In addition, clarification on information related to the 24 
week study submitted at time of initial authorisation is 
introduced in section 5.1 , in particular  information on the 
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severity of disease in the trial population studied in the 24 
week efficacy study, as well as information on the risk 
ratios and confidence intervals. 
Furthermore, based on the frequency reported in the 
IMPACT study, the frequency of constipation has been 
amended from ‘uncommon’ to ‘common’ in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. The Package leaflet is amended accordingly.

furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) (100/25 micrograms) once daily 
in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, resulted 
in statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvements in the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at 
Day 85 compared to placebo plus FF/VI (124 mL (95% CI 
93, 154, p<0.001) and 122 mL (95%CI 91, 152, 
p<0.001)). 
Improvements in lung function were supported with 
reductions in use of salbutamol over Weeks 1-12 (-0.4 
puffs per day (95% CI -0.7, -0.2, p<0.001) and -0.3 puffs 
per day (95% CI -0.5, -0.1, p=0.003)) compared to 
placebo plus FF/VI but improvements in SGRQ at week 12 
were not statistically significant (200109) or clinically 
relevant (200109 and 200110). The short duration of the 
studies and limited number of exacerbation events, 
preclude any conclusion regarding additional effect of 
Incruse on COPD exacerbation rate. 
No new adverse drug reactions were identified with the 
addition of Incruse to FF/VI in these studies.

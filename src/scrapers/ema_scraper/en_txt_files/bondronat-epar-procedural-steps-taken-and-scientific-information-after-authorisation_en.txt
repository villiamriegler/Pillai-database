Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
to add angiogenesis inhibitors as a risk factor for 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. The Worksharing applicant 
(WSA) also took the opportunity to implement the 
PRAC recommendation related to osteonecrosis of 
the external auditory canal (SDA030 for Bondronat 
and SDA036 for Bonviva). The Package Leaflet is 
reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in association with 
long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of 
the external auditory canal include steroid use and 
chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or 
trauma. The possibility of osteonecrosis of the external 
auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including 
chronic ear infections.

SmPC, Annex 
The MAH has undertaken an evaluation of a safety signal, 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) with information on 
II, Labelling 
taking into account a search for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid 
anaphylactic reaction/shock as follows: 
- Bondronat 2 mg/2 ml and 6 mg/6 ml concentrate 
for solution for infusion (only) :  Update of SmPC 
section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for 
use” of the SmPC and of Package Leaflet section 2 to 
add a warning and precautions statement regarding 
anaphylactic reaction/shock. 
- Bondronat 50 mg film-coated tablets and 2 mg/2 
ml and 6 mg/6 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion :  Update of SmPC section 4.8 “Undesirable 
effects”  and of Package Leaflet section 4  to include 
safety information on anaphylactic reaction/shock. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following 
obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore 
recommends its deletion from the Annex II: “The 
MAH should submit an updated Risk Management 
Plan reflecting “atypical femoral fractures” as 
potential risk. The Risk Management plan should be 
submitted by 6 October 2011.” 
In addition, the product information annexes were 
aligned with the latest version of the new QRD 
template (version 8.1) and the SmPC guideline,  and 
editorial corrections as well as linguistic corrections 
(in BG, DK, EL, ES, IS, LV, NL, PT, RO, SL) were 
implemented. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
and PL 
shock conditions and anaphylactic reaction in the Roche 
safety database, containing all serious adverse events from 
clinical trials of its ibandronate products Bonviva, Bondenza 
and Bondronat (irrespective of reporter causality 
assessment) and all spontaneous reports of adverse events 
from countries where these drugs are marketed.  A 
literature search and search of the UK General Practice 
Research Database (GPRD) was also performed. Based on 
analysis of all safety data generated, the MAH proposed to 
update sections 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for 
use”and 4.8 of  the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) with information on anaphylactic reaction/shock. In 
SmPC section 4.4 of the SmPC of the presentations for 
intravenus administration a warning and precautions 
statement was added:Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, 
including fatal events, have been reported in patients 
treated with intravenous ibandronic acid. Appropriate 
medical support and monitoring measures should be readily 
available when intravenous injection is administered. If 
anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic 
reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and 
initiate appropriate treatment. In SmPC section 4.8 safety 
information was added to inform that cases of anaphylactic 
reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported 
in patients treated with intravenous ibandronic acid. The 
Package leaflet was amended accordingly.

Results of a pharmacokinetic open-label, single centre, 
recommendations for patients with moderate renal

with different grades of renal impairment. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
non-randomised, parallel group study in subjects with 
varying degrees of renal function were submitted. In 
subjects with mild renal impairment no clinically meaningful 
increase in exposure was found.  In subjects with moderate 
and severe renal impairment, AUC exposure increased by 
86 and 110%, respectively. The i.v. data were extrapolated 
(based on the estimation of cumulative AUC's assuming a 
40% increase in AUC according to a regression model) to 
provide dosing recommendations for the oral formulation. 
The SPC posology section (4.2) is amended to add a 
recommendation for dose reduction in patients with 
moderate renal impairment: 
- from 6 mg to 4 mg (concentrate for solution for infusion) 
- from one 50 mg film-coated tablet every day to one 50 
mg film-coated tablet every second day  
Dosing recommendations for patients with severe renal 
impairment had been previously assessed by the CHMP and 
remain valid.  
The SPC section 5.2 and the package leaflet are amended 
accordingly.

3-4 weeks) from 60 minutes to at least 15 minutes in 
patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. 
The application is based on the results of one international, 
randomized, multicenter safety study (ML17632). In this 
study, ibandronic acid (6 mg) was administered either as a 
15 minute infusion (n=101) or as an infusion over 60 
minutes (n=26) every 3-4 weeks for 6 months. The safety 
profile of patients who received the 15 minute infusion was 
compared with that of the known safety profile for 
ibandronic acid. Renal safety of ibandronic acid was 
determined based on the change from baseline of a number 
of biochemical indicators of renal function 
Only two patients experienced an increase in serum 
creatinine of  3 44.2 mmol/L from baseline. Although both 
patients were receiving the 15 minute infusion of 
ibandronic acid, their previous medical history or 
concurrent disease status were the most likely underlying 
reasons for the observed elevations in serum creatinine. 
The overall adverse event profile of ibandronic acid 
following the 15 minute infusion was consistent with the 
known safety profile over longer infusion times and no new 
safety concerns were identified relating to the use of a 15 
minute infusion of 6 mg i.v. ibandronic acid in the

1.  Introduction 
On  6th  October  2014  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (MS305)  for  Increlex,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the specific obligation SO 002.1 (Long term safety study). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Increlex and 
that  no  consequential  regulatory  action  is  required.  No  amendments  are  introduced  to  the  Product 
Information. 
2.  Scientific discussion

2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for:  Increlex  (Mecasermin  (Rdna  Origin)  Injection)  Growth  Forum 
Database-IGFG Registry: A Patient Registry For Monitoring Long-Term Safety And Efficacy Of Increlex. 
Study number: W-TG-52800-010/MS305. 
The United States Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Deficiency (US-IGFD) Registry was a retrospective and 
prospective  patient  registry  sponsored  by  Ipsen  Biopharmaceuticals,  Inc.  In  collaboration  with 
participating  health  care  practitioners,  this  observational  study  monitored  the  long  term  safety  of 
patients  treated  with  Increlex  (mecasermin  (rDNA)  origin).  The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  intended 
primarily to monitor the safety and efficacy of Increlex therapy in children with growth failure. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Study  MS305:  Increlex  (Mecasermin  (Rdna  Origin)  Injection)  Growth 
Forum  Database-IGDF  Registry:  A  Patient  Registry  For  Monitoring  Long-
Term Safety And Efficacy Of Increlex.  
Description 
This study was initiated voluntarily in 2006 by Tercica, Inc. after regulatory approval of Increlex in the 
US, as a noninterventional real world experience subject registry. The study was not initiated to fulfil 
any FDA post approval requirements, but to provide more data than was available in the NDA. 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful 
efficacy results, the  data from this study could not be analysed for efficacy. In addition, a very small 
number  of  subjects  were  treated  with  Increlex  for  the  US  labelled  indication,  although  it  should  be 
noted that the US labelled indication is very similar to the EU one.

As  a  result,  only  baseline  characteristics  and  safety  data  were  analysed  and  presented  herein. 
Consequently, this abbreviated Clinical Study Report  (CSR) does not  contain all the sections required 
by ICH E3 but does contain full safety data as requested by ICH. This is the final CSR of the US-IGFD 
Registry following its closure. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The study objectives were: 
• To obtain long term safety data for Increlex replacement therapy in children with growth failure 
• To obtain long term efficacy data for Increlex replacement therapy in children with growth failure 
Study design 
This minimal risk, phase  IV, multicentre, open label,  observational study  of the long  term safety and 
efficacy of Increlex treatment was open ended with the duration of Increlex treatment determined at 
the investigator’s discretion. 
The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  initiated  in  May  2006  and  closed  on  23  May  2014.  The  protocol  was  a 
retrospective and prospective patient registry originally sponsored by Tercica, Inc. (a subsidiary of the 
Ipsen Group). In collaboration with participating healthcare providers, the US-IGFD Registry monitored 
the long term safety and efficacy of children with growth failure treated with Increlex in the US. 
All  data  collected  were  from  the  patients’  medical  records,  which  were  recorded  as  part  of  standard 
medical  care.  No  additional  patient  procedures  or  activities  were  mandated  or  performed  during  this 
study. The data were captured using electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) via a secure website. Some 
data  were  mandatory  for  data  transmission  (e.g.  Increlex  dose,  height,  weight,  and  adverse  events 
(AEs)) but other data  were optional. Optional  data were  those  considered useful to the data analysis 
but which, depending on the standard of care at each site, may or may not have been collected at each 
visit  (e.g.  serum  IGF-1  levels),  or  may  not  be  available  to  the  investigator  (e.g.  gestational  age  at 
birth).  The  eCRF  provided  the  opportunity  to  report  the  occurrence  of  targeted  AEs,  other  important 
events considered to be related to Increlex administration and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful 
efficacy results, these data were not analysed and only baseline and safety data are presented. 
Study population /Sample size 
Patients entered into the US-IGFD Registry conformed to the following inclusion criteria: 
• Parents or legally authorised representatives were required to give signed informed consent and 
must have given signed Authorisation to Use and Disclose Health Information before any Registry 
related activities were conducted. Assent from the patient was also to be obtained where appropriate. 
• Patients receiving Increlex prescribed by a qualified practitioner were enrolled. 
No exclusion criteria were specified. 
This was a phase IV observational registry study. No formal sample size and power calculations were 
performed.

Treatments 
Increlex was prescribed by a qualified physician according to the individual need of a patient. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety assessments, performed at the follow up, end of therapy and post-treatment visits consisted of: 
• Serious AEs 
•  All  targeted  AEs  (asymptomatic  papilloedema,  acromegalic  facial  changes,  oedema,  gynecomastia, 
hearing 
loss,  headache,  hypoglycaemia, 
intracranial  hypertension  (other  than  asymptomatic 
papilloedema),  lipohypertrophy  at  injection  site,  myalgia,  otitis  media,  sleep  apnoea,  tonsillar 
hypertrophy, urticaria and injection site reaction) 
• Other significant non serious AEs 
• Non serious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
• Increlex exposure 
Targeted  AEs  were  AEs  of  special  interest  based  on  clinical  trials  and  research  related  to  PIGFD  and 
data  were  therefore  sought  proactively.  The  occurrence  of  each  targeted  AE,  other  significant 
nonserious AEs and nonserious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported at each visit 
as ‘yes/no.’ No start or stop dates were collected for these AEs. Relationship to treatment, severity of 
the  AE,  outcome  and  action  taken  regarding  Increlex  treatment  were  only  reported  for  SAEs.  All 
targeted AEs were considered related to treatment. 
Statistical Methods 
Detailed  methodology  for  summary  and  statistical  analyses  of  the  data  collected  in  the  US-IGFD 
Registry is documented in the Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) dated 20 May 2014. 
All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  by  the  biostatistics  unit  of  a  CRO  contracted  by  the  Sponsor 
using  Statistical  Analysis  System  (SAS®)  software  Version  9.2  or  higher  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary, 
North Carolina, US). The statistical analyses were performed in accordance with ICH E9 guidelines and 
were to be based on the pooled data from the individual US study sites, unless otherwise stated. 
Demographics,  the  results  of  the  IGF-1  generation  test,  GH  concentrations,  diagnoses,  previous 
therapy  and  the  results  of  genetic  tests  were  summarised  overall  and  by  gender  for  the  enrolled 
population. 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  each  type  of  AE  (targeted  AEs,  other  related  significant  nonserious  AEs, 
nonserious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and SAEs) were summarised with the number 
and proportion of subjects with at least one event classified by primary System Organ Class (SOC) and 
Preferred  Term  (PT).  The  number  of  occurrences  was  also  presented.  For  each  type  of  SAE,  severity 
and causality were described. 
Treatment  emergent  AEs (TEAEs)  were  defined  as AEs  with  onset  dates  within  31  days  following  the 
last  Increlex  injection.  Pretreatment  AEs  were  those  occurring  before  the  first  Increlex  injection  and 
post-treatment AEs were those occurring after 31 days of the last Increlex injection. 
Data were summarised for the safety follow up population and the safety post-treatment population.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
1377 subjects were enrolled from 114 active sites. 
Among the enrolled population, 1342 (97.5%) subjects were included in the safety population (fewer in 
number than the enrolled population, as this population comprised enrolled subjects with at least one 
follow up visit or any safety data collected during treatment follow up), 1339 (97.2%) subjects had at 
least one follow up treatment visit (safety follow up  population) and 164 (11.9%) subjects had  post-
treatment follow up data (safety post-treatment population). 
The  number  of  subjects  who  discontinued  and  the  reasons  for  treatment  withdrawal  are  and 
summarised in Table 3. In total, 804 subjects discontinued from the US-IGFD Registry, with 40 (5.0%) 
of these due to AEs. 
Protocol Deviations 
The  major  protocol  violation  that  occurred  during  the  conduct  of  the  study  was  lack  of  documented 
informed  consent  in  many  subjects.  Of  the  1377  subjects  enrolled,  678  (49.2%)  lacked  adequate 
documentation that signed informed consent had been obtained. Due to site closure ICFs could not be 
verified, and subjects from closed sites were counted as subjects lacking documented ICFs. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics of subjects in the enrolled population are and summarised in Table 4.  
There  were  more  boys  than  girls  (1047  (76.0%)  and  330  (24.0%)  subjects,  respectively).  The 
mean±SD age at first Increlex treatment was 11.0±3.6 years for boys and 9.8±3.5 years for girls. 
Thus, boys tended to be older than girls at first Increlex intake. 
At baseline (enrolment visit, Day 0), in boys, mean±SD height was 128.3±19.6 cm, mean±SD height 
SDS was -2.4±0.9 and mean±SD height velocity was 5.0±2.3 cm/year.  
At baseline, in girls, mean±SD  height was 120.6±19.3 cm, mean±SD  height SDS was  –2.6±1.1 and 
mean±SD height velocity was 5.2±2.2 cm/year.

At baseline, in boys, mean±SD weight was 29.0±11.8 kg and mean±SD weight SDS was -2.1±1.5.  
At baseline, in girls, mean±SD weight was 25.5±11.7 kg and mean±SD weight SDS was -2.1±1.5.  
With respect to Tanner stage, at baseline the majority of boys had pubic hair assessments indicating 
stages  I  (472  (74.8%)  subjects)  and  II  (95  (15.1%)  subjects).  The  majority  of  girls  had  pubic  hair 
assessments indicating Tanner stages I (146 (76.8%) subjects) and II (28 (14.7%) subjects).

With   respect   to   IGF-1,   in   boys,   the   mean±SD   serum   concentration   was 147.6±147.5 
ng/mL  (ranging  from  0.0-1565.0  ng/mL,  with  137  missing  values);  in  girls,  the  mean±SD  serum 
concentration was 177.9±195.5 ng/mL (ranging from 1.9-1293.0 ng/mL, with 49 missing values). 
With    respect    to    GH,    in    boys    the    mean±SD    basal    GH    concentration    was  4.4±13.9  ng/mL 
(ranging from  0.0-200.0 ng/mL  with  643 missing values) and  the  mean±SD  highest  stimulated GH 
concentration was 20.0±12.8 ng/mL (ranging from 0.1-131.0 ng/mL,  with  410  missing  values).   
In girls, the mean±SD  basal  GH concentration was 4.5±5.4 ng/mL (ranging from 0.0-29.1 ng/mL, 
with  218  missing  values)  and  the  mean±SD  highest  stimulated  GH  concentration  was  20.8±14.5 
ng/mL (ranging from 0.8-107.6 ng/mL, with 143 missing values). 
The range of values was wide and there were a large number of missing values. It should  be  noted  
that    GH    and    IGF-1    concentrations    are    dependent    on    age    and  pubertal  status  which  could 
account for the wide range of concentrations obtained.  
Diagnosis 
The most common primary diagnosis was primary IGFD (769 (73.4%) boys and 218 (66.1%) girls). 
These data also indicated that Increlex was being prescribed for other primary diagnoses, the most 
common being idiopathic short stature (207 (19.8%) boys and 79 (23.9%) girls). 
Measurements of Treatment Exposure 
Treatment  exposure  was  estimated  by  the  physician/study  coordinator  based  on  parent/subject  
reports. The data are and summarised in Table 12.

At  baseline,  the  median  dose  of  Increlex  administered  was  41.6  µg/kg  twice  daily  (BID)  in  boys  and 
55.9  µg/kg  BID  in  girls.  The  investigators  took  3-6  months  to  bring  subjects  up  to  the  maximum 
approved dose of Increlex (120 µg/kg given BID) instead of the recommended 2 weeks. A total of 804 
(58.4%) subjects permanently discontinued the treatment.   
Efficacy results 
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful 
efficacy results these data were not analysed and are not provided in this abbreviated report.  
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
The  extent  of  exposure  to  Increlex  is  summarised  in  Table  13.  The  mean±SD  duration  of  treatment 
with  Increlex  was  25.4±16.9  months  for  boys  and  23.6±17.4  months  for  girls,  and  was  therefore 
comparable between the genders. The  maximum duration of Increlex treatment was 80.1 months for 
boys and 76.2 months  for girls. The sum of duration of treatment with Increlex expressed in terms of 
subject  years  was  2151.5  years  for  boys  and  637.7  years  for  girls,  which  reflected  the  gender 
imbalance in this study.

The safety analysis is based on a safety follow up population of 1017 boys and 322 girls and a safety 
post-treatment population, which comprised 112 boys and 52 girls. 
Treatment emergent AEs recorded in the safety follow up population are summarised in Table 14. 
In the US-IGFD Registry, 371 (27.7%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total 
of 1256 TEAEs, of which 83 (experienced by 46 (3.4%) subjects) were serious TEAEs. With respect to 
targeted TEAEs, 667 events were experienced by 251 (18.7%) subjects, of which 13 (experienced by 
11 (0.8%) subjects) were serious targeted TEAEs.

In  total,  667  targeted  TEAEs  were  reported  for  251  (18.7%)  subjects.  The  most  frequent  targeted 
TEAEs  (affecting  more  than  1%  of  the  subjects)  were:  hypoglycaemia  (125  (9.3%)  subjects), 
headache (90 (6.7%) subjects), injection site  reaction (26 (1.9%) subjects), otitis media (22 (1.6%) 
subjects), myalgia (20 (1.5%) subjects), tonsillar hypertrophy (17 (1.3%) subjects) and injection site 
hypertrophy (16 (1.2%) subjects). There were 13 serious targeted TEAEs in 11 (0.8%) subjects. 
Serious  targeted  TEAEs  comprised  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (four  (0.3%)  subjects),  hypoglycaemia  (two 
(0.1%)  subjects),  otitis  media  (two  (0.1%)  subjects),  intracranial  pressure  increased  (two  (0.1%) 
subjects), headache (one (<0.1%) subject) and papilloedema (one (<0.1%) subject). 
Five  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (two  mild  and  three  moderate)  were 
reported in four subjects, with times to onset ranging from 111 to 1368 days after the start of Increlex 
treatment. These  events  were assessed as  serious as they involved hospitalisation  (two cases),  were 
medically  significant  (two  cases)  or  were  both  medically  significant  and  involved  hospitalisation  (one 
case).  In  four  cases,  the  drug  was  temporarily  suspended.  The  events  were  all  reported  to  have 
resolved in periods ranging from 1 to 129 days. 
Two  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  hypoglycaemia  (one  moderate  and  one  mild)  were  reported  in 
two  subjects,  with  times  to  onset  of  896  and  661  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment.  These 
events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  were  both  medically  significant.  In  one  case,  the  dose  of 
Increlex was reduced as a result of the event, with no action taken in the other case. Both events were 
reported to have resolved. 
Two serious Increlex unrelated cases of otitis media (both moderate in intensity) were reported in two 
subjects, with times to onset of 689 and 104 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events 
were assessed as serious as they both involved hospitalisation. In one case, no action was taken with 
respect to the study drug; in  the other case, the drug was temporarily suspended. Both events were 
reported to have resolved. 
Two serious Increlex related events of intracranial pressure increased (one moderate and one severe) 
were reported in two subjects, with times to onset of 88 and 67 days. These events were assessed as 
serious  as  they  involved  hospitalisation  (one  case)  or  were  both  life  threatening  and  involved 
hospitalisation (one case). Both of these events led to drug withdrawal and were reported resolved in 3 
and 136 days. 
One serious Increlex related case of headache (severe in intensity) was reported in one subject, with a 
time to onset of 207 days after the start of Increlex treatment. This event was assessed as serious as 
it was medically significant. The drug was temporarily suspended and the event resolved after 4 days. 
One serious Increlex related event of papilloedema (severe in intensity) was reported in one subject, 
with a time to onset of 118 days. This event was assessed as serious as it involved hospitalisation. This 
event led to drug withdrawal and was reported resolved in 1 day. 
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Deaths 
Two deaths were recorded during the study, both during follow up.  
Subject  1162  (aged  20  years  at  the  time  of  the  event)  experienced  sudden  unexpected  death, 
recorded  as  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  This  male  subject  was  aged  15.0  years  at  the  start  of 
Increlex  intake  and  had  been  treated  with  Increlex  for  PIGFD  for  2102  days  before  the  onset  of  the

event. The subject’s medical history included a familial risk factor of Laron  syndrome, Type I diabetes 
and hypoglycaemic episodes. The subject was not taking any concomitant medications. 
For Subject 2273 (aged 13 years at the time of the event), death was due to progression of sickle cell 
disease and recorded as being unrelated to study drug. This male subject was aged 11.7 years at the 
start  of Increlex intake  and had  been  treated with Increlex  for  idiopathic short  stature  for 1116 days 
before  the  onset  of  the  event.  The  subject’s  concurrent  conditions  included  sulphonamide  allergy, 
asthma  and  sickle  cell  disease,  while  his  past  medical  history  included  serious  events  of  fever  of 
unknown origin, hypoxia, Epstein Barr virus infection and infarcts.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
In the US-IGFD Registry study, 46 (3.4%) subjects experienced a total of 83 serious TEAEs during the 
study period. These are summarised by SOC and PT for the safety follow up population in Table 17.

hypertrophy  (four  events  experienced  by  three  (0.2%)  subjects  and  constipation  (six  events 
experienced by two (0.1%) subjects). 
A total of 83 serious TEAEs were experienced  by  46  patients during treatment with Increlex.  For five 
additional  subjects,  five  SAEs  of  graft  versus  host  disease,  osteonecrosis,  increased  intracranial 
pressure, pancreatitis and hyperplasia were reported more than 31 days after the last Increlex intake 
(post-treatment).  Of  the  83  serious  TEAEs,  49  (59.0%)  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity,  33 
(39.8%)  were  of  severe  intensity  and  one  (1.2%)  was  of  unknown  intensity.  For  10  subjects,  these 
serious  TEAEs  led  to  treatment  withdrawal.  Serious  TEAEs  that  led  to  treatment  withdrawal  included 
major  depression,  beta  haemolytic  streptococcal  infection,  IgA  nephropathy,  benign  intracranial 
hypertension  (three  serious  TEAEs  in  three  subjects),  increased  intracranial  pressure  (two  serious 
TEAEs in two subjects), papilloedema, sickle  cell  anaemia, condition aggravated, hypersensitivity  and 
convulsion.  
Treatment interruption occurred in 21 subjects due to 34 serious TEAEs. Among all serious TEAEs, 39 
(47.0%) reported in 24 subjects were considered related to treatment. 
The most common treatment related serious TEAEs were benign intracranial  hypertension (six events 
experienced  by  five  (0.4%)  subjects),  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (five  events  experienced  by  four  (0.3%) 
subjects), adenoidal hypertrophy (four events experienced by three (0.2%) subjects), hypoglycaemia 
(two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects) and spinal column stenosis (two events experienced 
by two (0.1%) subjects). Most of the 83 serious TEAEs had an outcome of ‘resolved.’ 
Related Serious TEAEs 
Six serious Increlex related cases of benign intracranial hypertension (one severe and five moderate in 
intensity)  were  reported  by  five  subjects.  The  times  to  onset  ranged  from  42  to  602  days  after  the 
start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were medically significant 
(five cases) or involved hospitalisation (one case). In three cases, the drug was temporarily suspended 
and  in  three  cases,  the  drug  was  withdrawn.  The  events  were  all  reported  to  have  resolved  in  time 
periods ranging from 2 to 1217 days. 
Four  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  adenoidal  hypertrophy  (one  mild  and  three  moderate  in 
intensity) were reported by three subjects. The times to onset ranged from 286 to 1368 days after the 
start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were medically significant 
(two  cases)  or  involved  hospitalisation  (two  cases).  In  three  cases,  the  drug  was  temporarily 
suspended. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 1 to 129 days. 
Four  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  constipation  (all  severe  in  intensity)  were  reported  by  one 
subject. The times to onset ranged from 1484 to 1641 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These 
events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  involved  hospitalisation.  In  one  case,  the  drug  was 
temporarily suspended, with no action taken in the other cases. The events were all reported to have 
resolved in time periods ranging from 2 to 3 days. 
Two  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  spinal  column  stenosis  (one  severe  and  one  mild  in  intensity) 
were reported by two subjects. The times to onset were 1872 and 2077 days after the start of Increlex 
treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were both medically significant. In one case, 
the drug was temporarily suspended. Both events were reported as ongoing. 
Two  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  convulsion  (one  moderate  and  one  severe  in  intensity)  were 
reported  by  two  subjects.  The  times  to  onset  were  21  and  645  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex 
treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they both involved hospitalisation. In one case, 
Rapporteur’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

the  drug  was  temporarily  suspended;  in  the  other  case,  the  drug  was  withdrawn.  Both  events  were 
reported to have resolved in 1 day. 
Serious Increlex related cases (one each) of skin reactions, abdominal pain, encopresis, eye swelling, 
nasal  oedema,  epiphysiolysis,  hypersensitivity,  haematuria  and  drug  hypersensitivity  (ranging  in 
intensity from mild to severe) were reported. 
The times to onset ranged from 38 to 1641 days after the start of Increlex treatment. 
These  events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  were  medically  significant  (five  cases),  involved 
hospitalisation (three cases) or resulted in persistent significant disability (one case). In one case, the 
drug was withdrawn, in five cases, the drug  was temporarily suspended and in three cases no action 
was taken. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 2 to 260 days. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Adverse Events Leading to Drug Withdrawal 
In the US-IGFD Registry, 40 (3.0%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total of 
49 TEAEs that led to drug withdrawal.  
Treatment  emergent  AEs  leading  to  drug  withdrawal  experienced  by  more  than  one  subject  included 
hypoglycaemia (four events experienced by  four  (0.3%) subjects,  with times to onset  of  between  31 
and  1062  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment),  intracranial  pressure  increased  (four  events 
experienced by three (0.2%) subjects, with times to onset of between 111 and 631 days after the start 
of  Increlex  treatment),  hypersensitivity  (three  events  experienced  by  three  (0.2%)  subjects,  with 
times  to  onset  of  between  9  and  641  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment),  benign  intracranial 
hypertension  (three  events  experienced  by  two  (0.1%)  subjects,  with  times  to  onset  of  between  43 
and 196 days after the start of Increlex treatment), acromegalic facial features or facial dysmorphism: 
two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of 1786 and 1994 days after the 
start of Increlex treatment), headache (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to 
onset  of  388  and  690  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment),  injection  site  rash  (two  events 
experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of 59 and 69 days after the start of Increlex 
treatment) and pain in extremity (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset 
of 195 and 1608 days after the start of Increlex treatment). 
Other Significant Nonserious Adverse Events 
In  the  US-IGFD  Registry,  179  (13.4%)  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  396  significant  nonserious 
TEAEs.  
The  most  common  significant  nonserious  TEAEs  (reported  in  more  than  five  subjects)  included 
arthralgia  (15  events  experienced  by  12  (0.9%)  subjects),  snoring  (11  events  experienced  by  10 
(0.7%)  subjects),  pharyngitis  streptococcal  (10  events  experienced  by  10  (0.7%)  subjects),  pain  in 
extremity  (nine  events  experienced  by  eight  (0.6%)  subjects),  dizziness  and  abnormal  hair  texture 
(each nine events experienced by seven (0.5%) subjects) and scoliosis (six events experienced by six 
(0.4%) subjects).

There  were  two  deaths  during  the  study.  One  was  recorded  as  sudden,  unexpected  death,  possibly 
related  to  the  study  drug  and  the  other  was  due  to  progression  of  sickle  cell  disease  and  was  not 
related to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 46 (3.4%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced 83 serious TEAEs during 
the  study  period.  The  most  common  serious  TEAEs  were  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  tonsillar 
hypertrophy,  adenoidal  hypertrophy  and  constipation.  For  10  subjects,  these  serious  TEAEs  led  to 
treatment  withdrawal.  In  total,  39  (47.0%)  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  24  subjects  were  considered 
related to treatment. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
A  total  of  40  (3.0%)  subjects  experienced  49  TEAEs  that  led  to  drug  withdrawal.  The  most  common 
TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  withdrawal  were  hypoglycaemia,  increased  intracranial  pressure, 
hypersensitivity and benign intracranial hypertension. Additionally, 179 (13.4%)  subjects experienced 
a total of 396 significant nonserious TEAEs. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH conclusion 
The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  a  retrospective  and  prospective  patient  registry  program  sponsored  by 
Ipsen  Biopharmaceuticals,  Inc.  This  observational  registry  was  initiated  in  the  US  in  May  2006  to 
monitor the long term safety and efficacy of Increlex in the treatment of children with growth failure. 
The US-IGFD Registry was closed on 23 May 2014.  
Efficacy  analyses  were  not  performed  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion 
criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful  efficacy  results  Only  safety  and  baseline  data  have  been 
presented. 
This  US-IGFD  Registry  study  included  1377  patients  enrolled  in  114  sites  (enrolled  population),  with 
the mean age at initiation of Increlex intake being 11.0±3.6 years for boys and 9.8±3.5 years for girls. 
Over  90%  of  patients  had  a  diagnosis  of  either  PIGFD  or  idiopathic  short  stature.  Overall,  27.2%  of 
patients had previously received growth promoting therapy. 
Overall,  667  targeted  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  251  (18.7%)  patients,  of  which  13  were  serious 
targeted  TEAEs.  The  most  frequently  reported  targeted  TEAEs  were  hypoglycaemia,  headache, 
injection site reaction, otitis media, myalgia, tonsillar hypertrophy and injection site hypertrophy. The 
serious  targeted  TEAEs  comprised  tonsillar  hypertrophy,  hypoglycaemia,  otitis  media,  increased 
intracranial pressure, headache and papilloedema. Increlex was generally well tolerated, with only 40 
(3.0%) patients having to stop treatment due to AEs. 
A total of 83 serious TEAEs were experienced by 46 patients during treatment with Increlex. These led 
to treatment interruption in 21 patients and treatment withdrawal in 10 patients. Of the serious TEAEs, 
39 were recorded as being related to Increlex treatment. More than half (59.0%) of the serious TEAEs 
were mild or moderate in intensity and most resolved. In addition, five SAEs were reported during the 
post-treatment period. 
Overall,  179  (13.4%)  patients  experienced  a  total  of  396  significant  nonserious  TEAEs.  The  most 
common  significant  nonserious  TEAEs  included  arthralgia,  snoring,  pharyngitis  streptococcal,  pain  in 
extremity, dizziness, abnormal hair texture and scoliosis. 
Rapporteur’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/433030/2015  
Page 20/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two  deaths  occurred  during  the  study;  one  (sudden,  unexplained  death)  was  recorded  as  being 
possibly related to study treatment. 
The overall AE profile observed in this population is consistent with the known safety profile of Increlex 
and  the  known  pharmacology  of  the  drug.  No  new  safety  signals  or  changes  in  Risk  Benefit  were 
identified after review of the safety data 
Rapporteur’s discussion on clinical aspects 
Increlex was granted the marketing authorisation under Exceptional Circumstances on 3 August 2007 
for the long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulin-
like  growth  factor-1  deficiency  (Primary  IGFD).  At  the  time  of  the  granting  of  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation,  it  was  not  possible  for  the  MAH  to  provide  complete  information  on  this  medicinal 
product. Several post-authorisation commitments were agreed with the CHMP for data to be provided 
as Specific Obligations (SOs) and Post-Authorisation measures. 
In order to get more safety and efficacy data SO 002 was established:  
The MAH should perform one long-term safety study where mecasermin treatment is initiated in early 
phase of childhood and continued to adulthood in order to investigate: 
• 
• 
long-term toxicity in patients undergoing developmental changes 
to evaluate possible occurrence of malignancies as well as other risks 
At that stage, the US-IGFD Registry was already initiated (May 2006) to monitor the long term safety 
and efficacy of children with growth failure treated with Increlex in the US.  
To  fulfil  this  SO  and  in  order  fulfil  the  regulatory  requirements  in  EU  the  MAH  established  an  EU 
registry (EU-IGFD) in 2007. 
During the 6th annual re-assessment (2013) the MAH stated that there were no patients, neither in the 
EU nor in the US registry, who meet all of the previous inclusion criteria.  
At the same time MAH proposed several amendments to the original SO 002 which were agreed with 
CHMP:  
• 
Obligation  redefined  to  end  when  100  patients  with  at  least  3  years’  instead  of  5  years’ 
exposure  to  Increlex  have  been  followed-up  for  5  years  since  completing  treatment, 
irrespective of final height 
• 
Long-term follow up of patients completing Increlex treatment in EU-IGFD only. 
In addition, during the 6th annual re-assessment the MAH informed EMA the  decision to close the US 
Registry  (20  MAY  2014).  Partly  due  to  this  the  finalisation  of  this  SO  is  estimated  by  2023  at  the 
earliest. 
The MAH has now submitted the results from the closed US-IGFD Registry.  
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful 
efficacy  results  these  data  were  not  analysed  and  only  baseline  and  safety  data  are  presented. 
However, in 71.7% of the patie 
nts  the  primary  diagnosis  was  primary  IGF-1  deficiency.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  clarify  the  number  of 
these  987 subjects who fulfilled the EU  indication for Increlex and the possibility to get efficacy  data 
derived from this population.

article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Page 21/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding safety, no new safety concerns were found.  
371 (27.7%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total of 1256 TEAEs, of which 
83  (experienced  by  46  (3.4%)  subjects)  were  serious  TEAEs.  The  TEAEs  in  the  safety  follow  up 
population are in line with the known safety profile of Increlex: hypoglycaemia was the most frequently 
reported  TEAE  (9.3%)  and  the  other  most  frequent  TEAEs  included  headache  (6.7%)  injection  site 
reaction  (1.9%),  otitis  media  (1.6%),  myalgia  (1.5%)  subjects),  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (1.3%)  and 
injection  site  hypertrophy  (1.2%).  These  AEs  are  all  also  targeted  AEs  associated  with  the  use  of 
Increlex and mentioned in the Increlex-SPC. 
The  related  serious  TEAEs  included  six  cases  of  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  four  cases  of 
adenoidal  hypertrophy,  four  cases  of  constipation,  two  cases  of  spinal  column  stenosis,  two  cases  of 
convulsion.  These  serious  TEAEs  are  also  associated  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Increlex  and 
mentioned  in  the  Increlex-SPC  (all  expect  constipation,  however  this  AE  is  considered  to  be  covered 
with AE ”abdominal pain”) . 
Two  deaths  were  recorded  during  the  study,  both  during  follow  up.  The  first  subject  experienced 
sudden unexpected death, recorded as possibly related to study drug. It seems that autopsy has been 
performed  but  the  outcome  of  it  has  not  been  reported  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  provide 
further clarification of the reason behind this death  since  at the moment it is not possible to exclude 
whether this death is related to use of the study drug or not.  The other death was due to progression 
of sickle cell disease and thus unrelated to study drug. 
In general, there were no new, unexpected TEAEs. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  current  MS305  study  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the 
Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as  amended.  The  study  was  carried  out  as  a  stand-alone  study  and 
provided  long-term  safety  information  from  the  US-IGFD-registry.  Unfortunately,  long-term  efficacy 
data  were  not  analysed  and  therefore  not  presented  for  evaluation.  Since  this  US-IGFD-registry  has 
been closed the data presented is the final data from this registry. 
Children were treated with Increlex prescribed by a qualified physician according to the individual need 
of a patient. 
The safety profile of Increlex in this study is in line with previous experience with Increlex and in line 
with Increlex SPC. 
This study does not have any impact on the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in its current approved EU-
indication. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Increlex remains positive.

Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications related both efficacy and 
safety  aspects  of  the  study  305  as  part  of  this  procedure.  (see  section  IV  “Additional  clarifications 
requested”)

Additional clarifications requested 
1.  Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide 
meaningful  efficacy  results  these  closure,  efficacy  data  were  not  analysed  and  only  baseline 
and safety data are  presented. However, in  71.7%  of the patients the primary diagnosis was 
primary IGF-1 deficiency.  The MAH is asked  to clarify  the number of these 987 subjects who 
fulfilled the EU indication for Increlex and the possibility to get efficacy data derived from this 
population. 
2.  Two  deaths  were  recorded  during  the  study,  both  during  follow  up.  The  first  subject 
experienced  sudden  unexpected  death,  recorded  as  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  It  seems 
that autopsy has been performed but the outcome of it has not been reported by the MAH. The 
MAH  is  asked  to  provide  further  clarification  of  the  reason  behind  this  death  since  at  the 
moment it is not possible to exclude whether this death is related to use of the study drug or 
not. 
MAH`s reply to the additional clarifications: 
Question 1 - Summary of the MAH’s response 
Efficacy  analysis  in  patients  enrolled  in  study  W-TG-52800-010/MS305  was  not  provided  primarily 
because  of  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide 
meaningful  efficacy  data.  The  low  number  of  patients  was  related  to  2  main  factors:  the  first  one  is 
related  to  problems  with  the  informed  consent  procedure  and  the  second  one  is  related  to  the  very 
small  number  of  subjects  treated  in  accordance  with  the  US  labelled  indication*.  It  should  be  noted 
that the US labelled indication is more restricted but very similar to the EU label**. In the EU label, the 
threshold of IGF-1 is -2SDS (equivalent to 2.5 percentile) instead of -3SDS for US label.  
In  study  W-TG-52800-010/MS305,  987  patients  have  been  enrolled  with  the  primary  diagnostic  of 
primary IGF-1 deficiency.  
As  requested  in  the  Rapporteur’s  Preliminary  Assessment  Report  (PAR),  the  MAH  has  clarified  the 
status  of  these  987  patients  by  selecting  patients  potentially  eligible  for  efficacy  analysis  with  the 
following criteria: patients who fulfilled the EU indication for Increlex and had signed off the informed 
consent.  To  be  in  line  with  the  efficacy  results  of  EU-IGF  registry  (study  2-79-52800-002),  the 
subgroup of naïve pre-pubertal patients was also selected among the 987 patients. This subgroup is of 
particular interest for efficacy to have unbiased efficacy data (assessment of height could be biased on 
patients who started puberty and who were previously treated for short stature). 
The results of the research were as follows: 
  Over  987  patients,  only  70  patients  responded  to  selection  criteria  at  baseline  (patients 
fulfilling  the  EU  indication  for  Increlex  and  with  a  signed  off  informed  consent),  including  39 
patients  naïve  pre  pubertal.  At  one  and  two  year,  the  number  of  evaluable  patients  were  56 
and 38 patients respectively (33 and 22 for naïve pre-pubertal) as shown in table below.

  Among the 917 patients non eligible for efficacy analysis, 
o  451 (49%) had not signed the informed consent, 
o  895 (98%) did not fullfill EU Increlex Label: 
-  Some  of  them  presented  only  primary  IGF1  deficiency  and  not  severe  primary  IGFD  (with 
height ≤ -3SDS and IGF1 < 2,5 percentile): 576 patients were not compliant with height SDS 
(<-3 SDS,  n=521) and/or with  IGF-1  SDS  (<-2  SDS,n=275).  Only  few patients (41) had GH 
deficiency. 
- For some other patients the data to classify the patients were missing: 319 patients have at 
least one missing data (mainly missing data on GH stimulation test to identify GH sufficiency). 
The  efficacy  analysis  in  the  EU  IGF-1  registry  (last  report  submitted  in  November  2013)  was 
performed  in  a  patient  sample  of  172  subjects  (registry  population)  including  96  naïve  pre 
pubertal  patients.  Efficacy  data  at  year  1  and  2  were  presented  for  138  and  88  patients 
respectively (62 and 36 naive prepubertal). 
Taking  into  account  the  number  of  patients  in  the  analysis  previously  performed  in  the  EU  IGF-1 
registry overall (172, 138, 88) and in naïve pre-pubertal patients (96, 62, 36), the MAH estimates that 
the sample size of patients eligible for efficacy analysis in study W-TG-52800-010/MS305 overall (70, 
56,  38)  and  in  naïve  pre  pubertal  (39,  33,  22)  is  too  small  to  provide  relevant  effectiveness 
conclusions. 
*: US Increlex indication: long-term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary IGF-I 
deficiency, defined as height and IGF-I SDS ≤ - 3, with normal/elevated GH or with GH gene deletion 
who have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH 
**:  EU  Increlex  indication:  severe  primary  IGF-I  deficiency,  defined  as  a  height  SDS  ≤  -3  and  basal 
IGF-I concentrations < 2.5th percentile, with GH sufficiency and exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-I 
deficiency 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  MAH  has  provided  the  efficacy  analysis  in  patients  enrolled  in  study  MS305.  Only  70  patients 
responded to selection criteria at baseline (patients fulfilling the EU indication for Increlex and with a 
signed off informed consent), including 39 patients naïve pre pubertal.

Page 25/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main reason for such a low number of patients (70/987) that fulfilled the selection criteria is the 
fact  that  patients  who  did  not  have  signed  informed  consent  were  excluded.  This  is  still  considered 
unfortunate.  Therefore  the  “real”  number  of  patients  who  fulfilled  the  selection  criteria  remains 
unclear.  The  MAH  has  previously  stated  that  it  is  not  possible  to  get  missing  informed  consents  any 
longer  afterwards.  If  this  is  the  case,  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any  meaningful  efficacy  conclusions 
from this US-registry-study.  
The  MAH  concludes  that  the  sample  size  of  patients  eligible  for  efficacy  analysis  in  study  /MS305 
overall  (70,  56,  38)  and  in  naïve  pre  pubertal  (39,  33,  22)  is  too  small  to  provide  relevant 
effectiveness  conclusions.  Because  of  the  above  mentioned  reasons  this  reasoning  is  acceptable, 
although with some hesitance and caution. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved.

Question 2 - Summary of the MAH’s response 
A complete case narrative for subject 1219-1162 is provided in Section 14 of the Clinical Study Report 
(pages 384 – 386). The narrative is provided below, with additional information obtained from review 
of the subject line listings and final amended autopsy report. In addition, the dosing regime has been 
tabulated for clarity. 
The final amended autopsy report states the immediate cause of death as ‘Sudden unexpected death’, 
with  other  significant  conditions  ‘IGF-1  deficiency  and  complications’.  No  specific  anatomical, 
microscopic or toxicological abnormalities sufficient to explain death were found at autopsy. 
SUBJECT US 1219-1162: Spinal column stenosis, Sudden death 
This 20 year old male subject with PIGFD was enrolled in the US-IGFD Registry on 10 Oct 2006, at age 
15  years  old.  The  patient’s  birth  weight  was  4.08  kg,  and  birth  length  was  44.5  cm.  Baseline  height 
was  106.1  cm,  with  SDS  -6.34;  baseline  BMI  was  17.14,  with  SDS  -1.23.  Genetic  testing  confirmed 
Laron dwarfism. 
The  subject's  medical  history  included  a  familial  risk  factor  of  Laron  syndrome,  insulin  dependent 
diabetes  and  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  The  subject  was  not  taking  any  concomitant  medications  at 
enrolment,  but  was  taking  ‘agents  to  block  puberty’  at  the  follow-up  visits  (12  Jan  2007  through  30 
Mar 2011). 
On  01  Nov  2006,  the  subject  started  treatment  with  Increlex  at  a  dose  of  120  mcg/kg  BID 
administered  via  a  subcutaneous  route,  for  the  indication  of  severe  IGF-1  deficiency  associated  with 
Laron syndrome. 
The following dosing regimen was received by the subject:

On 12 Oct 2010, the patient experienced non-serious adverse event injection site reaction. 
On  20  Sep  2011,  the  patient  experienced  non-serious  adverse  events  headache  and  injection  site 
reaction. 
On  28  Nov  2011,  the  subject  underwent  a  tonsillectomy  due  to  airway  obstruction  associated  with 
snoring. Following surgery the subject was required to use a positive pressure mask. It was reported 
that  the  subject  skipped  two  doses  of  Increlex  as  he  was  not  eating.  The  reporter  assessed  this  as 
possibly related to Increlex as lymphoid hyperplasia has been reported with Increlex use. 
On  17  Jan  2012,  the  Increlex  dose  was  increased  to  218  mcg/kg  BID.  From  08  Mar  2012  to  13  Jun 
2012, the subject received 11 mg Increlex BID. 
On 08 Mar 2012, the patient experienced non-serious adverse event headache. 
On 14 Jun 2012, the subject developed hypoglycaemia after injecting himself at 7 am without eating a 
full breakfast. The subject became confused and had a headache. The subject received treatment with 
intravenous glucose in response to the event. Following treatment, the subject went home and rested 
and the symptoms resolved. 
On 14 Jun 2012, the dose of Increlex was increased to 12 mg, BID. 
On  09  Jul  2012,  the  subject  underwent  a  lumbar  MRI  and  was  diagnosed  with  asymptomatic  spinal 
stenosis.  The  physician  did  not  provide  any  cause  of  spinal  stenosis.  However,  stated  that  spinal 
stenosis has been reported in subjects with Laron syndrome. No corrective treatment was reported. 
On 02 Aug 2012, the subject took his latest dose of Increlex at 9 pm and it was reported that he ate a 
normal  meal,  but  later  than  the  usual  time.  On  03  Aug  2012,  at  5:30  am,  the  subject's  room  mate 
found  the  subject  unresponsive  and  purple.  The  paramedics  and  police  were  called  and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, however, the subject could not be revived. 
The  autopsy  examination  was  inconclusive  in  regards  to  the  immediate  cause  of  death.  The  post 
mortem  vitreous  glucose  level  was  noted  to  be  10  mg/dL.  The  subject's  underlying  history  of  IGF-1 
deficiency  and  any  associated  complications  may  have  contributed  as  well  to  the  fatal  outcome.  No 
evidence  of injury, intoxication, infection or  other  pathological process  was found. The final amended 
autopsy  report  states  the  immediate  cause  of  death  as  ‘Sudden  unexpected  death’,  with  other 
significant  conditions  ‘IGF-1  deficiency  and  complications’.  No  specific  anatomical,  microscopic  or 
toxicological abnormalities sufficient to explain death were found at autopsy. 
The reporting physician considered the event 'sudden unexpected death' as severe. 
The reporting physician considered the events spinal stenosis, hypoglycaemia and airways obstruction 
associated with snoring to be related and the event sudden unexpected death to be possibly related to 
Increlex. 
The  events  of  sudden  unexpected  death,  airway  obstruction  associated  with  snoring  and 
hypoglycaemia were assessed by Ipsen as related to therapy with Increlex. The company commented 
that the autopsy examination was inconclusive with regards to the immediate cause of death. The post 
mortem  vitreous  glucose  level  was  noted  to  be  10  mg/dL.  The  subject's  underlying  history  of  IGF-1 
deficiency  and  associated  complications  may  have  contributed  to  the  fatal  outcome.  Since 
hypoglycaemia is listed, a causal relationship could not be absolutely excluded. Snoring with associated 
airway  obstruction  is  listed.  The  event  of  spinal  stenosis  was  assessed  by  Ipsen  as  not  related  to 
therapy  with  Increlex.  The  company  commented  that  this  condition  is  seen  in  people  suffering  from 
Laron syndrome.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided final amended autopsy report as requested by the CHMP.  In addition, the MAH 
has also provided updated case narrative for subject 1219-1162. 
The  MAH  concludes  that  the  autopsy  examination  was  inconclusive  with  regards  to  the  immediate 
cause  of  death  and  since  hypoglycaemia  is  listed,  a  causal  relationship  could  not  be  absolutely 
excluded. 
MAH`s  reasoning  is  acceptable.  Although  sudden  unexpected  death  is  always  considered  severe 
serious  event,  the  inconclusive  result  of  the  autopsy  does  not  confirm  nor  exclude  the  possible 
relationship of this death to use of the study drug. 
Conclusion 
Point is solved.

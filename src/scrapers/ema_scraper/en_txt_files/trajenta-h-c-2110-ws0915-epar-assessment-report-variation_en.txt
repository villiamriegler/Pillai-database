2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In August 2011, linagliptin (Trajenta) film-coated tablets 5 mg were approved in the European Union 
(EU/1/11/707) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approval of an indication 
extension was granted in October 2012 for the use of Trajenta in combination with insulin when insulin and 
metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
In July 2012, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of linagliptin and metformin (Jentadueto) film-coated tablets 
(2.5 mg linagliptin/850 mg metformin bid and 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin bid) was approved in 
the European Union (EU/1/12/780) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Approval of an indication extension was granted in January 2014 for the use of Jentadueto in combination 
with insulin when insulin and metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
With the present submission, the MAH was applying for the use of Trajenta as combination therapy with 
metformin and an SGLT-2 inhibitor and for the use of Jentadueto as combination therapy with an SGLT-2 
inhibitor. Because the applications for Trajenta and Jentadueto are based on the same set of clinical trials 
and analyses, the content of the Clinical Overview and the Summaries of Clinical Efficacy cover both 
products. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data has been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support this indication extension the company has also submitted an interaction study1245.30. This 
interaction study has been submitted previously during the clinical development programme for the FDC 
empagliflozin/ linagliptin EMEA/H/C/003833/0000. In this study it was shown that there is no  significant 
interaction between empagliflozin and linagliptin.  
Further in procedure EMEA/H/C/003833/0000 the company has shown that the FDC empagliflozin/ 
linagliptin used in studies 1275.10 and 1275.1 is bioequivalent with the mono-components in study 1275.3. 
Therefore the bridging of the results of study 1275.10 and 1275.1, with the FDC, to the  mono-components 
is appropriately justified. 
A short description of interaction study 1245.30 can be found below. 
Study 1245.30 
Study 1245.30  investigated the relative bioavailability of multiple doses empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin 
5 mg after concomitant administration compared to multiple doses of empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin 5 
mg administered alone to 16 healthy male volunteers  
The subjects received the following treatments:

The concentration of empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin were determined in plasma an urine samples. 
Further  DPP-4 inhibition was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of linagliptin and glucose 
excretion was analysed the glucose excretion was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of 
empagliflozin. 
The AUCτ,ss of empagliflozin  was similar when the drug was given alone and in combination with linagliptin 
but the Cmax,ss of empagliflozin was reduced by approximately 12% when the drug was given with 
linagliptin. Median tmax,ss of empagliflozin  was slightly longer when the drug was given with linagliptin (1.5 
h) than when given alone (1.0 h). The urinary secretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin was similar between 
the treatments.

Trough DPP-4 inhibition (E24,ss) was similar when linagliptin was administered with BI 10773 compared 
with linagliptin alone. Empagliflozin alone had no effect on DPP-4 activity.  (Table 2)

Urinary glucose excretion over 24 h was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of Empagliflozin. The 
mean (± SD) cumulative amount of glucose excreted in urine over 24 h (Ae0-24) was approximately 18% 
lower when BI 10773 was administered with linagliptin (54.8 ± 11.2 g) than when the drug was given alone 
(67.2 ± 14.6 g). When linagliptin was given alone, urinary glucose excretion was negligible. The rate of 
glucose excretion was also slightly decreased. The combination of 50 mg Empagliflozin  and 5 mg linagliptin 
q.d. was safe and well tolerated in all patients . 
The mild decrease of the urinary glucose excretion does not appear to be related to the slightly decreased 
Empagliflozin Cmax , as around t max,ss of Empagliflozin (1.5 hours) the decrease of the urinary glucose 
excretion rate was similar to other time-intervals. Furthermore, no change in total exposure of empagliflozin 
(AUC) was found after linagliptin co-administration. As the rate of glucose excretion is it is mainly driven by 
concentration gradient of blood glucose, other factors, such as disease status, meals and antidiabetic 
medication may have caused  the  small and  variable effect on the glucose excretion 
Therefore it can be concluded that no clinical significant interaction between empagliflozin and linagliptin 
was observed and that the drugs can be coadministered without dose adjustment. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Linagliptin (Trajenta) is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
inhibitor. Linagliptin lowers blood glucose by extending the half-life of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), 
which is secreted in response to a meal. GLP-1 lowers blood glucose by augmenting the glucose-stimulated 
insulin release and limiting glucagon secretion to slow gastric emptying and to induce satiety. DPP-4 
inhibitors are associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia because GLP-1 activity ceases when plasma 
glucose concentration falls below 55 mg/dL.

The combination of linagliptin with metformin provides treatment benefits by lowering glucose and reducing 
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) further than monotherapy with either component. Combining linagliptin 
with metformin in a fixed dose combination tablet simplifies the antidiabetic therapy by decreasing the 
number of tablets to be taken and should improve the adherence of patients with their antidiabetic 
treatment. 
Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter-2 
(SGLT-2), which is expressed in the renal proximal tubules and accounts for approximately 90% of renal 
glucose reabsorption. Inhibition of SGLT-2 decreases the renal reabsorption of glucose, thereby promoting 
glucose excretion in the urine with a consequent reduction in blood glucose levels. The mechanism of action 
of empagliflozin is independent of β-cell function and of the insulin pathway, which contributes to a low risk 
of hypoglycaemia. SGLT-2 inhibition is associated with weight loss and a reduction in blood pressure. 
Because linagliptin, metformin, and SGLT-2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control via different mechanisms, 
their combination represents a potentially therapeutic option for patients with type 2 diabetes. This 
assessment report provides an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety of linagliptin as add-on therapy to 
metformin and the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The optimum daily linagliptin dose of 5 mg was determined in dose finding trials of the linagliptin 
development programme. In the entire Phase III programme, linagliptin 5 mg once daily was shown to be 
safe and efficacious and is the approved dose. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The pivotal data on the efficacy of linagliptin as add-on therapy to empagliflozin and metformin in patients 
with type 2 diabetes was derived from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial 1275.10. These 
data were also submitted as part of the MAA for Glyxambi, the FDC of linagliptin empagliflozin 
(EMEA/H/C/003833). 
The efficacy analyses were conducted independently for each of the 2 empagliflozin background doses; 
1275.10(met+empa25) and 1275.10(met+empa10). The superiority of linagliptin vs. placebo as add-on 
therapy to empagliflozin and metformin was tested after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment in patients who 
met the HbA1c inclusion criterion (HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) following 16 weeks of open-label treatment 
with the corresponding empagliflozin dose on a metformin background. The analyses were based on a mixed 
model repeated measures approach (MMRM), using observed cases (OC), in which missing data were not 
imputed prior to the analyses, but handled directly by the analysis model itself. Sensitivity analyses, 
including an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which missing values were imputed by the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) technique, were also performed. 
Evidence of the long-term efficacy of the combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin as add-on therapy to 
metformin is provided by 52-week data from the factorial design trial 1275.1(met).

Methods 
Study 1275.10 was an add-on study that investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin as 
add-on therapy to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin and metformin (Figure 1). Patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control despite metformin background therapy were 
randomised to an initial 16-week open-label treatment period with empagliflozin 25 mg (empa 25 OL, study 
population 1275.10(met+empa25)) or empagliflozin 10 mg (empa 10 OL, study population 
1275.10(met+empa10)). Patients who met the inclusion criterion of HbA1c values between 7.0 and 10.5% 
after 16 weeks of open-label empagliflozin therapy on a metformin background were eligible for 
randomisation into 1 of 2 possible treatment groups in the 24-week double-blind period of each open-label 
patient population, following an additional 1-week open-label placebo run-in period: lina 5 (given as FDC 
empa 25/lina 5 or FDC empa 10/lina 5) or placebo (given in addition to empa 25 or empa 10). Within each 
study population, the hierarchical testing sequences were independent of each other. All patients continued 
treatment with metformin throughout the double-blind period.

Figure 1 Trial design Study 1275.10  
Study 1275.1 was a factorial design study conducted according to the FDA guideline on FDCs in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient glycaemic control despite diet and exercise (Figure 2). The 
study population 1275.1(met) included patients with a metformin background therapy and the study 
population 1275.1(naïve) included patients with no prior antidiabetic medication. In each population, after a 
2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomised into 5 treatment groups: FDC empa 25/lina 5, FDC 
empa 10/lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5. The superiority of each FDC in terms of reducing HbA1c levels 
was tested against its respective individual components after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment 
independently in each study population (primary endpoint). Efficacy and safety were evaluated over the 
entire 52-week study period. The study population taking metformin background therapy (denoted as 
1275.1(met)) is relevant for the current application and is presented in this document.

•  Study participants  
All Phase III studies included male and female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, insufficient glycaemic 
control despite diet and exercise counselling, a BMI of 45 kg/m2 or below, who were at least 18 years old. 
All patients in studies 1275.10, and 1275.1(met) were taking metformin as background medication. Patients 
were to take an unchanged dose of ≥1500 mg/day (or maximum tolerated dose, or maximum dose as per 
local label) of immediate release metformin for at least 12 weeks prior to screening (study 1275.10) or 
randomisation (study 1275.1(met)) and to continue at this dose throughout the duration of the study. No 
other prior antidiabetic medications were allowed within 12 weeks prior to screening (study 1275.10) or 
randomisation (1275.1(met)). Study 1275.1(naïve) included patients without prior antidiabetic treatment 
(defined as absence of any oral antidiabetic therapy, GLP-1 analog, or insulin for 12 weeks prior to 
randomisation). 
Study 1275.10 recruited patients with HbA1c between 8.0% and 10.5% into the open-label parts of the 
study. Patients who had insufficient glycaemic control, defined as HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.5%, after 16 
weeks of open-label treatment with empagliflozin monotherapy and who still met the entry criteria were 
eligible for the double-blind treatment period. Study 1275.1 recruited patients with HbA1c between 7.0% 
and 10.5% directly into the double-blind treatment period.  
Patients were not eligible to participate in any trial if any of the following criteria applied:  
•  Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia after an overnight fast during the open-label treatment period and 
open-label placebo add-on period (study 1275.10) or during the placebo run-in (study 1275.1)

and confirmed by a second measurement. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia was defined as a 
glucose level >270 mg/dL (>15 mmol/L) in the study 1275.10 and >240 mg/dL (>13.3 mmol/L) 
in study 1275.1  
Indication of liver disease, defined by serum levels of either alanine transaminase (ALT, serum 
glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]), aspartate transaminase (AST, serum glutamic 
oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]), or alkaline phosphatase above 3x the upper limit of normal 
at screening (all studies) or after the open-label period (study 1275.10 only)

Patients were also excluded from participation in any trial if they were drug- or alcohol dependent or 
intolerant to any ingredient of the trial medications or the background medication. Female patients could not 
participate if they were pregnant or breast feeding or if they did not use adequate contraceptive methods. 
Patients were also excluded from participation in a trial if they had any other clinical condition that would 
jeopardise their safety. Patients with impaired renal function, defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (MDRD 
formula) were not eligible to participate in the studies. Patients were not eligible to participate in any study 
if they had a history of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack within 3 months prior

Study 1275.10  
The objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin 5 mg (lina 5) 
compared with placebo, each administered as add-on therapy to empagliflozin (25 mg [empa 25] or 10 mg 
[empa 10]) and metformin, over 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), who had met the HbA1c 
inclusion criterion (HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10.5%) after 16 weeks of open-label (OL) treatment with empa 25 OL 
or empa 10 OL and metformin background treatment.

The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and of the FDC empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg 
compared with the individual components (empagliflozin 25 mg or 10 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg) given once 
daily (q.d.) for 52 weeks in treatment naïve and metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
with insufficient glycaemic control. The study was designed to show superiority of the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin FDCs over the respective dose of empagliflozin and linagliptin alone, which was 
analysed separately in treatment naïve and metformin-treated patients. The primary analysis was 
conducted after 24 weeks of treatment using data collected until the cut-off date 12 Feb 2013, and is 
presented in this report along with the final analysis after 52 weeks of treatment. The study population 
taking metformin background therapy (denoted as 1275.1(met)) is relevant for the current application and 
is presented in this document. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary 
The primary efficacy endpoint in all studies was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. In all studies, blood samples for the determination of HbA1c were 
to be taken at almost all trial visits. At the first visit in a particular trial, the blood sample could have been 
taken at any time during the visit, irrespective of fasting. At all other visits, the blood sample was to be taken 
before breakfast and before administration of the trial drug. The samples for all trials were analysed in 
central laboratories that held a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program Level I certificate.  
Key secondary 
The change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment was a 
key secondary endpoint in all studies. In all trials, blood samples for the determination of FPG were to be 
taken at nearly all trial visits, after an overnight fast and before breakfast and trial drug administration. The 
samples were measured at a central laboratory using validated assays.  
The change from baseline in body weight after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment was a key secondary 
endpoint in study 1275.1 and a further endpoint in study 1275.10. In all trials, body weight was to be 
measured on the same scale for each patient.  
The categorical efficacy response analysis for HbA1c (response defined as HbA1c<7.0%) after 24 weeks of 
treatment was a further endpoint in study 1275.10 and a key secondary endpoint in study 1275.1. The 
proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c values <7.0% following the 16-week open-label period was a 
further endpoint in study 1275.10. 
Additional 
Additional further endpoints are the change from baseline in HbA1c by visit over time, the change from 
pre-treatment in HbA1c after 16 weeks of the open-label period of study 1275.10, the change from baseline 
in blood pressure (BP) after 24 weeks, and use of rescue medication. Blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 
[SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) were to be measured after 5 minutes of rest in a seated position.  
Rescue medication could be initiated provided trial-specific criteria for hyperglycaemia were fulfilled. The use 
of rescue medication as an indicator of lack of efficacy was defined as either an increase in the dose of 
antidiabetic background medication above the baseline dose for 7 or more days or the use of additional 
antidiabetic medication for 7 or more days. In addition, patients who prematurely discontinued trial 
medication due to lack of efficacy and increased the dose of background medication or started additional 
antidiabetic medication on the next day were regarded as having taken rescue medication. The proportion of 
patients requiring rescue medication and the time to first use of rescue medication were calculated.

•  Sample size 
Trial 1275.10: 
The following effect sizes were assumed for the calculation of the sample size. 
• 
• 
Trial Population A (lina 5 added-on to empa 25+metformin): Effect of lina 5 vs. placebo: 0.5% 
Trial Population B (lina 5 added-on to empa 10+metformin): Effect of lina 5 vs. placebo: 0.5% 
Based on previous experiences with linagliptin, the difference in HbA1c change from baseline after 24 weeks 
was assumed for the purpose of planning the trial to be 0.5% for lina 5 relative to placebo and that the 
standard deviation (SD) of the differences was 1.1%. The alpha (Type I error) was assumed to be 2.5% 
(1-sided). 
The overall power for each dose combination is calculated in Table 4. The total number of randomised 
patients was calculated to be 103 per treatment arm to have 90% power to test the primary endpoint. 
Assuming a 7% loss of randomised patients from the final analysis set, 9 additional patients were to be 
randomised per arm. As such, sample size was 112 per arm. A total of 448 patients needed to be randomised 
into the double-blind period of the trial. 
Table 4 Overall power for each trial population 
Trial 1275.1: 
An effect size of 0.5% was assumed for the sample size calculation in this trial, with a standard deviation of 
1.05% based on previous experience with empagliflozin studies. The power for a hypothesis test of the 
primary endpoint within a population (naïve or metformin experienced) is summarised below: 
With a sample size of 130 patients, the power for testing the 4 hypotheses of FDC combination vs. individual 
components was to be 89% with a population, assuming the hypotheses were independent. Assuming that 
2% patients did not have an on-treatment measurement of HbA1c and they were not to be included in the 
FAS (full analysis set), the number of randomised patients was 133 to achieve the overall power of 89%. 
Therefore, a sample size for each treatment arm would be 266 (133 treatment naïve and 133 on metformin 
background therapy). Hence, for the 5 arms in this trial, 1330 patients were to be randomised in total, giving 
665 randomised patients per population. This sample size was considered as sufficient for the confirmatory 
evaluation of safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics.

•  Randomisation 
When a patient was confirmed eligible, treatment was assigned by a third-party phone/webbased system 
involving the use of an IXRS system. 
In trial 1275.10 patients were randomised to treatment at 2 different times during the trial. At Visit 2 the 
patient was either randomised to open-label treatment with empa 25 OL or empa 10 OL in a 1:1 ratio. 
After the open-label treatment period, the patients were randomised at a 1:1 (trial 1275.10) ratio to 
double-blind treatment. After the run-in period of trial 1275-1, patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 
ratio. 
Patient assignment to the treatment groups was determined by a computer generated random sequence 
using a block size of 4 (trial 1275.10) or 10 (1275.1). Access to the randomisation code was controlled and 
documented. Randomisation was stratified by 3 factors: 
• 
• 
Pre-randomisation HbA1c (<8.5% or ≥8.5%) using the Visit 4 HbA1c values. 
Pre-randomisation renal function (mild renal impairment: 60 ≤eGFR ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2 or 
normal renal function: eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2) using integer values of eGFR from the Visit 
4 creatinine values. 
•  Region (Europe, North America or Latin America). Patients from any sites in Australia were 
grouped with Europe for this purpose 
•  Blinding (masking) 
Trial 1275.10 employed a double-dummy design, i.e. during the double-blind treatment period patients 
received 2 (trial 1275.10) or 5 (trial 1275.1) tablets per day, containing active substances or matching 
placebos).  
•  Statistical methods 
To ensure a balanced distribution of patients with different levels of glycaemic control across the randomised 
treatment groups, randomisation into the double-blind treatment period was stratified by the pre-baseline 
HbA1c value (<8.5% versus ≥8.5%) in all Phase III studies. Randomisation was also stratified by renal 
function (normal renal function: estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] modification of diet in renal 
disease [MDRD] formula ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild impairment: eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2) and 
geographical region (Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia [latter not in study 1275.10]). 
Analysis sets 
The sets used for the analyses of efficacy described in this report are defined below: 
The randomised set (RS) consisted of all patients who were randomised to double-blind study drug, 
regardless of whether any study drug was taken. The treated set (TS) consisted of all patients who were 
randomised and treated with at least one dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial. The 
disposition of patients is described based on this analysis set. 
The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients treated with at least one dose of study drug during the 
double-blind part of the trials who had a baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c 
assessment during the double-blind part of the trial.  The FAS represents the primary population used for 
analyses of the efficacy endpoints. 
The FAS-completers set included all patients in the FAS who completed a minimum of 23 weeks treatment 
in the double-blind part of the trial and who did not prematurely discontinue from the trial prior to the Week 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 16/80 
 
  
  
24 visit. The date of last intake of trial medication had to be on or after the start of the time window for the 
Week 24 visit and an HbA1c value had to be available within the time window for this visit. 
The per protocol set (PPS) consisted of all patients in the FAS who had no important protocol violations 
(IPVs) for efficacy leading to exclusion. The definition of trial-specific IPVs was specified in each trial 
statistical analysis plan. These IPV definitions included consideration of important violations of entry criteria, 
treatment non-compliance, prohibited concomitant medication, and premature unblinding. The final 
decision on which patients were included in the PPS was made prior to unblinding. 
The open-label full analysis set (OLFAS) consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of open-label 
treatment during the trial and who had a pre-treatment HbA1c assessment and at least 1 on-treatment 
HbA1c assessment during the open-label part of the trial (excluding placebo add-on period). The OLFAS was 
the basis for the efficacy analyses of the open-label period in study 1275.10. 
Handling of missing data 
For the main analyses of the primary, key secondary, and most of the further efficacy endpoints in study 
1275.10, an observed cases (OC) approach was used. All available data were analysed as observed, missing 
data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were handled implicitly by the statistical model used 
(mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). Further, all values observed after a patient started rescue 
medication were excluded. 
For study 1275.1, a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used in the main analyses of the 
primary and most of the key secondary and further endpoints. Missing values within a course of 
measurements on treatment were interpolated based on the last observed value before the missing visit and 
the first observed value after the missing visit. Baseline values were carried forward if there was no 
post-baseline value available. Values measured after a patient had taken rescue medication were excluded 
and imputed using the LOCF method. 
Sensitivity analyses with alternative methods of accounting for missing data and rescue medication use were 
performed in order to assess the robustness of the primary and key secondary analysis results (described 
below). 
For the sensitivity analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in study 1275.10, an LOCF 
approach was used to replace missing data by the last observed measurement on treatment. The LOCF 
technique was only implemented for analyses of the double-blind period; data from the open-label period 
were not carried forward into the double-blind period. For study 1275.1, OC was used in sensitivity analyses 
of the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints (FPG and body weight). 
For all studies, a multiple imputation approach, which imputed missing data assuming a relationship with 
baseline HbA1c, baseline renal impairment, region, treatment, as well as any previously observed 
on-treatment HbA1c values, was performed for the primary endpoint; this approach also took into 
consideration the variability of the imputed estimates.  
For the primary and key secondary endpoints in study 1275.10, sensitivity analyses were also performed 
with the OC data but including values that were obtained following rescue medication (OC-IR) in the 
analysis. 
For study 1275.1 only, which according to the protocol, allowed for the collection of efficacy data even after 
patient withdrawal from treatment, additional sensitivity analyses were performed including also those 
measurements that were collected after treatment discontinuation or after rescue medication (OC-AD and 
LOCF-AD). 
An original results (OR) analysis was performed for the use of rescue therapy and for the time to start of 
rescue therapy in all studies. Missing data were not directly imputed for the OR analysis. 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 17/80 
 
  
  
For the categorical responder analysis of HbA1c, missing values were imputed using the noncompleters 
considered failure (NCF) approach, i.e. missing data due to premature discontinuation of a patient or values 
obtained after the introduction of rescue medication were considered as failure to attain response (HbA1c 
<7.0%) up to the last planned visit. 
Definition of baseline and analysis periods 
In all Phase III studies, baseline was defined as the last observation prior to the first intake of any 
double-blind randomised trial medication. Thus, in study 1275.10, the term 'baseline' was not used to refer 
to measurements prior to the administration of open-label medication. Such measurements are referred to 
as 'pre-treatment'. 
Measurements of HbA1c values were regarded as 'on-treatment' if they were taken after the first dose of 
double-blind trial medication and up to 7 days after the last dose of trial medication had been administered. 
For the other efficacy variables, measurements taken after the first dose up to 1 day after the last dose of 
trial medication were regarded as on-treatment values. 
Hypotheses testing 
In study 1275.10, the superiority of linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin and metformin (study 1275.10) 
was tested against placebo using a hierarchical testing procedure which allowed each individual hypothesis 
test to be performed at a two-sided α = 0.05 level of significance, whilst controlling the overall probability of 
a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). 
Study 1275.10 was powered separately for each of the background empagliflozin doses and the statistical 
inference was therefore carried out for studies 1275.10(met+empa25) and 1275.10(met+empa10) 
separately. The order of endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure was the primary endpoint, followed 
by the key secondary endpoint. 
In study 1275.1, the superiority of the FDCs to their individual components was tested separately in the 
metformin-treated and in the treatment-naïve populations. Within each FDC dose level, there were 2 
hypotheses which evaluated whether the FDC was superior to the 2 individual components on the primary 
endpoint and these were tested simultaneously at a two-sided α = 0.05 level of significance. Only if both null 
hypotheses at the higher FDC dose level were rejected, were the hypotheses at the lower FDC dose level 
tested, thereby controlling the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The order of the key 
secondary endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure was the change from baseline in FPG after 24 
weeks, the change from baseline in body weight after 24 weeks, followed by the categorical efficacy 
response analysis for HbA1c (<7%) at Week 24. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint 
The primary analysis in study 1275.10 was performed on the FAS (OC), using a restricted maximum 
likelihood (REML)-based MMRM approach on the change from baseline in HbA1c (in units of %) after 24 
weeks of double-blind treatment. The statistical approach modelled the change from baseline in HbA1c at 
each on-treatment visit, and included fixed classification effects for treatment, region, baseline renal 
function, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, and a linear covariate for baseline HbA1c. An unstructured 
covariance approach was used to model the within-patient errors. The differences between treatment 
groups were presented with a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-value of the hypothesis 
tests referred to in Section 1.3.4. 
The clinical trial protocols of study 1275.10 originally included an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) as the 
primary model. The model was changed to MMRM via global amendments to the protocols. An 
ANCOVA-based model, with factors for treatment, baseline renal function and region and a continuous 
covariate for baseline HbA1c, using an LOCF approach, was used as a sensitivity analysis. 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 18/80 
 
  
  
Further sensitivity analyses, using the same model as defined in the primary analysis, were performed on 
the PPS (to determine the impact of protocol violations on the observed treatment effect), on the 
FAS-completers (to determine the impact of early withdrawals on the observed treatment effect), and on the 
FAS including values obtained after rescue medication (OC-IR). The primary analysis was also repeated on 
the FAS (OC) but additionally including the baseline HbA1c-by-visit interaction. Furthermore, an ANCOVA 
analysis using a multiple imputation approach to account for missing data at Week 24 was done. The primary 
analysis was also repeated using a subset of the FAS, including only patients from sites located in European 
countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, or USA. 
In study 1275.10, a post-hoc assessment of the overall linagliptin versus placebo effect on the primary 
endpoint was done by combining data from both study populations (1275.10(met+empa25) and 
1275.10(met+empa10)). 
In study 1275.1, the primary analysis was an ANCOVA on the FAS (LOCF), including treatment, region, and 
baseline renal function as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c as a linear covariate. 
In addition, an MMRM approach on the FAS (OC) was used. Further sensitivity analyses on different analysis 
sets and including post-treatment as well as post-rescue measurements, termed 'after discontinuation or 
after rescue medication' (AD) were also performed. A sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint using a 
multiple imputation approach on the FAS (OC) was performed. Additionally, the change from baseline in 
HbA1c was analysed based on the FAS (OC and OC-AD) at 52 weeks using an MMRM approach. 
Analysis of the key secondary and further endpoints 
The changes from baseline in FPG, body weight, and blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were analysed in a 
similar way as the change from baseline in HbA1c within the respective study, with the relevant value at 
baseline included as an additional covariate in the analysis model. 
The frequencies of patients who achieved the target levels of HbA1c <7% were analysed. A logistic 
regression model, based on the FAS (NCF), was applied with factors for treatment, region, baseline renal 
function, and a linear covariate for HbA1c at baseline. 
A logistic regression, with treatment as a factor and continuous baseline HbA1c as a covariate, was also 
performed using the FAS (OR) on the proportion of patients who used rescue therapy. In addition, the 
Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test were used to analyse the time to first use of rescue medication for 
the FAS (OR). 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary and the key secondary endpoints in study 1275.10. In 
study 1275.1, subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint while for the key secondary 
endpoints, only selected subgroups were assessed. The presentation of subgroups in this SCE focuses on 
selected primary endpoint analyses. Further subgroup analyses can be found in the clinical trial reports of 
the individual studies. 
In study 1275.10, subgroups were analysed using a similar MMRM model as for the primary endpoint, with 
additional terms for subgroup, subgroup-by-visit, subgroup-bytreatment, and 
visit-by-treatment-by-subgroup interactions. Note that any subgroup category that had any cell with fewer 
than 5 observations per treatment and visit combination was excluded from the MMRM analyses. 
In study 1275.1, subgroups were analysed using a similar ANCOVA model as for the primary endpoint, with 
additional terms for subgroup and treatment-by-subgroup interaction. Subgroups with fewer than 35 
patients in total were excluded from the ANCOVA analyses. 
In all studies, a p-value for the treatment-by-subgroup interaction term at Week 24 of <0.1 was considered 
to indicate a potential interaction effect.

The influence of demographic factors was evaluated in subgroups based on age, gender, weight, race, 
ethnicity, and geographical region. The influence of the duration and severity of diabetes was investigated in 
subgroups for time since diagnosis of diabetes and baseline HbA1c. The possible effect of renal impairment 
was evaluated in subgroups by renal function (eGFR, using the MDRD formula). An overview of all subgroup 
analyses that are presented in this SCE is provided in

Results  
•  Participant flow  
Trial 1275.10 
This trial was an international, multi-centre trial. A total of 1324 patients were screened by 114 centres in 10 
countries across Europe, North America, Latin America, and Australia. Of the screened patients, 706 patients 
were treated with open-label treatment; 354 patients were treated with empa 25 OL and 352 patients with 
empa 10 OL. A total of 482 patients (68.3% of the patients treated with open-label treatment) entered the 
double blind treatment period. Reasons for not entering double-blind treatment were mostly that patients 
did not meet the inclusion criterion HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.5% (20.6% of patients in the OLS); most of these 
patients had achieved glycaemic control (HbA1c <7.0%) at Visit 4. It was planned to randomise 448 
patients, but 482 patients were actually randomised to double-blind trial treatment in a 1:1 ratio for the trial

population A (lina 5 or placebo added-on to metformin+empa 25; 226 patients overall) and in a 1:1 ratio for 
the trial population B (lina 5 or placebo added-on to metformin+empa 10; 256 patients overall). 
At Visit 4, 114 patients were randomised to treatment with lina 5 and 112 patients to placebo treatment 
(Table 6). Of the patients randomised to and treated with double-blind treatment, 207 patients (92.4%) 
completed the 24-week treatment period; 102 (91.1%) in the lina 5 group and 105 (93.8%) in the placebo 
group. The percentage of patients prematurely discontinuing trial medication was higher in the lina 5 group 
(8.9%) compared with the placebo group (6.3%), which was mostly due to more patients being lost to 
follow-up in the lina 5 group compared with the placebo group (4.5% vs. 1.8%). Discontinuations due to AEs 
occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the lina 5 group and 1.8 % of the patients in the placebo group; none 
were due to a worsening of T2DM. Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was reported for 1 patient in the 
placebo group. The proportions of patients who prematurely discontinued trial medication were higher in 
North America (lina 5: 11.1%, placebo: 14.8%) than in Europe (lina 5: 9.8%, placebo: 3.8%), or Latin 
America (lina 5: 5.9%, placebo: 3.0%). Three patients discontinued due to other reasons.

Trial 1275.1 
Disposition of patients in study 1275.1(met) 
In study 1275.1(met), a total of 686 metformin-treated patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
FDC empa 25/lina 5, empa 25, FDC empa 10/lina 5, empa 10, or lina 5. All randomised patients were 
treated. Overall, 8.5% of the treated patients prematurely discontinued study medication up to Week 24 and 
12.4% prematurely discontinued study medication up to Week 52 (Table 7). The frequency of patients who 
prematurely discontinued study medication was low and comparable in all treatment groups at Week 24 and 
52.

•  Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics in study 1275.10 (met+empa10) 
Demographic data at baseline in study 1275.10 (met+empa10) were generally similar across the 2 
treatment groups. Overall, 56.3% of patients were male. The majority of patients were White (96.8%). The 
mean (SD) age in the treatment groups was 56.7 (9.5) years and the mean BMI was 31.01 (5.07) kg/m2. 
The majority of patients (57.5%) had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for >5 years. Based on eGFR 
(MDRD formula) values, most of the patients (97.2%) had either normal renal function or mild renal 
impairment (48.6% each) at baseline.

Demographic characteristics in study 1275.1 (met) 
The key demographic characteristics in study 1275.1 (met) were similar across the treatment groups. 
Overall, more than half (53.7%) of the patients were male. The majority of patients in this population were 
White (73.9%). The mean (SD) age of all patients was 56.2 (10.2) years and the mean (SD) BMI was 31.0 
(5.5) kg/m2. More than half (55.2%) of the patients had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for >5 years. 
Based on eGFR (MDRD formula) values, most of the patients (97.3%) had either normal renal function 
(43.9%) or mild renal impairment (53.4%) at baseline. The demographic characteristics at baseline in study 
1275.1(met) are shown in Table 9.

Design 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison study. Patients 
were recruited and randomised at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with linagliptin 5 mg 
(lina 5) or placebo, each as add-on therapy to empagliflozin 25 mg (empa 25) 
and metformin (study population 1275.10(met+empa25)) or empagliflozin 10 mg 
(empa 10) and metformin (study population 1275.10(met+empa10)). 
Randomisation was stratified by baseline HbA1c, renal function, and 
geographical region. The main objective of the trial was to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of lina 5 compared with placebo, as add-on to empa (25 or 
10) and metformin, administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient glycaemic control after the preceding 
16 weeks of open-label treatment with empagliflozin and metformin.

Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients randomised and treated with at 
least one dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who had 
a baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c assessment 
during the double-blind period. An observed cases (OC) approach was used. 
All available data were analysed as observed, missing data were not directly 
imputed prior to analysis and were handled implicitly by the statistical model 
used (mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). Further, all values observed 
after a patient started rescue medication were excluded. 
Confirmatory tests for the superiority of lina 5 add-on to empa 25 and 
metformin vs. placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoints followed a 
hierarchical testing procedure that allowed each test to be done at a two-sided 
alpha = 0.05 level of significance, whilst controlling the overall probability of a 
type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The procedure started with the primary 
endpoint and continued with the key secondary endpoint.

The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients treated with at least one dose 
of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who had a baseline HbA1c 
assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c assessment during the 
double-blind period.  
An observed cases (OC) approach was used. All available data were analysed 
as observed, missing data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were 
handled implicitly by the statistical model used (mixed model repeated 
measures [MMRM]). Further, all values observed after a patient started rescue 
medication were excluded. 
Confirmatory tests for the superiority of lina 5 add-on to empa 10 and 
metformin vs. placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoints followed a 
hierarchical testing procedure that allowed each test to be done at a two-sided 
alpha = 0.05 level of significance, whilst controlling the overall probability of a 
type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The procedure started with the primary 
endpoint and continued with the key secondary endpoint.

Treatment with linagliptin 5 mg resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in 
HbA1c and FPG when administered as add-on treatment to empagliflozin 25 
mg or empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin after 24 weeks of treatment in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus having met the HbA1c inclusion criterion 
(HbA1c: ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) after 16 weeks of open-label treatment with 
either empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin or empagliflozin 10 mg and 
metformin. The placebo-adjusted treatment differences in HbA1c and FPG after 
24 weeks of treatment with linagliptin 5 mg administered as add-on therapy to 
empagliflozin and metformin were statistically significant. The robustness of 
the primary analysis was confirmed over a number of sensitivity analyses 
investigating the influence of use of rescue medication, protocol violations, 
and premature discontinuations. Subgroup analyses supported the 
consistency of the primary and key secondary efficacy results across a wide 
range of subpopulations. 
The proportion of patients reaching target levels of HbA1c<7% after 24 weeks 
of treatment, which was a further endpoint in this study, was higher after 
treatment with linagliptin 5 mg than with placebo. Reductions vs. placebo in 
body weight and blood pressure (further endpoints) were not noticed with 
linagliptin 5 mg treatment in the double-blind treatment period, but occured 
during the initial open-label treatment period with empagliflozin, consistent 
with the mode of action of the two compounds. 
Title: A phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of once daily oral administration of BI 10773 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and BI 10773 10 mg/linagliptin 
5 mg Fixed Dose Combination tablets compared with the individual components (BI 10773 25 mg, BI 
10773 10 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg) for 52 weeks in treatment naïve and metformin treated patients

Design 
This was a 52-week randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison study. Patients 
were recruited and randomised at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to FDC empa 25/lina 5, FDC empa 
10/ lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, or lina 5. Randomisation was stratified by screening 
HbA1c, renal function at screening, and geographical region. The main objective of the 
trial was to investigate the efficacy (superiority testing), safety, and tolerability of the 
2 FDCs vs. their individual components given as tablets once daily for 52 weeks in 
metformin-treated (study population 1275.1(met)) or drug-naïve patients (study 
population 1275.1(naïve)) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient glycaemic control. 
The primary efficacy analysis was done after 24 weeks of treatment.

Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients treated with at least one dose 
of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who had a baseline 
HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c assessment during 
the double-blind period.  
An ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) with a last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) approach was used for the main analyses, excluding values after 
rescue medication. Confirmatory testing of the superiority of the FDCs vs. 
their individual components was done separately in each patient population. 
Within each FDC dose level in study population 1275.1(met), 2 hypotheses 
evaluating whether the FDC was superior to the 2 individual components on 
the primary endpoint were tested simultaneously at a two-sided alfa = 0.05 
level of significance. Only if both null hypotheses at the higher FDC dose 
level were rejected, were the hypotheses at the lower FDC dose level to be 
tested, thereby controlling the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 
(two-sided). The 3 key secondary endpoints were to be subsequently tested 
in a pre-defined order (see results below). For the third key secondary 
endpoint, logistic regression was used, on the FAS (NCF, non-completers 
considered failure). Upon a health authority request, an observed cases (OC) 
approach was also used. All available data were analysed as observed, 
missing data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were handled 
implicitly by the statistical model used (mixed model repeated measures 
[MMRM]). Further, all values observed after a patient started rescue 
medication were excluded.

Notes 
Treatment with the FDCs empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and 
empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg in patients with metformin background 
medication led to clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c with statistically 
significant differences vs. empagliflozin 25 mg or 10 mg and linagliptin 5 mg 
after 24 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
differences were observed with both FDCs for the change from baseline in 
FPG, body weight (comparison vs. linagliptin 5 mg only), and for the 
treat-to-target efficacy response (patients with HbA1c<7.0% among those 
with HbA1c≥7.0%) after 24 weeks of treatment. A number of sensitivity and 
subgroup analyses provided consistent results with the primary analyses.  
Further exploratory endpoints also indicated clinically relevant 
improvements with the FDCs vs. the individual components. A higher 
proportion of patients treated with the FDcs than with the individual 
components reached target HbA1c levels of <6.5% or had an HbA1c reduction 
of at least 0.5% after 24 weeks of treatment.  
Clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure were noted for both FDCs; 
relevant differences to the linagliptin 5 mg group were shown. Reductions in 
waist circumference in the FDC and empagliflozin treatment groups were 
consistent with the observed reduction in body weight after 24 weeks of 
treatment. The proportions of patients who required rescue medication 
on-treatment was low in all groups. 
The clinically revelant improvements in parameters of glycaemic control with 
FDC treatment were maintained over the entire 52-week treatment period.

Change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
After 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, there was a reduction in HbA1c in the lina 5 group. Based on the 
MMRM analysis on the FAS (OC), a statistically significant and a clinically relevant difference (p<0.0001) 
between lina 5 and placebo was seen. The treatment difference versus placebo for the adjusted mean 
change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c was -0.47% (95% CI: -0.66, -0.28). The changes from baseline

Change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks in study 1275.10(pooled) 
In a post-hoc analysis pooling the 2 study populations (metformin plus empa 25 and empa 10 backgrounds), 
the adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c was -0.55% in the lina 5 group and -0.16% 
in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of -0.40% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.27; p<0.0001) in 
favour of lina 5.

The mean (SD) pre-treatment HbA1c for patients in the open-label period of the study (OLFAS) was 8.96 
(0.80)%. The mean change from pre-treatment after 16 weeks of the open-label treatment with empa 25 
was -1.42 (0.94)%. Overall, 84 out of 334 patients in the OLFAS (25.1%) reached the glycaemic goal of an 
HbA1c value <7% after 16 weeks of open-label treatment. Only patients with an HbA1c value between 7.0% 
and 10.5% (baseline value) after the 16-week open-label period were eligible for double-blind treatment. 
Out of 99 patients with an HbA1c measurement at Week 16 who did not enter double-blind treatment, 82 
patients (82.8%) had HbA1c <7% and 17 patients (17.2%) had HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%.

Change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks in the Phase III study 1275.1(met) 
After 24 weeks of treatment in study 1275.1(met), there were reductions in HbA1c in all treatment groups. 
The primary analysis using an ANCOVA model on the FAS (LOCF) showed statistically significant differences 
(p<0.0001) between both FDC empagliflozin/linagliptin doses and their individual components. For the FDC 
empa 25/lina 5 group, the difference for the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was 
-0.58% (95% CI: -0.75, -0.41) versus empa 25 and -0.50% (95% CI: -0.67, -0.32) versus lina 5. For the 
FDC empa 10/lina 5 group, the difference was  0.42% (95% CI: -0.59, -0.25) versus empa 10 and -0.39% 
(95% CI: -0.56, -0.21) versus lina 5. The changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 in study 1275.1(met) 
are summarised in Table 15, upper panel.

Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose in the Phase III study 1275.1(met) 
After 24 weeks of treatment in study 1275.1(met), there were clinically relevant reductions in FPG with both 
doses of the FDC empagliflozin/linagliptin and also for the empagliflozin groups. In the lina 5 group, the 
reduction from baseline was smaller. The ANCOVA analysis on the FAS (LOCF) of FPG showed statistically 
significant and clinically relevant differences between the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group and its individual 
components (both p<0.0001). The difference for the adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 24 in FPG 
for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group was -0.91 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.30, -0.53) versus empa 25 and -1.23 
mmol/L (95% CI: -1.63, -0.84) versus lina 5. The analysis also showed clinical and statistical superiority of 
the FDC empa 10/lina 5 to its individual components empa 10 (p-value = 0.0015) and lina 5 (p<0.0001). 
The treatment difference for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 group was -0.63 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.02, -0.24) versus 
empa 10 and -1.06 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.45, -0.67) versus lina 5. The changes from baseline in FPG in study

between them. The difference versus lina 5 was -2.5 mmHg (95% CI: -4.1, -0.9) for the FDC empa 25/lina 
5 group and -1.4 mmHg (95% CI: -3.0, 0.2) for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 group.  
Use of rescue medication 
Use of rescue medication in the Phase III study 1275.10 
Use of rescue medication in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
Use of antidiabetic rescue medication during 24 weeks of double-blind treatment was reported only for 3 
patients (2.7%) in the placebo group; none of the patients in the lina 5 group received rescue medication. 
Due to the low number of patients with rescue medication no odds ratio was calculated.  
Use of rescue medication in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
Use of antidiabetic rescue medication during 24 weeks of double-blind treatment was reported for 2 patients 
in the lina 5 group (1.6%) and 5 patients in the placebo group (4.0%). Due to the low numbers of patients 
requiring rescue therapy, the associated odds ratio did not reveal relevant differences between the 
treatment groups.

Use of rescue medication in the Phase III study 1275.1(met)  
Very few patients in study 1275.1(met) required the use of rescue medication during 24 weeks of treatment: 
1 patient (0.7%) in the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group, 3 patients (2.2%) in the FDC empa 10/lina 5 group, 6 
patients (4.3%) in the empa 25 group, 1 patient (0.7%) in the empa 10 group, and 4 patients (3.1%) in the 
lina 5 group. Due to the low numbers of patients requiring rescue therapy, the associated odds ratios did not 
reveal relevant differences between the treatment groups.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Comparison of results in subpopulations 
Selected subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in studies 1275.10, and 1275.1 are presented in 
sections below. For study 1275.1 only subgroups analysed in the metformin-treated population are 
presented. As the subgroup analyses were conducted on trial level, the number of patients in some of the 
subgroups was low and thus the results of these analyses should be interpreted with caution.  
Age 
Subgroup analysis by age in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The changes from baseline in HbA1c were higher in older patients (p-value for the treatment-by-age 
interaction: 0.0699). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were 
-0.38% (95% CI: -0.58, -0.17) for patients aged <65 years and -0.84% (95% CI: -1.30, -0.38) for patients 
aged 65 to <75 years. As only 4 patients 75 years or older were included in the FAS, this subgroup was not 
analysed.  
Subgroup analysis by age in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The changes from baseline in HbA1c were similar across the analysed age groups; no indication of a 
treatment-by-age interaction was seen (p-value: 0.8851). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from 
baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.32% (95% CI: -0.54, -0.11) for patients aged <65 years and 
-0.36% (95% CI: -0.83, 0.11) for patients aged 65 to <75 years. As only 4 patients 75 years or older were 
included in each treatment group, this subgroup was not analysed.  
Subgroup analysis by age in study 1275.1(met) 
The subgroup analysis by age (using categories of patients <50 years, 50 to <65 years, and 65 to <75 
years) showed that all age groups had changes in HbA1c after 24 weeks in all treatment groups. In general, 
the magnitude of treatment difference between FDCs and their individual components decreased with 
increasing age. The p-value for the treatment-by-age interaction was 0.0058, suggesting that the treatment 
effect differed across the analysed subgroups. The category ≥75 years was not included in the analysis as it 
contained fewer than 35 patients.  
Gender 
Subgroup analysis by gender in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The treatment effects were of similar magnitude in both genders. There was no evidence of a 
treatment-by-gender interaction (p-value = 0.8436). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.45% (95% CI: -0.72, -0.19) in male patients and -0.49% (95% CI: 
-0.77, -0.22) in female patients

The mean changes from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks were similar in the lina 5 group in male patients 
(-0.50%) and female patients (-0.57%). Due to a stronger placebo effect in the male subgroup, the 
placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c was lower in male patients: -0.19% 
(95% CI: -0.45, 0.07), compared with female patients: -0.49% (95% CI: -0.78, -0.20). The p-value for the 
treatment-by-gender interaction was 0.1293.  
Subgroup analysis by gender in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean changes in HbA1c after 24 weeks and the associated treatment differences between the 
FDCs and their single components were generally similar in both genders. There was no indication of a 
treatment-by-gender interaction (p-value = 0.6657).  
Race 
Subgroup analysis by race in study 1275.10 
As the majority of patients (96.8%) in study 1275.10 were of White race, and the remaining race categories 
contained fewer than 5 patients per group, this subgroup analysis was not conducted.  
Subgroup analysis by race in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean changes in HbA1c after 24 weeks and the associated treatment differences between the 
FDCs and their single components were generally similar in White, Black/African American, and Asian 
patients. As the majority of patients in the study were White (73.9%), the subgroups of Black/African 
American and Asian patients were relatively small. There was no indication of a treatment-by-race 
interaction (p = 0.6351).  
Ethnicity 
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The treatment effects were generally of similar magnitude in patients of Hispanic/Latino and not 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. There was no evidence of a treatment-by-ethnicity interaction (p-value = 
0.5053). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.56% 
(95% CI: -0.87, -0.24) in Hispanic patients and -0.42% (95% CI: -0.66, -0.19) in non-Hispanic patients.  
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The treatment effects were generally of similar magnitude in patients of Hispanic/Latino and not 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. There was no evidence of a treatment-by-ethnicity interaction (p-value = 
0.6879). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.37% 
(95% CI: -0.69, -0.05) in Hispanic patients and -0.29% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.04) in non-Hispanic patients.  
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean changes in HbA1c after 24 weeks and the associated treatment differences between the 
FDCs and their single components were generally similar in patients of Hispanic/Latino and not 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. There was no evidence of a treatment-by-ethnicity interaction (p-value = 
0.3394).  
Geographical region 
Subgroup analysis by geographical region in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The treatment effects were of similar magnitude across geographical regions. There was no evidence of a 
treatment-by-region interaction (p-value = 0.7317). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.43% (95% CI: -0.71, -0.16) in Europe, -0.62% (95% CI: -1.02, -0.21) 
in North America, and -0.43% (95% CI: -0.77, -0.10) in Latin America. A sensitivity analysis of the primary

the primary analysis, with treatment effect estimates similar to those of the primary analysis.  
Subgroup analysis by geographical region in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The treatment effects were of similar magnitude across geographical regions. There was no evidence of a 
treatment-by-region interaction (p-value = 0.8124). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.28% (95% CI: -0.56, -0.01) in Europe, -0.29% (95% CI: -0.74, 0.16) 
in North America, and -0.42% (95% CI: -0.77, -0.07) in Latin America. A sensitivity analysis of the primary 
endpoint including patients from Europe, Australia, Canada, and USA gave results that were consistent with 
the primary analysis, with treatment effect estimates similar to those of the primary analysis.  
Subgroup analysis by geographical region in study 1275.1(met) 
The treatment effects were generally of similar magnitude across Europe, North America, Latin America, and 
Asia. Differences between the regions included higher adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c after 
24 weeks in the FDC groups in Asia and lower changes from baseline in HbA1c in the monotherapy groups in 
North America. However, there was no indication of a treatment-by-region interaction, as evidenced by the 
interaction p-value of 0.4759.  
Baseline body weight 
Subgroup analysis by baseline body weight in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline body weight showed larger treatment effects in patients with baseline 
body weight ≤80 kg compared with patients with higher body weight; however, no indication for a 
treatment-by-baseline body weight interaction was seen (p-value = 0.3481). The placebo-adjusted mean 
changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.66% (95% CI: -1.21, -0.12) for patients with 
a baseline weight ≤70 kg, -0.67% (95% CI: -1.05, -0.28) for patients with a baseline weight >70 to ≤80 kg, 
-0.21% (95% CI: -0.59, 0.18) for patients with a baseline weight >80 to ≤90 kg, and -0.44% (95% CI: 
-0.76, -0.13) for patients with a baseline weight >90 kg.  
Subgroup analysis by baseline body weight in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline body weight showed larger treatment effects in patients with baseline 
body weight ≤70 kg compared with the other subgroups; however, no indication for a treatment-by-baseline 
body weight interaction was seen (p-value = 0.3029). The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.77% (95% CI:-1.27, -0.26) for patients with a baseline weight ≤70 kg, 
-0.18% (95% CI:-0.61, 0.24) for patients with a baseline weight >70 to ≤80 kg, -0.24% (95% CI:-0.63, 
0.15) for patients with a baseline weight >80 to ≤90 kg, and -0.30% (95% CI:-0.61, 0.02) for patients with 
a baseline weight >90 kg.  
Subgroup analysis by baseline body weight in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean changes in HbA1c after 24 weeks and the associated treatment differences between the 
FDCs and their single components were generally similar in groups of patients with different baseline weight. 
There was no indication of a treatment-by-weight interaction (p-value = 0.6014).  
Baseline HbA1c 
Subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c showed similar treatment effects in both subgroups; no indication 
for a treatment-by-baseline HbA1c interaction was seen (p-value = 0.4115). The placebo-adjusted mean 
changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.43% (95% CI: -0.63, -0.22) for patients with 
a baseline HbA1c <8.5% and -0.62% (95% CI: -1.05, -0.19) for patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥8.5%.

Subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c showed similar treatment effects in both subgroups; no indication 
for a treatment-by-baseline HbA1c interaction was seen (p-value = 0.9869). The placebo-adjusted mean 
changes from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.34% (95% CI: -0.57, -0.11) for patients with 
a baseline HbA1c <8.5% and -0.33%(95% CI: -0.72, 0.05) for patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥8.5%.  
Subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c in study 1275.1(met) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c showed higher mean adjusted changes from baseline in HbA1c 
after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥8.5% compared with patients with a baseline 
HbA1c <8.5% in all treatment groups. The treatment-by-baseline HbA1c interaction p-value was 0.1142.  
Time since diagnosis of diabetes 
Subgroup analysis by time since diagnosis of diabetes in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The treatment effects were generally of similar magnitude across the analysed subgroups. There was no 
indication of a treatment-by-time since diagnosis interaction (p-value = 0.8046). Note that the group of 
patients diagnosed a year or less before the study was small (total of 17 patients) and thus the results of its 
analysis should be interpreted with particular caution. The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.23% (95% CI: -0.88, 0.43) in patients diagnosed ≤1 year, -0.51% 
(95% CI: -0.86, -0.15) in patients diagnosed >1 to 5 years, -0.56% (95% CI: -0.88, -0.24) in patients 
diagnosed >5 to 10 years, and -0.41% (95% CI: -0.76, -0.05) in patients diagnosed >10 years before the 
study.  
Subgroup analysis by time since diagnosis of diabetes in study 1275.10(met+empa10) 
The treatment effects were generally of similar magnitude across the analysed subgroups. There was no 
indication of a treatment-by-time since diagnosis interaction (p-value = 0.8717). Note that the group of 
patients diagnosed a year or less before the study was small (total of 23 patients) and thus the results of its 
analysis should be interpreted with particular caution. The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.38% (95% CI: -1.05, 0.30) in patients diagnosed ≤1 year, -0.43% 
(95% CI: -0.77, -0.09) in patients diagnosed >1 to 5 years, -0.31% (95% CI: -0.66, 0.04) in patients 
diagnosed >5 to 10 years, and -0.21% (95% CI: -0.60, 0.17) in patients diagnosed >10 years before the 
study.  
Subgroup analysis by time since diagnosis of diabetes in study 1275.1(met) 
In both FDC and both empagliflozin dose groups, the largest mean adjusted changes from baseline in HbA1c 
after 24 weeks were observed for the group of recently diagnosed patients and in general treatment effects 
decreased with increasing time since diagnosis. The differences between the subgroups of patients 
diagnosed at different times were not apparent in the lina 5 group. The treatment-by-time since diagnosis 
interaction p-value was 0.2417.  
Renal function 
Subgroup analysis by renal function in study 1275.10(met+empa25) 
The treatment effect was higher in patients with normal renal function (eGFR [MDRD]: ≥90 mL/min/1.73 
m2) than in patients with mild renal impairment (60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2); the treatment-by-baseline 
renal function interaction p-value was 0.1416. The placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline to Week 
24 in HbA1c for lina 5 were -0.62% (95% CI: -0.89, -0.35) for patients with normal renal function and 
-0.34% (95% CI: -0.60, -0.08) for patients with mild renal impairment. As there were fewer than 5 patients 
per group with baseline eGFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and only 1 patient with baseline eGFR <45 
mL/min/1.73 m2, these categories were not analysed.

Subgroup analysis by renal function in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were in general similar between patients with normal 
renal function and patients with mild renal impairment. There was no indication of a treatment-by-baseline 
renal function interaction (p-value = 0.4942). 
PERSISTENCE OF EFFICACY AND/OR TOLERANCE EFFECTS 
CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN HBA1C AFTER 52 WEEKS IN THE PHASE III STUDY 1275.1 
The change from baseline in HbA1c and the efficacy response measured as HbA1c <7.0% after 52 weeks of 
treatment were further endpoints in study 1275.1. 
The adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c over time in study 1275.1(met) 
The adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c over time in study 1275.1(met), based on the ANCOVA 
analysis on the FAS (LOCF), is shown below. The maximal treatment effect in all treatment groups was seen 
at Week 12 and was maintained thereafter through Week 52 (Figure 4). 
Figure 4 Change from baseline in HbA1c [%] over 52 weeks in study 1275.1(met) - ANCOVA FAS 
(LOCF) 
The ANCOVA analysis of the change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment showed consistent 
results with the primary analysis after 24 weeks, see Table 20. For the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group, the 
treatment difference at Week 52 was -0.57% (95% CI: -0.77, -0.37) versus empa 25 and -0.73% (95% CI:

Similarly as seen in the 24-week analysis, the percentage of patients who attained HbA1c <7.0% after 52 
weeks was higher in the FDC treatment groups than in the monotherapy groups ( 
Table 21): 48.0% of the patients in the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group and 51.6% of the patients in the FDC 
empa 10/lina 5 group attained HbA1c values of less than 7.0% after 52 weeks of treatment, compared with

with both doses of the FDC empagliflozin/linagliptin and also for both empagliflozin monotherapy groups. In 
the lina 5 group, the change from baseline in FPG was small (Table 22). The treatment difference for the FDC 
empa 25/lina 5 group was -1.13 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.60, -0.67) versus empa 25 and -1.59 mmol/L (95.0%

CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN BODY WEIGHT AFTER 52 WEEKS IN THE PHASE III STUDY 1275.1 
The change from baseline in body weight after 52 weeks of treatment in study 1275.1(met). 
The reductions observed at Week 24 in body weight with both doses of the FDC empagliflozin/linagliptin and 
for both empagliflozin doses were maintained at Week 52. There was no relevant change in body weight in 
the lina 5 group. Based on the ANCOVA analysis on the FAS (LOCF), the adjusted mean (SE) change from 
baseline in body weight was -3.13 (0.32) kg for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group and -2.69 (0.32) kg for the 
FDC empa 10/lina 5 group, compared with -2.80 (0.32) kg for the empa 25 group, -2.93 (0.32) kg for the 
empa 10 group, and -0.26 (0.33) kg for the lina 5 group. The difference versus lina 5 was -2.87 kg (95% CI: 
-3.78, -1.97) for the FDC empa 25 /lina 5 group and -2.43 kg (95% CI: -3.34, -1.52) for the FDC empa

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A complete development program including several Phase III studies was conducted for linagliptin and 
supported the approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The indication linagliptin as add on to 
empagliflozin is supported by 2 pivotal studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 1 add-on study 
(1275.10) and one factorial design study (1275.1).  
These studies were also part of the marketing authorisation of Glyxambi, the FDC of empagliflozin and 
linagliptin (EMEA/H/C/003833). Glyxambi was authorised in the EU for use in patients with type 2 diabetes 
in November 2016.The  Phase III add-on study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin 
as add-on therapy to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin (study 1275.10) in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and metformin background medication. In this study, the FDC of empa/lina was used. In the 
factorial design study, patients were randomised into 5 treatment groups:  empa 25/lina 5, empa 10/lina 5, 
empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5 (1275.1). The superiority of each FDC was tested against its respective 
individual components. Bioequivalence of the FDC with the individual components was established. No 
drug-drug-interactions between the monocomponents were observed.  
Linagliptin is now indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in 
adults as monotherapy in patients for whom metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindicated 
due to renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is indicated as combination therapy in combination with 
metformin, sulphonylurea and metformin, and insulin with or without metformin. According to the Applicant, 
the linagliptin is also indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults 
in combination with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these 
medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
In general, design of the new studies is acceptable. The add-on study is pivotal for the indication of 
linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin. The factorial design study provides supportive data on the 
combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin.  
Study population and in/exclusion criteria are reasonable. Treatments and objectives are acceptable. 
Although HbA1c is a surrogate endpoint, it is acceptable.  
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 50/80 
 
  
  
 
 
The study populations can be considered relatively representative of the target population. However, due to 
the fact that empagliflozin and metformin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few 
patients with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥75 years old were 
included. This limits the external validity of the trial to the total population. However, the separate clinical 
development programs for the monocomponents linagliptin and empagliflozin included more patients within 
this age category. Although the issue remains that there is limited knowledge on the efficacy and safety of 
the combination linagliptin and empagliflozin in these patients, this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
The sample size estimations, randomisation procedures and blinding procedures are considered adequate. 
An intention to treat (ITT) analysis for the primary outcome is preferred over a modified intention to treat 
(mITT) analysis. The mITT analyses can be accepted if the difference in patients between ITT and mITT 
population is so small that no impact on the overall results are likely. As this is the fact, in this case, the 
definition of analysis populations and the stratification factors are adequate. 
In study 1275.1, the primary analysis was an ANCOVA on the FAS, including treatment, region, and baseline 
renal function as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c as a linear covariate. Missing data was handled using 
LOCF. In study 1275.10, an observed cases approach was used. The primary analysis was a longitudinal 
repeated measures analysis (MMRM), which handled the missing data. Originally ANCOVA was planned, but 
this was changed to the repeated measures analysis via an amendment to the protocol, before database 
lock. 
MMRM assumes data to be missing at random, and that subjects that discontinue or need rescue medication 
would have behaved similarly to other subjects in the same treatment group, had they not dropped out. It 
aims to assess the treatment effect as if the treatment is taken as directed, and obscures the effect of 
discontinuation or rescue medication. Therefore, the longitudinal repeated measures analysis tends not to 
be robust in the situation where there is a decreasing treatment effect difference after discontinuation or 
rescue medication. However, the analysis was accompanied by several sensitivity analyses, using various 
assumptions. These analyses resulted in similar treatment differences. The primary analyses are considered 
acceptable. 
Continuous secondary endpoints were analysed similarly to the primary endpoint. Categorical secondary 
endpoints were analysed using logistical regression. Time to rescue medication was analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. The methods are standard for these kinds of variables and are acceptable. 
In study 1275.10, multiplicity was handled by using a hierarchical testing procedure, with each test 
performed at alpha = 0.05. In study 1275.1, the FDC empa/lina was tested against both components 
simultaneously and both had to be statistically significant to proceed testing. These measures ensures 
control of the overall type I error rate and are acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total, 1164 patients were treated in the double-blind periods of the studies included in the evaluation in 
this report. These included 478 patients from trial 1275.10; of these 238 patients were treated with 
linagliptin and 240 patients were treated with placebo. A further 686 patients from trial 1275.1(met) are also 
included. The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups. 
Primary endpoint: HbA1c 
Linagliptin as add-on therapy to empagliflozin (study 1275.10):  
The treatment effects of linagliptin in patients that are treated with empagliflozin were of borderline clinical 
relevance. The treatment effect of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.47% (95% CI: -0.66, 
-0.28) and the effect of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin 10 mg was -0.32% (95% CI: -0.52, -0.13). The 
pooled treatment difference of linagliptin was -0.40% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.27; p<0.0001).

Factorial design study with FDC and individual components (study 1275.1):  
The difference between the FDC and monotherapy with empagliflozin were also of borderline clinical 
relevance. In metformin treated patients, the treatment difference for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group was 
-0.58% (95% CI: -0.75, -0.41) versus empa 25 and the treatment difference for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 
group was  -0.42% (95% CI: -0.59, -0.25) versus empa 10.  
Other endpoints: fasting glucose 
In general, the results for changes in FPG were consistent with the results for the changes in HbA1c. The 
effects of linagliptin on top off empagliflozin on fasting plasma glucose in study 1275.10 were small. The 
adjusted mean difference of lina 5 versus placebo for the mean change in FPG was -0.65 mmol/L (95% CI: 
-1.15, -0.16; p = 0.0103) in combination with empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.44 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.87, 
-0.01; p = 0.045) in combination with empagliflozin 25 mg. 
The difference in fasting glucose between the FDC empa/lina and empagliflozin were very small. In 
metformin treated patients, for the FDC empa 25/lina 5, the FPG adjusted mean difference was -0.91 (SE 
0.20) mmol/L vs. empa 25 and -1.23 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. lina 5. For the FDC empa 10/lina 5, the FPG 
adjusted mean difference was -0.63 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. empa 10 and -1.06 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. lina 5. 
In naïve patients, for the FDC empagliflozin 10/lina 5 group, the FPG adjusted mean difference was -23.63 
mg/dL (95.0% CI: -31.06,-16.21) vs empa 25 mg and for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 was -22.29 mg/dL (95.0% 
CI: -29.71,-14.88) vs empa 10 mg.  
Other endpoints: body weight 
As could be expected based on linagliptin's mechanism of action, linagliptin in combination with 
empagliflozin in study 1275.10 was not associated with statistically significant changes in body weight in 
comparison to placebo. In study 1275.01 (met), linagliptin was also not associated with weight loss.  
Other endpoints: blood pressure 
In study 1275.10, linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin (25 mg and 10 mg) and metformin provided no 
reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. 
In study 1275.1, there were also no changes in blood pressure with linagliptin treatment.  
Efficacy after 52 weeks 
In general, in study 1275.1, the effects after 52 weeks were in line with the findings after 24 weeks.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The contribution of linagliptin as add on to empagliflozin and metformin is small but clinically relevant.  
Due to the fact that empagliflozin and metformin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, 
only a few patients with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥75 years old 
were included.  This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The individual clinical development programme conducted with linagliptin established the safety profile. The 
main safety aspects are briefly summarised below. 
Overall, in clinical studies the frequencies of adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and 
serious adverse events were very similar across studies, and similar between linagliptin and placebo groups. 
Listed side effects of linagliptin are grouped by background treatment regimen. For monotherapy with 
linagliptin (and all backgrounds) nasopharyngitis, cough, hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, angioedema, 
urticaria, rash, mouth ulceration, and increased amylase have been identified as listed events. 
Hypoglycaemia was identified as listed event only when added to a background treatment of metformin plus 
sulphonylurea. Constipation was identified as listed event only on a background of insulin 
The MAH has conducted a large number of clinical studies for linagliptin. This AR will focus only on the add 
on study of linagliptin to empagliflozin (study 1275.10), and factorial design study with linagliptin and 
empagliflozin (study 1275.1), and the Phase I studies 1275.3 and 1245.30, see Table 23. All studies have 
been performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the 
respective national regulatory requirements. 
In total, 1164 patients were treated in the double-blind periods of the studies included in the evaluation 
presented in this document. These included 478 patients from trial 1275.10; of these 238 patients were 
treated with linagliptin and 240 patients were treated with placebo. A further 686 patients from trial 
1275.1(met) are also included.  
The treated set (TS) was used for the analysis of safety and comprised all patients who received at least one 
dose of study medication. Adverse events were coded with the MedDRA coding dictionary current at the time 
of clinical trial reporting (version 17.1 for study 1275.10 and version 16.0 for study 1275.1(met)). 
The analysis of adverse events was based on treatment-emergent adverse events, i.e. those with an onset 
date between the first and the last intake of study medication plus 7 days. For the analyses of fatal adverse 
events and malignancy adverse events, data up to the last contact with the patient were included. For the 
analyses of hepatic injury adverse events and elevated transaminases, data up to 30 days after the last 
intake of study medication were included. 
Adverse event analyses were based on the number of patients with adverse events, not the number of 
adverse events. Analyses of adverse events adjusted for exposure (incidence rate per 100 patient years of 
time at risk) used patient-specific time at risk, i.e. the exposure until the onset of the event or, if the patient 
did not have an event, the entire time of exposure plus 7 days.

Patient exposure 
For all studies, the majority of the patients completed the treatment periods as planned. There were no 
relevant differences in the percentage of patients prematurely discontinuing from the trial medication 
between the treatment groups. Overall, the most common reasons for premature discontinuation were 
either adverse events or patients being lost to follow-up.

were based on the treated set. 
Overview of adverse events in study 1275.10 
In study 1275.10, the numbers of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on treatment were similar 
between the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) and corresponding placebo groups 
(Table 25). The proportion of patients reported with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
and serious adverse events was overall low and similar between all treatment groups. No patient died during

Overview of adverse events in study 1275.1(met) 
In study 1275.1(met), the proportions of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on treatment were 
similar between treatment groups (Table 26). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were 
reported more frequently in the empagliflozin 10 mg group than in the other treatment groups. The 
proportion of patients reported with serious adverse events was overall low and similar between all 
treatment groups. Two cases of deaths were reported on-treatment: 1 patient died in the empagliflozin 10 
mg/linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to metformin) treatment group and 1 patient in the empagliflozin 10 mg 
(add-on to metformin) treatment group. For a detailed description of the different types of adverse events,

Common adverse events 
Most frequent adverse events 
The frequencies of patients with adverse events in the add-on design study 1275.10 were generally slightly 
lower in the linagliptin (add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) group than in the corresponding placebo 
group. In the factorial design study 1275.1, the frequencies of patients with adverse events were similar 
across all treatment groups. Most frequent adverse events in all studies were infections (urinary tract or 
upper respiratory tract).  
Most frequent adverse events in study 1275.10 
The frequencies of patients with adverse events in study 1275.10 were lower in each of the linagliptin 5 mg 
(add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) groups than in their corresponding placebo groups. At PT level, 
patients were most frequently reported with urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and increased lipase. 
For most PTs, the frequency was balanced between treatment groups. Patients were less frequently reported 
with nasopharyngitis and hyperglycaemia in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and 
metformin) group, than in the corresponding placebo group. Patients were more frequently reported with 
nasopharyngitis in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) group than in the 
corresponding placebo group (Table 27).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
In the add-on trial 1275.10, no patients had a fatal adverse event with an onset date during the open-label 
or on-treatment periods. However, 1 patient who had been in the placebo group had a fatal adverse event 
with an onset post-treatment and 1 patient who had been in the linagliptin group had a fatal adverse event 
with an onset post-study. In both cases, the preferred term for the adverse event was pancreatic carcinoma. 
In the factorial design trial 1275.1(met), there were 2 patients who had fatal adverse events with an onset 
date during the on-treatment period; a patient in the empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg fixed-dose 
combination group died of hypertensive heart disease and a patient in the empagliflozin 10 mg group died of 
lung neoplasm; the latter patient was also reported with the fatal adverse event metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer with an onset posttreatment.

None of the deaths were considered as drug-related.

treatment group – TS 
Serious adverse events 
In this section, an analysis of all serious adverse events is presented in detail.  
The frequencies of patients with serious adverse events in the add-on design studies were overall lower in 
the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) group than in the corresponding placebo group. 
In the factorial design study, the frequencies of patients with adverse events were overall similar across all 
treatment groups. 
Serious adverse events in study 1275.10 
In study 1275.10, the frequencies of patients with serious adverse events were low (<4%) and similar 
across treatment groups. Three patients (2.7%) were reported with serious adverse events in the linagliptin 
5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin), 4 patients (3.6%) in the placebo (add-on to 
empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin), 4 patients (3.2%) in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 
mg and metformin), and 5 patients (3.9%) in the placebo (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) 
group. In the patient population taking linagliptin 5 mg or placebo as add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and 
metformin, the highest frequency of serious adverse events at SOC level was infections and infestations (0% 
of patients in the linagliptin 5 mg and 1.8% of patients in the placebo group). Except for osteomyelitis in the 
placebo (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin) group (reported for 2 patients [1.8%]), serious 
adverse events at PT level were not reported for more than 1 patient per treatment group. In the patient 
population taking linagliptin 5 mg or placebo as add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin, the highest 
frequency of serious adverse events at SOC level was musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2 
patients [1.6%] in each treatment group), infections and infestations (2 patients [1.6%] in the linagliptin 5 
mg treatment group), and gastrointestinal disorders (2 patients [1.6%] in the linagliptin 5 mg treatment 
group). Serious adverse events at PT level were not reported for more than 1 patient per treatment group. 
Serious adverse events in study 1275.1(met) 
In study 1275.1(met), the frequency of patients with serious adverse events was <8% and similar across 
treatment groups. Six patients (4.4%) were reported with serious adverse events in the empagliflozin 25 
mg/linagliptin 5 mg, 10 patients (7.1%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg, 9 patients (6.6%) in the empagliflozin 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 59/80 
 
  
  
 
 
 
10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, 6 patients (4.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg, and 8 patients (6.1%) in the linagliptin 
5 mg group. At PT level, for none of the serious adverse events more than 1 patient was reported in any of 
the treatment groups . 
Other significant adverse events 
Other significant adverse events, as defined in ICH E3 and reported in this document, are marked 
haematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other than those meeting the definition of ‘serious’) and 
any event that led to an intervention, including withdrawal of test drug treatment, dose reduction, or 
significant additional concomitant therapy, other than those reported as serious adverse events. Dose 
reduction was not allowed according to the study protocols. Serious adverse events are not included in ‘other 
significant adverse events’; all adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication (i.e. including 
serious events) are presented above.  
Overall, less than 6% of the patients per treatment group were reported with other significant adverse 
events in all Phase III studies. At PT level, each other significant adverse event was reported for not more 
than 1 patient (0% to 0.9%) per treatment group. 
Other significant adverse events in study 1275.10 
In study 1275.10, 2 patients (1.8%) were reported with other significant adverse events in the linagliptin 5 
mg (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin) group (PT urinary tract infection and dysphagia), 2 
patients (1.8%) in the placebo (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin) group (PT bronchitis, 
hyperglycaemia, and vulvovaginal pruritus), 2 patients (1.6%) were reported with other significant adverse 
events in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) group (PT urinary tract 
infection, amylase increased, and lipase increased), and 3 patients (2.3%) in the placebo (add-on to 
empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) group (PT urinary tract infection, cough, and upper abdominal pain). 
Other significant adverse events in study 1275.1(met) 
In study 1275.1(met), 2 patients (1.5%) each were reported with other significant adverse events in the 
empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, and the linagliptin 5 mg group 
(all as add-on to metformin), 3 patients (2.1%) were reported with other significant adverse events in the 
empagliflozin 25 mg (add-on to metformin) group, and 7 patients (5.0%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg 
(add-on to metformin) group. 
Analysis of adverse events of special interest 
Based on the mode of action and known safety profile of DPP-4 inhibitors, safety data were searched for 
adverse events of special interest. The search was based on SMQs or, when no appropriate SMQ was 
available, on BIcMQs (BI-customised MedDRA queries). Adverse events of special interest comprise: renal 
adverse events, hepatic adverse events, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, 
pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. The overview of adverse events of special interest presented by the 
company is based on the add-on trial 1275.10.  
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 60/80 
 
  
  
 
 
Renal adverse events 
Only 2 patients (0.8%) in each treatment group were reported with renal adverse events. There were small 
fluctuations in mean eGFR and eCCr values over time but no clinically meaningful differences between the 
linagliptin and placebo groups. There were also no meaningful differences between treatment groups with 
regard to the proportions of patients who shifted into worse or better renal function categories based on 
eGFR values. 
Hepatic adverse events 
No patient had on-treatment central laboratory values consistent with biochemical Hy's law constellation 
(ALT and/or AST ≥3x ULN with concomitant or subsequent total bilirubin ≥2x ULN within 30 days after 
ALT/AST elevation; the maximum alkaline phosphatase value in the 30-day period <2x ULN) during the 
double-blind treatment period. One patient, in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and 
metformin) group, was reported with such a laboratory constellation based on local laboratory data, but 
these values could not be confirmed by the central laboratory. The adjudication committee classified the 
event as a mild to moderate hepatic injury with a possible causal relationship with the study medication, but 
not as a Hy’s law case.  
The frequency of patients with ALT and/or AST ≥3x and <5x ULN during the double-blind treatment period 
was low (not more than 1 patient per treatment group; 0 to 0.9%,Table 30). No patient had values above 5x 
ULN during the double-blind treatment period.

One patient, in the placebo (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) group, had an ALT/AST increase 
of ≥10x ULN from baseline during the 30 days after last dose of study medication. Severe cutaneous adverse 
reactions. 
One patient (0.4%), in the linagliptin group, was reported with a severe cutaneous adverse reaction. The 
event was bullous dermatitis and led to discontinuation of study medication. 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 61/80 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity 
There were 3 patients (1.3%) in each treatment group who were reported with hypersensitivity reactions. In 
the linagliptin group, the reported events were bullous dermatitis, rash, and urticaria. In the placebo group, 
the reported events were eczema, hypersensitivity and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Pancreatitis 
One patient (0.4%) in the linagliptin group was reported with pancreatitis. The event was acute pancreatitis 
and led to discontinuation of study medication. 
Pancreatic cancer 
Although no patients were reported with pancreatic cancer during the double-blind treatment period, there 
were 2 patients reported with pancreatic carcinoma after the end of treatment; 1 patient in the linagliptin 
group was reported with pancreatic carcinoma in the post-study period and 1 patient in the placebo group 
was reported with pancreatic carcinoma in the post-treatment period. Both of these events were fatal.  
Other adverse events of interest 
A number of other adverse events were identified as being of interest for the analyses of safety. The search 
was based on SMQs or, when no appropriate SMQ was available, on BIcMQs (BI-customised MedDRA 
queries). The overview of further selected adverse events is based on the add-on trial 1275.10; for 
malignancies, events from the factorial design trial 1275.1(met) are also included. 
Hypoglycaemic adverse events 
Hypoglycaemia is a labelled side effect of both linagliptin (when combined with metformin and a 
sulphonylurea) and empagliflozin (when combined with a sulphonylurea or insulin) and is of general interest 
in studies on diabetes. In total, 2 patients (0.8%) in the linagliptin group and 4 patients (1.7%) in the 
placebo group were reported with investigator-defined hypoglycaemia. Confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse 
events comprised all investigator-reported symptomatic and asymptomatic adverse events that had a 
plasma glucose value of ≤70 mg/dL or that required the assistance of another person. No patients in the 
linagliptin group and 3 patients (1.3%) in the placebo group were reported with confirmed hypoglycaemic 
events. Thus, there is no evidence that treatment with linagliptin as add-on therapy to empagliflozin and 
metformin increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.  
Malignancies 
Because type 2 diabetes mellitus may be associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer when 
compared with the general population, malignancies were considered of interest. An overview of 
malignancies from both trials 1275.10 and 1275.1(met) is provided here. There were 2 patients with 
malignancies reported in trial 1275.10; both were pancreatic carcinoma reported after the end of treatment 
and with fatal outcome. A further 11 patients in trial 1275.1(met) were reported with malignancies; these 
included 4 patients treated with linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin as add-on therapy to 
metformin. The reported malignancies were of several different tumour types and locations, without a clear 
trend for a certain tumour type or location. Out of the 13 patients reported with malignancies, 8 patients had 
malignancies with the onset date after 6 months of treatment. In accordance with previous regulatory 
guidance, a search for thyroid cancer in trial 1275.10 was conducted; no patients were reported with thyroid 
cancer.

Cardiac failure 
Cardiac failure is an identified potential risk associated with DPP-4 inhibitors. No patients in trial 1275.10 
were reported with cardiac failure. 
Lactic acidosis 
Lactic acidosis was analysed because it is a risk associated with metformin; the analysis of this selected 
adverse event is therefore relevant for the fixed-dose combination of linagliptin and metformin. No cases of 
lactic acidosis were reported in trial 1275.10. 
Laboratory findings 
The results for study 1275.10 summarised below are generally based on descriptive statistics of laboratory 
parameters at baseline and last value on treatment, frequency of changes with respect to the reference 
range from baseline to last value on treatment, and frequency of patients with possibly clinically significant 
abnormalities.  
Standard laboratory parameters (functional groups: haematology, differentials [automatic and absolute], 
electrolytes, enzymes, substrates [including serum lipids], plasma proteins, and urinalysis) were 
comparable at baseline and mean changes from baseline to the last value on treatment were generally small 
without clinically meaningful differences between the linagliptin and placebo groups.  
The frequency of shifts from within normal range at baseline to >ULN or to <LLN at last observation on 
treatment was generally low and similar between the 2 treatment groups. Some differences between the 
linagliptin and placebo groups for shifts to >ULN were noted for lipase (14.4% and 10.2%), triglycerides 
(9.0% and 5.2%), and urea (7.2% and 3.7%). 
Overall, the frequency of patients reported with possibly clinically significant abnormalities was low and 
comparable between treatment groups. Relatively high frequencies were reported for bicarbonate (possibly 
clinically significant low values – linagliptin: 15.9% of patients; placebo: 13.2% of patients), for lipase 
(possibly clinically significant high values – linagliptin: 11.9%; placebo: 9.2%), and for triglycerides 
(possibly clinically significant high values – linagliptin: 7.0%; placebo: 4.7%). 
Vital signs  
Baseline mean values for blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and pulse rate were comparable and changes from 
baseline to last value on treatment were small and similar in the linagliptin and placebo groups (pulse rate 
– linagliptin: +0.14 bpm, placebo: 0.27 bpm; systolic blood pressure – linagliptin:  0.10 mmHg, placebo: 
+0.15 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure – linagliptin: +0.02 mmHg, placebo: +0.79 mmHg  
Safety in special populations 
The following safety categories were analysed for subgroups of study 1275.10: all adverse events, adverse 
events leading to treatment discontinuation, serious adverse events, and adverse events assessed as 
drug-related by the investigator. As the overall number of events was very low for most of these categories, 
the following summary generally only includes all adverse events and serious adverse events with overall at 
least 2 patients with events in either treatment group of study 1275.10.

INTRINSIC FACTORS 
Age 
Only patients at least 18 years of age were included in study 1275.10. About 80% of the patients were 
younger than 65 years at baseline. Only around 17% were between 65 and 75 years, 3% were older than 
75 years, and 1 patient was older than 85 years (Table 31). Therefore results of subgroup analyses of 
patients older than 75 years are mostly inconclusive.  
In general, with increasing age, there was an increase in the proportions of patients reported with adverse 
events. Within each age category, the trends in the frequency of any adverse events and serious adverse 
events were consistent with those for the overall population.

Gender 
In study 1275.10, about half of the patients were men. Demographic data were largely similar for men and 
women. 
The frequency of patients with any adverse events was higher for women than for men in both treatment 
groups (Table 32). Within each gender, the trends in the frequency of any adverse events and serious 
adverse events were generally consistent with those for the overall population.

Renal function 
Based on eGFR (MDRD), renal function was categorised as normal (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2), mild renal 
impairment (60 to <90 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate A (45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate B (30 to <45 
mL/min/1.73m2), severe (<30 to 15 mL/min/1.73m2), or end stage (<15 mL/min/1.73m2).  
About half of the patients had normal renal function and the other half had mild renal impairment at 
baseline. Moderate or severe/end stage renal impairment was an exclusion criterion in study 1275.10. Very 
few patients (14 with moderate A and 2 with moderate B, none with severe/end stage renal impairment) are 
included in these subgroups, mostly because study inclusion was based on local calculation of renal function 
with the Cockcroft-Gault formula (and some discrepancies with MDRD occur at the boundaries of the renal 
impairment categories). Therefore only patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment at 
baseline are described in this section.  
Demographic data were overall similar between subgroups. In the placebo group the frequency of patients 
with any adverse event was higher for patients with mild renal impairment than for patients with normal 
renal function, whereas no difference was seen in the linagliptin group (Table 33). Within each renal 
impairment category, the trends in the frequency of any adverse events and serious adverse events were 
generally consistent with those for the overall population.

In both treatment groups the frequency of patients with any adverse events was higher in the subgroup with 
mild renal impairment (linagliptin: 56.3%, placebo: 65.3% of patients) than in the subgroup with normal 
renal function (linagliptin: 50.3%, placebo: 54.3%). Within each renal impairment category, the trends in 
the frequency of any adverse events and serious adverse events were generally consistent with those for the 
overall population. 
EXTRINSIC FACTORS 
Geographical region 
Subgroup analyses by region were performed for Europe, Latin America, and North America.  
In study 1275.10, nearly 50% of the patients were from Europe, about 20% were from North America and 
about 30% from Latin America. Demographic data were largely similar among regions. For patients from 
North America, the overall frequency of adverse events was higher for patients receiving placebo than for 
patients treated with linagliptin, whereas no treatment difference was seen for patients from Europe or Latin 
America (Table 34).  
Within each region, the trends in the frequency of any adverse events and serious adverse events were 
generally consistent with those for the overall population.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin were 
not influenced by co-administration with metformin and glibenclamide. Co-administration of linagliptin with 
ritonavir resulted in a moderate increase in peak linagliptin plasma concentrations area under the 
concentration-time curve. Co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin resulted in a moderate decrease 
and in peak linagliptin plasma concentrations area under the concentration-time curve. These changes were 
not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
The drug-drug interaction of empagliflozin and linagliptin was investigated in study 1245.30. The relative 
bioavailability of multiple doses of empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin 5 mg after their concomitant 
administration was compared to the bioavailabilities of multiple doses of empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin 
5 mg administered alone in healthy male volunteers. There was no clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of either drug and thus no evidence for a drug-drug interaction. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication  
The frequency of patients with adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication in 
the Phase III studies was <7% and similar across all treatment groups. At PT level, each adverse event 
leading to premature discontinuation of study medication was reported for not more than 1 patient (0 to 
0.9%) per treatment group in the add-on study 1275.10. 
In study 1275.10, 3 patients (2.7%) in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin), 
3 patients (2.7%) in the placebo (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin), 4 patients (3.2%) in the 
linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin), and 3 patients (2.3%) in the placebo 
(add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin) group were reported with adverse events leading to 
premature discontinuation of study medication. 
In study 1275.1(met), 3 patients (2.2%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, 4 patients (2.8%) in 
the empagliflozin 25 mg, 2 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg/ linagliptin 5 mg, 9 patients (6.4%) 
in the empagliflozin 10 mg, and 4 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group (all treatments as add-on to 
metformin) were reported with adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication. At 
PT level, each adverse event leading to premature discontinuation of study medication was reported for not 
more than 1 patient (0 to 0.8%) per treatment group, except for increased blood creatinine (2 patients 
[1.5%] in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg [add-on to metformin] group). 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of writing, linagliptin and the combination of linagliptin and metformin were not approved as 
add-on therapy to SGLT-2 inhibitors in the EU. However, the FDC empagliflozin/linagliptin had been 
approved (30 Jan 2015) and marketed in the US and been approved as Glyxambi on 11 November 2016 in 
the EU. In the US, no special safety measurements have been agreed with FDA, therefore standard safety 
monitoring procedures are being followed by the MAH. Several adverse events were reported to the MAH 
after the US marketing approval, but based on the post-marketing case reports no specific safety signal had 
been detected at the time of writing this summary.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment of linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin was based on data from the 2 Phase 
III clinical studies. 
Variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/215439/2017 
Page 68/80 
 
  
  
The MAH has conducted a large number of clinical studies for linagliptin. This AR focusses on the add on 
study of linagliptin to empagliflozin (study 1275.10), and factorial design study with linagliptin and 
empagliflozin (study 1275.1). In total, 1164 patients were treated in the double-blind periods of the studies. 
These included 478 patients from trial 1275.10; of these 238 patients were treated with linagliptin and 240 
patients were treated with placebo. A further 686 patients from trial 1275.1(met) are also included.  
In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment, linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin and 
metformin background therapy was well tolerated. The frequencies of patients with treatment-emergent 
adverse events were generally similar across treatment groups in all studies. In the add-on study 1275.10, 
an overall lower proportion of patients was reported with adverse events in the linagliptin (add-on to 
empagliflozin and metformin) groups than in the placebo group. In the study 1275.1 patient population, the 
frequencies of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on-treatment were similar in the 5 treatment 
groups. 
The frequencies of patients with serious adverse events were lower in the linagliptin treatment groups than 
in the placebo groups in the add-on study 1275.10, and similar across treatment groups in the factorial 
design study 1275.1.  
For the analyses of adverse events of special interest and other significant adverse events, the MAH 
summarizes data from study 1275.10. Of course, for the use of linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin, trial 
1275.10 is very relevant. However, the factorial design trial 1275.1(met) also provides information on the 
additional efficacy of linagliptin in patients that also use empagliflozin. Although this study uses initial 
combination therapy of linagliptin and empagliflozin, we consider safety data relevant for the safety 
assessment of the add-on indication.  
In the present Phase III studies, the frequency of patients with confirmed hypoglycaemic events was low. 
However, when taken together with insulin or sulphonylurea, both empagliflozin and linagliptin are 
associated with hypoglycaemia. In the present studies, empagliflozin and linagliptin were not investigated in 
combination with insulin or sulphonylurea. These indications were not specifically requested. In addition, it 
is not expected that combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin with sulfonylurea or insulin will lead to an 
additionally increased risk of hypoglycaemia because both components do not further reduce glucose in a 
hypoglycaemic state.  
In the SmPC for both linagliptin and empagliflozin, a reduction of the SU dose is recommended when adding 
these treatments. Based on the mechanism of action and the data provided, no added safety concerns of 
hypoglycaemia are to be expected when linagliptin and empagliflozin are used together. 
The Applicant acknowledges that the combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin has not been studied in 
patients receiving concomitant GLP-1 analogues or thiazolidinediones. Although the text of the new 
indication is relatively broad, the studied combinations are clearly described in 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The frequency of patients reported with hepatic adverse events or relevant laboratory findings was low and 
comparable across all treatment groups in each study. As expected, treatment with linagliptin was 
associated with small increases in lipase. This has been added to the SmPC. In the 2 studies, 1 patient was 
reported with pancreatitis. This patient was treated with linagliptin. Pancreatitis is identified as a possible 
risk with DPP-4 inhibitors.  
The frequencies of patients with decreased renal function adverse events was small and similar for all 
groups. There was no clinically relevant difference in the frequencies of patients reported with urinary tract 
infection across treatment groups in each study. 
There were no new signals with respect to hypersensitivity reactions, malignancy, cardiac failure and lactic 
acidosis were low, with no relevant differences between groups.  
There were no relevant effects of gender, race and renal function on adverse events.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin background therapy, treatment with the add-on 
therapy of linagliptin to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin was well tolerated and the safety profile was 
generally consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual components. In the factorial design 
study in patients uncontrolled on metformin monotherapy, the combination of linagliptin with empagliflozin 
was also well tolerated, with similar safety profiles to the individual components.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the changes 
proposed to the package leaflet can be considered minor and the absence of further user consultation can be 
justified. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The MAH did apply for an extension of indication for the combined use of linagliptin (a dipeptidylpeptidase 
[DPP-4] inhibitor) and of linagliptin/metformin with a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter-2 [SGLT-2] 
inhibitor for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Support for this indication consists of 2 
pivotal studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 1 add-on study (1275.10) with linagliptin as add on 
to a combination of metformin and empagliflozin and one factorial design study (1275.1). 
These studies were also part of the marketing authorisation of Glyxambi, the FDC of empagliflozin and 
linagliptin (EMEA/H/C/003833). Glyxambi was authorised in the EU for use in patients with type 2 diabetes 
in November 2016. 
The Phase III add-on study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin as add-on therapy 
to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin (study 1275.10) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
metformin background medication. In the factorial design study, patients were randomised into 5 treatment 
groups: empa 25/lina 5, empa 10/lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5 (1275.1). The superiority of each 
FDC was tested against its respective individual components. Bioequivalence of the FDC with the individual 
components was established. No drug-drug-interactions between the monocomponents were observed. 
Although the factorial design study does not investigate the add-on indication, this study provides 
information on the combined use of linagliptin and empagliflozin.  
Linagliptin had previously been indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic 
control in adults as monotherapy in patients for whom metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindicated due to renal impairment, and as combination therapy in combination with metformin, 
sulphonylurea and metformin, and insulin with or without metformin. In this application the MAH requested 
an extension of the indication, and proposes that linagliptin is also indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults in combination with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin when 
diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control. An equivalent extension of indication was requested for the FDC linagliptin/metformin. 
In total, 1164 patients were treated in the double-blind periods of the two studies. These included 478 
patients from the add-on trial 1275.10; of these 238 patients were treated with linagliptin and 240 patients 
were treated with placebo. A further 686 patients from the factorial design trial 1275.1(met) are also 
included. The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups.

In the add-on study 1275.10, the treatment effect of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.47% 
(95% CI: -0.66, -0.28) and the effect of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin 10 mg was -0.32% (95% CI: 
-0.52, -0.13). The pooled treatment difference of linagliptin was -0.40% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.27; p<0.0001).  
In the factorial design study 1275.1 (met), the treatment difference for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group was 
-0.58% (95% CI: -0.75, -0.41) versus empa 25 and the treatment difference for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 
group was  -0.42% (95% CI: -0.59, -0.25) versus empa 10.  
In general, the results for changes in FPG were consistent with the results for the changes in HbA1c.  
As could be expected based on linagliptin's mechanism of action, linagliptin in combination with 
empagliflozin in study 1275.10 was not associated with statistically significant changes in body weight in 
comparison to placebo. In study 1275.01 (met), linagliptin was also not associated with weight loss.  
In study 1275.10, linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin (25 mg and 10 mg) and metformin provided no 
reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. In 
study 1275.1, there were also no changes in blood pressure with linagliptin treatment.  
In general, in study 1275.1, the effects after 52 weeks were in line with the findings after 24 weeks.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
As described above, the treatment effects of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin were small (1275.10; 
(-0.47% on top of empa 25 mg and -0.32% on top of empa 10 mg). As requested, the company performed 
a subgroup analyses in study 1275.10 in patients with HbA1c greater than or equal to 8.5%. In these 
patients, the adjusted mean treatment differences for linagliptin to placebo in study 1275.10 were clinically 
relevant (-0.62%) as add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin, but of borderline clinical relevance 
(-0.33%) as add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin.  
Additional data showing the efficacy of linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin (on a background of 
metformin) was provided by the factorial design study 1275.1(met). In this study, the treatment difference 
between the combination of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg was -0.58%). 
Similarly, the treatment difference between the combination of empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and 
empagliflozin 10 mg was -0.42%. Taken together, the data from study 1275.10 and 1275.1(met) suggest 
that the additive effect of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin and metformin is on average approximately 
0.45% and of clinical relevance. 
Study 1275.10 also included an analysis of the proportions of patients who achieved an HbA1c value of 7% 
or lower at 24 weeks. The analysis showed that more than twice as many patients treated with linagliptin 
than with placebo achieved HbA1c<7.0% after 24 weeks. For linagliptin as add on to empagliflozin 25 mg, 
responder percentages were 36% vs. 15%. For linagliptin as add on to empagliflozin 10 mg, responder 
percentages were 26% vs. 11%.  
Similarly, responder analyses in the factorial design study 1275.1(met) demonstrate that linagliptin in 
combination with empagliflozin was associated with higher responder percentages than with empagliflozin 
monotherapy (64.9% and 60.0% for linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin 25 mg and 10 mg 
respectively vs. 35.7% and 34.3% for empagliflozin 25 mg and 10 mg respectively). 
Empagliflozin is the only SGLT2-inhibitor for which the combination with linagliptin was investigated. A 
combination of lina with other SGLT2-inhibitors has not been studied. This is described in SmPC section 5.1. 
The study populations can be considered relatively representative of the target population. However, due to 
the fact that empagliflozin and metformin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few 
patients with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥75 years old were 
included.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment of linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin was also based on data from the add 
on study of linagliptin to empagliflozin (study 1275.10), and factorial design study with linagliptin and 
empagliflozin (study 1275.1). In total, 1164 patients were treated in the double-blind periods of the studies 
included in the evaluation presented in this document.  
In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment, linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin and 
metformin background therapy was well tolerated. The frequencies of patients with treatment-emergent 
adverse events were generally similar across treatment groups in all studies. In the add-on study 1275.10, 
an overall lower proportion of patients was reported with adverse events in the linagliptin (add-on to 
empagliflozin and metformin) groups than in the placebo group. In the study 1275.1 patient population, the 
frequencies of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on-treatment were similar in the 5 treatment 
groups. 
The frequencies of patients with serious adverse events were lower in the linagliptin treatment groups than 
in the placebo groups in the add-on study 1275.10, and similar across treatment groups in the factorial 
design study 1275.1.  
The frequencies of patients with decreased renal function adverse events was small and similar for all 
groups. There was no clinically relevant difference in the frequencies of patients reported with urinary tract 
infection across treatment groups in each study. 
There were no new signals with respect to hypersensitivity reactions, malignancy, cardiac failure and lactic 
acidosis were low, with no relevant differences between groups.  
There were no relevant effects of gender, race and renal function on adverse events. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the present Phase III studies, the frequency of patients with confirmed hypoglycaemic events was low. 
However, when taken together with insulin or sulphonylurea, both empagliflozin and linagliptin are 
associated with hypoglycaemia. In the present studies, empagliflozin and linagliptin were not investigated in 
combination with insulin or sulphonylurea. Concomitant use of linagliptin with empagliflozin and glucagon 
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues or thiazolidinediones has also not been studied.   
The frequency of patients reported with hepatic adverse events or relevant laboratory findings was low and 
comparable across all treatment groups in each study. As expected, treatment with linagliptin was 
associated with small increases in lipase. This has been added to the text of the SmPC. In the 2 studies, 1 
patient was reported with pancreatitis. This patient was treated with linagliptin. Pancreatitis is identified as 
a possible risk with DPP-4 inhibitors.  
Empagliflozin is the only SGLT2-inhibitor for which the combination with linagliptin was investigated. A 
combination of lina with other SGLT2-inhibitors has not been studied. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The effects of linagliptin as add on to empagliflozin on HbA1c were relatively small, but clinically relevant. In 
addition, linagliptin was associated with small reductions in fasting plasma glucose. As expected, linagliptin 
was not associated with reductions in body weight and blood pressure. No information regarding the

modulation of cardiovascular risk with linagliptin is currently known as a cardiovascular outcome trial with 
linagliptin is ongoing.  
The differences between SGLT-2 inhibitors may not be very large. Nevertheless, empagliflozin is the only 
SGLT2-inhibitor for which the combination with linagliptin was investigatedwhich is described in the SmPC 
section 5.1.  
Due to the fact that empagliflozin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few patients 
with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥75 years old were included. This 
may limit the external validity of the studies to the total population.  
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin background therapy, treatment with the add-on 
therapy of linagliptin to the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin was well tolerated and the safety profile was 
generally consistent with the known safety profile. In the factorial design study in patients uncontrolled on 
metformin monotherapy, the combination of linagliptin with empagliflozin was also well tolerated, with 
similar safety profiles to the individual components.  
Patients with type 2 diabetes can be treated with empagliflozin in combination  with SU and insulin. The 
concomitant  use  of  linagliptin  with  empagliflozin  and  sulphonylurea  derivatives  or  insulin  has  not  been 
studied;  for  which  there  may  be  an  increased  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  In  addition,  concomitant  use  of 
linagliptin with empagliflozin and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues or thiazolidinediones has also 
not been studied. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Treatment with linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin and metformin was well tolerated and the safety 
profiles were generally consistent with the known safety profile. The HbA1c lowering effect of linagliptin in 
combination with empagliflozin and metformin was small, but relevant. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The clinical relevance of the effect of linagliptin as add on to empagliflozin and metformin is modest, but 
acceptable. Responder percentages were clearly higher. The combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin 
might be beneficial for certain patients.  
The fact that only a few patients ≥75 years old were included limits the external validity of the trial to the 
total population. In addition, only a few patients with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. However, the 
separate clinical development programs for the monocomponents linagliptin and empagliflozin include more 
patients within this age category. Although the issue remains that there is limited knowledge on the efficacy 
and safety of the combination linagliptin and empagliflozin in these patients, this is sufficiently reflected in 
the SmPC. The concomitant use of linagliptin and empagliflozin was not investigated in combination with 
insulin, sulphonylurea, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues or thiazolidinediones . It is not expected 
that combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin with sulfonylurea or insulin will lead to an additionally 
increased risk of hypoglycaemia because both components do not further reduce glucose in a hypoglycaemic 
state.  
In the SmPC for both linagliptin and empagliflozin, a reduction of the SU dose is recommended when adding 
these treatments. Based on the mechanism of action and the data provided, no added safety concerns of 
hypoglycaemia are to be expected when linagliptin and empagliflozin or another SGLT-2 inhibitor are used 
together. 
Empagliflozin is the only SGLT2-inhibitor for which the combination was investigated. This is described in the 
SmPC section 5.1.The combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin has not been studied in patients receiving 
concomitant GLP-1 analogues or thiazolidinediones.

Since the initial authorisation of linagliptin-containing products, the general wording of the indication for 
medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes has evolved, and in addition more data has been 
accumulated regarding the combined use of linagliptin with other products for the treatment of diabetes 
representing the standard of care. Therefore, the wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC refers 
now in more general terms to the combined use of linagliptin and linagliptin/metformin with other products 
for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin. Although the wording of the indication is relatively broad, the 
combinations studied are clearly described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for axitinib, the scientific conclusions of 
CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of the data submitted in the PSUR procedure, including case reports and one 
literature article, and considering that a plausible biological mechanism exists, there is at least a 
reasonable possibility that axitinib may cause cholecystitis. Therefore, the product information should be 
updated to include cholecystitis as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the PL, with 
frequency ‘common’.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for axitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing axitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

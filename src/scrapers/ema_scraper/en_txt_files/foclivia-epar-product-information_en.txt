PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. 
Milky-white liquid.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. 
Foclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 6 months of age and older: administer two doses (0.5 ml each), 21 days apart. 
Data on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited 
(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No data are available in children aged less than 6 months. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the 
thigh in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older individuals.  
4.3  Contraindications 
History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues 
(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, 
hydrocortisone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. 
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a 
history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately 
available in case of need. See section 4.4. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity to the 
active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to residues (eggs, chicken proteins, 
ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone and 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness 
until the fever is resolved. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Immunocompromised individuals, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic 
defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced immune response to active immunisation. 
The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There 
are no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to 
assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless 
the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. 
Protection against influenza 
There is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.  
Some degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to 
that of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of 
other clades is unknown (see section 5.1). 
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with 
other H5N1 monovalent vaccines.

While no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have 
been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine 
similar to Foclivia. 
The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in 
subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from 
epilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience 
convulsion. (see section 4.8). 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response 
to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’ 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Foclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation 
should be carried out on separate limbs. 
There are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal 
influenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be 
carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Limited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with 
Foclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-
associated risks in pregnancy. 
However, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were 
vaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which 
contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse 
events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria 
exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of 
Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, 
abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations 
among almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated 
controls. 
Health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine 
to pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks 
to the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. 
Fertility 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive 
or developmental toxicity of Foclivia (see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Foclivia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (7.5 or 15 micrograms haemagglutinin, 
HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain has been 
evaluated in nine clinical trials in healthy subjects involving 5055 adults, elderly and children. There 
were 4041 adult subjects 18 to 60 years of age and 540 elderly subjects 61 years of age and above. In 
the paediatric population, there were 214 subjects 6 to 35 months of age, 167 subjects 3 to 8 years of 
age and 93 subjects 9 to 17 years of age. 
The overall safety profile was similar across the adult, elderly and paediatric populations.  
Clinical trials in 383 subjects receiving MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine with an H1N1, H5N3 or H9N2 
strain showed a similar safety profile to the H5N1 trials. 
Irrespective of antigen dose, antigen subtype or age group, most local and systemic adverse reactions 
after administration were of short duration, with onset close to the time of vaccination, and were mild 
or moderate in severity. Across all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of local 
adverse reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In adults 18 to 60 years, the most frequently reported (≥10%) adverse reactions were injection site pain 
(59%), myalgia (34%), headache (26%), injection site redness (24%), fatigue (24%), injection site 
induration (21%), injection site swelling (15%), chills (13%) and maliase (13%). 
In elderly subjects (≥ 61 years), the most frequently reported (≥10%) adverse reactions were injection 
site pain (35%), myalgia (24%), injection site redness (17%), headache (16%), chills (12%), 
fatigue (10%) and malaise (10%).  
In children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age, the most frequently reported (≥10%) adverse 
reactions were injection site pain (95%), headache (61%), myalgia (60%), fatigue (41%), injection site 
redness (60%), injection site induration (34%), injection site swelling (34%), malaise (32%), 
nausea (25%), sweating (18%), chills (19%), diarrhoea (18%) and injection site ecchymosis (16%).  
In infants and children 6 to 35 months of age, the most frequently reported (≥10%) adverse reactions 
were injection site redness (62%), irritability (57%), tenderness (55%), unusual crying (48%), 
sleepiness (45%), injection site induration (38%), injection site swelling (37%) change in eating habits 
(36%), diarrhoea (34%), fever (27%), injection site ecchymosis (19%), vomiting (10%), sweating, 
(10%) and unusual sweating (10%).  
The solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions reported after any vaccination dose (i.e. first, second or 
booster) across subjects age, are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and 
system organ class: 
Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare

The majority of these reactions usually disappear within 3 days without treatment. 
Clinical trials in special populations 
Adverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and 
V87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or 
with underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. 
Across studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and 
elderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in 
immunocompromised subjects 18 to 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) were 
reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and elderly 
subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions.

The following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported 
with the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 
irrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and 
vomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive 
conditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy 
subjects (irrespective of age).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Pandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the 
currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and 
simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data 
obtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be 
used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness 
vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. 
Immune response to H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain. 
Adults (18-60 years) 
A Phase II clinical trial (V87P1) was conducted with H5N1  MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing 7.5 micrograms 
Haemagglutinin(HA)/dose were administered three weeks apart to 156 subjects. Immunogenicity was 
assessed in 149 subjects. 
In a phase III clinical trial (V87P13), 2693 adult subjects were enrolled and 2566 received two doses of 
H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 7.5 micrograms HA/dose 
administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (N=197) of subjects. 
In a third clinical trial (V87P11) 194 adult subjects received two doses of H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted 
vaccine containing A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 7.5 micrograms HA/dose administered three weeks apart. 
Immunogenicity was assessed in 182 subjects.

Seroprotection: SRH area ≥25 mm2 
Seroconversion was defined as an SRH area ≥25 mm2 for subjects who were seronegative at baseline (Day 1 SRH 
area ≤4 mm2) or a significant (at least 50%) increase in SRH area for subjects who were seropositive at baseline (Day 
1 SRH area >4 mm2) 
geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of SRH 
MicroNeutralization (MN) results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (Studies V87P1 and V87P13) 
indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% 
(58-72) to 83% (77-89), respectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line 
with results obtained with SRH. 
In Study V87P11 MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroprotection 
and seroconversion rate of 85% (79-90) and 93% (89-96), respectively. Immune response to 
vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained with SRH. 
Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by 
Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI), SRH, and MN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained at 
day 43 after completion of primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced 
by 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels.

MN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (Studies V87P1 and V87P13) indicate a seroprotection and 
seroconversion rate ranging from 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) 
respectively. MN results, similar to SRH results, demonstrated strong immune response after 
completion of priming vaccination series in a population of elderly subjects. 
In Study V87P11, MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroprotection 
and seroconversion rate of 68% (59-75) and 81% (74-87), respectively. Immune response to 
vaccination assessed by MN assay is similar to SRH results. 
Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN 
tests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5 of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after 
completion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% (N=33) of the 
elderly subjects aged 62 to 88 years immunised with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in trial V87P1 were seroprotected at six months. 
A third (booster) dose of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 was administered 6 months after the 
primary vaccination series. Results are shown by SRH.

Supportive data in adult and elderly populations 
In two dose finding studies 80 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N3 or 
H9N2). Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages 
(7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. 
Serum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates.

Serologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved 
seroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections. The adjuvanted vaccine 
was also found to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated 
in 2003 and 2004, which exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. 
Two doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages 
(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart. Serologic responses 
obtained with the HI assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% 
seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections.

in elderly. 
Long term booster immune memory: 
A single vaccination with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine induced high 
and rapid serological response in subjects primed 6to 8 years previously with two doses of a different 
vaccine, having the same formulation but using the H5N3 strain. 
In a phase I clinical trial (V87P3) adult subjects aged 18 to 65 years primed 6 to 8 years previously 
with 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine/A/Duck/Singapore/97, were administered 2 booster 
doses of H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine. SRH results after the first dose, 
that mimic prepandemic priming plus single heterologous booster dose, revealed seroprotection and 
seroconversion rates of 100% (74- 100) and an 18-fold increase in SRH area (GMR).   
Alternative vaccination schedules: 
In a clinical trial evaluating 4 different vaccination schedules in 240 subjects 18 to 60 years of age, 
where the second dose occurred either 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks after the first dose of H5N1 MF59C.1 
adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine, all vaccine schedule groups after 3 weeks from the 2nd 
vaccination achieved high levels of antibodies as evaluated with SRH. SRH seroprotection rates 
ranged from 86% to 98%, seroconversion rates from 64% to 90%, and GMR ranged from 2.92 to 4.57. 
The magnitude of immune response was lower in the group who received the second dose 1 week later 
and higher in the groups with longer interval schedules. 
Subjects with underlying medical or immunosuppressive conditions: 
Immunogenicity of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in adults (18 to 60 years) and elderly (>61 years) 
subjects with underlying medical conditions (Study V87_25) or immunosuppressive conditions 
(mainly HIV-infected subjects) (Study V87_26) in comparison to healthy adults (18-60 years) and 
elderly (>61 years), was evaluated in two randomised, phase III controlled clinical trials (with a 
seasonal trivalent inactivated MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine approved for use in elderly 
subjects 65 years of age and older as a comparator). In trial V87_25 and V87_26, 96 and 67 subjects, 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively, were over the age of 70 years. In both trials, immunogenicity of

HI results for the two clinical studies revealed lower values than those reported in previous studies. 
Seroconversion rates against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 ranged from 37.50% to 43.10% in 
healthy adults, and from 19.18% to 26.47% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical 
conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 21.43% to 30.65% in healthy elderly 
subjects, and from 24.49% to 27.86% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroconversion rate of 66.67% in 
healthy adults, and ranging from 33.57% to 54.14% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 24.39% to 29.03% in healthy 
elderly subjects, and from 31.65% to 39.42% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or 
underlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
In both studies V87_25 and V87_26, the lower levels of antibodies (as measured by HI, SRH and MN 
assays) and reduced seroprotection rates in adults and elderly (≥ 61 years old) subjects with underlying 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medical or immunosuppressive conditions, suggest that H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 may not elicit 
the same level of protection against A/H5N1 strain as compared to healthy adults (see section 4.4). 
These studies provided limited immunogenicity data in subjects with some underlying medical (in 
particular, renal impairment and peripheral cardiovascular disease) and immunosuppressive conditions 
(in particular, transplant recipients and patients under cancer treatment). In these trials, lower levels of 
antibodies and reduced seroprotection rates against homologous H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were 
also measured in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to healthy adults, though previous studies 
showed induction of sufficiently immunogenic responses against H5N1 strains (see above for 
information on elderly). 
Paediatric population 
The immunogenicity of aH5N1 in the paediatric population was assessed in Studies V87P6 and 
V87_30. 
Study V87P6 was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined with 
MF59C.1 adjuvant in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses of 7.5 micrograms 
were administered three weeks apart and a third dose 12 months following the first dose. 
After 3 weeks from the second vaccination (day 43) all age groups (i.e. 6 to 35 months, 3 to 8 years 
and 9 to 17 years) achieved high levels of antibodies to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 as evaluated with SRH 
and HI assays as presented in table below.

Study V87_30 was a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre study to measure the immunogenicity of 
six formulations in terms of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and MF59 adjuvant ratio. In this study, 
420 paediatric subjects 6 months to 8 years of age were divided into two age cohorts: 6 to 35 months 
of age (N=210) and 3 to 8 years of age (N=210). 
The vaccine was administered in two separate injections given 3 weeks apart. Antibody levels against 
A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were measured by HI and MN assays three weeks after the second 
vaccination (Day 43). The immunological response for the the approved formulation (7.5 micrograms 
HA with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml dose) and the study formulation with half the antigen content 
(3.75 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjvant, 0.5 ml dose), are presented below.

Immunogenicity results with Focetria H1N1v (Study V111_03): 
The seroprotection rate and seroconversion rate measured by HI assay and the seroconversion factor 
expressed as geometric mean ratio of HI for anti-HA antibody to H1N1 after administration of one and 
two 7.5 micrograms doses of Focetria was evaluated in 70 children and adolescents (9 to 
17 years), 60 children (3 to 8 years), 58 children (12 to 35 months) and 49 infants (6 to 11 months). 
CHMP immunogenicity criteria set for adults (18 to 60 years) were met both after the first and 
the second dose in all the above age strata (both in the overall population and in the subset 
seronegative at baseline). 
The European medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Foclivia in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in active immunisation against 
H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Foclivia has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. 
This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation  
Foclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 6 months of age and older: administer two doses (0.5 ml each), 21 days apart. 
Data on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
No data are available in children aged less than 6 months. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the 
thigh in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older individuals. 
4.3  Contraindications 
History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues 
(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, 
hydrocortisone  and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine.  
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a 
history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately 
available in case of need. See section 4.4. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity to the 
active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to residues (eggs, chicken proteins, 
ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone and 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness 
until the fever is resolved. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Immunocompromised individuals, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic 
defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced immune response to active immunisation. 
The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There 
are no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to 
assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless 
the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. 
Protection against influenza 
There is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.  
Some degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to 
that of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of 
other clades is unknown (see section 5.1). 
That there are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia 
with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have 
been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine 
similar to Foclivia. 
The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in 
subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from 
epilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience 
convulsion. (see section 4.8). 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Excipients with known effect  
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’ 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Foclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation 
should be carried out on separate limbs. 
There are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal 
influenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be 
carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Limited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with 
Foclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-
associated risks in pregnancy. 
However, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were 
vaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which 
contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse 
events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria 
exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of 
Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, 
abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations 
among almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated 
controls. 
Health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine 
to pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks 
to the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
There are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive 
or developmental toxicity of Foclivia (see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Foclivia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some Some 
of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of  H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (7.5 or 15 micrograms 
haemagglutinin, HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 
strain has been evaluated in nine clinical trials in healthy subjects involving 5055 adults, elderly and 
children. There were 4041 adult subjects 18 to 60 years of age and 540 elderly subjects 61 years of age 
and above. In the paediatric population, there were 214 subjects 6 to 35 months of age, 167 subjects 3 
to 8 years of age and 93 subjects 9 to 17 years of age. 
The  overall safety profile was similar across the adult, elderly and paediatric populations. 
Clinical trials in 383 subjects receiving MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine with an H1N1, H5N3 or H9N2 
strain showed a similar safety profile to the H5N1 trials. 
Irrespective of antigen dose, antigen subtype or age group, most local and systemic adverse reactions 
after administration were of short duration, with onset close to the time of vaccination, and were mild 
or moderate in severity. Across all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of local 
adverse reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Clinical trials in special populations 
Adverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and 
V87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or 
with underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. 
Across studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and 
elderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immunocompromised subjects 18 to 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) were 
reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and elderly 
subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. 
The following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported 
with the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 
irrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and 
vomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive 
conditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy 
subjects (irrespective of age).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Pandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the 
currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and 
simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data 
obtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be 
used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness 
vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. 
Immune response to H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain. 
Adults (18-60 years) 
A Phase II clinical trial (V87P1) was conducted with  H5N1  MF59C.1 
adjuvanted  vaccine  containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine co
ntaining  7.5 micrograms Haemagglutinin(HA)/dose were administered three weeks apart 
to 156 subjects. Immunogenicity was assessed in 149 subjects. 
In a phase III clinical trial (V87P13), 2693 adult subjects were enrolled and 2566 received two doses of 
H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 7.5 micrograms HA/dose 
administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (N=197) of subjects. 
In a third clinical trial (V87P11) 194 adult subjects received two doses of H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted 
vaccine containing A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 7.5 micrograms HA/dose administered three weeks apart. 
Immunogenicity was assessed in 182 subjects.

Seroprotection: SRH area ≥25 mm2 
Seroconversion was defined as an SRH area ≥25 mm2 for subjects who were seronegative at baseline (Day 1 SRH 
area ≤4 mm2) or a significant (at least 50%) increase in SRH area for subjects who were seropositive at baseline (Day 
1 SRH area >4 mm2) 
geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of SRH 
MicroNeutralization (MN) results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (Studies V87P1 and V87P13) 
indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% 
(58-72) to 83% (77-89), respectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line 
with results obtained with SRH. 
In Study V87P11 MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroprotection 
and seroconversion rate of 85% (79-90) and 93% (89-96), respectively. Immune response to 
vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained with SRH. 
Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by 
Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI), SRH, and MN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained at 
day 43 after completion of primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced 
by 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels.

MN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (Studies V87P1 and V87P13) indicate a seroprotection and 
seroconversion rate ranging from 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) 
respectively. MN results, similar to SRH results, demonstrated strong immune response after 
completion of priming vaccination series in a population of elderly subjects. 
In Study V87P11, MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroprotection 
and seroconversion rate of 68% (59-75) and 81% (74-87), respectively. Immune response to 
vaccination assessed by MN assay is similar to SRH results. 
Persistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN 
tests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5 of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after 
completion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% (N=33) of the 
elderly subjects aged 62 to 88 years immunised with H5N1  MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in trial V87P1 were seroprotected at six months. 
A third (booster) dose of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 was administered 6 months after the 
primary vaccination series. Results are shown by SRH.

Supportive data in adult and elderly populations 
In two dose finding studies 80 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N3 or 
H9N2). Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages 
(7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. 
Serum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates. 
Serologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved 
seroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections. The adjuvanted vaccine 
was also found to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated 
in 2003 and 2004, which exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. 
Two doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages 
(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart. Serologic responses 
obtained with the HI assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% 
seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections.

Long term booster immune memory: 
A single vaccination with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine induced high 
and rapid serological response in subjects primed 6to 8 years previously with two doses of a different 
vaccine, having the same formulation but using the H5N3 strain. 
In a phase I clinical trial (V87P3) adult subjects aged 18 to 65 years primed 6 to 8 years previously 
with 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine/A/Duck/Singapore/97, were administered 2 booster 
doses of H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine. SRH results after the first dose, 
that mimic prepandemic priming plus single heterologous booster dose, revealed seroprotection and 
seroconversion rates of 100% (74- 100) and an 18-fold increase in SRH area (GMR). 
Alternative vaccination schedules: 
In a clinical trial evaluating 4 different vaccination schedules in 240 subjects 18 to 60 years of age, 
where the second dose occurred either 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks after the first dose of H5N1 MF59C.1

adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine, all vaccine schedule groups after 3 weeks from the 2nd 
vaccination achieved high levels of antibodies as evaluated with SRH. SRH seroprotection rates 
ranged from 86% to 98%, seroconversion rates from 64% to 90%, and GMR ranged from 2.92 to 4.57. 
The magnitude of immune response was lower in the group who received the second dose 1 week later 
and higher in the groups with longer interval schedules. 
Subjects with underlying medical or immunosuppressive conditions: 
Immunogenicity of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in adults (18 to 60 years) and elderly (>61 years) 
subjects with underlying medical conditions (Study V87_25) or immunosuppressive conditions 
(mainly HIV-infected subjects) (Study V87_26) in comparison to healthy adults (18-60 years) and 
elderly (>61 years), was evaluated in two randomised, phase III controlled clinical trials (with a 
seasonal trivalent inactivated MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine approved for use in elderly 
subjects 65 years of age and older as a comparator). In trial V87_25 and V87_26, 96 and 67 subjects, 
respectively, were over the age of 70 years. In both trials, immunogenicity of 
H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 was shown by HI, SRH and MN assays following both the first and 
second dose.

HI results for the two clinical studies revealed lower values than those reported in previous studies. 
Seroconversion rates against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 ranged from 37.50% to 43.10% in 
healthy adults, and from 19.18% to 26.47% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical 
conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 21.43% to 30.65% in healthy elderly 
subjects, and from 24.49% to 27.86% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroconversion rate of 66.67% in 
healthy adults, and ranging from 33.57% to 54.14% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 24.39% to 29.03% in healthy 
elderly subjects, and from 31.65% to 39.42% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or 
underlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
In both studies V87_25 and V87_26, the lower levels of antibodies (as measured by HI, SRH and MN 
assays) and reduced seroprotection rates in adults and elderly (≥ 61 years old) subjects with underlying 
medical or immunosuppressive conditions, suggest that H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 may not elicit 
the same level of protection against A/H5N1 strain as compared to healthy adults (see section 4.4). 
These studies provided limited immunogenicity data in subjects with some underlying medical (in 
particular, renal impairment and peripheral cardiovascular disease) and immunosuppressive conditions 
(in particular, transplant recipients and patients under cancer treatment). In these trials, lower levels of 
antibodies and reduced seroprotection rates against homologous H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were 
also measured in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to healthy adults, though previous studies 
showed induction of sufficiently immunogenic responses against H5N1 strains (see above for 
information on elderly). 
Paediatric population 
The immunogenicity of aH5N1 in the paediatric population was assessed in Studies V87P6 and 
V87_30. 
V87P6 was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant 
in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses of 7.5 micrograms were administered 
three weeks apart and a third dose 12 months following the first dose. After 3 weeks from the second  
vaccination (day 43) all age groups (i.e. 6 to 35 months, 3 to 8 years and 9 to 17 years) achieved high 
levels of antibodies to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 as evaluated with SRH and HI assays as presented in 
table below.

from 29 (95%CI: 25-35) to 50 (95%CI: 44-58). 
Study V87_30 was a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre study to measure the immunogenicity of 
several formulations of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and MF59 adjuvant. In this study, 420 
paediatric subjects 6 months to 8 years of age were divided into two age cohorts: 6 to 35 months of 
age (N=210) and 3 to 8 years of age (N=210). 
The vaccine was administered in two separate injections given 3 weeks apart. Antibody levels against 
A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were measured by HI and MN assays three weeks after the second 
vaccination (Day 43). The immunological response for the the approved formulation (7.5 micrograms 
HA with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml dose) and the study formulation with half the antigen content 
(3.75 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjvant, 0.5 ml dose), are presented below.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Suspension for injection. 
Milky-white liquid. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. 
Foclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Individuals 6 months of age and older: administer two doses (0.5 ml each), 21 days apart. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited 
(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available in children aged less than 6 months. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the 
thigh in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older individuals. 
4.3  Contraindications 
History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues 
(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate,  neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde,  
hydrocortisone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic 
situation, it may be appropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as 
defined above, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. See 
section 4.4. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity  to the 
active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to thiomersal and to residues (eggs, 
chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate,  neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone 
and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness 
until the fever is resolved. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Immunocompromised individuals, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic 
defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced immune response to active immunisation. 
The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There 
are no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to 
assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless 
the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. 
Protection against influenza 
There is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.  
Some degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to 
that of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of 
other clades is unknown (see section 5.1). 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with 
other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. 
While no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have 
been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine 
similar to Foclivia. 
The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in 
subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from 
epilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience 
convulsion. (see section 4.8). 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Excipients with known effect  
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’ 
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Foclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation 
should be carried out on separate limbs. 
There are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal 
influenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be 
carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Limited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with 
Foclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-
associated risks in pregnancy. 
However, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were 
vaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which 
contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse 
events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria 
exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of 
Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, 
abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations 
among almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated 
controls. 
Health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine 
to pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. 
Breast-feeding 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks 
to the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. 
Fertility 
There are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive 
or developmental toxicity of Foclivia (see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Foclivia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4.8  may temporarly affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of  H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (7.5 or 15 micrograms  
haemagglutinin, HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 
strain has been evaluated in nine clinical trials in healthy subjects involving 5055 adults, elderly and 
children. There were 4041 adult subjects 18 to 60 years of age and 540 elderly subjects 61 years of age 
and above. In the paediatric population, there were 214 subjects 6 to 35 months of age, 167 subjects 3 
to 8 years of age and 93 subjects 9 to 17 years of age. 
The  overall safety profile was similar across the adult, elderly and paediatric populations.  
Clinical trials in 383 subjects receiving MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine with an H1N1, H5N3 or H9N2 
strain showed a similar safety profile to the H5N1 trials. 
Irrespective of antigen dose, antigen subtype or age group, most local and systemic adverse reactions 
after administration were of short duration, with onset close to the time of vaccination, and were mild 
or moderate in severity. Across all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of local 
adverse reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
In adults 18 to 60 years, the most frequently reported (≥10%)  adverse reactions were injection site 
pain (59%), myalgia (34%), headache (26%), injection site redness (24%), fatigue (24%), injection site 
induration (21%), injection site swelling (15%), chills (13%) and maliase (13%). 
In elderly subjects (≥61 years), the most frequently reported (≥10%) adverse reactions were injection

The majority of these reactions usually disappear within 3 days without treatment. 
Clinical trials in special populations 
Adverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and 
V87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or 
with underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Across studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and 
elderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in 
immunocompromised subjects 18 to 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) were 
reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and elderly 
subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. 
The following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported 
with the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 
irrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and 
vomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive 
conditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy 
subjects (irrespective of age).    
Post-marketing surveillance 
No post-marketing experience exists for Foclivia administration. 
In addition to the  adverse events listed from clinical studies, the following adverse events were 
reported from post-marketing surveillance with H1N1v (licensed for use from 6 months of age during 
the 2009 influenza pandemic, and containing the same MF59 adjuvant and manufactured with the 
same process as Foclivia). 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Lymphadenopathy. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis including dyspnoea, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, in rare cases 
leading to shock.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Pandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the 
currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and 
simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data 
obtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be 
used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness 
vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. 
Immune response to H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain. 
Adults (18-60 years) 
A Phase II clinical trial (V87P1) was conducted with  H5N1  MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing  7.5 micrograms 
Haemagglutinin(HA)/dose were administered three weeks apart to 156 subjects. Immunogenicity was

Supportive data in adult and elderly populations 
In two dose finding studies 80 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N3 or 
H9N2). 
Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages 
(7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. 
Serum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates. 
Serologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved 
seroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections. The adjuvanted vaccine 
was also found to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated 
in 2003 and 2004, which exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. 
Two doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages 
(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 micrograms HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart. Serologic responses 
obtained with the HI assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% 
seroconverted after two 7.5 micrograms injections.

Long term booster immune memory: 
A single vaccination with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine induced high 
and rapid serological response in subjects primed 6 to 8 years previously with two doses of a different 
vaccine, having the same formulation but using the H5N3 strain. 
In a phase I clinical trial (V87P3) adult subjects aged 18 to 65 years primed 6 to 8 years previously 
with 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine/A/Duck/Singapore/97, were administered 2 booster 
doses of  H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine. SRH results after the first dose, 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that mimic prepandemic priming plus single heterologous booster dose, revealed seroprotection and 
seroconversion rates of 100% (74- 100) and an 18-fold increase in SRH area (GMR). 
Alternative vaccination schedules: 
In a clinical trial evaluating 4 different vaccination schedules in 240 subjects 18 to 60 years of age, 
where the second dose occurred either 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks after the first dose of H5N1 MF59C.1 
adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine, all vaccine schedule groups after 3 weeks from the second 
vaccination achieved high levels of antibodies as evaluated with SRH. SRH seroprotection rates 
ranged from 86% to 98%, seroconversion rates from 64% to 90%, and GMR ranged from 2.92 to 4.57. 
The magnitude of immune response was lower in the group who received the second dose 1 week later 
and higher in the groups with longer interval schedules. 
Subjects with underlying medical or immunosuppressive conditions: 
Immunogenicity of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in adults (18 to 60 years) and elderly (>61 years) 
subjects with underlying medical conditions (Study V87_25) or immunosuppressive conditions 
(mainly HIV-infected subjects) (Study V87_26) in comparison to healthy adults (18-60 years) and 
elderly (>61 years), was evaluated in two randomised, phase III controlled clinical trials (with a 
seasonal trivalent inactivated MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine approved for use in elderly 
subjects 65 years of age and older as a comparator). In trial V87_25 and V87_26, 96 and 67 subjects, 
respectively, were over the age of 70 years. In both trials, immunogenicity of 
H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 was shown by HI, SRH and MN assays following both the first and 
second dose.

HI results for the two clinical studies revealed lower values than those reported in previous studies. 
Seroconversion rates against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 ranged from 37.50% to 43.10% in 
healthy adults, and from 19.18% to 26.47% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical 
conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 21.43% to 30.65% in healthy elderly 
subjects, and from 24.49% to 27.86% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroconversion rate of 66.67% in 
healthy adults, and ranging from 33.57% to 54.14% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying 
medical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 24.39% to 29.03% in healthy 
elderly subjects, and from 31.65% to 39.42% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or 
underlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies. 
In both studies V87_25 and V87_26, the lower levels of antibodies (as measured by HI, SRH and MN 
assays) and reduced seroprotection rates in adults and elderly (≥ 61 years old) subjects with underlying 
medical or immunosuppressive conditions, suggest that H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 may not elicit 
the same level of protection against A/H5N1 strain as compared to healthy adults (see section 4.4). 
These studies provided limited immunogenicity data in subjects with some underlying medical (in 
particular, renal impairment and peripheral cardiovascular disease) and immunosuppressive conditions 
(in particular, transplant recipients and patients under cancer treatment). In these trials, lower levels of 
antibodies and reduced seroprotection rates against homologous H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were 
also measured in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to healthy adults, though previous studies 
showed induction of sufficiently immunogenic responses against H5N1 strains (see above for 
information on elderly). 
Paediatric populations 
The immunogenicity of aH5N1 in the paediatric population was assessed in Studies V87P6 and 
V87_30. 
V87P6 was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant 
in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses of 7.5 micrograms were administered 
three weeks apart and a third dose 12 months following the first dose. After 3 weeks from the second 
vaccination (day 43) all age groups (i.e. 6 to 35 months, 3 to 8 years and 9 to 17 years) achieved high 
levels of antibodies to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 as evaluated with SRH and HI assays as presented in 
table below.

from 29 (95%CI: 25-35) to 50 (95%CI: 44-58). 
Study V87_30 was a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre study to measure the immunogenicity of 
several formulations of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and MF59 adjuvant. In this study, 420 
paediatric subjects 6 months to 8 years of age were divided into two age cohorts: 6 to 35 months of 
age (N=210) and 3 to 8 years of age (N=210). 
The vaccine was administered in two separate injections given 3 weeks apart. Antibody levels against 
A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were measured by HI and MN assays three weeks after the second 
vaccination (Day 43). The immunological response for the approved formulation (7.5 micrograms HA 
with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml dose) and the study formulation with half the  antigen content (3.75 
micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjvant, 0.5 ml dose), are presented below.

Immunogenicity results with Focetria H1N1v (Study V111_03): 
The seroprotection rate and seroconversion rate measured by HI assay and the seroconversion factor 
expressed as geometric mean ratio of HI for anti-HA antibody to H1N1 after administration of one and 
two 7.5 micrograms doses of Focetria was evaluated in 70 children and adolescents (9 to 
17 years), 60 children (3 to 8 years), 58 children (12 to 35 months) and 49 infants (6 to 11 months). 
CHMP immunogenicity criteria set for adults (18 to 60 years) were met both after the first and 
the second dose in all the above age strata (both in the overall population and in the subset 
seronegative at baseline). 
The European medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Foclivia in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in active immunisation against 
H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Foclivia has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. 
This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this 
medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which 
may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data obtained with Foclivia and with seasonal influenza vaccine containing 
MF59C.1 adjuvant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated 
dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (through 
the end of the lactation period).

6.5  Nature and contents of container 
5.0 ml in 10-dose vial (type I glass) with stopper (halo-butyl rubber). Packs of 10. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Gently shake the multidose vial each time before withdrawing a dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine into a 
syringe. After shaking, the normal appearance of Foclivia is a milky-white suspension. 
Visually inspect the suspension prior to administration. In case of any particles and/or abnormal 
appearance, the vaccine should be discarded. 
Although Foclivia in multidose vials contains a preservative that inhibits microbial growth, 
minimisation of the risk of contamination of the multidose vial during withdrawal of each dose is the 
responsibility of the user. 
Record date and time of the first dose withdrawal on the vial label. 
Between uses, return the multidose vial to the recommended storage conditions between 2° and 8° C. 
The multidose vial should preferably be used within 24 hours after first withdrawal. 
Data are available that suggest that multidose vials could be used up to a maximum of 72 hours after 
first withdrawal, although such pro-longed storage periods should not be the preferred option. 
Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Outside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with 
a specific review of adverse events of special interest (AESI). This should include data from ongoing 
studies, or actual use if applicable, of the pandemic preparedness strains. 
During a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring 
of the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic. Moreover, an annual cycle 
may be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are 
expected within a short period of time. Therefore, annual PSURs falling within the pandemic period 
will be replaced by monthly “simplified PSURs” (S-PSUR) accompanied by a summary of vaccine 
distribution. 
• 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Frequency of submission: 
The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. 
First data-lock point is 30 days later. 
S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45. 
Rapporteur’s assessment report is circulated to CHMP members on Day 50. 
CHMP report is circulated to the vaccine manufacturer on Day 55. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Reporting to be monthly for the first 6 months. 
Periodicity should be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6 monthly intervals. 
When it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering 
the period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to 
be agreed with the Rapporteur. 
• 
Format of the simplified PSUR: 
Only spontaneously reported data should be included in the PSUR. The report should include the 
following Tables of aggregate data . 
1.  An overview for all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of report 
(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by 
the report and cumulatively. 
2.  An overview for all spontaneous adverse reactions by System Organ Class (SOC) and 
Preferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or 
non-medically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period covered by 
the report and cumulatively. 
3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed 
or non-medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows: 
Neuritis 
Convulsions 
PTs “Brachial plexopathy”, “Mononeuritis”, “Neuritis”, “Neuralgic 
amyotrophy”, “Radiculitis brachial”  
narrow SMQ “Generalised convulsive seizures following immunisation”

there will be an overlap in the number of cases for these two categories) 
PTs “Facial paralysis”, “Facial paresis”, “Facial nerve disorder”, 
“Oculofacial paralysis”, “Bell’s palsy” 
HLT Thrombocytopenias 
4.  Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, PTs) stratified according to type of report (medically 
confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report and 
cumulatively. 
5.  All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC and PT, stratified according to type 
of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the 
report and cumulatively.  
6.  All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, PTs) occurring in pregnant women, stratified 
according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period 
covered by the report and cumulatively. 
The following principles should be followed when compiling the data: 
- 
Except for Table 1, all tables will be based on number of reactions (presented on PT level, 
sorted by SOC) and not number of cases. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data1. Product-specific data can be 
evaluated during signal work-up. 
“Cumulatively” means since the use of the vaccine; events not reported during the period of 
interest should not be presented in the tables. 
All non-medically confirmed events are those that have been entered into the database by the 
data-lock point. Those which have not yet been entered should be reported in the following 
S-PSUR. 
A line listing of fatal cases will be provided in an Annex. 
A short summary should be provided in which validated signals and areas of concern are highlighted, 
taking into account information arising from Enhanced Safety Surveillance (ESS). In the event of 
multiple signals, signal work-up may be prioritised and appropriate timelines for submission of a full 
signal evaluation report should be provided. 
Vaccine distribution report 
To put the safety report into context, a summary of vaccine distribution should be included and should 
provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, 
EU member states cumulatively and 
the rest of the world.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Foclivia is and what it is used for 
Foclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. 
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many 
decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of 
ordinary flu but may be more serious. 
It is for use in  to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. 
When a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its 
own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 
As with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Foclivia 
Foclivia should not be given if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of Foclivia, 
are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, 
are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin, 
are allergic to kanamycin sulphate and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), formaldehyde, 
hydrocortisone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). 
- 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling 
of the face or tongue. 
However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as 
medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine: 
- 
if you feel feverish, 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
if you have any illness or infection, 
if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for 
cancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency 
conditions). 
Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
The doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have 
had previous history of epilepsy. 
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse 
if you fainted with a previous injection. 
Foclivia may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with 
weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical 
problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak 
immune system or an underlying long term medical problem. 
In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, 
or may need to be delayed. 
Other medicines and Foclivia 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Foclivia can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no 
information on administration of Foclivia with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Foclivia 
with other vaccines cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such 
cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and 
potential risks of giving you the vaccine.

Some side effects listed in Section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect your ability to drive or use 
tools or machines.  
Foclivia contains sodium and potassium 
Foclivia contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per 
dose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. 
3. 
How Foclivia is given 
Your doctor or nurse administers the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. 
A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, 
depending on the muscle mass. 
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.

How to store Foclivia 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Foclivia is and what it is used for 
Foclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. 
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many 
decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of 
ordinary flu but may be more serious. 
It is for use in to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. 
When a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its 
own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 
As with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Foclivia 
Foclivia should not be given if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of 
Foclivia, 
are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, 
are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin, 
are allergic to kanamycin sulphate and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), formaldehyde, 
hydrocortisone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). 
- 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling 
of the face or tongue. 
However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as 
medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. 
-

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine: 
- 
- 
- 
if you feel feverish, 
if you have any illness or infection, 
if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for 
cancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency 
conditions). 
Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
The doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have 
had previous history of epilepsy. 
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse 
if you fainted with a previous injection. 
Foclivia may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with 
weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical 
problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak 
immune system or an underlying long term medical problem. 
In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, 
or may need to be delayed. 
Other medicines and Foclivia 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.  
Foclivia can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no 
information on administration of Foclivia with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Foclivia 
with other vaccines cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such 
cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and 
potential risks of giving you the vaccine.

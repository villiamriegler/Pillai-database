1.  Introduction 
On 05/06/22, the MAH submitted a final paediatric study report for Humira, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided by the MAH.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study ID P18-835 “Special drug use-results survey of evaluating safety and 
effectiveness of Humira in long term treatment in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa” is 
a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. 
The product is formulated as a subcutaneous injection to adult and paediatric patients according to the 
Humira® label.  
Adalimumab Humira® was prescribed to patients as per Japan label by a physician with sufficient 
knowledge and experience in the treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
• 
P18-835 - Special drug use-results survey of evaluating safety and effectiveness of 
Humira in long term treatment in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa  
Humira® (adalimumab) was approved for the treatment of HS in Japan in February 2019. Study 
P18-835 was conducted based on the GPSP Ordinance (Good Post-marketing Study Practice; 
Ministerial Ordinance No. 171 of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare dated December 20, 
2004). Due to a limited number of Japanese patients (15 patients) in the Phase 3 clinical study of 
Humira® in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (M15-537), the present study was conducted to 
evaluate safety and effectiveness of Humira® in long-term treatment in Japanese patients. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
P18-835 - Special drug use-results survey of evaluating safety and effectiveness of Humira in 
long term treatment in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa  
 
 
Description 
Methods 
This was a prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, non-comparative, non-interventional, multi 
centre Post-Marketing Observational Study (PMOS). 
The PMOS was conducted in accordance with Good Post-marketing Study Practice (GPSP), ministerial 
ordinance of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan. The ordinance requires that 
new drugs be confirmed as safe and effective in daily medical practice. 
No diagnostic or monitoring procedures were performed in this study other than what would be 
considered standard of care.  The treatment period was aligned with the approved Japan label for 
Humira® and only data from evaluations conducted routinely as part of daily practice were collected. 
To minimize selection bias (e.g., prior medications, prior therapies) which is common practice in 
PMOS per Japanese regulation, patients who were newly prescribed Humira® for treatment of HS by 
their physician based on routine clinical practice were included in the study.  Patients who had been 
treated previously with Humira® were excluded.  The observational period of the study was 52 weeks 
from the start of Humira® treatment.  None of the study medication prescribed in this study was 
provided by AbbVie. 
Study participants 
A total of 80 patients were planned and 84 patients were enrolled in this study from 65 registered 
survey sites. One patient was excluded from the safety analysis set due to withdrawal of consent.  A 
total of 83 patients were evaluated for safety and all were included in the effectiveness analysis set. 
Treatments 
Humira® was administered as a subcutaneous injection to adult and pediatric patients according to 
the dosing schedule shown in Table 1.  For adult patients, the first dose of 160 mg was administered 
at Week 0 (Day 1) given in 1 day or split between 2 consecutive days.  The second dose of 80 mg 
was administered at Week 2 (Day 15).  A third dose of 40 mg was administered to 80 patients 
(96.4%) at Week 4 (Day 29) with subsequent doses administered weekly for the remainder of the 
observational period.  Three patients (3.6%) received a third dose of 80 mg at Week 4 (Day 29) with 
subsequent doses administered every 2 weeks for the remainder of the observational period. 
As with the adult patients, pediatric patients were administered a first dose of 160 mg at Week 0 
(Day 1) on the same day or split between 2 consecutive days.  The second dose of 80 mg was 
administered at Week 2 (Day 15) and the third dose of 40 mg was administered beginning at Week 4 
(Day 29) and continued weekly for the remainder of the observational period.

•  Changes from baseline in DLQI at 12 weeks and 52 weeks. 
Sample size 
The sample size is 80 patients. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable since the study is a prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, non-comparative, non-
interventional, multi centre Post-Marketing Observational Study. 
 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics and other basic features of the data. 
Continuous variables were described by the number of valid cases and missing data, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables were described as the total 
number and percentage per category. Descriptive and exploratory statistical methods were used to 
analyse the data of the study. All baseline and disease characteristics were summarized for the 
safety population and effectiveness population. 
Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05. If 
applicable, inferential statistics were performed at a nominal significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). 
Missing observations were documented as missing values. All data was analysed on the basis of 
observed cases. 
No sensitivity analyses have been performed. 
CHMP comments: 
The performed prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, non-comparative, non-interventional, multi 
centre PMOS was performed in Japan in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa as a formal request 
by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Due to a limited number of Japanese patients in the 
Phase 3 clinical study of Humira® at the approval of the indication hidradenitis suppurativa, the 
PMOS was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of Humira® in long-term treatment in 
Japanese patients. 
A total of 80 patients were planned and 84 patients were enrolled in this study from 65 registered 
survey sites. One patient was excluded from the safety analysis set due to withdrawal of consent. A 
total of 83 patients were evaluated for safety, and all were included in the efficacy analysis set. 
Humira® was dosed according to label in both adult and paediatric patients who were exposed to 
Humira® for the first time. Primary endpoints were incidence of serious infections, incidence of 
adverse drug reactions and incidence of infections. Secondary endpoints were related to clinical 
efficacy, change from baseline in CRP, assessment of skin pain and Quality of life. The observational 
period of the study was 52 weeks from the start of Humira® treatment. 
The statistical methods and study design is overall considered adequate for an observational study.

Recruitment 
Study Period 
Enrolment period: From April 23, 2019 to February 14, 2020. 
Study period: From March 11, 2019 to May 14, 2021.  
Baseline data 
Mean age (± SD) of patients in this study was 42.0 ± 15.2 years. Patients < 18 years comprised 4.8% 
(4/83) of the total patients in the study while patients ≥ 18 to < 65 years comprised 85.5% (71/83) 
and patients ≥ 65 years comprised 9.6% (8/83).  No patients were < 15 years old.  The proportion of 
patients who were male was 78.3% (65/83) and the proportion who were female was 21.7% (18/83). 
Means for weight and body mass index (BMI) were 78.55 ± 23.21 kg and 26.90 ± 6.76 kg/m2, 
respectively. 
The mean duration of HS for patients in the study was 12.76 ± 11.14 years.  Areas affected by HS 
lesions were the axilla for 50 patients (60.2%), buttocks for 49 patients (59.0%), the peri-inguinal 
region for 39 patients (47.0%), the perianal region for 23 patients (27.7%), and the perineum for 17 
patients (20.5%).  Of the 66 patients with knowledge of HS family history, 60 (72.3%) reported no 
family history of the disease. Disease severity classified by Hurley classification was I (mild) for 6 
patients (3.6%), II (moderate) for 27 patients (32.5%), and III (severe) for 51 patients (61.4%). 
 
Renal impairment was present at baseline in 7 of 83 patients (8.4%) and hepatic impairment was 
present in an additional 7 (8.4%) patients; no patients had both renal and hepatic impairment. 
Number analysed

Discontinuation of study 
The most common reasons for discontinuation were "hospital transfer or missed visits" and 
"improvement of symptoms." 
Table 3. Discontinuation of study (patients analysed for safety) (from the study report) 
Efficacy results 
The clinical efficacy was evaluated in the study by assessment of overall improvement by the treating 
physician.  A total of 74 of 83 patients (89.2%) were assessed as responders based on this measure. 
The response rate was ≥ 89% at all time points, suggesting that the effectiveness of Humira is 
maintained over the long-term.  The three patients who were treated with 80 mg/week after the third 
dose of 40 mg were assessed as responders at Week 12 and Week 52. 
An evaluation of the response rate by age category showed that 90.7% of patients (68/75) aged ≥ 15 
to  <  65  years  (which  included  the  4  paediatric  patients  aged  ≥  15  and  <  18  years)  and  75.0%  of 
patients (6/8) ≥ 65 years were assessed as responders. 
 
 
The changes from baseline in abscess count and number of inflammatory nodules (AN count) showed 
statistically significant decreases (p<0.0001) at all time points (Weeks 12, 24 and 52, and the final 
assessment).  The proportion of patients who achieved an AN count of 0, 1 or 2 (number, 95% 
confidence interval) was 73.3% (11/15, 44.9 ~ 92.2), 53.3% (8/15, 26.6 ~ 78.7) and 73.3% (11/15, 
44.9 ~ 92.2) at 12, 24 and 52 weeks after the start of treatment, respectively.  The proportion of 
patients who achieved HiSCR was 86.7% (13/15, 59.5 ~ 98.3), 66.7% (10/15, 38.4 ~ 88.2), and 
66.7% (10/15, 38.4 ~ 88.2) at Weeks 12, 24 and 52, respectively.  In summary, the proportion of 
patients who achieved an AN count of 0, 1, or 2 was maintained at approximately 50% after Week 
12.  Similarly, the proportion of patients who achieved HiSCR was ≥ 50% at all time points and 
remained ≥ 60% after Week 24. 
Table 4. Overall improvement rate (from the study report) 
Changes from baseline in CRP, patient global assessment of skin pain, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 30 
response rate, and DLQI score also showed statistically significant decreases at all time points (data 
not shown).  The NRS 30 response rate was ≥ 75% at all time points. 
Safety results 
A total of 39 AEs were reported by 21 patients (25.3%) and 19 ADRs were reported by 10 patients 
(12.0%).  Seven serious AEs were reported in 4 patients (4.8%) and 5 serious ADRs in 2 patients 
(2.4%).  Five patients (13.9%) discontinued from the study due to an AE. 
A total of 11 patients (13.3%) reported AEs of infections and infestations.  ADRs with an incidence of 
≥ 2% by System Organ Class (MedDRA version 24.0) were infections and infestations (6.0%), skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6%), and hepatobiliary disorders (2.4%).  In patients who 
discontinued treatment due to AEs, 13 AEs were reported by 5 patients and 11 ADRs were reported 
by 4 patients. 
The time to onset of AEs was variable and there was no trend toward an increased incidence of 
delayed AEs with long-term use.  No ADRs were observed in the 3 patients treated with 80 mg/2 
weeks after the third dose. 
The outcomes of ADRs were death (1 event in 1 patient), recovering (2 events in 1 patient), and 
recovered (16 events in 8 patients).  One patient with an outcome of fatality was included in the safety 
specification. This patient was a male in his 70s with a complication of "intellectual disability". The 
patient experienced "liver disorder" 65 days after the start of this drug and died 299 days after the 
onset. Humira® was continued after the onset of the event but was discontinued on Day 97 because 
the patient "changed hospital or did not visit the hospital". The physician assessed the event to be 
unrelated to Humira®, but the company considered that the relationship could not be ruled out 
because the event occurred after the administration of this drug, although it was difficult to evaluate 
due to lack of detailed information. An evaluation of key survey items and safety evaluation items found 
that there were no events requiring additional measures. 
 
Safety was also evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; no factor requiring special 
measures was found.  Pregnant women were not included in this PMOS. 
Table 5. Incidence of AEs (from the study report) 
Paediatric Data 
There were 4 children aged 15 years to < 18 years enrolled in this study.  No children were < 15 
years of age.  Among the paediatric patients (< 18 years old), no AEs were reported.  No safety and 
effectiveness analyses were performed with the data collected from these patients.  Paediatric data 
are summarized for each subject in the table below. 
 
 
Table 6. Summary of Paediatric Data (table from the Clinical Overview) 
CHMP comments: 
The mean age of patients included in the study was 42.0 ± 15.2 years. Four individuals were between 
15 and 18 years of age, while the majority (86%) were between 19-65 years of age. Males were in 
majority although females are more commonly affected by HS. Means for weight and BMS were 78.55 
± 23.21 kg and 26.90 ± 6.76 kg/m2, respectively. The mean duration of the disease was 12.76 ± 
11.14 years. Disease severity classified by Hurley classification was I (mild) for 6 patients (3.6%), II 
(moderate) for 27 patients (32.5%), and III (severe) for 51 patients (61.4%). Renal and liver 
impairment were present in 7 of 83 patients, no patient had both renal and hepatic impairment. 
36 patients discontinued the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were "hospital 
transfer or missed visits" and "improvement of symptoms." 
Clinical efficacy was evaluated in the study by assessment of overall improvement by the treating 
physician.  74 of 83 patients (89.2%) were assessed as responders based on this measure.  The 
response rate was ≥ 89% at all time points investigated including at the last observation (week 52), 
suggesting that the clinical efficacy of Humira® is maintained over long-term.  There was no 
 
difference in response rates between the different aged groups included in the study. Changes in the 
other secondary endpoints investigated also showed statistically significant results at all time points 
investigated. 
Primary endpoints were incidence of serious infections, incidence of adverse drug reactions and 
incidence of infections. A total of 11 patients (13.3%) reported AEs of infections and infestations. 
ADRs with an incidence of ≥ 2% by System Organ Class (MedDRA version 24.0) were infections and 
infestations (6.0%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6%), and hepatobiliary disorders 
(2.4%).  One patient with an outcome of fatality was included in the safety specification. This patient 
was a male in his 70s with a complication of "intellectual disability". The patient experienced "liver 
disorder" 65 days after the start of this drug and died 299 days after the onset. Humira® was 
continued after the onset of the event but was discontinued on Day 97 because the patient "changed 
hospital or did not visit the hospital". The physician assessed the event to be unrelated to Humira®, 
but the company considered that the relationship could not be ruled out because the event occurred 
after the administration of Humira®, although it was difficult to evaluate due to lack of detailed 
information. This view is supported by the assessor. 
No factor requiring special measures was found in safety evaluations of patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment.   
There were 4 children aged 15 years to < 18 years enrolled in this study.  No children were < 15 
years of age.  Among the paediatric patients (< 18 years old), no AEs were reported.  No safety and 
efficacy analyses were performed with data collected from these patients which is acceptable 
considering the limited number of patients included.  The overall clinical efficacy and safety profile of 
Humira® in this very limited patient group resemble that of the adult population.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of this observational study support the clinical safety and efficacy of Humira® used in 
treatment of patients, also in the very limited population of four individuals < 18 years of age with HS 
in routine daily practice in Japan.  The study population was examined in an actual clinical setting, 
without any strict selection criteria; thus, the results of this PMOS study are considered to reflect the 
actual situation of patients with HS in Japan.  The response rate based on physician global 
assessment was ≥ 89% at all time points.  Hidradenitis Suppurativa showed improvement also in 
other endpoints.  Response rates were similar across age groups (≥ 15 to < 65 years: 90.7%; ≥ 
65years: 75%).  Similar efficacy was also shown in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Safety and clinical efficacy were also demonstrated in the 4 paediatric patients enrolled in this study. 
No AEs or ADRs were reported in these 4 paediatric patients over the duration of the study. 
The safety results were consistent with the currently documented safety profile of the product, as 
described in the label.  The benefit-risk of adalimumab is unchanged and no update to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics has been proposed because of these data. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
No new findings of clinical efficacy and safety were observed in the performed Post-Marketing 
Observational Study. The MAH has not suggested any update to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics based on the performed study, a view which is supported by the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a progressive rare haematologic disease. It is characterized by excessive 
numbers of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of intact monoclonal 
immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE) or Bence-Jones protein only (free immunoglobulin monoclonal 
κ and λ light chains). Multiple myeloma usually manifests as 1 or more lytic bone lesions, monoclonal 
protein in the blood or urine, and disease in the bone marrow. 
The median survival time is approximately 4 to 5 years (2 years after relapse). Current treatment 
options aim not only to improve survival but also to inhibit tumour progression and delay disease-
related complications. 
Morbidity and mortality were strongly reduced by the application of autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) which provided improvement to melphalan and prednisone (MP) treatments of 
choice for several decades. Since SCT can induce complete remissions and prolong survival, most 
treatment guidelines currently recommend incorporating high-dose chemotherapy (HDT)/SCT into 
initial therapy programs for patients < 65 years old, and to consider HDT/SCT for patients 65 to 70 
years with good performance status and manageable comorbidities.  
The choice of induction therapy prior to HDT/ASCT varies and consolidation and maintenance therapies 
are given following ASCT. The objective of induction treatment is to rapidly de-bulk the tumour without 
causing damage to the haematopoietic progenitor cells in order to achieve the best possible response 
before transplantation. A good induction response is correlated with improved progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes; regimens that maximize clinical response and increase PFS 
and OS are needed. 
Historically, induction therapies have been based upon combinations of corticosteroids, vincristine, 
alkylating agents (such as melphalan or cyclophosphamide) and carmustine. Specific induction therapy 
regimens commonly used in the past included single-agent high-dose dexamethasone, adriamycin-
dexamethasone, vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD), pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-
vincristine-dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide-idarubicin-dexamethasone. The overall response 
rate associated with VAD induction is in the range of 55% to 60%. However, the post-induction 
complete response (CR) rate with traditional induction regimens such as VAD is 5% to 10%. No 
chemotherapeutic agents are currently approved in Europe specifically for induction treatment of MM.  
Velcade (bortezomib) is a reversible proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma 
(MM). It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in 
mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades poly-ubiquitinated 
proteins. The catalytic core of the 26S proteasome is the 20S proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome 
pathway plays an essential role in orchestrating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining 
homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis and 
affects multiple signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. The 
mechanisms by which Velcade elicits its antitumour activity may vary among tumour types, according 
to the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumour growth. Specifically, 
Velcade is thought to be efficacious in MM via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB activation, its 
attenuation of interleukin-6-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and possibly through 
antiangiogenic and other effects.

Velcade is currently authorised in the EU for the following indications: 
Velcade as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple 
myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are 
unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose 
chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant. 
In this application, the MAH of Velcade proposed to extend the indication of Velcade in combination 
with chemotherapy medicinal products for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated multiple myeloma prior to high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. 
This was supported by 3 pivotal studies and one supportive study of Velcade in combination with either 
dexamethasone, adriamycin and dexamethasone or thalidomide and dexamethasone. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) in agreement with Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) to 
support this type II variation. According to this Guideline, drug substances with a log Pow > 4.5 should 
be screened for persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) according to the European 
Chemicals Bureau. 
Phase I: the partition coefficient octanol/water, log Pow, of bortezomib is 2 (pH=7), which is lower 
than the trigger value of 4.5. Consequently, no PBT-assessment is performed. 
The worst case surface water Predicted Environmental Concentration (PECsurfacewater) for 
bortezomib, assuming no degradation or removal in sewage sludge treatment, is 0.32 µg/L. After 
refinement with market penetration data, for which the Applicant calculated that, approximately 
19'500 -20'000 patients will receive bortezomib as treatment for their disease and estimated that the 
consumption for all bortezomib treated patients in EU in the peak year 2016 will be approximately 
1.92 kg/year and 5252 mg/day, the PECsurfacewater was calculated to be 0.0052 x 10-3 µg/L. 
As the PECsurfacewater of bortezomib is in orders of magnitude below the threshold value of 
0.01 µg/L, no further testing in the aquatic environment (phase II) is required. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on the ERA presented, the addition of a new indication for Velcade as induction treatment prior 
to stem cell transplantation for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 7/73 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of bortezomib. Considering the above data, bortezomib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.

The starting dose of Velcade 1,3 mg/m2 was chosen according to the currently approved Velcade dose 
for treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma in combination with other agents 
(that also applies to the monotherapy regimen in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy).  
The numbers and duration of cycles were different in the studies submitted.  
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Study MMY-3003 (HOVON/GMMG) 
Methods 
Study MMY-3003 was an open-label randomised phase 3 study on the effect of bortezomib combined 
with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Dexamethasone for Induction Treatment, Followed by High-Dose 
Melphalan, and Bortezomib Alone During Maintenance in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

Study participants 
Subjects enrolled in this study were required to meet the following acceptance criteria: Patients with a 
confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma stage II or III according to the Salmon & Durie criteria; Age 
18 to 65 years, inclusive; WHO performance status 0 to 3 (WHO=3 was allowed only when caused by 
multiple myeloma and not by comorbid conditions). 
Subjects with the following were excluded from the study: known intolerance of thalidomide or boron,

Treatments 
This study consisted of 3 phases for each study subject: induction treatment phase, high-dose 
chemotherapy with auto SCT phase and maintenance treatment phase. 
Enrolled subjects received up to 3 cycles (28 days/cycle) of induction treatment as vincristine, 
Adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD) or Velcade, Adriamycin and dexamethasone (VcAD). 
Approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the start of the third induction treatment cycle, eligible subjects were 
to undergo stem cell mobilization and collection with a regimen of CAD, and granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF). High-dose melphalan (HDM) was to occur between 6 and 8 weeks after 
stem cell collection. 
Subjects who underwent double transplantation received a second course of HDM between 2 and 3 
months after the first course when the subject achieved at least a partial response (PR). 
Maintenance treatment was to begin 4 weeks after the last course of HDM and continue for up to 2 
years or until disease progression occurred. Maintenance treatment was also to be terminated for 
subjects who did not achieve at least minimal response (MR) at 6 months after starting maintenance 
treatment. After completion of study treatment, subject data were followed-up for the collection of 
survival status and disease progression information. 
Objectives 
The objectives were to assess the efficacy of Velcade combined with intensive chemotherapy and in 
maintenance therapy in comparison with intensive therapy with vincristine followed by thalidomide 
maintenance in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma, as measured by the progression-
free survival (PFS); To evaluate the overall response rate and CR + very good partial response (VGPR) 
both after induction treatment and after autologous transplant (auto-SCT); To evaluate overall survival 
(OS) and to assess the safety and toxicity of Velcade combined with intensive chemotherapy and in 
maintenance therapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS with censoring at the time of allo-SCT (PFSC): 1-year, 2-year, 
and 3-year. 
Subjects with progression before HDM but who obtained at least a PR on HDM were not counted as an 
event. Subjects who received allo-SCT before progression/relapse were censored at the date of 
transplantation. Subjects known to be still alive and free of progression at the last day of contact were 
censored at that time. 
The secondary endpoints were response rate (CR/nCR) post-induction (i.e after induction before HDM) 
and post-transplant (i.e. after HDM/auto-SCT). Response rate after second transplant was also a 
secondary endpoint for subjects who had undergone a second transplant. 
The secondary endpoint OS was defined as the interval between the date of randomisation and the 
date of death from any cause.  
PFS without censoring at allo-SCT and PFS from the time of HDM were also considered at  1-year, 2-
year, and 3-year, as well as time to progression. 
Investigator assessment of response was done according to EBMT, IBMTR, and ABMTR criteria (Bladé 
et al. 1998) after the third VcAD or VAD course, after stem cell collection, and after each course of 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013

HDM. During maintenance treatment, disease status was evaluated every 2 months. According to the 
response criteria, response was required to be confirmed after 6 weeks. However, this requirement 
was not applied to the response measurements after the third VcAD or VAD course, after stem cell 
collection, and between the 2 courses of HDM, as the treatment intervals were too short. 
Complete response (CR) required all of the following: 
•  Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein (M-Protein) in serum and (10 x concentrated) 
urine by immunofixation, maintained for at least 6 weeks 
• 
Less than 5% plasma cells in a representative bone marrow aspirate or otherwise in a bone 
marrow biopsy. Only in subjects with non-secretory myeloma, bone marrow investigations 
were to be repeated after an interval of 6 weeks to confirm CR 
•  No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of compression fractures did 
not exclude CR) 
•  Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytoma 
nCR was not defined in the protocol but derived afterwards. A response of VGPR/PR (as captured on 
the CRF) was re-coded as nCR if it fulfilled all criteria for CR except a negative immunofixation (either 
positive or unknown/not done). 
Very good partial response (VGPR) required meeting the criteria for PR but show a 90% reduction of 
serum M-Protein concentration for at least 6 weeks. 
Partial response (PR) required all of the following: 
•  50% reduction of serum M-Protein concentration maintained for at least 6 weeks 
•  Reduction in 24 hours urine M-Protein either by >=90% or to <200 mg, maintained for at least 
6 weeks 
• 
In subjects with non-secretory myeloma, >=50% reduction in plasma cells in a representative 
bone marrow aspirate, or otherwise bone marrow biopsy, maintained for at least 6 weeks 
•  50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytoma 
•  No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of compression fractures did 
not exclude PR) 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that the PFS at 3 years for subjects in the 
control group was 50%, and PFS in the experimental group was 60%, which corresponds to a relative 
hazard rate of 0.74. The number of events needed to detect a hazard rate of 0.74 with a power of 80% 
and significance level 0.049 (2-sided and adjusted for 1 interim analysis at a significance level of 
0.001) was 356. Assuming that 10% of subjects would receive allogenic transplantation, this number 
of events was expected to be reached with the inclusion of 800 subjects in 3 years and an additional 
follow up of 2 years. A significance level of 0.05 was used for other efficacy endpoints. All tests were 2-
sided. 
Randomisation 
Randomisations were balanced with a biased-coin minimization procedure ensuring balance within each 
stratum and overall balance. Initially, the minimization was based on study centre, Salmon & Durie 
Stage (2 versus 3), and LDH level (≤ULN versus >ULN of LDH). After the third protocol amendment, 
the minimization was based on study centre and ISS stage (I versus II versus III).

Statistical methods 
Three analysis populations were used in this study: the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, evaluable 
analysis set, and safety analysis set. The ITT analysis set, which included all randomised subjects, was 
used for demographic summaries and efficacy analyses. The safety analysis set for the Induction Phase 
included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of induction study treatment. The 
safety analysis set for the Transplant Phase included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 
HDM/auto-SCT. The safety analysis set for the Maintenance Phase included all randomised subjects 
who received at least one dose of maintenance drug. 
The primary treatment comparison was based on a stratified log-rank test. Stratification factor was to 
include ISS (I versus II versus III versus unknown), which was derived using data reported in the case 
report form (CRF). The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined to 
estimate the treatment effect using the stratified Cox regression analysis. For each treatment group, 
1-year, 2-year, and 3-year PFS rate were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and a 95% CI was 
computed. Analyses similar to those described for the primary efficacy endpoint were used for all 
secondary endpoints, except response rate, where comparisons of the response rate between the 2 
treatment groups were made using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. Response rate 
and its associated 95% CI were to be provided for each treatment group. Safety of the treatment 
groups was compared using the incidence and severity of adverse events, and laboratory test results. 
Adverse event severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0.

months (95% CI: 25.2, 31.8) in the VAD treatment group and 35 months (95% CI: 30.7, 38.3) in the 
VcAD treatment group (HR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.95; p=0.012). 
Higher % of censored was observed in VcAD treatment group (41.7% vs 34.4% in the VAD treatment 
group).

PFS from the time of HDM  
By the 12 April 2011 clinical cutoff date, the median PFS was longer in the VcAD treatment group 
compared with the VAD treatment group; 26 months (95% CI: 22.1, 31.7) in the VAD treatment group 
and 31 months (95% CI: 26.7, 33.9) in the VcAD treatment group (HR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.00; 
p=0.052). 
Higher % of censored was observed in VcAD treatment group (45% vs 38% in the VAD treatment 
group). 
Overall survival 
Figure 5 – Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival (Study MMY-3003 ITT analysis set) 
Ancillary analyses 
PFSC and PFS, relative to baseline stratification factors, demographic data (sex and age) and disease 
characteristics (ISS staging and cytogenetic abnormalities), were evaluated as planned.  
The HR for each subgroup analysed was consistently <1, suggesting that the risk for a PFSC or PFS 
event was lower in the VcAD treatment group than in the VAD treatment group in all the subgroups 
examined, in particular, among the subgroups with ISS Stage III, high-risk cytogenetics, renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min), and in male. Therefore, the magnitude of the 
subgroup-specific treatment effects was consistent with the overall analyses of PFSC and PFS. 
When considering the cytogenetic classification VAD treatment seems to be more effective (PFS) on 
high risk patients and with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min).

The results from all other secondary efficacy endpoints and subgroup analyses were also consistently 
in favor of VcAD treatment. There was a trend towards a benefit in OS, but median OS was not 
reached in either of the treatment groups. 
Study IFM 2005-01 (IFM) 
Methods 
Study IFM 2005-01 was an Open-label, multicentre, randomised phase 3 study to compare the 
combination of Velcade and dexamethasone (VcD) with VAD in the treatment of patients up to the age 
of 65 with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
Figure 6 – Study IFM 2005-01 design  
Note:  for  the  scope  of  the  meta  analysis,  arms  were  merged  in  order  to  form  2  homogeneous  arms  in  terms  of 
regimens. 
Study participants 
Subjects enrolled in this study were required to have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma according to 
Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria, have not been previously treated apart from local

radiotherapy in case of a threatening or incapacitating lesion and/or a 4-day block of dexamethasone 
in case of emergency, and have a measurable monoclonal spike (>10 g/L in the serum or 
0.2 g/24 hour in the urine).  
Subjects with the following were excluded from the study: Stage 1 indolent myeloma, ECOG 
performance status >2, history of cancer, confirmed amyloidosis positive HIV serology, peripheral 
neuropathy NCI Grade ≥2, and use of an investigational medicinal product during 30 days prior to 
inclusion. 
Treatments 
Enrolled subjects were randomised to receive either VAD or VcD for up to 4 cycles of induction 
treatment (28-day cycles for VAD or 21-day cycles for VcD) with or without an additional 2 cycles of 
induction intensification treatment, followed by stem cell mobilization, collection, and transplant. 
Eligible subjects underwent 1 to 2 SCTs preceded by HDT with melphalan as conditioning treatment. 
No maintenance treatment was included in this study.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the complete response/near complete response (CR/nCR) rate 
(with negative or positive immunofixation) obtained with the VAD or VcD combination used as 
induction treatment in subjects up to the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction CR+nCR rate. The response criteria were 
adapted from the EBMT criteria (Bladé et al., 1998). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-induction and post-transplant CR/nCR, VGPR, or PR), PFS 
and OS. 
Sample size 
Approximately 480 subjects were to be enrolled to ensure 440 subjects were to be included in the 
analysis. With 440 subjects and a 2- sided α=0.05 (significance level of the statistical test), the study 
would have a power of 80% to detect a difference of 10% in the rate of CR/nCR between induction 
treatment with four cycles (assuming a CR/nCR rate of 20% versus 10%, respectively).  
Randomisation 
The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 4 treatment groups: VAD with no induction 
intensification; VAD followed by induction intensification with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide or etoposide phosphate and cis-platinum (DCEP); VcD with no induction intensification and 
VcD followed by induction intensification with DCEP. 
Randomisation was performed centrally and was stratified on the basis of the initial β2 microglobulin 
level (> or ≤3 mg/L) and the presence of chromosome 13 abnormalities identified by FISH analysis.

Statistical methods 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a significance level of 0.0475 was used, taking into account 1 
interim analysis. A significance level of 0.05 was used for other efficacy endpoints. The primary 
treatment comparison (post-induction CR/nCR rate) was based on a stratified Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test. Response rate and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were to be 
provided for each treatment group. Analyses similar to those described for the primary endpoint were 
used for all secondary endpoints. For each treatment group, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year PFS rates were 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a 95% CI was computed. The primary treatment 
comparison was based on a stratified log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% CI were 
determined to estimate the treatment effect using the stratified Cox regression analysis.  
Three analysis populations were defined as intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, evaluable analysis set, 
and safety analysis set. The ITT analysis set, which included all randomised subjects, was used for 
demographic summaries and efficacy analyses.

There were 5 protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. The median age was 57 years 
in both groups (range: 26 to 65 years), with 60% of subjects ≥55 years of age. The study population 
was 55% men and 45% women. At baseline, median body surface area was similar in both treatment 
groups (1.80 m2 in the VAD group and 1.90 m2 in the VcD group), and the majority (88%) had a World 
Health Organization (WHO) performance status score of ≤1.  
Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Across the VAD and  VcD 
groups, the subtypes of myeloma at baseline included IgG (62% and 60%, respectively), IgA (22% in 
both  groups),  and  light  chain  (13%  and  15%,  respectively).  The  rest  of  the  subtypes  of  multiple 
myeloma  were  reported  in  ≤2%  of  subjects.  Across  the  VAD  and  VcD  groups,  subjects  entered  the 
study with similar ISS Stage disease: Stage I (42% and 43%, respectively); Stage II (35% and 33%, 
respectively), and Stage III (23% and 25%, respectively). The median baseline serum M-protein level 
was 3.64 g/dL and 3.41 g/dL for the VAD and VcD groups, respectively).  
The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VAD group and 11 weeks for the VcD group. 
The median number of cycles received for both groups was 4 cycles.

The values presented in the table below reflect the clinical database with respect to the number of 
subjects who received stem cell mobilization with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), as 
well as the number of subjects who had stem cells collected.  
Table 7 – Stem cell related procedures and transplant (Study IFM 2005-01) 
Ancillary analyses 
Analyses relative to baseline stratification factors, demographic data (sex and age) and disease 
characteristics (ISS staging and cytogenetic abnormalities), Creatinine clearance (ml/min) (<60 versus 
≥60) were performed for post-induction and post-transplant response rate and PFS. 
The point estimate of the odds ratio was >1 for all subgroups for evaluation of post-induction and post-
transplant CR/nCR response rate, which is consistent with the overall observation of treatment effect in 
favor of the VcD group over the VAD group. 
With the exception of ISS Stage I, the point estimate of the hazard ratio for PFS was <1 for all 
subgroups, which is consistent with the overall observation of treatment effect in favor of the VcD 
group over the VAD group. For the cytogenetic classification “high risk”, stage II, renal impairment

according to CR/nCR endpoint, it seemed that VcD treatment performs better than in standard risk 
patients. 
The results for other endpoints (post-induction response overall response rate, post-induction phase 
with induction intensification, post-transplant phase and post-transplant phase with induction 
intensification) were all consistent in favor of VcD treatment.  
Study MMY-3010 (PETHEMA)

Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria for subject enrolment in the study were: age ≤65 years, eligible for autologous 
transplantation, with a life expectancy >3 months; diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma and did 
not receive prior specific treatment for the disease with the exceptions of emergent steroid pulses prior 
to the start of induction treatment or bisphosphonate administration; measurable disease defined by 
the presence of quantifiable monoclonal component in serum, or in urine if light chain excretion was 
≥200 mg/24 hours; ECOG performance status ≤2; laboratory values as specified in the study protocol; 
voluntarily signed an informed consent form; and able to comply with all study requirements.  
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013

Subjects meeting any of the following criteria were excluded from the study: had non-secretory 
multiple myeloma or previously received treatment for multiple myeloma, with the exceptions of 
emergent steroid pulses or bisphosphonate administration; had Grade 2 or higher peripheral 
neuropathy within 14 days of study entry; was scheduled for major surgery within 4 weeks of 
recruitment; had known hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or their components; was 
currently in another clinical study or received an investigational agent within 30 days of study entry; 
experienced a myocardial infarction within 6 months of entry or had any cardiac deficiency as 
described in the protocol; was a carrier of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus 
surface antigen, or had active hepatitis C virus infection; or was pregnant or nursing. 
Treatments 
Enrolled subjects were randomised to receive 1 of 3 induction regimens TD, VcTD or VBMCP-VBAD/Vc 
for up to 6 cycles of induction treatment (4-week cycles=24 weeks), followed by stem cell mobilization, 
collection, and transplant. Eligible subjects underwent 1 SCT preceded by HDT with melphalan as 
conditioning treatment.  
Three months after transplantation, subjects who continued on study were re-randomised to receive 1 
of 3 maintenance treatments Interferon α-2b, Thalidomide or Velcade/thalidomide (VcT), which was 
continued for up to 3 years or until disease progression occurred. Subjects who did not achieve CR 
following auto-SCT and who had an identical HLA donor could withdraw from the study to receive allo-
SCT. These subjects were not permitted to receive maintenance treatment as part of this study. 
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the 3 induction chemotherapy 
regimens. The study was also designed to compare the safety and efficacy of the 3 maintenance 
chemotherapy regimens. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were : post-induction and post-transplant response rates 
(CR+nCR+PR), post-induction and post-transplant CR+nCR rates. The final results for post-induction 
and post-transplant responses were centrally reviewed by the study principal investigator according to 
EBMT criteria (Bladé et al., 1998). Regular response evaluation was performed locally. A complete 
assessment of response was mandatory for all subjects at the end of induction treatment, 3 months 
after transplantation, and every 3 months during the maintenance and follow-up periods if there was 
no evidence of disease progression. However, a response using non-invasive procedures was 
performed on Day 1 of each new induction treatment cycle and also during maintenance treatment 
every month for the first year, every 2 months for 2 years, and every 3 months thereafter. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were PFS (the interval between the date of randomisation and the date 
of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Subjects who were progression-free and 
alive at the time of clinical cut-off were censored at the time of their last adequate disease 
assessment), OS and TTP. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that a 2-sided α = 0.05, 80% power, and a 
15% difference in the response rate between the different groups, with a subject recruitment period of 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 30/73 
 
 
 
 
 
36 months and a scheduled analysis 12 months after the last subject was recruited, would require 390 
subjects.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive induction treatments in 1:1:1 ratio. Three months after 
transplantation, if no disease progression had occurred and the auto-SCT was complete and stable 
without unacceptable toxicity, the subjects were again randomly assigned to receive maintenance 
treatments in 1:1:1 ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
For the primary endpoint, post-induction and post-transplant response rate were summarized 
separately. Comparison of the response rate between the induction treatment groups was made using 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Response rate and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) 
were provided for each treatment group. The CR/nCR rates post-induction and post-transplant were 
analysed similarly to response rate. 
For the secondary endpoint, PFS, the log-rank test was used to compare the induction treatment 
groups and the maintenance treatment groups, respectively. The hazard ratio and its 95% CI for each 
pair of comparisons were estimated using the Cox regression procedure. Subgroup analysis for PFS 
was also provided. To adjust for confounding of maintenance therapy from 2-stage randomisation, 
inverseprobability weighting method was performed as an exploratory analysis to compare PFS of 
different induction therapies followed by the same maintenance therapy. Analyses similar to those 
used for PFS were used to assess the secondary endpoints overall survival and TTP.

There were 3 protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were well-balanced among the Induction Phase the treatment groups. The 
median age was 57 years in both groups (range: 25 to 65 years), with 62% of subjects ≥55 years of 
age. The majority of subjects were White (99%) and male (55%). Most subjects had an ECOG 
performance status of 0 (38%) or 1 (48%). The majority of subjects had myeloma of IgG (61%) or 
IgA (22%) subtype. Pre-induction ISS score was classified as Stage I for 38% of subjects, Stage II for 
41%, and Stage III for 21%. Sixteen percent of subjects had creatinine clearance <60 mL/ml, while 
84% had creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. The mean percent of plasma cells in the bone marrow was 
39.8%. Forty-three percent of subjects had minor bone lesions, 32% had major lesions, and 25% had 
no lesions. The majority of subjects did not have osteopenia (65%) or extramedullary plasmacytomas 
(84%). Fifty percent of subjects were cytogenetically classified as standard risk; 13% were high risk. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of subjects at the start of the Maintenance Phase 
were consistent across treatment groups and similar to those of the Induction Phase treatment groups 
at baseline.

Results are presented in the table below. 
Table 9 – Summary of key efficacy results (Study MMY-3010) 
In Study MMY-3010, 75/130 (58%) subjects in the VcTD induction treatment group and 57/127 (45%) 
subjects in the TD induction treatment group were censored for determination of PFS. The types of 
censoring were similar for the 2 groups. Censoring for study cutoff occurred for 65 (87%) subjects in 
the VcTD induction treatment group and 44 (77%) subjects in the TD induction treatment group. 
Censoring for other reasons occurred for 10 (13%) subjects in the VcTD induction treatment group and 
13 (23%) subjects in the TD induction treatment group. 
Subjects only received a single course of SCT. On ITT population, 99% subjects in the TD treatment 
group and 97% subjects in the VcTD treatment group underwent a single SCT; the majority of SCTs 
were auto-SCT. The protocol allowed that subjects who did not achieve CR following HDT/SCT and who 
had an identical HLA donor could be withdrawn from the study at the investigator's discretion to 
receive allo-SCT. These subjects were ineligible to receive maintenance treatment. Although the study 
case report form did not explicitly identify allo-SCT as a potential reason for study discontinuation, 6 
subjects (2 in the TD induction treatment group; 1 in the VcTD induction treatment group; 3 in the

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Methods 
The integrated analysis performed by the MAH combined all subject-level data from 3 of the 
cooperative group studies (MMY-3003, IFM 2005-01, and MMY-3010), with the exception of the 
VBMCP-VBAD/Vc induction treatment group of Study MMY-3010; for the key efficacy endpoints, 
published results from study MMY-3006 were incorporated using meta-analytical methods.  
Sensitivity analyses to demonstrate robustness of the findings were performed for the following 
subgroups (all tests were 2-sided): Age (<55 versus ≥55); Sex (male versus female); ISS stage (I 
versus II versus III); Cytogenetics classification (high risk, standard risk, not done); Renal function 
category (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min versus >60 mL/min). For each efficacy endpoint, the 
significance level was 0.05. Results of the subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint (CR+nCR) were 
provided in a Forest plot. 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 48/73 
 
 
 
 
 
The 4 studies were comparable in terms of design (randomised, open-label, multicentre) with similar 
patient populations (men and women, up to 65 years of age with previously untreated multiple 
myeloma [Durie-Salmon stage II or III] and ECOG-equivalent performance status of 0 to 2/3). 
However, there was a lower percentage of subjects in Study MMY-3010 with cytogenetic high-risk 
(13% in ITT population, 16% TD and 12% VcTD) compared with those in Studies MMY-3003 (376 of 
833 subjects; 45%) and IFM 2005-01 (226 of 470 subjects; 48%).  
Each study met its primary endpoints with satisfactorily statistical significance levels. Consistent results 
were obtained for subgroup analyses within each study and regarding the induction regimens among 
studies. 
Dexamethasone was included in all arms (Vc-based and non-Vc-based) in all studies. The number of 
cycles and duration of each cycle, were different across studies. The number of planned SCTs was 1 in 
Study MMY-3010, 1 or 2 in Studies MMY-3003 and IFM 2005-01, and 2 in Study MMY-3006. 
With the exception of Study IFM 2005-01, all studies included maintenance/consolidation treatment, 
with 1 group receiving a Vc-based regimen. Studies MMY-3003 and MMY-3006 used Velcade 
maintenance/consolidation treatment exclusively for subjects who received Vc-based induction, while 
Study MMY-3010 re-randomised subjects to different maintenance treatment regardless of their 
induction treatment group. 
Heterogeneity for confirming the external validity of the pooled results (e.g. subjects enrolled in 
studies are representative for the common target population, the extent of differences among studies 
of dosage schedule, treatment duration, sample size), was controlled by calculating the I-square for 
CR+nCR rate, PFS, and OS. An I-square of 0% indicates no heterogeneity observed, while larger 
values suggest increasing heterogeneity. 
While the primary endpoints were different among the 3 studies, post-transplant CR/nCR rate was 
chosen as the primary endpoint for the integrated analysis since it is less susceptible, compared to 
PFS, to confounding effects of therapies administered after the end of the induction therapy 
(consolidation and  maintenance therapies).

Consistent with what was observed in the single studies, the post-induction and post-transplant 
CR+nCR rates were significantly improved with Vc-based induction treatment in all subgroups of 
subjects defined by age, sex, ISS stage, cytogenetics classification, and renal function. 
Stem Cell-Related Procedures and Transplant 
For the integrated data, 1,353 of 1,572 (86%) randomised subjects had stem cells collected; 656 
(84%) subjects in the non-Velcade-based induction group and 697 (89%) subjects in the Velcade-
based induction group.  
Of the subjects with stem cells collected, 624 (95%) subjects in the non-Velcade-based induction 
group and 667 (96%) subjects in the Velcade-based induction group underwent transplantation. 
Similar percentages of subjects in the non-Velcade-based and Velcade-based induction groups 
underwent a single transplant procedure (70% versus 72%, respectively).

Supportive study: Study MMY-3006 (GIMEMA) 
Methods 
This study refers to published data (Cavo et al. 2010) with no subject level data are available. The cut 
off date was 30 June 2010. 
The Primary efficacy endpoint was post induction CR+nCR. Secondary efficacy endpoints were post 
transplant CR+nCR, TTP or time to relapse, PFS, and OS.

Due to the exclusive use of Velcade-based consolidation treatment in subjects who received Velcade-
based induction treatment, it was not possible to separate out the effects between induction and 
consolidation treatment on long-term outcomes; i.e., PFS and OS. 
Results 
The median duration of follow-up from the start of study treatment was 36 months.  
Over the ITT population, 44% in VTD and 32.5% in TD received the first transplant; about 35% in both 
arms underwent the second transplant. 
A high % of discontinuation was observed in the TD arm (8% of the enrolled population) vs the VcTD 
arm (4% of the enrolled population) before completing 3 induction cycles treatment. However, in the 
post-transplant phase for the first transplant, the highest discontinuation % was reported in the VcTD 
arm (10% of the enrolled population) vs the TD arm (6% of the enrolled population). After the second 
transplantation, still a higher % of discontinuation was observed in the VcTD arm (5% vs 3% of the 
enrolled population in the VcTD and TD arms, respectively). 
Overall, out of the ITT population, 27% in VcTD arm and 24% in the TD arm completed the treatment. 
The HR for PFS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.88; p=0.0061). 
The estimated 3-year survival rate was similar in both arms: 84% in the TD treatment group and 86% 
in the VcTD treatment group. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The present application was based on three phase 3 studies, 1 supportive study and a meta-analysis.  
All studies were randomised, open-label, multicentre carried out by cooperative groups with the 
objective to compare the efficacy and safety of Velcade-based regimen vs non-Velcade-based regimen.  
A number of differences in the design of these studies were observed (heterogeneity of treatments 
associated with Velcade or number of cycles across studies, differences in maintenance/consolidation 
treatments, percentage of subjects with high-risk cytogenetics).  
The presented meta-analysis was well-designed. The statistical analyses were correct and supported 
the efficacy for Vc-based induction regimen in transplant-eligible subjects with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma.  
While the primary endpoints were different among the 4 studies, the endpoint CR+nrCR was selected 
in the integrated analysis since it is less susceptible, compared to PFS, to confounding effects of 
therapies administered after the end of the induction therapy (consolidation and  maintenance 
therapies).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The integrated analyses showed statistically and clinicallysignificant differences in CR/nCR rate for the 
Velcade-based induction therapies compared with the non-Velcade-based induction therapies. This 
finding was consistent with the results of all individual studies which all met their primary endpoints 
with consistent results across clinically relevant patient subgroups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 53/73 
 
 
 
 
 
Although overall the efficacy of these different combinations seemed similar, a sound comparison of 
the benefit of Velcade-based combination therapies among the 3 studies was challenging as it was 
confounded by too many variables to allow to draw any firm conclusions.  
No new dose-finding study to support the proposed posology (dose, number of cycles, duration of 
cycles) for Velcade in the new indication as induction for SCT eligible patients was performed. The 
starting dose of Velcade 1,3 mg/m2 was chosen according to the currently approved Velcade dose for 
treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma in combination with other agents 
(that also applies to the monotherapy regimen in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy), 
which was acceptable.  
In studies MMY-3003 (VAD vs VcAD) and MMY-3006 (TD vs VcTD) 3 cycles were foreseen of 28 and 21 
days, respectively; in study IFM-2005-01 (VAD vs VcD) there were 4 cycles of 21 days, and in study 
MMY-3010 (TD vs VcTD) the cycles were 6 of 28 days; this represents a major limitation on the 
comparability of the results since the intensity of the treatment might differently affect the efficacy.  
Based on the evidence of efficacy from the results of these studies, the CHMP considered that the 
posology recommendations for the VcTD combination should be four 28-day cycles, followed by 2 
additional cycles in patients with at least partial responses (see also section on clinical safety). 
Dexamethasone was included in all arms (Vc-based and non-Vc-based) in all studies and therefore the 
combination of dexamethasone should be reflected in section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
The VcAD combination regimen showed similar quality of post-induction and post-transplant response 
but safety concerns were identified (see section on clinical safety). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall efficacy data showed a consistent benefit associated with Vc-based therapy compared to non 
Vc-based therapies in the first line induction treatment of MM in patients eligible for SCT. The primary 
efficacy end-points were met in all these studies.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety database presented in support of the present extension of indication, included safety data 
collected from the three Phase 3 clinical studies (MMY-3003, IFM 2005-01, and MMY-3010). Data from 
single studies were pooled and the MAH compared the safety data from the Velcade-based induction 
regimen (i.e., VcAD, VcD, and VcTD treatment groups) versus non-Velcade-based induction regimen 
(ie, VAD and TD treatment groups).  
Integrated safety analysis set (N=1,555) comprised only Pooled Induction Phase data from Studies 
MMY-3003 (n=821), IFM 2005-01 (n=478), and MMY-3010 (n=256). 
The median number of cycles of induction treatment administered in Studies MMY-3003, IFM 2005-01, 
and MMY-3010 were 3, 4, and 6 cycles, respectively. The median treatment duration was 
11.43 months in non-Vc-based vs 11.00 months Vc-based. 
During the Induction Phase, the median dose intensity of Velcade ranged from 5.10 mg/m2/cycle to 
5.20 mg/m2/cycle across all 3 Phase 3 studies. During the Maintenance Phase, the median dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 54/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intensity of Velcade was 0.48 mg/m2/week for Study MMY-3003 and 1.61 mg/m2/month for Study 
MMY-3010. 
During induction treatment, the median total dose (1,440.0 mg), the median dose intensity (480.0 
mg/cycle), and the median relative dose intensity (100%) of dexamethasone were the same in both 
the non-Velcade-based and Velcade-based groups. 
This safety assessment mainly pertained to the induction phase. 
Adverse events 
Study MMY-3003 (VAD vs VcAD) 
Eight hundred twenty one (99%) subjects were included in the Induction Phase safety analysis set and 
699 (84%) subjects in the Transplant Phase safety analysis set (76% of subjects received HDM/auto-
SCT, and 7% of subjects received allo-SCT). 
During the Induction Phase, while the overall % adverse events and drug-related adverse events were 
balanced among the VcAD and VAD treatment groups, there was a higher frequency of serious adverse 
events (53% and 40%, respectively), drug-related serious adverse events (43% and 28%, 
respectively), Grade >3 adverse events (79% and 72%, respectively), and drug-related Grade ≥ 3 
adverse events (70% and 61%, respectively) in the VcAD treatment group than in the VAD treatment 
group.  
Among AEs reported in at least 10% of subjects, AEs reported more in the VcAD group than in the VAD 
group included peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, neuralgia, infections (Herpes 
Zoster), nausea and thrombocytopenia. However, the overall rate of nervous system disorders was 
high in the VcAD group: 65%. The rate of neuropathy was considered high because subjects were 
previously untreated, fit and young.  
Thrombocytopenia and herpes zoster infection were reported more frequently in the VcAD treatment 
group (50% and 16%, respectively) as compared with the VAD treatment group (39% and 3%, 
respectively). Hyponatremia was reported 7% vs 3% in the VcAD treatment group. 
As regard the herpes zoster infection, it should be noted that, during the planned interim analysis of 
the study it was decided that prophylactic anti-viral therapy was to be administered for the VcAD 
treatment group. 
Study IFM (VAD vs VcD) 
478 subjects were included in the Induction Phase safety analysis set, while 207 subjects were 
included in the Induction Intensification Phase safety analysis set. The safety analysis set for the 
Transplant Phase included 406 subjects. 
During induction therapy, while the overall % of adverse events, drug-related adverse events, serious 
adverse events, drug-related serious adverse events, Grade >3 adverse events, and drug-related 
Grade >3 adverse events were balanced among the VcD and VAD groups, there was a higher incidence 
of events of peripheral neuropathy in the VcD group compared with the VAD group (12% versus 2%, 
respectively).  
Peripheral neuropathy with a toxicity of Grade >3 was reported in <1% of subjects in the VAD group 
and 5% of subjects in the VcD group. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, were reported approximately 3 
times more by subjects receiving VcD treatment (6%, 3%) as compared with subjects receiving VAD

treatment (2%, 1%). Further, there were less pyrexia (23 vs 13%) and nausea (29 vs 21%) in the 
VcD-group. 
Study MMY-3010 (TD vs VcTD) 
Three hundred eighty four (99%) subjects were included in the Induction Phase safety analysis set; 
286 (74%) subjects were included in the Transplant Phase safety analysis set. 
Overall, adverse events were experienced by 81% in the TD treatment group, 85% in the VcTD 
treatment group. Drug-related Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were experienced by 13% of subjects in 
the TD treatment group, 24% of subjects in the VcTD treatment group. 
The system organ class with the highest incidence of adverse events for the TD and VcTD treatment 
groups was Nervous System Disorders (TD: 38%; VcTD: 60%); among this, peripheral neuropathy and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (TD: 7%; VcTD: 16%) were occurring more frequently in the VcTD 
treatment group compared with the TD group (4%; VcTD: 34%). The incidences of Grade > 3 
peripheral neuropathy events were 0% in the TD treatment group and 5% in the VcTD treatment 
group. The highest % of peripheral neuropathy was considered drug-related to both Velcade and 
Thalidomide. 
Meta-analysis 
Across studies, there was some variability in several categories of AE incidence, particularly serious 
AEs related to study drug, Grade 3 or higher AEs, and Grade 3 or higher AEs related to study drug. The 
rates for these categories tended to be higher in Study MMY-3003, despite fewer cycles of induction 
treatment administered in that study. This is most likely attributed to differences in AEs collection 
practices across studies. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs during the Induction Phase were somewhat higher for 
subjects in the Velcade-based induction group.  
The AEs were considered drug-related for 84% and 88% of subjects in each respective treatment 
group. Serious treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 37% of subjects in the non-Velcade-based 
induction group and 41% of subjects in the Velcade-based treatment group; drug-related serious AEs 
were reported by 22% and 29% of subjects respectively. 
Fifty-nine percent and 63% of subjects in the non-Velcade-based and Velcade-based treatment-
groups, respectively, experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent AE with a toxicity Grade of 3 or 
higher; drug-related Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 45% and 51% of 
subjects, respectively. 
As compared with the non-Velcade-based group, subjects who received Velcade as an induction 
regimen had similar incidences in adverse drug reactions except for: 
-Thrombocytopenia (non-Vc-based: 22%; Vc-based: 31%) mainly seen in Study IFM (VAD vs VcD) 
-Peripheral neuropathy (non-Vc-based: 7%; Vc-based: 19%) mainly seen in Study MMY-3010 (TD vs 
VcTD) 
-Peripheral sensory neuropathy (non-Vc-based: 7%; Vc-based: 13%) mainly seen in Study MMY-3010 
(TD vs VcTD) 
-Herpes zoster (non-Vc-based: 2%; Vc-based: 11%) mainly seen in Study MMY-3003 (VAD vs VcAD). 
The treatment-emergent drug-related serious AEs with a toxicity Grade of 3 or higher of peripheral 
sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, neuralgia, and polyneuropathy were reported only by 
subjects in the Velcade-based group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 56/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When comparing the TEAEs per treatment phase, it is noted that the % of grade > 3 TEAEs was higher 
during the transplant stage than during the induction phase although balanced between Vc-based and 
non-Vc-based arms; if no safety issue was associated transplant procedure (subjects not 
discontinued), the increase of serious AEs could be related to a treatment additive effect.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
MMY-3003: Among the most frequently reported treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
pulmonary embolism (VAD: 2%; and VcAD: 4%) and vomiting (VAD: 1%; and VcAD: 4%) had a 
higher incidence in the VcAD arm. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events of peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and neuralgia were reported only by subjects receiving VcAD 
induction treatment (5%, 2%, and 3%), respectively. The overall SAE rate was high compared to 
studies with previously treated MM patients.  
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent serious AEs are presented in the table below.

groups. Drug-related serious AEs were experienced by 10% in the TD treatment group, 10% in the 
VcTD treatment group, and 5% in the VBMCP-VBAD/Vc treatment group. No individual drug-related 
serious AE was experienced by more than 2% of subjects in any treatment group.

Deaths 
MMY-3003: 7% of subjects in both the VcAD and VAD treatment groups died during treatment. No 
difference in the causes or timing of death were seen between the treatment groups. 
IFM: 3% of subjects in the VAD group and 1% of subjects in the VcD died during treatment. The 
causes of death are comparable between the two treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013

MMY-3010: 5% of patients in the TD treatment group and 3% in the VcTD treatment group died 
during treatment. Most deaths during the Induction Phase (11 subjects) were due to adverse events. 
The addition of Velcade to induction or maintenance treatment did not increase the overall incidence of 
death during treatment (5% non-Vc-based vs 4% Vc-based regimens). 
Adverse event of interest: peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequently reported TEAE and the most frequent cause of 
discontinuation in patients treated with Vc-based therapies among the three studies.  
The table below presents the incidence of peripheral neuropathy for the full duration of the induction 
phase for each study (VcD=4 x 21 day cycle; VcAD=3 x 28 day cycle; VcTD=6 x 28 day cycle).

The MAH also compared the incidence of peripheral neuropathy observed in studies MMY-3010 and 
MMY-3006 both using VcTD vs TD with the incidence observed in the VISTA study (Study MMY-3002) 
in which Velcade was associated to Melphalan Prednisone. In addition, a comparison with the APEX 
study (Study M34101-039) in which Velcade was given in monotherapy is presented in the table below.

Laboratory findings 
MMY-3003: few (3% or less) Grade 3 abnormalities in the VAD and VcAD treatment groups and 1% 
or less Grade 4 abnormalities. Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 in haematology analytes were 
reported more in the VAD treatment group compared to VcAD treatment group (30% vs. 14%). 
Thrombocytopenia was reported more frequently in the VcAD treatment group as compared with the 
VAD treatment group (50% vs 39%). No new safety concerns were observed in this study. 
IFM: Subjects receiving VcD treatment had more abnormalities in haemoglobin measurements and 
platelet counts compared with subjects receiving VAD treatment. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
were reported approximately 3 times more by subjects receiving VcD treatment (6%, 3%) as 
compared with subjects receiving VAD treatment (2%, 1%). Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 
for hemoglobin abnormalities were reported in 4% of subjects in the VAD group and 17% of subjects in 
the VcD group; however, this is acceptable. The low hemoglobin level is not usually a reason for dose 
adjustment. No new safety concerns were observed in this study.  
MMY-3010: More subjects receiving VcTD had abnormalities in haemoglobin measurements and 
platelet counts compared with baseline. Shifts from Grade 0 or 1 to Grade 3 or 4 in haematology 
analytes were reported at a low frequency in all Induction Phase treatment groups. No new safety 
concerns were observed in this study. 
Safety in special populations 
No dedicated study was performed in special population.  
In the meta-analysis, an evaluation of stratification factors revealed increased incidences (ie, 
differences >10%) in the Velcade-based induction group as compared to the non-Velcade-based 
induction group. These Velcade-related events are consistent with the known safety profile of Velcade 
of the following AES: 
-Peripheral neuropathy (age: >55 years; sex: men; stage of disease: ISS Stages I and II; 
cytogenetic classification: standard and high risk; renal function: <60 mL/min),  
-herpes zoster (stage of disease: ISS Stage III; cytogenetic classification: high risk), 
-constipation (stage of disease: Stage III; renal function: <60 mL/min). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study MMY-3003, 16% (4% due to AEs) in VAD group and 14% (7% due to AEs) in VcAD 
discontinued after induction.  
Only 229 patients from the VcAD group continued to the maintenance therapy after auto-SCT 
compared to 271 patients from the VAD group. Fewer subjects from the VcAD induction treatment 
group entered the maintenance phase, primarily due to persisting toxicity (mainly peripheral 
neuropathy) and ineligibility for further treatment. More subjects in VcAD induction treatment group 
experienced peripheral neuropathy during induction treatment (all peripheral neuropathy events: 41%, 
Grade ≥3: 7%) compared with the VAD induction treatment group (all peripheral neuropathy events: 
27%, Grade ≥3: 1%) However, the reverse scenario was observed during the maintenance treatment 
phase. More subjects developed peripheral neuropathy during thalidomide maintenance treatment 
compared with Velcade maintenance treatment (all peripheral neuropathy events: 52%, Grade ≥3: 7% 
for thalidomide maintenance; all peripheral neuropathy events: 34%, Grade ≥3: 4% for Velcade 
maintenance)

Eighty-five (31%) of 271 subjects from the VAD induction treatment group discontinued thalidomide 
maintenance treatment due to adverse events (mainly peripheral neuropathy) compared with 26 
(11%) of 229 subjects from the VcAD induction treatment group.  
In Study IFM 2005-01, 5% and 8% of subjects experienced a treatment-emergent AEs leading to the 
discontinuation of VAD or VcD treatment, respectively; drug-related treatment-emergent AEs leading 
to the discontinuation of VAD or VcD treatment occurred in 3% and 5% of subjects, respectively. Most 
of the treatment-emergent AEs leading to the discontinuation of induction treatment occurred in the 
Nervous System Disorder SOC (3% in VcD vs 1% in VAD). 
In Study MMY-3010, 6% of subjects in the TD and VcTD treatment groups experienced a treatment-
emergent AEs leading to the discontinuation of induction treatment. Most of the treatment-emergent 
AEs leading to the discontinuation of induction treatment occurred in the Nervous System Disorder 
SOC (TD: 2%; VcTD: 5%). 
Considering the subject disposition in the pooled analysis, in the post induction phase the % of 
discontinuation appears slightly lower in the Vc-based treatment (15% vs 20%). The picture is 
different when considering discontinuation in the post transplant phase; in this case, an higher % of 
events leading to discontinuation was observed in the Vc-based treatment (30% vs 20%) mostly due 
to AEs (12% Vc-based vs 3% non-Vc-based).  
Dose Modifications 
MMY-3003 (VAD vs VcAD): the dose of Velcade was reduced for 16% of subjects in the VcAD 
treatment group; in 4% of subjects the dose of Velcade was reduced due to neurotoxicity. 
IFM (VAD vs VcD): the dose of Velcade was reduced for 13% of subjects receiving VcD treatment 
group: the most frequently cited reasons for reductions in the dose of Velcade were AEs (6%). 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to any dose modification were reported by 9% (VcD) and 2% (VAD) 
of subjects, with 8% (VcD) and 2% (VAD) of these AEs being drug-related. Peripheral neuropathy was 
the most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE leading to a dose modification. 
MMY-3010 (TD vs VcTD): the dose of Velcade was reduced for 31% of subjects in the VcTD 
treatment group. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to any dose modification were reported by 35% 
(VcTD), 7% (TD); most of these AEs were drug-related (34%, 6%) respectively. Peripheral neuropathy 
was the most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs leading to a dose reduction (TD: 5%; 
VcTD: 27%). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Although no unexpected adverse drug reactions were reported in patients treated with Velcade, when 
considering the pooled analysis across the three studies, the events for which the incidence is most 
different between subjects who received Vc-based treatment and non-Vc-treatment were 
thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and Herpes zoster.  
Among the 3 studies, Study MMY-3003 (VAD vs VcAD) was the one with the highest % of serious 
TEAEs: This % was higher in the VcAD mostly due to higher rate of nervous system disorders 
(peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and neuralgia) and infections (herpes zoster, 
pneumonia) compared to the VAD arm. Particularly, this combination regimen showed a numerically 
higher rate of Grade ≥2 (21%) and Grade ≥3 (7%) peripheral neuropathy compared with double-

agent VcD regimen (10% and 5%). The high incidence of herpes zoster infection in VcAD arm was 
reported although the administration of a prophylactic anti-viral therapy. Of note, this was the study in 
which the less number of Velcade treatment cycles was used (3 cycles; 4 cycles in study IFM and 6 
cycles in study MMY-3010). This study also reported the highest % of discontinuation after induction 
(16% VAD vs 14% VcAD); although the % was almost similar, in the VcAD arm a higher % (7%) of 
subjects discontinuation was due to AEs (vs 4% VAD). Velcade dose reduction was needed in 16% of 
patients mostly due to neurotoxicity. Further to these concerns, this combination VcAD was not 
considered approvable. 
In study IFM (VAD vs VcD), the % of serious TEAEs was slightly lower in the VcD (28% vs VAD 34%); 
it should be noted that in this study Velcade was combined only to dexamethasone instead of two 
chemotherapics. Thrombocytopenia was reported approximately 3 times more by subjects receiving 
VcD treatment (3%) as compared with subjects receiving VAD treatment (1%). However, in this study 
8% in VcD arm vs 5% in VAD arm discontinued during the induction phase mostly due to Nervous 
System Disorders. Velcade dose reduction was needed in 13% of patients mostly due to neurotoxicity. 
Among the three studies, Study MMY-3010 (TD vs VcTD) was the one with the highest % of Velcade 
dose reduction (31%); however, that did not affect the discontinuation that happened in 6% of 
subjects in both arms. Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequent cause of discontinuation as well as 
the most frequently reported TEAEs (TD: 7%; VcTD: 16%) with the highest % among the three 
studies.  
The neurotoxicity of bortezomib is a known adverse drug reaction of this drug in the treatment of 
patients with MM. Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequently reported TEAE and the most frequent 
cause of discontinuation in patients treated with Vc-based therapies among the three studies. It is 
acknowledged that a similar and consistent incidence of all grade and >3 grade peripheral neuropathy 
across the three studies was shown. However, this comparison among trials using different combined 
regimens and different treatment cycles has intrinsic limitations that reduce the strength of the 
evidence. 
The incidence of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy for the double-agent VcD induction regimen, as 
investigated in Study IFM 2005-01 (10%) was numerically lower than the corresponding rates of Grade 
≥2 peripheral neuropathy reported for the triple-agent VcAD and VcTD treatment groups from Studies 
MMY-3003 and MMY-3010 (21% and 31%, respectively). The rate of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy 
for the VcD regimen (10%) was also numerically lower than that observed for Grade ≥2 peripheral 
neuropathy for the VcTD regimen in Study MMY-3006 (16%), although the difference was less 
pronounced. The VcD regimen from Study IFM 2005-01 and VcTD regimen from Study MMY-3010 
shared an identical rate of Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy (5%), which was similar to the rate 
observed for the VcAD regimen from Study MMY-3003 (7%) and numerically lower than was reported 
for the VcTD regimen from Study MMY-3006 (10%). 
The rates of peripheral neuropathy events observed for the VcTD treatment group were similar in 
studies MMY-3006 and MMY-3010 despite the difference in number of induction cycles in the studies (3 
cycles MMY-3006 vs 6 cycles in MMY-3010).  
Comparison of results (both efficacy and safety) from different studies sharing common arms, should 
be considered with caution even if the population enrolled apparently look homogeneous. However, 
data on grade 2 neurotoxicity from different studies with Vc are considered useful as a possible 
reference of neurotoxicity incidence generally observed with Vc administered either alone or in 
combination. From the submitted data, Vc single agent-induced grade >2 neurotoxicity ranged from 
24% (SC) to 41% (IV) in second line, whereas the combination of Vc with melphalan and prednisone 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013  
Page 64/73 
 
 
 
 
 
(VcMP) was associated with 32% grade >2 neurotoxicity in the front line setting of the VISTA study 
(MMY-3002). These incidences were considered acceptable and balanced versus efficacy outcomes 
when the SC route was registered (X/47) and when the front line setting was approved (II/28).  
Also in the studies submitted in this application, grade >2 neurotoxicity is highly variable being 10% 
(VcD), 21% (VcAD) and 31% (VcTD): even in the same treatment arm VcTD the incidence is highly 
variable (16% in supportive study MMY-3006 and 31% in MMY-3010). 
The incidence of discontinuation for peripheral neuropathy and grade >3 neurotoxicity is overall similar 
among the studies; discontinuation was slightly higher in study MMY-3010 VcTD (5%) and grade >3 
neurotoxicity was slightly higher in the supportive study MMY-3006 (10%) in which the incidence of 
grade > 2 neurotoxicity was lower. The lower incidence of Grade >3 neurotoxicity demonstrates that 
Grade >2 neurotoxicity was well manageable. 
Therefore, a warning has been included on the need for early and regular monitoring for symptoms of 
treatment emergent neuropathy with neurological evaluation in patients receiving Velcade in 
combination with medicinal products known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and 
that appropriate dose reduction or treatment discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.4 of 
the SmPC). Furthermore, the posology recommendations for the VcTD combination should be of four 
28-day cycles, followed by 2 additional cycles in patients with at least partial responses (see section 
4.2 of the SmPC).  
There was one ascertained case of “colon cancer” toxicity grade 3 reported in the VcTD arm of study 
MMY-3010; no other cases were found following a cumulative search in the Velcade Global Safety 
Database through 8 May 2013. In view of its combination with thalidomide and the concerns on the 
second primary malignancies (SPM, identified risk of thalidomide), the risk management plan of 
Velcade has been updated to include SPM as Missing Information and to use a follow-up questionnaire 
to collect information on any newly reported case of SPM as part of routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
In addition, in view of the teratogenicity of thalidomide, the product information of Velcade has been 
updated to refer prescribers and patients to the thalidomide product information in order to ensure 
that patients receiving Velcade in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy 
prevention programme of Thalidomide Celgene. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The VcAD combination regimen raised concerns with regards to peripheral neuropathy and herpes 
zoster infection. Furthermore, although no notable cardiac signals were observed in study MMY-3003, 
in view of the known cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, the use of such combination as first line induction 
therapy may limit or prevent the possibility to use in second line therapy other agents with a known 
cardiotoxicity potential (e.g. Caelyx-doxorubicin pegylated liposomal, endoxan). Therefore, despite its 
efficacy results, this combination was not considered approvable. 
The safety profile of Velcade in combination with dexamethasone or with dexamethasone and 
thalidomide was considered acceptable. The neurotoxicity of bortezomib is a known adverse drug 
reaction of Velcade in the treatment of patients with MM. Peripheral neuropathy was the most 
frequently reported TEAE and the most frequent cause of discontinuation in patients treated with Vc-
based therapies among the three studies. However, this can be managed through posology 
recommendations as proposed in the SmPC.

Velcade is very commonly associated with 
peripheral neuropathy, which is predominantly 
sensory. However, cases of severe motor 
neuropathy with or without sensory peripheral 
neuropathy have been reported. The SmPC 
provides a recommendation that patients be 
carefully monitored for symptoms of 
neuropathy and those patients experiencing 
new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may 
require the dose and schedule of Velcade to be 
modified. Recommendations for dose 
modification in patients with neuropathy are 
provided in the SmPC, Section 4.2, Posology 
and Method of Administration.  
SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 Undesirable

LVEF has been reported during bortezomib 
treatment. In a single agent Phase 3 
randomised, comparative trial the incidence 
of heart failure in the Velcade (injected

Velcade in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated for 
the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible 
for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
As a consequence of this new indication, section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Particularly, a new warning with regard to reference to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements 
of thalidomide and a warning for early and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment emergent 
neuropathy with neurological evaluation have been added to the product information. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed for this 
extension of indication on the basis of a bridging report making reference to the current product 
information of Velcade. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Results from the three submitted pivotal studies showed a clear statistically and clinically significant 
difference in favour of Vc-based combinations in terms of complete response both in post-induction 
and post-transplant setting. The importance of obtaining a CR during high-dose therapy and stem cell 
transplantation and the association between CR and log-term outcome has been described in a number 
of studies and meta-analyses. 
Median overall survival was not reached in any of the individual studies submitted; however, a trend 
favoring Velcade-based treatment was observed in each study included into the integrated analysis. 
Stem cell collection was well feasible after induction treatment with Velcade-based regimen. This is of 
importance, as this is not the case with all currently used induction treatments. 
The meta-analysis did not allow to draw any conclusion on which was the best combination treatment 
among the different regimens. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Not applicable. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The neurotoxicity of bortezomib is a known adverse drug reaction of this drug in the treatment of 
patients with MM. Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequently reported TEAE and the most frequent 
cause of discontinuation in patients treated with Vc-based therapies among the three studies.  
Serious TEAEs were reported the most frequently in the VcAD combination, particularly with respect to 
nervous system disorders (peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and neuralgia) and 
infections (herpes zoster, pneumonia), although treatment with Velcade was only received for 3 cycles 
in this study. The high incidence of herpes zoster infection in VcAD arm was reported although the 
Assessment report  
EMA/490709/2013

administration of a prophylactic anti-viral therapy. This study also reported the highest % of 
discontinuation after induction although balanced among arms and in the VcAD arm a higher % of 
subjects discontinued due to AEs. Velcade dose reduction was needed in 16% of patients mostly due to 
neurotoxicity. 
Velcade neurotoxicity seems to be enhanced in the combination with Thalidomide, a known neurotoxic 
agent. The incidence of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy for triple-regimen VcTD treatment was 31% 
vs 2% in TD arm. Thalidomide neurotoxicity is not always reversible thus it is preferably to reduce the 
dose of the agent that induce a less manageable toxicity. Indeed, in the VcTD arm the % of patients 
with 1 or 2 Thalidomide dose reductions (44% vs 32% TD) was higher than the % of patients with 1 or 
2 Velcade dose reductions (31%).  
Furhermore, changes in the Velcade product information have been proposed to warn on the risk of 
teratogenicity due to the combination with thalidomide. 
Although study MMY-3006 is considered supportive, it indicates that 4 induction cycles are sufficient to 
achieve a good response. In study MMY-3010 the greatest toxicity was observed in cycles 5 and 6 
while no major difference in efficacy was seen when comparing 6 cycles with 4 cycles. Four treatment 
28-day cycles are therefore recommended and can be extended to 6 in patients with at least PR (see 
SmPC section 4.2).  
In view of the teratogenicity of thalidomide, the product information of Velcade has been updated to 
refer prescribers and patients to the thalidomide product information in order to ensure that patients 
receiving Velcade in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention 
programme of thalidomide. 
Furthermore, the risk management plan of Velcade has been updated to include routine 
pharmacovigilance activities to monitor the risk of SPM as missing Information in view of its 
combination with thalidomide. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Although comparison of results from different studies should be considered with caution, data on grade 
2 neurotoxicity from different studies with Vc were considered useful as a possible reference of 
neurotoxicity incidence generally observed with Vc administered either alone or in combination. In the 
studies submitted in the present application, grade >2 neurotoxicity was highly variable being 10% 
(VcD), 21% (VcAD) and 31% (VcTD); of note the incidence of grade >2 neurotoxicity reported with the 
VcTD treatment arm were highly variable across studies (16% in supportive study MMY-3006 and 31% 
in MMY-3010). Consequently, a warning has been included on the need for early and regular 
monitoring for symptoms of treatment emergent neuropathy with neurological evaluation in patients 
receiving Velcade in combination with medicinal products known to be associated with neuropathy 
(e.g. thalidomide) and that appropriate dose reduction or treatment discontinuation should be 
considered (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Based on the evidence of a low risk of SPM (1 ascertained case of “colon cancer” toxicity grade 3 was 
found in VcTD arm of study MMY-3010; no other cases were found following a cumulative search in the 
Velcade Global Safety Database through 8 May 2013), the risk management plan of Velcade has been 
updated to include routine pharmacovigilance activities to monitor the risk of SPM as missing 
Information.

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The availability of new medicinal products in the first line treatment of MM in patients suitable for HDT 
with auto-SCT is considered of great clinical value. The benefit of Vc-based treatments in the proposed 
indication was considered sufficiently proven for CR/nCR. Both the post-induction response rates as 
well as the post-transplant response rates in patients treated with Vc-based combination therapies are 
higher compared to non Vc-based regimens.  
The  neurotoxicity  of  bortezomib  is  a  known  adverse  drug  reaction  of  this  drug  in  the  treatment  of 
patients with MM. Peripheral neuropathy was the most frequently reported TEAE and the most frequent 
cause of discontinuation in patients treated with Vc-based therapies among the three studies. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Clear evidence of efficacy of Vc-based combinations in the sought indication was provided by the 
submitted trials.  
However, in view of the higher incidence of haematological toxicity, including thrombocytopenia, and 
consequent herpes zoster infections, as well as neurotoxicity ofthe combination of Velcade with 
doxorubicin and dexamethasone was not considered approvable. 
A higher neurotoxicity incidence was associated to the greater thalidomide exposure (study MMY-3010) 
in terms of daily dose and treatment duration. However, this can be managed through monitoring and 
posology recommendations including dose reductions. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The efficacy in terms of response rate of the combination of Velcade with dexamethasone and 
doxorubicin did not outweigh its risks. 
Based on the reviewed, efficacy and safety data, the benefit-risk balance of the combination of Velcade 
with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide for the induction treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation was considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes: 
Variation accepted

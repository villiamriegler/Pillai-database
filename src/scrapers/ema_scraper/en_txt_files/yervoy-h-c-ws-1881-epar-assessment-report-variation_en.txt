2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem  statement 
Disease or condition 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, locally invasive, and highly aggressive cancer of the 
pleura membrane. Patients with MPM usually have a very poor prognosis, and less than 10% of patients 
live beyond 5 years.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 9/164 
 
 
 
 
 
State the claimed therapeutic  indication 
At the time of submission, the MAH has proposed the following indication: 
For OPDIVO: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab  is indicated for the first line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
For Yervoy: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Proposed dosage and administration 
The recommended dose is nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) administered as a 30-minute 
intravenous (IV) infusion with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) administered as a 30 minute IV 
infusion until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years in patients without disease 
progression. 
Epidemiology  and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and incurable disease. MPM affects approximately 31,000 
people around the world, with around 30,000 new cases diagnosed annually.  The annual incidence of 
MPM in the United States (US) is estimated to be 1 in every 100,000 with approximately 3,000 new cases 
per year.  Total incidence is highest in the US and United Kingdom (UK) although per capita, Australia and 
Italy also rank highly. The global incidence of MPM has risen steadily over the past decade and is predicted 
to continue to an estimated peak in 2020.In Europe, about 1.6 per 100,000 inhabitants corresponding to 
8,000 new diagnoses annually. Based on a 5-year survival of 5%, the complete prevalence is 1.9 per 
100,000 corresponding to 10,000 prevalent cases [Gatta, 2001]; thereby fulfilling the criteria for an 
orphan disease. There is a large intercountry variation: the incidence is 1.25/100,000 for example in 
Great Britain and 1.1/100,000 in Germany. MPM occurs predominantly in men (ratio of men to women 
5:1) [Larsson, 2007]. The median age of diagnosis is 68 years. 
Occupational exposure to asbestos is the most important risk factor associated with MPM. The lifetime risk 
of developing MPM among asbestos workers is thought to be as high as 10%. The mean latency period of  
MPM after exposure to asbestosis is around 40 year (range 15-67 years). The ongoing, unregulated use 
of asbestos in industrial countries such as India, Brazil, China, and Russia means that MPM will continue 
to represent a significant global health concern even after peak incidence has passed.  Non occupational 
exposure to asbestos (e.g., in areas with asbestos rich soil or inhalation of other fibrous silicates) can also 
contribute to an increased risk for MPM. Other potential factors are radiation, and erionite. 
Clinical  presentation,  diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
MPM is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage due to late and non-specific symptoms. Thoracoscopy, or 
transparietal biopsies when thoracoscopy is contra-indicated, are the best methods for obtaining the 
diagnosis of MPM. These procedures provide large pathological specimens which are required for the 
reliable diagnosis of MPM via immunohistochemical examination. Several tumour markers  have been 
studied, for early detection or diagnosis of MPM, but none appear  to be reliable.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 10/164 
 
 
 
 
Three major histologic subtypes of MPM are well described: epithelioid (most common), sarcomatoid, and 
mixed-type (biphasic), with the poorest prognosis in non-epithelioid subtypes.  Gender is also a known 
prognostic factor in MPM, with females typically having longer survival time than males. 
The optimal approach to MPM measurement requires the expertise of radiologists to identify 
measurement sites on computerized tomography (CT) scans as per modified Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumours (mRECIST).  Despite these criteria, evaluation of MPM based on imaging data is 
challenging given the lack of clearly demarcated margins of the lesions and progression-free survival 
(PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are not reliable endpoints.  
Thoracoscopy is recommended to obtain adequate histology, optimal stage and to allow pleural fluid 
evacuation. During thoracoscopy, multiple deep and large biopsies from both the normal and seemingly 
abnormal pleura should be obtained to provide sufficient and adequate samples for diagnosis. The 
diagnosis of MPM should be made on light microscopy combined with appropriate immunohistochemistry 
allowing subtyping according to histology [ESMO 2015]. When thoracoscopy is not feasible or 
contraindicated, ultra-sound guided true cut biopsies can be used. The use of an independent expert 
panel should be asked to confirm the diagnosis particularly in clinical trial or in any case where there is 
doubt about the diagnosis [ERS/ATS Task Force, 2010]. 
Management 
MPM is hard to treat because most patients (80-95%) present with advanced disease.  
There is limited evidence for the efficacy of surgery in patients with MPM. Due to the intricate location and 
relation with other organs, it is virtually impossible to obtain free resection margins. Surgery is limited to 
patients with stage I-III disease.  
Most patients (80%) are diagnosed in stage III/IV  and are not candidates for surgical cure (i.e.  age or 
medical comorbidities). Systemic therapy is a treatment of option aimed at disease control and 
prolonging survival, but poor performance score and low chemo- and radio-sensitivity of the tumour 
result in poor prognosis. MPM is not sensitive to radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is used for a palliative intend 
to provide symptom relief. Without therapy progression is very rapid with a median survival time of 6 to 
9 months. The overall survival has improved with cisplatin therapy. 
For the past 15 years, in patients with advanced or recurrent malignant mesothelioma and fit for 
chemotherapy, the standard of care (SOC) 1L has been a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin, which 
has been shown to be more beneficial than cisplatin monotherapy. With this SOC, patients with MPM have 
a median overall survival (OS) of 12 months and a 5-year survival rate less than 10%. 
Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy also improves the quality of life and relieves some symptoms, such 
as dyspnoea. Although pemetrexed plus cisplatin is the SOC in 1L unresectable MPM, carboplatin is also 
recommended with pemetrexed, particularly in subjects who are unable to tolerate cisplatin. Based on 
published data in chemotherapy-naive subjects with MPM, clinical efficacy is similar between carboplatin- 
and cisplatin-based regimens. 
Improvement  in 1L treatment has been observed by adding anti-angiogenic agents to 
platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy as shown by the Phase 2 Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie 
Thoracique (IFCT)-Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study (MAPS) with bevacizumab in select 
patients. However,  this bevacizumab combination is not approved by health authorities. In this study, 
median OS was improved in the bevacizumab combination arm to 18.8 months compared with 16.1 
months in the pemetrexed and cisplatin control arm, and median PFS was 9.2 months in the bevacizumab 
combination arm compared with 7.3 months in the control arm. As expected, the addition of bevacizumab 
increased the rate of Grade 3/4 toxicity, with more Grade 3 or higher hypertension (23% vs 0) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 11/164 
 
 
 
 
thrombotic events (6% vs 1%) than with control. More patients stopped treatment because of toxic 
effects in the bevacizumab combination arm than in the control arm (24.3% vs. 6.0%). As such, the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
practice guidelines recommend that the triplet regimen of bevacizumab, cisplatin, and pemetrexed may 
be offered to patients with no contraindications to bevacizumab. 
After failure of first line therapy, there is no current second line standard of care. No randomised study 
has shown the benefit of second line chemotherapy on survival of quality of life after failure of primary 
chemotherapy although numerical improvements were observed. The median OS for patients fit for 
chemotherapy after failure of first line platinum/pemetrexed is 6-7 months [Krug 2015; Kindler 2016] 
and it might be prolonged to 8.4 months if treated with second line chemotherapy [Jassem 2008]. 
Immunotherapy in second line mesothelioma  
Recently, also immunotherapy has been investigated in the second line MPM. In the EU, currently no 
immunotherapy treatment is approved in the treatment of relapsed MPM.  
Several checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab,  durvalumab, tremelimumab)  have been 
investigated as monotherapy, in combination or in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of 
relapsed MPM.  
Tremelimumab is the only anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that has been investigated as monotherapy 
in relapsed MPM. Tremelimumab  did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in 
patients previously treated with malignant mesothelioma.  In a trial including a total of patients, the 
median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 7.7 months (95% CI 6.8-8.9) in the 
tremelimumab group and 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.9, 8.7) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.92 [95% CI 
0.76-1.12], p=0·41) [Majo M, et al. Lancet Oncol 2017]. 
Various PD-L1 agents have been investigated in relapsed MPM. Nivolumab  has been investigated as 
monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab.  The reported ORR varies between 26-29%, with a 
reported OS of 11.8-17.3 months. When combined with ipilimumab, higher response rates are observed 
varying from 24-38% with a median OS of 15.9 months (Transl Lung Cancer 2020; 9 (Suppl1): S77-S85).  
In the MAPS2 study, submitted as a supportive study within this application, a numerically larger effect 
with the combined treatment compared with the nivolumab monotherapy e.g. ORR 17% vs. 38% and 
median OS 11.9 vs. 15.9 months was observed. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab  each have distinct, but complementary, mechanisms of action, which may 
enhance responsiveness to the combination regardless of baseline tumour PD-L1 expression (Hamanishi 
et al, 2007; Brahmer et al 2010; Pardoll, 2012; Wang et al, 2014; Das et al, 2015; Wei et al, 2018 and 
2019; ). 
Nivolumab (OPDIVO) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its 
interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  
Ipilimumab (Yervoy) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA-4. CTLA-4 inhibition can induce 
de novo T-cell responses and recruit novel/additional T cells to the tumour. 
OPDIVO indications: 
Melanoma: OPDIVO as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival

(OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour PD 
L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Adjuvant treatment of melanoma: OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of 
adults with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone 
complete resection (see section 5.1). 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab  and 2 cycles of 
platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  in the target population 
The PPK of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination (nivo+ipi) has been previously characterized across 
multiple tumour types including 1L NSCLC. The PPK analysis in NSCLC was performed with these drugs in 
combination with chemotherapy. For this submission, nivolumab and ipilimumab  PPK analyses were 
performed specifically for subjects with MPM receiving these drugs in combination. 
The PPK of nivolumab or ipilimumab in Study CA209743 were well-described by a linear 2-compartment 
model with time-varying CL, which are consistent with a previously reported model of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  in their combination treatment. 
Nivolumab population pharmacokinetics (nivo-PPK) 
The main purpose of the current PPK analysis was to characterize the PK of nivolumab in subjects with 
unresectable MPM in Study CA209743 who received nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  and to 
determine the effects of covariates on nivolumab PK parameters.   
The nivolumab PPK analysis was conducted using data from 13 clinical studies conducted in subjects with 
MPM and other tumour types (NSCLC, melanoma,  RCC, CRC, prostate cancer and HCC) who received 
nivolumab + ipilimumab  and/or chemotherapy combination or nivolumab monotherapy. The data 
included are from 5 Phase 1 or 2 (MDX1106-03, CA209005 [ONO-4538-01], CA209012, CA209063, and 
CA209568 Parts 1 and 2), 7 Phase 3 (CA209017, CA209025, CA209026, CA209057, CA209227 Parts 1 
and 2, CA2099LA, and CA209743), and 1 Phase 3b/4 (CA209817) clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021

The monotherapy studies included in the analysis (MDX-1106-03, CA209005 [ONO-4538-01], 
CA209017, CA209025, CA209026, CA209057, and CA209063) provided data for assessment of 
nivolumab PK when given alone across different tumour types (MPM, SQ and NSQ NSCLC, and other 
tumour types). The additional studies included in the current analysis provided data on nivolumab PK 
administered in combination with ipilimumab in MPM (CA209743), CRC (CA209142), RCC (CA209214), or 
NSCLC (CA209012, CA209227, CA209568 Part 1, and CA209817) or in combination with ipilimumab and 
2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in subjects with NSCLC (CA209568 Part 2 and CA2099LA). 
For the current PPK analysis in MPM and NSCLC subjects, the nivolumab PPK dataset included 19,096 
nivolumab concentrations values from 4943 subjects, including 297 MPM subjects treated with nivo+ipi in 
Study CA209743.  
Model development 
Figure 1. Schematic Overview of Nivolumab Population Pharmacokinetic model development  
The base model was a two-compartment,  zero-order IV infusion PK model, with time-varying CL 
(sigmoidal-Emax function); and a proportional  residual error  model, with random effects on CL, Q, VC, 
VP, and EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The variance of random effect was 
estimated jointly for the two CL parameters  (CL, Q) and for the two volume parameters (VC, VP). The 
base model contained BBWT,  sex, race, GFR, PS, ipilimumab  dosing regimen (3 mg/kg Q3W, 1 mg/kg 
Q3W, 1 mg/kg Q6W, and 1 mg/kg Q12W), chemotherapy, and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W + 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy on CL, BBWT and sex on VC, BBWT on Q, BBWT on VP, and; PS, ipilimumab and ipilimumab 
+ chemotherapy co-administration on EMAX.

Ipilimumab population pharmacokinetics (ipi-PPK) 
The main purpose of the current PPK analysis was to characterize the PK of ipilimumab  in subjects with 
unresectable MPM in Study CA209743 who received nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  and to 
determine the effects of covariates on ipilimumab  PK parameters. 
The ipilimumab PPK analysis was conducted using the data from 12 clinical studies conducted in subjects 
with MPM and other tumour types (NSCLC, melanoma) who received ipilimumab either as monotherapy 
or in combination with nivolumab. The data included are from 7 Phase 1 or 2 (CA184004, CA184007, 
CA184008, CA184022, CA184396, CA209012, and CA209568 Parts 1 and 2), 4 Phase 3 (CA184169, 
CA209227 Part 1, CA2099LA, and CA209743), and 1 Phase 3b/4 (CA209817) clinical studies. 
The monotherapy studies included in the analysis (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, CA184022, and 
CA184396) provided data for assessment of ipilimumab  PK when given alone across different tumour 
types (MPM and melanoma). The additional studies included in the current analysis provided data on 
ipilimumab  PK administered in combination with nivolumab in MPM (CA209743) or NSCLC (CA209012, 
CA209227 Part 1, CA209568 Part 2, and CA209817) or in combination with ipilimumab  and 2 cycles of 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy in subjects with NSCLC (CA209568 Part 2 and CA2099LA). 
For the current PPK analysis, the ipilimumab  PPK dataset included 11,602 ipilimumab  concentration 
values from 3689 subjects, including 295 MPM subjects treated with nivo+ipi in Study CA209743.  
Model development 
The ipilimumab  PPK model was developed in two steps: base and full models. Base model development 
consisted of re-estimating parameters of the previously developed final model (with line of therapy, 
tumour type and nivolumab combination effects removed), which was developed to characterize PK for 
ipilimumab  combination therapy in subjects with NSCLC. The previous full PPK model was developed to 
characterize PK in ipilimumab  combination in previously untreated NSCLC.

Further, clinical subgroup efficacy (OS) across body weight categories in Study CA209743 demonstrated 
that higher body weight subjects may have lower exposures compared with weight-based dosing which 
could be potentially associated with poorer  survival. However, the subjects with higher body weight 
demonstrated better survival than those with lower body weight.

(including potential synergistic interactions between exposure/treatment effects) and efficacy and safety 
in subjects with MPM. 
Exposure-efficacy 
The Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis of efficacy included data from 579 subjects with untreated 
unresectable MPM in Study CA209743, including 295 subjects who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W and for whom estimates of both nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures (Cavg1) 
were available, and 284 subjects who received 6 cycles of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 
or carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5+ (chemotherapy arm).

Model evaluation 
The CPH model fit was evaluated by comparing the model-predicted cumulative time-to-event 
distributions with the corresponding distribution determined by non-parametric K-M analysis. Model 
evaluation of the full model shows that the model-predicted mean (90% CI) of OS is consistent with the 
observed K-M of OS of both treatment arms in CA209743 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab  1 
mg/kg Q6W and chemotherapy) as well as histology, as shown in Figure 26 and Figure 27, respectively.

Model evaluation 
The full CPH model was evaluated by a visual predictive check of the cumulative probability  of the first 
occurrence of a Gr2+ IMAE. Figure 33 presents an evaluation of full model prediction of time-to-event of 
Gr2+ IMAEs by treatment. The model-predicted cumulative probabilities  were in agreement with the 
model predictions for all of the treatments in the analysis data set. Figure 34 presents an evaluation of the

full model by histology and treatment in CA209743. This indicates that the model provides a good 
characterization of the probability of Gr2+ IMAEs for both the treatment arm and histology in CA209743.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has characterized the clinical pharmacology properties of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients 
with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. The modelling strategy, which applied the previously 
developed population PK model across multiple tumour types (base model) and the effects of covariates 
on nivolumab and ipilimumab  PK parameters  was assessed (final model), is endorsed. 
Nivolumab population PK model 
The base model was a two-compartment,  zero-order IV infusion PK model, with time-varying CL 
(sigmoidal-Emax function); a proportional residual error model, with random effects on CL, VC, VP, and 
EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The final population PK model incorporates 
additional covariates representing the effect of tumour type + line of therapy (MPM 1L, NSCLC 1L and 
other vs. NSCLC 2L+) on the CL and EMAX of nivolumab. In general, adequate description of the data was 
observed based on the GOF and pc-VPC, which showed a slight over-prediction of the inter-individual 
random effects causing a wider prediction of exposure in the extreme percentiles compared to the 
experimental data.  
The impact of the covariates selected in the final population PK model were assessed in the forest plot 
(Figure 2). The results suggest a clinically relevant change in Vc and CL in patients with extreme low body 
weights (~20%). Cmin1, Cavg1, Cminss, Cmaxss and Cavgss were >20% lower compared to the 
reference patient, demonstrating that patients with very low body weight would show a clinically relevant 
change in exposure, which may lead to a >20% less exposure with the proposed dosing regimen. The 
concern regarding lower expected exposure in patients with very low body weight (<50kg) is partially 
visible in the exposure-efficacy analysis, which suggested a statistical efficacy improvement  in patients 
with higher body weight compared to patients with lower body weight (<70kg). It is agreed that the 
exposure-efficacy relationship is not only driven by the exposure metrics considered throughout the 
range of body weight but suggests a trend of slightly lower efficacy in patients with low body weights with 
the current regimen. In spite of that, it is not expected that a change in the administration regimen in 
patients with body weight ≤50kg could provide a significant improvement in terms of efficacy.   
Ipilimumab  population PK model 
The base model was a two-compartment  model with zero order IV infusion and first order elimination; 
and a combined proportional and additive residual error model, with random effects on CL, VC and EMAX; 
and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The base model contained BBWT (baseline body 
weight) and BLDH (baseline lactate dehydrogenase) effect on CL, BBWT on VC, Q and VP. An adequate 
description of the data has been presented based on the GOF and pc-VPC. In addition, the pc-VPC 
stratified in MESO patients reflects and over-estimation of the inter-individual random effects, which 
might be of relevance in the prediction of PK exposure metrics in the exposure-response analyses and 
dose selection. 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
A time-to-event model was developed to characterize the probability  of overall survival in patients with 
MPM. This strategy is highly appreciated and endorsed. However, the time-to-event analysis revealed no 
clinical improvement when nivolumab 360 mg Q3W was selected over 3 mg/kg Q2W, which allows to 
conclude that a flat exposure-efficacy relationship was present.  
Exposure-safety relationship 
A time-to-event model was developed to characterize the probability  of adverse events in patients with 
MPM. This strategy is highly appreciated and endorsed. The model is able to characterize the observed 
behaviour and predicted probabilities of Gr2+ IMAEs (immune mediated AEs) using the three dosing

strategies that have been shown. The results suggest negligible impact of Nivo 360 mg Q3W + Ipi 1 
mg/kg 6QW compared to Nivo 240 mg Q2W + Ipi 1 mg/kg 6QW and Nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W + Ipi 1 mg/kg 
6QW, demonstrating the lack of an exposure-safety relationship. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions  on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties  of nivolumab and ipilimumab  in patients with unresectable 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have been provided. The modelling strategy to characterize the 
pharmacokinetic properties  and the exposure-response analyses are endorsed. A previously developed 
population PK model in NSCLC and other types of tumours has been used to predict the time-course of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab  in MPM patients.

Title  of Study 
CA209743: A Phase III, Randomized, Open Label Trial of Nivolumab in Combination with 
Ipilimumab versus Pemetrexed with Cisplatin or Carboplatin as First Line Therapy in 
Unresectable Pleural Mesothelioma 
Methods 
Protocol CA209743 was a randomized (1:1), open-label, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating nivolumab 3 
mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) combined with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) versus 6 cycles of 
pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin as a first line treatment in adults (18 years and older) with 
untreated, unresectable MPM. 
Randomization was stratified according to tumour histology: epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid (sarcomatoid 
or mixed histology subtypes), and gender (male vs. female). A tumour sample was required to be sent to 
the central laboratory for PD-L1 status testing prior to randomization, but the results were not needed for 
randomization. 
This study consisted of three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up.

The study population included adult (≥ 18 years) male and female subjects, ECOG 0-1, with histologically 
proven diagnosis of advanced MPM that was unresectable and not amenable to therapy with curative 
intent (surgery with or without chemotherapy). Determination of epithelioid vs non-epithelioid histology 
was required. No prior therapy for MPM was allowed, nor were prior  treatment with an anti-PD-1, 
anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell 
co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways permitted.

Subject enrolment 
After the subject’s initial eligibility is established and informed consent has been obtained, the subject 
must be enrolled into the study by an interactive web response system (IWRS) to obtain the subject 
number. Every subject that signs the informed consent form must be assigned a subject number in IWRS. 
Once enrolled in IWRS, subjects that have met all eligibility criteria will be ready to be randomized 
through IWRS.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms. Enrolment will 
stop once approximately  600 subjects have been randomized. 
This study permitted the re-enrolment of a subject that had discontinued the study as a pre-treatment 
failure (ie, subject has not been randomized/has not been treated).

Treatments 
Arm  A (Nivolumab/Ipilimumab  Combination): 
Note: 1 cycle= 6 weeks 
•  Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV was administered every 2 weeks (Q2W). 
• 
Ipilimumab  1 mg/kg IV was administered every 6 weeks (Q6W) on the same day as the 
administration of nivolumab. 
•  On the day of infusion of both nivolumab and ipilimumab, nivolumab was to be administered first. 
The infusion time for nivolumab was 30 minutes. Ipilimumab was always infused after nivolumab 
and would start at least 30 minutes after the completion of the nivolumab infusion. The infusion 
time for ipilimumab  was 30 minutes. 
•  Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W could continue up to 24 months, or until 
the progression of disease, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study 
closure. Subjects could discontinue ipilimumab  only and continue treatment with nivolumab if 
requirements were met.  No dose modifications or dose reductions of nivolumab or ipilimumab 
were allowed. Subjects receiving ipilimumab  in combination with nivolumab that had 
drug-related toxicities that met the criteria for dose delay, had both drugs delayed until 
retreatment criteria were met. 
• 
Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed and BICR confirmed progression as defined by 
adapted modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (m-RECIST) for pleural 
mesothelioma and RECIST 1.1, was permitted if the subject had investigator-assessed clinical 
benefit and was tolerating treatment. 
Arm  B (Control Arm): 
Note: 1 cycle= 3 weeks 
• 
Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), as a 10-min IV infusion plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC  
of 5 mg/mL/min) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, for 6 cycles or until disease progression and 
unacceptable toxicity. The use of cisplatin was preferred, however carboplatin could be used at 
the discretion of the investigator, and the reason for using carboplatin instead of cisplatin had to 
be reported in the case report  form (CRF) and switching was allowed. Arm B dose calculations 
were administered according to label and/or local policy in terms of infusion schema (including 
but not limited to hydration protocols).  Dose reductions were permitted for chemotherapy, per 
protocol.   
•  Vitamins B12 and B9 supplementation and dexamethasone premedication were required for all 
subjects receiving pemetrexed. Dexamethasone could be administered as IV infusion on the day 
of treatment as required by pemetrexed label and/or local SoC. 
Dosing schedules for both groups are detailed in Table 20 The first dose of study drug was to be 
administered within 3 days of randomization.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 72/164 
 
 
 
 
 
•  OS: defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. OS was followed 
up at FU visits 1 and 2 and then every 3 months thereafter (via visit, phone or email). A subject 
who had not died was censored at the date of last contact (or “last known alive date”). OS was 
censored at the date of randomization for subjects who were randomized but had no follow-up. 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  PFS: (primary definition) defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
first documented tumour progression, based on BICR assessment (mRECIST and/or RECIST v1.1 
criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  
o  Subjects who died without a reported progression were considered to have progresses on 
the date of their death.  
o  Subjects who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable 
tumour assessment.  
o  Subjects who received subsequent anticancer therapy prior  to documented progression 
were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumour assessment conducted on or prior 
to the date of initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. 
o  Subjects who did not have a documented progression and received subsequent 
anticancer therapy were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumour assessment 
conducted on or prior  to the initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. 
o  PFS (PFS2, secondary definition) was irrespective of subsequent therapy and did not 
account for subsequent therapy. 
•  ORR: was defined as the number of randomized subjects who achieve a best response of CR or 
PR based on BICR assessments (m-RECIST and/or RECIST v1.1) divided by the number of all 
randomized subjects. As part of the evaluation of ORR, DoR and TTR were evaluated: 
o  DoR: was defined as the time between the date of first documented response (CR or PR) 
to the date of the first documented tumour progression as determined by the BICR (per 
adapted m-RECIST and/or RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Subjects who started subsequent therapy without a prior  reported 
progression were censored at the last evaluable tumour assessments prior to initiation of 
the subsequent anticancer therapy. DoR was evaluated for responders (confirmed CR or 
PR) only. 
o  TTR: was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first confirmed 
documented response (CR or PR), as assessed by the BICR. TTR was evaluated for 
responders (confirmed CR or PR) only. 
•  DCR: was defined as the proportion  of all randomized subjects whose BOR was CR, PR or SD per 
adapted m-RECIST and/or RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by BICR. 
•  PD-L1: PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells membrane  staining in a 
minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells per validated Dako PD-L1 IHC assay. This was referred to 
as quantifiable PD-L1 expression. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
•  Safety: the assessment of safety was based on the incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, AEs leading to dose modification, select AEs for EU Submission, IMAEs for US 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021

Submission, OESIs, and deaths. In addition, clinical laboratory tests, and immunogenicity (ie, 
development of anti-drug antibody) were analyzed. 
•  Serum anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing anti-drug antibody (NAb) response to nivo+ipi. 
•  EQ-5D-3LLCSS-Meso ASBI score 
Sample size 
The study accounted for a primary  endpoint: OS. Overall two-sided alpha (type I error  rate) was set at 
0.05 for evaluating OS. Approximately 600 subjects were to be randomized with 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment 
arms (actual was 605 randomized). 473 OS events were needed for the final analysis. The sample size 
was calculated to compare OS between nivolumab combined with ipilimumab (Arm A) vs pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin or carboplatin regimen (Arm B). One formal interim analysis was planned for OS at 403 OS 
events. Table 2 summarizes the key parameters of trial design. 
Overall survival: The key design parameters  are shown in Table 2, where OS endpoint utilized a group 
sequential design (GSD) with one interim analysis at 403 OS events and final analysis at 473 OS events. 
Stopping boundaries of GSD at the interim and final OS analyses were derived based on the exact number 
of deaths using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. Given an accrual 
rate of 34 subjects per month, it was estimated that it would take approximately  38/56 months to 
observe the required number of events for the interim/final OS analysis. 
An exponential distribution was assumed for the OS time of control Arm  B with a median OS time of 16 
months and hazard rate of 0.043. To capture some observed features on the survival curves of 
immunotherapies, a piecewise exponential model was assumed for the survival time on nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab arm. In particular, a piecewise exponential with hazard rates of 0.043, 0.033, and 0.0001 in 
the following post first dose time windows: first 6-months, 6 months to 34 months, and after 34 months, 
provided a delay of treatment effect in the first 6 months, an exponential distribution of OS from 6 months 
to 34 months, and a long term  survival rate plateau starting approximately  at 34 months. Simulation 
evaluation of trial design show that the above piecewise exponential distribution would produce a 90% 
power in log-rank test with 606 randomized subjects. The numerical value of type one error  rate in 
simulation was 0.05.  
The above sample  size calculation was based on a simulation model incorporating aspects of 
immuno-oncology therapies like delayed separation and long-term benefit using EAST 6.

Randomisation 
Once enrolled in IWRS, subjects that have met all eligibility criteria will be ready to be randomized 
through IWRS.  The following information is required for subject randomization: 
•  Subject number 
•  Date of birth 
•  Gender at birth 
• 
Tumour histology: epithelioid vs sarcomatoid or mixed histology 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms. Enrollment will stop once 
approximately  600 subjects have been randomized. The exact procedures for using the IWRS  will be 
detailed in the IWRS  manual. 
Blinding (masking) 
CA209743 was an open-label study. The study team only utilized subject-level data listings for the 
purpose of fulfilling Sponsor responsibilities for routine monitoring, safety assessment, and data review in 
accordance with the Data Review Plan. Measures to preclude dissemination of clinical trial data included 
procedural and technical access controls and use of independent third-parties for the Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) and the preparation of analysis datasets. The personnel who conducted the PD-L1 
testing were blinded to treatment group assignment of individuals during the conduct of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Before the analyses for this study report  were conducted, the protocol-defined statistical analyses were 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) as follow:

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline laboratory results will be summarized by treatment arm as randomized using 
descriptive statistics for all randomized subjects 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint analyses 
The distribution of OS will be compared in two randomized arms at the interim and final analysis via a 
two-sided, log-rank test stratified by histology and gender with an overall significance level of 0.05. A 
group sequential testing procedure will be applied to OS to control the overall type I error for interim and 
final analyses. The hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding two-sided 100x (1-adjusted α) % confidence 
intervals (CI) will be estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazards model using randomized arm as a 
single covariate. The OS curves for each randomized arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
product-limit method. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for median OS will be computed by 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using log-log transformation). Survival rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 
months and 5 year will be estimated using KM estimates on the OS curve for each randomized arm 
provided minimum follow-up is longer than time-point to generate the rate. Associated two-sided 95% 
CIs will be calculated using the Greenwood formula (using log-log transformation). 
Secondary endpoints analyses 
ORRs or DCRs and their corresponding 95% exact CIs will be calculated using the Clopper- Pearson 
method for each treatment group.  
The PFS curves for each randomized arm will be estimated using the KM product-limit method. Two-sided, 
95% confidence intervals for median PFS will be computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using 
log-log transformation). PFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 months and 5 year will be estimated using KM 
estimates on the PFS curve for each randomized arm provided minimum follow-up is longer than 
timepoint to generate the rate. Associated two-sided 95% Cis will be calculated using the Greenwood 
formula (using log-log transformation). 
Interim Analyses  
A formal interim analysis for the OS is planned after 403 deaths have been observed, which are expected 
to occur approximately 38 months after study initiation. This formal comparison of OS will allow for early 
stopping for superiority. Lan-DeMets α spending function with O’Brien and Fleming type of boundary will

be used. The stopping boundary will depend on the actual number of deaths at the time of the interim 
analysis. However, if the analysis were performed exactly at 403 deaths, the study could be stopped by 
the DMC for superiority if the p-value is < 0.03. An independent statistician external to BMS will perform 
the analysis. If the study continues beyond the interim analysis the nominal significance level for the final 
look after 473 deaths would be 0.041. All events in the database at the time of the lock will be used. If 
number of final events exceeds the number specified per protocol (473 deaths), final boundary will not be 
recalculated using updated information fraction at interim. In addition to the formal planned interim 
analysis for OS, the DMC will have access to periodic unblinded interim reports of efficacy and safety to 
allow a risk/benefit assessment. No formal test will be performed and the study will not stop for 
superiority. 
Safety 
The safety analysis will be performed in all treated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safety will be 
presented using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 by treatment arm.  All on-treatment AEs, drug-related AEs, late emergent 
drug-related AEs, SAEs and drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using worst Grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 
criteria by system organ class and preferred term.  On-study lab parameters  including haematology, 
chemistry, liver function and renal function will be summarized using worst Grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 
criteria.

Percentages based on subjects entering period.                                                  
[A] Includes subjects who achieved max duration of therapy per protocol, i.e: Chemo: 6 cycles, 
Nivo+Ipi: 2 years                                  
The CRF did not have an option for treatment discontinuation due to subjects completing the maximum 
duration of treatment per protocol (2 years of nivo+ipi or 6 cycles of chemotherapy) and therefore, this 
action was captured as “not reported” on the CRF as a reason for treatment discontinuation. The majority 
of subjects discontinuing treatment for reason “not reported”, had actually completed treatment. For 
example,  of the 189 chemotherapy-treated subjects with reason off treatment “not reported”, 176 
(93.1%) subjects received all 6 cycles (the maximum allowed duration of chemotherapy per protocol).  
Per protocol, nivolumab could be continued alone as monotherapy in the event ipilimumab  was 
discontinued. However, if nivolumab was discontinued, ipilimumab could not be continued alone. In the 
nivo+ipi arm, 28 (9.3%) subjects discontinued ipilimumab early (Table 23).

A majority of subjects in both treatment arms received ≥ 90% of planned doses. The median duration of 
therapy was longer in the nivo+ipi arm, 5.55 months, compared with 3.48 months in the chemotherapy 
arm.  23.7% of subjects received more than 12 months nivo+ipi treatment. The maximum duration of 
treatment per protocol was 24 months for nivo+ipi, and 6 cycles of chemotherapy. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 25-May-2016. There were 2 global revisions to the protocol 
as summarized in Table 24 and the figure 37 below.  In addition, a total of 8 administrative letters were 
issued for this study.

The trial was subject to 2 amendments dated 13-Oct-2017 and 25-Apr-2019 according to the figure 
above.  
Within the first amendment (revised protocol 01) the protocol was revised to provide clarity in tumour 
lesion measurement definition and radiological assessments per modified RECIST for mesothelioma and 
RECIST 1.1. 
The second amendment (revised Protocol 02) included two major  changes: 
•  Change of PFS from co-primary  to secondary endpoint and removal of hierarchical testing of 
secondary endpoints. 
•  Update of statistical assumption for primary  analysis 
o  Change in delay in treatment effect assumption from 4 months to 6 months in piecewise 
exponential model for OS in Arm  A  
o  Assumption for median OS of Arm B changed from 15 months to 16 months 
Rationale for the changes 
There were two distinct reasons for changing PFS from primary  to secondary endpoint: 
•  Disease-specific reason: Based on FDA guidance (Dec-2018) that ORR and PFS assessments 
could be imprecise in tumours where there was a lack of demarcated margins, as in 
mesothelioma.  
•  Experience and observation with immuno-oncology regimens: PFS and ORR may not adequately 
characterize the long-term benefit of immune-oncology treatment. There was increased evidence 
in immunotherapy trials showing that PFS was quite often not a very reliable endpoint to assess 
clinical benefit, particularly when the comparator  was chemotherapy. 
The statistical assumptions were modified (changed delayed separation from 4 to 6 months, and median 
chemotherapy from 15 to 16 months) for the following reasons: 
•  Data with IO including nivo + ipi vs. chemotherapy in NSCLC showing ≈ 6 months delayed 
separation. 
•  Recently published data of median OS in mesothelioma studies (MAPS and LUME), indicated 
better survival outcome for platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Other changes and revisions to the main protocol are summarized in Table 24.

arm and 11 (3.6%) patients in the chemotherapy treatment arm.   
Baseline PD-L1 Tumour Cell Expression 
Subjects were required to provide a tumour sample (archival or current formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
[FFPE] tumour tissue) to central laboratory  for PD-L1 (Dako 28-8 IHC) testing during the Screening 
period. Testing result was not required prior  to randomization. Subjects were randomized regardless of 
PD-L1 status. 
Table 30. Frequency of PD-L1 Tumour Cell Expression Status - All Randomized Subjects 
Subjects with non-epithelioid MPM had higher PD-L1 expression than subjects with epithelioid MPM (data 
not shown). 
Subjects with “PD-L1 expression missing” were subjects with no tumour tissue sample available for 
evaluation.

discontinuation, but an incorrect start date for bevacizumab was reported in the database at the 
time of the CSR DBL. A correction will be reflected in the next safety update. 
Based on clinical review,  the majority  of the prior surgeries listed were diagnostic procedures and/or 
biopsies of tumour as mandated by the protocol, or palliative surgery. 
Treatment beyond progression 
Subjects in the nivo+ipi arm were permitted to continue on nivo+ipi treatment beyond initial adapted 
m-RECIST for mesothelioma and/or RECIST 1.1 defined PD as long as they provided consent and met all 
protocol criteria for clinical benefit and tolerance of study drug. 
The study included BICR for imaging assessment by a vendor, ERT [Previously BioMedical Systems] 
(Seattle, Washington). Per protocol, BICR-confirmed PD was required prior to treatment discontinuation. 
ERT imaging charter and Site Procedure Manual outlined the expectation of the turnaround time (TAT), ie, 
imaging scans submission from sites to occur within 3 days of imaging collection, and BICR imaging 
assessment to be sent to sites within 5 days. Protocol and protocol guidance documents allowed the 
Principal Investigator to make the initial assessment of progression and the treatment beyond 
progression decision (with Medical Monitor’s approval), to ensure the safety and risk benefit assessment 
for the subjects on the trial. Additional protocol guidance included an algorithm for decision making after 
Investigator assessment of PD to ensure the process to determine Medical Monitor approval  for 
Treatment beyond Progression was taken into consideration. 
Following the report of delayed BICR PD reporting, the MAH assessed the impact of turnaround delays on 
patient safety:  
• 
• 
Five subjects on nivo+ipi arm (Arm A) with confirmed BICR PD and a BICR PD TAT delay were 
treated beyond progression without Medical Monitor's approval.  All of the safety assessments 
were reviewed for these subjects and there was no significant impact overall on patient safety.  
Forty-eight subjects that did not have confirmed BICR PD, and no BICR PD delay, came off 
treatment due to investigator assessed PD; this included 34 subjects on Arm A and 14 subjects on 
control Arm  B. There was no impact on patient safety. 
•  Seven subjects that did not have confirmed BICR PD, and had BICR PD TAT delay, came off 
treatment due to investigator assessed PD; this included 5 subjects on treatment arm  A and 
2 subjects on the chemotherapy arm (Arm  B). There was no impact on patient safety. 
•  No subjects with confirmed BICR PD and without BICR PD TAT delay were treated beyond 
progression. There was no impact on patient safety. 
Despite the BICR PD reporting delay, there was no critical impact to the validity of study data. 
Concordance between BICR and Investigator PFS assessments was high, with a concordance rate of 
82.5% in the nivo+ipi arm and 80.8% on the chemotherapy arm.  Ultimately, investigator-assessed PD 
and subject risk benefit for treatment beyond progression were the basis of clinical decisions for all 
subjects. 
Discontinuation of Study Therapy 
At DBL, 98.3% of subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and 100% of subjects in the chemotherapy arm  had 
discontinued treatment as of the DBL. 
Subjects treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab  could discontinue ipilimumab  and continue to receive 
nivolumab (partial discontinuation); however, if nivolumab was discontinued, ipilimumab could not be 
continued alone as monotherapy.

Separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves of OS favoring nivo+ipi over chemotherapy occurred at around 5 
months and was sustained. The proportional hazards assumption for OS was validated using a stratified 
Cox regression model with a time-dependent interaction covariate, which was not significant (Figure 38).

Median follow-up for OS (median time from clinical cut-off date to randomization date) was 29.7 months 
for all randomized subjects. 
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects in both arms; 83.5% and 82.5% of subjects in 
the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms, respectively, either died or had a last known alive date on or after 
15-Jan-2020.

OS by IRT Stratification Factor – Histology 
Nivo+ipi demonstrated an improvement  in OS compared with chemotherapy, regardless of histology 
(Table 38 and Figure 39). The observed treatment effect of nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy was larger in 
subjects with non-epithelioid MPM compared with epithelioid MPM (HR: 0.46 vs 0.85).  
Within the nivo+ipi arm, the median OS were similar across histologies (18.73 and 16.89 months for 
epithelioid and non-epithelioid, respectively). In the chemotherapy arm,  subjects with non-epithelioid 
histology presented lower median OS than epithelioid (8.80 vs 16.23 months), confirming histology as a 
prognostic factor in MPM subjects receiving chemotherapy. 
24-month OS rates in subjects with epithelioid histology were 41.2% and 31.8% in the nivo+ipi and 
chemotherapy arms,  respectively. In subjects with non-epithelioid histology, 24-month OS rates were 
39.5% and 9.7% in the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms, respectively.

OS in Other Predefined Subsets 
The HRs for OS favoured (HR <1) nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy in the majority of pre-defined subgroups with 
the exception of subjects with age ≥75, Stage I/II disease, and subjects who received prior radiotherapy 
(Figure 41).  
The treatment effect of nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy was larger in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours (≥ 
1%) than in subjects with PD-L1 negative tumours (<1%) (HR: 0.69 vs 0.94). Further exploration of 
efficacy by PD-L1 expression is presented below.

Efficacy by Platinum Backbone (Ad hoc Analysis) 
An ad hoc KM OS analysis by arm was conducted based on the ‘as randomized’ population with the 
chemotherapy arm split into 3 subgroups defined by the actual treatment received in Cycle 1 (Figure 42). 
The subgroup ‘OTHER’ referred to subjects randomized to chemotherapy but never treated (n = 18). 
29/104 (28%) subjects switched from cisplatin to carboplatin after Cycle 1. The OS HR for nivo+ipi vs 
pemetrexed+cisplatin was similar to nivo+ipi vs pemetrexed+carboplatin (0.79 [95% CI: 0.60, 1.03] vs 
0.74 [95% CI: 0.60, 0.92]). The treatment effect was similar regardless of platinum-based treatment 
choice.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
PFS 
The nivo+ipi arm did not show an advantage over the chemotherapy arm in PFS. The median PFS per 
BICR was 6.77 (95% CI: 5.59, 7.36) months in the nivo+ipi arm and 7.20 (95% CI: 6.93, 8.05) months 
in the chemotherapy arm (HR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.21]) (Table 40). 
•  The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS was lower with nivo+ipi compared with chemotherapy. 
After 6-months, the PFS rates were higher with nivo+ipi (Table 41), 
•  The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS showed an advantage for chemotherapy during the initial part of 
the curve with the curves crossing at approximately  8 months and then subsequently favouring 
nivo+ipi (Figure 43). 
•  At database lock, 28.1% and 30.8% of randomized subjects in the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy 
arms,  respectively, were censored for PFS. 
•  Concordance between BICR and Investigator PFS assessments was high, with a concordance rate 
of 82.5% in the nivo+ipi arm  and 80.8% on the chemotherapy arm.

The HRs for PFS favoured (HR < 1) nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy in subjects with sarcomatoid histology and 
PD-L1 positive tumours (≥ 1% PD-L1). The HRs favoured (HR > 1) chemotherapy vs nivo+ipi in subjects 
with Stage I disease and PD-L1 negative tumours (< 1% PD-L1) (Figure 46).

Median TTR per BICR was 2.69 months for all confirmed responders in the nivo+ipi arm, and 2.53 months 
for all confirmed responders in the chemotherapy arm  (Table 45).  
The median DoR was longer for confirmed responders in the nivo+ipi arm  relative to the chemotherapy 
arm (11.01 [95% CI: 8.11, 16.49] vs 6.67 [95% CI: 5.32, 7.10] months, respectively). 69% and 53% of 
responders in the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms,  respectively, had a DoR of at least 6 months. 
Separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves for DoR occurred at approximately 2 months and favoured nivo+ipi 
over chemotherapy. At DBL, 38.3% of subjects in the nivo+ipi arm  and 22.5% of subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm were censored for DoR per BICR (Figure 47).

Efficacy According to PD-L1 Expression 
Efficacy by PD-L1 expression was assessed as a secondary endpoint in this study. However, the study was 
not stratified by PD-L1; therefore it is not powered to assess treatment effect by PD-L1 expression.  
Efficacy according to PD-L1 expression was explored in the PD-L1 evaluable population which represented 
96.9% of the All Randomized population. OS in subjects with ≥ 1% baseline PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 
positive) was consistent with the results seen in the All Randomized population. The improvement in OS 
with nivo+ipi treatment over chemotherapy was larger in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours (HR for < 
1% and ≥ 1% PD-L1 was 0.94 and 0.69, respectively.  
For PFS per BICR, opposite treatment effects were observed by PD-L1 expression. A benefit of nivo+ipi 
over chemotherapy was observed in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours (HR: 0.81), while in the 
subjects with PD-L1 negative tumours, the PFS HR was 1.79 favouring chemotherapy (Table 47). 
Consistent with the All Randomized population, ORR per BICR was similar in both treatment arms in 
subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours. The ORR in subjects with PD-L1 negative tumours was numerically 
lower for nivo+ipi compared with chemotherapy (21.1% vs. 38.5%). However, the PD-L1 <1% subgroup 
has a modest sample size, providing for limited event counts in the context of time to event analyses.

Efficacy results by Region 
Of the randomized subjects in CA209743, 9.8% (59/605) were from North America, 58.2% (352/605) 
were from Europe, 10.7% (65/605) were from Asia, and 21.3% (129/605) were from the rest of the 
world. Efficacy was observed across regions (HR < 1) nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy, including the subgroup 
of subjects from North America  (HR = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.03]), Europe (HR = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.60, 
0.99]), and Asia (HR = 0.97 [95% CI: 0.56, 1.69]) however, it should be noted the Asian sample size was 
small.

Clinical  studies in special populations 
No specific study was conducted for patients aged ≥75 years. The results of this subgroup of elderly 
patients of Study CA209743 are provided below. 
157 subjects aged ≥75 years were included in Study CA209743, 6 of them were ≥85.  78 subjects were 
randomized to the nivo+ipi arm and 79 to the chemotherapy treatment arm. 
Regarding efficacy results in this population, the observed median OS was 16.92 (95% CI: 11.04, 20.83) 
months for the nivo+ipi arm and 15.38 (95% CI: 11.73, 18.43) months for the chemotherapy group; HR 
1.02 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.48).  
Median PFS in the nivo+ipi group was 5.36 (95% CI: 4.04, 7.06) months and 8.15 (95% CI: 6.80, 9.69) 
months for the chemotherapy treatment arm; HR 1.25 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.81).  
The observed ORR was 33/78 (42.3%; 95% CI: 31.2, 54.0) for the nivo+ipi arm and 40/79 (50.6%; 95% 
CI: 39.1, 62.1) for the chemotherapy group. The DoR was not reported. 
Supportive study 
Study IFCT-1501 MAPS 2: A randomized Phase II Study evaluating Efficacy and Safety of 2nd 
or 3rd line treatment by Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab for 
unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) patients. 
Study MAPS 2 was an interventional, multi-center, open-label, randomized and non-comparative phase II 
study. This study was performed in 21 active centers in France, from Mar-2016 to Aug-2018. 
It evaluated nivolumab monotherapy, or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, for the treatment of  
unresectable MPM in subjects who had documented progression on or after 1 or 2 previous lines of 
chemotherapy, including at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 into the following treatment groups and stratified by histological subtype 
(epithelioid vs sarcomatoid or biphasic), line of treatment (second- vs third-line), and sensitivity to 
platinum/pemetrexed treatment (progression ≥ 3 months vs < 3 months):  
•  Nivolumab (N = 63): nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, over 60 min. 
•  Nivolumab + ipilimumab (N = 62): nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W over 60 min + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q6W over 90 min.

Subjects were treated for up to 2 years from randomization or until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or until other protocol-specified reasons for discontinuation were met. Tumour assessments 
occurred every 12 weeks (± 1 week) from the first dose until progression or treatment discontinuation. 
Subjects could continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1-defined PD – at CT-scan assessment at 
Week 12 – if they met all the following criteria: 
• 
Investigator-assessed clinical benefit, and subjects did not have rapid PD 
•  Continued to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria 
•  Good tolerance of study drug(s) 
•  Stable ECOG PS 
The primary  study endpoint, DCR at 12 weeks, was assessed by the Investigator using the modified 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) 1.1 criteria for mesothelioma.  The following 
secondary variables were also collected: PFS, OS, QOL, predictive value of PD-L1 and prognosis impact of 
biomarkers. 
Results 
Demographic and disease characteristics 
125 subjects were included, 63 to the nivolumab arm and 62 to the nivo+ipi arm. Median age was 71.8 
years, 80% of patients were male and 58.4% of subjects were former or current smokers.  84% of 
patients had epithelioid histology, 68.8% of subjects had received one prior  treatment line and 28.8% 
two. Regarding PD-L1, 41.4% were considered positive (≥1% expression).

Primary  endpoint 
In the pre-specified EP population, DCR at 12 weeks was achieved in 44.4% of subjects in the nivolumab 
arm and 50.0% of subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm, as re-evaluated by the BICR according 
to the mRECIST 1.1 criteria. In the ITT population, 25 (39.7%; [95% CI: 27.6 - 51.8]) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm  and 32 (51.6%; [95% CI: 39.2 - 64.1]) subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm 
reached DCR at 12 weeks after re-evaluation by the BICR. 
Secondary endpoints 
The mPFS was 3.97 months [95% CI: 2.79 - 5.68] in the nivolumab arm and 5.44 months [95% CI: 3.0 
6 - 8.21] in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. The mOS was 11.86 months [95% CI: 6.73 - 17.44] in 
the nivolumab arm and 15.93 months [95% CI: 10.68 - 22.21] in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm. 
Evaluations of QOL showed that more  than 42.0% of subjects had declined at 12 weeks for the general 
and symptom distress in the nivolumab arm and for interference with daily activities, fatigue and anorexia 
in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm. 
DCR, independently of the treatment arm,  was achieved in 24 of 48 (41.4% [95% CI: 28.7 - 54.1]) 
PD-L1-negative subjects (i.e. IHC score <1%). vs 22 of 41 (53.7% [95% CI: 38.4 - 68.9]) PD-L1-positive 
subjects (i.e. IHC score ≥1%). Using a 25% cut-off as the threshold of high PD-L1 expression, DCR was 
achieved in 6 of 7 (85.7% [95% CI: 59.8 - 100.0]) high-PD-L1 and 40 of 92 (43.5% [95% CI: 33.3 - 53.6] 
low-PD-L1 subjects. 
In the nivolumab arm,  but not in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm, subjects with progression ≥ 3 
months on previous chemotherapy with cisplatin/pemetrexed had a longer survival than those with 
progression before 3 months (HR=0.42 [0.23; 0.74]; p=0.003).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The open-label design is considered acceptable although a double-blind design is preferable; nonetheless 
the difficulties to blind the study due to differences in infusion regimens and toxicities of chemotherapy 
compared with immunotherapy are acknowledged. The chosen comparator, platinum in combination with  
pemetrexed up to 6 cycles, is considered adequate, as it represents the standard of care treatment for 1L 
MPM patients.  
MPM diagnosis is difficult and it is not confirmed by central review in  this study. In the inclusion criteria it 
is stated that subjects must have histological proven diagnosis and thoracoscopy is highly recommended, 
but it is not the only available method to obtain the sample and other methods were allowed. 
Thoracoscopy is the preferred diagnostic method, according to several guidelines, because it allows 
obtaining proper  tissue samples for a histological diagnosis but it is acknowledged that not all patients 
would be candidates for this procedure and not all procedures performed would be successful in obtaining 
such samples, therefore, this approach is acceptable as long as the diagnosis was confirmed. 
Regarding disease baseline characteristics, patients included were required to have unresectable MPM. 
Surgical staging based on TNM system is preferred and it is a predictor of prognosis, therefore baseline 
disease stage based on TNM staging system was provided upon request and they were mostly balanced 
between both arms. 
The sample size calculations and operating characteristics of the sample size estimation are clearly 
described and considered acceptable. Regarding the general methods established for the statistical 
analyses, the assumptions are agreeable. 
In the pivotal study submitted for the additional indication in MPM, nivolumab was administered as a 3 
mg/kg dose 30-min infusion Q2W, in combination with ipilimumab  1 mg/kg as a 30-min infusion Q6W. 
Nevertheless, the proposed dosage regimen for this new indication is nivolumab 360 mg Q3W (flat dose). 
This 360 mg dosing was used, in combination with ipilimumab  and 2 cycles of platinum-based 
chemotherapy in Study CA2099LA for 1L NSCLC. In light of the provided PK-PD modelling study the 
proposed dose regimen approach is considered acceptable.  
The comparator arm consisted of platinum based pemetrexed. In the EU, only the cisplatin combination 
is approved. However,  the ESMO guideline mentions also carboplatin, particularly in elderly patients as 
cisplatin is more toxic than carboplatin. Therefore, the currently provided comparator  arm  is accepted.  
Efficacy assessments for the secondary objectives were based on the radiological response by modified 
RECIST for mesothelioma or RECIST 1.1 criteria.  The first amendment of study CA209743 protocol 
(revised protocol  01) included an update on measurement definitions for mesothelioma lesions per 
modified RECIST and radiographic assessment criteria per mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, aimed at providing 
clarity for these evaluations. There was a potential risk for inconsistency in the efficacy assessment 
during the conduct of the trial so the MAH was requested to provide the baseline characteristics and 
efficacy data (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) of patients included before and after this amendment, which occurred 
when a total of 411/605 (68%) subjects had already been enrolled and 323/605 (53.4%) had been 
randomized. With regards to the reported efficacy results, some differences were expected to be found in 
secondary endpoints, as the amendment included a re-definition of the radiology assessment of these 
endpoints. The reported median PFS for both groups did not significantly change before and after the 
implementation of the amendment, i.e. the reported HR (95% CI) was 0.91 (0.69, 1.19) and 1.09 (0.82, 
1.45), respectively. The reported HR for the overall population was already of 1.00 (0.82, 1.21) that, as 
previously discussed did not support PFS benefit and, in fact, numerically favoured the chemotherapy arm 
Assessment report

vs. the nivo+ipi arm. The same discordance/trend was shown in the new data provided. Although the ORR 
results are not highly affected by the revision, there was a remarkable before/after difference for the DOR 
in the immunotherapy group: 14.59 vs. 8.18 months respectively. In the chemotherapy arm, the DOR 
was also reduced after the amendment (7.03 vs. 5.68 months) but the difference was not as worrying as 
in the nivo+ipi arm. The MAH was asked to discuss these results, based on the possibility that the change 
in radiological assessment introduced by the amendment could have led to a different assessment of the 
responses. The MAH clarified that the same criteria were applied during all the trial and the amendment 
was only intended to adapt the protocol to the criteria already used by the BICR. Unbalances regarding 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics for subjects randomized before and after the 
amendment were again analysed. Although some slight unbalances across arms before and after the 
amendment are observed that could have played a role (most likely differences in the distribution of 
patients by histology and PD-L1 expression), and although a level of uncertainty still remains, there 
appears to be no strong justification to question the reliability of radiologically assessed endpoints based 
on the differences found in the requested post-hoc analysis. In addition, it is considered that PFS, ORR 
and DOR results are of interest for prescribers and therefore have been included in the PI, along with an 
explicit reference to their descriptive nature.  
Randomization was performed by IWRS and stratified according to histology and gender, which are 
well-known prognostic factors for MPM. Subjects were stratified in two groups: epithelioid and 
non-epithelioid histology, being this last one associated with poorer responses to standard chemotherapy 
and worse prognosis. As mentioned above, histology (epithelioid or non-epithelioid) and sex (male or 
female) were stratification factors in this study. Discrepancies between IRT and CRF have been observed. 
The rate of discrepancies between IRT and CRF was low in both the nivo+ipi (2.3% for histology and 0.3% 
for sex) and chemotherapy (4.0% for histology and 0.3% for sex) arms. The discrepancy rate did not 
exceed the limit of 10% non-concordance that would have triggered additional OS sensitivity analyses, as 
pre-specified in the SAP.  
The PD-L1 expression was not a stratification factor nevertheless the difference between “subjects with 
indeterminate PD-L1 expression at baseline” and “subjects with PD-L1 expression at baseline not 
evaluable” is the former had tumour cell membrane  staining hampered for reasons attributed to the 
biology of the tumour tissue sample and not because of improper  sample preparation or handling, 
whereas the latter provided a tumour tissue sample but it was not optimally  collected or prepared. 
. Revised protocol  02 (issued 25-Apr-2019) included some major  changes in the study endpoints and 
planned analyses. PFS per modified RECIST 1.1 by BICR, initially co-primary endpoint, was changed into 
a secondary endpoint. OS, as primary  endpoint, is acceptable and the change of PFS from being a 
co-primary endpoint to be included as a secondary endpoint is acknowledged and accepted from a clinical 
point of view, also considering that PFS as well as ORR per RECIST 1.1 and DOR (collected as additional 
secondary endpoints) are somewhat difficult to measure in mesothelioma, because the tumour lack of 
demarcated margins. Of note, the hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints was removed so no formal 
testing of secondary objectives was done, and the results were descriptive. The reason behind the 
removal of the hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints was that statistically significant differences 
were not expected in any of those endpoints between the combination and chemotherapy which, in 
addition, were not expected to correlate to a survival benefit for the reasons stated above. The approach  
followed is understood and can be agreed to. 
The included protocol deviations did not seem to have an impact on the analyses or conclusions of primary 
endpoint, which was OS.

Efficacy data and additional  analyses 
The primary  efficacy endpoint (OS) and the secondary endpoint (PFS) were compared using a stratified 
log-rank test at the time of the interim analysis for OS that was conducted on 17 April  2020 when 419 
(89%) of the total OS events planned had occurred. Study CA209743 met its primary  endpoint of OS. 
Nivo+ipi demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant 4.0 months improvement in OS 
compared to chemotherapy: i.e. median OS of 18.07 months (95% CI: 16.82, 21.45) for nivo+ipi vs. 
14.09 months (95% CI: 12.45, 16.23) for the chemotherapy arm  [HR=0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.89), 
stratified log-rank test p value=0.0020]. Separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves of OS favouring nivo+ipi 
over chemotherapy occurred at around 5 months and was sustained but crossing of the curves before that 
point is observed. 
On the contrary, PFS or ORR showed no improvement for the combination. The median PFS per BICR 
numerically favoured the chemotherapy combination, i.e.  6.77 (95% CI: 5.59, 7.36) months in the 
nivo+ipi arm and 7.20 (95% CI: 6.93, 8.05) months in the chemotherapy arm, though HR = 1.00 (95% 
CI: 0.82, 1.21). BICR assessed ORR was 39.6% (95% CI: 34.1, 45.4) in the nivo+ipi arm and 42.7% 
(95% CI: 37.1, 48.5) in the chemotherapy arm. Some durable responses were identified: the median DoR 
was longer for confirmed responders in the nivo+ipi arm relative to the chemotherapy arm (11.01 [95% 
CI: 8.11, 16.49] vs. 6.67 [95% CI: 5.32, 7.10] months, respectively). 
Efficacy according to pre-specified subgroups favoured the nivo+ipi treatment arm in most of them. 
Particularly, improvement in  OS in  the non-epithelioid histology should be remarked, as this subgroup of  
patients is known for its chemo-resistance associated to limited responses to standard first line 
treatment. Results however numerically favoured chemotherapy arm in some subgroups such as ≥75 
years, stage I-II and subjects with prior radiotherapy. In line with what previously said, epithelioid 
histology obtained worse comparative  results HR=0.86 (0.69, 1.08) but, this is due to its documented 
better response to chemotherapy, and it is not considered enough to exclude these patients, as the 
results are still positive for the combination. 
Regarding elderly patients (≥75 years) the findings in this study are in line with those reported in other 
studies with this combination. Although median OS results numerically favour the nivo+ipi combination, 
the HR for OS is 1.02 and the secondary endpoints showed better results for the chemotherapy arm, 
which is in line with the observations made for the ITT population. This analysis is not powered to reach 
any conclusion so results should be interpreted with caution and this information is included in the PI 
(section 5.1). 
ORR results for predefined subsets, same as PFS, generally concurs with the overall results, but benefit 
for some of them seems to specially favour chemotherapy treatment. This is observed for North America 
and Asia region and PD-L1 expression <1%. Also, for sarcomatoid histology, quite higher ORR was 
reported for nivo+ipi (54.3% vs 25.0%). Once again, small sample size for these subsets and the lack of 
stratification factors among them precludes any firm conclusion. 
The role of PD-L1 as a biomarker in MPM is not established, with recent studies failing to demonstrate the 
predictive value of PD-L1 expression to select patients who will most benefit from anti-PD-(L)1 therapy 
regimens. Efficacy by PD-L1 tumour cell expression was assessed as a secondary endpoint but it was not 
a stratification factor and efficacy results in these subgroups come from exploratory  analyses and the 
study is therefore not powered to assess treatment effect by PD-L1 expression. Analyses were planned 
and performed to explore possible associations between efficacy endpoints and various levels of PD-L1 
expression, according to the SAP. Even more, there were some imbalances between treatment arms, i.e. 
among subjects with quantifiable PD-L1 test at baseline, 80.3% of subjects in the nivo+ipi arm had 
tumour positive PD-L1 expression (≥1%), while only 19.7% had tumour negative PD-L1 expression 
(<1%), compared to 73.7% and 26.3% in the chemotherapy arm, respectively. Imbalances are also seen

EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 113/164 
 
 
 
 
in several key baseline characteristics. Efficacy according to PD-L1 expression was explored in the PD-L1 
evaluable population which represented 96.9% of the All Randomized population. OS in subjects with ≥ 
1% baseline PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 positive) was consistent with the results seen in the All 
Randomized population. The improvement in OS with nivo+ipi treatment over chemotherapy was larger 
in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours (HR for < 1% and ≥ 1% PD-L1 was 0.94 and 0.69, respectively. 
However,  the absence of stratification by PD-L1 expression, the smaller sample size of the <1% PD-L1 
subgroup (compared with ≥ 1% PD-L1 subgroup), and the variability of chemotherapy performance 
(median OS of 16.5 and 13.3 months for chemotherapy subjects with PD-L1 negative and positive 
tumours, respectively), also may have contributed to the difference in performance. 
Nevertheless, even if efficacy in patients with PD-L1 expression <1% appears more limited, [OS HR=0.94 
(95% CI: 0.62, 1.40), median OS was 17.28 (10.09, 24.34) months for the nivo+ipi arm and 16.49 
(13.37, 20.53) months for the chemotherapy treatment arm] and, as expected, neither PFS nor ORR 
results supports the small reported increase in median OS [PFS HR=1.79 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.64), median 
PFS of 4.14 (95% CI: 2.69, 5.59) months for the combination group and 8.31 (7.00, 11.07) months for 
the chemotherapy group; ORR (95% CI) in PD-L1 negative patients was 21.1% (11.4, 33.9) for the 
nivo+ipi arm and 38.5% (27.7, 50.2) for the chemotherapy arm; DOR for PD-L1 <1% responders not 
reported] and some caution is needed in interpreting these more ‘negative’ results , evidence is not 
considered strong enough to exclude PD-L1 <1% patients from the indication. Detailed data have 
however been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC to inform treating physicians. 
In CA209743, PD-L1 expression was reported at a higher frequency in the non-epithelioid subgroup 
compared with the epithelioid subgroup in both the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms.  This is consistent 
with observations from other studies showing that sarcomatoid/biphasic subtypes are more commonly 
PD-L1 expressors than the epithelioid subtype.  
The magnitude of OS benefit comparing nivo+ipi vs chemotherapy did vary according to histology and 
PD-L1 expression. Given the correlation between histology subtype and PD-L1 expression an efficacy 
subgroup analysis by histology and PD-L1 was performed. 
Results of the analysis (Table 27), show a survival benefit favouring nivo+ipi regardless of PD-L1 
expression in the non-epithelioid cohort (PD-L1 ≥ 1%, HR = 0.43 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.66] and PD-L1 < 1%, 
HR = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.67], respectively). In the epithelioid group, the benefit with nivo+ipi vs 
chemotherapy was more pronounced in PD-L1 ≥ 1% (HR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.06]) vs PD-L1 < 1% 
(HR = 0.99 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.56]). Results of other efficacy endpoints in these subgroups were consistent 
with the all randomized population. However, it should be noted that the subgroup sample sizes are small, 
defined by both histology and PD-L1 simultaneously, and therefore some estimates of benefit, particularly 
in the lower  PD-L1 expressing group of epithelioid subjects, remain imprecise. 
In the nivo+ipi arm,  28 subjects (9.3%) discontinued ipilimumab  early. Out of the 28 subjects, 64.3% 
discontinued ipilimumab due to adverse event and 35.7% discontinued for “other” reasons. Patients who 
discontinued ipilimumab received a median of 4.5 (range 1-48) nivolumab doses (after stopping 
ipilimumab).  The wide range shows high variability in the response and tolerability to nivolumab after 
ipilimumab was stopped.  The MAH was asked to analyse the endpoints separately for patients receiving 
more nivolumab infusions, in order to explore the role of nivolumab in maintaining a response achieved 
with the combination. The limit was set at 4 additional nivolumab doses (similar to the median observed), 
after ipilimumab discontinuation. As expected, efficacy endpoints results were better in subjects receiving 
at least 4 additional nivolumab doses, which seems to confirm the benefit of maintaining treatment in 
patients who discontinue ipilimumab  to prolong the response to treatment while controlling toxicity, 
known to be less with nivolumab monotherapy than with the combined treatment, although the 
recommendation is still continuous combination treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Supportive study – contribution of monocomponents 
The results from the investigator-sponsored study MAPS2 were submitted to support the relative 
contribution of ipilimumab to nivolumab in the treatment of malignant MPM since study CA209743 did not 
include a comparator  arm with nivolumab or ipilimumab  monotherapy to show the additional benefit of 
the proposed combination strategy. In that supportive trial the addition of ipilimumab  to nivolumab 
translated into improvement  of ORR,  PFS and OS, compared with nivolumab monotherapy. Also, a 
previous trial with a CTLA4 inhibitor (tremelimumab) failed to show superiority over placebo in the second 
line mesothelioma which suggests that anti CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies, like ipilimumab, might not be 
effective as monotherapy in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The proposed approach to 
address the contribution of monocomponents has obvious limitations, as it is based on cross study 
comparisons and data coming from a different line of therapy, however, it can be regarded as basically 
acceptable also considering that a gain in OS has been reported with the proposed combination therapy 
vs. current standard of care (reference is made to EMEA/H/C/WS1278). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions  on the clinical efficacy 
Data supporting this variation procedure are based on the results from Study CA209743, a phase III, 
open-label study, in which 605 MPM untreated patients were randomized to receive 
nivolumab+ipilimumab combination until progression or unacceptable toxicity or standard treatment with 
platinum-based chemotherapy for 6 cycles. Subjects were stratified by histology (epithelioid or 
non-epithelioid) and gender, known prognostic factors for MPM. The primary  objective was to evaluate 
survival in this population and the primary endpoint was OS. The control arm is considered adequate, as 
platinum in combination with pemetrexed is established as the standard 1L treatment for MPM in all 
clinical guidelines.  
The combination therapy showed an overall clinically relevant improvement  in the ITT in OS of 4.0 
months [HR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.89), stratified log-rank test p value=0.0020]. Median OS was 18.07 
(95% CI: 16.82, 21.45) months and 14.09 (95% CI: 12.45, 16.23) months for nivo+ipi and 
chemotherapy, respectively. On the contrary, no improvement was observed for PFS and ORR, although 
some durable responses were identified, similar to what has been observed with immunotherapy 
treatment in other tumour types. This combination also showed an improved OS for both histologies 
included, which is remarkable  for non-epithelioid MPM, traditionally associated to poor responses to 
chemotherapy. Indeed in non-epithelioid patients (n=133) the reported improvement  in OS was larger 
compared to that reported in epithelioid patients (n=471), i.e. median OS of 8.80 (95% CI: 7.62, 11.76) 
months and of 16.23 (95% CI: 14.09, 19.15) months for the chemotherapy arm vs. 16.89 (95% CI: 
11.83, 25.20) months and 18.73 (95% CI: 17.05, 21.72) for the nivo+ipi combination arm  [HR = 0.46 
(95% CI: 0.31, 0.70) vs. HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.06)], respectively. 
2.5.  Clinical  safety 
Introduction 
Primary safety data are from the pivotal Study CA209743, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study of 
nivo+ipi versus chemotherapy (pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin) in subjects with previously 
untreated unresectable MPM. Supportive safety results are also provided from the Intergroupe 
Francophone de Cancérologie Thoracique (IFCT)-Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study 2 
(IFCT-1501 MAPS2) study, an investigator-sponsored trial, to provide safety and tolerability data on 
nivolumab monotherapy and the combination of nivo+ipi in MPM. In addition, the frequency of adverse

events (AEs), immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs), and other events of special interest (OESIs) from nivo+ipi 
in CA209743 are assessed relative to those from nivo+ipi regimens studied in other tumour types: 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) study CA209227 Part 1 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg 
Q6W), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) study CA209214 and colorectal cancer (CRC) study CA209142 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W in 
both RCC and CRC studies). 
The safety data are presented for nivo+ipi (N = 300) and chemotherapy (N = 284) treated subjects from 
the pivotal study CA209743. These data are based on the database lock (DBL) of 03-Apr-2020, with a 
minimum follow-up of 22.1 months for overall survival (OS). The safety analyses were conducted in all 
584 treated subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. 
Patient  exposure 
Based on the database lock of 03-Apr-2020, 584 subjects were treated (300 subjects in the nivo+ipi arm 
and 284 in the chemotherapy arm). The median duration of therapy was 5.55 months for the nivo+ipi 
arm and 3.48 months for the chemotherapy arm.

Out of the 189 chemotherapy-treated subjects with reason off treatment “not reported”, 176 (93.1%) 
subjects did receive all 6 cycles (the maximum allowed duration of chemotherapy per protocol). The CRF 
did not have an option for treatment completion as reason for end of treatment.  
A higher proportion of subjects in the nivo+ipi arm  than in the chemotherapy arm discontinued study 
therapy due to study drug toxicity (19.7% vs 8.5%). These data should be evaluated taking into 
consideration the planned treatment duration for each regimen. 36 (61.0%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm 
discontinued due to study drug toxicity after 3 months of treatment vs. 6 (25.0%) subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm (mDOT among those who discontinued due to study drug toxicity in nivo+ipi arm was 
4.37 months [0.95, 9.95 interquartile range (IQR)] vs. 2.45 months [2.09, 2.99 IQR] in chemotherapy 
arm),  although 22.0% of subjects in the nivo+ipi arm discontinued after 12 months of treatment.   
Discontinuation due to study drug toxicity did not seem to impact overall survival based on an exploratory 
post-hoc analysis. In subjects who discontinued due to study drug toxicity, median OS was 24.64 (95% 
CI: 17.08, N.A.)  months and 9.79 (95% CI: 7.72, 20.99) months for nivo+ipi and chemotherapy, 
respectively (HR = 0.47 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.81]). However, since the two regimens had different treatment 
duration, subjects in the nivo+ipi arm could discontinue later than subjects in the chemotherapy arm, and 
therefore, the mOS for these subjects could be artificially longer. 
Ten subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and 2 subjects in the chemotherapy arm discontinued due to maximu m 
clinical benefit which was defined by the Investigator. Of the 10 subjects in nivo+ipi arm, 9 subjects were 
discontinued for PR and 1 subject was discontinued for SD. The maximum number of cycles on nivo+ipi 
could be 18 (6 week/cycle over 2 years), and 4 subjects have received 2 years of treatment. Of the 2 
subjects in the chemotherapy arm, both received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with a best response of SD. 
Patient exposure 
The maximum duration of treatment per protocol  was 24 months for nivo+ipi, and 6 cycles of 
chemotherapy. A total of 300 subjects received at least 1 infusion of nivo+ipi, and 284 subjects received 
at least 1 infusion of chemotherapy. In this study, the proportion of subjects who received ≥ 90% of the 
planned dose intensity was as follows in each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo+ipi: 69.0% for nivolumab, 83.6% for ipilimumab   
•  Chemotherapy: 65.5% for pemetrexed, 77.9% for cisplatin, and 64.6% for carboplatin 
The median number of doses received was as follows in each arm: 
•  Nivo+ipi: 12.0 doses for nivolumab, 4.0 doses for ipilimumab 
•  Chemotherapy: 6.0 doses for pemetrexed, 5.0 doses for cisplatin, and 6.0 doses for carboplatin  
The median (95% CI) duration of therapy was 5.55 (4.63, 6.70) months for the nivo+ipi arm and 3.48 
(N.A, N.A.)  months for the chemotherapy arm.

Partial discontinuation 
Subjects treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab  could discontinue ipilimumab  and continue to receive 
nivolumab (i.e. partial discontinuation); however, if nivolumab was discontinued, ipilimumab could not be 
continued alone as monotherapy. 
In the nivo+ipi arm,  28 subjects (9.3%) discontinued ipilimumab  early. Out of the 28 subjects, 64.3% 
discontinued ipilimumab due to adverse event and 35.7% discontinued for “other” reasons. Following 
ipilimumab discontinuation, subjects continued receiving nivolumab monotherapy for a median of 112.5 
days (range 13-750 days). 
Dose Delay, Dose Reductions, Infusion Interruptions and Infusion Rate Reductions of Study 
Therapy 
Most treated subjects received all doses of study medication without infusion interruptions or infusion 
rate reductions; however, dose delays were common in both arms.   
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose delay) were reported as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi: 55.0% for nivolumab and 44.3% for ipilimumab 
•  Chemotherapy: 29 - 39% of subjects experienced a delay in chemotherapy (pemetrexed, cisplatin, 
and/or carboplatin)  
The primary reason for nivolumab delay was due to adverse events (55.2%); for ipilimumab, the primary 
reason was “not reported”, which included adjustment of dosing schedule to resynchronize ipilimumab 
with nivolumab dosing (54.5%). The primary reason for dose delay in the chemotherapy arm was due to 
adverse events (68.6% pemetrexed, 58.5% cisplatin, 67.3% carboplatin).   
Omitted Doses: Dose omissions were not permitted for nivolumab and ipilimumab. In the chemotherapy 
arm,  2 subjects missed 1 dose of pemetrexed and 1 dose of carboplatin due to adverse events.  
Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab or ipilimumab treatment, but they were permitted  
with chemotherapy. Dose reductions of chemotherapy (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose 
reduction) were reported as follows: 
•  Chemotherapy: 31.3% for pemetrexed, 17.3% for cisplatin, and 40.7% for carboplatin  
Infusion interruptions: 6.7% and 1.3% of subjects had at least one infusion interruption during 
nivolumab or ipilimumab  administration, respectively. Out of the nivolumab interruptions, 60.7% of 
occurrences were due to hypersensitivity reaction. For ipilimumab,  the main reason for the few 
interruptions (4 occurrences) was due to “other” reasons (75.0%). 
In the chemotherapy arm,  infusion interruptions occurred infrequently during pemetrexed (0.4%) and 
carboplatin (1.4%) administration. 9.6% of subjects who received cisplatin experienced an infusion 
interruption, due to “other” reasons.  
Infusion rate reductions: 9.0% and 2.3% of subjects required a reduction in nivolumab or ipilimumab 
infusion rate, respectively. When nivolumab or ipilimumab  IV infusion rates were reduced, the primary 
reason was “other” (79.8% and 50.0%, respectively). 
In the chemotherapy arm,  few subjects required an infusion rate reduction. The highest incidence 
occurred with carboplatin (7.7%), mainly due to “other” reasons. 
Switch from cisplatin to carboplatin: In the chemotherapy arm, 29 subjects switched from cisplatin 
to carboplatin at some point in the study.

Adverse events 
Safety data are presented for nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg IV Q6W and of 
pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy (Table 53). The nivo+ipi regimen was 
administered for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or toxicity, whereas 
chemotherapy was limited to 6 cycles. The median duration of therapy and follow-up were longer in 
nivo+ipi arm than in chemotherapy arm.

MedDRA version 22.1; CTC version 4.0. Includes events reported between first dose and 30 days after the last dose of study drug, unless otherwise 
indicated. 
Abbreviations: AEs - adverse events, DC - discontinuation, OESIs - other events of special interest, SAEs  - serious adverse events 
Common Adverse Events 
The overall frequencies of any-grade all causality AEs and drug-related AEs were similar  between the 
nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms; the overall frequencies of Grade 3-4 all causality AEs were higher with  
nivo+ipi compared with chemotherapy (Table 53). 
All-causality Adverse Events 
Any-grade all-causality AEs were reported in 299 (99.7%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm, and 277 
(97.5%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm (Table 53 and Table 54). 
The most frequently reported AEs (regardless of causality) were:  
•  Nivo+ipi: diarrhoea (31.3%), fatigue (28.7%), dyspnoea (26.0%), nausea (24.3%), and decreased 
appetite (23.7%). 
•  Chemotherapy: nausea (43.3%), anaemia (41.9%), constipation (29.6%), neutropenia (27.8%), 
fatigue (27.1%), and decreased appetite (25.4%).

Exposure adjusted AE incidence rates: When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, AE incidence rates 
(per 100 person-years) were 1485.0 with nivo+ipi treatment and 2306.4 with chemotherapy treatment. 
Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs were reported in 159 (53.0%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm, and 121 
(42.6%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm.   
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) were: 
•  Nivo+ipi: increased lipase (5.3%), diarrhoea (4.0%), fatigue, increased amylase, and malignant 
neoplasm progression (3.0%, each) 
•  Chemotherapy: neutropenia (15.8%), anaemia (13.7%), asthenia (4.2%), thrombocytopenia 
(3.9%), and dyspnoea (3.2%) 
Drug-related Adverse Events  
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 240 (80.0%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm,  and 233 
(82.0%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm (Table 31).   
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were: 
•  Nivo+ipi: diarrhoea (20.7%), pruritus (16.3%), rash (14.3%), fatigue (13.7%), and hypothyroidism 
(10.7%). 
•  Chemotherapy: nausea (36.6%), anaemia (35.9%), neutropenia (25.0%), fatigue (19.4%), 
decreased appetite (17.6%), and asthenia (15.5%).   
Exposure adjusted AE incidence rates: When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, drug-related AE 
incidence rates (per 100 person-years) were 502.1 with nivo+ipi treatment and 1355.3 with 
chemotherapy treatment. 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 91 (30.3%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm, and 91 (32.0%) 
subjects in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were: 
•  Nivo+ipi: increased lipase (4.3%), diarrhoea (3.3%), colitis (2.3%), and increased amylase (2.3%).  
•  Chemotherapy: neutropenia (15.1%), anaemia (11.3%), asthenia (4.2%), thrombocytopenia 
(3.5%), and nausea (2.5%).

Adverse Events by Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ)  
The number of subjects in CA209743 with at least 1 AE per individual SMQ occurring up to 30 days after 
last dose was analyzed by treatment arm using both broad scope and narrow scope SMQs. Results of 
these analyses did not lead to the identification of new types of clinically important events (data not 
shown)

Serious Adverse Events 
The overall frequencies of SAEs (all-causality and drug-related) were higher in the nivo+ipi arm than in 
the chemotherapy arm (Table 53). 
A higher frequency of drug-related SAEs with nivo+ipi relative to chemotherapy were reported in the 
following SOCs: GI disorders (5.3% vs 1.4%), hepatobiliary disorders (3.7% vs 0%), renal and urinary 
disorders (3.0% vs 0%), endocrine disorders (2.7% vs 0%), respiratory disorders (2.3% vs 0%), and 
injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2.0% vs 0%).   
Any-grade all-causality SAEs were reported in 164 (54.7%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm vs 72 
(25.4%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm.  Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 103 (34.3%) subjects in 
the nivo+ipi arm  and 54 (19.0%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm (Table 57). 
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs were: 
•  Nivo+ipi: malignant neoplasm progression (10.7%), pyrexia (4.3%), pneumonia (3.7%), pleural 
effusion (3.0%), and colitis (3.0%). 
•  Chemotherapy: malignant neoplasm progression (4.6%), anaemia (2.8%), and dyspnoea (2.1%). 
Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 64 (21.3%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm,  and 22 
(7.7%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported in 46 (15.3%) 
subjects in the nivo+ipi arm, and 17 (6.0%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were: 
•  Nivo+ipi: colitis (3.0%), infusion related reaction (2.0%), abnormal hepatic function, acute kidney 
injury, and pneumonitis (1.7%, each).   
•  Chemotherapy: anaemia (2.1%), febrile neutropenia (1.1%), and pancytopenia (1.1%).

Table 57 - Most Frequently Reported (in ≥ 2%) Serious Adverse Events - All Treated Subjects      
Exposure-adjusted Adverse Events Rates 
The overall frequencies of all-causality and drug-related SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were 
higher with nivo+ipi than with chemotherapy. However, when incidence rates were exposure-adjusted 
(analyses accounting for multiple occurrences of adverse events and total exposure time to study 
treatment in each arm), the overall rates of all-causality and drug-related SAEs in the nivo+ipi arm were 
comparable  to the incidence rates in the chemotherapy arm (Table 58). In contrast, the exposure 
adjusted incidence rates of all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were higher in 
the chemotherapy arm relative to the nivo+ipi arm (Table 58).

Select Adverse Events  
The majority of select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories (any grade) were as follows in each 
treatment arm  (Table 53): 
•  Nivo+ipi: skin (36.0%), gastrointestinal (22.0%), hepatic and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction 
(12.0% each) 
•  Chemotherapy: skin (9.9%), gastrointestinal (8.1%), renal (6.7%) 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by preferred term (any grade) were as follows in 
each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo+ipi: diarrhoea (20.7%), pruritus (16.3%), rash (14.3%), hypothyroidism (10.7%), and infusion 
related reaction (8.0%) 
•  Chemotherapy: diarrhoea (7.4%), rash (5.3%), blood creatinine increased (4.9%), erythema 
(1.8%), and hypersensitivity (1.8%) 
The most frequently reported drug-related serious select AEs by PT (any grade) were as follows in each 
treatment arm:  
•  Nivo+ipi: colitis (3.0%), infusion related reaction (2.0%), pneumonitis (1.7%), and acute kidney 
injury (1.7%) 
•  Chemotherapy: diarrhoea (0.4%) 
Across the select AE categories, the majority of events in the nivo+ipi arm were manageable using the 
established algorithms, with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mainly 
systemic corticosteroids) were administered (Table 59). Except for endocrine events, most drug-related 
select AEs with nivo+ipi had resolved (ranging from 66.4% to 94.4% across categories) at the time of 
database lock. Some endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for 
hormone replacement therapy.

Immune-mediated Adverse Events  
IMAE analyses included events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose (ie, 
with extended follow-up). These analyses occurred on subjects who received immune-modulating 
medication for treatment of the event, with the exception of endocrine events, which were included in the 
analysis regardless of treatment since these events are often managed without immunosuppression. In 
addition, these events were identified by the investigator as IMAEs with no clear alternate etiology and an 
immune mediated component.  
Overall, the majority of IMAEs were Grade 1-2 (Table 53). The most frequently reported IMAEs (any 
grade) were as follows in each treatment arm (Table 54). 
•  Nivo+ipi: rash (13.0%), hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (11.7%), diarrhoea/colitis (8.7%), and 
pneumonitis (6.7%) 
•  Chemotherapy: rash (1.1%) 
Across IMAE categories, the majority  of events were manageable using the established management 
algorithms, with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mostly systemic 
corticosteroids) were administered (Table 60). Some endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due 
to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy (Table 60).  
Re-challenge information was also summarized for subjects who continued to receive nivolumab 
treatment after the onset of an IMAE (Table 60). A re-challenge was considered as an unsuccessful or 
positive re-challenge if, after resolution of the IMAE, a new IMAE of the same type occurred with 
re-treatment. A re-challenge was considered as a successful or negative re-challenge if, after resolution 
of the IMAE, no new IMAEs of the same type occurred with re-treatment.

Other Events of Special Interest 
Other events of special interest (OESIs) (regardless of causality or IMM treatment) with extended 
follow-up are summarized by category in Table 53.  
OESIs (regardless of causality or IMM treatment, with extended follow-up) were infrequent in both 
treatment arms (Table 53). Overall, OESIs were reported in 14 (4.7%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and 
1 (0.4%) subject in the chemotherapy arm. 
12/14 OESIs in the nivo+ipi arm  and 1/1 OESIs in the chemotherapy arm  were resolved at the time of 
database lock. 12/14 and 1/1 events had resolved with IMM treatment in the nivo+ipi and chemotherapy 
arms,  respectively.  
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)  
For labeling purposes, some MedDRA PTs were re-mapped or deleted. Re-mapping allowed for pooling of 
PTs representing the same or similar clinical conditions. Some MedDRA PTs were deleted from the tables 
Assessment report

generated to support the product information because they were overly general/non-specific. The 
summary table of AEs with re-mapped MedDRA PTs was used to identify ADRs for both the USPI and the 
SmPC.

Laboratory  findings 
Laboratory results that were recorded regardless of causality and reported after first dose and within 30 
days of last dose of study therapy are presented in the sections below for all subjects treated with 
nivo+ipi or chemotherapy in CA209743.  
Haematology 
Abnormalities in hematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were 
as follows: 
•  Nivo+ipi: absolute lymphocyte count (8.1% Grade 3) 
•  Chemotherapy: hemoglobin (14.5% Grade 3), absolute lymphocyte count (13.4% Grade 3), and ANC 
(8.0% Grade 3) 
On-treatment worsening of hematology parameters to Grade 3-4 was higher in the chemotherapy arm vs 
nivo+ipi arm (Table 61).

Liver Tests 
Generally, there was a higher frequency of AST and ALT elevations in the nivo+ipi arm relative to the 
chemotherapy arm.  Most on-treatment liver tests were Grade 1-2.  
A total of 3/295 (1.0%) and 4/295 (1.4%) subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and no subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm had concurrent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) > 3 ×  ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN within 1 day and within 30 days based on laboratory 
results reported after the first dose and within 30 days of last dose of study therapy (Table 62 [SI]).

Kidney Function Tests 
Most subjects with at least 1 on-treatment measurement had normal creatinine values during the 
treatment reporting period. 
The abnormalities in creatinine (increase) were primarily  reported as Grade 1 or 2. 1 subject in the 
nivo+ipi arm and 1 subject in the chemotherapy arm had a Grade 3-4 increased creatinine level.

The majority of subjects did not have creatinine that worsened relative to baseline. The proportions of 
subjects with creatinine level worsening to Grade 3-4 relative to baseline were 0.3% and 0.4% in the 
nivo+ipi and chemotherapy arms, respectively. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
Generally, there was a higher frequency of abnormal  thyroid function test results in the nivo+ipi arm 
relative to the chemotherapy arm. Increases in TSH (>ULN) from baseline (≤ULN) were reported in 
26.4% subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and 7.5% subjects in the chemotherapy arm. Decreases in TSH (< 
LLN) from baseline (≥LLN) were reported in 20.3% subjects in the nivo+ipi arm and 2.0% subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm (Table 64).

Pancreas Function Tests 
Amylase and lipase were assessed periodically during treatment and within 30 days of last dose. Most 
abnormalities were Grade 1-2. Grade 3-4 abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of treated subjects with 
on-treatment laboratory results were Grade 3 lipase (8.4%) in the nivo+ipi arm. 
The majority of subjects did not have on-treatment worsening (increases) in amylase or lipase. The 
proportions of subjects with amylase and lipase worsened to Grade 3-4 relative to baseline were higher in 
the nivo+ipi arm  than in the chemotherapy arm: 
Nivo+ipi: lipase (12.8%) and amylase (5.4%)  
Chemotherapy: lipase (0.8%) and amylase (0.9%)  
Electrolytes 
Most subjects had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period. Abnormalities  in 
electrolytes during treatment were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity. The following Grade 3 abnormalities 
in electrolytes were observed in ≥ 5% of treated subjects with on-treatment laboratory results: 
•  Nivo+ipi: hyponatremia (8.8% Grade 3) 
Chemotherapy: none

Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: 
Nivo+  ipi (range: 109 to 297 subjects); chemotherapy (range: 90 to 278 subjects). 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivo+ipi arm for the subgroup of gender were 
similar to the AE frequencies reported for the overall study populations by treatment. For subgroups 
based on race, most participants were clustered in a single category (White). Very low sample sizes in 
other categories of race limit the interpretability  of potential differences.  
For subgroups based on age, no overall difference in AEs (all-causality) was reported in older subjects (≥ 
65 and < 75, ≥ 75 and < 85, and ≥ 85 years) compared with younger subjects (< 65 years) treated with 
nivo+ipi; however, the frequency of drug-related AEs was higher in the older subjects (71.8%, 83.4%, 
80.0%, and 100.0% in subjects aged < 65, ≥ 65 and < 75, ≥ 75 and < 85, and ≥ 85 years, respectively). 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs (excluding progression terms) was higher in subjects aged 75 
years or older, relative to all patients who received nivo+ipi (34.6% vs 27.7%).  
For subgroups based on geographic region, the Asia region had the highest frequency of drug-related 
Grade 3-4 AEs compared to the other regions (Asia [50.0%], Europe [29.7%], Rest of World [26.9%], 
and North America  [25.0%]).

The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the chemotherapy arm for the subgroup of gender 
were similar to the AE frequencies reported for the overall study populations by treatment. The following 
numerical differences were observed in the subgroups of age and geographical region within the 
chemotherapy treatment group: 
• 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were higher in older subjects: 
−  All-causality Grade 3-4 AEs: 32.2%, 43.9%, 50.7%, and 100.0% in subjects aged < 65, ≥ 65 and 
< 75, ≥ 75 and < 85, and ≥ 85 years, respectively 
−  Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs: 25.3%, 30.1%, 40.8%, and 100.0% in subjects aged < 65, ≥ 65 and 
< 75, ≥ 75 and < 85, and ≥ 85 years, respectively 
−  The rate of discontinuation due to AEs (excluding progression terms) was higher in subjects aged 
75 years or older who received chemotherapy, relative to all patients (25.7% vs 19.4%). 
• 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were highest in the Asia region:  
−  All-causality Grade 3-4 AEs: Asia (52.6%), Europe (42.1%), Rest of Word (40.4%), and North 
America (36.0%).  
−  Drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs: Asia (39.5%), Europe (32.9%), North America (28.0%), and Rest of 
Word (26.3%). 
These differences do not alter the overall safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab  in these subgroups.  
Special Population - Age Groups 
In CA209743, the frequencies of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-level 
Group Term  (HLGT)/SMQs/SOC by age group are presented for nivo+ipi and chemotherapy treated 
subjects in Table 66.  
In CA209743, only a small number of subjects were aged > 85 years (N =3 in both nivo+ipi and 
chemotherapy arms).  
The frequencies for subgroups of age < 65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years were similar to the frequencies 
reported for the overall study population by treatment, with these exceptions: 
Nivo+ipi: 
−  Numerically higher frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years of age 
subgroup vs the overall population for SAEs - total (65.3% vs 54.7%) and SAEs requiring 
hospitalization/prolongation (62.7% vs 50.7).

Immunogenicity  - CA209743 
Of the 269 nivolumab ADA evaluable subjects in the nivo+ipi arm, 17 (6.3%) subjects were nivolumab 
ADA positive at baseline and 69 (25.7%) subjects were nivolumab ADA positive after the start of 
treatment (Table 67). Few subjects were persistent positive (1.9%) and positive for neutralizing ADA 
(0.7%). The highest titer value recorded was 64 which occurred in one subject.  
Of the 271 ipilimumab ADA evaluable subjects nivo+ipi arm, 12 (4.4%) subjects were ipilimumab ADA 
positive at baseline and 37 (13.7%) subjects were ipilimumab ADA positive after start of treatment (Table 
45). Few subjects were persistent positive (1.1%) and positive for neutralizing ADA (0.4%). The highest 
titer value recorded was 32 which occurred in one subject.

Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety 
The frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions was 10.1% and 12.0% in nivolumab ADA positive 
and ADA negative subjects, respectively. Similarly,  the frequency was 10.8% and 12.0% in ipilimumab 
ADA positive and ADA negative subjects, respectively (Table 68). These findings suggest that neither 
nivolumab nor ipilimumab  ADA occurrence has impact on subject safety.

Safety Results - MAPS2 Study in MPM 
In the MAPS2 study, subjects were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or nivo+ipi at the same 
schedule and regimen as that used in CA209743 (Table 69). The duration of the study treatment was 2 
years from randomization, until disease progression, occurrence of any adverse event (AE) requiring 
discontinuation, or withdrawal of consent.  
The population in the MAPS2 study was subjects diagnosed with unresectable MPM and previously treated 
by at least one line of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.

Study  Design 
Phase 2, multi-center, randomized open-label study. 
Subjects were  randomized 1:1 into two arms, using  minimization method, and assigned to one of the following 
treatment arms:  
•  Monotherapy arm: Nivolumab was administrated intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg Q2W  
• 
Combination arm: Nivolumab was administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg Q2W,  combined with 
ipilimumab administered IV over 90 minutes at 1 mg/kg Q6W.   
Randomization was stratified by: 
1)  histology: epithelioid vs sarcomatoid and biphasic  
previous line  of treatment (2nd line  vs 3rd line of treatment) 
chemosensitivity (progression  >3 months vs progression ≤ 3 months)  
Study  Population 
Subjects (≥ 18 years) with h istologically  proven diagnosis of unresectable MPM. Subjects received prev ious treatment 
with 1 or 2 systemic chemotherapy lines (1 line  of chemotherapy considered if the patient received ≥2 cycles of this 
chemotherapy), including at least one line with pemetrexed in combination with platinum agent and had documented 
progression  of the MPM, assessed by CT scan.

According to the MAH, the routine clinical and laboratory evaluations performed in the study were 
appropriate  and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the 
recommendations from the 1974 Declaration of Helsinki (revised in 1975 and 1989), public health law no. 
2004-806 of 09-Aug-2004 related to the protection and safety of humans, and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) requirements [International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6]. 
The toxicity was monitored at each visit for AEs according to the CTCAE v4.0. and evaluated as the 
number and the percentage of subjects with at least 1 AE per arm and per grade.  
AEs were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification version 
21.0. 
Overall Adverse Events  
The safety analysis was performed on the safety population that included all recruited subjects who 
received at least one dose of the study drug. 
All subjects (63 in the nivolumab arm and 61 in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm) experienced at least 
one AE (all-causality). Twenty-five (39.7%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 36 (59%) subjects in the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  had at least one SAE (all-causality). AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation (all-causality) were reported in 3 (4.8%) and 14 (23%) subjects in the nivolumab and 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm,  respectively. All-causality Grade 3/4 AEs were experienced in 30 
(47.6%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 32 (52.5%) subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm, 
and all-causality Grade 5 AEs in 7 (11.1%) and 5 (8.2%) subjects, respectively.  
A total of 57 (90.5%) subjects in the nivolumab arm  and 57 (93.4%) subjects in the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  arm experienced at least one treatment-related AE (any grade). The most common 
treatment-related AEs (>10%) included asthenia [27 (42.9%) and 34 (55.7%) subjects], diarrhoea [9 
(14.3%) and 18 (29.5%) subjects] and nausea [11 (17.5%) and 11 (18%) subjects] in the nivolumab 
and nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arms, respectively.

subjects; grade 4: 1 (1.6%) subject] than in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  [grade 3: 15 (24.6%) 
subjects; grade 4: 2 (3.3%) subjects].  
The safety profiles of nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab arms seemed consistent with other trials 
using immunotherapies and even more favorable compared to the safety profiles associated to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The summary of AEs is provided in Table 70.

Grade 5 treatment-related AEs, were reported in 3 (4.9%) subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm 
only, including one patient with hepatitis, one patient with encephalitis and one patient with acute kidney 
failure.  
The 3 deaths considered treatment related in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  were reported during 
the first 4 months. However,  no additional treatment-related deaths were reported for the next 20 
months. This could be related to the experience that investigators gained in identifying immune-related 
AEs and optimizing the treatment for the patients, throughout the study. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Twenty-five (39.7%) subjects in the nivolumab arm  and 36 (59%) subjects in the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  arm had at least one SAE (all-causality).

In total, 123 SAEs (all-causality) have been reported to IFCT, including 56 SAEs in the nivolumab arm, 65 
SAEs in the nivolumab plus ipilimu mab arm and 2 SAEs reported before the beginning of the treatment.   
Among these events, 29 SAEs were defined as possibly related to the study treatment, including 4 SAEs 
in the nivolumab arm and 25 SAEs in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. Most of the treatment-related 
SAEs observed during the study were expected, except for 3 suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs), including one atrioventricular block, one encephalitis and one bullous pemphigoid, 
which were all reported in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm. 
Safety Results of Nivolumab  + Ipilimumab  in First-line  MPM and Other 
Tumour  Types 
Safety data of nivo+ipi from CA209743 in first-line MPM subjects are presented side-by-side with safety 
data of nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg from first-line NSCLC study CA209227 Part 1, RCC 
study CA209214, and CRC study CA209142. While all studies had a ipilimumab  dose of 1 mg/kg, 
ipilimumab was administered less frequently in the MPM study than in the RCC and CRC studies (Q6W vs 
Q3W), but over a longer duration (up to 2 years vs for 4 doses).  
The intended dose and schedule of nivolumab + ipilimumab  were as follows: 
•  MPM (CA209743): nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W 
•  NSCLC (CA209227 Part 1): nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W 
•  RCC (CA209214): nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W 
•  CRC (CA209142): nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W 
The DBL dates and minimum follow-ups of these studies are as follows: 
•  MPM (CA209743): 03-Apr-2020, with a minimum follow-up of 22.1 months for OS and median 
follow-up of 17.35 months for all other data  
•  NSCLC (CA209227 Part 1): 02-Jul-2019, with a minimum follow-up of 29.3 months for OS and 28.3 
months for all other data 
•  RCC (CA209214): 07-Aug-2017, with a minimum follow-up of 17.5 months 
•  CRC (CA209142): 18-Aug-2017, with a minimum follow-up of 9 months  
Overall, the safety profile of nivo+ipi in first-line MPM (CA209743) was consistent with the safety profile 
of the nivo+ipi in first-line NSCLC (CA209227 Part 1), RCC (CA209214), and CRC (CA209142) (Table 71). 
It should be noted that there were differences in follow-up across 4 studies. 
•  No new safety concerns were identified with nivo+ipi in CA209743 MPM, relative to nivo+ipi in 
CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC. 
•  Death attributed to study drug toxicity was rare with nivo+ipi across tumour types.  
•  All-causality and drug-related SAEs, all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, 
and all-causality AEs were reported at similar frequencies with nivo+ipi in CA209743 MPM relative to 
CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC. 
•  Drug-related AEs (any-grade and Grade 3-4) were reported at similar frequencies with nivo+ipi in 
CA209743 MPM relative to CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC.

• 
IMAEs were reported at similar  or lower frequencies with nivo+ipi in CA209743 MPM relative to 
nivo+ipi in CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC in most IMAE categories.  
•  Most drug-related select AEs were reported at lower or similar frequencies with nivo+ipi in CA209743 
MPM relative to nivo+ipi in CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC in most select AE 
categories. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions select AEs occurred at a higher frequency in 
CA209743 MPM than in CA209227 NSCLC (12.0% vs 4.0%), CA209214 RCC (12.0% vs 4.0%), and 
CA209142 CRC (12.0% vs 3.4%). 
•  OESIs (regardless of causality or immune-modulating medication) within 100 days after the last dose 
were reported at lower or similar  frequencies with nivo+ipi in CA209743 MPM relative to nivo+ipi in 
CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC.

Post marketing  experience 
Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Worldwide Patient 
Safety, review of post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the nivolumab + ipilimumab 
clinical trial safety data. The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab  in the post-marketing setting 
remains favourable. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nivolumab 360 mg administered every 3 weeks in combination with 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab  administered every 6 weeks is based mainly on the pivotal study CA209743, a Phase 3, 
randomized, open label study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab  versus chemotherapy in subjects with 
previously untreated unresectable MPM. However, the posology used in this study differed from the one 
proposed to be included in the SmPC for the applied indication. In the CA209743 study subjects were 
randomized to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab  1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (N = 
300) or pemetrexed 500mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin (AUC of 5 mg per millilitre  per 
minute), on day 1 of a 21-days cycle for 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N 
= 284). Therefore, this section should be read in conjunction with the PK/PD section.  
Supportive safety results are also provided from the Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie 
Thoracique (IFCT)-Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study 2 (IFCT-1501 MAPS2), an 
investigator-sponsored trial,  to provide safety and tolerability data on nivolumab monotherapy and the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab  in MPM. 
The study CA209743 was comprised by patients with previously untreated MPM with a median age of 69 
years (range: 25, 89). Most of them were white (85.3%), male (77.2%), with an ECOG performance 
status of 0 (40.0%) or 1 (59.8%). Most of the patients had PD-L1 ≥ 1% (80%) and epithelioid histology 
(75%). Patients with primitive peritoneal, pericardial, testis, or tunica vaginalis mesothelioma, interstitial 
lung disease, active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, 
and brain metastasis (unless surgically resected or treated with stereotactic radiotherapy and no 
evolution within 3 months prior to inclusion in the study) were excluded from the trial. 
Safety data from study CA209743 are based on the database lock of 03-Apr-2020. The study stopped for 
superiority of OS at the planned interim analysis after crossing the boundary for statistical significance. 
From the 605 subjects who were randomized, the safety analyses were conducted in 584 treated subjects 
(300 subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm and 284 in the chemotherapy arm) who received at 
least one dose of study drug. 
At the time of database lock, 99.1% of patients did not continue in the treatment period. The main reason 
for not continuing in the treatment period other than disease progression was study drug toxicity (19.7% 
and 8.5% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and chemotherapy, respectively). The maximum duration of 
treatment per protocol was 24 months for nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The 
median (95% CI) duration of therapy was 5.55 (4.63, 6.70) months for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 144/164 
 
 
 
 
arm with a median number of doses of 12 for nivolumab and 4 for ipilimumab.  The median (95% CI) 
duration of therapy was 3.48 (N.A, N.A.)  months for the chemotherapy arm with a median number of 
doses of 6 for pemetrexed, 5 for cisplatin, and 6 for carboplatin. The proportion of patients who received 
at least 90% of the planned dose intensity were 68.7% for nivolumab, 82.3% for ipilimumab, 65.5% for 
pemetrexed, 70.2% for cisplatin, and 59.8% for carboplatin.   
There was a minimum follow-up (date of the last subject randomized to clinical data cut-off) of 22.1 
months for overall survival and a median follow-up for survival (median for all randomized subjects 
between the date of randomization to the clinical cut-off date) of 29.7 months.  
It is relevant to mention that the different figures between the safety profiles of nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  versus chemotherapy can be related to a longer treatment duration of the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  administration. However,  this more  prolonged treatment is required to obtain the observed 
efficacy results. Therefore, the unadjusted data is considered the main piece of information for the safety 
assessment.  
The overall frequencies of any-grade all causality AEs (> 95%) and drug-related AEs (≥80.0%) were 
similar between the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and chemotherapy arms. Frequencies of grade 3-4 
all-causality AEs were higher with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  (53.0%) compared to chemotherapy 
(42.6%), although frequencies of drug-related grade 3-4 AEs were similar between the 2 arms (30.3% 
and 32.0% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and chemotherapy, respectively).  
The most frequently reported all-causality AEs in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  were diarrhoea 
(31.3%), fatigue (28.7%), dyspnoea (26.0%), nausea (24.3%), and decreased appetite (23.7%). Whilst 
those in the chemotherapy arm were nausea (43.3%), anaemia (41.9%), constipation (29.6%), 
neutropenia (27.8%), fatigue (27.1%), and decreased appetite (25.4%). The most frequently reported 
grade 3-4 all-causality AEs in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm were increased lipase (5.3%), diarrhoea 
(4.0%), fatigue, increased amylase, and malignant neoplasm progression (3.0%, each). Whilst in the 
chemotherapy arm were neutropenia (15.8%), anaemia (13.7%), asthenia (4.2%), thrombocytopenia 
(3.9%), and dyspnoea (3.2%). 
The overall frequency of all-causality SAEs and drug-related SAEs was higher with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab (54.7% | 21.3%) compared to chemotherapy (25.4% | 7.7%). Grade 3-4 all causality SAEs 
were also more frequent for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm (34.3%) compared to the chemotherapy 
arm (19.0%). In the same way, the frequency of grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs was higher in the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  (15.3%) compare to the chemotherapy arm  (6.0%).  
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm were malignant 
neoplasm progression (10.7%), pyrexia (4.3%), pneumonia (3.7%), pleural effusion (3.0%), and colitis 
(3.0%). Whilst those in the chemotherapy were malignant neoplasm progression (4.6%), anemia 
(2.8%), and dyspnoea (2.1%). The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related SAEs in the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  were colitis (3.0%), infusion related reaction (2.0%), abnormal hepatic 
function, acute kidney injury, and pneumonitis (1.7%, each). Whilst for chemotherapy, were anaemia 
(2.1%), febrile neutropenia (1.1%), and pancytopenia (1.1%).  
A higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm  than in the chemotherapy arm 
presented any-grade all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation (29.3% vs. 20.4%), grade 3-4 
all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation (19.7% vs. 9.9%), any-grade drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation (23.0% vs 15.8%) and grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (15.0% vs. 
7.4%). 
The most frequently reported any-grade all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation in the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab arm were colitis (2.3%), diarrhoea (2.3%), infusion related reaction (1.7%), and pneumonitis

(1.7%). Whilst in the chemotherapy arm were anaemia (3.9%), asthenia (2.1%), nausea, fatigue, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (1.8%, each). Most of these events were considered drug-related by 
the investigator.  
In the dataset of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in MPM (n = 300), with a 
minimum follow up of 22.1 months, the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were fatigue (43%), 
diarrhoea (31%), rash (30%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (24%), decreased appetite (24%), 
pruritus (21%), constipation (19%), and hypothyroidism (13%). The majority of adverse reactions were 
mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) (SmPC section 4.8). 
Select AEs, IMAEs and OESIs occurred more frequently with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  compared to 
chemotherapy.  
The majority of select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm 
were skin (36.0%), gastrointestinal (22.0%), hepatic and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction (12.0% 
each). Whilst in the chemotherapy arm were skin (9.9%), gastrointestinal (8.1%), renal (6.7%). The 
median time to resolution ranged from 0.14 to 12.14 weeks for select AEs. 
Occurrence of IMAEs in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm was as follows (% of subjects with  any grade 
IMAE | % of those subjects with grade 3-4 IMAE): rash (13.0% | 61.5%), hypothyroidism/thyroiditis 
(11.7% | 25.7%), diarrhoea/colitis (8.7% | 92.3%), and pneumonitis (6.7% | 65.0%). The majority of 
events were manageable, with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mostly 
systemic corticosteroids) were administered. Some endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due to 
the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. The proportion of patients with resolution of the 
above-mentioned IMAEs were 61.5%, 25.7%, 92.3%, and 65.0%, for rash, hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, 
diarrhoea/colitis, and pneumonitis, respectively. The median time to resolution ranged from 0.14 to 
17.14 weeks for IMAEs. 
OESIs were reported in 14 (4.7%) subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm and 1 (0.4%) subject 
in the chemotherapy arm. 8/14 OESIs in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm were grade 3-4 including 
events of pancreatitis, encephalitis, myositis, myasthenic syndrome, uveitis and myocarditis.    
With regards to laboratory  findings, there was a higher frequency of elevated AST/ALT  and abnormal 
increases or decreases in TSH  with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  treatment, and a higher frequency of 
hematologic abnormalities with chemotherapy. The proportions of subjects with amylase and lipase 
worsened to grade 3-4 relative to baseline were higher in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm than in the 
chemotherapy arm,  as well as the proportions  of subjects with laboratory and electrolyte abnormalities 
worsened to grade 3-4 relative to baseline.  
Three (1.0%) subjects in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm,  and 1 (0.4%) in the chemotherapy arm 
died due to study drug toxicity. Deaths in the nivolumab + ipilimumab  arm included one patient with 
pneumonitis, one patient with toxicity of immunotherapy and development of neurological complications, 
and one with acute heart failure. 
For subgroups based on age, the frequency of drug-related AEs was 71.8%, 83.4%, 80.0%, and 100.0% 
in subjects aged < 65, ≥ 65 and < 75, ≥ 75 and < 85, and ≥ 85 years, respectively. The rate of 
discontinuation due to AEs (excluding progression terms) was higher in subjects aged 75 years or older, 
relative to all patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab  (34.6% vs. 27.7%).  
In addition, numerically higher frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years of age 
subgroup vs. the overall population for SAEs (65.3% vs. 54.7%) and SAEs requiring 
hospitalization/prolongation (62.7% vs 50.7).

With regards to immunogenicity, 17/269 (6.3%) subjects were nivolumab ADA positive at baseline and 
25.7% were nivolumab ADA positive after the start of treatment. 1.9 % were persistent positive and 
0.7% were positive for neutralizing ADA. 12/271 (4.4%) subjects were ipilimumab  ADA positive at 
baseline and 13.7% were ipilimu mab ADA positive after start of treatment. 1.1% were persistent positive 
and 0.4% were positive for neutralizing ADA. No differences were found in the frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects for both, nivolumab 
and ipilimumab.   
In the IFCT-1501 MAPS2 study, subjects were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  at the same schedule, regimen, and treatment duration as that in CA209743. The study 
included subjects diagnosed with unresectable MPM and previously treated by at least one line of 
pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. The safety profiles of nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab arms 
seemed consistent with other trials.  
A cross-study comparison was also provided by the MAH with other tumour types in which the 
combination nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg was studied: Study CA209227 Part 1 in NSCLC 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus  ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W), study CA209214 in RCC (nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W), and CA209142 in CRC 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W). 
This comparison showed that all-causality and drug-related AEs, all-causality and drug-related SAEs, and 
all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported at similar frequencies with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in CA209743 MPM relative to CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and 
CA209142 CRC. IMAEs were reported at similar or lower frequencies with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in 
CA209743 MPM relative to nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and 
CA209142 CRC in most IMAE categories. Most drug-related select AEs were reported at lower or similar 
frequencies with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in CA209743 MPM relative to nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in 
CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC in most select AE categories. OESIs (regardless of 
causality or immune-modulating medication) within 100 days after the last dose were reported at lower 
or similar frequencies with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in CA209743 MPM relative to nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab  in CA209227 NSCLC, CA209214 RCC, and CA209142 CRC. Death attributed to study drug 
toxicity was rare with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  across tumour types.  
The most remarkable difference was related to the hypersensitivity/infusion reactions select AEs which 
occurred at a higher frequency in CA209743 MPM (12%) than in CA209227 NSCLC (4.0%), CA209214 
RCC (4.0%), and CA209142 CRC (3.4%).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions  on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination of nivolumab 360 mg administered every 3 weeks in combination 
with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered every 6 weeks is mainly based on the pivotal study CA209743, a 
Phase 3, randomized, open label study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab  versus chemotherapy in subjects 
with previously untreated unresectable MPM in which subjects were randomized to receive nivolumab 3 
mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (N = 300) or pemetrexed in combination  
with cisplatin or carboplatin (N = 284). Therefore, the combination regimen assessed through the study 
was different to the one proposed for the SmPC. See PK/PD section.  
The combination treatment appears to be less well tolerated than chemotherapy as grade 3-4 
all-causality AEs, all-causality and drug-related SAE (any-grade and grade 3-4), and all-causality and 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (any-grade and grade 3-4) were reported more frequently 
with the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  compared to chemotherapy. As expected, select AEs, IMAEs and 
OESIs also occurred more frequently with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  compared to chemotherapy. The 
Assessment report

Page 147/164 
 
 
 
 
safety profile of the combination is characterised by the immunological effects, compared to 
chemotherapy that is characterised by bone marrow  suppression. 
It is relevant to mention that the rate of discontinuation as well as the frequency of SAE and SAE requiring 
hospitalization/prolongation were higher in subjects aged 75 years and older compared to the overall 
population.  
A cross-study analysis compared the safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in the MPM study with 
previous studies of the combination. Overall, the safety profile of the combination of nivolumab 3mg/kg 
(Q2W) plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Q6W) in the first line treatment of subjects with unresectable MPM is in  
line with the known safety profile of the combination in other tumour types. The main difference found 
across them was related to hypersensitivity/infusion reactions which occurred at a higher frequency in 
CA209743 MPM compared to the rest of the studies which has been reflected by the MAH on the SmPC.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 6.6 of the SmPC  have been

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic  Context 
The proposed indication for the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab is for the ‘first line treatment of 
adult patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma’. 
The recommended dose is nivolumab 360 mg Q3W in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W up to 24 
months in patients without disease progression. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, locally invasive, and highly aggressive cancer of the 
pleural membrane. Patients with MPM usually have a very poor prognosis, and less than 10% of patients 
live beyond 5 years. Mesothelioma affects approximately  31,000 people around the world, with around 
30,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Occupational exposure to asbestos is the most important risk 
factor associated with MPM.  
MPM is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage due to late and non-specific symptoms. Thoracoscopy, or 
transparietal biopsies when thoracoscopy is contra-indicated, are the best methods for obtaining the 
diagnosis of MPM. Three major  histological subtypes of MPM are well described: epithelioid (most 
common), sarcomatoid, and mixed-type (biphasic), with the poorest prognosis in non-epithelioid 
subtypes.
Gender is also a known prognostic factor in MPM, with females typically having longer survival 
time than males. Measurement and evaluation of MPM based on imaging data is challenging given the lack 
of clearly demarcated margins of the lesions. The majority of newly diagnosed patients have unresectable 
MPM or are unsuitable candidates for surgery (i.e. age or medical comorbidities). 
3.1.2.  Available  therapies and unmet medical need 
For the past 15 years, standard of care (SOC) 1L chemotherapy for MPM has been a combination of 
pemetrexed and cisplatin, which has been shown to be more beneficial than cisplatin monotherapy. With  
this SOC, patients with MPM have a median overall survival (OS) of 12 months and a 5-year survival rate 
less than 10%. Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy also improves  the quality of life and relieves some 
symptoms,  such as dyspnoea. Although pemetrexed plus cisplatin is the SOC in 1L unresectable MPM, 
carboplatin is also recommended with pemetrexed, particularly in subjects who are unable to tolerate 
cisplatin. Based on published data in chemotherapy-naive subjects with MPM, clinical efficacy is similar 
between carboplatin and cisplatin-based regimens.  
Improvement  in 1L treatment has been observed by adding anti-angiogenic agents to 
platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy as shown by the Phase 2 Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie 
Thoracique (IFCT)-Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed Study (MAPS) with bevacizumab in 
selected patients. However,  this bevacizumab combination is not approved by health authorities.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 157/164 
 
 
 
 
 
After the first line, no treatment is approved for the second line treatment. The standard of care in the 
second line treatment consists of treatment with vinorelbine or gemcitabine or retreatment with 
pemetrexed.  
Currently various immunotherapy products (combinations) are under investigation in malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. A recent phase 2b study failed to show the superiority of an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal 
antibody (tremelimumab)  over placebo. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on data from study CA209743 which is a Phase 3, randomized (1:1), open-label, 
study evaluating nivo+ipi vs. chemotherapy as a 1L treatment in adults (18 years and older) with 
untreated, unresectable MPM. Randomization was stratified according to tumour histology: epithelioid vs. 
non-epithelioid (sarcomatoid or mixed histology subtypes), and gender (male vs. female). A tumour 
sample was required to be sent to the central laboratory for PD L1 status testing prior to randomization, 
but the results were not needed for randomization.  
Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W was administered with ipilimumab  1 mg/kg Q6W until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. For the control arm, pemetrexed 500 
2
mg/m
 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m
2
 or carboplatin (AUC of 5 mg per millilitre per minute) were administered 
on Day 1 of a 21-days cycle for 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
OS was the primary  endpoint. PFS, ORR (according to mRECIST or RECIST 1.1 criteria), DOR, DCR and 
PD-L1, as a predictive biomarker  for efficacy, were assessed as secondary endpoints. They were not 
formally tested. 
At database lock (DBL) (03-Apr-2020), the actual number of OS events was 419 (89% of total events 
planned). This corresponds to the first planned interim analysis for OS that was performed and the 
boundary for statistical significance for OS (p = 0.0345) was crossed (p = 0.0020). The study was then 
stopped for superiority of OS and the interim analysis considered the final primary  analysis result. 
3.2.  Favourable  effects 
The efficacy results of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  presented below are based on the 
database lock of 03 Apr 2020, with a median follow-up of 29.7 months. 
•  Nivo+ipi demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant improvement  in OS compared with 
chemotherapy: HR = 0.74 (Stratified Cox proportional  hazard model 96.6% CI HR: (0.60, 0.91); 
stratified log-rank test p value = 0.0020. Median OS was 18.1 (95% CI: 16.8, 21.5) months and 14.1 
(95% CI: 12.5, 16.2) months for nivo+ipi and chemotherapy, respectively. Nivo+ipi demonstrated an 
improvement in OS regardless of histology and the observed treatment effect was larger in subjects 
with non-epithelioid MPM, traditionally associated with poor responses to standard chemotherapy. In  
relation to PD-L1 expression, which was not a stratification factor, the improvement was larger in 
subjects with PD-L1 ≥1%.  
• 
The median PFS per BICR was 6.8 (95% CI: 5.6, 7.4) months in the nivo+ipi arm and 7.20 (95% CI: 
6.9, 8.1) months in the chemotherapy arm (HR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.21]). 
•  BICR assessed ORR was 40% (95% CI: 34.1, 45.4) in the nivo+ipi arm and 43% (95% CI: 37.1, 
48.5) in the chemotherapy arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 158/164 
 
 
 
 
• 
The median DoR was longer for confirmed responders in the nivo+ipi arm relative to confirmed 
responders in the chemotherapy arm (11.0 [95% CI: 8.1, 16.5] vs. 6.7 [95% CI: 5.3, 7.1] months, 
respectively). 
3.3.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  favourable effects 
Since study CA209743 did not include a comparator arm with nivolumab or ipilimumab monotherapy, the 
additive efficacy of ipilimumab  to nivolumab is substantiated primarily  on an improvement  in ORR,  with 
support from PFS and OS, observed for the combination over nivolumab in a phase 2 study in patients 
with 2L+ MPM, and on available evidence that anti CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies might not be effective as 
monotherapy in the treatment of MPM, i.e. based on cross-study comparisons (only). 
Efficacy assessment was based on radiological response by mRECIST or RECIST 1.1 criteria but they were 
updated by a protocol amendment when 68% of subjects had already been randomized which could have 
influenced the consistency of the efficacy results. The primary endpoint was not affected when presenting 
results for subjects randomized before and after the amendment, median OS and HR were similar in both  
cases. Some differences were expected for secondary endpoints as the amendment included a 
re-definition of the radiology assessment of these endpoints. Median PFS for both groups was not 
significantly changed before and after the revised protocol although, for the nivo+ipi arm, it was reduced 
from 6.97 to 5.59 months. The reported HR (95% CI) was 0.91 (0.69, 1.19) and 1.09 (0.82, 1.45), 
respectively. It is noted that the reported HR for the overall population was 1.00 (0.82, 1.21) and, as said, 
it did not support the PFS benefit, in fact, numerically favoured the chemotherapy arm vs. the nivo+ipi 
arm. The same discordance/trend was shown in the new data provided. Although the ORR was not highly 
affected by the revision, there was a remarkable  before/after difference for the DOR in the 
immunotherapy group: 14.59 vs. 8.18 months respectively. In the chemotherapy arm, the DOR was also 
reduced after the amendment (7.03 vs. 5.68 months) but the difference was not as worrying as in the 
nivo+ipi arm. The MAH clarified that the same criteria were applied during all the trial and that the 
amendment was only intended to adapt the protocol to the criteria already used by the BICR. Although 
some slight unbalances across arms before and after the amendment are observed that could have 
played a role (most likely differences in the distribution of patients by histology and PD-L1 expression), 
their contribution to the observed findings need to be very cautiously interpreted and no definitive 
conclusions can be drawn. Having said that, and although a level of uncertainty still remains, there 
appears to be no strong justification to question the reliability of radiologically assessed endpoints based 
on the differences found in the requested post-hoc analysis. In addition, it is considered that PFS, ORR 
and DOR results are of interest for prescribers and are therefore included in the PI, along with an explicit 
reference to their descriptive nature.  
The primary endpoint was changed during the study, as originally OS and PFS were co-primary. Also, the 
hierarchical testing of the secondary endpoints was removed and all results for these endpoints became 
descriptive. Due to the extensive nature of MPM, tumour measurements have always been challenging 
and the progression-free survival (PFS) endpoint is considered imprecise to evaluate clinical benefit. 
Benefit reported with this combination in OS does not match the results from PFS and ORR, where better 
results for chemotherapy arm were observed. Also, for OS, crossing of the KM curves is observed, 
probably  due to early deaths of non-responder subjects. This is in line with results from other 
immunotherapy studies. 
The observed median OS was comparable  in the epithelioid and non-epithelioid group. The 
non-epithelioid group are known for its chemoresistancy, indicating that the immunotherapy combination 
might be of particular advantage for this tumour type. Indeed, in this subgroup, the observed OS benefit 
was larger than in the epithelioid group. These subgroup results are included in the PI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/260350/2021 
Page 159/164 
 
 
 
 
Regarding OS results in predefined subsets, they generally concur with the overall results but some of 
them (≥75 y, stage I-II,  prior  radiotherapy, Asia region, PD-L1 expression <1%) seemed to favour the 
chemotherapy treatment. Once again, small sample size for these subsets and the lack of stratification 
factors among them precludes any firm conclusion. Benefit in elderly patients (≥75 years) is also unclear, 
as OS results did not evidently favour the combination and its toxicity should be included in the 
benefit/risk assessment for this population. This information is included in the PI. Further, efficacy results 
by tumour PD-L1 expression are also included in the PI to inform treating physicians. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of nivolumab 360 mg administered every 3 weeks in combination with 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab administered every 6 weeks is based on the pivotal study CA209743 (N=584). However, the 
posology used in this study differed from the one proposed to be included in the SmPC for unresectable 
MPM as subjects received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab  1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. 
The median (95% CI) duration of nivolumab plus ipilimumab administration was 5.55 (4.63, 6.70) with a 
median number of doses of 12 for nivolumab and 4 for ipilimumab.  The proportion  of subjects who 
received at least 90% of the planned dose intensity were 68.7% for nivolumab and 82.3% for ipilimumab. 
The frequency of any-grade all-causality AEs was above 95%. The most frequently reported (≥ 25%) 
all-causality AEs were diarrhoea (31.3%), fatigue (28.7%), dyspnoea (26.0%). Grade 3-4 all-causality 
AEs were reported in 53% of subjects, being the most frequent (≥5%) increased lipase (5.3%). 
The overall frequency of all-causality SAEs was 54.7%. The frequency of SAEs that were considered 
related to study treatment was 21.3%. The most frequently reported (≥5%) SAE was malignant 
neoplasm progression (10.7%).  
The frequency of any-grade and grade 3-4 of AEs leading to discontinuation was 29.3% and 19.7%, 
respectively. Most of them were considered treatment-related. The main AEs that lead to treatment 
discontinuation were colitis, diarrhoea, infusion related reactions, and pneumonitis (<2.5% each).  
The majority of select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  arm 
were skin (36.0%), gastrointestinal (22.0%), hepatic and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction (12.0% 
each). Compared to previous studies in different tumour types, a higher frequency of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions select AE was found in CA209743 (12% vs. ≤ 4%). In the dataset of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in MPM (n = 300), with a minimum follow-up 
of 22.1 months, the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were fatigue (43%), diarrhoea (31%), rash 
(30%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (24%), decreased appetite (24%), pruritus (21%), 
constipation (19%), and hypothyroidism (13%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate 
(Grade 1 or 2). This has been reflected in the SmPC.  
The most frequent (≥ 10%) IMAEs were rash (13%) and hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (11.7%). The 
majority of the events were resolved with the administration immune-modulating medications (mostly 
systemic corticosteroids) with a median time to resolution between 0.14 to 17.14 weeks. Some endocrine 
IMAEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.  
OESIs were reported in 4.7% subjects which included grade 3-4 events of pancreatitis, encephalitis, 
myositis, myasthenic syndrome, uveitis and myocarditis.    
Three (1.0%) subjects died due to study drug toxicity including one patient with pneumonitis, one patient 
with toxicity of immunotherapy and development of neurological complications, and one with acute heart 
failure.

With regards to laboratory  findings, increased ALT and AST worsened to grade 3-4 relative to baseline 
occurred in 7.1% of subjects, each. In addition, abnormal increases or decreases in TSH were found with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab  treatment.  
Finally, the rate of discontinuation due to AEs (excluding progression terms) was higher in subjects aged 
75 years or older, relative to all patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab (34.6% vs. 27.7%). In  
the same way, higher frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years of age subgroup 
vs. the overall population for SAEs (65.3% vs 54.7%) and SAEs requiring hospitalization/prolongation 
(62.7% vs 50.7). 
3.5.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  unfavourable effects 
The cross-study comparison found a higher frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions in CA209743 
compared to the studies CA209227 Part 1, CA209214, and CA209142. This has been reflected on the 
SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
Overall, the reported results of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the 1L treatment of MPM are 
considered relevant. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare disease with poor prognosis and usually 
diagnosed in advanced stages. Standard treatment, platinum+pemetrexed chemotherapy, was 
authorized in 2004 showing a survival benefit of 12 months, but no other treatment combination has 
showed better results thus far. 
This application is based on the results from a phase III randomized trial, in comparison with the SOC in 
this treatment line. Subjects were randomized by histology and gender, two widely known prognostic 
factors for this condition. Nivolumab + ipilimumab have showed a clinically relevant survival benefit of 4 
months. This was also observed for most of the predefined subgroups. The median OS was comparable 
between both histologies (epithelioid and non-epithelioid), with a larger improvement in the non- 
epithelioid group which has been associated with poor responses to chemotherapy. In relation to PD-L1 
expression, which was not a stratification factor, the improvement  in OS with nivo+ipi treatment over 
chemotherapy was larger in subjects with PD-L1 positive tumours. 
No improvement was shown for PFS and ORR with the nivolumab + ipilimumab  combination, compared 
with chemotherapy, but quite durable responses were reported for responders. This phenomenon has 
been previously observed in other immunotherapy studies but the question about what subgroups of 
patients may not benefit from this kind of treatment remains unclear at this time.

Regarding the contribution of monocomponents, the additive efficacy of ipilimumab  to nivolumab has 
sufficiently been shown in a qualitative manner based primarily on an improvement in ORR, with support 
from PFS and OS, observed for the combination over nivolumab, and on available evidence that anti 
CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies might not be effective as monotherapy in the treatment of MPM, even 
though based on cross-study comparisons (only). Further, the fact that an improvement in OS has been 
reported in study CA209743 with the proposed combination vs. current standard of care in the intended 
treatment setting substantially reduces the concerns (reference is made to EMEA/H/C/WS1278).    
From a safety point of view, the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  in the 
intended indication appears consistent with that previously observed in other indications and is in line 
with the already known safety profile of each component. The combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab is 
characterised by a high incidence of adverse events, especially those considered immunomediated. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Combination  treatment  with  nivolumab  and  ipilimumab,  in  comparison  with  chemotherapy  standard 
treatment, resulted in an OS benefit in the treatment of MPM which has a very poor prognosis. 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  the  combination  appears  to  be  similar  to  that  observed  with  the  same 
combination in other indications and seems in line with the safety profile of both components 
The benefit-risk balance is therefore considered positive in the target population as represented by the 
adopted indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional  considerations  on the benefit-risk balance 
The final adopted indication is: 
For OPDIVO: 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab  is indicated for the first line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
For YERVOY: 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of nivolumab + ipilimumab  in the claimed indication is positive.

Extension of indication to include first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM) for combination treatment of Opdivo and Yervoy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 (for both products) and 6.6 (for Opdivo) of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet 
is updated in accordance. Version 20.1 for Opdivo and version 30.1 for Yervoy of the RMP has also been 
adopted.  
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments  to the marketing  authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the worksharing procedure, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to 
the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

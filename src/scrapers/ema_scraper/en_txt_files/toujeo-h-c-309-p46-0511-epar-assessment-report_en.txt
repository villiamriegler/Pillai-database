1.  Updated Recommendation 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, the Rapporteur considers that the 
submitted documentation for Optisulin (insulin glargine), in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above, did not reveal any new or unexpected 
issues.  
No amendments to SmPC, labelling and/or Package Leaflet of Optisulin are warranted based on the 
review of the data on PD, PK and safety of Study EFC11681. There are no outstanding issues. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Optisulin (insulin glargine 100 U/mL injection) had been approved for the treatment of adults, 
adolescents, and children of 6 years and above with diabetes mellitus, where treatment with insulin 
is required since 2000 in United States (US) and 2003 in European Union (EU).  In 2012, EU 
expanded the indication to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) children aged 2 to 5 years old.  
In 2010, the MAH issued a clinical trial waiver application to China Food and Drug Administration 
(CFDA) for label update to be consistent with EU label. CFDA asked Sanofi to conduct a trial in 
paediatric patients. A Phase 3 clinical study, EFC11681, was thus conducted in Chinese children 
with T1DM aged at least 6 to less than 18 years to support the indication proposed in China. 
In accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Sanofi is hereby submitting the 
final Clinical Study Report (CSR) for Study EFC11681: A 24-week, randomized, open-label, parallel 
group, multicentre comparison of Lantus® (insulin glargine) given once daily versus Neutral 
Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged at least 6 years to 
less than 18 years. 
The MAH considers that in the context of this submission, no amendments to SmPC, labelling 
and/or Package Leaflet of Optisulin are warranted based on the review of the data on PD, PK and 
safety of EFC11681 Study. 
The study used as a basis for clinical data presented in this dossier was conducted in compliance 
with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as required by the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. 
The study also meet with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, standard operating 
procedures for clinical investigations and documentation of the Sponsor, applicable national laws 
and regulations and the ethical principles of the Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Clinical pharmacology aspects 
The company conducted a clinical study (EFC11681) to assess the clinical efficacy Lantus® (insulin 
glargine) in Chinese children with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged at least 6 years to less than 18 
years (see 2.3.  Clinical efficacy aspects). In this study the pharmacokinetics of Lantus® 
(insulin glargine) was evaluated in a subpopulation, to rule out accumulation tendency of insulin 
glargine after repeated dosing.  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
2.2.1.1 Study population

The plasma concentrations of insulin glargine, M1 and M2 were determined in a subset of 40 
patients (PK population) of 107 patients randomized to the Lantus treatment group (40/107, 37%). 
The company provided a description of the demographics of the whole study population  
(see 2.3.2.1.)  however no detailed information was provided on the demographics of the PK  
subpopulation.  
2.2.1.2 Pharmacokinetic sampling  
The PK samples were obtained following once daily repeated subcutaneous Lantus (insulin glargine) 
dosing to children with T1DM, aged of at least 6 years to less than 18 years. 
The PK samples were collected within a time interval of 9.5 to 16.5 hours following the previous 
evening injection of Lantus at Week 1, Week 2 or Week 4. Timing of meal time (bolus) insulin was 
not taken into consideration, because the bioanalytical assay for insulin glargine parent compound 
and its metabolites M1 and M2 is specific with no interference by other insulin analogues. 
2.2.1.3 Analyical methods  
Insulin glargine (parent compound) and insulin glargine metabolites M1 and M2 in plasma were 
determined using immunoaffinity extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.2 ng/mL for all 3 analytes. The 
bioanalytical report for the determination of insulin glargine parent compound and its metabolites 
M1 and M2 in plasma was provided. PK samples were collected between 13 febr 2012 and 27 jan 
2014 stored at -80°C, shipped and analysed between 24 april 2012 and 20 may 2014 at Sanofi-
Aventis Deutschland GmbH,R&D - SCP Disposition, Safety & Animal Research Operational Center 
Frankfurt, Germany.  
2.2.1.4. Statistical methods  
Descriptive statistics on plasma concentration data for insulin glargine parent compound and its 
metabolites M1 and M2 were provided. The statistical analysis included the calculation of the 
arithmetic means, ranges, evaluation of the interquartile ranges  Q1 : Q3 and variation. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Following once daily repeated subcutaneous Lantus (insulin glargine) dosing in a subset of 40 
patients, insulin glargine metabolite M1 was the principal circulating compound in plasma. Within a 
time interval of 9.5 to 16.5 hours following the previous evening injection mean plasma metabolite 
M1 concentrations were 0.855 ng/mL at Week 1, 0.760 ng/mL at Week 2, and 0.672 ng/mL at 
Week 4 (see table PK1). This indicates that no accumulation of M1 occurred after repeated dosing. 
Mean plasma concentrations of insulin glargine (parent compound) and insulin glargine metabolite 
M2 were below LLOQ.

To rule out accumulation tendency of insulin glargine after repeated dosing, the insulin glargine 
pharmacokinetic (PK) was evaluated in a subset of 40 children included in clinical study EFC11681. 
The company should provide detailed information on the demographics of the PK subpopulation to 
show that a representative subpopulation was selected.  
Based on the presented data can be concluded that no accumulation of insulin glargine or its 
metabolites M1 or M2 occurred after repeated dosing in the selected subpopulation. These findings 
are in line with previously reported results of other studies in the paediatric population.

2.3.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
Study EFC11681 was a 24-week, randomised, open-label, parallel group, multicentre comparison 
of Lantus® (insulin glargine) given once daily versus NPH insulin in Chinese children with type 1 
diabetes mellitus aged at least 6 years to less than 18 years. 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
2.3.1.1.  Objectives 
The primary objective of Study EFC11681 was to assess the efficacy of insulin glargine given once 
daily (QD, pm dosing) on glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels over a period of 24 weeks in 
children with T1DM aged at least 6 years to less than 18 years. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of insulin glargine compared to NPH insulin 
over 24 weeks on: 1) Percentage of patients reaching International Society of Paediatric and 
Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) recommended target of HbA1c <7.5%, 2) Fasting blood glucose 
(FBG), 3) Nocturnal blood glucose (BG), 4) 24-hour blood glucose profile based on 8-point self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) values, 5) Daily total insulin dose and basal insulin dose, 6) 
Rates of all hypoglycaemia (including both asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemia), 
symptomatic, asymptomatic, severe symptomatic, nocturnal, and nocturnal symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia. 
In addition, the safety and tolerability of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin based on the 
occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and anti-insulin and anti-glargine 
antibody development were assessed. 
To rule out accumulation tendency of insulin glargine after repeated dosing, the insulin glargine 
pharmacokinetic (PK) for all patients treated with insulin glargine in selected sites with 
approximately 45% of insulin glargine population (see 2.2. Clinical pharmacology aspects). 
2.3.1.2.  Study population 
The population to be studied comprised paediatric patients with T1DM, with an age ranging from 
6 years to less than 18 years. The patients had a diagnosis of T1DM for at least 1 year and an 
HbA1c at screening of <12% and ≥ 7%. 
2.3.1.3.  Study design 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive Lantus as basal insulin given at bedtime 
(20:00 to 22:00) QD, or NPH insulin dosed once daily at bedtime (20:00 to 22:00) or twice daily in 
the morning (before breakfast) and at bedtime (20:00 to 22:00), both given as basal plus bolus 
insulin regimen for 24 weeks. The study was conducted only in China. 
Randomization was stratified both by baseline age (<12 years, ≥12 years) and by screening HbA1c 
(<9%, ≥9%). 
Both Lantus and NPH insulin were individually titrated to achieve predefined glycaemic targets. 
2.3.1.4.  Endpoints 
Primary endpoint was the absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. 
Secondary endpoints were percentage of patients reaching ISPAD recommended target of HbA1c 
<7.5% at Week 24, FBG change from baseline to Week 24, Nocturnal BG change from baseline to 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/308852/2015

Week 24, change in 24-hour blood glucose profile based on 8-point SMBG values from baseline to 
Week 24, change in daily total insulin dose and basal insulin dose from baseline to Week 24. 
Post hoc analyses were performed for change in daily bolus insulin dose from baseline to Week 24, 
change in daily insulin (including daily total insulin, daily basal insulin, and daily bolus insulin) dose 
by body weight, percentage of patients with 7.5%≤HbA1c≤9% and HbA1c >9% at Week 24 
(according to the categorization of glycaemic control in Chinese Diabetes Society’s Guideline for the 
diagnosis and treatment of T1DM in China). 
The safety and tolerability of Lantus versus NPH insulin were assessed based on: rates of all 
hypoglycaemia (including both asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemia), symptomatic, 
asymptomatic, severe symptomatic, nocturnal and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia during 
24-week treatment period, the occurrence of TEAEs, other safety assessments, including 
laboratories, vital signs, height and weight, and physical examination findings. 
Anti-insulin glargine antibody (AGA) and anti-insulin antibody (AIA) status and titre were assessed 
at screening, Week 4, and Week 24. 
2.3.1.5.  Statistical methods 
The study was aimed to document the efficacy and safety for the use of Lantus (insulin glargine) or 
NPH but not to test a specific hypothesis. 
2.3.1.5.1.  Analysis Population 
The primary efficacy population was modified Intention To Treat (mITT) population, which included 
all randomized patients who receive at least one injection of the investigational medicinal product 
IMP () and have both baseline and at least one post-baseline value of any endpoint, irrespective of 
compliance with the study protocol and procedures. 
2.3.1.5.2.  Primary Analysis 
As a continuous efficacy parameter, the primary endpoint, absolute change of HbA1c from baseline 
to Week 24, was analysed using descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum and maximum). For efficacy analysis, the baseline was defined as the last 
available value prior to the first dose injection of open-label IMP (Lantus or NPH insulin). In case of 
discontinuation of study drug before Week 24, HbA1c was to be assessed at the time of 
discontinuation. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) procedure was to be used by taking 
this last available post-baseline on-treatment HbA1c measurement as the HbA1c value at Week 24. 
2.3.1.5.3.  Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Missing efficacy endpoint values for all the efficacy variables were imputed from the last available 
on-treatment value using the LOCF method. 
Descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) was provided by 
treatment for all continuous secondary endpoints using the mITT population. 
Categorical secondary endpoints (eg, percentage of patients reaching ISPAD-recommended goals 
of HbA1c <7.5% at the end-of-treatment visit and the incidence rate of hypoglycaemia) were 
demonstrated by treatment.  
Similarly, for the post hoc analyses, change in daily bolus insulin dose and change in daily insulin 
dose by body weight were analysed using the descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/308852/2015

minimum, and maximum), and percentages of patients with 7.5%≤HbA1c≤9% and HbA1c >9% at 
Week 24 were demonstrated by treatment. 
2.3.1.5.4.  Analyses of safety data 
The safety analysis was conducted on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients 
who did actually receive at least one dose or partial of a dose of study drug analysed according to 
the treatment actually received. 
The event rate of hypoglycaemia was defined as the total number of episodes divided by the total 
duration from the first dose of IMP up to 24 hours after the last dose of IMP. 
The incidence rate of hypoglycaemia was defined as the total number of patients with at least one 
episode from the first dose of IMP up to 24 hours after the last dose of IMP divided by the total 
number of patients in the safety population.  
The on-treatment period for other safety variables was defined as the time from the first dose of 
IMP up to 7 days after the last dose of IMP administration. The TEAEs were defined as adverse 
events that developed or worsened (according to the investigator’s opinion) or became serious 
during the on-treatment period. 
2.3.1.5.5.  Analysis of antibody variables 
The analyses of antibody data were performed based on the antibody population, defined as all 
randomized patients who contributed at least one valid blood sample at screening, or Week 4, or 
Week 24 (the end of treatment) for AGA and AIA assessment.  
Percentage of patients with AGA and AIA positive and negative status was summarized by visit for 
each treatment group. The percent conversions from negative to positive and positive to negative 
of AGA and AIA status from screening to 4 weeks and from screening to 24 weeks were 
summarized by treatment group. 
AGA and AIA titers, as well as respective percent changes from baseline, each at nominal sampling 
times were listed and summarized by visit and treatment using descriptive statistics by N, mean, 
SD, geometric mean, coefficient of variation, standard error mean (SEM), median, minimum, and 
maximum. 
2.3.2.  Results 
2.3.2.1.  Disposition of subjects, demographic data and baseline characteristics 
A total of 196 patients were screened, and 162 patients were randomized to insulin glargine 
treatment group (Lantus) or NPH insulin treatment group (NPH) in a 2:1 ratio from IVRS database. 
Out of 196 patients, 31 (15.8%) were screen failures and 3 (1.5%) patients were run-in failures. 
The main reason for screen failures was the exclusion criterion E02 (HbA1c at screening <7% or 
>12%), which was accountable for 27 patients. 
Amongst the 162 randomized patients, 107 patients were randomized to Lantus group and 
55 patients to NPH group. One patient in the NPH group withdrew consent before receiving any 
study medication. Thus, 107 patients were treated with Lantus and 54 with NPH insulin. 
A total of 156 patients, 106 in the Lantus group and 50 in the NPH group, completed the 24-week 
treatment. During the treatment period, 1 patient (0.9%) in the Lantus group prematurely 
discontinued the study treatment and 4 (7.3%) in the NPH group. The patient in the Lantus group 
withdrew because of poor compliance to protocol. In the NPH group three patients (5.5%) also

Note: Percentages are calculated using the number of randomized patients as denominator.  
All patients in the study were Chinese. The demographic and baseline disease characteristics of 
randomized population were presented in Table 2. Randomization was stratified by age and 
baseline HbA1c level. The mean age of the study population was 12.3 years and 39.8% of the 
patients were <12 years. At baseline, 44.1% patients had HbA1c values <9% and 55.9% patients 
had HbA1c values ≥9%. There were more female patients (60.9%) than male (39.1%); however, 
the gender distribution was similar between the 2 groups. Baseline body weight and height were 
balanced between groups. The mean baseline body weight was 42.3 kg (42.8 and 41.3 kg in the 
Lantus and NPH groups, respectively). Tanner puberty stage distribution was similar between the 2 
groups. Overall, 42 (26.1%) patients were preadolescents (Tanner Stage 1) and the others (119 
patients, 73.9%) were adolescents (Tanner Stage 2 to 5). 
The mean duration of diabetes was 3.83 years in the Lantus group and 3.55 years in the NPH 
group (Table 8). Only one (1.9%) patient in the NPH group reported any diabetic complication 
(microalbuminuria). 
The mean HbA1c was 8.87% in the Lantus group and 9.12% in NPH. Other baseline efficacy 
variables were similar between the two treatment groups (Table 3).

Results for HbA1c are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1.  
From baseline to the end of study (Week 24 [LOCF]), mean and median changes in HbA1c 
were -0.25% and -0.50%, respectively, in the Lantus group, and -0.54% and -0.40%, respectively, 
in the NPH group. 
After 24 weeks Lantus and NPH groups reached similar level of glycaemic control (Lantus: 8.63%; 
NPH: 8.59%). Of note, Lantus group presented with a low baseline HbA1c in comparison to NPH 
group.

2.3.2.2.2.  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The percentage of patients reaching ISPAD target of HbA1c <7.5% at Week 24 in the Lantus group 
was 18.7% (20/107), in the NPH group 21.6% (11/51). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 52.3% 
(56/107) of the patients in the Lantus group and 51.0% (26/51) of the patients in the NPH group 
had an HbA1c 7.5%≤HbA1c≤9%, while 29% (31/107) of the patients in the Lantus group and 
27.4% (14/51) of the patients in the NPH group had an HbA1c >9%. 
At Week 24 (LOCF), mean FBG decreased from baseline (0.76 mmol/L) in the Lantus group while 
increased (1.07 mmol/L) in the NPH group.  
In Lantus group, the nocturnal blood glucose (measured at 3:00 AM of SMBG) had remained stable 
throughout the study, whereas NPH was noted to be fluctuating.  
In Lantus group, the 8-point SMBG appeared less fluctuating throughout the day as compared to 
NPH group.  
From baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), the mean daily total insulin dose was increased by 6.22 U to 
41.69 U in the Lantus group and by 11.51 U to 47.49 U in the NPH group. 
Additional analysis on the changes in daily total insulin dose by weight was done after database 
lock. From baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), the mean daily total insulin dose by weight was increased 
by 0.072 U/kg to 0.907 U/kg in the Lantus group and by 0.189 U/kg to 1.064 U/kg in the NPH 
group. 
From baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), the mean daily basal insulin dose was increased by 2.03 U to 
14.37 U for Lantus and by 6.10 IU to 19.02 IU for NPH. Additional analysis on the changes in daily

basal insulin dose by weight showed that the mean daily basal insulin dose was increased by 0.024 
U/kg to 0.312 U/kg for Lantus and by 0.112 IU/kg to 0.427 IU/kg for NPH. 
Additional analyses on changes in daily bolus insulin dose and changes in daily bolus insulin 
dose by weight were done after database lock. From baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), the mean daily 
bolus insulin dose was increased by 4.07 U (0.05 U/kg) to 27.37 U (0.60 U/kg) in the Lantus group 
and by 4.75 U (0.06 U/kg) to 28.47 U (0.64 U/kg) in the NPH group.

In summary, Lantus was effective as basal insulin in the basal + bolus treatment regimen in 
Chinese patients with T1DM aged at least 6 years to less than 18 years. Both Lantus and NPH 
insulin improved the glucose control as measured by HbA1c change from baseline to Week 24 and 
reached similar HbA1c level. In addition, Lantus also provided satisfactory FBG reduction, and 
stable nocturnal BG and daily SMBG profiles. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
On request of the China Food and Drug Administration the MAH conducted a phase 3 clinical study 
in Chinese children with T1DM aged at least 6 to less than 18 years to support the indication 
proposed to China. In this study, Lantus once daily was compared to NPH insulin in effect on HbA1c 
after 24 weeks of treatment. Eligible patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner (Lantus:NPH), and 
randomisation was stratified both by baseline  age (<12 years, ≥12 years) and by screening HbA1c 
(<9%, ≥9%). 
The study was aimed to document the efficacy and safety for the use of Lantus (insulin glargine) or 
NPH but not to test a specific hypothesis. 
A total of 196 patients were screened, and 162 patients were randomised to insulin glargine 
treatment group (Lantus) or NPH insulin treatment group (NPH) in a 2:1 ratio. 
Demographic data and baseline characteristics were fairly similar between treatment groups. 
Baseline HbA1c was somewhat lower in the Lantus group (8.87 vs 9.12 respectively). After 24 
weeks HbA1c was decreased in both treatment groups. Mean decrease was lower in the Lantus 
group (-0.25 vs -0.54%) while median decrease was comparable (-0.50 v -0.40%). Final HbA1c 
was similar in both groups (8.63 vs 8.59%).  
Mean FBG decreased in the Lantus group (-0.76 mmol/L) while increased (1.07 mmol/L) in the NPH 
group from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF). The difference could be explained by the peak effect of 
NPH at around 4 to 6 h after injection, while Lantus offered a more stable level of blood glucose

control. Bedtime NPH insulin might not have been able to up titrate enough due to the concern of 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia events, and insufficient basal insulin supply possibly have led to the 
increase of FBG in the NPH group. In order to compensate this insufficient basal insulin supply, 
twice-daily NPH insulin or higher dose of bolus insulin could have been used. This is consistent with 
the finding that Lantus group had a lower dose increased in their mean daily basal, bolus, and total 
insulin as compared to NPH group, since the basal insulin dose titration mainly depended on the 
FBG. Similar results were also observed when the insulin doses were divided by body weight. 
From these results it can be concluded that Lantus is effective in this Chinese paediatric population. 
2.4.  Clinical safety aspects 
2.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety and tolerability of Lantus versus NPH insulin were assessed based on: rates of all 
hypoglycaemia (including both asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemia), symptomatic, 
asymptomatic, severe symptomatic, nocturnal and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia during 
24-week treatment period, the occurrence of TEAEs, other safety assessments, including 
laboratories, vital signs, height and weight, and physical examination findings. 
2.4.1.1.  Definitions of hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia was classified according to the following definitions: 
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia: Blood glucose values <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) without clinical 
• 
symptoms and/or signs validated by site based on data from patient diaries. 
Symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Any event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result 
• 
from a hypoglycaemic episode with an accompanying blood glucose <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) 
validated by site based on data from patient diaries.  
Severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Any event with clinical symptoms considered to result 
• 
from a hypoglycaemic episode for which the subjects required the assistance of a third party (ie, 
other than the patient or a parent/usual caregiver, eg, from emergency personnel) because the 
subjects/parents could not treat the event, with acute neurological impairment directly resulting 
from the hypoglycaemic event.  
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia: Any asymptomatic and/or symptomatic hypoglycaemic event that 
• 
occurred between 23:00 to 07:00 hours. 
Nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia: Any symptomatic hypoglycaemic event that occurred 
• 
between 23:00 to 07:00 hours. 
2.4.1.2.  Analysis 
The safety analysis was conducted on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients 
who did actually receive at least one dose or partial of a dose of study drug analysed according to 
the treatment actually received. 
The event rate of hypoglycaemia was defined as the total number of episodes divided by the total 
duration from the first dose of IMP up to 24 hours after the last dose of IMP. 
The incidence rate of hypoglycaemia was defined as the total number of patients with at least one 
episode from the first dose of IMP up to 24 hours after the last dose of IMP divided by the total 
number of patients in the safety population.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/308852/2015  
Page 13/21 
 
 
 
The on-treatment period for other safety variables was defined as the time from the first dose of 
IMP up to 7 days after the last dose of IMP administration. The TEAEs were defined as adverse 
events that developed or worsened (according to the investigator’s opinion) or became serious 
during the on-treatment period. 
Anti-insulin glargine antibody (AGA) and anti-insulin antibody (AIA) status and titre were assessed 
at screening, Week 4, and Week 24.  
2.4.2.  Results 
2.4.2.1.  Exposure 
Amongst the 162 randomized patients, 161 patients (99.4%) were exposed to the study treatment 
(107 on Lantus and 54 on NPH) and were evaluated for safety. 
The cumulative duration of treatment exposure was 49.1 patient years in the Lantus group and 
23.3 patient years in the NPH group. The mean duration of study treatment was 167.5 days for 
Lantus group and 157.6 days for NPH group. The majority of patients (106 [99.1%] patients in the 
Lantus group and 50 [92.6%] patients) had at least 141 days of treatment exposure. 
2.4.2.2.  Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia events were documented on a specific hypoglycaemia event form. They were 
summarized separately from TEAEs. 
Table 6 and Table 7 summarise the percentage of patients with hypoglycaemia (incidence rate) and 
the event rate of hypoglycaemia. 
Over the 24-week on-treatment period, 99 [92.5%] patients in the Lantus group and 51 [94.4%] 
patients in the NPH group experienced at least one episode of hypoglycaemia. The number of all 
hypoglycaemia events per patient year was 68.63 in the Lantus group and 84.58 in the NPH group.  
The number of patients and number of events per patient year for symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
was 74 (69.2%) patients with 24.27 events/PY in the Lantus group, and 41 (75.9%) patients with 
32.32 events/PY in the NPH group. 
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia was observed in 93 (86.9%) patients in the Lantus group and 47 
(87.0%) patients in the NPH group. The number of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia events per 
patient year was 44.36 in the Lantus group and 52.27 in the NPH group. 
The occurrence of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was rare in both groups. Over the 24-
week on-treatment period, 1 (0.9%) patient in the Lantus group and 1 (1.9%) patient in the NPH 
group each experienced one episode of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 83 (77.6%) patients in the Lantus group and 42 
(77.8%) patients in the NPH group. The number of symptomatic hypoglycaemia events per patient 
year was 12.97 in the Lantus group and 14.19 in the NPH group. 
Forty (40 [37.4%]) patients in the Lantus group and 25 (46.3%) patients in the NPH group 
experienced at least one episode of symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The number of 
nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia events per patient year was 3.58 in the Lantus group and 
4.52 in the NPH group.

patients in the Lantus group and 41 (75.9%) patients in the NPH group. The secondly most 
common TEAE by SOC was infections and infestations in both treatment groups, as reported by 47 
(43.9%) patients in the Lantus group and 27 (50.0%) patients in the NPH group. Common TEAE by 
preferred term (PT), as reported by more than 5% of the patients in any treatment group included 
hypoglycaemia (Lantus: 74 [69.2%] patients versus NPH: 41 [75.9%] patients), nasopharyngitis 
(Lantus: 28 [26.2%] patients versus NPH: 17 [31.5%] patients), upper respiratory tract infection

Treatment-emergent adverse events related to the IMP were reported in 37 (34.6%) patients in 
the Lantus group and 24 (44.4%) patients in the NPH group. The most common TEAE related to 
the IMP by PT was hypoglycaemia, as reported by 36 (33.6%) patients in the Lantus group and 22 
(40.7%) patients in the NPH group. Other TEAEs related to the IMP included overweight, which 
occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the Lantus group and 1 (1.9%) patient in the NPH group, and 
dizziness, hunger, injection site swelling, blood glucose increased, each occurring in 1 (1.9%) 
patient in the NPH group. 
A total of 9 patients reported 10 serious TEAEs, including 4 events in 3 (2.8%) patients in the 
Lantus group and 6 events in 6 (11.1%) patients in the NPH group. The most common serious 
TEAE by SOC was metabolism and nutrition disorders, including 5 events of diabetic ketoacidosis 
(reported by 2 [1.9%] patients in the Lantus group and 3 [5.6%] patients in the NPH group) and 
1 event of hypoglycaemia (1 [1.9%] patient in the NPH group). All patients recovered from the 
serious TEAEs after receiving corrective treatment. One serious TEAE was considered by the 
Investigators as related to study treatment and led to treatment discontinuation: 1 blood glucose 
increased in 1 patient on NPH. 
No death was observed in both treatment groups during the on-treatment period. 
Overall injection site and hypersensitivity reactions during the on-treatment period reported in the 
Lantus group was 1/107 (0.9%) versus 4/54 (7.4%) in the NPH group.

2.4.2.4.  Laboratory values, vital signs 
Descriptive statistics were provided for red blood cells and platelets, for white blood cells, for 
metabolic parameters, for electrolytes, for renal function, and for liver function. There were no 
relevant changes in mean values over time for any of the parameters in either treatment group. 
In addition, there were no relevant changes in mean values over time for blood pressure and heart 
rate in either treatment group. 
At Week 24, the mean body weight was 45.62 kg in the Lantus group and 43.58 kg in the NPH 
group. The weight gain from baseline was 3.05 kg in the Lantus group and 2.82 kg in the NPH 
group. 
2.4.2.5.  Anti-insulin glargine and anti-insulin antibodies 
At screening, 69.2% (74/107) and 60.7% (65/107) of the patients randomized to Lantus group 
were AGA and AIA positive, respectively, versus 78.2% (43/55) and 69.1% (38/55) of the patients 
in the NPH group (Table 9). From screening to Week 24, in the Lantus group the incidence of 
patients with positive AGA and AIA status decreased, both by 4.1%. In the NPH insulin group the 
number of AIA positive patients increased by 6.9% while the number of AGA positive patients 
remained at the screening level. Overall, the incidence of antibody positive patients was lower in 
the Lantus group compared to the NPH group at Week 24 (end of treatment). During the 24-week 
on-treatment period only small changes in AGA and AIA titres were observed for both treatment 
groups.

2.4.3.  Discussion 
No unexpected safety issues were detected. Both Lantus and NPH insulin were safe and well 
tolerated during the 24-week on-treatment period. There was a consistent trend of lower event 
rate in the Lantus group for all categories of hypoglycaemia. There were no relevant differences in 
TEAEs, laboratory values or vital signs. 
2.5.  Changes to the product information 
The MAH does not propose any changes to the product information. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk 
balance 
On request of the China Food and Drug Administration the MAH conducted a phase 3 clinical study 
in Chinese children with T1DM aged at least 6 to less than 18 years to support the indication 
proposed to China. In this study, Lantus once daily was compared to NPH insulin in effect on HbA1c 
after 24 weeks of treatment. Eligible patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner (Lantus:NPH), and 
randomisation was stratified both by baseline  age (<12 years, ≥12 years) and by screening HbA1c 
(<9%, ≥9%). 
The study was aimed to document the efficacy and safety for the use of Lantus (insulin glargine) or 
NPH but not to test a specific hypothesis. 
A total of 196 patients were screened, and 162 patients were randomised to insulin glargine 
treatment group (Lantus) or NPH insulin treatment group (NPH). 
Demographic data and baseline characteristics were fairly similar between treatment groups. 
Baseline HbA1c was somewhat lower in the Lantus group (8.87 vs 9.12 respectively). After 24 
weeks HbA1c was decreased in both treatment groups. Mean decrease was lower in the Lantus 
group (-0.25 vs -0.54%) while median decrease was comparable (-0.50 v -0.40%). Final HbA1c 
was similar in both groups (8.63 vs 8.59%). No detailed information on the demographics of the PK 
subpopulation was provided. This information should be submitted to show that a representative 
subpopulation was selected for the assessment of the pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Mean FBG decreased in the Lantus group (-0.76 mmol/L) while increased (1.07 mmol/L) in the NPH 
group from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF). The difference could be explained by the peak effect of 
NPH at around 4 to 6 h after injection, while Lantus offered a more stable level of blood glucose 
control. Bedtime NPH insulin might not have been able to up titrate enough due to the concern of 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia events, and insufficient basal insulin supply possibly have led to the 
increase of FBG in the NPH group. In order to compensate this insufficient basal insulin supply, 
twice-daily NPH insulin or higher dose of bolus insulin could have been used. This is consistent with 
the finding that Lantus group had a lower dose increased in their mean daily basal, bolus, and total

insulin as compared to NPH group, since the basal insulin dose titration mainly depended on the 
FBG. Similar results were also observed when the insulin doses were divided by body weight. 
Safety analysis did not reveal any new or unexpected issue. Both Lantus and NPH insulin were safe 
and well tolerated during the 24-week on-treatment period. There was a consistent trend of lower 
event rate in the Lantus group for all categories of hypoglycaemia. There were no relevant 
differences in TEAEs, laboratory values or vital signs.  
No accumulation of insulin glargine (parent compound) or insulin glargine metabolites M1 or M2 
was observed after repeated dosing of Lantus® in children. 
The MAH considers that in the context of this submission, no amendments to SmPC, labelling 
and/or Package Leaflet of Optisulin are warranted based on the review of the data on PD, PK and 
safety of EFC11681 Study. This can be endorsed. 
4.  Request for supplementary information 
4.1.  Major objection 
None. 
4.2.  Other concerns 
1.  The company should provide detailed information on the demographics of the PK subpopulation 
to show that a representative subpopulation was selected. 
5.  Rapporteur’s assessment of MAH responses to RSI 
Question  
The company should provide detailed information on the demographics of the PK subpopulation to 
show that a representative subpopulation was selected. 
Summary of the Applicant’s Response 
The PK population was defined as all randomized patients who were treated with Lantus and 
contributed at least the minimum required volume of plasma at Weeks 1, 2, and 4 and who had no 
major pharmacokinetic protocol violations. This subpopulation included 40 patients. 
The detailed information on the demographics of the PK subpopulation is provided below. 
SANOFI considers the PK subpopulation representative of the target pediatric population.

6.  Updated overall conclusion and impact on the benefit-
risk balance 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, the Rapporteur considers that the 
submitted documentation for Optisulin (insulin glargine), in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above, did not reveal any new or unexpected 
issues.  
No amendments to SmPC, labelling and/or Package Leaflet of Optisulin are warranted based on the 
review of the data on PD, PK and safety of Study EFC11681. There are no outstanding issues.

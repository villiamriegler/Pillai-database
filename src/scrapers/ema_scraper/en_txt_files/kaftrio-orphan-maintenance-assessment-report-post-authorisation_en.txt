questions  
COMP opinion (adoption via written 
26 March 2021 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing ivacaftor, N-(1,3-
dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonyl)-6-[3-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2,2-dimethylpropoxy)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-2-
[(4S)-2,2,4-trimethylpyrrolidin-1-yl]pyridine-3-carboxamide, tezacaftor was considered justified 
based on preliminary clinical data showing improvement of lung function with the proposed product 
in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation and in patients heterozygous for F508del and a 
minimal function mutation; 
• 
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing ivacaftor, N-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonyl)-6-[3-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2,2-
dimethylpropoxy)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-2-[(4S)-2,2,4-trimethylpyrrolidin-1-yl]pyridine-3-carboxamide, 
tezacaftor will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided 
preliminary clinical data that demonstrate that in the homozygous F508del patient population the 
proposed product has better effect on lung function than the combination of tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor, the CFTR modulators currently authorised for this patient population. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the 
condition. 
2.2.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
The COMP opinion on the initial review of the orphan medicinal product designation in July 2020 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000042077 
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Kaftrio may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition is confirmed. In patients homozygous for the F508del mutation of 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), Kaftrio showed better efficacy in the 
primary endpoint of lung function and in relevant secondary endpoints as compared to Symkevi, 
currently authorised for the condition. Kaftrio also showed clinical efficacy in patients heterozygous 
for F508del and minimal function mutations in the CFTR, for whom there is no specific CFTR 
modulator treatment authorized. The Committee considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage for the patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The present extension of indication “Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 
mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at 
least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene” 
falls within the designated orphan condition ‘treatment of cystic fibrosis’.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed for Kaftrio (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) by the 
positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. Please see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the seriousness of the condition since the time of orphan designation. 
The condition remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
There have been no significant changes in the prevalence of the condition since the time of orphan 
designation. The sponsor calculated the current prevalence based mainly on registry data, concluding 
with a proposed estimate of 0.78 in 10,000 in the EU. This is in line with previous designations 
although more recently some studies suggest a slight increase in prevalence (also as result of better 
available treatments), which would be around 0.9 in 10,000 (not significantly different from the one 
proposed by the sponsor). Recently the COMP has often adopted less than 1 in 10,000 so to allow for 
slight fluctuations of prevalence based on different sources. This figure is also used for the present 
application.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor correctly identifies the currently authorized treatments for the condition, which can be 
broadly classified in: (1) CFTR modulators (i.e. correctors and potentiators) which target the 
underlying cause of the disease, i.e. target CFTR dysfunction; and (2) therapies that manage the 
symptoms, complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy).  
Centrally authorized products for the treatment of CF in the EU are presented in Table 1 below (from

Significant benefit 
The significant benefit is discussed for each of the patient populations covered by the proposed 
extended therapeutic indication.  
NOTE: the significant benefit for F508Del homozygous (F/F) and for patients heterozygous for F508del 
and a minimal function (MF) mutation (patients F/MF) at point 1 and 2 below was already confirmed by 
the COMP in the discussion of the initial MA of Kaftrio or the type II variation (0085) of Kalydeco.  
This extension to other mutations (points 3 and 4 below) was also discussed by the COMP at that time 
and in principle the Committee had favourable views already at that time. 
1.  F508Del homozygous patient population (approximately 45% of the CF patient population) 
Study 103 constitutes the main supportive evidence for the significant benefit in this patient group. 
This was a 4-week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in 
subjects 12 years of age and older with a F508del mutation on both alleles (homozygous). The study 
assessed the added benefit of Kaftrio in comparison with Symkevi (TEZ-/IVA). In both cases the 
products were administered once a day, in combination regiment with Kalydeco, administered in the 
evening. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Kaftrio resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of absolute change in 
ppFEV1 at Week 4 compared to Symkevi, with a treatment difference of 10.0 percentage points 
(P<0.0001). In addition, Kaftrio resulted in a statistically significant decrease in SwCl compared to 
Symkevi, with mean treatment difference of -45.1 mmol/L (P <0.0001 [95% CI: -50.1, -40.1]) for 
absolute change at Week 4, and in a significant increase in CFQ-R RD compared to Symkevi, with a LS 
mean treatment difference of 17.4 points (P<0.0001 [95% CI: 11.8, 23.0]) for absolute change at 
Week 4. Table 2 below shows the results (from the CHMP assessment report). 
2.  Patients heterozygous for F508del and a MF (minimal function) mutation (approximately 25% of 
the total CF population).  
The significant benefit for this patient population is supported by study 102, which was a 24-week 
randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in subjects 12 years of 
age and older, who had an F508del mutation on one allele and a MF mutation on the other allele 
resulting in either no CFTR protein, or a protein that does not respond to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro.  
The difference in the absolute change of ppFEV1 through week 24 between Kaftrio (in combination with 
Kalydeco) and placebo was 14.3% (CI 95%:  12.7 – 15.8; p<0.0001) in favour of Kaftrio. The 
difference was already observable at week 4 (13.7%; CI 95% 12.0 - 15.3; p<0.0001). For pulmonary 
exacerbations, the rate ratio was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25 – 0.55, p<0.0001) in favor of Kaftrio plus 
Kalydeco, with an overall reduction of 63%. The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbations 
was also in favour of Kaftrio (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; nominal p<0.0001). A higher CFQ-R RD 
score was observed in the treated arm compared to the placebo arm (20.2 points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; 
p<0.0001). In addition, an absolute change of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) compared to 
placebo was seen in body mass index (BMI) 
The significant benefit in subjects with MF/F508Del mutation, for which no specific CFTR modulator is 
authorized, was therefore supported, and confirmed by the COMP in July 2020. 
Points 3 and 4 below present a combined discussion on the remaining mutations that have been 
studied by the sponsor, which are now all included in the therapeutic indication ("treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR 
gene”) 
3.  Patients who are heterozygous for F508Del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) 
(approximatively 5% of the total CF population) 
Authorized treatments: Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with Kalydeco 150 mg tablets 
for the treatment of patients with CF aged 12 years and older who are heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and have 1of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, 
A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 
3849+10kbC→T (Section 4.1).  
4) Patients who are heterozygous for F508Del with a gating mutation (F/G) 
Authorized treatments: Kalydeco (IVA) is indicated for the treatment of CF patients who have 1 of the 
following gating mutations, irrespective of the mutation on the other allele (i.e. not specifically 
F508del): G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, R117H, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R 
(Section 4.1). 
Real world data from the US CFFPR for F/RF and F/G patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA was 
provided by the sponsor, from post-marketing use in the US. From 21 October 2019 through 31 
December 2019, a total of 521 F/G or F/RF patients had a record of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment

initiation in CFFPR. Of these patients, 297 patients (57%) had lung function measurements available 
both at baseline and follow-up and were included in these analyses.  
Gating mutations eligible for inclusion in the analyses were G1069R, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551D, 
G551S, R1070Q, R117H, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. RF mutations eligible for inclusion in the 
analyses were 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A->G, 3849+10kbC->T, 711+3A->G, A1067T, A455E, D110E, 
D110H, D1152H, D1270N, D579G, E193K, E56K, E831X, F1052V, F1074L, K1060T, L206W, P67L, 
R1070W, R117C, R347H, R352Q, R74W, S945L, or S977F. 
The vast majority of the F/G and F/RF patients included in this analysis were receiving CFTR modulator 
therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment (97.8% of F/G patients and 89.4% F/RF patients 
were exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019). The mean baseline ppFEV1 values were 
69.0 for the F/G patients and 66.6 for the F/RF patients. An improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline was 
observed for both genotype groups: mean of 4.3 percentage points (95% CI: 2.7, 5.9) for the F/G 
patients, and 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.7, 3.7) for the F/RF patients (Table 2).

b 
Post-treatment ppFEV1 data examined through 15 March 2020 
95% CI was calculated by Vertex based on one sample t test. 
In addition to these data, which were already presented in the initial MA, the sponsor added the results 
from Study 104, an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter 
study in patients with an F/Gating or F/RF genotype. Study 104 was designed to compare ELX/TEZ/IVA 
efficacy to the currently approved CFTR modulator therapy (IVA for F/Gating subjects and TEZ/IVA for 
F/RF subjects).  
In study 104 treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in statistically significant improvements of the 
primary endpoint of FEV1 as well as improvements in clinically relevant secondary endpoints such as 
sweat chloride and functional score of the respiratory domain, CFQ-R RD.  
In patients with F/residual function (RF) mutations, Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco resulted in 
improvement versus standard-of-care Symkevi in the primary endpoint ppFEV1 (LS mean treatment 
difference: 2.0 percentage points; nominal P= 0.0093]), sweat chloride (LS mean treatment difference 
-24.8 mmol/L; nominal P <0.0001]), and CFQ-R RD (8.5 points; nominal P value = 0.0003). The 
secondary endpoints supported the clinical relevance of the relatively small change in ppFEV1 that was 
achieved.   
In patients with F/Gating mutations, Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco resulted in improvements 
versus Kalydeco for percentage predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1: LS mean treatment difference: 5.8 
percentage points; nominal P <0.0001], sweat chloride (LS mean treatment difference: -20.0 mmol/L; 
nominal P <0.0001) and CFQ-R RD (LS mean treatment difference: 8.9 points; nominal P = 0.0008]).  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 9/11 
 
 
 
 
 
The study included a 4-week Run-in Period where subjects received the approved CFTR modulator 
therapy; therefore, the improvement in the Kaftrio group was on top of the improvements that had 
been achieved with treatment with Kalydeco alone, or Symkevi. 
In conclusion, the significant benefit in heterozygous F/RF and F/G mutations is supported by real life 
data from the study performed in the US, as well as by the results of study 104, showing clinically 
meaningful efficacy in patients who had been previously treated with Kalydeco alone, or Symkevi 
(depending on the mutations for which they were authorised).

5.  COMP position adopted on 26 March 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Kaftrio will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition is confirmed. In patients with at least one residual function F508del mutation of 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, Kaftrio in combination with 
Kalydeco showed better efficacy in the primary endpoint of lung function and in relevant secondary 
endpoints as compared to Symkevi, currently authorised for the condition. In patients with gating 
mutations, Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco also showed better efficacy in lung function versus 
Kalydeco alone. In addition, Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco can now be used in all patients 
who have at least one F508del allele. The Committee considers that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kaftrio, ivacaftor, N-(1,3-
dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonyl)-6-[3-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2,2-dimethylpropoxy)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-2-
[(4S)-2,2,4-trimethylpyrrolidin-1-yl]pyridine-3-carboxamide, tezacaftor, (ivacaftor / tezacaftor / 
elexacaftor) for treatment of cystic fibrosis (EU/3/18/2116) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

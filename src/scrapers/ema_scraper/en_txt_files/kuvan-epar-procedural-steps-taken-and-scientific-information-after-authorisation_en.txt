Based on the review of the submitted data, new clinical 
Characteristics (SmPC) in order to reflect new 
paediatric information based on study PKU-015 
evaluating the effect of Kuvan on neurocognitive 
function, maintenance of blood phenylalanine 
concentrations, safety, and population 
SmPC information (section 5.1) related to the long term 
efficacy and safety of Kuvan was added. In young children 
with phenylketonuria (PKU), efficacy parameters were 
within the average range for the normative population.  No 
additional adverse reactions were identified with long-term 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC 
Based on the submission of drug-drug interaction study 
Characteristics (SmPC) for Kuvan in order to update 
the information related to the interaction with P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) and  breast cancer resistant 
protein (BCRP). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
performed in 24 healthy subjects to investigate the effects 
of Kuvan on the pharmacokinetics of a sensitive P-gp 
substrate (digoxin) when given concomitantly, section 5.2 
was updated to include further information on the potential 
for Kuvan to inhibit p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) in the gut at the therapeutic 
doses.  In healthy subjects, administration of a single dose 
of Kuvan at the maximum therapeutic dose of 20 mg/kg 
had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 
digoxin (P-gp substrate) administered concomitantly. Based 
on the in vitro and in vivo results, co-administration of 
Kuvan is unlikely to increase systemic exposure to drugs 
that are substrates for BCRP.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC following

SmPC and PL 
In August 2011 the MAH submitted the 5th PSUR including 
assessment of the 5th PSUR, to reflect cases of 
the relevant safety information for Kuvan.  The CHMP 
Kuvan

hypersensitivity that have been reported. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
concluded in the assessment report that the SmPC should 
be updated regarding hypersensitivity/allergic reactions 
and anaphylactic type reactions. This variation addresses 
this request. 
The review of the cumulative post-marketing data 
presented in the 5th PSUR shows that a causal role of 
Kuvan in the development of “allergic reactions”, “asthma” 
or “rash” could not be established in most of the cases. 
However, isolated reports suggest that the administration 
of Kuvan may be associated with hypersensitivity. 
Twenty reports of hypersensitivity reactions were identified 
by the MAH. In two of these cases the reported 
hypersensitivity reactions were observed within a rather 
short temporal link in the absence of history of allergies, 
which may suggest some relationship with the treatment.  
In three other cases reporting skin rash, a positive 
rechallenge was reported, which appear to support, with a 
reasonable possibility, a causal relationship.  
As the causal association between Kuvan and 
hypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded for these 
cases, the product information regarding 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions has been updated.  
This new identified risk does not affect the benefit/risk ratio 
of Kuvan which remains positive.

SmPC, Annex 
Following the review of the PSUR 3 the CHMP 
to update SmPC to reflect changes in the reporting of 
II and PL 
recommended reviewing the product information in order to 
convulsion cases in the sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC. In addition, numbers in the section 5.1 of the 
SmPC have been rounded for better readability. The 
MAH also took the opportunity to update Annex IIB 
"Other conditions" with the latest wording as per 
October 2010 CHMP announcement regarding the 
Pharmacovigilance system and to update local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
accurately reflect the post marketing reports of convulsion. 
The MAH therefore applied to amend Product Information. 
The risk of convulsion was evaluated using various sources 
including 10-year post-marketing surveillance program, 
Merck Serono Safety Database and literature review. 
Subsequently the sections 4.4 "Special warnings and 
Precautions for use" and 4.5 "Interactions with other 
medicinal products and other forms of interaction" of the 
current SmPC have been updated to reflect changes to the 
Core Data Sheet to reflect data in relation to convulsions 
and exacerbation of convulsions.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pierre Fabre Medicament submitted on 28 July 2017 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Braftovi, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure 
was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 July 2016. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see 
Section 4.4). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0054/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 on 
the granting of a class waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0054/2016 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cutaneous  melanoma,  which  arises  from  the  oncogenic  transformation  of  melanocytes  that  reside  in  the 
epidermal  layer  of  the  skin,  is  the  most  lethal  form  of  skin  cancer,  due  to  its  propensity  to  metastasise  to 
vital  organs,  including  the  brain,  lungs,  liver  and  other  visceral  organs1.  Malignant  melanoma  is  the  19th 
most  common  cancer  worldwide,  with  around  232,000  new  cases  (2%  of  the  total)  diagnosed  in  20122,3. 
Malignant melanoma is the ninth most common cancer in Europe, with 123,135 new cases (3% of the total) 
diagnosed  in  2012.  The  European  incidence  of  malignant  melanoma  varies  from  3  to  5/100  000/year  in 
Mediterranean countries to 12–25 (and rising) in Nordic countries. The most common phenotypic risk factor 
for developing cutaneous melanoma is having fair skin that tends to burn in the sun. Genetic risk factors also 
include inheriting melanocortin-1 receptor variant as well as the presence of high numbers of common naevi 
and those with large congenital naevi, multiple and/or atypical naevi (dysplastic naevi) are at a greater risk 
to  developing  cutaneous  melanoma.  The  most  important  external  risk  factor  is  prolonged  exposure  to  UV 
irradiation, particularly intermittent sun exposure. 
2.1.1.  Biologic features 
There are four main subtypes of cutaneous melanomas: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, 
lentigo  maligna  melanoma,  acral  lentiginous  melanoma.  These  can  be  clinically  and  histologically  defined 
based  on  overall  appearance,  location  and  histologic  features  of  the  melanocytes.  Approximately  50%  of 
patients with metastatic melanoma have mutations in BRAF, and over 95% of these are in BRAF exon 15 at 
V600.  The  most  common  V600  mutations  are  V600E  and  V600K  accounting  for  66-91%  and  7-30%  of  all 
BRAF  V600  mutations,  respectively4,5,6,7,8.  These  mutations  constitutively  activate  BRAF  protein  and 
downstream signal transduction in the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (MAPK pathway), which signals for cancer cell 
proliferation and survival. 
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Over 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumours without any evidence of metastasis. The tumour-
specific  10-year  survival  for  such  tumours  is  75%-85%,  with  10–20%  of  cases  becoming  metastatic  and 
eventually fatal9, . However, the survival rate of unresectable or metastatic melanoma decreases sharply; the

5-year survival rate is 17% and, if left untreated, the median survival is 6-9 months. The clinical presentation 
of cutaneous melanoma varies depending on the subtype but the typical features relate to asymmetry of the 
lesion,  irregular  borders,  colour  and  diameter  of  the  lesions.  The  most  important  prognostic  factors  in 
metastatic  melanoma  are  the  site(s)  of  metastases  (presence  of  visceral  metastases)  and  the  presence  of 
elevated  serum  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH).  Prognosis  is  particularly  poor  in  patients  with  American  Joint 
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV M1c melanoma, defined as disease that has metastasised to visceral 
organs (other than the lungs) and LDH is normal or with elevated LDH and any distant metastases, with an 
estimated 1-year survival rate of 33%10. 
Table 1: 
AJCC staging of melanoma (7th edition) 
2.1.3.  Management 
The  current  treatment  options  for  metastatic  melanoma  include  2  classes  of  agents,  immune  checkpoint 
inhibitors  and  kinase  inhibitors  targeting  the  MAPK  pathway  in  patients  with  BRAF  mutations.  BRAF  and  its 
downstream target, MEK, are kinases in the MAPK pathway, and play an important role in cell proliferation11.

These new therapies have been shown to prolong survival in recent Phase 3 clinical trials12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17, 
with  the  BRAF/MEK  combinations  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  and  dabrafenib/trametinib increasing  the  median 
progression-free  survival  (PFS)  to  approximately  12  months  and  the  median  overall  survival  (OS)  to  22-26 
months in metastatic melanoma with a BRAF mutation,. 
Vemurafenib single-agent was the first BRAF inhibitor to be approved for patients with advanced unresectable 
or  metastatic  BRAF-mutant  melanoma,  followed  by  dabrafenib  single-agent.  In  the  pivotal  Phase  3  studies,  
the median PFS was 5.3 months with vemurafenib and 1.6 months with dacarbazine18  while median PFS was 
5.1 months for dabrafenib and 2.7 months for dacarbazine19. The duration of response (DOR) for single agent 
BRAF inhibition is often short lived, with resistance developing within approximately 6 months,  20, . To delay 
resistance to BRAF inhibition, the combination of BRAF- and a MEK1/2-inhibitors showed prolonged durationof 
the response in patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma21, 22, . In addition, the combination of a MEK 
inhibitor  and  a  BRAF  inhibitor  appears  to  result  in  improved  tolerability  compared  with  either  agent 
alone, , , , . Based on these data, the BRAF/MEK inhibitors have been the standard of care for patients with 
previously untreated unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. Recent 
European  consensus-based  interdisciplinary  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  the  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor 
combinations  dabrafenib/trametinib  or  vemurafenib/cobimetinib  for  the  treatment  of  BRAF-mutated 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients, where targeted therapy is indicated and the combination has 
overtaken BRAF monotherapies (e.g. vemurafenib monotherapy) as the current standard of care. 
About the product 
Encorafenib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor. The half 
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of encorafenib against BRAFV600E, BRAF and CRAF enzymes was 
determined to be 0.35, 0.47 and 0.30 nM, respectively. The encorafenib dissociation half-life was >30 hours 
and resulted in prolonged pERK inhibition. Encorafenib suppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells 
expressing several mutated forms of BRAF kinase (V600E, D and K). Specifically, encorafenib inhibits in vitro 
and in vivo BRAFV600E, D and K mutant melanoma cell growth. Encorafenib does not inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK 
signalling in cells expressing wild-type BRAF.

Encorafenib and binimetinib (a MEK inhibitor, see section 5.1 of binimetinib SmPC) both inhibit the MAPK 
pathway, resulting in higher anti-tumour activity. 
Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib prevented the emergence of resistance in 
BRAFV600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo.  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: not yet assigned

In case of vomiting after administration of encorafenib, the patient should not take an additional dose and 
should take the next scheduled dose. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of unacceptable 
toxicity. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of encorafenib is missed, the patient should only take the missed dose if it is more than 12 hours 
until the next scheduled dose. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The development programme for encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in unresectable or metastatic 
BRAF mutant melanoma comprises data from 10 clinical trials: 4 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy 
volunteers, 1 study in patients with hepatic impairment, 2 clinical pharmacology/ initial tolerability studies in 
patients with BRAF positive tumours and 4 clinical efficacy and safety studies. 
No formal scientific advice was provided by the EMA. In 2013 and 2014, scientific advice was given by 2 
national EU Agencies (MPA, Sweden and MEB, Netherlands) on the design of the pivotal Phase 3 study 
CMEK162B2301, the choice of PFS as primary endpoint for the study as well as the proposed central response 
assessment.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 50 mg or 75 mg of encorafenib as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients of the capsule content are: copovidone (E1208), poloxamer 188, cellulose microcrystalline 
(E460i), succinic acid (E363), crospovidone (E1202), silica colloidal anhydrous (E551) and magnesium 
stearate (E470b). Ingredients of the capsule shell are: gelatin (E441), titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide red 
(E172), iron oxide yellow (E172) and iron oxide black (E172). Ingredients of the printing ink are: shellac 
(E904), iron oxide black (E172) and propylene glycol (E1520). 
The product is available in polyamide/aluminium/PVC/aluminium blister as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of encorafenib is methyl N-{(2S)-1-[(4-{3-[5-chloro-2-fluoro-3-
(methanesulfonamido)phenyl]-1-(propan-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl}pyrimidin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-
yl}carbamate corresponding to the molecular formula C 22H27ClFN7O4S. It has a relative molecular mass of 
540.0 and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 13/171 
  
  
Figure 1: encorafenib active substance structure 
The chemical structure of encorafenib was elucidated by a combination of infrared (IR) spectroscopy, proton 
and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), elemental analysis, 
optical rotation, single crystal X-ray, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic vapour sorption. 
The crystal structure of encorafenib was determined by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) 
Experimental polymorphism studies demonstrated that encorafenib is present in a single polymorphic form: 
"Modification A". Based on the polymorphism study, the absence of routine test for polymorphism in the 
active substance specification is considered acceptable. It was also shown that the polymorphic form does not 
change throughout the shelf life as observed in three batches of the active substance placed on stability 
studies under long-term and accelerated conditions. 
The active substance is a white to almost white non-hygroscopic powder. Although the solubility of 
encorafenib is high at normal gastric pH, it is not sufficiently high across the full range of physiologically 
relevant pH values of the gastrointestinal tract for encorafenib to be characterized as a highly soluble 
compound in the BCS classification system. Because encorafenib demonstrates high apparent permeability, 
its solubility in media with higher pH results in encorafenib being designated as a BCS Class II drug. 
Encorafenib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC/UV. The stereoisomerism of the active substance originates from the 
starting material. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized using a convergent synthesis process bringing together three 
synthetic lines in chemical transformation steps. 
None of the process steps is considered critical; however a number of critical process parameters are defined.  
Encorafenib is proposed for the treatment of an advanced cancer. According to the ICH S9 note for guidance 
and the ICH M7 guideline, active substances and finished products which are indicated for advanced cancer 
are exempt from the requirements of ICH M7; impurities may be controlled in line with the ICH Q3 guideline. 
While genotoxic impurities are not targeted for control to limits specified in the ICH M7 guideline, work 
conducted during pharmaceutical development did confirm that potential genotoxic impurities are not likely to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 14/171 
  
  
 
be present in the final active substance above the calculated concentration limit based on the threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC), which is 22 ppm [(10 µg/day for 1 – 10 years exposure)/(0.45 g 
encorafenib/day)]. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.  
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as risk 
assessment; however no design space is claimed.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (IR), related substances 
(chiral HPLC, UHPLC/UV), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), particle size (laser diffraction) and 
assay (UHPLC/UV). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 11 commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured using the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process are provided. Supportive data on 19 additional batches used during 
development were also provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 batches of the active substance manufactured at scale which is approximately 70% of 
the commercial scale, by the proposed manufacturer and stored in the intended commercial package for up 
to 24 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were representative 
of those manufactured using the proposed commercial process.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances (including the undesired R-
enantiomer), water content, and polymorphic form. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on a single batch. The results 
demonstrate that the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
Results on stress conditions: acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, oxidation, photodegradation, and degradation 
from heat and heat and humidity were also provided on a single batch. However, the degradation products 
resulting from these stress conditions have not been observed in the active substance during pharmaceutical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 15/171 
  
  
development and, therefore, no specific manufacturing process controls have been implemented to address 
these potential degradation pathways. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release hard gelatin capsule for oral administration. Capsules are 
available in two dosage strengths of 50 mg and 75 mg. The 50 mg capsule is size 0 with a Swedish orange 
opaque cap and flesh opaque body, printed with a stylized “A” on the cap and “LGX 50 mg” on the body. The 
length of the capsule is approximately 22 mm. The 75 mg capsule is size 00 with a flesh coloured opaque cap 
and white opaque body, printed with a stylized “A” on the cap and “LGX 75 mg” on the body. The length of 
the capsule is approximately 23 mm. Two presentations differ in terms of size, colouring and imprints. 
The critical quality attributes identified are: appearance, aspect (absence of visual capsule defects), size, 
identification, assay, uniformity of dosage units, degradation products, dissolution, crystallisation of active 
substance, water content and microbial limits. 
As mentioned earlier in the report the active substance is a BCS Class II substance.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality are compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except for succininc acid for which there is no Ph. Eur. monograph. This excipient is controlled 
according to an in-house monograph based on the USP-NF monograph.  There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of active substance with excipients described was evaluated to determine the potential of 
excipients to cause significant active substance instability. 
The manufacturing site that was used for the production of pivotal clinical batches and primary stability 
batches is the proposed commercial manufacturing site. Early development batches and some pivotal batches 
were manufactured at the development site using the initial manufacturing process. The initial manufacturing 
process was optimised prior to being transferred to the commercial site. The same equipment class was used 
for each unit operation at each manufacturing site. A comparison of the capsule manufacturing process 
parameters used at both sites has been provided and considered acceptable. The changes in process 
parameters have been supported by conducting optimisation studies. Following the manufacturing process 
development, the critical process parameters were  identified and the proven acceptable ranges have been 
established, however no design space is claimed. 
The first in human formulation was based on a microemulsion, which was replaced by a capsule formulation 
in Phase 1 clinical development. The capsule formulation was used throughout clinical development, including 
the pivotal clinical study, and is the same as the proposed commercial capsule formulation. The finished 
product formulation, using a common blend for capsules of different strengths, has remained consistent 
throughout development. 
The 50 mg and 75 mg capsule strengths were developed for easier administration compared to the 100 mg 
capsules used in clinical trials. The 75 mg presentation represents a balance between capsule size and 
capsule burden (the number of capsules to be taken daily). The 100 mg strength finished product used in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 16/171 
  
  
clinical trials was encapsulated in a size 00EL capsule (length: ~25.5 mm). The size of the 100 mg capsules 
was considered large and patients may find it difficult in administering the capsules. Although the number of 
the 75 mg capsules to be taken all at once (six capsules) is considered relatively high, considering the 
indication of Braftovi is for the treatment of an advanced cancer, and to allow easier administration, the 
proposed strengths of 50 mg and 75 mg are considered appropriate. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  polyamide/aluminium/PVC/aluminium  blister.  The  material  complies  with  Ph. Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured using a non-standard manufacturing process. There are no critical steps 
or intermediates in the manufacture of finished product. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  on  three  batches  of 
each  of  the  capsule  strength.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed PARs (Proven Acceptable Ranges). 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
of  capsule  (visual),  appearance  of  contents  (visual),  identification  (UV,  UHPLC/UV),  assay  (UHPLC/UV), 
degradation products (UHPLC/UV), crystalline finished product content (XRPD), uniformity of dosage units by 
content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.  -  HPLC/UV),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.  –  KF),  and 
microbiological enumeration and specified micro-organisms (Ph. Eur). 
The undesired R-enantiomer is controlled in the active substance specification but not in the finished product 
release specification. The R-enantiomer is analysed on the finished product during stability studies. No 
changes in its level have been observed. Therefore, it is considered acceptable not to control R-enantiomer in 
the finished product specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six batches of each of the capsule strengths at commercial scale and 
38 development batches of the finished product confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and 
its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 17/171 
  
  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  six  batches  of  each  of  the  capsule  strengths  at  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished 
product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 24 months under 
intermediate  conditions  (30  ºC  /  75%  RH)  and  for  up  to  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  / 
75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay and degradation products, dissolution, water content, undesired 
R-enantiomer content (HPLC), crystalline active substance content by XRPD, and microbial content. The same 
analytical  methods  were  used  as  for  the  release  of  the  product,  apart  from  the  enantiomer  analysis  that  is 
only performed during the stability study. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The proposed shelf life of 27 months is considered acceptable based on the ICH Q1E guideline.  
In  addition,  a  single  batch  of  each  of  the  capsule  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH 
Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Good  chemical  and  physical 
stability  was  shown  upon  direct exposure  to  light.    It  is  concluded  that  special  labelling  or  packaging  is not 
needed  to  mitigate  exposure  to  light.  A  statement  ‘Store  in  the  original  package  in  order  to  protect  from 
moisture’ has been included in the product information. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 27 months when stored in the original package in 
order to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor 
for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed in several in vitro in and in vivo 
models. Non-GLP pharmacology, functional, molecular (mechanism of action) and anti-cancer efficacy studies 
were performed to evaluate the level of activity of encorafenib alone and in combination with binimetinib in 
both in vitro (isolated enzyme and cell culture) and in vivo (mouse xenograft) model systems. No PK, ADME 
or toxicology studies have been performed with the combination. The safety pharmacology studies and the 
pivotal toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Encorafenib  and  the  major  circulating  metabolite,  LHY746  (AR00492720-01) were  tested  for  the potency  to 
inhibit wild type BRAF, V600E mutant BRAF, and CRAF using a radiometric assay format. 
The IC50 of the metabolite LHY746 against BRAFV600E, BRAF and CRAF enzymes was determined to be 9.27, 
15.54 and 9.1 nM, respectively. The IC50 of encorafenib against BRAFV600E, BRAF and CRAF enzymes was 
0.8, 1.1 and 0.6 nM. 
The selectivity of encorafenib (LGX818) was profiled by evaluating inhibitory activity against 442 kinases at 
10  μM  (KinomeScan;  Ambit).  There  were  40  hits  (<25%  percent  of  control)  which  were  followed  up  in  a 
dose-response  study.  The  dose-response  study  confirmed  activity  on  BRAF,  BRAFV600E  and  CRAF.  The  only 
other kinases inhibited with an IC50 of similar magnitude (less than 10 nM) was STK36 (~ 5 nM).  
Viability  and  p-ERK  Inhibition  by  Encorafenib  in  BRAF-Mutant  Humans  Melanoma  Cell  Lines  (RD-
2011-50435, RD-2011-50039, 818-CBiology-0117) 
Encorafenib was evaluated in a panel of 512 genetically annotated human cancer cell lines for effects on cell 
viability and/or proliferation (Cell Titer Glo™ assay). 
The  majority  of  cell  lines  that  were  sensitive  to  encorafenib  contained  the  BRAFV600E  allele.  In  contrast,  cell 
lines  lacking  this  allele  were  predominantly  insensitive  to  encorafenib.  In  a  follow-up  assay,  6  colorectal 
derived  lines  and  26  melanoma-derived  cell  lines,  all  of  which  harbored  V600  alterations  (E,  D  or  K),  were 
examined for sensitivity to encorafenib. Results showed that 4/6 (67%) of the colorectal, and 19/26 (73%) of 
the melanoma cell lines were responsive to encorafenib.

Encorafenib was titrated in the A375 BRAF mutant melanoma cell line for viability (Cell Titer Glo™ assay) and 
for  phosphorylation  of  extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase  (p-ERK;  in-cell  Western  blot)  (RD-2011-50039). 
Both assays detect the modulation of phosphor-ERK or phosphor-MEK. The EC50 was calculated to be 0.004 
µM for the in-cell Western blot and 0.003 µM for the proliferation assay. 
Figure 2:  
The  studies  showed  that  encorafenib  is  approximately  2-fold  more  potent  than  the  metabolite  LHY746  at 
Cell proliferation assay in A375 melanoma cells treated with encorafenib 
inhibiting  phospho-ERK  (33nM  vs  76  nM)  and  approximately  30  fold  more  potent  than  LHY746  at  inhibiting 
Malme-3M proliferation (3.7 nM vs 120 nM).

with a fixed dose of binimetinib on MEL13B4 BRAFV600E mutant-melanoma PDX tumour growth in nude 
mice. There were 8 treatment groups: vehicle (1% CMC/0.5 % Tween 80 in water), binimetinib (binimetinib, 
3.5 mg/kg, PO, BID), encorafenib (encorafenib, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg, PO, QD) and 3 combination treatment 
groups with binimetinib (binimetinib, 3.5 mg/kg, PO, BID) plus encorafenib (encorafenib, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg, 
PO, QD)(Figure 7).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Off target activity of encorafenib (NVP-LGX818) 
Encorafenib (NVP-LGX818) was assessed for its off-target activity on 143 GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, 
nuclear receptors and enzymes. Activities of > 50% inhibition or activation at 10 μM were consistently found 
only in the PDE4D enzymatic assay (IC50 = 4.4 μM, n=3). 
Encorafenib was tested on 7 targets which have been identified as being potentially involved in suicidality. 
The compound had no activity up to the highest concentrations tested. 
Off-target activity of NVP-LHY746 (A Primary Metabolite of LGX818) 
NVP-LHY746 (a primary metabolite of LGX818) was assessed for its off-target activity on 56 GPCRs, 
transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes. Activities of >50% inhibition at 10 μM were found 
on KDR kinase (IC50 = 1.8 μM, n=1) and phosphodiesterase PDE4D (IC50 = 4.2 μM, n=2). It was also found 
to be an agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) (EC50 = 3.8 μM, n=1).

oral absorption of [14C]encorafenib, 
estimated from dose-normalized AUCs for 
radioactivity after IV and oral doses, was 
estimated to be approximately 60-80% 
based on blood and plasma, respectively. 
The bioavailability in this study was 
calculated to be approximately 22%. 
Metabolic evaluation see section 3.4. 
Tissue distribution/Melanin Binding 
Tissue distribution studies were performed for drug-derived carbon-14 material using quantitative whole body 
autoradiography (DMPK R1100588) in Long Evans Hooded (pigmented) rats at 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 7, 24, 72 and 
168 hours following a single oral (50 mg/kg) dose of [14C]encorafenib, and at 0.05 and 2 h following a single 
intravenous (5 mg/kg) dose. Additionally, one HanWistar (albino) rat was sacrificed at 168 hours post 50 
mg/kg oral dose for comparison. [14C]encorafenib-derived radioactivity was absorbed and widely distributed 
to tissues in rats following a single oral (PO) dose with most tissue radioactivity concentrations reaching 
Cmax between 0.25 to 2 h post-dose.  The tissue:blood ratio based on AUCinf of radioactivity was >1 for the 
bile, colon wall, liver, and kidney pelvis, cortex, and medulla. The elimination of drug-related radioactivity 
was moderate in most tissues (t1/2 < ~10 h), except for the liver (t1/2 = 47.2 h). At 72 h post dose, 
radioactivity in most tissues was not measurable, except for the kidney medulla and liver. Overall, the tissue 
distribution pattern after an IV dose was similar to that after an oral dose. Drug-related [14C]encorafenib 
radioactivity showed little or no distribution to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and no 
retention in the melanin-rich tissues (skin and uveal tract). No radioactivity was detected in either pigmented 
or non-pigmented rats at 168 hour. 
Plasma protein Binding and Blood Plasma Ratio 
Plasma protein binding, which appeared to be independent of encorafenib concentration, ranged from 74.6 to 
98.6% across species, with high binding in rodents and moderate binding in other species (DMPK R1100210). 
In humans, the mean plasma protein binding of encorafenib was moderate, approximately 86.1%, when 
evaluated by the ultracentrifugation method over the concentration range evaluated (50 to 50,000 ng/mL). 
The blood-to-plasma concentration ratios, which also appeared to be independent of encorafenib 
concentration, ranged from 0.61 to 0.81 across species (0.75 in humans). In humans, the blood-to-plasma 
ratio was approximately 0.75 over the concentration range evaluated (50 to 50000 ng/mL).

In vivo Metabolism in Sprague-Dawley Rat 
Encorafenib was the major circulating drug-related component in the plasma after either IV or oral dosing, 
contributing 85% to the total radioactivity by AUC0-24h regardless of administration route. All circulating 
metabolites were <5% of total radioactivity in plasma of rats for IV and PO administration. The major 
metabolic pathways of encorafenib in the rat involved oxidative N-dealkylation which included loss of the 
isopropyl moiety (M32.7), loss of the isopropyl-carbamic acid methyl ester side chain (M42.5A), and loss of 
both the isopropyl moiety and the isopropylcarbamic acid methyl ester side chain (M23.8). Together, these 
three metabolites accounted for ~62% of the dose eliminated in rat excreta after intravenous dosing. 
The majority of the dose recovered in rat excreta was found in the faeces with a smaller amount in the urine 
following both routes of administration. In urine, metabolite M23.8 (a double N-dealkylated metabolite 
derived from the loss of both the isopropyl moiety and the isopropyl carbamic acid methyl ester side chain) 
was the predominant component, with minimal unchanged encorafenib. In faeces, ~9.96% (intravenous) and 
~45.7% (oral) of the dose was associated with unchanged encorafenib, while metabolite M32.7 (N-
desisopropyl encorafenib) was the most abundant metabolite. 
The most abundant component in faeces of bile duct-cannulated rats was unchanged encorafenib, accounting 
for 5.50% and 57.8% of the administered dose for the intravenous and oral groups, respectively. 
Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 
The effect of selective chemical inhibitors of CYP enzymes on the rate of total oxidative 
[14C]encorafenib metabolism in human liver microsomes was also determined. The maximal percent 
inhibition achieved by CYP3A inhibitors (ketoconazole and azamulin) was 76.3%. The inhibitor quinidine 
(CYP2D6) inhibited total [14C]encorafenib oxidative metabolism by 36.5%. After accounting for enzyme 
abundance in the liver, CYP3A4 was predicted to be the major enzyme contributing to total oxidative 
clearance of encorafenib in human liver microsomes (~83.3%), followed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (~16.0% 
and 0.71%, respectively). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor posaconazole when co-administered with encorafenib 
resulted in ~2.7-fold increase in encorafenib AUC0-24h; co-administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor 
diltiazem resulted in ~1.8-fold increase in encorafenib AUC0-24h.   
In vivo Metabolism in Monkey 
In monkey plasma, [14C]encorafenib accounted for 40% and 10% of the total radioactivity AUClast, after IV 
and PO administration, respectively. The most prominent plasma metabolites were M22.5A (formed through 
carbamate hydrolysis followed by oxidative deamination, N-dealkylation, and hydroxylation, accounting for 
23% of total radioactivity after IV dosing and 42% after PO dosing) and M23.8 (N-dealkylated metabolite 
derived from loss of both the isopropyl moiety and the isopropyl-carbamic acid methyl ester side chain, 
accounting for 7.8% of total radioactivity after IV dosing and 12% after PO dosing). Overall [14C]encorafenib 
was extensively metabolized to multiple metabolites, where only 2.51% or 6.19% of intact encorafenib 
remained in excreta after either an intravenous or an oral dose, respectively. 
Enzyme Induction and Inhibition 
CYP Inhibition 
Encorafenib was assessed as a potential inhibitor of cytochrome P450s in vitro in human liver microsomes 
with appropriate probe substrates. Encorafenib showed inhibitory potency for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 
with IC50 values of ~1, ~5 and ~8-15 μM, respectively. Encorafenib showed inhibitory potency for CYP1A2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 29/171 
  
  
CYP2C8, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 with IC50 values of ~22, ~20-30, ~50 and ~25 μM, respectively. Very little 
or no inhibition of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 was observed at encorafenib concentrations of up to 100 μM. 
Encorafenib was also assessed as a potential time-dependent inhibitor of cytochrome P450s in human liver 
microsomes. Encorafenib showed no apparent time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 at 
encorafenib concentrations of up to 50 μM and weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5. 
UGT Inhibition 
Encorafenib was assessed as a potential inhibitor of UGT1A1 in vitro using pooled human liver microsomes 
and recombinant UGT1A1. In vitro experiments indicate that encorafenib is a relatively potent inhibitor of 
UGT1A1. In pooled microsomes, with estradiol as the probe substrate the IC50 was ~7 μM and with 
binimetinib (MEK162) as the probe substrate the IC50 was ~1-4 μM. In an assay using recombinant UGT1A1, 
with estradiol as the probe substrate the IC50 was ~4 μM and with binimetinib as the probe substrate the 
IC50 was ~3.5 μM. 
CYP Induction 
The potential for encorafenib to activate the human pregnane X-receptor (PXR) was assessed in a cell-based 
reporter gene assay. Assay results indicated a moderate risk of CYP3A4 induction in vitro by encorafenib (≥ 
10-50 μM), as the PXR activation ranged between 25-40% of the positive control RIF response at these 
concentrations. 
Encorafenib was investigated as an in vitro inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes in 2 studies based on mRNA as well as activity. Encorafenib was found to be an in vitro inducer 
of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 based on mRNA and activities (levels > 2-fold) in at least one of the 
three donor hepatocytes. Maximal CYP1A2 induction by encorafenib (1-100 μM) was 13.0- to 39.2-fold based 
on mRNA and 2.12- to 3.76-fold based on activity. Maximal CYP2B6 induction donors. Maximal CYP2C9 
induction was 2.8- to 5.41-fold based on mRNA but only exceeded 2- fold based on activity in 2 of 3 donors. 
Maximal CYP3A4 induction was 24.9- to 167-fold based on mRNA and 2.21- to 4.97-fold based on activity. It 
can be concluded that encorafenib is an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 mRNA and activity 
when evaluated in vitro. 
Routes and Extent of Excretion 
A mass balance excretion study were performed in intact and bile duct-cannulated rats dosed with 
[14C]encorafenib. Following IV dosing of [14C]encorafenib at 5 mg/kg in intact rats, urinary and faecal 
excretion accounted for approximately 24.3% and 74.1% of total radioactivity, respectively. Within 48 hours 
after a single dose (IV or oral) approximately 86.9-95.9% of the dose was excreted into urine and faeces. By 
7 days following [14C]encorafenib administration, by either the IV or oral routes, total recovery of 
radioactivity in the excreta was approximately 99% or 97.4%, respectively. 
A mass balance excretion study was also performed in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 
[14C]encorafenib. Following IV dosing of [14C]encorafenib at 3 mg/kg, more radioactivity was excreted in 
the faeces (68.2%) than urine (14.4%) over a 7 day period (0-168 h). Approximately 0.08% of the 
encorafenib dose was excreted unchanged in urine and 2.43% in faeces after an IV dose in the monkey. 
Following PO dosing of [14C]encorafenib at 20 mg/kg, again more radioactivity was excreted in the faeces 
(59.7%) than urine (17.4%) over a 7 day period. The total recovery of [14C]encorafenib-derived 
radioactivity in excreta (including cage washes) after an IV and PO dose was approximately 95.0% and 
90.6% over a 7 day period, respectively. Approximately 0.16% of encorafenib was excreted unchanged in 
urine and 6.03% in faeces after a PO dose in the monkey.

Local Tolerance  
Three male New Zealand White rabbits were exposed to 500 mg of encorafenib, moistened with 0.4 mL water 
by application onto clipped skin for 4 hours using a semi-occlusive dressing. Skin reactions were assessed 1, 
24, 48 and 72 hours post exposure. No skin irritation, corrosion or discoloration was caused by 4 hours 
exposure to encorafenib. 
Other toxicity studies 
In vitro phototoxicity study (vh 090801 – non-GLP) 
Encorafenib was assayed for phototoxicity to BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast cells using the Neutral Red Uptake assay.  
Cells  were  treated  with  a  range  of  encorafenib  concentrations  up  to  185.18  µM  or  the  positive  control 
(chlorpromazine). With encorafenib treatment, in the absence of UV-vis light, there was a minimal decrease 
in  cell  survival.  In  the  presence  of  UV-vis  light,  cytotoxicity  was  observed  at  the  highest  5  concentrations 
analysed  (1.86  to  185.15  µM).  The  Photo-Irritation-Factor  (PIF)  was  estimated  to  be  >82.  The  PIF  for  the 
positive control was 33.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro, encorafenib was shown to be a selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor which 
suppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells expressing BRAFV600E and other muttions (K/D/R) at 
position V600. The treatment with encorafenib showed that phosphorylated MEK (pMEK) and phosphorylated 
ERK (pERK) in A375 human melanoma cells was suppressed as well as inhibition of cell proliferation. 
Encorafenib had no anti-proliferative activity in tumour cell lines that express wild-type BRAF. The primary 
metabolite, LHY746, was evaluated in in vitro activity studies and was inactive in the  inhibition of melanoma 
cell proliferation. Consequently, in the efficacy and safety studies LHY746 exposure was not assessed. 
Tumour regression has been demonstrated in various models at doses as low as 0.6 mg/kg with reproducible 
and robust effects, including at dose levels of > 3 mg/kg (the absolute exposure (AUC) at the of 5 mg/kg/d is 
6.5 μg.h/mL. However, the effect was transient with encorafenib as a single agent and the majority of 
tumours developed resistance over the course of 4 months of treatment. The combination of encorafenib and 
binimetinib prevented the emergence of resistant tumours over the 4 month duration of the study resulting in 
enhanced survival. These data support the hypothesis that combining encorafenib and binimetinib will be 
efficacious in treating human melanoma. 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in male rats and monkeys to assess the effects of encorafenib 
on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurobehavioral systems. There were no significant in vivo safety 
findings at doses up to 100 mg/kg in rats. 
No preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were performed with encorafenib and binimetinib in combination, this 
is acceptable as data in clinical studies are deemed more informative. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic evaluations showed that encorafenib demonstrated high selectivity for BRAF 
versus over 143 GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes. Therefore, off-target 
kinase activity at relevant free-therapeutic concentrations in vivo is not anticipated. 
The lack of distribution to the CNS is likely due to encorafenib being a P-gp substrate, as P-gp is an important 
component of the endothelial cell blood-to-brain barrier. 
The lack of studies on pharmacodynamics drug interactions, single dose toxicity, carcinogencity and 
reproduction toxicity are acceptable as per the ICH S9 guideline.  
In the 4 week and 13 week rat toxicity studies, clinical signs, reduced body weight reduced epididymides and 
prostate weights and microscopic findings in testes, epididymides, stomach and skin were noted. Partial 
reversibility of these findings was noted after a 4 week recovery period. There are no data on the effects of 
encorafenib on fertility in humans. Based on findings in animals, the use of encorafenib may impact fertility in 
males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). As the clinical relevance of this is unknown, male patients 
should be informed of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis. Additionally, in the 13 week rat 
toxicity study, reversible clinical pathology changes were noted at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/d. No NOAEL could be 
established for the 4 week study. The NOAEL for the 13 week study was at 14  to 32 times human 
therapeutic exposures. 
In the 4 week and 13 week monkey toxicity study, isolated/sporadic episodes of emesis and diarrhoea as well 
as ophthalmic lesions were observed at slightly above human therapeutic exposures. Ophthalmic lesions were 
partially reversible and consisted of a separation or detachment in the retina between the outer rods and 
cones layer and retinal pigmented epithelium at the central macula at the fovea. This observation was similar 
to that described in humans as central serous like chorioretinopathy or central serous retinopathy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 39/171 
  
  
Encorafenib was not genotoxic. 
Fertility studies were not conducted with encorafenib. In the sub-acute 28 day and sub chronic 13 week rat 
toxicology studies, encorafenib treatment at 20 mg/kg/d (dose level approximately 8 times the human 
exposure at the recommended dose) resulted in decreased testes and epididymis weights with tubular 
degeneration and oligospermia. In the 13 week study, partial reversibility was noted at the highest dose level 
(60 mg/kg/d). The embryo-foetal development study in rats indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity 
with lower foetal weights and delays in skeletal development. A warning on the risk for pregnant women and 
to the foetus has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Women of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraception during treatment with encorafenib and for at least 1 month following the last dose. 
Encorafenib may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, female 
patients using hormonal contraception are advised to use an additional or alternative method such as a 
barrier method (e.g. condom) during treatment with encorafenib and for at least 1 month following the last 
dose. 
The embryo-foetal development study in rabbits indicated that encorafenib induced foetal toxicity with lower 
foetal weights and transitory changes in skeletal development. Dilatation of the aortic arc was observed in 
some foetuses. 
It is unknown whether encorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in human. A risk to the newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
encorafenib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the mother.  
Encorafenib was phototoxic in an in vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Test. Encorafenib was not a sensitiser in 
the in vivo mouse sensitization assay. Collectively, these data indicate that encorafenib has a risk of 
phototoxic potential and minimal risk for sensitization at therapeutic doses in patients. 
Encorafenib is not expected to bioaccumulate, or to show any significant transfer to sludge and soil. 
Therefore, encorafenib is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment. As for all non-readily 
biodegradable human medicines, patients should be advised not to dispose of unused encorafenib drug 
product via wastewater. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the marketing 
authorisation application for encorafenib were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of 
non-clinical aspects. The risks to fertility and embryo-foetal development observed in the non-clinical studies 
have been included in the SmPC. Encorafenib is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of encorafenib was assessed in 1 clinical study conducted in healthy subjects administered single- 
agent encorafenib (Study CLGX818A2101), 1 clinical study conducted in advanced cancer patients 
administered single-agent encorafenib (Study CLGX818X2101) and 3 clinical studies conducted in advanced 
cancer patients administered encorafenib in combination with binimetinib (Studies CMEK162X2110, 
CGLX818X2109 and CMEK162B2301). 
Absorption 
Because encorafenib demonstratesd high apparent permeability and its solubility in media with higher pH,  
encorafenib was designated as a BCS Class II drug. 
In the clinical ADME study CLGX818A2101, 4 healthy subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C]-
encorafenib. The extent of oral absorption was estimated to be at least ~86% based on a mean of 47.2% of 
the radioactivity dose eliminated in the urine and 39% of the radioactivity dose recovered in the faeces as 
metabolites.  
After oral administration, encorafenib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hours. 
Table 17:   Summary statistics of plasma PK parameters for encorafenib (PAS) - Study 
CLGX818A2101 
Influence of food 
The effect of food on encorafenib PK was evaluated in Study ARRAY-818-102.  
The administration of a single oral 100 mg dose of encorafenib with food resulted in no significant change in 
total exposure (i.e., AUC) following a High Fat Meal (HFM); however, the rate of absorption for encorafenib 
was slower in the fed state, as evidenced by an approximate 2.3-hour delay in the time to maximum 
observed plasma concentration (i.e., Tmax) and a lower peak concentration (i.e., 340.5 ng/mL lower Cmax) 
in the fed state.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 45/171 
  
  
 
The AUCinf decreased by approximately 4% after administration of a HFM (GMR=95.91%); however, the 
treatment groups were bioequivalent in terms of the AUCinf as indicated by the 90% CI of the GMR (91.62, 
100.39). 
Peak exposure (i.e., Cmax) decreased by approximately 36% (GMR=63.97%) and this change was found to 
be statistically significant as indicated by the 90% CI of the GMR for Cmax (57.73, 70.90). The non-
parametric median differences in Tmax (2.253 [90% CI 2.002, 2.516]) were also found to be statistically 
significant (p < 0.0001) between the 2 treatments.

Distribution 
In the human ADME study, the mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio for total radioactivity was 0.58. 
The in vitro mean plasma protein binding of encorafenib was approximately 86.1% over the concentration 
range of 50 to 50,000 ng/mL. The in vitro mean protein binding for AR00492720 (encorafenib metabolite) 
was 95.8, 89.6 and 88.6 in rat, monkey and human plasma, respectively.  
The geometric mean (% CV) Vz/F for encorafenib was 226 L (32.7%).  
Based on the population PK analysis, the typical initial distribution half-life into the second compartment of 
the population PK model was 0.34 hours and the total volume of the central compartment (V/F) was 27 L. 
Elimination 
In the ADME study, 4 healthy subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C]-encorafenib. The plasma 
encorafenib concentrations exhibited a biphasic elimination. The extent of oral absorption was estimated to 
be at least ~86% based on a mean of 47.2% of the radioactivity dose eliminated in the urine and 39% of the 
radioactivity dose recovered in the faeces as metabolites.  
The percentage of the dose eliminated in the urine as unchanged encorafenib was approximately 1.8% of the 
apparent total clearance after oral administration (CL/F). The estimated mean encorafenib renal clearance 
(CLr) was 0.5 L/h and was 7% of the glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), suggesting minimal involvement of 
renal transporters in its elimination process. The percentage of the dose eliminated in the faeces as 
unchanged encorafenib was also minor with a mean of 5.0%. 
Therefore, metabolism was found to be the major clearance pathway (~88% of the recovered radioactive 
dose) for encorafenib in humans.  
In the same study, the median (range) t1/2 for encorafenib was 6.32 hours (3.74 to 8.09 hours). The 
geometric mean (% CV) CL/F and apparent volume of distribution following oral administration (Vz/F) were 
26.6 L (36.3%) and approximately 226 L (32.7%), respectively. 
Based on the population PK analysis, the population estimate of CL/F for encorafenib was 27.9 L/h. The 
elimination t1/2 derived with the model was 12.1 h. 
In the ADME study in human, metabolism was found to be the major clearance pathway (~88% of the 
recovered radioactive dose) for encorafenib in humans, leading to an estimated level of oral absorption of at 
least ~86%.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose proportionality for encorafenib was assessed for AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss  over pooled dose ranges of 
50 to 800 mg and 50 to 600 mg.  
Encorafenib was rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax that ranged from 0.50 to 2.50 hours across doses. 
Plasma AUCs and Cmax of encorafenib increased in a slightly less than dose-proportional manner as the 
encorafenib dose increased from 50 to 800 mg on Day 15. Encorafenib concentrations rapidly declined and 
the geometric mean t1/2 was similar across doses (ranging from 2.88 to 4.63 hours).  
Accumulation of encorafenib was also assessed with an ANOVA performed on log-transformed AUCtau,ss and 
Cmax,ss using an LME model with day (Day 15 versus Day 1) as a fixed effect and subject as a random 
Assessment report

effect. The estimated ratios for Cmax (RCmax) and for AUC (RAUC) were 0.63 and 0.45, respectively, which 
is consistent with the effect of auto-induction of CYP3A4. The intra-subject variability was approximately 
37.36% and 36.40%, respectively. 
The typical CL/F of encorafenib was estimated to be 34% faster after Cycle 1 Day 1. An Emax function was 
used to describe time-dependent behaviour for the CL/F of encorafenib during the treatment, with 50% of the 
maximum CL/F (T50) achieved at 18.33 hours after the 1st administration.

Population PK 
The final population PK model of encorafenib consisted of a 2-compartment model with time varying 
clearance. The absorption of encorafenib was described with a first-order rate of absorption.  
The population estimates of CL/F and V/F for encorafenib were 27.9 L/h and 14.1 L, respectively. The t1/2 
derived with the model was 12.1 h. Total volume of distribution was 27.3 L.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The applicant did not submit studies in renal impaired patients. However, the effect of the mild and moderate 
renal impairment on the PK of encorafenib was evaluated using a population PK approach. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, no clear trend in encorafenib CL/F was observed in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment compared with 
subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). A small decrease in CL/F (≤5%) was 
predicted for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant.   
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of 50 mg encorafenib was investigated in mild hepatic impairment subjects versus 
healthy subjects. Healthy subjects were enrolled based on matched age, gender and body weight to a hepatic 
impaired subject and could have matched more than one subject in a different impairment group. The lowest 
possible dose of 50 mg encorafenib was administered in this study. After review of the safety and PK data, a 
total of 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 6 matching healthy subjects were dosed. Results from 
this cohort indicated an approximate 25% increase in overall encorafenib exposure (AUCinf) in subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment compared with matching healthy subjects. Considering the unbound encorafenib 
fraction, Cmax was increased by 21%, AUC increased by 55% and Cl/F reduced by 36%. 
Table 22:  Geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation) plasma 
pharmacokinetic parameters for encorafenib and unbound encorafenib 
FU: fraction of encorafenib unbound. 
In the population PK analysis, the covariate of hepatic impairment indicated no significant impact on the 
encorafenib CL/F or V/F when comparing healthy subjects with mild hepatic impairment subjects. Information 
on unbound encorafenib fraction (6.77%) from the healthy volunteers obtained in the HI study ARRAY-818-
101 was included to predict AUC and Cmax and was also compared with predicted values based on previous 
in vitro FU values (13.9%). 
The model predicted an unbound encorafenib fraction for subjects with Child-Pugh A of 8.17% (ex vivo value 
measured in the clinical HI study was 8.4%.  
Gender 
Based on the results of the population PK modelling, gender was not retained as a covariate in the final 
model for encorafenib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 50/171 
  
  
  
Race 
Based on the results of the population PK modelling, no apparent trend for V/F and race or ethnic origin was 
observed in the exploratory plots. 
Weight 
Based on the results of the population PK modelling, for an individual in the 95th percentile of weight (i.e. 
112 kg), the population PK analysis indicated a 11.4% increase in CL/F compared to the typical individual of 
78 kg. For an individual in the 5th percentile of weight (i.e. 54 kg), the population PK analysis indicated an 
8.5% decrease in CL/F compared to the typical individual of 75 kg. The exponent for weight on clearance in 
the POPPK model was 0.27.  
Elderly 
Age as a covariate was not retained in the final model on the CL/F term.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The available data suggest that CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme likely to cause a clinical DDI. CYP3A4 is the 
major enzyme contributing to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver microsomes (~83.3%), 
followed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (~16.0% and 0.71%, respectively), with CYP2C19 being the major 
contributor (70.1%) to the oxidative metabolism of AR0049272. 
Given that encorafenib is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the effect of both CYP3A4 
and P-gp transporter inhibitors on encorafenib exposure was evaluated. Based on the results of the PBPK 
analysis, encorafenib can be classified as low-to-moderate passive permeability compound when P-gp is not 
saturated/inhibited and as high passive permeability compound in presence of P-gp inhibitor or at encorafenib 
concentrations higher than 164 μM.  Encorafenib exhibited potential inhibition of P-gp transportation in vitro 
at concentrations up to 1000 µM, with a calculated Ki ~75µM. This is much lower than the calculated gut 
concentrations and the PBPK model predicted local concentrations of 5 mM. 
The predicted DDI effect for ketoconazole and itraconazole were approximately 5-fold and could be classified 
as moderate-to-strong. 
Co-administration of posaconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased the overall encorafenib exposure 
(i.e., AUC) by approximately 3-fold when a multiple dose of posaconazole was co-administered with a single 
dose of encorafenib 50 mg in healthy subjects. Based on the predicted DDI using higher dose of 
posaconazole at the steady state, a similar effect of posaconazole on the PK of encorafenib was observed.

Similarly, co-administration of diltiazem (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp transporter inhibitor) 
increased the overall encorafenib exposure by approximately 2-fold. The Tmax values were similar.  
Encorafenib appears to inhibit hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, renal uptake OAT1, 
OAT3 and OCT2 and BCRP transporter involved in efflux in the gut, liver and kidney.  
The DDI module in GastroPlus™ v. 9.0 was used to run dynamic simulations to predict the extent of DDIs 
between ketoconazole (KET) or itraconazole (ITZ) and CYP3A4 substrates midazolam (MID), triazolam (TRZ), 
and quinidine (QND) using PBPK models. The full itraconazole model overpredicted the DDI effect in four 
studies (ratio of predicted/observed RAUC values ranging from 1.06 to 1.51) and underpredicted the DDI 
effect in the eight remaining studies (ratio of predicted/observed RAUC values ranging from 0.42 to 0.88). In 
clinical studies the observed effect of itraconazole on midazolam PK ranged from 3 to 11-fold increase in AUC 
and the model predicted a range of 2 to 8-fold. For triazolam, the observed effects of itraconazole ranged 
from 2 to 5-fold increases in AUC and the model predicts a slightly lower range of 1.2 to 4-fold. For quinidine 
the observed 2-fold increase in AUC, when co-administered with itraconazole was well predicted by the model 
(1.7 fold).  
The ketoconazole model was evaluated by predicting the DDI effect with MID and TRZ from two different 
studies. The ratio of predicted/observed RAUC was 0.96 and 0.79, respectively. Predictions of inhibition effect 
of posaconazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole on encorafenib PK in patients on day 1 and day 7 after 
coadministration of encorafenib and inhibitor for 7 days were performed and are shown in Table 23.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac safety 
A post hoc analysis of Phase 1 Study CLGX818X2101 was conducted to evaluate the potential for therapeutic 
concentrations of encorafenib to cause QT prolongation (Report CP17-005). An increase in ΔQTcF from 
Baseline of >30ms was observed in 47 out of 105 evaluable patients (44.8%) and an increase in QTcF 
>60ms was observed in 5 patients (4.8%). A new QTcF >480ms occurred in 2 patients (1.9%); no new QTcF 
>500ms were observed. 
The datasets included 77 subjects and 1002 time-matched ECG-concentration pairs for encorafenib and were 
analysed with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. In the central tendency analysis for the 450mg dose 
group, the mean ΔQTcF (upper bound two-sided 90% CI) at 2 hours post-dose (Tmax) was 12.7ms (16.2ms) 
on Day 1 and 19.9ms (26.5ms) on Day 15. For the 300mg dose group, the mean ΔQTcF (upper bound two-
sided 90% CI) at 2 hours post-dose (Tmax) was 5.2ms (9.2ms) on Day 1 and 12.9ms (19.0ms) on Day 15. In 
the escalation phase, the mean maximum postbaseline ΔQTcF across patients at the 300mg dose was 
26.2msec (90% CI = 7.8 to 44.6) and 24.9msec (90% CI = 20.2 to 29.7 msec) at the 450mg dose. In the 
expansion phase, the mean maximum postbaseline ΔQTcF across patients at the 300mg dose was 30.9msec 
(90% CI = 24.8 to 37.0 msec) and 33.4msec (90% CI = 28.0 to 38.8 msec) at the 450mg dose. 
Exposure-safety relationship 
Exposure safety (E-S) analysis was conducted based on 4 clinical studies using logistic regression to model 
predicted AUCss and the expected incidence of selected adverse events, specifically all-grade ALT, and 
≥ grade 2 PPE, pyrexia and diarrhoea. In general, the predicted exposure-safety relationships for both 
substances were similar in combination due to mutual confounding effects.  
However, when the encorafenib dose was fixed, higher AUCss of binimetinib resulted in a higher probability of 
ALT increase relative to encorafenib monotherapy, although not statistically significant.  
The probability of PPED was up to 44% for encorafenib monotherapy and the encorafenib effect was 
attenuated by binimetinib co-administration. Higher binimetinib exposure as indicated by AUCss, Cmaxss and 
Cminss was associated with lower probability of PPED.  
The applicant conducted additional exposure-safety analyses using the updated popPK model; these were 
skin rash (grade≥2), skin infections (grade≥2), skin neoplasms (grade≥2), retinal events (grade≥2), high 
levels of AST (all grades), high levels of GGT (all grades), CK elevations (all grades) and arthralgia (grade≥2). 
Increasing encorafenib exposure in mono-and combination treatment was associated with an increased 
probability of elevated CK (all grades) and a reduced probability of skin infection.  
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS (time-to-event) were derived by high/low exposure (relative to the median) and by 
quartiles of AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss for encorafenib and binimetinib based on the randomised dose.  
Encorafenib monotherapy showed a similar median PFS between patients with higher and lower encorafenib 
exposure (PFS of 9.56 and 9.33 months respectively). PFS was higher in the Combo 450 arm but patients 
with high encorafenib exposure showed lower PFS compared to patients with lower encorafenib exposure 
(11.0 and 18.0 months, respectively). On review, patients with higher encorafenib exposure in the Combo 
450 arm had poorer prognostic factors, particularly an increased proportion with LDH above the median. The

median PFS time in patients with baseline LDH below and above the median were 21.9 and 9.0 months, 
respectively. 
The logistic regression models for ORR and Cox hazard models for PFS were updated and results for Combo 
and encorafenib monotherapy treatments were presented for Part 1 and Part 2 and both parts combined, 
although only limited analyses involving encorafenib monotherapy from Part 2 alone were presented. The 
median PFS with encorafenib monotherapy was shorter in Part 2 (7.36 months) than Part 1 (9.56 months).

The applicant re-evaluated the Cox proportional hazard models for Part 2 and Part 1 and 2 combined utilising 
“corrected” median AUC values. A significant positive treatment effect as a function of encorafenib exposure 
(AUCss) was not established. 
Graphs of the probability of PFS according to encorafenib exposure (AUCss) were provided for Combo 450, 
Combo 300, Enco 300 Part 1 and Enco 300 Part 2 in the D180 responses. Also, graphs of probability of ORR 
and PFS by encorafenib Cmin were provided for these different populations. There was no clear relationship 
between Cminss of encorafenib and PFS or ORR in Part 1 or Part 2 of the COLOMBUS study for single agent 
encorafenib or in combination with binimetinib. It was not possible to establish a target Cmin,ss or Ctrough 
for encorafenib in order to guide dosing. No consistent relationship was observed between AUCss and PFS. 
The only trend (although not statistically significant) was a decrease in PFS with increased encorafenib AUCss 
with Combo450 in Part 1, as noted previously. This could have arisen by chance, due to higher baseline LDH 
levels or be the result of interaction with an unidentified covariate/ confounding factor. Patients with higher 
baseline LDH levels still had a positive treatment effect with Combo450 compared to vemurafenib in terms of 
PFS; however, this was not statistically significant with the confidence interval crossing 1 [PFS Combo 450 
vs. vemurafenib: high LDH HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.47, 1.14); low LDH HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.33, 0.67)].

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours, 
including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harbouring a BRAF V600E or K 
mutation. The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib have been shown to be approximatively dose linear after 
single and multiples doses. After repeat once-daily dosing, steady state conditions were reached within 15 
days. The accumulation ratio of approximately 0.5 is likely due to auto induction of CYP3A4. The inter subject 
variability (CV%) of AUC is ranged from 12.3% to 68.9%.  
Encorafenib is moderately (86.1%) bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Following a single oral dose of 
100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, the mean (SD) blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58 
(0.02) and the mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of encorafenib is 226 L (32.7%). 
After oral administration, encorafenib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hours. Following a 
single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, at least 86% of the encorafenib dose was 
absorbed. Administration of a single 100 mg dose of encorafenib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased 
the Cmax by 36%, while the AUC was unchanged. A drug interaction study in healthy subjects indicated the 
extent of encorafenib exposure was not altered in the presence of a gastric pH-altering agent (rabeprazole). 
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, metabolism was found to be the 
major clearance pathway for encorafenib (approximately 88% of the recovered radioactive dose). The 
predominant biotransformation reaction of encorafenib was N-dealkylation. Other major metabolic pathways 
involved hydroxylation, carbamate hydrolysis, indirect glucuronidation and glucose conjugate formation.  
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg [14C] encorafenib in healthy subjects, radioactivity was eliminated 
equally in both the faeces and urine (mean of 47.2%). In urine, 1.8% of the radioactivity was excreted as 
encorafenib. The mean (CV%) apparent clearance (CL/F) of encorafenib was 27.9 L/h (9.15%). The median 
(range) encorafenib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 6.32 h (3.74 to 8.09 h). 
For dose modifications see Table 1 of the SmPC. Administration of encorafenib at a dose of 450 mg once daily 
as a single agent is not recommended. If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be 
reduced at 300 mg once daily during the time of binimetinib dose interruption (see section 4.2 of binimetinib 
Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]) as encorafenib is not well-tolerated at the dose of 450 mg as a 
single agent. If binimetinib is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should be discontinued. 
If encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see Table 2), binimetinib should be interrupted. If encorafenib is 
permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  
Effect of CYP enzymes on encorafenib  
Encorafenib is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. In vitro, CYP3A4 was predicted to be the major 
enzyme contributing to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver microsomes (~83.3%), 
followed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (~16.0% and 0.71%, respectively).  
Encorafenib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. posaconazole, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole) are expected to have moderate to strong effects on encorafenib exposure. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp transporter inhibitor (e.g diltiazem) are expected to moderately increase 
the overall encorafenib exposure (approximately 2-fold). Concomitant treatment of encorafenib with strong 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 56/171 
  
  
 
 
CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and co-administration with moderate inhibitors should be considered 
with caution. See section 4.5 of the SmPC for information on effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on 
encorafenib exposure.  
Effect of encorafenib on CYP substrates 
In vitro experiments indicate encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, as well as a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Encorafenib induced CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in human primary hepatocytes. Simulations of 450 mg encorafenib co-
administered with probe substrates for CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on Day 1 and 
Day 15 all indicated no clinically relevant interactions are expected. For co-administration with CYP3A4 and 
UGT1A1 substrates that undergo gut extraction, a minor to moderate interaction is expected. While 
binimetinib is a UGT1A1 substrate, it does not undergo gut extraction and therefore no DDI with encorafenib 
is expected. Additionally, no differences in exposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib is co-
administered with encorafenib. 
Encorafenib is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. Concomitant use with agents that are substrates of 
CYP3A4 (e.g., hormonal contraceptives) may result in increased toxicity or loss of efficacy of these agents. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with encorafenib and for 
at least 1 month following the last dose. Encorafenib may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives 
(see SmPC section 4.5). Therefore, female patients using hormonal contraception are advised to use an 
additional or alternative method such as a barrier method (e.g. condom) during treatment with encorafenib 
and for at least 1 month following the last dose. 
Concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with encorafenib should be avoided. If 
concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for safety 
(see section 4.5). Caution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered with 
encorafenib. 
Agents that are CYP3A4 substrates should be co-administered with caution.  
Encorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Concomitant agents that are substrates of UGT1A1 (e.g. raltegravir, 
atorvastatin, dolutegravir) may have increased exposure and should be therefore administered with caution.  
Effect of transporters on encorafenib  
Encorafenib was found to be a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. Inhibition of P-gp is 
unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in encorafenib concentrations as encorafenib exhibits high 
intrinsic permeability. The involvement of several uptake transporter families (OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
OATPB1) was investigated in vitro using relevant transporter inhibitors. The data suggest that hepatic uptake 
transporters are not involved in encorafenib distribution into primary human hepatocytes. 
Effect of encorafenib on transporters  
In vitro, encorafenib inhibited the hepatic transporter OCT1, but is unlikely to be an effective inhibitor 
clinically. Based on in vitro studies, there is potential for encorafenib to inhibit renal transporters OCT2, 
OAT1, OAT3 and hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinical concentrations. In addition, 
encorafenib may inhibit P-gp in the gut and BCRP at the expected clinical concentrations. 
Encorafenib should be therefore co-administered with caution.  (SmPC section 4.6) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 57/171 
  
  
For special populations, in contrast to gender, age and body weight were found to be signifcant covariates for 
volume distribution. However it is unlikely they have a clinically relevant effect and no dose adjustments are 
needed. (SmPC section 4.2 and 5.3). There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the 
exposure of encorafenib by race or ethnicity.  
While encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, no differences in binimetinib exposure 
have been observed clinically when binimetinib was co-administered with encorafenib. 
Encorafenib undergoes minimal renal elimination. No formal clinical study has been conducted to evaluate the 
effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. The covariate analysis showed no clear 
trend evaluating the effect of renal impairment on the encorafenib CL/F in subjects with mild and moderate 
renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. No relationship between renal function 
and V/F was found in the population PK analysis. A small decrease in CL/F (≤5%) was predicted for patients 
with mild and moderate renal impairment, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The pharmacokinetics of 
encorafenib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. A warning has been included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC if administering to severe renal impaired patients. No dose adjustment is required 
for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. 
There are no clinical data with encorafenib in patients with severe renal impairment. Therefore, the potential 
need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. Encorafenib should be used with caution in patients with 
severe renal impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Results from a dedicated clinical study indicate a 25% higher total encorafenib exposures in patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with subjects with normal liver function. This 
translates into a 55% increase of the unbound encorafenib exposure. Therefore, a reduced dose of 
encorafenib 300 mg once daily in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A) is recommended 
in that population (SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4). The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib has not been evaluated 
clinically in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. 
As encorafenib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, based on PBPK modelling, patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment may have greater increases in exposure than patients with mild 
hepatic impairment. No dosing recommendation can be made in patients with moderate (Child Pugh Class B) 
or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). A warning has been included 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC for patients with hepatic impairment, where no dosing recommendation can be 
made in patients with moderate (Child Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment and 
therefore,.encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Closer 
monitoring of encorafenib related toxicities in patients with mild hepatic impairment is recommended, 
including clinical examination and liver function tests, with assessment of ECGs as clinically appropriate 
during treatment. 
Encorafenib and binimetinib combination administration can increase QTc interval at the doses used clinically. 
QT Prolongation has been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors. A thorough QT study to evaluate 
the QT prolongation potential of encorafenib has not been conducted.  
Overall, results suggest that single agent encorafenib has the potential to cause mild increases in heart rate. 
Across pooled combination studies of encorafenib and binimetinib at the recommended doses and a single-
agent encorafenib study, results suggest that encorafenib has the potential to result in small increases in QTc 
interval (see section 5.1). 
There are insufficient data to exclude a clinically significant exposure dependent QT prolongation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 58/171 
  
  
Due to the potential risk for QT prolongation, it is recommended that serum electrolytes abnormalities, 
including magnesium and potassium, are corrected and risk factors for QT prolongation controlled 
(e.g. congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias) before treatment initiation and during treatment. 
It is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is assessed before initiation of encorafenib, one month 
after initiation, and then at approximately 3-month intervals or more frequently as clinically indicated, while 
on treatment. The occurrence of QTc prolongation can be managed with dose reduction, interruption or 
discontinuation with correction of abnormal electrolytes and control of risk factors (see section 4.2). 
PFS was shorter in patients with higher encorafenib exposure in the Combo 450 arm only. As a confounding 
factor, baseline LDH was higher in patients with AUCss above the median and PFS was shorter in patients 
with higher LDH. In the high LDH group in Part 1 of the study only patients with high encorafenib exposure in 
Combo 450 did worse. There was no such finding with Combo 300 in Part 2. The following is concluded from 
the updated exposure-response analyses. Nevertheless, addition of binimetinib has a positive effect on the 
efficacy of encorafenib so combination treatment. 
Graphs of the probability of PFS according to encorafenib exposure (AUCss) and ORR and PFS by encorafenib 
Cmin were provided for Combo 450, Combo 300, Enco 300 Part 1 and Enco 300 Part 2. There was no clear 
relationship between Cminss of encorafenib and PFS or ORR in Part 1 or Part 2 of the COLOMBUS study for 
single agent encorafenib or in combination with binimetinib. It was not possible to establish a target Cmin,ss 
or Ctrough for encorafenib in order to guide dosing. No consistent relationship was observed between AUCss 
and PFS. The only trend (although not statistically significant) was a decrease in PFS with increased 
encorafenib AUCss with Combo450 in Part 1. This could have arisen by chance, due to higher baseline LDH 
levels or be the result of interaction with an unidentified covariate/ confounding factor. Patients with higher 
baseline LDH levels still had a positive treatment effect with Combo450 compared to vemurafenib in terms of 
PFS; however, this was not statistically significant with the confidence interval crossing 1 [PFS Combo 450 
vs. vemurafenib: high LDH HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.47, 1.14); low LDH HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.33, 0.67)].  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data submitted by the applicant are considered sufficient to adequatey characterise the pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic aspects of encorafenib. However, drug interaction will be investigated in a DDI 
cocktail study aimed to evaluate the DDI of encorafenib and binimetinib as perpetrator on relevant metabolic 
pathways and transporters. A reduced dose of encorafenib is recommended in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment while the administration is not recommended in patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment. This information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2. 
Furthermore, biomarker and genomic analyses would be helpful in supporting pharmacodynamic aspects of 
the combination therapy. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
−  DDI cocktail study: OATP and BCRP will be explored in the ongoing DDI study with rosuvastatin 
(study ARRAY-818-103)  
−  Overall survival results stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2).  
−  To collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib to determine the plasma 
concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed to guide dosing recommendations 
in these patient populations.

The CHMP expects the applicant to submit the following measures to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
−  The applicant should commit to submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study 
B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) for evaluation as soon as available, to support the synergistic 
pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib. Genomic analysis of 
baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing. As indicated in the protocol, genomic 
alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, 
EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential association between baseline mutations and 
efficacy outcomes. 
−  The relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes should be performed, and a date 
provided to submit the results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There were 2 early phase studies in patients with V600 mutant tumours (melanoma and colorectal cancer) to 
provide information on encorafenib dosing. 
Phase 1 Study CLGX818X2101 assessed single agent encorafenib at doses up to 700mg QD. The MTD was 
determined to be 450mg QD but, due to the number of patients who required dose reduction without 
experiencing a dose limiting toxicity, encorafenib 300mg QD was declared to be the RP2D. BID dosing was 
explored briefly but stopped due to poor tolerability. 
Table 24: 
Summary of best overall response by patient and treatment group (FAS, 
dose escalation phase) 
Encorafenib monotherapy showed clinical activity at the lowest dose of 50mg QD with wide 95% Cis [ORR= 
75% (95%-CI: 19.4; 99.4)].   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018

Phase 1b/ 2 Study CMEK162X2110 tested encorafenib at doses up to 800mg QD with binimetinib 45mg 
BID (the RP2D). The MTD was not reached and 2 RP2Ds of encorafenib were declared (450mg & 600mg QD). 
Patients on 600mg encorafenib plus binimetinib experienced increased serum creatinine so all patients were 
started on or switched to encorafenib 450mg QD.  
The Phase 3 doses were based on maximum tolerability with the hypothesis that higher doses might prevent 
the emergence of resistance or prolong the duration of tumour response.

Treatments 
Encorafenib was supplied as 50mg and 100mg capsules (the MAA is for 50mg and 75mg capsules). Patients 
were not to have eaten anything for 2 hours before and 1 hour after the morning dose of study drug. 
Patients received study treatment until progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1 as determined by the 
blinded independent review committee (BIRC), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, physician 
decision or early termination of the study. 
The permitted dose reduction levels for encorafenib were 300 mg, 200 mg, 100 mg and 50 mg QD with 
specific recommendations regarding eye disorders, CK elevation, decreased LVEF, QTc prolongation, skin, 
gastrointestinal and liver-related AEs. Dose re-escalation was permitted if toxicity improved to ≤ Grade 1, 
except for QT prolongation (QTcF >500msec). A patient in the Combo 450 arm who permanently 
discontinued binimetinib could continue encorafenib monotherapy but, if encorafenib was permanently 
discontinued, then binimetinib had to be discontinued due to its limited efficacy in monotherapy.  Patients 
requiring treatment interruption >28 days were to be permanently discontinued. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  whether  treatment  with  Combo  450  prolongs  progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared with vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600 mutant locally advanced unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma. This was addressed by Part 1 of the study. 
The  key  secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  the  contribution  of  binimetinib  to  the  combination  by 
comparing  the  PFS  of  Combo  450  vs.  encorafenib  (Part  1)  and  to  further  quantify  the  contribution  of 
binimetinib to the combination by comparing the PFS of Combo 300 vs. encorafenib (Part 2). 
Other secondary objectives included: 
Part  1  only  –  to  compare  the  treatment  effect  of  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  in  terms  of  overall  survival 
(OS); to estimate the treatment effect of combo 450 vs. encorafenib in terms of OS; to determine the safety 
and tolerability of Combo 450 and encorafenib in this patient population 
Assessment report

Page 64/171 
  
  
Part 2 only- to estimate the safety and tolerability of combo 300 vs. encorafenib in this patient population; to 
estimate the safety and tolerability of Combo 300 vs. Combo 450 in this patient population; to estimate the 
treatment  effect  of  Combo  300  vs.  encorafenib  in  terms  of  OS;  to  estimate  the  treatment  effect  of  Combo 
300 vs. vemurafenib in terms of PFS and OS; to estimate the treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. Combo 450 
in terms of PFS and OS. 
Parts  1  &  2-  to  estimate  the  treatment  effect  of  encorafenib  vs.  vemurafenib  in  terms  of  PFS  and  OS;  to 
assess  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  by  treatment  arms;  to  describe  time  to  response  (TTR);  to  assess 
disease  control  rate  (DCR);  to  evaluate  duration  of  response  (DOR);  to  compare  the  patient-reported 
outcomes  (PROs)  and  the  ECOG  PS  between  the  treatment  arms  and  to  characterise  the  PK  of  encorafenib 
and binimetinib in this patient population.  
Exploratory objectives included: 
Part  1-  to  assess  whether  the  BRAF  mutation  status  in  circulating  tumour  DNA  correlates  with  the  BRAF 
mutation status in tumour tissue 
Parts 1 & 2- to explore baseline molecular status of genes relevant to RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling 
in  tumour  tissue  and  their  potential  correlation  to  efficacy  outcomes  and  to  explore  potential  markers  of 
acquired resistance to encorafenib and encorafenib plus binimetinib 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to 
the date of the first documented progression based on tumour assessment read centrally by a BICR according 
to  RECIST  v1.1  criteria,  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first.  If  a  patient  did  not  have  an 
event at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored 
at  the  date  of  the  last  adequate  tumour  assessment.  If  a  patient  discontinued  treatment  for  “disease 
progression”,  without  documented  evidence  of  progression  based  on  RECIST  v1.1,  it  was  not  to  be 
considered as a PFS event. 
The key secondary for Part 1 was PFS per BIRC on Combo 450 vs. Enco 300. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  OS (time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause);  
•  ORR  (proportion  of  patients  with  a  best  overall  response  of  CR  or  PR,  calculated  for  confirmed  and 
unconfirmed responses separately);  
• 
TTR (time from date of randomization until first documented CR or PR);  
•  DCR (proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease);  
•  DOR (time from the date of first documented CR or PR to the first documented progression or death 
due to underlying cancer) and  
• 
the  PROs  i.e.  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  Melanoma  [FACT-M]  v  4,  European 
Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire  Core  30  [EORTC 
QLQ-C30]  v  3.0  and  EuroQoL-5D-5  Level  (EQ-5D-5L]  v  4.0.  The  main  PRO  endpoints  were  time  to 
definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M melanoma subscale and global health status score of the 
Assessment report

EORTC  QLQ-C30;  change  from  baseline  in  the  FACT-M  melanoma  subscale,  EQ-5D-5L,  and  global 
health  status  score  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30;  change  from  baseline  in  the  other  EORTC  QLQ-C30 
subscales. 
Efficacy and PROs were assessed every 8 weeks until week 105 and every 12 weeks thereafter until 
progression or end of treatment. Patients were then followed every 12 weeks for survival and use of 
subsequent anticancer therapy. Safety was assessed every 4 weeks. Patients in the combination arms 
had an ophthalmic exam at the start of each treatment cycle and pre- and post-dose PK samples. 
Sample size 
For the vemurafenib arm, a median PFS of 7 months was assumed based on results from studies in 
previously untreated patients and patients who progressed after at least one prior systemic treatment were 
studied, respectively, where the median PFS values were 6.9 and 6.8 months, respectively.  
Based on the dose-escalation results and the dose-expansion results of the Clinical Study CLGX818X2101, 
the observed median for patients treated with encorafenib was 7.1 months (95% CI 3.7, 14.7) and 7.4 
months (95% CI 7.4, not estimable [NE]), respectively. In this less advanced patient population, the median 
PFS was therefore expected to be around 8 months. 
Based on results from Clinical Study CMEK162X2110, Combo 450 was expected to result in a 42% reduction 
in hazard rate compared to vemurafenib (corresponding to an increase in median from 7 months to 12 
months). 
The observed benefit with Combo 300 was expected to be lower than with Combo 450. The median PFS was 
therefore anticipated to be around 11 months. 
In study Part 1, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Combo 450, encorafenib or 
vemurafenib. The sample size driver for study Part 1 was the Combo 450 vs. encorafenib comparison. For the 
comparison of Combo 450 vs. encorafenib, 191 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 0.667 with an 
80% power using a log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. For the Part 1 primary 
comparison, Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib, 145 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 0.58 with a 90% 
power using a log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. 
A total of 576 patients (192 patients in each arm) were planned to be recruited in Part 1 over around 15 
months, accounting for 15% loss to follow-up. The primary analysis was to be performed when a sufficient 
number of PFS events for both the primary and key secondary comparisons were available, which was 
expected to occur around 22 months after first treatment of the first patient. 
In Part 2, the new Combo 300 arm was added. The data already collected in Part 1 for the encorafenib arm 
represented a considerable amount of information; therefore, the randomization ratio for Combo 300 to 
encorafenib in Part 2 was 3:1.  
Considering a 3:1 randomization ratio in the second part of the study and aiming for a similar number of 
patients in the Combo 300 and the encorafenib arm (combining Part 1 and 2), 320 additional patients were to 
be randomized (80 in the encorafenib arm and 240 in the Combo 300 arm). 
The Part 2 PFS Analysis was to be performed when approximately 340 PFS events had occurred in total in the 
encorafenib (both parts) and Combo 300 arms. Based on the differential follow-up and expected median PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 66/171 
  
  
 
times, it was expected that approximately 330 of these events would contribute to the HR estimate and log-
rank test, and would result in approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.727 (8/11) at a one-sided 2.5% 
level of significance. This was anticipated to occur approximatively 37 months after first treatment of the first 
patient. 
Randomisation 
In Part 1, approximately 576 patients were to be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment arms.  
Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage (IIIB + IIIC + IVM1a + IVM1b vs. IVM1c); ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), 
BRAF mutation status (V600E vs. V600K) and prior first-line immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic 
disease (yes vs. no). 
Prior first line immunotherapy (yes vs. no) added with Protocol Amendment 2 (post enrolment of 2 patients), 
when inclusion of this patient group was allowed. 
BRAF mutation status (V600E vs. V600K) was removed as a stratification factor with Protocol Amendment 2, 
as the V600K stratum was expected to be very small. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. However, blinded tumour assessment data read centrally by a BIRC were used in 
the primary efficacy analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined according to the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) principle, and consisted of 
all randomized patients. Following the ITT principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment and 
stratification factors they were assigned to at randomization. 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) consisted of all patients from the FAS without any major protocol deviations and 
who received at least one dose of study medication. 
The Safety Set included all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication and had at least 
one valid post-baseline safety evaluation. Patients were analyzed according to the study treatment they 
actually received. 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of 
encorafenib or binimetinib and had at least one evaluable post-baseline encorafenib or binimetinib 
concentration measurement. The same definition applied to the Japanese subgroup. 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy comparisons were based on PFS, defined as the time from the date 
of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurred first. Censoring rules to be applied to the PFS endpoint are described in the following table.

Page 67/171 
  
  
 
Table 25: 
Censoring rules to be applied to the progression-free survival analysis 
Blinded tumor assessment data read centrally by a BIRC were used in the primary efficacy analysis. The local 
Investigator’s assessments were used in a supportive analysis of PFS. 
The primary analysis was the comparison of the distribution of PFS between Combo 450 and vemurafenib 
using a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 2.5% cumulative level of significance. 
The null and the alternative hypothesis were defined as follows: 
in the control arm (i.e. vemurafenib) and SC450(t) is the survival distribution function of PFS in the 
experimental arm (i.e. Combo 450). 
where Svem(t) is the survival distribution function of PFS 
Progression-free survival was analyzed based on the data from the FAS according to the treatment arm and 2 
of the stratification factors (cancer stage and ECOG PS) patients were randomized to. Due to the relatively 
low expected prevalence of patients with prior immunotherapy (around 15%), the 2 prior immunotherapy 
strata (yes and no) were combined at the time of the analysis to avoid small or empty strata. The same 
principle applied to all stratified tests and models in this study. 
The distribution of PFS was described in tabular and graphical format by treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier 
methods, reporting estimated median (in months) with 95% confidence interval (CI), 25th and 75th 
percentiles and Kaplan-Meier estimated probabilities with corresponding 95% CIs at several time points 
(including at least 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months). 
A Cox regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors was used to estimate the HR of PFS, 
along with 95% CI based on the Wald test. 
To control type I error, a hierarchical testing procedure was used and the secondary endpoint of OS Combo 
450  vs  vemurafenib  was  to  be  tested  only  if  the  primary  and  key  secondary  PFS  comparisons  were 
statistically significant.

Data cut-off for Part 1 was to take place once the planned number of patients had been randomised to Part 1 
(i.e.  576  patients)  and  sufficient  PFS  events  were  available  for  the  final  primary  and  Part  1  key  secondary 
comparison  (i.e.145  PFS  events  for  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  and  191  PFS  events  for  Combo  450  vs. 
encorafenib).  The  analysis  was  performed  at  204  PFS  events  for  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  and  223  PFS 
events for Combo 450 vs. Enco 300.

Overall  survival  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  death  due  to  any 
cause. If a death was not observed by the date of analysis cutoff, OS was to be censored at the date of last 
contact. Survival time for patients with no post-baseline survival information was to be censored on the date 
of  randomization.  For  analysis  of  OS,  a  group  sequential  design  with  one  interim  analysis  (at  time  of  PFS 
analysis (Part 2)) was planned to be used. To maintain the overall type-I error rate for the trial, the type-1 
error rate was based on a α-spending function using a Gamma function with parameter 1. At the time of the 
Primary PFS Analysis (Part 1), no formal testing of OS was performed in order to preserve Sponsor blinding 
to OS and maintain the integrity of the planned first interim analysis. 
Secondary efficacy variables were analyzed in the FAS and were to include ORR, TTR, DCR, DOR and PROs.  
The BIRC assessments were used for the main analyses of best overall response (BOR), ORR, TTR, DCR and 
DOR.  ORR  and  DCR  were  presented  by  treatment  arm  along  with  exact  95%  CI  using  the  Clopper-Pearson 
method. 
Time to response and duration of response were descriptively analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The  change  in  tumor  size  was  to  be  depicted  using  waterfall  plots  presenting  the  best  percentage  change 
from baseline in the sum of the diameter of all target lesions. These plots were to display the best percentage 
change from baseline in the sum of the diameter of all target lesions for each patient. 
Health-related  QoL  data  were  collected  via  PROs.  The  FACT-M,  EQ-5D-5L  and  EORTC  QLQ-C30  patient 
questionnaires  were  used  in  this  study.  Health-related  QoL  data  were  analyzed  using  the  FAS.  The  FACT-M 
melanoma subscale, index score of EQ-5D-5L and the global health status/QoL score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
were  identified  as  the  primary  PRO  variables  of  interest.  Physical  functioning,  emotional  functioning  and 
social functioning scale scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were considered as secondary.

The  primary  PRO  analysis  was  to  assess  the  difference  in  distribution  of  the  time  to  definitive  10% 
deterioration  in  the  FACT-M  subscale  among  the  treatment  arms  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS).  Only 
assessments collected while the patient was on treatment and at the EOT visit were included.

Recruitment 
Patients were randomised at 162 sites in 28 countries; 20 sites in North America, 124 sites in Europe and 18 
sites in selected countries from the rest of the world. A small number were enrolled per site so data from all 
sites were pooled.

Conduct of the study 
The proportion of patients with at least one protocol deviation was similar among the 3 treatment arms 
(62.0% Combo 450, 66.0% encorafenib, 64.4% vemurafenib arm). Most protocol deviations were due to key 
procedures not performed as per protocol (48.4% Combo 450, 52.6% encorafenib, 54.5% vemurafenib arm). 
Deviations due to eligibility criteria not met were reported in each treatment arm (8.9% Combo 450 arm, 
10.8% encorafenib arm, 4.7% vemurafenib arm). 
There were 4 amendments to the original study protocol (dated 13 May 2013). 
Version 1, Amendment 1 (3 October 2013) was issued before any patients were randomised and included 
clarification that patients known to be NRAS mutation positive should not be selected for pre-screening. 
Version 2, Amendment 2 (20 December 2013) after 2 patients had been randomised allowed inclusion of 
patients progressing on or after first line immunotherapy.  
Version 3, Amendment 3 (4 November 2014) was issued when 364 patients had been randomised. Part 2 
was added. Consequently, allocation to Part 1 was reduced, the primary objective of analysis of PFS of 
encorafenib monotherapy vs. vemurafenib was changed to a secondary endpoint and the key secondary 
endpoint of overall survival for Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib was changed to a secondary endpoint to be 
tested hierarchically after the Part 2 key secondary endpoint.  
Version 4, Amendment 4 (13 Jul 2015), documented a change in study sponsorship.  
At the time of the primary PFS analysis (data cut-off 19 May 2016), the required number of survival events 
had not occurred for analysis of overall survival (OS). On 14 October 2016, the DMC reviewed un-blinded 
data from Part 1 (data cut-off 19 May 2016) and un-blinded survival data, to which the Sponsor (Array) and 
Pierre Fabre remained blinded. The DMC recommended the following: 
• 
• 
Terminate the planned analyses and inform all patients (in Parts 1 and 2) of the Part 1 results. 
Inform patients in the vemurafenib arm that a combination of commercially available BRAF and MEK 
inhibitors may be a better alternative regimen. 
There were no specific recommendations regarding the encorafenib monotherapy arm. The decision to 
continue encorafenib monotherapy or change to a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination was to be based on a 
discussion between the patient and physician. 
To minimise the delay in the timing of the OS interim analysis, the applicant proposed that the protocol be 
amended to de-couple the Part 1 OS analysis from the primary Part 2 PFS analysis. The timing of the Part 1 
OS analysis became event driven; the interim OS data was submitted with the response to the D120 list of 
questions.  
Per Protocol Amendment 5.0, two OS analyses of Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib were planned based on the 
number of OS events in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms combined:  
Part 1 OS Interim Analysis: The primary OS analysis was to be performed when approximately 232 OS 
events were observed  
Final OS Update: to be performed when approximately 309 OS events were observed  
The data cut-off date for this Part 1 OS interim analysis was 7 November 2017, by which time a total of 232 
OS events were observed in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms combined in Part 1 of the study.

The median age of patients was 56 years (range 20¬-89), 58% were male, 90% were Caucasian, and 72% 
of patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients had metastatic disease (95%) and 
were Stage IVM1c (64%); 27% of patients had elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and 
45% of patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline and 3.5% had brain metastases. 
27 patients (5%) had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1/PDL1 or ipilimumab) (8 patients in 
Combo 450 arm (4%); 7 patients in vemurafenib arm (4%); 12 patients in Enco 300 arm (6%) including 22

Twenty-one patients (3.6%) were excluded from the PPS (4 patients [2.1%] Combo 450, 10 patients [5.2%] 
encorafenib, 7 patients [3.7%] vemurafenib). The most common reasons were that patients did not receive 
at least one dose of study medication or new anti-neoplastic therapy was administered after the start of 
study treatment and prior to first tumour assessment.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint: PFS based on BIRC review in the FAS 
PFS for the Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib alone was 14.9 vs. 7.3 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.54 (95% 
CI 0.41, 0.71, 1 sided stratified log rank p<0.001). No imputations were used for the start or end dates for 
the primary PFS analysis.

Figure 14:  Kaplan-Meier Estimate of PFS Based on BIRC – Combo 450 vs. Vemurafenib 
(FAS, Part1) 
The  median  PFS  values  based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  14.8  months  (95%  CI  10.4,  18.4)  and  7.3 
months (95% CI 5.7, 8.5) for the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms, respectively (HR of 0.49, 95% CI 0.37, 
0.64; nominal p < 0.001). 
Median follow-up time for PFS per BIRC was 16.7 months for the Combo 450 arm and 14.4 months for the 
vemurafenib arm. Just under half of the patients were censored for the primary PFS analyis, most prior to the 
median PFS in each arm. The most common reason for censoring in the Combo 450 and encorafenib arms 
was because patients remained on treatment (29.7% and 24.2%, respectively), whilst in the vemurafenib 
arm it was because patients had started a new cancer therapy (19.9%).

Sensitivity analyses 
The median PFS by investigator assessment was similar to the BIRC result: 14.8 months (95% CI 10.4, 18.4) 
vs. 7.3 months (95% CI 5.7, 8.5) for the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms, respectively, with a HR of 0.49 
(95% CI 0.37, 0.64; nominal p < 0.001). In general, there was agreement regarding the type of event (PD/ 
death) between the Investigator and BIRC. There was discordance regarding the timing of the PD event in 
about 30% of cases, with no evidence of bias between the arms.  
The results in the per protocol set (PPS) by BIRC were reflective of the primary analysis. The median PFS was 
15.5 months (95% CI, 11.0, 18.7) in the Combo 450 arm and 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.6, 8.3) in the 
vemurafenib arm (HR =0.53; 95% CI, 0.40, 0.70; nominal p < 0.001). 
Results of additional sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC were consistent with the primary PFS analysis, 
yielding similar HRs (0.53 – 0.56), median PFS values and p values.

PFS Combo 450 vs. Encorafenib 
In  Part  1,  the  median  PFS  was  14.9  months  (11.0,  18.5)  and  9.6  months  (7.5,  14.8)  for  Combo  450  and 
encorafenib respectively (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56, 1.00). The PFS difference was not statistically significant (p 
=  0.0256)  by  the  one-sided  stratified  log-rank  test according  to the  threshold  of  p  <  0.025.  Approximately 
half  the  patients  in  each  arm  had  a  PFS  event  (98  patients  [51.0%]  Combo  450;  96  patients  [49.5%] 
encorafenib).  The  median  follow-up  time  for  PFS  per  BIRC  was  16.7  months  for  the  Combo  450  and  16.6 
months for the encorafenib arm. 
An updated PFS analysis performed on 07 November 2017 gave a similar result (median PFS: Combo 450 vs 
encorafenib 14.9 vs 9.6 months, HR: 0.77 (95% CI [0.59-1]), one sided nominal p value=0.0249).

Per Investigator assessment of response, the median PFS estimates were 14.8 months (95% CI 10.4, 18.4) 
and 9.2 months (95% CI 7.4, 12.9) in the Combo 450 and encorafenib arms, respectively (HR 0.68; 95% CI 
0.52, 0.90; nominal p = 0.003). Approximately half the patients in each arm had a PFS event (102 [53.1%] 
Combo 450; 108 [55.7%] encorafenib). 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC using data from the FAS were conducted as per the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  
The HR for PFS of Combo 450 vs. encorafenib using unstratified log-rank and Cox regression tests was 0.81 
(95% CI 0.61, 1.07; nominal p = 0.0714).

Overall 103 out of the 577 (17.9%) patients randomised in the CMEK162B2301 study changed therapy 
before progression. Of these 103, 44 (42.7%) were followed until progression or death (death as first event, 
all due to study indication): 9 (37.5%), 14 (42.4%) and 21 (45.7%) in the Combo 450, Enco 300 and 
vemurafenib arms respectively.

To fufil the EMA guidelines definition, three additional sensitivity analyses were performed as requested 
during the procedure. These supported the results of the initial analysis with regards to Combo 450 vs 
vemurafenib (primary objective) and Combo 450 vs encorafenib 300mg QD (key secondary objective).

PFS, Encorafenib vs. Vemurafenib  
Analysis of the PFS by BIRC of encorafenib vs. vemurafenib treatment showed a difference of approximately 
2.3 months (9.6 months vs. 7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 
0.90). Investigator assessment of response gave similar PFS durations (encorafenib 9.2 months, vemurafenib 
7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.90). Median PFS values by 
BIRC were the same in the PPS as in the FAS.

e The 95% CI for the frequency distribution of each variable were computed using Clopper-Pearson's method. 
f Unknown response: Not included in BOR assessment but included in denominator for ORR and DCR. Progression

method than baseline. See Table 14.2-3.2a for reasons for unknown status. 
g Not included in BOR assessment but included in denominator for ORR and DCR. No assessment has occurred by 
BIRC; not included in patients with measurable or non-measurable disease at baseline. 
Median time to objective response (TTR) per BIRC, calculated for responding patients only (confirmation 
not required), was 1.9 months in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 1.9, 1.9), 2.0 months in the encorafenib arm 
(95% CI 1.9, 3.6) and 2.1 months in the vemurafenib arm (95% CI 1.9, 3.7). Median TTR per Investigator 
assessment  was  also  approximately  2  months  for  each  arm.  This  timing  corresponded  with  the  first  post-
baseline response assessment at Cycle 3 Day 1. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median duration of response (DOR) per BIRC, calculated for confirmed responses, 
were 16.6 months in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 12.2, 20.4; range 1.64 – 22.11), 14.9 months in the 
encorafenib arm (95% CI 11.1, NE; range 0.62 – 15.47) and 12.3 months in the vemurafenib arm (95% CI 
6.9, 16.9; range 0.92 – 16.89). 
Investigator review revealed a similar pattern but a higher ORR in each arm (75.0 % [95% CI 68.3, 81.0]; 
57.7% [95% CI 50.4, 64.8]; 49.2 % [95% CI 41.9, 56.5], respectively).  
The confirmed CR by Investigator review was higher than by BIRC (16.1%, 8.8% and 7.3% of patients in the 
Combo 450, encorafenib and vemurafenib arms, respectively) and their median time to CR was 5.5 months, 
5.5 months and 3.9 months, respectively. 
The DCR per Investigator review was similar to per BIRC.  
Median TTR per Investigator assessment was also approximately 2 months for each arm. This timing 
corresponded with the first post-baseline response assessment at Cycle 3 Day 1. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median DOR per Investigator, calculated for confirmed responses, were similar to 
those by BIRC: 16.2 months, 14.8 months and 8.4 months in the Combo 450, encorafenib and vemurafenib 
arms. 
Overall Survival, Combo 450 vs. Vemurafenib  
As of the data cut-off (7 November 2017), 80 patients (13.9%) were ongoing in the treatment period of the 
study (22.4% Combo 450 arm, 12.4% encorafenib arm, 6.8% vemurafenib arm). The median duration of 
exposure to study treatment in the Combo 450 arm (11.8 months) was longer than in the encorafenib (7.2 
months) and vemurafenib (6.1 months) arms. Within the Combo 450 arm, median durations of exposure to 
encorafenib and binimetinib were identical (11.8 months). 
The most common reason for discontinuation from study treatment, in all arms, was progressive disease and 
the rate was higher in the vemurafenib arm (57.1%) as compared with the Combo 450 (51.6%) and 
encorafenib (51.5%) arms. The rates of withdrawal by physician and by patients were higher for vemurafenib 
(8.9% each) and encorafenib (12.4% and 8.8%) vs Combo 450 (4.7% and 5.7%). The proportion of patients 
censored for this OS analysis in the Combo 450 arm (45.3%) was higher than that observed in the 
vemurafenib arm (33.5%). Most censored patients in both groups who were alive and ongoing had a last 
contact within the 12 weeks prior to data cut-off. 
For all randomized patients, the median time between randomisation and OS cut-off dates was 37.45 months 
[30.98–46.29 months]. When measured as the time from randomisation until event/censoring, the median

potential follow-up duration using reverse Kaplan Meier for OS was 37.2 months in the Combo 450 arm, 36.3 
months in the encorafenib arm and 35.9 months in the vemurafenib arm.  
A lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm (41.7%) received antineoplastic therapy after 
discontinuation of study treatment compared with the encorafenib (55.7%) and vemurafenib (62.3%) arms, 
partly due to a higher proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm who continued to receive study treatment 
as of the data cut-off. A similar proportion of patients in each arm received subsequent treatment with a 
monoclonal antibody, mainly checkpoint inhibitors (34.4% Combo 450, 36.1% encorafenib, 39.8% 
vemurafenib arm). A lower proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm (10.9%) received subsequent 
treatment with BRAF inhibitors and/or combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors after discontinuation of study 
treatment as compared with either the encorafenib (21.6 %) or the vemurafenib (32.9%) arms. 
Figure 18:  Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival, Combo 450 vs. Vemurafenib (Full 
Analysis Set, Part 1) 
An estimated 39% reduction in the risk of death was observed for patients treated with Combo 450 compared 
to those treated with vemurafenib (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47, 0.79), with median OS values of 33.6 months 
(95% CI 24.4, 39.2) and 16.9 months (95% CI 14.0, 24.5), respectively.  
Estimates of OS at 12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (95% CI 68.8, 81.0) and 57.6% (95% CI 50.3, 
64.3) for Combo 450 compared to 63.1% (95% CI 55.7, 69.6) and 43.2% (95% CI 35.9, 50.2) for 
vemurafenib. 
The results of sensitivity analyses are consistent with those of the interim OS analysis and lead to similar 
conclusions about treatment effect.

Health related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Analyses 
Patient  compliance  with  the  3  QoL  instruments  (FACT-M,  EORTC-QLQ-C30,  EQ-5D-5L)  was  calculated  for 
patients still “at-risk” i.e.  receiving treatment or in post-treatment follow-up on the protocol-scheduled PRO 
assessment  date.  Compliance  with  the  3  questionnaires  was  equivalent  among  the  3  treatment  arms,  with 
approximately 80%-95% of patients still at risk completing the assessment from baseline to Cycle 25.  
At baseline, the mean [SD] FACT-M score was similar in the 3 treatment arms: Combo 450 (52.39 [9.05]), 
Enco  300  (52.84  [8.23])  and  vemurafenib  arm  (52.01  [8.65]).  The  median  time  to  definitive  10% 
deterioration in the FACT-M global health status score was not reached in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 22.1, 
NE)  and  was  22.1  months  (95%  CI  15.2,  NE)  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of  0.46 
(95% CI 0.29, 0.72) using a stratified Cox regression model. The median time to definitive 10% deterioration 
in  the  FACT-M  was  20.3  months  (95%  CI  15.0,  NE)  in  the  encorafenib  arm  with  a  HR  for  the  difference 
between Combo 450 and encorafenib of 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.75) using a stratified Cox regression model.

At  baseline,  the  mean  [SD]  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global  health  status  score  was  similar  in  the  3  treatment 
arms: Combo 450 (66.72 [21.59]), Enco 300 (66.10 [21.16]) and the vemurafenib arm (64.74 [23.61]). The 
median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status score was delayed by 
more than 7 months in the Combo 450 arm compared to the vemurafenib arm: 23.9 months (95% CI 20.4, 
NE)  vs.  16.6  months  (95%  CI  11.9,  NE)  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of  0.55  (95%  CI  0.37,  0.80)  using  a 
stratified  Cox  regression  model.  The  median  time  to  definitive  10%  deterioration  in  the  QLQ-C30  global 
health status scores was longer in the Combo 450 arm compared with the Enco 300 arm (14.7 months [95% 
CI  9.2,  18.4]),  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of  0.45  (95%  CI  0.31,  0.65)  using  a  stratified  Cox  regression 
model.  
At  baseline,  the  mean  EQ-5D-5L  index  score  was  similar  for  each  arm  (Combo  450  =  0.74,  encorafenib  = 
0.76, vemurafenib = 0.73) and the median was 0.77 for each of the 3 treatment arms. The Combo 450 arm 
showed  a  slight  improvement  at  Cycle  3  Day  1  from  baseline  and  the  vemurafenib  showed  no  change.  In 
subsequent visits, the scores decreased over time for both arms. Comparison of the Combo 450 arm vs. the 
encorafenib arm showed similar results to the comparison of the Combo 450 arm and vemurafenib arm.  
Study CMEK162B2301 PART 2 
The main objective of Part 2 (a key secondary objective) was to further quantify the contribution of 
binimetinib to the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib, by comparing PFS of Combo 300 (encorafenib 
300 mg QD and binimetinib 45 mg BID) vs. encorafenib single-agent (encorafenib 300 mg QD).  
Approximately 320 patients were planned to be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to Combo 300: Enco 300. The 
inclusion – exclusion criteria were identical to Part 1.

Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses in the Part 2 CSR (Combo 300 vs. Enco 300)  
An unplanned initial analysis of Part 2 based on 293 events (vs 340 events planned) was performed using a 
data cut-off date of 09 November 2016 in agreement with the FDA. Analysis of the Part 1 key secondary 
endpoint (PFS, Combo 450 vs. encorafenib) was not statistically significant; therefore, per protocol-specified 
testing hierarchy, the data in this PFS part 2 analysis are summarized descriptively without formal testing. 
As pre-specified, (SAP version IV), the Part 2 initial CSR reports data from the combined Part 1 and Part 2 
encorafenib monotherapy patients (N=280) and Part 2 encorafenib monotherapy patients only (N=86) 
through to the cut-off date for the Part 2 report.  
All efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set (FAS).  
Results 
Part 2 patients were randomised between 19 March 2015 and 12 November 2015. A total of 344 patients 
were randomised during Part 2, 258 patients in the Combo 300 arm and 86 in the encorafenib arm.  
Figure 24: Patient flow chart for Part 2 of study CMEK162B2301 
The two treatment groups (Combo 300 and Enco 300 [Parts 1 + 2]) were reasonably well balanced in terms 
of baseline and disease characteristics.  As would be expected because these were directly randomised 
groups, the Combo 300 and Enco 300 Part 2 populations were similar at baseline.

However, there were some differences between the two encorafenib monotherapy arms (Part 1 and Part 2). 
Patients in the encorafenib Part 2 arm were older (median age 57 years, 30.2% were ≥ 65 years old) than 
those in the encorafenib Part 1 arm (median age 54 years, 20.6% were ≥ 65 years old). The proportion of 
patients with Stage IV M1C with elevated LDH was higher in the Enco 300 Part 2 arm compared with Enco 
300 Part 1 (37.2% vs. 25.8%). More Enco 300 Part 1 patients had Stage IV M1B (20.1% vs 11.6%), and 
Stage IV M1C with normal LDH (36.1% vs 30.2% respectively). A difference was seen in the overall duration 
of disease with a median time from initial diagnosis to randomisation that was nearly 5 months longer in the 
Enco 300 Part 2 population (28.4 vs 23.6 months). Distribution of disease location was similar between 
combinations for skin and/or lymph nodes; however more Enco 300 Part 1 patients had lung metastases 
(19.6% vs 8.1% respectively), while more patients in Enco 300 Part 2 had other organs involved. Baseline 
LDH levels were higher in Enco 300 Part 2 patients, with a mean of 338 U/L vs 265 UI/L and a median of 217 
U/L vs 189 U/L vs respectively.

Combo 300 vs Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) 
The median follow-up for PFS per BIRC (Kaplan-Meier) was 13.9 months for the Combo 300 arm and 18.5 
months for the encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) group.  
For the primary analysis of Part 2 the PFS in the Combo 300 arm was 3.7 months longer than that of the 
encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) group, with median PFS estimates of 12.9 months (95% CI 10.1, 14.0) and 9.2 
months (95% CI 7.4, 11.0), respectively (HR=0.77, 95% CI 0.61, 0.97; nominal one-sided p=0.015).

Figure 25:  Kaplan-Meier Estimate of PFS Based on BIRC – Combo 300 vs. Enco 300 
(Part 1 and 2) 
The analysis was supported by the sensitivity analysis of the Investigator assessment (HR=0.72, 95% CI: 
0.57, 0.91; nominal p=0.003), which had the same median PFS values as those by BIRC at 12.9 months 
(95% CI: 10.9, 14.8) and 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.1) for the Combo 300 arm and the encorafenib (Parts 
1 + 2) group.  
Sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC were conducted: per protocol, unstratified, actual event, backdating and 
further anticancer therapy yielded similar HRs (0.75 – 0.78).  
Most subgroup analyses of PFS per BIRC demonstrated point estimates in favour of the Combo 300 arm. In 
the 3 subgroups for which point estimates were in favour of the encorafenib (Parts 1 +2) group (BRAF V600K 
mutation status, AJCC stage IIIb-IVM1B and one organ involved at baseline), all had large 95% CIs which 
overlapped with the other subgroup of the respective category.  
The confirmed ORR per BIRC in the Combo 300 arm was 65.9% (95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) compared with 50.4% 
(95% CI 44.3, 56.4) in the Enco 300 (Parts 1 + 2) group. Responses were of similar duration with a median 
DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC of one year in each treatment group (Combo 300 arm=12.7 months 
[95% CI: 9.3, 15.1]; encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) group=12.9 months [95% CI 8.9, 15.5].  
The ORR per Investigator review was higher in both the Combo 300 arm and the encorafenib (Parts 1 + 2) 
group than by BIRC, with the difference in favour of Combo 300 maintained (72.5% Combo 300 arm, 56.4% 
Enco 300 [Parts 1 + 2] group). Median DORs per Investigator were approximately 13 months in each 
treatment group.

PFS including only the encorafenib monotherapy patients who were concurrently randomised in Part 2 was 
conducted as a sensitivity analysis as per protocol. The median follow-up for PFS per BIRC (Kaplan-Meier) 
was 13.9 months for the Combo 300 arm and 14.8 months for the encorafenib Part 2 arm.  
In patients randomised concurrently in Part 2 of the study, there was an estimated 43% risk reduction in 
BIRC-assessed PFS in the Combo 300 arm (N=258) compared to the encorafenib monotherapy arm (N=86); 
HR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78; nominal stratified one-sided log-rank p<0.001. Median PFS was 12.9 months 
(95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) and 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2), respectively. 
Figure 26:  Kaplan-Meier Estimate of PFS Based on BIRC – Combo 300 vs. Enco 300 
[Part 2] (FAS, Part 2 Initial) 
The effect of treatment on PFS was estimated using a non-adjusted regression analysis, stratified by the 
study randomisation stratification factors (ECOG and disease stage). The crude HR was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.42, 
0.79). 
The four Propensity Score approaches including stratification (3 and 5 strata), matching, and IPW showed a 
benefit of Combo 300 over Enco 300 Part 2. HRs ranged from 0.52 to 0.70 (upper 95% cI 0.80 to 1.00). 
PFS by BIRC – Encorafenib 300 Part 1  vs. Encorafenib 300  Part 2  
Results of the prespecified sensitivity analysis of PFS by BIRC for the encorafenib arm (Part 1) vs. 
encorafenib arm (Part 2) showed an estimated 32% risk reduction in the encorafenib (Part 1) arm (HR 0.68; 
95% CI: 0.49, 0.95; nominal one-sided p=0.013). The median PFS times of the encorafenib Part 1 arm vs. 
Part 2 arm were 9.6 months (95% CI: 7.4, 14.8) and 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2), respectively.

(Full Analysis Set, Part 2 Initial) 
PFS analyses of Enco 300 Part 1 vs Part 2, adjusted for confounding factors in the context of two independent 
cohorts, were conducted using the propensity score (PS) test. However, the PS is normally used for the 
description of populations accrued at a similar time point, whereas Enco 300 populations were recruited 
sequentially in Parts 1 and 2. The model cannot account for the potential bias introduced by this temporal 
difference.

Four PS approaches including stratification (3 and 5 strata), matching, and IPW were then used to estimate 
the treatment effect on PFS and were adjusted for confounding. The different PS methods (adjusted and non-
adjusted) gave HRs ranging from 0.57 to 0.68 and all showed a significant increase in the risk of disease 
progression or death for Enco 300 in Part 2 over Enco 300 in Part 1. 
Contribution of binimetinib 45 mg BID to the efficacy of Combo 450: Combo 450 vs. Combo 300 
A post hoc comparison of data from the Combo 450 arm [Part 1 of CMEK162B2301 (N=192) at the cut-off 
date for the primary analysis of 19 May 2016] and the Combo 300 arm [Part 2 (N=258) unplanned initial 
analysis at the cut-off date of 09 November 2016] was conducted. The two data cut-offs were chosen to 
allow similar duration of follow up, as the populations were not recruited concomitantly. Median potential 
follow-up for PFS was comparable for the two populations (16.7 months vs 13.9 months) and the median 
follow-up time was 9.3 months for both combinations. A supportive analysis was performed using the 09 
November 2016 for the two arms. 
The Combo 450 and Combo 300 populations were similar in terms of age, sex, race and ECOG performance 
status. A slightly higher proportion of patients was enrolled in Europe, North America and Australia in Combo 
450 compared to Combo 300 (9.5% difference). Median time from initial diagnosis to onset of metastatic 
disease was longer in the Combo 450 than the Combo 300 population (15.0 vs 10.4 months). Distribution of 
disease location and disease burden were similar between combinations, although a higher proportion of 
patients had only one disease site in Combo 300 (30.2% vs 24.5% with Combo 450). Median LDH levels at 
baseline were slightly higher in Combo 300 (202 vs. 173 U/L). 
Median PFS (per BIRC) was 2 months longer for Combo 450 (14.9 months) than for Combo 300 (12.9 
months), but the difference was not statistically significant (log rank p value 0.0845).

Other efficacy parameters by BIRC showed similar results for the two combinations (ORR = 63.0% vs 65.9% 
and DCR = 92.2% vs 90.7%, respectively).  However, the duration of confirmed responses was longer for 
Combo 450 vs Combo 300 (16.6 months vs 12.7 months) which is aligned with the difference in PFS.  
Similar results were seen when comparing median PFS per Investigator (14.8 vs 12.9 months, respectively). 
ORRs per Investigator review were also similar, although higher (75.0% vs 72.5%). 
The analysis performed using the 09 November 2016 cut-off date for the two arms was supportive.

The effect of treatment on PFS was estimated using a non-adjusted regression analysis, stratified by the 
study stratification factors (ECOG and Stage). Then four PS approaches, including stratification (3 and 5 
strata), matching, and inverse probability weighting (IPW), were used to estimate the treatment effect on 
PFS and adjust for confounding factors. The different PS methods (adjusted and non-adjusted) gave similar 
results when comparing Combo 450 and Combo 300 for PFS, reaching an HR of 0.75 to 0.79, with an upper 
95% CI above 1 (1.01 to 1.09).

Supportive study: CLGX818X2109- LOGIC 2 
Study CLGX818X2109 (LOGIC 2) is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, 2-part Phase 2 study of sequential 
LGX818/MEK162  (encorafenib/binimetinib)  combination  followed  by  a  rational  combination  with  targeted 
agents  after  progression,  with  the  aim  of  overcoming  resistance  in  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic BRAF V600 melanoma. There was no control group. 
BRAF mutation was assessed from blood samples locally and from tumour samples (archival or fresh), both 
locally  and  centrally.  Eligibility  was  based  on  local  tumour  BRAF  mutation  results  and  included  all  V600 
mutations (e.g. V600E, K, D, L or R). 
Patients  were  to  be  ≥  18  years  of  age  with  AJCC  stage  IIIC  or  IV  melanoma,  measurable  disease  as 
determined by RECIST v1.1 and an ECOG PS of ≤2. Patients were to have no symptomatic brain metastases 
or symptomatic/ untreated leptomeningeal disease. No prior treatment was allowed with radiation therapy (> 
30%  of  the  bone  marrow  reserve),  chemotherapy,  biological  therapy  within  ≤  4  weeks  or  small  molecule 
therapeutics  or  investigational  agents  within  5-half-lives  prior  to  starting  study  drug.  Patients  had  to  have 
recovered from the side effects of prior therapy. 
In  Part  1,  patients  were  treated  with  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  of  encorafenib  450mg  QD  in 
combination  with  binimetinib  45  mg  BID  [Combo  450])  until  PD  (as  defined per  RECIST  v1.1)  or  no  clinical 
benefit. Three different patient populations were included: 
• Group A: Patients naïve to treatment with BRAF inhibitors  
• Group B: Patients who progressed after single-agent BRAF or MEK inhibitor or after combination BRAF and 
MEK  inhibitors  other  than  binimetinib/encorafenib  or  receiving  binimetinib  and/or  encorafenib,  who  had  not 
progressed yet or, in consultation with the Sponsor, who received any BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor other than 
binimetinib and/or encorafenib and had not progressed yet. 
• Group C: Patients who progressed after binimetinib/encorafenib combination therapy  
In Part 2, patients previously treated with binimetinib/encorafenib combination therapy and who relapsed on 
this therapy received tailored combination treatment with binimetinib/encorafenib and a third agent in one of 
four arms based on genetic assessment of a tumour biopsy obtained at disease progression. The four agents

were  BKM120  (PI3K  inhibitor),  BGJ398  (FGFR  inhibitor),  INC280  (cMET  inhibitor)  and  LEE011  (CDK  4/6 
inhibitor). 
No primary efficacy endpoint was defined for Part 1 as it was designed as a run-in stage for Part 2 to allow 
patients initially naïve to treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors (Group A) to meet the Part 2 eligibility criterion 
of being resistant to the MEK/BRAF inhibitor combination.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for Part 2 of the study was the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with 
a  best  overall  response  [BOR]  of  CR  or  PR  as  determined  by  the  Investigator  using  RECIST  v1.1.  The  key 
secondary endpoint was PFS with other secondary endpoints of DOR, TTR (time to response), DCR (disease 
control rate) and OS. Evaluations of ORR, PFS, DOR, TTR and DCR were also performed and analysed for Part 
1. The  CSR  for Part 1 presents data for Groups A,  B and  C but the  focus  here is on data from Group A i.e. 
BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitor-naïve  patients.  The  FAS  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
encorafenib or binimetinib and was used for the analysis of all endpoints unless noted otherwise. 
A total of 75 treatment-naïve patients were enrolled into Part 1 (Group A) of the study between 31 July 2014 
and  15  January  2016.  As  of  the  data  cut-off  (18  February  2016),  44  patients  (58.7%)  were  ongoing  with 
Combo 450 treatment. The most common reason for discontinuation from Combo 450 study treatment was 
PD (25.3%). As of the data cut-off, 13 patients (17.3%) had continued to Part 2 of the study.

Protocol  deviations  in  BRAF/MEK-treatment  naïve  patients  were  reported  for  28.0%  of  patients,  4.0%  were 
due to eligibility violations and 21.3% were assessment deviations. 
At data cut-off (18 February 2016), the median duration of exposure to study treatment for treatment naïve 
patients was 31.14 weeks (range, 3.86 to 80.57). The confirmed ORR per investigator was 69.3% (95% CI 
57.9,  79.5).  Most  patients  experienced  disease  improvement  or  control,  as  the  DCR  was  90.7%  (95%  CI

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study CMEK162B2301 (COLUMBUS) was a Phase 3, randomised, open label study comprising 2 
parts. The primary endpoint was PFS with Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib. The key secondary endpoint was PFS 
with  Combo  450  vs.  Enco  300  from  Part  1  (plus  PFS  Combo  300  vs.  Enco  300  from  Part  2).  With  the 
hierarchical  testing  procedure,  the  secondary  endpoint  of  OS  Combo  450  vs.  vemurafenib  was  to  be  tested 
only if these comparisons were statistically significant. The PFS analyses were conducted after more than the 
planned number of events had occurred [204 PFS events (planned 145) for Combo 450 vs. vemurafenib and 
223 PFS events (planned 191) for Combo 450 vs. Enco 300]. 
The  DMC  reviewed  the  results  (and  unblinded  survival  data)  to  which  the  applicant  remained  blinded  and 
recommended  that  the  planned  analyses  be  terminated  and  all  patients  be  informed  of  the  Part  1  results. 
Patients in the vemurafenib arm were to be advised that a BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination might be a better 
alternative.    There  were  no  specific  recommendations  regarding  the  encorafenib  monotherapy  arm.  The  OS 
analysis will likely be confounded by patients in the monotherapy arms seeking alternative treatments. This 
early  termination  is  probably  inevitable  as  Combo  450  was  being  compared  to  single  agent  BRAF  inhibitor 
which  would  not  now  be  considered  standard  of  care  in  this  setting.  Patients  with  V600  mutant  tumours 
would  routinely  be  treated  with  a  BRAF-MEK  inhibitor  combination.  Still,  it  is  accepted  that  at  the  time  the 
trial was designed, the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitor was not the SoC..  
The  study  was  open  label,  given  the  likelihood  of  functional  unblinding  from  the  predicted  treatment 
toxicities.  Efficacy  assessment  by  blinded  independent  review  was  appropriate  to  prevent  evaluation  bias.

Progression  free  survival  as  the  primary  endpoint  is  accepted  as  a  meaningful  reduction  in  the  risk  of 
progression or death represents a clinical benefit in patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. It also 
allowed  for  more  rapid  assessment,  mitigating  the  potentially  confounding  effects  of  post-study  treatments 
on OS. Overall, the design of the study is acceptable and the study was well conducted.  
Supportive  data  is  provided  from  Study  CLGX818X2109  (LOGIC  2),  an  open-label,  single  arm,  Phase  2 
trial. Data has been provided from a subsection of patients (n=75) in Part 1 – Group A – no prior treatment 
with  a  BRAF  inhibitor.    There  was  no  pre-defined  efficacy  endpoint  but  ORR,  PFS,  DOR,  TTR  and  DCR  were 
evaluated and provided supportive evidence of efficacy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  study,  CMEK162B2301,  was  met  as  Combo  450  significantly  improved 
median  PFS  versus  vemurafenib  alone  (14.9  vs.  7.3  months)  based  on  BIRC  review  in  the  full  analysis  set 
(FAS) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.41, 0.71) (one-sided stratified log rank p<0.001) which was statistically 
significant.  PFS  curves  separate  early  (after  approximately  1-2  months)  and  do  not  intersect  until  near  the 
end of follow-up where the number of patients in each arm is ≤ 4. Median follow-up time for PFS per BIRC 
was 16.7 months for the Combo 450 arm and 14.4 months for the vemurafenib arm. About 50% of patients 
were  censored  at  the time  of  the  analysis,  approximately  30%  in  the  Combo 450  arm  due  to  remaining  on 
treatment  and  20%  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  for  starting  a  new  anti-cancer  therapy.  As  the  DMC 
recommended  termination  of  further  analyses  and  all  patients  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  receive  BRAF-MEK 
inhibitor combination therapy there will be no further information on this direct comparison.  
The  sensitivity  PFS  analyses  yielded  similar  HRs  (95%  CI)  and  median  PFS  values  to  the  primary  analysis, 
reflecting the robustness of the PFS benefit. These included the investigator assessment in the FAS, the per 
protocol set (PPS) and tumour assessments after initiation of further anti-cancer therapy. The efficacy results 
based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central assessment. 
Other  than  treatment,  the  only  prognostic  factor  that  significantly  influenced  PFS  was  LDH  increase  of  125 
IU/L.  The  PFS  benefit  was  consistent  across  the  subgroups  analysed,  apart  from  the  presence  of  brain 
metastases. Only 12 patients (9 Combo 450 and 3 vemurafenib) had brain metastases at baseline so there 
were  insufficient  patients  to  evaluate  efficacy  in  this  subgroup.  All  patients  had  BRAF  mutant  V600  E  or  K 
melanoma, which comprise most BRAF mutant patients Across the 3 treatment arms only 24 patients (3.7% 
of  the  Combo  450  arm)  had  received  prior  ipilimumab  in  the  adjuvant  or  metastatic  setting  and  3  patients 
(0.5%  of  the  Combo  arm)  had  received  a  prior  anti  PD1/PDL1  inhibitor  in  the  metastatic  setting.  The  HR 
favoured Combo 450 in the small group of patients that had received prior immunotherapy (n=15; 8 Combo 
450  vs  7  vemurafenib)  although  the  confidence  intervals  were  large.  The  use  of  Combo  450  in  patients 
previously  treated  with  a  BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitor  is  not  supported.  The  median  PFS  in  non-naïve  patients  in 
LOGIC 2 was 3.5 months. 
Results for overall survival have been presented from the OS interim analysis with cut-off date 7th November 
2017, by which time a total of 232 OS events were observed in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms 
combined in Part 1 of the study. The median OS was 33.6 months (24.4, 39.2) and 16.9 months (14.0, 
24.5), respectively, for patients treated with Combo 450 compared to those treated with vemurafenib with a 
HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47, 0.79, nominal p value <0.0001). The median OS was 33.6 months (24.4, 39.2) and 
23.5 months (19.6, 33.6), respectively, for patients treated with Combo 450 compared to those treated with 
encorafenib with a HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06, nominal p value=0.0613). The observed HR and numerical 
increase in median OS supports the relevant contribution of binimetinib and demonstrates a statistically

significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival with the combination treatment of 
binimetinib and encorafenib compared with vemurafenib. 
For  Combo  450  vs  vemurafenib  and  Combo450  vs  encorafenib,  results  of  the  planned  sensitivity  analyses 
were  consistent  with  those  from  the  interim  OS  analysis  and  lead  to  similar  conclusions  about  treatment 
effect.  Most  unstratified  subgroup  analyses  also  demonstrated  median  OS  point  estimates  in  favour  of  the 
Combo 450.  
For  the  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  median  PFS  estimates  by  BIRC  in  the  FAS  were  14.9  and  9.6 
months  for  Combo  450  and  encorafenib,  respectively,  with  a  HR  of  0.75  (95%  CI  0.56,  1.00).  The  PFS 
difference of 5.3 months just missed statistical significance (p = 0.0256) by the one-sided stratified log-rank 
test  with  a  threshold  of  p  <  0.025.  Therefore,  by  the  hierarchical  testing  procedure  none  of  the  further 
endpoints  can  be  considered  statistically  significant  and  nominal  p  values  are  presented  for  descriptive 
purposed only. Per Investigator assessment of response, the PFS difference between the Combo 450 and the 
encorafenib  arm  was  consistent  with  that  reported  by  the  BIRC  (14.8  months  Combo  450  vs.  9.2  months 
Enco  300)  and  this  difference  reached  nominal  significance  at  the  one-sided  0.025  level  (HR  0.68;  95%  CI 
0.52, 0.90; nominal 1-sided p=0.003). The subgroup analyses, including the unstratified HRs, were generally 
consistent with the analysis in the full population, allowing for wide confidence intervals in the subgroups with 
small numbers of patients.  There were some groups with small patient numbers where the HR was greater 
than  1  (e.g.  number  of  organs  involved  at  baseline  1  or  >3)  but  this  is  likely  due  to  chance.  Unstratified 
subgroup  analyses  demonstrated point estimates in  favour  of  Combo  450,  including  LDH  at  baseline,  ECOG 
performance status and AJCC stage. This supports benefit for the combination over single agent encorafenib, 
likely  due  to  the  increased  tolerability  of  encorafenib  with  a  MEK  inhibitor  allowing  a  higher  dose  of 
encorafenib  to  be  administered  (450mg  vs  300mg)  as  well  as  the  anti-tumour  contribution  of  binimetinib 
itself.  
Part 2 of Study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the encorafenib and 
binimetinib combination. Preliminary Part 2 data, at a cut-off date of 9 November 2016, demonstrated the 
contribution of binimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.1, 14.0) for 
Combo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent 
central review (BIRC). The confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9% (95% CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300 and 
50.4% (95% CI: 44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC 
was 12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 and 12.9 months [95% CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. 
The median duration of treatment was longer for Combo 300 vs Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. The 
addition of binimetinib 45mg BID to encorafenib 300mg QD increased the median PFS by 3.7 months 
(stratified HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61, 0.97; nominal 1-sided p=0.015) and the ORR by 15.5%. The investigator 
assessment and sensitivity analyses of PFS were similar. When only the patients randomised to Part 2 were 
assessed the results again supported a binimetinib contribution to efficacy; median PFS values (95% CI) 
were 12.9 months (10.1, 14.0) and 7.4 months (5.6, 9.2), respectively (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.78; 
nominal one-sided p<0.001 per stratified log-rank test). However, it is worth noting that the results for 
encorafenib monotherapy are better in part 1 than part 2 with a difference of over 2 months in median PFS. 
It is possible that differences in baseline characteristics (in particular age, stage of disease and elevated LDH) 
may be responsible for this difference in outcome. Some baseline imbalances can also be seen between 
Combo300 and Enco300 part 2. In particular, a greater proportion of the Enco 300 patients (Part 2) have 
Stage IV disease with elevated LDH compared with the Combo 300 patients.   
Therefore, for patients that must reduce the dose to 300 mg due to ADRs, the data seems to indicate that 
patients will continue to have a similar magnitude of treatment effect.  The proposed dose regimen in the 
Assessment report

applied indication is Combo 450 (binimetinib 45mg BID and encorafenib 450mg QD). Combo 450 (part 1, 
n=192) and Combo 300 (part 2, n=258) were compared post-hoc. Median PFS by BIRC was not statistically 
significantly longer with Combo 450 vs Combo 300 (14.9 months [95% CI 11.0, 18.5] vs 12.9 months [95% 
CI 10.1, 14.0]; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.03]; one-sided log-rank p=0.0845) at the cut-off dates for initial 
analysis (19 May 2016 and 9 November 2016, respectively). Combo 450 did not increase the proportion of 
confirmed responses (63.0% vs. 65.9%), although the median duration of confirmed response was longer 
(16.6 vs. 12.7 months, with overlapping confidence intervals).  When Combo 450 and Combo 300 were 
compared at the same cut-off (9 November 2016) there had been an additional 5 PFS events in the Combo 
450 arm; median PFS by BIRC was 15.5 vs. 12.9 months (stratified HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58, 1.01; 2-sided log 
rank p value 0.0573). However as noted above, patients enrolled to part 2 of the trial seem to have a worse 
prognosis than those in part 1.  
The  confirmed  response  rate  (CR  +  PR)  was  higher  in  the  Combo  450  group  (63.0%)  compared  with 
encorafenib (50.5%) and vemurafenib (40.3%). Confirmed ORR in the small subgroup of patients with prior 
first-line  immunotherapy  was  lower  but  showed  the  same  pattern  as  in  the  overall  population;  Combo  450 
(N=8) 50.0%; encorafenib (N=11) 45.5%; vemurafenib (N=7) 28.6%. These were all partial responses, with 
no complete responses in this subgroup. The median time to response for responders in all treatment arms 
was short (1.9 – 2.1 months), which corresponds with the first post-baseline response assessment at Cycle 3 
Day 1. The median duration of response (DOR) per BIRC, calculated for confirmed responses, was longer in 
the  Combo  450  arm  (16.6  months)  in  the  Combo  450  arm  than  the  encorafenib  (14.9  months)  or 
vemurafenib arms (12.3 months).   
The  PRO  findings  appeared  supportive.  The  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy-Melanoma  (FACT  M), 
the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer’s core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ  C30)  and  the  EuroQoL  5  Dimension  5  Level  examination  (EQ  5D  5L)  were  used  to  explore  patient-
reported outcomes (PRO) measures of health-related Quality of Life, functioning, melanoma symptoms, and 
treatment-related  adverse  reactions.  A  definitive  10%  deterioration  in  FACT  M  and  in  EORTC  QLQ-C30  was 
significantly  delayed  in  patients  treated  with  Combo  450  relative  to  other  treatments.  The  median  time  to 
definitive  10%  deterioration  in  the  FACT-M  score  was  not  reached  in  the  Combo  450  arm  and  was  22.1 
months  (95%  CI:  15.2,  NE)  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  with  a  HR  for  the  difference  of  0.46  (95%  CI:  0.29, 
0.72).  An  analysis  of  time  to  definitive  10%  deterioration  in  EORTC  QLQ  C30  score  provided  with  similar 
results. 
Patients receiving Combo 450 reported no change or a slight improvement in the mean change from baseline 
EQ 5D 5L index score at all visits, whilst patients receiving vemurafenib or encorafenib reported decreases at 
all visits (with statistical significant differences). An evaluation of change over time in score yielded the same 
trend for EORTC QLQ C30 and at all visit for FACT M).  
The  results  from  the  Phase  2  study  CLGX818X2109  provided  preliminary  support  regarding  the  efficacy  of 
Combo 450 in the treatment of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma. The overall response rate (confirmed ORR) of 
69.3% was similar but the median PFS was shorter (14.9 months in Study CMEK162B2301 vs. 9.5 months in 
Study CLGX818X2109). This may be because the PFS data was not fully mature at the time of data cut off; 
median follow up time was 6.4 months compared to 16.7 months for the Combo 450 arm in the COLUMBUS 
trial.  Tumour  assessments  were  performed  every  8  weeks  in  COLUMBUS  compared  to  every  4  weeks  in 
LOGIC 2.  
Encorafenib is to be given in combination with binimetinib. For additional information on warnings and 
precautions associated with binimetinib treatment, see section 4.4 of binimetinib SmPC.

BRAF mutation testing 
Before taking encorafenib in combination with binimetinib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation 
confirmed by a validated test. The efficacy and safety of encorafenib have been established only in patients 
with tumours expressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations. Encorafenib should not be used in patients with 
wild type BRAF malignant melanoma. 
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor 
There are limited data for the use of the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib in patients who have 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with 
BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be lower in these patients.  
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in patients with brain metastases 
There are limited efficacy data with the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with a 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of encorafenib have not yet been established in children and adolescents. No data are 
available. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with encorafenib 
in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, Combo 450 demonstrates both a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in PFS over 
the  comparator  vemurafenib  as  well  as  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  over  encorafenib  monotherapy  at  its 
maximally  tolerated  monotherapy  dose  of  300  mg  QD.  The  OS  results  of  Part  I  of  the  COLUMBUS  study 
demonstrate a statistically significant benefit favouring the Combo 450 treatment over vemurafenib. 
The  combination  therapy  of  binimetinib  and  encorafenib  showed  an  improved  efficacy  compared  to  BRAF 
inhibitors  given  as  monotherapies  (vemurafenib  and  encorafenib)  which  is  consistent  with  clinical  data from 
other  combination  therapies  of  BRAF/MEK  inhibition  of  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  melanoma 
harbouring BRAF V600 mutations. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address issues related to efficacy: 
−  OS results for Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more mature data for the 
Enco300 Part 2 arm. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As of 11 May 2016, a total of 1495 subjects (91 healthy volunteers and 1404 patients with advanced cancer) 
had been exposed to encorafenib. Safety data from 5 clinical trials in patients with unresectable or metastatic 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma were presented in overlapping populations.

These were compared to the vemurafenib 960mg BID arm of the Phase 3 study (N=186). 
In the Combo 450 RP population, the median duration of combination binimetinib and encorafenib exposure 
was 41.9 weeks, with 121 patients (44.2%) exposed to treatment for ≥48 weeks. The median duration of 
exposure was shorter in the Enco 300 P population (29.7 weeks) with 77 patients (35.5%) exposed to 
treatment for ≥48 weeks. 
A similar median relative dose intensity (RDI) was reported for each component (binimetinib 99.6%, 
encorafenib 100%) of the Combo 450 RP population with an RDI of 100% for 44.5% and 50% of patients for 
binimetinib and encorafenib, respectively. The median RDI of encorafenib was lower in the Enco 300 P 
monotherapy population (87.5%) and the proportion with an RDI of 100% was only 28.1%. Exposure in most 
subgroups in the Combo 450 RP population was close to the median. Median exposure was lower in patients 
with baseline liver metastases (N=97), Asian patients and patients with moderate renal impairment but still 
>32 -36 weeks and the last 2 groups involved small patient numbers (n=6 and 4, respectively). Duration of 
treatment in the single patient ≥85 years was only 14 weeks.  
A 4-month safety update was provided in response to the Day 120 list of questions, focussing on pooled data 
from the same studies as presented in the initial MAA. The data cut-off dates and number of patients in each 
study included in the pooled analyses are presented below. The 4-month safety update provides an additional 
750 patient-months of exposure in the Combo 450 RP population and 219 patient-months in the Enco 300 P 
population.

Table 55: 
Clinical Studies Included in Pooled Safety Summaries (Initial MAA and 4-
Month Safety Update) 
The median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in 
patients treated with Enco 300 and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. The median duration of 
exposure to study treatment in the Combo 450 RP population increased by ~9 weeks from 41.9 to 50.6 
weeks, with 142 patients (51.8%) exposed to treatment for ≥48 weeks (increase by nearly 8%). In the Enco 
300 P population, the median duration of exposure to study treatment (29.7 weeks) and the percentage of 
patients exposed to treatment for ≥48 weeks (35.5%) were unchanged. 
The median relative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 100% for encorafenib and 99.6% for 
binimetinib; the median RDI was 86.2% for Enco 300 and 94.5% for vemurafenib. The median relative dose 
intensity decreased slightly (< 5.0%) for the Enco 300 P population, (84.98% vs 87.53% in the initial MAA), 
although the number of patients (n=61, 28.1%) receiving a relative dose intensity of 100% remained 
unchanged.  
In the Combo 450 RP population, the median relative dose intensity of encorafenib and binimetinib was 
99.66% and 99.50%, respectively, similar to that reported in the initial MAA. The relative dose intensity in 
the Combo 450 RP population at the 4-month safety update for encorafenib was 100% in 123 patients 
(44.9%) and 100% for binimetinib in 109 patients (39.8%). 
Adverse events 
For Combo 450 P, the incidence of AEs was 98.9% with Grade 3/4 AEs reported in 57.8% patients (Grade 3, 
48.2%; Grade 4, 9.9%); the median time to onset of the first Grade 3/4 AE was 2.5 months. 
For Enco 300 P, the incidence of AEs was 99.5% with Grade 3/4 AEs observed in 67.3% patients (Grade 3, 
58.1%; Grade 4, 9.2%); the median time to onset of the first Grade 3/4 AE was 0.4 months.

Table 57:  Overall summary of relevant intra-population differences since initial MAA 
in the Enco 300P and COMBO 450 RP (Restricted Safety Set) 
The incidence of patients in the Enco 300P population with at least one dose modification of encorafenib was 
unchanged [155 of 217 (71.4%)].  
In the Combo 450 RP population, the incidence of dose modifications had slightly increased; 147 of 274 
(53.6%) required at least 1 dose modification of encorafenib, 164 of 274 (59.9%) required at least 1 dose 
modification of binimetinib. Modification of encorafenib dose due to an AE occurred in 41.2% of patients, 
including dose reductions (17.5%) and dose interruptions (38.7%). Modification of binimetinib dose due to an 
AE occurred in 45.6% of patients, including dose reductions (30.7%) and dose interruptions (40.5%).  
The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose modification of encorafenib due to an AE (including 
dose reductions and interruptions) remained lower in the Combo 450 RP compared to the Enco 300 P 
population:  
•  53.6% vs 71.4% of patients with dose modifications for any reason 
•  41.2% vs 65.9% of patients with dose modifications due to AEs.

Adjusted for exposure, the rate of AEs was lower in the Combo 450 RP population compared to the Enco 300 
P population (142.83 vs 604.83 per 100 patient-months) and compared to vemurafenib (226.32 per 100 
patient-months).  
When individual AEs were adjusted for duration of exposure, the rate of diarrhoea (4.87 vs 1.46 per 100 pt-
mnths) and increased CK (2.66 vs 0.1 per 100 pt-mnths) was higher with combination treatment; the rates 
of alopecia (1.39 vs. 13.14) , PPE (0.55 vs. 10.45), arthralgia (2.71 vs. 8.4), hyperkeratosis (1.23 vs. 7.13) 
and rash (12.0 vs. 21.7) were higher with single agent encorafenib (Combo 450 RP vs. Enco 300P). 
At the 4 month update no new PTs were reported with an exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) ≥5 per 
100 patient-months in the Combo 450 RP or Enco 300 P populations.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
The  incidence  of  on-treatment  deaths  was  similar  in  the  Combo  450  RP  and  the  Enco  300  P  populations 
(8.4% vs 6.9%, with an EAIR of 0.74 deaths per 100 patient–months in both populations).  
Most deaths were due to progression of malignant melanoma (5.8% Combo 450 vs 5.5% Enco 300 P).  
In the Combo 450 RP population, on-treatment deaths due to events other than disease progression included 
AEs by PT of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage (in the context of brain 
metastasis), completed suicide, euthanasia, myocardial infarction, reported in 1 patient each, and AEs of 
death, reported in 2 patients; 0.7% of deaths were attributed to related AEs.  
Adverse events resulting in death for patients in the Enco 300 P population were reported under the PTs of 
myocardial infarction, unknown cause, general physical health deterioration and pneumonia (1 patient each); 
0.5% of deaths were attributed to related AEs.  
At the four month safety update, the overall incidence of on-treatment deaths (with or without adjustment 
for study drug exposure) was higher in the Combo 450 RP than in Enco 300 P populations (10.2% vs 7.4%), 
with similar EAIRs (as per the initial MAA) of 0.73 vs 0.71 deaths per 100 patient-months respectively. Most 
deaths remained due to progression of malignant melanoma (7.7% Combo 450 vs 6.0% Enco 300 P).

time to first SAE for the Enco 300 P population was shorter than the Combo 450 RP population (1.8 months 
[95% CI: 0.4, 2.9] vs 3.8 months [95% CI: 3.2, 4.9]). 
In the Combo 450 arm of Study CMEK162B2301 Part 1 SAEs were reported most frequently (> 5.0% of 
patients) under the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (9.4%), infections and infestations (8.9%), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (8.3%) and nervous system disorders (7.3%).  
For the Combo 450 RP population, SAEs reported more frequently by PT were pyrexia, pneumonia and 
nausea (2.2% each), for the Enco P population they were nausea and vomiting (2.8% each) and in the 
vemurafenib arm of Study B2301 SAEs were reported most frequently under the PT of general physical health 
deterioration (3.2%). 
SAEs by duration of exposure reflected the unadjusted rate of SAEs, being marginally higher for Combo 450 
RP than Enco 300 P (3.91 vs. 3.50 per 100 patient-months, respectively). The most common PTs were similar 
for EAIR adjusted and non-adjusted rates; for Combo 450 RP the most common exposure adjusted SAEs 
Assessment report

were nausea, pneumonia and pyrexia (0.16 per 100 patient-months each), anaemia and vomiting (0.13 per 
100 patient-months each) and diarrhoea (0.11 per 100 patient-months). This was followed by abdominal 
pain, acute kidney injury, cerebral haemorrhage and general physical health deterioration (all 0.10 per 100 
patient-months).  
For the Enco 300 P population, the most common SAE PTs by EAIR were nausea and vomiting (0.27 per 100 
patient-months each), back pain, CNS metastases and pain (0.18 per 100 patient-months each), facial 
paralysis, hyperglycaemia, myalgia and pyrexia (0.14 per 100 patient-months each) and dehydration and 
musculoskeletal pain (0.13 per 100 patient-months each).  
In the 4-month safety update in the Combo 450 RP, the overall incidence of SAEs regardless of study drug 
relationship increased from 35.8% (grade 3-4, 31.8%) at the time of the initial MAA to 40.1% (grade 3-4, 
34.3%). No SAEs were reported under new SOCs in ≥10% of patients or new PTs in ≥2% of patients in the 
impacted populations as compared to the initial MAA.  
Comparison of the Safety Profile of Combo 300 and Combo 450   
The safety profile comparison is based on the 192 patients randomised to the Combo 450 arm as of the 19 
May 2016 cut-off date (Part 1) and the 258 patients randomised to the Combo 300 arm (one of whom was 
not treated) as of the 09 November 2016 cut-off date (Part 2).  
The median durations of potential follow-up for PFS of 16.7 months for Combo 450 part 1 and 13.9 months 
for Combo 300 part 2 were broadly comparable. The median duration of exposure in the Combo 450 arm and 
Combo 300 arms were similar with 52.6% and 54.9% of patients having received ≥ 48 weeks of study 
treatment, respectively.  
In the Combo300, the median relative dose intensity (RDI) of encorafenib and binimetinib was 100% and 
99.76% respectively, similar to the median RDI of encorafenib and binimetinib in the Combo450.  
The overall safety profiles for the Combo 450 and Combo 300 arms are similar in terms of incidence 
(difference <5%) of deaths, AEs, treatment discontinuation due to AEs and AEs leading to dose 
modifications/ interruptions or additional therapy. The overall incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs, as well as the 
overall incidences of SAEs, was lower in the Combo 300 as compared to Combo 450.

The safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally twice 
daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma (hereafter 
referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most 
common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg administered with 
binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea. 
AEs more frequent in the Combo 450 arm are shown in Table 66 and those more frequent in the Combo 300 
arm are shown in Table 67. The EAIR values were consistent with the imbalances in AE incidences between 
the Combo 450 vs the Combo 300 arm.

The increase in GI events in the Combo 450 arm did not have a big impact on the renal function; PTs of renal 
failure, blood creatinine increased and clinically notable shifts from baseline of creatinine lab parameter were 
similar in both arms. Worsening creatinine from baseline by at least 2 grades or to ≥ Grade 3 occurred for 
17.7 % of patients in the Combo 300 vs 17.1% in the Combo 450. Worst post-baseline Grade 3 increased 
creatinine values occurred in 1.6% in the Combo 300 arm vs 3.6% in the Combo 450. 
The overall incidence of SAEs was lower (difference <5%) in the Combo 300 arm as compared to Combo 450 
arm (29.7% vs 34.4%). The most frequently reported SAEs that were ≥ 2.0% of patients in either treatment 
group occurred under the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (3.1% Combo 300 arm, 9.4% Combo 450), 
infections and infestations (6.2% Combo 300 arm, 8.9% Combo 450), general disorders and administration 
site conditions (3.5% Combo 300 arm, 8.3% Combo 450) and nervous system disorders (Combo 450 arm 
8.2% Combo 300 arm, 7.3%). 
The incidence of on-treatment deaths was similar between the treatment groups (9.7% Combo 300 arm, 
9.9% Combo 450). Most on-treatment deaths were considered due to disease progression. In the Combo 300 
arm and the Combo 450 group, 3 (1.2%) and 2 (1.0%) on-treatment deaths, respectively, were considered 
due to AEs other than disease progression (malignant melanoma/metastases). 
The percentage of patients with AESIs (any grade) considered common to both drugs was higher in the 
Combo 450 arm compared with the Combo 300 arm (66.1% vs 51.4%). The mitigating effect of adding 
binimetinib to encorafenib remined evident for PTs of retinal or pigment epithelium detachment, RVO,

(excluding retinal vein occlusion), rash, LFT abnormalities, haemorrhage and hypertension were more 
common for Combo 450 vs Combo 300.

Grade 
No new or worsened haematology abnormality was reported at a higher or lower incidence (≥5% difference 
for any CTCAE Grade) in the Combo 450 RP population than the Enco 300 P population. Most common in all 
populations was decreased haemoglobin, mainly Grade 1 (Grade 1: 38.1% vs 32.1% of patients, 
respectively; Grade 2: 9.1% vs 10.5%; Grade 3: 1.4% vs 4.5%; Grade 4: none). No patients discontinued 
Combo 450 mg due to anaemia, 1.5% required dose adjustment or study drug interruption and 9.5% 
patients required additional therapy.

Decreased neutrophil count was reported in a higher proportion of patients in the Combo 450 arm of Study 
CMEK162B2301 vs the Enco 300 and vemurafenib arms: 13% vs 4.7% vs 4.8%, respectively with Grade 3/4 
abnormalities reported in 3.1% vs 1% vs 0.5%, respectively. 
Biochemistry 
In the Enco 300 P and Combo 450 RP populations, increased creatinine was the most common new or 
worsened biochemistry abnormality, mainly Grade 1 (Grade 1: 71.3% vs 79.2% of patients, respectively; 
Grade 2: 9% vs 15.2%; Grade 3: 0.5% vs 3%; Grade 4: none). More patients in the Combo 450 RP 
population had a worsening of post-baseline creatinine by ≥2 grades (17.3% vs 9.5%).  
In the Combo 450 RP population, hepatic laboratory values of >3 x ULN increases in ALT occurred in 9.7% of 
patients and >3 x ULN increases in ALT or AST occurred in 4.3% of patients. The median time to first onset 
was 29.0 days [range 1-534 days]. In the Enco 300 P population, no common newly occurring notable 
hepatic laboratory values were reported in ≥5% of patients for any class.

There were too few patients in the Enco 300 P population with notable hepatic laboratory values and even 
fewer patients with baseline liver metastases to detect a difference in notable hepatic laboratory values. An 
assessment of the larger number of patients in the Combo 450 RP population revealed no increase in notable 
hepatic laboratory values in the patients with liver metastases as compared with patients without liver 
metastases. 
Table 71: 
Summary of Patients with Newly Occurring Notable Hepatic Laboratory 
Values 
No cases meeting the case-finding criteria of Hy’s law were identified in the Combo 450 RP or Enco 300 P 
populations. As per the 4-month safety update, no new cases of hepatic events fulfilling the Hy’s Law criteria 
was identified in any patient within the same investigated population. 
In the Combo 450 RP population 2 patients had Grade 4 CK elevation, which resolved in 0.3 and 1.0 months 
respectively. A total of 47/259 (18.1%) patients with baseline Grade 0/1 CK level had a ≥2-grade increase. 
In the subgroup of patients using statins this proportion was 3/24 (12.5%) with no increases to Grade 3/4 
levels. In the Enco 300 P population and the vemurafenib arm of the trial no patients were reported with 
Grade 4 CK elevation. None of the 15 patients who experienced left ventricular dysfunction AESI events had 
concomitant CK elevations, thus no blood samplings for CK isoenzymes and troponin I were undertaken as 
per study protocol. However, the presented results regarding elevations / shifts of CK values (including

isoenzymes) argue in favour of skeletal muscle cell damage-induced elevations of CK with no evidence of 
cardiac damage in the Combo 450 arm. 
Increased blood glucose was recorded across the treatment arms with an incidence of Grade 3/4 of 5.5%, 
4.8% and 3.6% for Combo 450 RP, Enco 300 P and vemurafenib respectively. 
The incidence of newly occurring or worsening proteinuria was similar in the Enco 300 P and Combo 450 RP 
populations for both Grade 1 and 2 values (Grade 1: 5.4% vs 8%, Grade 2: 3.7% vs 2.9%). 
Blood pressure (BP)  
Newly abnormal BP values were reported with a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in Combo 450 RP than the 
Enco 300 P population for both systolic (15.5% vs 8.6%) and diastolic BP (11% vs 2.9%). This corresponds 
with a higher incidence of hypertension AESIs in the Combo 450 RP vs Enco 300 P population (12% vs. 
5.5%). 
Electrocardiogram (QTc Effects) 
In Study CMEK162B2301, QTcF increases by >60 ms were observed in 5.4%, 3.9% and 5.6% of patients in 
the Combo 450, Enco 300 and vemurafenib arms, respectively, QTcF increases by >30ms were observed in 
26.9%, 29.1% and 42.5% of patients, respectively and new QTcF values >500 ms were observed in 0.5%, 
2.8% and 1.7% of patients, respectively. 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
Mean worst absolute change in LVEF from baseline was similar in the Enco 300 P and Combo 450 RP 
populations (4.6% vs 5.9%), as was mean worst LVEF value (61.1% [SD 5.9%] vs. 58.1% [5.6%], 
respectively). However, more patients in the Combo 450 RP than in the Enco 300 P population experienced a 
CTCAE Grade 0 to Grade 2 LVEF shift (24.7% vs. 8.5%). Similar magnitude of change was seen in patients 
with or without baseline cardiac, LVD and hypertension risk factors.    
Mean worst absolute change in LVEF from baseline was similar in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib arms 
(6.2% vs 4.3%). A higher percentage of patients in the Combo 450 arm than in the vemurafenib arm 
experienced a CTCAE Grade 0 to Grade 2 LVEF shift (28.4% vs 8.2%).   
Ophthalmologic Evaluation 
Changes in visual acuity (assessed by Snellen logMAR score) and intraocular pressure from baseline to end of 
treatment were similar between the Enco 300 P and Combo 450 RP populations. However, there was less of a 
shift towards reduced visual acuity in the Enco 300 P compared with the Combo 450 RP population (patients 
with a logMAR ≤0 with a shift to ≥0.3, 4.4% vs 10.1%, respectively). 
There was less of a shift towards reduced visual acuity in the Enco 300 arm compared with the vemurafenib 
arm (patients with a logMAR ≤0 with a shift to ≥0.3, 4.6% vs 8.1%, respectively). 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In the Combo 450 RP population, 194 patients were <65 years and 80 patients were ≥65 years; 259 
patients were <75 years and 15 patients were ≥75 years. 
Assessment report

AEs (all grades) reported in more patients ≥65 years than patients <65 years included diarrhoea (43.8% vs 
33%), increased GGT (21.3% vs 10.8%), pruritus (16.3% vs 6.2%) and increased blood ALP (15% vs 4.1%).   
AEs (all grades) that were reported in at least 3 patients and in >25% more patients ≥ 75 years than 
patients < 75 years included nausea (66.7% vs. 37.8%), diarrhoea (60% vs. 34.7%) and asthenia (53.3% 
vs. 11.6%). 
In the Enco 300 P population, 172 patients were <65 years and 45 patients were ≥ 65 years, 205 patients 
were < 75 years and 12 patients were ≥ 75 years. 
AEs (all grades) reported in more patients ≥65 years than patients <65 years included asthenia (28.9% vs 
16.9%), constipation (24.4% vs 14%) and increased GGT (22.2% vs 7.6%). 
AEs (all grades) reported in at least 3 patients and in ≥ 25% more patients ≥ 75 years than patients < 75 
years in the Enco 300 P population included, respectively: GGT increased (41.7% vs. 8.8%) and anaemia 
(33.3% vs. 5.4%). 
A higher proportion of patients ≥65 years had Grade 3/4 AEs compared with those patients aged <65 years 
across all the study populations and all treatment arms in Study CMEK162B2301.

Regarding race, results should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of patients in 
the Asian and Other (often <10) compared with the Caucasian subgroup. 
No clinically relevant differences in the proportion of AEs were noted by gender or presence/ absence of 
baseline brain metastases, although the numbers with baseline brain metastases were low (8 in the Enco 300 
P and 15 in the Combo 450 RP populations).  
Hepatic Impairment 
Assessment report

Study ARRAY-818-101 investigated the PK of encorafenib in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, as 
defined by Child-Pugh Score. Preliminary results indicate an approximate 25% increase in overall encorafenib 
exposure (AUCinf) compared to matching healthy subjects. Most AEs were mild or moderate, except for 1 
Grade 3 AE of increased pancreatic enzymes deemed related and 1 Grade 3 AE of food allergy deemed not 
related.  
Immunological events 
Drug hypersensitivity is a known BRAFi class effect. Drug hypersensitivity (PTs of drug hypersensitivity, 
hypersensitivity, urticaria and angioedema) occurred in 2.9% of patients with no discontinuations, dose 
adjustments or study drug interruptions. 
Drug hypersensitivity was recorded in 4.1% of the Enco 300 P population, with 0.5% Grade 3 events; 0.9% 
of patients discontinued and 1.8% patients required dose adjustment or study drug interruption. 
In CMEK162B2301, the incidence of drug hypersensitivity was similar in the Combo 450 and vemurafenib 
arm (3.6% vs 4.8%) but the median time to first was longer in the Combo 450 arm (88.0 vs.  21.0 days). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Study ARRAY-818-105 investigated the effects of posaconazole and diltiazem (strong and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors, respectively) on the single-dose PK of encorafenib in healthy subjects. The higher encorafenib 
exposure resulted in more treatment emergent AEs. Concomitant administration of encorafenib with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided due to increased encorafenib exposure and potential increase in toxicity.  
For additional information, please refer to the Clinical Pharmacology section. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
About 10% of patients discontinued due to an AE in the Combo 450 RP population and 17.5% in the Enco 
300 P population (Grade 3/4 AEs: 8.8% vs 13.4%).  No AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were 
reported in ≥2% of patients in the Combo 450 RP population whilst PPE (3.7%) was the only AE in the Enco 
300 P population. 
In the Phase 3 study, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in the Combo 450 arm included increased 
ALT and AST (2.6% each) whilst no specific AEs led to discontinuation in ≥2% of patients in either the Enco 
300 or vemurafenib arms.

At the 4-month safety update, no AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported under new PTs in 
≥2% of patients in any populations as compared to the initial MAA (except few switches to ~2% due to a 
single additional case in the population concerned).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety information on encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in the proposed indication is based 
primarily on data from 274 patients in 3 clinical trials treated at the recommended dose of encorafenib 450 
mg QD and binimetinib 45 mg BID [Combo 450 RP] in BRAF/ MEK inhibitor naïve patients. This is a small 
data set but considered sufficient to characterise the safety of the combination given that other BRAF/ MEK 
inhibitor combinations are already authorised. This data is supplemented by information from an additional 
216 patients (total number 433 = Combo BP) treated with a combination of binimetinib 45 mg BID and 
encorafenib at doses from 300 mg to 600mg QD (Combo 400, n=4; Combo 600, n=62; Combo 450, n=367).  
In the Combo 450 subgroup, 274 patients were BRAF/MEK-treatment naïve (corresponding to the Combo 450 
RP population) and 97 were non-naïve.  
Safety data from 217 BRAF inhibitor naïve patients who received single agent encorafenib (Enco 300 P) 
population were provided for comparison. Data from the pivotal Study CMEK162B2301 were presented 
separately, for comparison of Combo 450, encorafenib and vemurafenib monotherapy (N=186).  
The 4-month safety update provides an additional 750 patient-months of exposure in the Combo 450 RP 
population and 219 patient-months in the Enco 300 P population.  
Safety data were also provided from the 258 patients randomised to the Combo 300 arm (one of whom was 
not treated) as of the 09 November 2016 cut-off date (Part 2). This was compared to the Combo 450 trial 
population.  
The safety population is consistent with the target patient population with respect to gender and race, 
although the mean age of the trial patients was slightly lower than might be anticipated clinically; the results 
can be extrapolated to the intended population.  
The median duration of exposure to study treatment was longer in the Combo 450 RP population than in the 
Enco 300 P population (50.6 weeks vs 29.7 weeks). The median relative dose intensity (RDI) was also higher 
for the combination (encorafenib 99.66%; binimetinib 99.5%) than single agent encorafenib (84.98%).  
Despite the higher median relative dose intensity and longer median duration of exposure to study treatment 
in Combo 450 RP vs Enco 300 P, better general tolerability of Combo 450 (with encorafenib 450 mg QD) was 
observed compared to encorafenib single agent 300 mg QD or vemurafenib. A slightly lower percentage of 
patients in the Combo 450 RP, compared with the Enco 300 P population, experienced at least one Grade 3/4 
AE (61.3% vs. 67.7%) or an AE leading to treatment discontinuation (11.7% vs. 18.0%). A bigger reduction 
was evident in AEs requiring dose interruption/change (52.2% vs. 71%). Similar percentages of patients 
experienced AEs requiring additional therapy (89.8% Combo 450 RP, 94.9% Enco 300 P).  
The median time to onset of first Grade 3/4 AEs was longer in the Combo 450 RP population than in the Enco 
300 P population: 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 3.2) vs 0.4 months (95%CI: 0.3,0.9) [initial MAA]. 
Similarly, the proportion of patients experiencing these events was lower in the Combo 450 RP population 
than in the vemurafenib arm of Study CMEK162B2301. 
However, the overall incidence of on-treatment deaths was higher in the Combo 450 RP than in Enco 300 P 
populations (10.2% vs 7.4%), with similar EAIRs of 0.73 vs 0.71 deaths per 100 patient-months respectively. 
Most on treatment deaths were due to malignant melanoma. Other causes of death in the Combo 450 RP 
population included multiple organ dysfunction, suicide, cerebral haemorrhage, euthanasia and myocardial 
infarction. In the Enco 300 P population, causes of death included pneumonia and acute MI. Mostly there was 
a single event involving a PT and no pattern was evident.

The proportion of patients with SAEs was higher in the Combo 450 RP population than in Enco 300 P (40.1% 
vs 32.7%) but similar after adjustment for treatment exposure (EAIRs of 3.9 and 3.5 per 100 patient-
months); the EAIR was higher in the vemurafenib arm (4.96 per 100 patient-months). The only SAE which 
was increased by ≥2% in the Combo 450 RP vs Enco 300 P population was pyrexia (3.5% vs. 1.4%).  
The overall safety profile of single agent encorafenib (Enco 300 P) was consistent with the mechanism of 
action and the known toxicities of BRAF inhibitors. The AE profile of the two BRAF inhibitors was similar but 
differences were evident. The overall EAIR was notably higher in the Enco 300 P population than in the 
vemurafenib arm (604.83 vs 226.32 per 100 patient-months). Vemurafenib caused relatively more 
photosensitivity, diarrhoea, pyrexia and squamous cell carcinoma whilst encorafenib (Enco 300 P) caused 
more constipation, neuropathy, facial paresis, myalgia and melanocytic naevus.  
The most common ADRs (≥ 25 %) for Enco 300 P were hyperkeratosis (58.5%), alopecia (57.1%), palmar 
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (51.6%), rash (43.3%), arthralgia (43.3%), nausea (37.8%), dry skin 
(37.8%), myalgia (35.9%), headache (29%), fatigue (43.8%), vomiting (27.6%), pruritus (29.5%). The 
most common Grade 3/4 ADRs (≥ 5%) were PPE syndrome (12.4%), arthralgia (9.2%), myalgia (9.2%) and 
hyperkeratosis (6%). When adjusted for exposure, AEs with an EAIR of ≥5 per 100 patient-months in the 
Enco 300 P population included alopecia (13.14), PPE syndrome (10.45), arthralgia (8.4), hyperkeratosis 
(7.13) and nausea (5.87). 
In the Combo 450 RP population, most of the observed toxicities were BRAF or MEK inhibitor driven and 
involved gastrointestinal, ocular, liver, muscular and cutaneous events. The most commonly reported adverse 
events (≥20%) in the Combo 450 RP population included fatigue (41.6%) and gastrointestinal disorders: 
nausea (41.6%), diarrhoea (38%), vomiting (28.1%), constipation (24.1%), arthralgia and increased blood 
CK (both 27.0%). Most of the events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were 
increased transaminases (5.5%), increased gamma GT (8.4%), hypertension (5.5%) and CK elevation 
(5.8%).  
With combination treatment, the incidence of non-malignant skin AEs, arthralgia, myalgia, decreased appetite 
and insomnia was decreased compared to single agent encorafenib. The decreases in overall incidences of 
these AESIs with Combo 450 were generally associated with relevant decreases in Grade 3/4 events, dose 
adjustments/study drug interruptions and use of additional therapies. Conversely, the incidence of diarrhoea, 
abdominal pain, retinopathy, hypertension, increased blood CK and increased transaminases was greater with 
Combo 450 vs. Enco 300.  
Adjusted for exposure, the only AE in the Combo 450 RP arm with an EAIR of ≥5 per 100 patient-months 
was nausea (5.21). Adjusted for exposure, the rates of alopecia, PPE, arthralgia, hyperkeratosis and rash 
were higher with single agent encorafenib than combination treatment. Although no AEs with an EAIR of ≥5 
per 100 patient-months were reported at a higher incidence in the Combo 450 RP population than in the Enco 
300 P population (difference of ≥5) the rate of diarrhoea (4.87 vs. 1.46) and increased CK (2.66 vs. 0.1) was 
higher with combination treatment (Combo 450 RP vs Enco 300 P respectively). The increase in blood CK 
observed with Combo 450 was rarely associated with clinical symptoms.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  haemorrhagic  events  was  higher  in  the  combination  but  the  incidence  was 
similar  when  adjusted  for  treatment  duration  (1.55  vs  1.52  cases  per  100  patient  months).  No  serious 
haemorrhage  with  established  causal  relationship  to  the  combination  was  reported,  although  there  were  3 
cases  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  (1  fatal)  in  the  setting  of  brain  metastases.  On  review  none  of  the 
hemorrhagic  events  correlated  with  changes 
in  coagulation  parameters  (i.e. 
increased  INR)  or 
thrombocytopenia.

Haemorrhages, including major haemorrhagic events, can occur with encorafenib (see section 4.8). The risk 
of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. The 
occurrence of Grade ≥3 haemorrhagic events should be managed with dose interruption or treatment 
discontinuation (see Table 3 in section 4.2) and as clinically indicated. 
New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with BRAF 
inhibitors and can occur when encorafenib is administered (see section 4.8). No case of new primary 
melanoma was reported in the Combo 450 RP population compared to 4.1% in the Enco 300 P population, 
and fewer patients experienced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in the Combo 450 RP compared to Enco 
300 P single agent group (2.6% vs. 6.9%). Cutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma (cuSCC) including kerathoacanthoma has been observed in patients treated with BRAF-inhibitors 
including encorafenib. 
New primary melanoma has been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors including encorafenib (see 
section 4.8). For new primary cutaneous malignancies: No dose modifications are required for encorafenib. 
For new primary non-cutaneous RAS mutation-positive malignancies: it should be considered to discontinue 
encorafenib and binimetinib permanently. 
Dermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with encorafenib in combination 
with binimetinib, every 2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the 
combination. Suspicious skin lesions should be managed with dermatological excision and dermatopathologic 
evaluation. Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their physicians if new skin lesions develop. 
Encorafenib and binimetinib should be continued without any dose modification.  
Based on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS 
through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving encorafenib should undergo a head and neck 
examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography (CT) scan, anal and pelvic examinations (for women) 
and complete blood cell counts prior to initiation, during and at the end of treatment as clinically appropriate. 
It should be considered to permanently discontinue encorafenib in patients who develop RAS mutation-
positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should be carefully considered before administering 
encorafenib to patients with a prior or concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation. 
The most common binimetinib-driven ADRs included skin reactions, ocular reactions (retinal detachment, 
visual impairment), left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension and CK elevation. These can be managed via 
monitoring of left ventricular function, blood pressure and ophthalmological assessments with dose 
modifications as needed.  
LVD defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction has been reported when 
encorafenib is used in combination with binimetinib. 
It is recommended that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is assessed by echocardiogram or multi-gated 
acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of encorafenib and binimetinib, one month after initiation, and then 
at approximately 3-month intervals or more frequently as clinically indicated, while on treatment. If during 
treatment LVD occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC.  
The safety of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with a baseline 
LVEF that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limits of normal. Therefore, in these patients, 
binimetinib should be used with caution and for any symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, Grade 3-4 LVEF 
or for absolute decrease of LVEF from baseline of ≥ 10%, binimetinib and encorafenib should be discontinued 
and LVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks until recovery.

Ocular toxicities including uveitis, iritis and iridocyclitis can occur when encorafenib is administered. RPED has 
also been reported in patients treated with encorafenib in combination with binimetinib (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbance. If symptoms 
of new or worsening visual disturbances including diminished central vision, blurred vision or loss of vision 
are identified, a prompt ophthalmologic examination is recommended.  
If, uveitis including iridocyclitis and iritis occurs during treatment, see section 4.2.  
If during treatment patient develops RPED or RVO, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for guidance. 
The incidence of liver function test abnormalities, including Grade 3/4 events, was higher with combination 
treatment compared to single agent encorafenib. However, none met the criteria for Hy’s Law. There was one 
case of hepatic failure associated with disease progression that was not considered related to the combination 
treatment but attributed to new hepatic metastases. The incidence of GGT abnormalities was higher with 
combination treatment (14.6% overall; Grade 3/4 8.4%). This parameter is less specific for hepatic toxicity 
than ALT, ALP, bilirubin and other hepatic parameters and may not reflect hepatic toxicity. It may be due to 
the inducer effect of encorafenib on liver metabolism via CYP3A4. 
Liver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT elevations have been observed with encorafenib (see 
section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of encorafenib and binimetinib and 
monitored at least monthly during the 6 first months of treatment, then as clinically indicated. Liver 
laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation 
(see section 4.2). 
Renal dysfunction including creatinine elevation and renal failure (renal failure, acute kidney injury and renal 
impairment) was a common adverse effect for encorafenib as single agent and in combination with 
binimetinib in Combo 450. Renal dysfunction was frequently associated with gastrointestinal 
events/dehydration. Clinical data shows reversibility when it is managed through dose modification, standard 
care and corrective therapy. 
Relatively few patients discontinued treatment due to an AE (11.7% vs. 18.0% - Combo 450 vs Enco 300).  
In patients treated with Combo 450 (n = 274), 194 patients (70.8%) were <65 years old, 65 patients 
(23.7%) were 65 -74 years old and 15 patients (5.5%) were aged > 75. No overall differences in safety or 
efficacy were observed between elderly patients (≥ 65) and younger patients. The proportions of patients 
experiencing adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were similar in patients aged <65 years 
and those aged ≥65 years. The most common AEs reported with a higher incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 
years compared to patients aged < 65 years included diarrhoea, pruritus, GGT and blood phosphatase 
alkaline elevation. In the small group of patients aged ≥75 years (n=15), patients were more likely to 
experience serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
The incidence of pyrexia was distinctly lower in the Combo 450 RP population and secondary causes were 
generally evident. Pyrexia was the most commonly reported SAE by PT in the Combo 450 arm of Study 
CMEK162B2301 in 6 (3.1%) patients. None of the 6 patients had concurrent events of hypotension, 
chills/rigors, dehydration, renal failure or syncope and most had concurrent factors including disease 
progression or underlying infection which may have contributed to the pyrexia. Compared to other MEK/BRAF 
inhibitors, Grade 3/4 anaemia was reported more often with binimetinib/encorafenib. The incidence of 
abdominal pain was higher compared to other MEK/BRAF inhibitor combinations.

Encorafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have been 
reported in some patients treated with encorafenib during clinical studies. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse reactions that may affect 
their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Overdose Symptoms 
At doses of encorafenib between 600 to 800 mg once daily, renal dysfunction (Grade 3 hypercreatinaemia) 
was observed in 3 out of 14 patients. The highest administered dose occurred as a dosing error in one patient 
who took encorafenib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 1 day (total dose 1200 mg). Adverse reactions 
reported by this patient were Grade 1 events of nausea, vomiting and blurred vision; all subsequently 
resolved. 
Management 
There is no specific treatment for overdose.  
Since encorafenib is moderately bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the 
treatment of overdose with encorafenib. There is no known antidote for encorafenib. In the event of an 
overdose, encorafenib treatment should be interrupted and renal function must be monitored as well as 
adverse reactions. Symptomatic treatment and supportive care should be provided as needed. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
Dose modifications in case of adverse reactions are provided below and in Table 2 and 3 of the SmPC. 
If treatment-related toxicities occur, then encorafenib and binimetinib should be simultaneously dose 
reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where dose modifications are necessary for binimetinib only 
(adverse reactions primarily related to binimetinib) are: retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED), retinal 
vein occlusion (RVO), interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, cardiac dysfunction, creatine phosphokinase (CK) 
elevation and rhabdomyolysis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
If one of these toxicities occurs, see section 4.2 of binimetinib SmPC for dose modification instructions for 
binimetinib. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Combo 450 vs Combo 300 
The median duration of exposure in the Combo 450 and Combo 300 arms were similar with, respectively, 
52.6% and 54.9% of patients having received ≥ 48 weeks of study treatment. 
The overall tolerability profiles of these two combinations were broadly similar (for AEs requiring 
discontinuation, dose modifications or additional therapy) but Combo 450 led to an increased incidence of 
SAEs and Grade 3-4 AEs. Combo 450 generated an increased incidence of the most common side effects 
compared to Combo 300, particularly nausea (41.1 vs. 27.2%), vomiting (29.7 vs. 15.2) and headache (21.9 
vs. 11.7%).  
The median time to onset of key tolerability parameters was longer in the Combo 300 arm compared with the 
Combo 450 arm for:

Page 156/171 
  
  
- First SAE (3.5 vs 4.7 months respectively)  
- First AE resulting in study drug discontinuation (3.8 vs 4.7 months respectively) 
The percentage of patients with one or more encorafenib AESI (any grade) was similar in the two populations 
(14.6% vs 14.4%). Surprisingly, the percentage of patients with one or more binimetinib specific AESIs (any 
grade) was higher too in the Combo 450 arm compared with the Combo 300 arm (69.3% vs 56.8% 
respectively). However, the incidence of binimetinib specific AESIS leading to drug discontinuation or drug 
modification were similar between Combo 450 and Combo 300. This may be due to a rather arbitrary 
allocation of AESI between encorafenib and binimetinib in the original assessment, which has since been 
changed/ rectified. Retinopathy (excluding retinal vein occlusion), rash, liver function tests (LFT) 
abnormalities, haemorrhage and hypertension were more common for Combo 450 vs Combo 300. 
This is comparison of Combo 450 vs. Combo 300 is a post-hoc analysis and patients were recruited at 
different times (30 Dec 2013 to 10 Apr 2015 for Combo 450 and 19 March 2015 to 12 Nov 2015 for Combo 
300). It is possible that investigators had more experience in treating/ preventing AEs by the time of 
recruitment to Combo 300; given that different centres participated in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study it is 
more likely that the difference is simply due to the encorafenib dose. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Encorafenib  was  associated  with  more  AEs  than  vemurafenib.  The  overall  incidence  was  reduced  by  the 
combination with binimetinib, mainly due to the reduction in skin-related AEs. Diarrhoea, increased blood CK 
and liver function test abnormalities were more prevalent with the Combo 450 than single agent encorafenib 
300mg.  There  was  no  difference  in  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  SAEs  between  Combo  450  and 
encorafenib  monotherapy.  Most  AEs  appeared  to  be  manageable  with  dose  reduction/  interruption  and 
additional therapy. Combo 450 led to an increased incidence of SAEs and Grade 3/4 AEs compared to Combo 
300. The AE profile for Combo 300 should be conveyed in the SmPC, section 4.8 (OC).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 27 June 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of encorafenib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers encorafenib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Braftovi (encorafenib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for an indication of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
BRAF- MEK inhibitor combination regimens are currently the main standard of care for treatment of advanced 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma that have tumours harbouring the BRAF V600 mutation.  Tumour 
Assessment report

responses have reported as high as up to 70% and rapid response induction has been associated with 
symptom control. Median PFS has been shown to be increased to approximately 12 months and this has 
translated into an improvement in median OS to 22-25 months.  
Other treatment options include anti PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which showed a 
clinically and statistically significant PFS benefit over the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab. Emerging data 
suggest that BRAF inhibition is effective following immunotherapy, and checkpoint inhibitors are still effective 
in patients who have progressed on kinase-inhibitor therapy.  
Although there are treatments for metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600 mutation that have shown clinical 
benefit, patients usually relapse or discontinue due to AE or tolerability issues. Therefore, there is still a need 
for treatment choices with improved efficacy or different safety profiles over existing medicinal products. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Phase 3 clinical study (COLUMBUS) was a randomised, open label trial in patients with advanced 
unresectable or metastatic BRAF (either V600 E or K) mutation-positive melanoma comprised of 2 parts: 
−  Part 1 randomised 577 patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to encorafenib 450mg QD and binimetinib 45mg BID 
(Combo 450, N=192), encorafenib 300mg QD (N=194) or vemurafenib 960mg BID (N=191). 
Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage, ECOG performance status and prior first line 
immunotherapy. 
−  Part 2 was planned to randomise 320 patients in a 3: 1 ratio to Combo 300 (encorafenib 300mg QD 
and binimetinib 45mg BID) or encorafenib 300mg QD. This part of the trial was to estimate the 
treatment effect of Combo 300 vs. LGX818 in terms of overall survival (OS), estimate the treatment 
effect of Combo 300 vs. vemurafenib in terms of PFS and OS and estimate the treatment effect of 
Combo 300 vs. Combo 450 in terms of PFS and OS. 
The DMC advised study termination on 14 October 2016 based on unblinded efficacy data, including OS 
results to which the Sponsor remained blinded. The Part 1 efficacy data were presented in the initial dossier 
and the Part 2 results were provided during the procedure.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The trial met its primary endpoint, with an improved median PFS by 7.6 months in the Combo 450 arm 
compared to single agent vemurafenib with a median PFS of 14.9 months vs. 7.3 months, respectively, HR = 
0.54 (95% CI 0.41, 0.71, 1 -sided stratified log-rank p<0.001) is the FAS. 
The results in the per protocol set (PPS) by BIRC were supportive of the primary analysis. Median PFS was 
15.5 months (95% CI, 11.0, 18.7) in the Combo 450 arm and 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.6, 8.3) in the 
vemurafenib arm, HR=0.53 (95% CI, 0.40, 0.70; nominal p < 0.001). 
The HR was consistent by investigator review and in the sensitivity analyses, including an analysis counting 
new therapy as an event (HR=0.53).  
The median PFS of single agent vemurafenib (7.3 months) was consistent with what has been seen in 
previous studies and, it was noted that the median PFS of the Combo 450 (14.9 months) was longer than 
that reported for  other BRAF- MEK inhibitor combination treatments (median PFS for trametinib and 
dabrafenib = 11.4 months; cobimetinib and vemurafenib = 12.3 months). 
Assessment report

Encorafenib monotherapy increased median PFS by 2.3 months compared to vemurafenib (9.6 months vs. 
7.3 months; nominal one-sided log-rank p = 0.004; HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52, 0.90) by BIRC. This was a 
secondary efficacy endpoint, downgraded from a co-primary endpoint with Protocol Amendment 3 (post 
randomisation of 364 patients). Investigator assessment of response gave similar median PFS durations. 
Median PFS values by BIRC were the same in the PPS as in the FAS.  
The confirmed overall response rate (ORR) per BIRC was higher with combination treatment: 63.0% (95% CI 
55.8, 69.9) in the Combo 450 arm compared with 50.5% (95% CI 43.3, 57.8) in the encorafenib arm and 
40.3% (95% CI 33.3, 47.6) in the vemurafenib arm. 
The disease control rate (DCR) per BIRC was 92.2% (95% CI 87.4, 95.6) in the Combo 450 arm compared 
with 84.0% (95% CI 78.1, 88.9) in the encorafenib arm and 81.7% (95% CI 75.4, 86.9) in the vemurafenib 
arm. 
Median time to objective response (TTR) per BIRC, calculated for responding patients only (confirmation not 
required), was 1.9 months in the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 1.9, 1.9), 2.0 months in the encorafenib arm 
(95% CI 1.9, 3.6) and 2.1 months in the vemurafenib arm (95% CI 1.9, 3.7). 
The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M global health status score was not reached in 
the Combo 450 arm (95% CI 22.1, NE) and was 22.1 months (95% CI 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm 
with a HR for the difference of 0.46 (95% CI 0.29, 0.72) using a stratified Cox regression model. The median 
time to definitive 10% deterioration in the FACT-M was 20.3 months (95% CI 15.0, NE) in the encorafenib 
arm with a HR for the difference between Combo 450 and encorafenib of 0.48 (95% CI 0.31, 0.75) using a 
stratified Cox regression model. 
The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status score was 
delayed by 7.3 months in the Combo 450 arm compared to the vemurafenib arm: 23.9 months (95% CI 
20.4, NE) vs. 16.6 months (95% CI 11.9, NE) with a HR for the difference of 0.55 (95% CI 0.37, 0.80) using 
a stratified Cox regression model. The median time to definitive 10% deterioration in the QLQ-C30 global 
health status scores was 9.2 months longer in the Combo 450 arm compared with the Enco 300 arm (14.7 
months [95% CI 9.2, 18.4]), with a HR for the difference of 0.45 (95% CI 0.31, 0.65) using a stratified Cox 
regression model.   
The median OS was 33.6 months (95% CI [24.4, 39.2]) and 16.9 months ((95% CI [14.0, 24.5]) for Combo 
450 compared to vemurafenib (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47, 0.79, nominal p value <0.0001). Estimates of OS at 
12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (95% CI [68.8, 81.0]) and 57.6% ((95% CI [50.3, 64.3]) for Combo 
450 compared to 63.1% ((95% CI [55.7, 69.6]) and 43.2% ((95% CI [35.9, 50.2]) for vemurafenib.  
The  median  (95%  CI)  OS  was  33.6  months  (24.4,  39.2)  and  23.5  months  (19.6,  33.6)  with  Combo  450 
compared  to  encorafenib,  respectively,  with  a  HR  0.81  (95%  CI  0.61,  1.0;  nominal  p  value  =0.0613,  2-
sided). Estimates of OS at 12 months and 24 months were 75.5% (68.8, 81.0) and 57.6% (50.3, 64.3) for 
Combo 450 compared to 74.6% (67.6, 80.3) and 49.1% (41.5, 56.2) for encorafenib. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There were some uncertainties concerning the best dose for encorafenib (450mg vs 300 mg) that should be 
used in combination with binimetinib. Single agent binimetinib has limited activity in BRAF-mutated 
melanoma patients. In the phase II study CMEK162X2201, the 4.9% response rate in 41 patients, based on 
locally assessed unconfirmed responses, is low for a monotherapy MEK inhibitor compared to results of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 163/171 
  
  
trametinib reported in a pivotal phase III study. Binimetinib 45mg BID contributed to the efficacy of Combo 
300 and allowed a higher dose of encorafenib to be administered in Combo 450. 
It was unclear whether Combo 450 offered an additional PFS benefit over Combo 300. In the analysis with 
comparable median duration of potential follow-up for PFS (16.7 months and 13.9 months), Combo 450 
showed a median 2-month improvement in PFS compared with Combo 300 (14.9 vs 12.9 months). This 
difference was not statistically significant (HR of 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.03]) one-sided log-rank p=0.0845). 
The second analysis performed using the 09 November 2016 cut-off date for the two arms was statistically 
significant (HR 0.73 95%CI [0.55 0.97]; 2-sided p=0.0278). However, this result is due to a very uneven 
duration of follow-up for PFS per BIRC (Kaplan Meier) with 22.5 months for Part 1 Combo 450 arm compared 
with 13.9 months for Part 2 Combo 300 arm. Combo 450 did not improve the response rate compared with 
Combo 300 (63.0% vs 65.9%) but did lead to a numerically longer duration of confirmed responses (16.6 
months vs 12.7 months).  
Normally statistical significance would not be demanded between the two parts of the study and the 2.8-
month improvement in median PFS with Combo 450 compared with Combo 300 could be considered clinically 
relevant. However, in this instance, the fact that encorafenib 300mg performed significantly better in Part 1 
than in Part 2 with a 2.2-month difference in median PFS hinders the PFS comparison of the combination 
treatment (Combo 450 vs Combo 300) between the two parts of the study. Therefore, the OS results for 
Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more mature data for the Enco300 Part 2 arm 
will be provide as a post-authorisation measure. 
The Exposure-Response analyses suggest that increasing encorafenib AUCss in Combo 450 has a negative 
influence on ORR and PFS. Baseline LDH >ULN was more common in patients with a higher AUCss; high LDH 
is known to be a negative prognostic marker predicting a shorter PFS. In Part 1, in the high LDH group only 
patients with high encorafenib exposure in Combo 450 did worse. There was no such finding with Combo 300 
in Part 2. There remains the possibility that this association in the Combo 450 arm is a chance finding or 
artefact. It remains possible that the B/R ratio could be improved in patients with high baseline LDH by 
identification of other factors that potentially influence encorafenib exposure. Therefore, the applicant is 
requested to submit the overall survival results stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2) 
as a post-authorisation measure.  
In order to characterise the patient population that responds to treatment, the applicant is requested to 
submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) for 
evaluation as soon as available, to support the synergistic pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib in 
combination with binimetinib. The results will be provided as a recommendation.  
In addition, genomic analysis of baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing would be 
informative to assess whether there is a relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes. As 
indicated in the protocol, genomic alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, 
MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential association between 
baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes. The results will be provided as a recommendation.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For Combo 450 P, the incidence of AEs was 98.9% with Grade 3/4 AEs reported in 58.0% patients (Grade 4, 
9.9%); the median time to onset of the first Grade 3/4 AE was 2.5 months. AEs led to dose interruption/ 
change in 47.1% patients, additional therapy in 86.1% and treatment discontinuation in 10.4%.

The safety of encorafenib (450 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally twice 
daily) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma (hereafter 
referred to as the pooled Combo 450 population), based on two Phase II studies (CMEK162X2110 and 
CLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1). At the recommended dose (n = 274) in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, the most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring 
in patients treated with encorafenib administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
retinal detachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, blood CK increased and myalgia.  
When encorafenib was used at a dose of 300 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg twice daily 
(Combo 300) in study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, the frequency category was lower compared to the pooled 
Combo 450 population for the following adverse reactions: anemia, peripheral neuropathy, haemorrhage, 
hypertension, pruritus (common); and colitis, increased amylase and increased lipase (uncommon). 
Encorafenib exposure and risk of toxicity is increased in patients with mild hepatic impairment and use of 
concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
The addition of binimetinib (Combo 450 RP) attenuated some of the adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs) compared to single agent encorafenib (Enco 300 P). These were mainly non-malignant skin AESIs, 
myopathy -related AESIs (myalgia), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and new melanoma. Facial paresis 
(facial paralysis) was an AE associated with encorafenib monotherapy that was also reduced with combination 
treatment (7.4% vs. 0.7%), as was tachycardia (6% vs. 1.8%). 
Other AESI were worsened or enhanced by the addition of binimetinib (Combo 450 RP compared to Enco 300 
P). These included retinopathies (52.6% vs 12.4%); increased blood CK (24.8% vs 1.4%) with 5.5% Grade 
3/4 events; left ventricular dysfunction (8.4% vs 1.8%); hypertension (12% vs 5.5%) with Grade 3/4 (6.2% 
vs 2.8%) and abnormal liver function tests (25.2% vs 13.8%). No cases consistent with Hy’s Law were 
reported. There was one event of liver failure in the context of liver metastases, deemed unrelated to 
treatment.  
The incidence of haemorrhage-related events was similar in the Combo 450 RP and Enco 300 P populations 
(15.7%-1.55 cases per 100 patient-months vs 12.9%-1.52 cases per 100 patient-months) Haemorrhage is a 
class effect for MEK inhibitors and is an important identified risk for binimetinib. Haemorrhagic events in the 
Combo 450 RP population (16.8%, 46/274) were mainly Grade 1/2 (14.2%) with few dose reductions or 
interruptions and treatment discontinuations in 3 (1.1%). The most frequent haemorrhagic events were GI. 
Intracranial haemorrhage was reported in 1.6% (3/192) of patients in the setting of new or progressive brain 
metastases including one fatal event. 
The incidence of on-treatment deaths (within 30 days of the last dose) was similar for Combo 450 RP (8.4%), 
Enco300 P (6.9%) and vemurafenib (10.2%) and most of the deaths were due to malignant melanoma. 
The overall tolerability profiles of Combo 450 and Combo 300 were broadly similar in terms of AEs requiring 
discontinuation, dose modifications or additional therapy but Combo 450 led to increased incidence of SAEs 
and Grade 3-4 AEs. Combo 450 generated an increased incidence of the most common side effects compared 
to Combo 300, particularly nausea (41.1 vs. 27.2%), vomiting (29.7 vs. 15.2) and headache (21.9 vs. 
11.7%). The time to first SAE and AE resulting in study drug discontinuation was shorter for Combo 450.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no studies or data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and studies have 
shown that there is a risk for over-exposure in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
Therefore, a warning in section 4.4 has been included that in the absence of clinical data, encorafenib is not 
recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
Although a QT study has not been conducted, encorafenib was shown to have the potential to cause QT 
prolongation at clinically relevant doses. In Study CMEK162B2301, QTcF increases by >60 ms were observed 
in 5.4%, 3.9% and 5.6% of patients in the Combo 450, Enco 300 and vemurafenib arms, respectively and 
new QTcF values >500 ms were observed in 0.5%, 2.8% and 1.7% of patients, respectively. QTc 
prolongation is a class-effect of BRAF inhibitors. Therefore, a warning in the SmPC section 4.4 has been 
included. 
Based on the mechanism of action, non-cutaneous malignancies could potentially arise as a result of 
treatment with encorafenib and binimetinib and therefore, a warning has been included in the SmPC section 
4.4. 
Encorafenib is mainly metabolised via CYP3A4 and there is a possibility of over-exposure due to concomitant 
use with strong and moderate CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. A warning has been included in 4.4, with a description 
of concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors to avoid in section 4.5. Furthermore, a drug-
drug cocktail interaction study will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure in order to better 
characterise the metabolic pathways and transporters involved in encorafenib elimination. 
In non-clinical models, there is some evidence that there may be embryo-foetal toxicity associated with 
encorafenib administration. Therefore a warning has been included in section 4.6.  
There are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment and PK population analysis has provided 
an indication that there is the potential for renal dysfunction due to overdose. Therefore, a warning has been 
included in section 4.4 that encorafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment 
and that blood creatinine should be monitored as clinically indicated and managed with dose modification or 
discontinuation.  In addition, there is a potential of over-exposure in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment. The CHMP considers that the applicant should collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma 
patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination 
with binimetinib to determine the plasma concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed to 
guide dosing recommendations in these patient populations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PFS improvement for Combo 450 compared to vemurafenib is considered clinically meaningful. In 
addition, the significant prolongation in OS with a difference in median survival of 16.7 months in favour of 
Combo 450 is clinically important. 
The median PFS result for Combo 450 (14.9 months) compares very favourably with other BRAF-MEK 
inhibitor combinations already authorised (trametinib and dabrafenib, median PFS is 11.4 months or 
cobimetinib and vemurafenib with a median PFS of 12.3 months).  The median potential durations of follow-
up for OS were 37.2 months (Combo 450) and 35.9 months (vemurafenib) in Study CMEK162B2301 (using 
Kaplan Meier Approach), 22.3 months (vemurafenib/cobimetinib) and 17.4 months (vemurafenib) in coBRIM, 
and 26.1 months (dabrafenib/trametinib) and 17.8 months (vemurafenib) in COMBI-v. The median OS of 
33.6 months with Combo 450 is impressive in comparison with the other regimens (median OS 22.3 to 26.1 
months).  
The ORR and the disease control rate were high for Combo 450 and the onset of response was rapid, within 
around 2 months, in responders. This corresponds to the first clinical visit and it is possible that responses 
occurred earlier, allowing relief of symptoms, particularly for patients with bulky disease.  
Combo 450 had better general tolerability than encorafenib monotherapy, as evidenced by the QoL analysis 
and the lower overall rate of AEs. Treatment continued at high relative dose intensity in the combination arm. 
Still, the proportion of SAEs was not reduced compared to encorafenib monotherapy, and the combination did 
introduce additional toxicities, specifically increased CK, hypertension, abnormal LFTs, LV dysfunction and eye 
disorders. These events may not have influenced tolerability, but decreased ejection fraction and increased 
ALT did result in dose adjustment or study drug interruption. These AEs have the potential to be serious but 
are manageable if the routine regular screening of patients whilst on treatment is adhered to and 
recommendations from the SmPC are followed.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations are known to be effective in BRAF V600 mutant malignant melanoma. 
Combo 450 led to an improved PFS compared to monotherapy vemurafenib and a median OS at the upper 
end of the range of survivals currently reported for metastatic malignant melanoma. While vemurafenib 
monotherapy is no longer the main standard of care for metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 168/171 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
as a result, the comparison with a treatment arm which is currently regarded as suboptimal is not 
encouraged, it nevertheless remains evident that there is a clinically relevant benefit that has been 
demonstrated with the combination treatment of encorafenib with binimetinb in patients with metastatic 
melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutation.  The safety of the combination is considered acceptable and 
ADRs can be managed through routine risk minimisation activities with no further additional risk minimisation 
activities required. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Approximately  37-50%  of  patients  with  metastatic  melanoma  have  mutations  in  BRAF,  and  over  95%  of 
these  are  in  BRAF  exon  15  at  the  V600 position.  The  most  common  V600  mutations  are  V600E  and  V600K 
accounting  for  80-90%  and  7-30%  of  all  BRAF  V600  mutations,  respectively.  Other  more  rare  activating 
mutations  include  V600R  and  V600D.  These  mutations  constitutively  activate  BRAF  protein  and  signal 
downstream  to  activate  the  RAF/MEK/ERK  pathway,  which  signals  for  cancer  cell  proliferation  and  survival. 
The patient population recruited in the pivotal clinical trial were tested for the presence of BRAF V600 E or K 
mutation, which was an inclusion criteria that a patient’s tumour had to be confirmed by a validated test prior 
to  treatment  initiation.  Based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  and  the  non-clinical  data  showing  the  inhibitory 
activity of encorafenib against BRAF V600E/K/R, the indication has been expanded to include all BRAF V600 
mutations  as  it  is  expected  that  encorafenib  may  target  and  inhibit  BRAF  regardless  of  the  type  of  V600 
substitution.  
The patient population included in the pivotal study were patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of 
locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma or unknown primary melanoma (AJCC 
Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) and excluded patients with uveal and mucosal melanoma. The indication includes all 
types of melanoma as the prevalence of uveal melanoma and mucosal melanoma is low and few patients 
would have been recruited in the trial. In addition, there is no standard of care for these types of melanoma 
and it is expected that all melanoma patients with a BRAF V600 mutation would benefit from having 
treatment options that are targeted and have demonstrated efficacy. Patients also had not received prior 
treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform 
treating physicians that it appears that patients who have received prior BRAF treatment seem to have lower 
efficacy when treated with the combination. It is also noteworthy that the trial population included naive 
untreated patients or patients who have progressed on or after prior first-line immunotherapy for 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Nevertheless, the indication does not specify the line 
of treatment as it is left to the treating physician and clinical practice to determine the best treatment 
algorithm for an individual patient. Section 5.1 of the SmPC describes the patient population that was 
included in trial. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Braftovi is positive. 
The CHMP requests the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
−  OS results for Combo 300 and updated Combo 300 PFS analysis, including more mature data for the 
Enco300 Part 2 arm. 
−  DDI cocktail study: OATP and BCRP will be explored in the ongoing DDI study with rosuvastatin 
(study ARRAY-818-103)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/554696/2018 
Page 169/171 
  
  
−  Overall survival results stratified by LDH level for Combo 300 and Enco 300 (Part 2).  
−  To collect PK samples from BRAF melanoma patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
after repeated dosing of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib to determine the plasma 
concentrations in relation to administered dose and AEs observed to guide dosing recommendations 
in these patient populations. 
The CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the following measures to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
−  The applicant should commit to submit the results of the planned biomarker analyses for Study 
B2301 (from all 3 treatment arms) for evaluation as soon as available, to support the synergistic 
pharmacodynamic activity of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib. Genomic analysis of 
baseline samples remaining after centralized BRAF testing. As indicated in the protocol, genomic 
alterations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN, cKIT, PIK3CA, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, ARAF, c-MET, CRAF, 
EGFR and CCND1 may be explored to find a potential association between baseline mutations and 
efficacy outcomes. 
−  The relationship between baseline mutations and efficacy outcomes should be performed, and a date 
provided to submit the results. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Braftovi is favourable in the following indication: 
Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

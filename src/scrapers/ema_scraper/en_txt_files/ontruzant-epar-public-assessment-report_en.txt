2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary breast 
cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have shown that 
there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC and 7.1% to 42.6% for 
FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a shortened 
disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress HER2. HER2 
overexpression was found in a number of disease states, including metastatic breast cancers, early breast 
cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD) can be shed 
into the blood stream and measured in serum samples (see Herceptin SmPC section 5.1). 
Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta membrane region of HER2’s 
extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and 
prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a 
result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of 
human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to 
be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not 
overexpress HER2 (see Herceptin SmPC section 5.1). 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was first authorised in the EU on 28 August 2000 (see Herceptin EPAR). It is 
currently approved for the treatment of HER2 positive early and metastatic breast cancer and HER2 
positive metastatic gastric cancer.  
Herceptin is available as 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous 
administration and 600 mg solution for injection for subcutaneous administration. 
About the product 
Ontruzant (trastuzumab) is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by mammalian Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture and purified by several chromatography steps including 
specific viral inactivation and removal procedures. 
The Applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications and posology for the proposed biosimilar 
Ontruzant as granted for Herceptin in the European Union (EU): 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC): 
- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease. 
- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). 
- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see SmPC 
section 5.1). 
- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay 
(see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal 
junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have 
HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ 
result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Ontruzant is available as 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion. 
HER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). Ontruzant 
treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (see SmPC section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. 
Ontruzant intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be 
administered via an intravenous infusion only. 
In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicinal 
product being prepared and administered is Ontruzant (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for marketing authorisation of Ontruzant (also referred 
to as “SB3”), as a biosimilar product to the European reference product Herceptin (trastuzumab). This 
application concerns only IV administration. Ontruzant will be available as 150 mg powder for concentrate 
for solution for infusion.

Ontruzant and the reference product. All studies were conducted against the EU-approved Herceptin as 
reference product. In some (non)clinical studies, the applicant also compared Ontruzant to the 
US-approved Herceptin. Ontruzant has been developed in accordance with applicable EU guidelines, in 
particular: 
• 
“Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substance – quality issues, Revision 1” (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012); 
•

For the development of Ontruzant, the Applicant sought Scientific Advice (SA) from the EMA Scientific 
Advice Working Party (SAWP) to discuss the physicochemical, pharmaceutical and biological, and clinical 
development of Ontruzant (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/466180/2015). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ontruzant (also referred to as SB3) finished product (FP) is presented as a sterile, lyophilised powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion containing 150 mg trastuzumab as active substance (AS). Other 
ingredients are L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate; L-histidine; α,α-trehalose dihydrate and 
polysorbate 20. The product is supplied in a clear glass type I (Ph. Eur.) vial with butyl rubber stopper as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. Ontruzant is produced by mammalian CHO cell suspension culture.  
All materials used in the manufacture of Ontruzant active substance (AS) and finished product (FP) are of 
non-animal origin.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Ontruzant (trastuzumab) is a recombinant DNA-derived, humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa) 
that contains human framework regions with the complementarity-determining regions of a murine 
antibody (4D5) that binds to HER2. Ontruzant consists of 1,328 amino acids and has a molecular weight 
of approximately 148 kDa. Trastuzumab is comprised of two identical HCs and two identical LCs. One 
N-linked glycosylation site is located at Asparagine-300 on each heavy chain. There are no O-linked 
glycosylation sites. 
The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is known to be its selective binding to the extracellular domain 
of HER2 receptor. This prevents dimerisation of HER2 receptor, which increases endocytotic destruction of 
Assessment report

the receptor, inhibits shedding of its extracellular domain, and activates immune response. This results in 
a decrease in cell signalling through the RAS-MAPK pathway, which leads to inhibition of tumour cell 
proliferation. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ontruzant active substance (AS) is manufactured at the Biogen large-scale manufacturing facility in 
Hillerød, Denmark.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
After thawing of the WCB vial, the culture is serially expanded in cell mass and volume for inoculation into 
the production bioreactor. The cell culture fluid is subsequently purified through a series of 
chromatographic steps, virus inactivation and filtration steps. 
Control of materials 
Details of the various solutions and media used in the manufacturing process are described. All materials 
used in the manufacture of Ontruzant AS are of non-animal origin. Both compendial and non-compendial 
raw materials are used during production of Ontruzant AS, although non-compendial raw materials were 
not used in the purification process. The water for injection (WFI) meets Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Information and testing for raw materials has been provided. 
The host cell line used in Ontruzant manufacturing is the CHO cell line.  
Gene and vector construction, development of the production cell line are suitably detailed. Materials of 
animal origin were used only during early cell line development and a TSE risk assessment has been 
provided. 
Cell bank testing was performed according to ICH Q5A(R1), ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For the control of the Ontruzant AS manufacturing process, critical (CCP), key (KCP) and non-key (N-KCP) 
control parameters have been defined for each step in the process. The criticality is associated with the 
impact on the defined critical quality attribute (CQA) of the Ontruzant AS. Performance parameters are 
designated in-process controls (IPC), critical in-process controls (CIPCs), or in-process tests (IPT) and 
critical in-process tests (CIPTs). These have been defined in the dossier and are based on development 
experience and risk assessments, which are detailed in the submission. Critical Quality Attributes were 
described in detail. Appropriate actions, taken if limits are exceeded, have been specified. 
Process validation 
Ontruzant active substance manufacturing process validation included process consistency studies, 
shipping qualification, impurity clearance studies, viral clearance studies, intermediate hold studies and 
column lifetime studies. Scale-down models used in the validation studies were suitably qualified. 
Validation of the purification confirms that each step shows consistent product yield and reduces the 
impurity content to an acceptable level. Impurities include cell-derived impurities (DNA and HCP), 
process-related impurities and product-related impurities. Suitable process controls have been applied at 
all stages of the manufacturing process.  
The maximum hold times of process intermediates was evaluated.  
Following the completion of process validation studies, process controlled parameters were re-evaluated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 14/118 
 
 
 
 
Shipping qualification data have been provided for the active substance. 
Overall, results from the process validation studies show that the manufacturing process consistently 
produces AS of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process 
acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process was initially developed at pilot scale. The process was scaled up as well as 
moved to a new facility. For the process validation (and commercial) batches some further (minor) 
modifications and optimisations were introduced. Comparability studies were performed for pilot scale 
lots, clinical lots and process validation run (PVR)/commercial lots. Based on the results to date, it is 
concluded that the clinical and PVR batches of Ontruzant as well as pilot and clinical batches, are 
comparable. 
Characterisation 
The characterisation of Ontruzant included a comprehensive battery of physicochemical and biological 
tests using sensitive and orthogonal state-of-the-art qualified analytical methods in order to elucidate the 
primary, secondary and higher-order structure, post-translational modifications, glycosylation, charge 
variants, purity/impurities, quantity and biological properties. 
As for the process-related impurities (including HCP and host cell DNA), clearance validation studies have 
been performed to demonstrate that the Ontruzant manufacturing process provides adequate clearance 
of such impurities. 
Biological potency was determined by anti-proliferation assays and antibody dependent cell-mediated 
Cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Anti-proliferation assays with Ontruzant were performed using a HER2 
overexpressing human breast cancer cell line. The ADCC assay was performed using a human breast 
cancer cell line overexpressing HER2 as target cells, and NK-CD16 cell line, a human natural killer cell line 
expressing CD16 as effector cells.   
Specification 
The proposed specification for Ontruzant has been provided with information on the analytical methods 
used for control of Ontruzant active substance. This includes general tests, biological activity, identity 
tests, quantitation, tests for purity and impurity, and safety tests.  Stated impurities have been present 
in material used in clinical trials. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures have been described. Validation reports from the QC testing site were given. 
Compendial methods were verified. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data show that the results are consistent and all within the acceptance criteria in place at 
the time of testing.  
Reference materials 
The reference standards used in the release and stability testing of Ontruzant active substance are the 
same as those used for the release and stability testing of Ontruzant finished product. The applicant has 
provided detailed information on Reference Standards used to date. Each lot of Reference Standard was 
extensively qualified according to release tests as well as additional characterisation tests. The applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 15/118 
 
 
 
 
 
also provided the testing program that will be used for qualification of future Working Reference 
Standards. This test panel is deemed sufficient. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf-life of the active substance is based on the long-term stability results. 
Real time, real condition stability data have been presented for active substance (stored in containers 
representative of the proposed container for AS storage). Studies were conducted in accordance with ICH 
guidelines and analytical methods were stability-indicating. Since the pilot and clinical batch are 
comparable to and representative of the commercial AS batches, these data can be used to support the 
shelf-life of the AS. Supportive accelerated stability data are also presented. In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the AS is sufficiently stable and justifies the proposed shelf life in the 
proposed container. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ontruzant finished product (FP) is a sterile, white to pale yellow, lyophilised powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. Lyophilised Ontruzant FP is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection 
(WFI) to yield a single dose formulation of approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab at pH 6.0, and is further 
diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The finished product is intended to be stored at 2°C to 8°C. 
One single-use vial contains 150 mg trastuzumab as the active substance and the excipients 
α,α-trehalose dihydrate, polysorbate 20, L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, which are all 
of Ph.Eur. compendial grade. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The composition of Ontruzant finished product is presented in Table 2 below.

Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation composition proposed is identical to that of Herceptin. Formulation studies were 
performed to ensure the robustness of Ontruzant formulation, as well as the effects of pH, protein 
concentration and excipients on the stability of Ontruzant FP. Accelerated, stress and ongoing stability 
studies confirm the compatibility of Ontruzant AS with the excipients.  
The changes of the manufacturing process between clinical and PVR batches were suitably described, and 
the potential impact of these changes was evaluated. PVR batches were manufactured based on the 
findings from process characterisation studies and engineering runs. After the completion of process 
validation, performance parameters were reviewed and modified, taking the knowledge gained from the 
PVR campaign, manufacturing experience, additional process characterisation results, risk assessments, 
and overall process capabilities into account. 
Acceptable comparability between clinical lots and PVR lots was demonstrated and the modifications 
introduced subsequently are minor and acceptably justified. 
The primary packaging material for Ontruzant FP (150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
in a vial) consists of a depyrogenated and sterilised 15 mL Type I borosilicate glass vial, stoppered with a 
sterilised bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium crimping cap. The finished product 
vials are packaged in a carton to protect from light. Compatibility of the container closure system with 
Ontruzant FP comprised a toxicological assessment of detected extractables and leachables studies. 
Integrity of the container closure system was confirmed. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP manufacturing process involves thawing of active substance, pooling/mixing of the active 
substance, followed by sterile filtration and vial filling/stoppering, lyophilisation and crimping. The vials 
are subjected to visual inspection before packaging. 
The controlled parameters, in-process tests and controls have been given for all relevant manufacturing 
steps, with associated in-process specifications and/or action limits where applicable. The definitions and 
terminology for the classification of the controlled parameters were also given.  
The process controls and hold times have been validated through engineering and process validation 
runs. PVR studies included manufacturing process validation, media fill validation, sterile filter validation, 
cleaning validation and shipping validation. Based on the results obtained from the validation study, it 
was confirmed that the commercial manufacturing process for Ontruzant FP was validated.  
Product specification 
The proposed commercial Ontruzant finished product release and shelf-life specifications have been 
provided. Many test methods of the commercial Ontruzant finished product release and shelf-life 
specifications are identical to those of the active substance; specifications for quantity, identity, biological 
activity, purity and impurities, and safety are included. Other general tests are also included in the 
specification for the finished product. 
Analytical methods 
Most of the analytical procedures specific for finished product are compendial methods which have been 
verified to be suitable for intended use; the non-compendial method has been validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 17/118 
 
 
 
 
 
Batch analysis 
Batch data has been provided, which showed consistent results for all the batches manufactured at 
commercial scale. 
Reference materials 
See AS section. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the Ontruzant FP is 36 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C in the commercial 
container closure system.  
Stability data, in accordance with ICH guidelines, have been provided for Ontruzant finished product 
under long-term (5 ± 3°C), accelerated and stressed conditions in the container closure system intended 
for the commercial product, to support the proposed shelf life. Analytical methods are stability indicating.  
Ontruzant FP was stable even within immediate packaging under extreme light. An infusion study showed 
that Ontruzant FP reconstituted solution for injection is stable for 48 hours at 5°C and is suitable for 
administration into patients intravenously through infusion bags/systems of PVC or PP or PE or Glass 
materials at 30°C for a period of 24 hours. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed 
out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The proposed shelf life for FP of 36 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C in the commercial container closure 
system is acceptable. After reconstitution with sterile water for injection the reconstituted solution is 
physically and chemically stable for 48 hours at 2°C - 8°C. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
The comparability assessments were performed to ensure that the batches used at each stage of 
Ontruzant development are representative of subsequent development stages. 
Biosimilar comparability exercise for Ontruzant and Herceptin 
A comprehensive similarity study has been performed to assess the biosimilar comparability of Ontruzant 
with Herceptin, including characterisation of structural, physicochemical and biological properties of 
Ontruzant clinical material and PVR batches, in side-by-side assays with EU Herceptin (Reference 
Product).  
Ontruzant active substance and finished product batches used in the biosimilar comparability exercise 
were all manufactured at commercial scale at the proposed manufacturing sites. Several EU Herceptin 
lots were used for the biosimilar comparability assessment. The Applicant employed statistical analysis 
involving tolerance intervals. Since the use of tolerance interval based ranges may result in broad 
similarity ranges, the results have been re-evaluated based on the actual range of data (minimum and 
maximum values) obtained from these EU batches, in additional to the data from side-by-side assays. 
Supportive data was also provided from US Herceptin and Korean Herceptin, although these were not 
considered in the main evaluation. Results from primary structural analysis showed that the molecular 
weights, N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, peptide maps, disulphide bonds, levels of free thiol group 
and the N-linked glycosylation site were similar for Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. Slightly lower levels of 
N-terminal pyroglutamate were detected in Ontruzant batches. During C-terminal sequencing, Ontruzant 
was found to have a higher C-terminal lysine content and higher C-terminal α-amidated Pro content 
2 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

compared to the EU Herceptin. Heterogeneity of C-terminal residues is characteristic of therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies and since C-terminal lysine is cleaved by the carboxypeptidase enzyme when it 
enters the blood, it is not expected to impact the PK profile. Levels of proline α-amidation are low and the 
small difference is not expected to influence the effector function and antigen binding affinity of these 
antibodies.  
Structure-activity relationship studies performed in Ontruzant and EU Herceptin showed that there was 
no difference in the biological activities between the basic isoforms. Minor differences were found in 
methionine oxidation and deamidation profiles of Ontruzant compared to EU Herceptin. However, 
Ontruzant and EU Herceptin showed similar FcRn binding activities, which indicates that the difference in 
Met oxidation was not significant and antigen binding was not affected. 
The analysis of the N-glycan profiles included a detailed quantitative and qualitative measurement of all 
major glycoforms. Ontruzant has a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn300, occupied predominantly 
by fucosylated biantennary structures containing 0, 1, or 2 terminal galactose residues and afucosylated 
biantennary structures with no terminal galactose. Low levels of high mannose (HM) structures were also 
identified, with total levels of afucosylated species (%afucose + %HM) evaluated. Data from Ontruzant 
and EU Herceptin appeared highly similar. 
The results showed that the purity of Ontruzant and EU Herceptin was similar. On the other hand, the 
results showed that the %Main peak of Ontruzant was slightly lower than that of EU Herceptin. However, 
the results showed that Ontruzant PVR batches were within the similarity range, whereas Ontruzant 
clinical FP batches had a slightly higher HMW impurity level compared to EU Herceptin. Overall, the level 
of HMW was low in all batches of Ontruzant. Orthogonal analyses results followed a similar trend with 
comparable levels of HMW species. There was no difference between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin.  
Charge variants analysis of Ontruzant and EU Herceptin was performed. Results showed that the relative 
content of acidic and basic variants for Ontruzant was higher than those of EU Herceptin, with a 
consequent lower %main peak for Ontruzant compared to Herceptin. However, further studies performed 
using isolated charge variants  showed that all variants had comparable biological activities for Ontruzant 
and EU Herceptin.  
The secondary structure was elucidated by far-UV CD and FTIR; the tertiary structure by near-UV CD, 
hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/DX) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); the size distribution 
by SE-HPLC/MALLS and SV-AUC; the sub-visible particles by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and 
micro-flow imaging (MFI). Qualitative analyses of the results suggest that the Ontruzant PVR batches are 
similar to Herceptin in the higher-order structures. The protein contents were determined in terms of 
concentration (A280), although the results showed that the protein content of Ontruzant was at the lower 
end of the range determined for EU Herceptin.  
In order to assess biological activity of Ontruzant, various cell-based and binding assays were performed. 
Results from cell-based assays, including the anti-proliferation assay showed that Ontruzant activity was 
similar to EU Herceptin in terms of biological properties (cellular potency). Results from the ADCC assay 
for Ontruzant and EU Herceptin were also comparable. Results from binding assays including HER2 
binding, Fc receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn) binding and C1q binding 
assay showed similar immunochemical properties between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. Results from 
additional biological assays demonstrated similarity between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin in terms of 
potential MoA of trastuzumab.  
In addition to comprehensive and state-of-the-art characterisation study, the comparative stability study 
was performed for Ontruzant FP and Herceptin in several stress conditions. The results demonstrated that 
the stability profile of Ontruzant FP was similar to that of Herceptin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 19/118 
 
 
 
 
In summary, according to the overall characterisation results performed for Ontruzant and EU Herceptin, 
it is concluded that Ontruzant is similar to EU Herceptin in terms of physicochemical and biological 
attributes.  
Analytical Result Summary of Additional Batches of Herceptin and Ontruzant Clinical FP  
After similarity assessment between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin was completed, additional Herceptin 
lots were analysed by the applicant for monitoring purposes. During this analysis, it was noted that for 
many of the more recent batches of EU Herceptin (starting from the lots with expiry dates of Oct 2018) 
and US Herceptin (lots with expiry dates from Aug 2018), apparent shifts were found in terms of ADCC 
activity.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

Quality trends over time in %Afucose+%HM and ADCC activity were analysed (Figure 3) and individual 
lots of EU Herceptin (blue dots) and US Herceptin (green dots) from historical data were plotted by expiry 
date (EU lots that were used in the Phase III clinical study are indicated as red dots). Since ADCC is one 
of main MoA of trastuzumab, the quality shift may be considered as a factor that may impact on the 
clinical efficacy. Further detailed discussion is provided in the clinical section. 
Adventitious agents 
The manufacturing process of Ontruzant active substance and finished product does not contain any 
material of human or animal origin and therefore the risk from adventitious agents is low. The risk of 
microbial and mycoplasma contamination is adequately addressed. Animal-derived raw materials were 
used to establish the Ontruzant cell line and certificates of suitability and/or certificates of origin have 
been provided for these raw materials. Mycoplasma and sterility testing was performed on the cell banks 
in accordance with ICH Q5D. Low bioburden is specified for active substance bulk and the finished product 
must be sterile. 
Due to the expression system with CHO cells, virus validation studies are performed as required in the 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/398498/2005, ICH Q5A(R1) and ICH Q5D guidelines. The choice of model viruses is 
considered appropriate. The MCB, WCB and EEPCB were analysed and confirmed to be free of 
adventitious viruses.  
The virus clearance capacity of the Ontruzant AS purification process has been validated in accordance 
with ICH Q5A (R1). All purification process steps, which comprise dedicated viral removal steps and virus 
inactivation have been validated.  The potential number of retrovirus-like particles present in the 
maximum dose has been calculated, and the safety margin to viral clearance capacity is acceptable. 
In conclusion, the viral and TSE safety of this product have been suitably addressed. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and finished product manufacturing process and process controls for Ontruzant are, 
in general, described in sufficient detail. Raw materials have been sufficiently described and controlled on 
the whole. A two-tier cell bank system was established, with testing and qualification of the MCB and WCB 
according to ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D. Critical process parameters were identified for the manufacturing 
process and the process was appropriately validated for AS and FP. Viral clearance studies have confirmed 
sufficient viral inactivation/removal over several steps in the purification process. 
Analytical methods were suitable and adequately validated. The proposed specifications and acceptance 
limits are deemed acceptable to control the quality of the active substance and finished product. However, 
although specifications for two FP tests are acceptable for authorisation, CHMP has recommended that the 
limits be reviewed in the light of manufacturing experience. Tests for HCP, microbial contamination, 
adventitious viruses (in vitro testing), mycoplasma and MMV are performed as critical in-process controls 
on the unprocessed bulk harvest, which is acceptable. Container closure systems of AS and FP were 
qualified. The claimed 36 month shelf life for Ontruzant FP stored at 5 ± 3°C is supported by stability data. 
A comprehensive similarity study has been performed to assess the biosimilar comparability of Ontruzant 
with EU Herceptin, including characterisation of structural, physicochemical and biological properties in 
side-by-side assays. Results from primary structural analysis showed that these were comparable, apart 
from slightly lower levels of N-terminal pyroglutamate, slightly higher C-terminal lysine and C-terminal 
α-amidated Pro content in Ontruzant batches. However, these differences were small and unlikely to have 
any impact on safety and/or efficacy. Minor differences in methionine oxidation and deamidation profiles 
of Ontruzant compared to EU Herceptin did not appear to affect biological activities (HER2 binding, ADCC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 21/118 
 
 
 
 
and anti-proliferation assay). The major N-glycan structures were similar, although minor differences in 
the relative content of N-glycans (G0F, G1F and G2F) were found between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin, 
including a slightly higher content of %Afucose +%HM in Ontruzant. Charge variant analysis revealed 
slightly higher levels of acidic and basic variants in Ontruzant. Importantly, the biological function 
parameters (HER2 binding, anti-proliferation, ADCC, C1q binding and Fc receptor binding) of Ontruzant 
were all similar to those of EU Herceptin, particularly when data from several EU Herceptin batches was 
considered in addition to the side-by-side assays. Results from additional biological assays demonstrated 
similarity between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin in terms of potential MoA of trastuzumab. The stability 
profiles of Ontruzant and EU Herceptin were also comparable. Therefore, it can be concluded that from a 
quality point of view, Ontruzant can be considered as biosimilar to EU Herceptin. It is noted that the more 
recent batches of EU Herceptin showed shifted %Afucose + %HM and ADCC levels; this is discussed 
further in the clinical section. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant is requested to take into account two quality recommendations. 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP has recommended two points for investigation as stated in the report. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical programme consisted in a series of in vitro PD studies conducted to assess the biological 
activity of Ontruzant (also referred as SB3) compared to EU or US Herceptin using various cell-based and 
binding  assays.  An  in  vivo  study  assessing  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of  Ontruzant  compared  to  EU 
Herceptin and US Herceptin in the orthotopic BT-474 human breast cancer cell xenograft mouse model 
was also submitted.  
Results of a 4 week repeat dose toxicity study of SB3/BIIB604 by intravenous in cynomolgus monkeys 
(including toxicokinetics on day 1 and 22) were also provided as supportive information (data not shown). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
In  vitro  assays  included  anti-proliferation  assay,  ADCC  and  ADCP  assays.  In  addition,  the  binding 
properties were compared in terms of HER2 binding, Fc receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, 
FcγRIIIb and FcRn) binding and C1q binding.  
Additional biological assays including surface HER2 expression level measurement, HER2 ECD shedding, 
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, in vitro angiogenesis and combination treatment with chemotherapy 
completed the in vitro similarity assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Based on the in vitro data provided, results of the assay showed that the anti-proliferation potency of 
Ontruzant was within the similarity range. The data also support the similar binding and functional 
characteristics in terms of HER2 binding, ADCC activity, ADCP, Fc-related functions, and C1q binding. 
Additional studies performed supported the similar functionality of Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. 
Evaluation of the efficacy of Ontruzant and Herceptin in the treatment of orthotopic BT-474 human breast 
tumour xenograft model 
To evaluate the anti-tumour efficacy of Ontruzant in the orthotopic BT-474 human breast cancer cell 
xenograft model, 10 groups of BT-474 xenograft mice, each consisting of 12 females (9 weeks of age) 
received intravenously Ontruzant formulation buffer (hereinafter, vehicle), Ontruzant, or EU or US 
Herceptin at dose levels of 1, 5, and 15 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks. 
The results (Figure 4) showed that Ontruzant exerted similar effects in terms of tumour growth inhibition 
on Day 36 compared to Herceptin at each same dose level of 1, 5, and 15 mg/kg. Tumour growth 
inhibition was measured by the difference in tumour volume for treated versus vehicle tumour on the last 
day of therapy or harvest day.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided a justification for not providing an environmental risk assessment. Trastuzumab is 
already marketed and no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated with Ontruzant. 
Furthermore, the "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" 
(EMENCHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2*) makes specific reference for certain types of products such as 
Assessment report

proteins, that due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
Therefore, considering that Ontruzant is a protein and there is no expected increased environmental 
exposure, the absence of formal environmental risk assessment studies for Ontruzant is considered 
justified. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  pharmacology  programme  focused  on  primary  pharmacodynamics.  A  set  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
studies was performed to assess any potential differences in biological activity between Ontruzant and 
Herceptin.  Given  that  Ontruzant  is  developed  as  a  biosimilar  and  in  line  with  the  EMA  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005  Rev1),  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology  and 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not deemed necessary. 
The biological and functional similarity of Ontruzant was compared with EU- and US-approved Herceptin 
using  multiple  assays  to  measure  both  the  Fab  and  Fc  functionality.  These  included  measurement  of 
primary mechanism of action involving Fab, i.e., binding to Her-2 receptor and inhibition of proliferation 
of  cells  that  overexpress  Her-2  and  mediation  of  the  effector  functions  of  immune  cells  through  the 
constant region (Fc) of the antibody (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn) and C1q 
binding.  
The in vitro results presented support the biosimilarity of Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. Only FcγRIIa and 
FcγRIIb results appeared slightly lower for Ontruzant compared to Herceptin. The applicant provided a 
comparison of Ontruzant and Herceptin showing similar potential to elicit ADCP. The ADCP assay has been 
described in details and the qualification summary provided is adequate. 
FcγRIIA and FcγIIIA receptors are subject to polymorphism: 2 forms exist for FcγRIIA: 131H and H131R 
depending on histidine or arginine at position 131 and 2 forms for FcγRIIIA: 158V and 158 F depending 
on valine or a phenylalanine at amino-acid position 158. The applicant provided additional comparative 
binding data for isoforms 131H / 131R of receptor FcyRIIa and 158V / 158F for the FcyRIIIA, showing that 
both Ontruzant and EU Herceptin bind the two isoforms with similar affinity by the SPR method.  
Additional biological assays including surface HER2 expression level measurement, HER2 ECD shedding, 
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, in vitro angiogenesis and combination treatment with chemotherapy, 
were also performed and showed similarity between Ontruzant and the reference product.  
An in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) study and an in vivo toxicity study for comparison of Ontruzant with EU 
Herceptin were not required if the quality comparability exercise and the non-clinical in vitro studies were 
considered satisfactory and no critical issues were identified, which is the case for this application. In vivo 
studies including an efficacy study in orthotopic BT-474 human breast cancer cell xenograft mice. The 
therapeutic efficacy of Ontruzant was compared to EU Herceptin and US Herceptin in the BT-474 human 
breast  carcinoma  which  is  characterised  by  the  overexpression  of  HER2  and  oestrogen  receptors. 
Therefore,  the  selected  animal  model  is  deemed  appropriate.  The  anti-tumour  activities  were  found 
similar  between  Ontruzant  and  Herceptin  in  terms  of  tumour  growth  inhibition  (TGI)  rate  (data  not 
shown),  tumour  volume  and  weight  compared  to  vehicle  treated  group.  A  repeat-dose  toxicity  study 
using cynomolgus monkeys was also performed (data not shown) and the data are considered supportive 
of the main pharmacological results.  
There was no information provided on the distribution, elimination, excretion or pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions which is considered acceptable for a biosimilar application.

No local tolerance study and single dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies were conducted for Ontruzant , as such studies are not essential for a similar biological 
product medicinal product (EMA 2006 Guidance [EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005]). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical studies were considered comprehensive and support the comparability exercise 
to confirm the biosimilarity between Ontruzant and the reference product Herceptin.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics comparability data were provided from one single dose PK study SB3-G11-NHV 
conducted in healthy volunteers and one phase III study in patients with Her2+ advanced breast cancer. 
Study SB3-G11-NHV 
The study was a randomised, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single-dose study to compare the 
pharmacokinetics,  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  the  three  formulations  of  Trastuzumab 
(Ontruzant), EU Sourced Herceptin and US Sourced Herceptin) in healthy male subjects.  
The primary objective of this study was to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles 
between Ontruzant and European Union (EU) sourced Herceptin in healthy male subjects. The secondary 
objectives  were  to  investigate  and  compare  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  between 
Ontruzant and EU sourced Herceptin in healthy male subjects. 
This study was initiated in January 2014 (first subject signed informed consent) and completed in April 
2014 (last subject last visit). The study was performed at one centre in Germany.

Figure 5: Schematic diagram representing each arm of the study 
Table 3: Investigational products (IP) 
The single dose of 6 mg/kg (IV infusion for 90 minutes) was followed by a maximum of 8 weeks during 
which the PK, safety, and immunogenicity measurements were made. Mode of administration: IV infusion 
for 90 minutes. 
A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in each of the SB3 and US sourced Herceptin treatment groups, and 
37 subjects were enrolled in the EU sourced Herceptin treatment group. One subject in the EU sourced 
Herceptin treatment group withdrew consent before administration of the IP, and was not included in the 
Safety  set.  Therefore,  there  were  36  subjects in  each  treatment  group included  in  the  Safety  set.  All 
subjects included in the Safety set were also included in the PK population. 
Healthy female subjects were excluded to avoid any risk with formation of anti-trastuzumab antibodies in 
individuals who are more likely to require trastuzumab for the treatment of breast cancer compared to 
healthy male subjects. 
A sample size of 33 completing subjects from each arm of the clinical study will provide 90% power to 
detect a 20% difference in pharmacokinetics between the test product and reference product. This is 
based on an assumption of 5% difference in true geometric mean between test and reference product and 
an inter-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of 24%. This is a two one-sided t-test with 5% significance 
level. A 8% dropout rate is anticipated so approximately 36 subjects in each arm were enrolled.

Blood samples for PK analysis were collected prior to start of infusion and at 0.75, 1.5 (end of infusion), 
3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 336, 672, 1008 and 1344 hours after start of infusion. 
A total of 22.0% of the subjects (30.6% of subjects who received Ontruzant, 13.5% of subjects who 
received EU sourced Herceptin, and 22.2% of subjects who received US sourced Herceptin) had minor 
protocol deviations reported. No subjects had major protocol deviations reported.

Study SB3-G31-BC 
Study SB3-G31-BC is a phase III randomised, Double-Blind, parallel Group, multicentre study to compare 
the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity between Ontruzant (proposed trastuzumab 
biosimilar) and Herceptin in Women with Newly Diagnosed HER2 Positive Early or Locally Advanced Breast 
Cancer  in  Neoadjuvant  Setting.  One  of  the  secondary  parameters  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of Ontruzant compared to Herceptin. 
The PK analyses were performed on the PK Population consisting of 313 subjects (161 subjects in the 
Ontruzant  and  152  subjects  in  the  Herceptin  treatment  groups).  Blood  samples  were  collected  at 
pre-dose of Cycle 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8. All samples collected during the study are listed but the samples which 
were collected post-dose or not collected on the exact scheduled day (a visit window was not allowed for 
the PK analysis) were excluded from the summary statistics and statistical analyses. 
Eleven subjects had quantifiable concentrations at pre-dose of Cycle 1. Those subjects were investigated 
to see whether there was any event that could make quantifiable concentrations at pre-dose of Cycle 1. 
However, none of the subjects had experiences of trastuzumab prior to participation of this study and the 
PK samples of those subjects were collected before start of infusion. Thus, those serum concentrations 
were included in the summary statistics. 
The  statistical  analysis  of  the  log-transformed  Ctrough  at  pre-dose  of  Cycle  8  was  performed  using  the 
analysis of variance model (ANOVA).  
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations related to PK evaluation were defined before database lock as follows; 1) PK blood 
sampling time on or after start of IP infusion time, 2) PK sampling was done but not at the exact scheduled 
date (i.e., 21 days after previous administration of IP), and 3) PK sampling was not done at Cycle 1, 3, 5, 
7, and 8. The data points which meet the protocol deviation definitions were excluded from the descriptive 
statistics and equivalence test but listed. Among 313 subjects who were participating PK evaluation, 166 
subjects (84 subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and 82 subjects in the EU Herceptin treatment 
group) had at least one protocol deviation related to PK. The most frequent protocol deviation was that PK 
sampling  was  done  but  not  at  the  exact  scheduled  date  (158  subjects;  80  subjects  in  the  Ontruzant 
treatment group and 78 subjects in the EU Herceptin treatment group).

Missing data 
In clinical Phase III study of Ontruzant (SB3-G31-BC), PK population consisted of 313 patients (161 
patients in the Ontruzant and 152 patients in the EU Herceptin treatment groups). Nonetheless, 27 to 42 
patients per treatment group were excluded from the analysis of Ctrough by each cycle due to various 
reasons.

A sensitivity analysis excluding the 11 patients excluded from the per protocol set (PPS) in the main study 
population  due  to  it  being  impossible  to  verify  any  source  data.  Excluding  11  patients  having 
non-verifiable data, the proportion of patients with Ctrough exceeding 20 μg/mL was also similar between 
the two treatment groups at each cycle. A total of 99.2% of patients in the Ontruzant treatment group and 
97.2% of patients in the EU Herceptin treatment group had Ctrough values at pre-dose of Cycle 8 greater 
than  20  μg/mL.  The  geometric  least  squares  mean  (GeoLSMean)  ratio  of  Ctrough  between  the  two 
treatment  groups  at  Cycle  8  was  110.343%.  The  90%  CI  was  [101.791%,  119.615%]  which  was 
contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [80%, 125%].

Excluding patients with quantifiable concentration at pre-dose of Cycle 1 
Eleven patients had quantifiable concentration at pre-dose of Cycle 1. The majority of these subjects had 
significant levels of IP detected in the serum, including 5 patients with levels over 100 µg/mL. Per the 
Agency’s  request,  the  Applicant  provided  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  PK  data  excluding  these  eleven 
patients.  Those  subjects  were  investigated  to  see  whether  there  was  any  event  that  could  make 
quantifiable  concentrations  at  pre-dose  of  Cycle  1. However,  none  of  the  patients  had  experiences  of 
trastuzumab prior to participation of this study and the PK samples of those patients were collected before 
start  of  infusion.  Excluding  eleven  subjects  having  quantifiable  pre-dose  concentration,  mean  Ctrough 
collected after IP administration was similar between the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment groups from 
Cycles 3 to 8. Variability in trough concentrations was also similar in Ctrough collected from Cycle 3 to Cycle 
8. The proportion of subjects with Ctrough exceeding 20 μg/mL was similar between the treatment groups 
at each cycle. A total of 99.2% of subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and 97.2% of subjects in the 
Herceptin treatment group had Ctrough values at pre-dose of Cycle 8 greater than 20 μg/mL. The geometric 
least squares mean ratio of Ctrough between the two treatment groups at Cycle 8 was 108.158%. The 90% 
CI was [99.828%, 117.184%], which was contained within the predefined equivalence margin of [80%, 
125%]. From the above results of sensitivity analysis, PK parameters were comparable between the two 
treatment groups even when 11 patients with quantifiable concentrations of IP at pre-dose of Cycle 1 
were excluded. 
Excluding patients with irregular/non-verifiable data 
The applicant provided a sensitivity analysis of the PK data in study SB3-G31-BC, excluding all 22 patients 
with irregular/non-verifiable data (i.e. the 11 patients with quantifiable baseline pre-dose concentrations 
of IP and the additional 11 patients excluded from the PPS). 
The proportion of patients with Ctrough exceeding 20 μg/mL was similar between the two treatment groups 
at each cycle. A total of 99.2% of patients in the Ontruzant treatment group and 97.1% of patients in the 
EU Herceptin treatment group had Ctrough values at pre-dose of Cycle 8 greater than 20 μg/mL 
The geometric least squares mean (GeoLSMean) ratio of Ctrough between the two treatment groups at 
Cycle 8 was 108.586%. The 90% CI was [100.023%, 117.881%] which was contained within the 
pre-defined equivalence margin of [80%, 125%]. 
From the above results of sensitivity analysis, PK parameters were comparable between the two 
treatment groups even when all 22 patients with irregular/non-verifiable data were excluded. 
Impact of Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) on PK parameters  
In  the  study  SB3-G11-NHV,  there  was  no  indication  of  immunogenicity  in  the  population  of  healthy 
volunteers after administration of Ontruzant or Herceptin as no detectable ADA was seen. This absence of 
ADA was expected following a single dose being administered in healthy subjects. 
In the study SB3-G31-BC, within the PK population, one subject in the Ontruzant treatment group and no 
subject in the Herceptin treatment group were reported to have an ADA positive result up to Cycle 9. One 
subject had a positive result of ADA at Cycle 5 pre-dose and negative results at other time points. The 
serum trough concentration at Cycle 5 was relatively low at 15.46 μg/mL but within the range of 14.71 to 
102.79 μg/mL of the cycle. The trough concentrations (46.35 and 56.08 μg/mL for Cycle 7 and Cycle 8, 
respectively) in the later cycles were similar to other subjects (ranging from 22.98 to 175.02 μg/mL and 
from 19.00 to 189.70 μg/mL for Cycle 7 and Cycle 8, respectively). Due to the low incidence of positive 
ADA results, the impact of the presence of ADA up to Cycle 9 on the PK cannot be compared.

Two subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and one subject in the Herceptin treatment group were 
reported  to  have  pre-existing  positive  ADA  results.  The  serum  trough  concentrations  of  subjects  with 
pre-existing ADA were similar to the trough concentrations in the corresponding treatment groups and 
cycles.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
See discussion on clinical pharmacology. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
With respect to the clinical pharmacokinetics, the development program to assess the similarity between 
Ontruzant and Herceptin is in general adequate and was performed according to the guidance on similar 
biological products and the recommendations given in the national and CHMP Scientific Advice. The 
comparability exercise was performed between EU/US sourced reference products and the formulation of 
Ontruzant intended to be marketed in the European Union.  
The Ontruzant PK program consists of one pivotal phase I study carried out in healthy subjects (Clinical 
Study SB3-G11-NHV) and the PK data collected in the pivotal phase III study SB3-G31-BC in patients with 
HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) in neoadjuvant setting.  
The single dose PK study SB3-G11-NHV is judged appropriate and the clinical site is judged GCP 
compliant. In the case of a monoclonal antibody with per definition a long half-life and a potential of 
immunogenicity, a parallel design for the single dose study SB3-G11-NHV is accepted. The subject 
population including male volunteers has been selected with the aim of minimizing variability and 
permitting detection of differences between pharmaceutical products. This is considered a sensitive 
population for comparative investigation of PK. A single dose is considered sufficient to detect any 
difference in clearance. Given that the clearance is independent of dose in the therapeutic dose range, 
any dose in this range is suitable for the study. The single dose of 6 mg/kg in intravenous infusion (over 
90 minutes) is judged adequate based on the posology of the reference product as this corresponds to a 
widely used treatment schedule in patients who receive an initial 8 mg/kg loading dose followed by a 
maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every 3rd week.  
The sample size is adequate and has been selected to account for potential dropouts and provided 90% 
power overall, a true geometric mean ratio between 95 and 105% and a 8% dropout rate. The power 
calculation  is  for  a  90%  CI  around  the  GMR  to  be  in  the  80-125%  range  with  an  alpha=0.05.  Inter- 
subject  CV%  was  similar  across  the  three  treatment  groups.  When  sample  size  was  calculated, 
inter-subject CV% was expected to be 24%. The actual inter-subject CV% derived from this study was 
smaller than the expected value. 
A sufficient number of samples to adequately characterise the whole profile were collected, with sufficient 
sampling around predicted Tmax to provide reliable estimate of peak exposure. Even if the length of the 
study is relatively short in view of the half-life of trastuzumab (approx. 22 days in volunteers), a blood 
sampling carried out over a period of 8 weeks is accepted for characterisation of the elimination phase as

the sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration time curve long enough to provide a reliable 
estimate of the extent of exposure which is achieved as AUC(0-t) covers at least 80% of AUC(0-∞). 
In the phase I PK study SB3-G11-NHV, the pharmacokinetics for  Ontruzant (SB3) and Herceptin showed 
comparability between the two products as the ratios (90% CI) of geometric means for primary PK 
endpoints AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax were 0.971, 0.969 and 1.001, respectively and hence were all within 
the acceptance range of 80-125%.  
Per request, the secondary PK parameters (Vz, λz, CL, %AUCextrap, Tmax, and t1/2) were compared using a 
pre-defined equivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25. Secondary PK parameters support biosimilarity in terms of 
pharmacokinetics between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. It is noted that the mean T max value for 
Ontruzant was slightly longer compared to EU- and US-sourced Herceptin (4.69 hours versus 3.53 and 
2.80 hours respectively), probably due to 3 patients with outlying very high recorded Tmax results. When 
these 3 outliers are excluded from the analysis, the median Tmax values and ranges were similar between 
groups and the geometric LSMean ratios in AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax remained within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25 (data not shown). No explanation is available to substantiate the 
unusual second peaks observed after the completion of the intravenous infusion in some subjects. This 
observation has been described for Herceptin in the past but to a lesser extent (Tmax=24 hours) (Wynee 
et al., 2013) while an unusual high Tmax= 96 hours was observed for Ontruzant in study SB3-G11-NHV. 
Nevertheless, this issue does not compromise the final conclusions of PK similarity between Ontruzant 
and Herceptin, Tmax being a secondary parameter less clinically relevant when Ontruzant is used in the 
current indications.  
In the phase III study SB3-G31-BC, a statistical analysis of the log-transformed Ctrough at pre-dose of 
Cycle 8 was performed using ANOVA. Mean pre-dose serum trough concentration (Ctrough) profiles up to 
Cycle 8 suggest the two treatments show similar Ctrough profiles over time in patients. The minimum target 
concentration of 20 µg/ml established for trastuzumab was reached at cycle 3 for both products. Steady 
state appeared to be reached at Cycle 7.  
Several sensitivity analyses of the PK data were provided excluding the 11 patients having non-verifiable 
data;  11  patients  with  quantifiable  concentration  at  pre-dose  of  Cycle  1;  all  22  patients  with 
irregular/non-verifiable data. Overall, PK parameters were comparable between the two treatments in all 
sensitivity analyses. 
The conduct of study SB3-G31-BC for the PK subset was considered acceptable. The number, type and 
distribution of protocol deviations were balanced across the treatment groups. The reasons for the 
number of patients with missing Ctrough data at cycles 3 to 8 was adequately investigated. Numbers of 
patients with missing Ctrough data at each time point were generally comparable between the two 
treatment groups. The corresponding reasons for missing Ctrough data were also comparable at each 
timepoint. Within each treatment group, there were some fluctuations on numeric numbers. However, no 
trend of data exclusion could be observed throughout the timepoints in study SB3-G31-BC. Therefore, the 
results from the PK comparability are found to be reliable. 
To  evaluate  shed  antigen’s  potential  impact  on  PK  profile  of  Ontruzant,  relationship  between  log 
transformed Ctrough and log transformed baseline HER2 level (generally higher than Cycle 8 serum HER2 
level) in PK population with Ontruzant were investigated at each cycle. The serum HER2 levels between 
the two treatment groups were comparable at the time-point of Cycle 1 (Baseline) and Cycle 8. There 
appeared to be a weak correlation at Cycle 3, but no correlation at other cycles. Therefore, shed antigen 
did not have a significant impact on the PK profile of Ontruzant (data not shown). 
No analyses were provided in the special populations which is acceptable considering the biosimilar relies 
on the information already known of the reference product. No formal drug-drug interaction studies are 
judged needed.

To date no validated PD biomarkers exist for trastuzumab efficacy and consequently no clinical 
comparability PD studies have been performed with Ontruzant. Studies on the mechanism of action were 
not provided which is acceptable for a biosimilar. 
With regards to immunogenicity data, the applicant has provided further justification for the very low ADA 
incident rates seen in both treatment arms of the SB3-G31-BC clinical study. Namely the additional HER2 
depletion step used which can lower the false positive rate in ADA determination from HER2 level in the 
serum,  and  lower  incidence  rates  seen  in  another  recent  clinical  trial.  In  addition,  the  applicant  has 
appropriately addressed the concerns raised regarding the capability of the immunogenicity assays used 
to detect all antibody positive samples. Therefore, the assay is considered reliable to detect antibodies to 
Ontruzant and to EU Herceptin with equivalent extent. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data support the comparability exercise between Ontruzant and the reference 
product Herceptin. It is considered that similarity, from a PK perspective, has been established.

Treatments 
Investigative and comparison treatments 
Ontruzant and Herceptin administered every 3 weeks for a total of 18 cycles (8 cycles of neoadjuvant 
therapy and 10 cycles of adjuvant therapy) unless Investigator-assessed clinical disease progression or 
recurrence of disease, or intolerable toxicity occurred. Ontruzant or Herceptin was administered 
intravenously at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg and at a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg for the subsequent 
cycles. 
Neo-adjuvant chemo-therapy 
All patients received 75 mg/m2 docetaxel given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 4 cycles of FEC 
(5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) given every 3 
weeks. 
After  completing  the  cycles,  patients  underwent  surgery  and  subsequently  received  an  additional  10 
cycles of intravenous trastuzumab as per randomisation to complete 1 year of treatment.

After completion of the adjuvant therapy, patients were followed up for additional 30 days after the last 
dose of IP to the end of study (EOS) visit. Radiotherapy was administered as per local practice. Hormone 
receptor-positive patients could receive adjuvant hormonal therapy as per local practice.

Objectives 
Primary 
To demonstrate comparable clinical efficacy between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin, by means of pathologic 
complete response (pCR) rate of the primary breast tumour in women with HER2 positive EBC or LABC in 
the neoadjuvant setting.  
Secondary 
To evaluate the efficacy of Ontruzant compared to EU Herceptin by total pathological complete response 
(tpCR) rate, overall clinical response rate, event-free survival and overall survival.  
To evaluate comparable safety / tolerability, PK and immunogenicity between Ontruzant and EU 
Herceptin.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was pathological complete response rate of the primary breast tumour. pCR was 
defined as no histological evidence of residual invasive tumour cells in the breast specimen removed at 
surgery [bpCR]. Non-invasive breast residuals were allowed and the pathological examination of axillary 
lymph nodes was not to be considered; ypT0/is, ypN0/+. 
The difference in bpCR rate was analysed for the primary analysis. Equivalence was declared when the 
95% CI of the difference in the bpCR rate between treatments was entirely contained within the 
equivalence margin of [−13%, 13%]. The 95% CIs for the difference were estimated in the Per-protocol 
Set (PPS).

• 
Total pathological complete response. tpCR was defined as the absence of invasive residual 
tumour cells in both breast and lymph nodes. 
•  Overall clinical response rate during neoadjuvant therapy (by RECIST criteria). The overall clinical 
response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects achieving cCR or cPR for the best overall 
response during the neoadjuvant therapy period.  
• 
Event-free survival, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date where an 
event occurred. An event was disease recurrence or progression (local, regional, distant or 
contralateral) or death due to any cause. 
•  Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death, 
regardless of the cause of death. Subjects who were alive at the time of analysis were censored 
at the date of the last follow-up assessment. 
Breast and total pCR (tpCR) 
Pathological complete response was assessed by the local pathologist. For pCR quality control, pCR 
results of selected samples were reviewed by the study Pathologist Board. The role of the pathologist 
board review was to check data accuracy and consistency and to check overall quality of pCR assessment 
procedure by reviewing both local pathology report (LPR) used in the investigator site and pathology 
report worksheet (PRW) provided for this study. The sponsor’s clinical research physician and medical 
advisor monitored periodically the pCR data (pCR form of Post-Surgery sheet) extracted from eCRF (all 
entered till cut-off) to search out pCR cases entered by Investigator sites. Missing responses were treated 
as failures. 
Clinical tumour response 
Clinical tumour response was assessed using the criteria for clinical response evaluation modified from 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the latter which was modified to the neoadjuvant 
setting in as much as clinical tumour response was measured using assessment by ultrasound or caliper 
in order to achieve consistency in tumour assessments across sites. In subjects with inflammatory breast 
cancer, the measurement of breast tumour size was not available and thus they were not included in the 
analysis population for clinical response evaluation. 
If there was suspicion of disease progression based on clinical findings before the scheduled tumour 
assessment, an unscheduled assessment was performed. If a lesion showed clear signs of progression, 
the subject was removed from study and provided with the local standard of care.

Sample size 
To calculate the equivalence margin, neoadjuvant studies randomised to receive Herceptin in 
combination with taxane- and/or anthracycline-containing chemotherapies or only chemotherapies 
without Herceptin were searched. There were only 3 studies found from the literature that randomised to 
include a non-Herceptin control arm with bpCR reported in subjects treated with these regimens. 
The Buzdar and Chang studies included only operable EBC subjects with stage II to III with resulting bpCR 
rates of 65% (26% for non-Herceptin group) and 31% (9% for non-Herceptin group), respectively, and 
the NOAH study included only LABC patients in reporting a bpCR rate of 43% (22% for non-Herceptin 
group). 
Two analyses were implemented to compare the primary endpoint, one on the ratio of bpCR rates and one 
on the difference of bpCR rates between the biosimilar and reference product in the per protocol set. 
Table 14: Breast pCR rates from reference studies, SB3-G31-BC 
The ratio of bpCR rates was calculated at 2.07 with the 90% CI of [1.546, 2.795] from meta-analysis 
using the above three references. The asymmetric equivalence margin for the ratio of bpCR rates was 
calculated as [0.785, 1.546] where the lower limit was preserved at least 50% of Herceptin treatment 
effect over the placebo, i.e., 0.785 = 1/(1+0.5×(1.546-1)). The upper equivalence limit of 1.546 was 
taken from the lower limit of 90% CI of the ratio between treatments. 
With the expected bpCR rate of 37.5%, 358 subjects per arm should be evaluable in terms of bpCR to 
meet 80% power to detect the equivalence within the margin of [0.785, 1.546] under the assumption of 
no difference between two treatments in terms of bpCR rate. 
The difference of bpCR rates between treatments was calculated as 23.3% with the 80% CI of [16.6%, 
29.9%] from meta-analysis using the three reference studies. The equivalence margin for the difference 
was derived as 13% (= 16.6%×0.8). 
Given that 236 subjects were to be randomised in each group to achieve the 80% power with 13% margin 
and 37.5% expected bpCR rate for the difference-based approach, the sample size of 358 per group 
derived from the ratio-based approach would satisfy both primary analyses for the ratio and difference of 
bpCR rates. 
Considering the non-evaluable cases for pCR (e.g., inoperable cases), 403 subjects per treatment group 
(overall 806 subjects) were to be randomised into the study and, incorporating an 11% drop-out rate, 
would mean 358 subjects per treatment group would have assessable tumour cells to meet the 80% 
power to detect the equivalence within the margin of [0.785, 1.546].

Randomisation 
Randomisation to either Ontruzant or Herceptin in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by hormone 
receptor status and disease stage. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double- blinded. Ontruzant or Herceptin presented as a white to pale yellow lyophilised 
powder. Ontruzant or Herceptin was provided as a single vial of 150 mg. These were pre-packaged and 
labelled in a double-blinded form. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Enrolled Set (ENR): The ENR consisted of all subjects who provided informed consent for this study. 
Randomised Set (RAN): The RAN consisted of all subjects who received a randomisation number at the 
Randomisation Visit. For analyses and displays based on the RAN, subjects were classified according to 
the treatment they were assigned at randomisation. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS consisted of all subjects who were randomised at the Randomisation 
Visit. Following the intent-to-treat principle, subjects were analysed according to the treatment they were 
assigned at randomisation. However, subjects who did not qualify for randomisation and were 
inadvertently randomised into the study were excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects did not 
receive IP during that study phase. 
Per-protocol Set (PPS): The PPS consisted of all FAS subjects who completed the 8 cycles of 
neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. The PPS was the primary analysis set. Major protocol deviations that 
led to exclusion from this set were pre-specified prior to unblinding the treatment codes for analyses. 
Subjects who did not have a pathological response assessment were excluded from the PPS. 
Safety Set (SAF): The SAF consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study 
drug during the study phase. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment received. 
Primary variable analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis aimed to demonstrate equivalence in the bpCR rate between Ontruzant and 
Herceptin treatment groups. The null hypothesis tested for the primary efficacy analysis was that either 
(1) Ontruzant is inferior to Herceptin or (2) Ontruzant is superior to Herceptin based on a pre-specified 
equivalence margin. 
To demonstrate equivalence in the bpCR rate between the two treatment groups in accordance with both 
FDA and EMA recommendations, the ratio and the difference in bpCR rate were analysed for the primary 
analysis. Equivalence was declared if the 90% confidence interval (CI; instead of 95% CI as specified in 
the protocol) of the ratio in the bpCR rate between the two treatment groups was entirely contained 
within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [0.785, 1.546] or equivalence was declared if the 95% CI of 
the difference in the bpCR rate between treatments was entirely contained within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of ± 13%. 
The adjusted difference in bpCR rate (Ontruzant -Herceptin) between the two treatment groups was 
calculated using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and 95% Wald CIs were presented; the 
adjusted ratio in bpCR rate (Ontruzant /Herceptin) and its 90% CIs were also calculated using a stratified 
Assessment report

CMH test. The stratification factors for CMH tests were hormone receptor status, breast cancer type and 
region. 
Primary analyses were conducted using the PPS. 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the primary efficacy 
result: 
1. Stratified CMH test used for the primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the FAS where subjects with 
missing bpCR assessment were regarded as non-responders. 
2. The stratum-adjusted difference in bpCR rate between the two treatment groups and its 95% CIs was 
calculated using an identity-linked binomial model, and the stratum-adjusted ratio in bpCR rate between 
the two treatment groups and its 90% CIs was calculated using log-linked binomial model, including 
stratification factors of hormone receptor status, breast cancer type and region for the PPS. 
3. The crude difference in bpCR rate between the two treatment groups and its 95% CIs, and crude ratio 
in bpCR rate between the two treatment groups and its 90% CIs were calculated using Chi-square test for 
the PPS. 
In addition, the adjusted ratio in bpCR rate (Ontruzant /Herceptin) and its 95% CIs were calculated using 
a stratified CMH test as an additional analysis to support the primary efficacy result. The 95% CIs were 
compared to the pre-defined equivalence margin of [0.785, 1.546]. 
Secondary variable analysis 
The secondary variables of tpCR and overall response rate were analysed similarly to the primary 
variable. For time to event variables, Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated and displayed. Median survival 
times and the corresponding 95% CI and p-value were provided. The estimated hazard ratio with 95% CI 
and p-value was obtained from a Cox regression model. 
All efficacy variables were summarised descriptively by treatment group for PPS and FAS. Efficacy data 
were also listed by subject.

Protocol amendments 
Five global amendments and 4 country-specific amendments were made to the original protocol (dated 
Nov 08, 2013). The Amendment 5 is dated Apr 23, 2015.  
Under Amendment 4.1 (Dec 17, 2014), determination of sample size and its rationale was updated as a 
result of newly found literature and references added to the bibliography. The expected bpCR rate was 
changed from 40% to 37.5%, the number of evaluable subjects to meet an 80% power changed from 220 
to 358 subjects per arm and the equivalence margin changed from within 15% to 0.785 to 1.546. The 
number of subjects to be randomised was therefore changed from 249 to 403 per arm and the expected 
dropout rate changed from 12% to 11%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 48/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of subjects to be randomised was increased from 498 to 806 and the expected recruitment 
period increased from 12 to 15 months.  
The  criteria  for  declaring  equivalence  between  the  two  treatments  (primary  efficacy  endpoint)  was 
modified from “Equivalence between the two treatment groups will be declared if the two-sided 95% (CI) 
of the difference in the pCR rate between treatments is entirely contained within the equivalence margin 
of [-15%, 15%]. The two-sided 95% CI of the difference will be estimated for the PPS” to: 
“To demonstrate equivalence in the pCR rate between the two treatment groups in accordance with both 
FDA and EMA recommendation, the ratio and the difference in pCR rate will be analysed for the primary 
analysis. Equivalence will be declared if the two-sided 95% (CI) of the ratio in the pCR rate between 
treatments is entirely contained within the equivalence margin of [0.785, 1.546] or, if the 95% CI of the 
difference  in  the  pCR  rate  between  treatments  is  entirely  contained  within  the  equivalence  margin  of 
[-13%, 13%]. The 95% CIs of the difference will be estimated for the PPS. The difference of pCR will be 
used for EMA submission and the relative ratio of pCR will be used for FDA submission”. 
The PK Population definition was revised from the one specified in the protocol to take into consideration 
any subjects whose samples were collected but not analysed for any reason (including regional issues in 
Eastern Ukraine), resulting in no serum trough concentration data. These subjects were not to be included 
in the PK Population.

Due to regional issues in the Eastern Ukraine, it was decided before database lock to exclude 11 
randomised subjects (6 received Ontruzant and 5 received Herceptin) from two sites from the PPS since 
it was impossible to conduct any source data verification activities for these subjects. No subjects from 
any other centres were excluded from the PPS due to issues with verifying the integrity of the data.

Medical/surgical history 
A similar number of subjects in the Ontruzant and Herceptin groups (384 [87.9%] vs. 384 [87.7%], 
respectively) had medical and surgical histories and continuing medical conditions in any primary SOC. In 
general, the distribution of medical and surgical history and continuing medical conditions was 
comparable on the SOC level between the two treatment groups.  
Prior and concomitant medication 
A similar proportion of patients in the Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups (25.2% vs. 24.2% of 
patients, respectively) had taken medications which started and stopped prior to the study. 
The use of concomitant medications by ATC drug class was comparable between the two treatment 
groups. All patients received at least one concomitant medication during the overall study period and 
during the neoadjuvant therapy period; during the adjuvant therapy period 88.8% in both treatment 
groups received concomitant medications.

Surgery 
Table 21: Summary of primary surgery (randomised set), SB3-G31-BC 
Radiation therapy 
During the adjuvant therapy period, 227 (51.9%) patients in the Ontruzant treatment group and 219 
(50.0%) patients in the EU Herceptin treatment group received at least one radiation therapy. The 
proportion of patients receiving whole breast radiation, whole chest wall radiation, and regional node 
radiation was comparable between the Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups. 
Hormone therapy 
Patients who were hormone-receptor positive received hormonal therapy after primary surgery. During 
the adjuvant therapy period, 185 (42.3%) patients in the Ontruzant treatment group and 169 (38.6%) 
patients in the EU Herceptin treatment group received hormone therapy. The various hormonal treatment 
options were well balanced between the two treatment groups. The most frequently received hormonal 
treatment was tamoxifen/tamoxifen citrate (130 [29.7%] subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and 
126 [28.8%] subjects in the Herceptin treatment group). Other frequently received hormonal treatments 
were letrozole (35 [8.0%] and 26 [5.9%], respectively) and anastrozole (20 [4.6%] and 17 [3.9%], 
respectively). Among the gonadotropin and analogues class, goserelin/goserelin acetate was the most 
frequently reported drug (20 [4.6%] subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and 17 [3.9%] subjects 
in the Herceptin treatment group).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results 
The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  bpCR  was  51.7%  and  42.0%  in  the  Ontruzant  and  Herceptin
treatment groups, respectively, for the PPS.  
For the FAS analysis set, 51.1% and 41.9% reached bpCR respectively.  
The  adjusted  difference  in  bpCR  rate  for  the  PPS  was  10.70%  and  the  95%  CI  of  the  difference  was 
[4.13%, 17.26%], which was not contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [–13%, 13%]. 
The  adjusted  difference  in  bpCR  rate  for  the  FAS  was  9.86%  and  the  95%  CI  of  the  difference  was 
[3.41%, 16.31%], which was not contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [–13%, 13%].

In order to establish the sensitivity of the primary efficacy outcomes, the same analyses for ratio and 
difference in imputed bpCR were performed for the FAS. In these analyses, subjects with a missing bpCR 
assessment were considered to be non-responders. 
Using the non-responder analysis the proportion of subjects achieving bpCR was 49.0% for the Ontruzant 
and 39.7% for the Herceptin treatment groups.  
Using  the  non-responder  analysis  the  adjusted  difference  and  its  95%  CI  in  bpCR  rate  was  9.59% 
[3.26%, 15.91%], which was not contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [–13%, 13%]. 
Additionally  the  stratum-adjusted  difference  in  bpCR  rate  between  the  two  treatment  groups  and 
corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using a log-linked binomial model, including stratification factors 
of hormones receptor status, breast cancer type and region for the PPS. 
The adjusted difference and its 95% CI in bpCR rate was 9.78% [2.90%, 16.66%] which fell outside the 
pre-defined equivalence margin for the difference in bpCR rates. 
Finally  crude  differences  and  95%  CIs  were  calculated  using  Chi-square  tests  for  the  PPS.  The  crude 
difference  and  its  95%  CI  was  9.78%  and  [2.90%,  16.66%],  which  fell  outside  the  predefined 
equivalence margin for the difference. 
Given that all sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary analyses outcomes, the robustness in veracity of 
the latter is confirmed. 
Total pathological clinical response 
Analysis of difference in tpCR rate 
The proportion of subjects achieving tpCR was 45.8% (175/382) and 35.8% (136/380) in the Ontruzant 
and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively, for the PPS.  
For the FAS, the proportion of subjects achieving tpCR was 45.2% and 35.8% respectively. 
Analysis of the FAS using the non-responder analysis saw the proportion of subjects achieving tpCR to be 
41.2% and 32.4% respectively. 
Thus the tpCR results confirmed the effects seen in the primary bpCR analyses.

Since measurement of breast tumour size was not available, subjects with inflammatory breast cancer 
were not included into the analysis population for clinical response evaluation. The proportion of these 
particular subjects with clinical disease progression was 6.7% in both treatment groups. 
The results in the PPS set for the ratio and differences are provided in the table below. 
Table 29: Analysis of difference in overall response rate (PPS), SB3-G31-BC  
In the FAS (available case analysis) the overall response rate was 94.9% (394/415) for the Ontruzant and 
91.1% (368/404) for the Herceptin treatment groups, respectively. The adjusted difference in overall 
response rate was 3.68% and the 95% CI of the difference was [0.32%, 7.03%]. 
When the non-responder analysis was applied, the overall response rate was 93.6% (394/421) for the 
Ontruzant and 87.0% (368/423) for the Herceptin treatment groups, respectively. The adjusted 
difference in overall response rate was 5.94% and the 95% CI of the adjusted difference was [2.17%, 
9.71%]. 
Event-free survival and Overall survival 
The median follow-up duration was 437 days (range 94-593 days) in the Ontruzant treatment group and 
438 days (range 24-651 days) in the Herceptin treatment group.

By ADA status 
As the overall incidence of ADA was markedly low in both Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment groups (only 
3 patients, all in the Ontruzant group, up to cycle 9 had an overall positive ADA result) the relationship 
between immunogenicity and treatment efficacy could not be statistically analysed.

By history of breast cancer 
As expected, the bpCR rate in the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment groups was higher in subjects who 
were ER and PR negative (60.1% and 53.0% in the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment group, 
respectively) than subjects who were ER and/or PR positive (46.9% vs. 33.9% in the Ontruzant and 
Herceptin treatment group, respectively). The bpCR rate was slightly higher in subjects with locally 
advanced breast cancer (54.7% and 43.8% in the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment group, 
respectively) than in subjects with operable breast cancer (49.8% and 40.8% in the Ontruzant and 
Herceptin treatment group, respectively).

Supportive information 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is mediated by tumor cell surface binding of 
trastuzumab and its interaction with Fc-gamma (Fcγ) receptors on immune cells. As the binding of 
trastuzumab to FcγRIIIa is correlated to the degree of fucosylation in the antibody’s Fc part, this effect 
can be controlled through the testing of afucosylated (aFuc) glycan content. A large body of non-clinical 
evidence has demonstrated the key role that the core fucose on glycans plays in in vitro ADCC activity. 
The absence of the core fucose imparts higher ADCC activity to the antibody (Shields et al. 2002, 
Shinkawa et al. 2003). Afucosylated trastuzumab (100%) had significantly enhanced ADCC, compared 
with the fucosylated antibody, when tested using peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) from 
either normal donors or breast cancer patients (Suzuki et al. 2007). Recent studies have demonstrated, 
using mouse models of HER2 amplified breast cancer, that afucosylated trastuzumab has increased ADCC 
and more than doubled the median progression-free survival in mice, when compared with conventional 
trastuzumab (i.e., low in afucoslyated glycan forms) (Junttila et al. 2010).  
After similarity assessment between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin was completed, additional Herceptin 
lots were analysed by the applicant for monitoring purposes. During this analysis, it was noted that for 
many of the more recent batches of EU Herceptin (starting from the lots with expiry dates of Oct 2018) 
and US Herceptin (lots with expiry dates from Aug 2018), apparent shifts were found in terms of ADCC 
activity.  
The overall contribution of ADCC activity versus antiproliferative effects through inhibition of 
ligand-independent HER2 signalling on the therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab is not known. However, the 
apparent shift in ADCC activity might have contributed to the small observed differences in the efficacy of 
Ontruzant compared to EU Herceptin. 
For a better understanding of these effects an analysis by ADCC status was conducted using bpCR results 
stratification approach, the results of which are shown in Table 39.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme to assess biosimilarity in terms of efficacy and safety between 
Ontruzant and Herceptin is based on a single Phase III study in women with newly diagnosed HER2 
positive early or locally advanced breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.  
The choice of EB/LABC in neo- and adjuvant setting for the comparability study is considered a sensitive 
population and sufficient homogeneity is expected in an early clinical setting. The choice of the indication, 
the clinical setting, the primary and secondary endpoints and the equivalence margin were endorsed in 
CHMP Scientific Advice. This clinical model was considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of 
differences between the two products.  
The protocol defined inclusion criteria prevented men from participating in the study. Breast cancer in 
males is very rare and there is evidence that this population has a different clinical profile versus female 
breast cancer. Therefore, including them in the trial would have impacted the homogeneity of the study.  
The applicant selected the same sequential combination chemotherapy regimen as used in the HannaH 
study which investigated the comparability of SC trastuzumab and IV trastuzumab in neoadjuvant setting 
in  patients  with  operable,  locally  advanced  or  inflammatory  breast  cancer  (Ismael,  2012).  The 
chemotherapy  backbone  was  also  identical  to  HannaH  study  and  was  chosen  based  on  reported  pCR 
rates. There were no universal consensus for chemotherapy regimen and several clinical studies have 
been conducted to investigate the role of trastuzumab in neoadjuvant setting. The choice of docetaxel 
instead of paclitaxel is viewed as acceptable alternative in Europe and its dose was reduced from the 
registered dose of 100 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² to improve tolerability. A potential impact on pCR due to 
lower  dose  used  would  occur  to  a  similar  extent  in  both  treatment  arms  and  is  acceptable  for 
comparability purposes. The co-administration of anthracyclines with trastuzumab was justified by the 
fact  that  in  contrast  to  the  early  experiences  in  MBC,  simultaneous  neoadjuvant  therapy  with 
anthracyclines and Herceptin appears to have an acceptable cardiac toxicity profile 
The pCR is generally regarded as a sensitive endpoint for similarity comparisons. The primary efficacy 
endpoint in the pivotal study was the proportion of patients achieving bpCR. The choice of bpCR was 
justified by a possible occurrence of more confounding factors in determining tpCR rate and such 
approach was considered acceptable given that tpCR was included as secondary endpoint in this study.  
Five global amendments and 4 country-specific amendments were made to the original protocol (dated 
Nov 08, 2013). Under Amendment 4.1, determination of sample size and its rationale was updated as a 
result  of  newly  found  literature  and  references  added  to  the  bibliography  and  recommendations  of 
regulatory authorities. The tightening of the equivalence margin from 95% CI within [-15%, 15%] to 
95% CI within [-13%, 13%] resulted in more stringent criteria to claim similarity. The chosen equivalence 
margin (95% CI within [-13%, 13%]) was deemed acceptable following CHMP scientific advice if quality, 
non-clinical and PK data did not indicate any difference between Ontruzant and Herceptin. 
The  number  of  patients  with  major  protocol  deviation  was  relatively  balanced  across  the  treatment 
groups. A total of 37 (4.2%) subjects were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations.  
Six patients having received Ontruzant and five having received Herceptin, all enrolled and treated at 2 
centres in the Ukraine, were excluded from the PPS as source data verification was impossible and thus 
data integrity could not be ensured. No other subjects from any other centre presented with similar data 
issues. The decision to exclude the patients from these 2 centres is endorsed as the number of patients 
Assessment report

enrolled in these centres represent a very small portion of the total study population and is also balanced 
across the 2 treatment groups. 
The routine GCP inspection that was conducted on this study concluded that the results of this trial can be 
used for evaluation and assessment of the MAA.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms.  
The  proportion  of  patients  achieving  bpCR  in  the  subset  of  EU  Herceptin  group  never  exposed  to 
ADCC-shifted  Herceptin  was  44.1%,  while  that  of  the  212  excluded  patients  was  40.1%.  This  small 
difference possibly associated with shifts in ADCC activity is viewed as  not being clinically significant 
given  the  small  magnitude  and  the  unlikely  impact  of  small  changes  in  bpCR  on  clinically  relevant 
time-dependent clinical endpoints.  
In  the  case  of  Ontruzant,  it  is  likely  that  the  apparent  difference  is  confounded  by  the  shift  in  ADCC 
activity. The shift may have added variability in the estimation of the treatment difference and is thought 
to have contributed to the apparent superiority of Ontruzant in terms of bpCR and the upper limit of the 
confidence interval slightly exceeding the pre-specified equivalence margins (95% CI: 4.13%, 17.26%; 
equivalence  margins:  -13%,  13%).  Thus,  the  magnitude  of  the  differences  observed  can  be  in  part 
attributed  to  other  factors  and  the  true  difference  is  considered  likely  to  fall  within  the  equivalence 
margins and of no clinical relevance.  In conclusion, Ontruzant is not considered superior to Herceptin in 
terms of efficacy and equivalence in efficacy is considered sufficiently established.   
The  applicant  provided  OS  and  EFS  data  at  1  year  of  treatment.  No  statistical  difference  in  these 
endpoints  was  observed  between  the  Ontruzant  and  Herceptin  groups.  Furthermore,  there  were  no 
clinically  meaningful  differences  in  safety  profile  identified  in  the  safety  population  which  and  this 
provides further reassurance in regard to similarity between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin. The Applicant 
will follow up events (disease recurrence or death) over 5 years after end of study (EOS) as part of the 
extension study for cardiac safety (SB3-G31-BC-E) (see RMP).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given the data submitted and the consideration above, similarity between Ontruzant and Herceptin in 
terms of efficacy is considered sufficiently established.  
Herceptin  is  authorised  in  the  treatment  of  HER2-positive  MBC,  early  breast  cancer,  and  metastatic 
gastric cancer. The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and the target 
receptor involved is also the same in early breast cancer, metastatic gastric cancer and MBC (i.e., HER2). 
Results  of  the  physico-chemical,  structural,  and  biological  characterisation  studies  together  with  the 
evidence  from  non-clinical  studies  and  PK  study  SB3-G11-NHV  support  extrapolation  to  the  other 
oncology indications. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Key safety information is derived from the clinical Phase III study (SB3-G31-BC) in EBC or LABC patients, 
supported by the safety/tolerability profile from the clinical Phase I study (SB3-G11-NHV) in healthy male 
subjects. The main study was completed (1 year data).

Patient exposure 
Study SB3-G31-BC 
In this randomised phase III study, women with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) or LABC were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ontruzant or Herceptin in a neoadjuvant setting for 8 cycles 
concurrently  with  8  cycles  of  chemotherapy  (4  cycles  of  docetaxel  followed  by  4  cycles  of 
5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide  -  FEC).  Subjects  then  underwent  surgery.  After  surgery, 
subjects  received  a  further  10  cycles  of  adjuvant  Ontruzant  or  Herceptin  as  per  randomisation  to 
complete 1 year of therapy. 
All randomised subjects who received at least one infusion of Ontruzant or Herceptin were included in the 
safety set: 437 in the Ontruzant arm and 438 in the Herceptin arm. 
In Ontruzant and Herceptin arms, similar proportion of patients completed the 8 cycles of neoadjuvant 
therapy, surgery, the 10 cycles of adjuvant therapy and completed the study.

Study SB3-G11-NHV (supportive study) 
Double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single-dose study that aimed to demonstrate similarity in PK, 
safety/tolerability  and  immunogenicity  profiles  between  three  presentations  (Ontruzant,  EU  sourced 
Herceptin, and US sourced Herceptin) in healthy male subjects. In each arm, all subjects received a single 
dose (6 mg/kg) of either Ontruzant, EU sourced Herceptin, or US sourced Herceptin by intravenous (IV) 
infusion for 90 minutes (1 single cycle). 
A  total  of  109  healthy  subjects  were  randomised  to  receive  a  single  trastuzumab  infusion,  with  36 
subjects  from  Ontruzant  and  US  Herceptin  treatment  groups  and  37  subjects  from  EU  Herceptin 
treatment group. However, a total of 108 subjects were exposed to IP with 36 subjects in each treatment 
group. One subject withdrew informed consent right before start of infusion after randomisation and was 
replaced by a new subject. This subject was excluded from the Safety set and from the PK population. A 
total  of  108  subjects  (36  subjects  in  each  treatment)  were  included  in  the  safety  set  and  in  the  PK 
population. The safety set comprised all subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug. The 
data cut-off (end of study) was April 24, 2014.

Table 50: Summary of Frequency, Severity and Causality of all TEAEs and the Number of 
Events by PT that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Subjects in Any Treatment Group (Safety Set, Study 
SB3-G11-NHV) 
The majority of TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) to Grade 2 (moderate) in severity, and transient. Two subjects 
(both receiving Ontruzant) experienced Grade 3 (severe) TEAEs; these were 1 event of IRR and 1 event 
of chondropathy reported from each subject. 
The TEAEs seen in the study were as expected for this class of drug and recovered without any sequelae, 
except  for  3  events  following  Ontruzant  treatment  (ankle  fracture,  myalgia,  and  the  SAE  of

chondropathy).  All  of  these  events  were  assessed  by  the  Investigator  not  to  be  related  to  the  IP. 
Moreover,  after  the  data  cut-off,  follow-up  information  was  obtained  per  phone  call  and  an  end-date 
(after the data cut-off) was confirmed for the 3 TEAEs. The SAE of chondropathy recovered with sequelae. 
The proportion of subjects who experienced TEAEs considered to be related to the IPs were 36.1% of the 
subjects after Ontruzant administration, 44.4% of the subjects after EU sourced Herceptin administration 
and 61.1% of the subjects after US sourced Herceptin administration. The most frequently reported TEAE 
suspected to be IP related was IRR (9 in Ontruzant, 8 in EU sourced Herceptin, and 16 in US sourced 
Herceptin). All other TEAEs suspected to be IP related occurred in two or less subjects per treatment 
group. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Based  on  the  Herceptin  safety  profile  to  this  date,  infusion-related  reactions,  CHF  (Congestive  Heart 
Failure), left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pulmonary toxicity are also a recognised AE of special 
interest for Ontruzant. 
The total number of AESI was 113 in the Ontruzant and 98 in the EU Herceptin treatment group. 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
The incidence of common symptoms of infusion-related reactions was balanced across both treatment 
groups: 53 TEAEs associated with infusion-related reaction were reported in 37 (8.5%) patients in the 
Ontruzant treatment group, and 64 events in 44 (10.0%) patients in the EU Herceptin treatment group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  signs  and  symptoms  were  in  the  SOCs  of  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (27 events in 14 [3.2%] patients in the Ontruzant arm, 33 events in 20 
[4.6%] patients in the EU Herceptin arm) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (13 events 
in 11 [2.5%] patients in the Ontruzant arm, 16 events in 13 [3.0%] patients in the EU Herceptin arm). 
The most common symptoms of infusion-related reactions reported in the PT were dyspnoea (10 and 15 
events,  respectively),  chest  discomfort  (9  and  7  events,  respectively),  chills  (7  and  13  events, 
respectively), and pyrexia (4 and 8 events, respectively).  
The majority of infusion-related reactions were Grade 1 (4.1% [18/437] of patients and 4.6% [20/438] 
of  patients  in  the  Ontruzant  and  EU  Herceptin  treatment  groups,  respectively)  and  Grade  2  (4.3% 
[19/437] and 4.6% [20/438] of patients, respectively). In the Ontruzant treatment group, there were no 
severe infusion-related reactions (grade ≥ 3). However, in the Herceptin treatment group, there were 3 
grade 3 infusion-related reactions in 3 (0.7%) subjects, and 1 grade 4 infusion-related reaction reported 
in 1 (0.2%) subject (no grade 5 infusion-related reactions). In both arm, around 30% of the IRR were 
related to IP, and 70% to non-IP. 
Overall, the time pattern was comparable. The incidence of infusion-related reactions was highest during 
the first two treatment cycles for both treatment groups, and the incidence decreased over time in both 
treatment groups. 
Cardiac toxicity 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Assessment 
The baseline cardiac status, as shown by LVEF, was similar in the two treatment groups. At baseline, the 
median  LVEF  value  was  65.0%  in  both  treatment  groups  (range  55%-80%  and  55%-85%  in  the 
Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 82/118 
 
 
 
 
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment group had a significant decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% 
points from baseline and resulting LVEF < 50% (16 [3.7%] patients in the Ontruzant treatment group and 
12 [2.8%] patients in the EU Herceptin treatment group). 
Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction 
In the  Ontruzant treatment group, 14 left ventricular systolic dysfunction events were reported in 11 
(2.5%) patients and, in the EU Herceptin treatment group, 9 left ventricular systolic dysfunction events 
were reported in 8 (1.8%) patients (Final CSR: table 14.3.1-1.1). 
Most  of  them  were  grade  1  or  2  in  both  arms.  In  the  Ontruzant  treatment  group,  13  left  ventricular 
systolic dysfunction events were reported as Grade 1-2 and 1 left ventricular systolic dysfunction event 
was reported as Grade 3. In the Herceptin treatment group, 7 left ventricular systolic dysfunction events 
were reported as Grade 1-2 and 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction events were reported as grade 3; 
there were no Grade 4 or 5 events. 
The majority were related to the IP: 12 IP-related events in the Ontruzant arm and 7 IP-related events in 
the EU Herceptin. There were also 4 non-IP related events in the Ontruzant arm and 1 non-IP related 
events in the Herceptin arm. 
Congestive Heart Failure 
In the Ontruzant treatment group, 2 (0.5%) patients had class II CHF (related to IP) and 1 (0.2%) patient 
had  class  IV  CHF  (not-related  to  IP).  One  event  was  Grade  2,  and  2  were  Grade  3  (Final  CSR:  table 
14.3.1-1.1). 
In the Herceptin arm, 1 (0.2%) patient had class II CHF (Grade 3, non-IP related).  
Overall Cardiac Safety 
Cardiac  TEAEs  at  the  SOC  level  were  cardiac  disorders  (65  events  in  46  [10.5%]  patients  in  the 
Ontruzant,  and  75  events  in  53  [12.1%]  patients  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  groups)  and 
investigations (4 events in 4 [0.9%] patients in the Ontruzant, and 3 events in 3 [0.7%] patients in the 
EU Herceptin treatment groups) (Final CSR: table 14.3.1-1.2). 
The most common reported cardiac TEAEs at the PT level were sinus tachycardia (15 events in 13 [3%] 
patients  in  Ontruzant  arm,  and  21  events  in  20  [4.6%]  patients  in  Herceptin  arm),  Left  ventricular 
dysfunction  (14  events  in  11  [2.5%]  patients  in  the  Ontruzant,  and  9  events  in  8  [1.8%]  patients, 
respectively)  and  tachycardia  (13  events  in  9  [2.1%]  patients,  and  6  events  in  6  [1.4%]  patients, 
respectively).  
These cardiac TEAEs were mainly Grade 1 or 2.  
In each arm, 5 severe cardiac TEAE were reported in 5 (1.1%) patients. All were Grade 3 events with the 
exception of one Grade 5 event of myocardial infraction in the EU Herceptin treatment group. 
In addition, 5 serious cardiac TEAEs were reported: 4 (0.9%) patients reported 4 events in the Ontruzant 
treatment  group  and  1  (0.2%)  patient  reported  1  event  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  group.  In  the 
Ontruzant treatment group, 3 subjects had cardiac failure congestive and 1 subject had supraventricular 
tachycardia. In the Herceptin treatment group, 1 subject had fatal myocardial infarction. 
Pulmonary toxicity  
According to the Herceptin SmPC, severe pulmonary events have been reported with the use of Herceptin 
in the post-marketing setting.

Severe (Grade ≥  3) Pulmonary Events 
The majority of pulmonary events were grade 1 or 2 in severity in the two treatment groups. Ten severe 
(grade ≥  3) TEAEs were reported; 5 (1.1%) subjects reported 6 events in the Ontruzant treatment group 
and 4 (0.9%) subjects reported 4 events in the Herceptin treatment group. 
In the Ontruzant treatment group, 1 event of bronchitis grade 3, 1 event of pleural effusion grade 3 and 
4 events of pneumonia grade 3 (in 3 subjects) were reported. In the Herceptin treatment group, 1 event 
each of pneumonitis grade 5, bronchitis grade 3, bronchopneumonia grade 3 and lobar pneumonia grade 
3 were reported. All events except for the event of grade 5 pneumonitis were resolved without sequelae. 
One event of grade 3 bronchitis (one subject from the Ontruzant treatment group) was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to the investigational product. 
Serious Adverse Events (Pulmonary Events) 
Overall,  9  serious  pulmonary  events  were  reported;  6  events  for  5  (1.1%)  subjects  in  the Ontruzant 
treatment group and 3 events for 3 (0.7%) subjects in the Herceptin treatment group. 
In the Ontruzant treatment group, 1 event of bronchitis and 5 events of pneumonia (in 4 subjects) were 
reported; all events were grade 3 except for 1 event of pneumonia which was grade 2. In the Herceptin

treatment group, 1 event each of pneumonitis, bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia were reported. 
Pneumonitis was grade 5 (fatal) and the other events were grade 3. All events except for the grade 5 
pneumonitis were resolved without sequelae. One serious adverse event of bronchitis grade 3 (1 subject 
from  the  Ontruzant  treatment  group)  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  the 
investigational product. 
Neoadjuvant therapy period 
In the Ontruzant treatment group, 85 TEAEs of special interest were reported in 63 (14.4) patients: 51 
infusion-related reactions in 36 (8.2%) subjects, 5 events of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in 4 
(0.9%) subjects, 2 events of CHF in 2 (0.5%) subjects and 27 pulmonary events in 25 (5.7%) subjects. 
In the Herceptin treatment group, 81 TEAEs of special interest were reported in 59 (13.5%) patients: 64 
infusion-related reactions in 44 (10.0%) subjects, 3 events of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in 3 
(0.7%) subjects, no events of CHF and 14 pulmonary events in 14 (3.2%) patients were reported. 
The profile of the IRR reported in the neoadjuvant therapy period was similar to that of the overall study 
in terms of the most common AEs and respective SOCs (please Cf. overall duration therapy). The most 
frequently reported signs and symptoms were in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site 
conditions  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders.  The  most  common  symptoms  of 
infusion-related reactions reported in the PT were dyspnoea, chest discomfort, chills, and pyrexia. The 
incidence of common symptoms of IRR was balanced across both treatment groups. The majority were 
grade 1 or 2, not-related to IP, but related to non-IP. 
Adjuvant therapy period 
During the adjuvant period, a very low number of TEAEs of special interest were reported (Table 53):  
-  24 in the Ontruzant arm in 20 subjects (4.6%): 2 IRR in 2 (0.5%) subjects (influenza-like illness 
and  pyrexia),  9  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  in  8  (1.8%)  subjects,  1  CHF  in  1  (0.2%) 
subject and 12 pulmonary events in 10 (2.3%) subjects. 
-  17 in the Herceptin arm in 15 subjects (3.4%): no IRR, 6 left ventricular systolic dysfunction in 5 
(1.1%) subjects, 1 CHF in 1 (0.2%) subject and 10 pulmonary events in 9 (2.1%) subjects. 
The majority were grade 1 or 2, and related to IP. 
Study SB3-G11-NHV (supportive study) 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
In the clinical Phase I study, a total of 33 subjects reported 33 events of IRR (9 [25.0%], 8 [22.2%] and 
16 [44.4%] subjects from Ontruzant, EU Herceptin and US Herceptin treatment groups, respectively). 
Among them, 2 subjects had infusion interruptions but completed the infusion. The majority of IRR were 
Grade 1 (n=18) to Grade 2 (n=14). The 1 severe IRR occurred in a subject receiving Ontruzant. Reaction 
onset was 48 minutes after infusion start, with a symptom constellation of back pain, muscle spasms, 
dizziness, fatigue, hyperhidrosis, pallor, headache and pyrexia. The symptoms of IRR were treated with 
paracetamol 500 mg after onset and resolved within 1 day.  
The  most  frequently  reported  symptoms  of  IRR  were  feeling  cold  (21  subjects;  7  in  Ontruzant,  3  in 
EU-Herceptin, and 11 in US-Herceptin), headache (17 subjects; 3 in Ontruzant, 5 in EU-Herceptin, and 9

in US-Herceptin), pyrexia (13 subjects; 4 in Ontruzant, 4 in EU-Herceptin, and 5 in US-Herceptin), and 
chills (13 subjects; 5 in Ontruzant, 3 in EU-Herceptin, and 5 in US-Herceptin). 
Cardiac toxicity 
ECG measures and change from baseline of heart rate, RR interval, PQ interval, PR interval, QRS interval, 
QT interval, QTcF interval and QTcB interval were followed. Mean and median values of all parameters of 
ECG did not show any relevant changes over time. Minor alterations are similar to those usually observed 
in healthy subjects. 
No subject had a QTcF interval > 450 msec at any time point during the study. 
QTcF changes > 60 msec were not observed in any of the subjects. 
Interpretation of ECG recordings showed some abnormalities, but most of these abnormalities did not 
reach clinical relevance as judged by the Investigator. Atrial fibrillation with arrhythmia observed on Day 
3 for one Subject from EU-Herceptin group was assessed by the Investigator as a clinically significant 
abnormality; on Day 4 and all subsequent assessments, the ECG recordings for this subject was normal.

Neoadjuvant therapy period 
During the neoadjuvant therapy period, 81 SAEs were reported in 46 (10.5%) Ontruzant subjects, and 64 
events in 47 (10.7%) Herceptin subjects, respectively.  
The most frequently occurring SAEs at the PT level were febrile neutropenia (11 events in 10 [2.3%] 
subjects in the Ontruzant arm, and 14 events in 13 [3%] subjects in the Herceptin arm), neutrophil count 
decreased (20 events in 8 [1.8%] subjects, and 7 events in 4 [0.9%] subjects, respectively), neutropenia 
(7 events in 7 [1.6%] subjects, and 5 events in 5 [1.1%] subjects, respectively) and diarrhoea (5 events 
in 3 [0.7%] subjects and 3 events in 3 [0.7%] subjects, respectively). 
Most of the SAE were grade 3 or 4 in severity, and most of the patients had grade 3 or 4 SAEs: 41 grade 
3 SAE in 21 patients in Ontruzant arm and 31 grade 3 SAE in 22 patients in Herceptin arm; 30 grade 4 SAE 
in 18 patients and 20 grade 4 SAE in 15 patients, respectively. Finally, the number of SAE related to IP 
was equivalent in both arm (2.1% of the subjects), and the number of SAEs related to non-IP was similar 
in both arms (8.2% versus 7.8%, respectively). Most of them recovered/resolved without sequelae (80 
SAE in Ontruzant arm and 61 events in Herceptin arm). 
Adjuvant therapy period 
Table  55:  Serious  TEAE  grade,  relationship  to  IP  and  non-IP,  and  outcome  during  the 
adjuvant Period – Safety set 
The SOC with the most SAE were infections and infestations (6 SAE in 6 patients – 1.4% in Ontruzant, and 
7 SAE in 6 patients – 1.4%), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (3 SAE in 3 patients – 0.7% 
in Ontruzant, and 4 SAE in 4 patients – 0.9%), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2 SAE 
in 2 patients – 0.5% in each arm). The most frequently occurring SAE at the PT level was pneumonia (2 
[0.5%] subjects in the Ontruzant treatment group and no subject in the Herceptin treatment group); the 
remaining SAEs were reported for one subject each in one of the 2 treatment groups. 
Study SB3-G11-NHV (supportive study) 
No deaths occurred during the study period.  
One SAE was reported in 1 subject in the Ontruzant treatment group, as follows: chondropathy. The event 
of chondropathy was assessed by the Investigator to be of Grade 3 severity with outcome ‘recovered with 
sequelae and not related to the IP.

Haematology 
The pattern of laboratory abnormalities of haematology parameters (haemoglobin, absolute neutrophil 
count, platelet count and white blood cell count) observed was similar between the Ontruzant and EU 
Herceptin treatment groups during the overall study period (Table 62).

In both arms, other commonly (incidence > 5% in either treatment group) reported haematology-related 
TEAEs were: 
- Leukopenia (259 events were reported in 125 [28.6%] patients in Ontruzant, and 238 events in 114 
[26%] patients in Herceptin). 
- Anaemia (183 events were reported in 96 [22%] patients in Ontruzant, and 198 events in 95 [21.7%]

Urinalysis 
The collection of urinalysis results included urine haemoglobin, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, specific 
gravity, bilirubin, glucose, protein, and urobilinogen at three different time points: baseline, cycle 5, and 
pre-surgery.  
All parameters were mostly normal at baseline in both treatment groups (range from 81.1% to 99.0% 
and  from  78.1%  to  98.7%  in  the  Ontruzant  and  EU  Herceptin  group,  respectively),  and  the  baseline 
results were not significantly changed at cycle 5 and presurgery. 
Overall, there was no significant difference in urinalysis results between the treatment groups.

Haematology, Biochemistry, Urinalysis, and Cardiac markers parameters  
Mean and median values of all parameters did not show any significant change over time. A few subjects 
had shifts from normal values at baseline to values outside the normal range. However, there were no 
significant changes from baseline in the values in any treatment group.

Immunological events 
Study SB3-G31-BC 
In  the  clinical  Phase  III  study,  the  immunogenicity  profile  was  evaluated  as  one  of  the  secondary 
endpoints in terms of the incidence of ADA and NAbs. Blood samples for determination of immunogenicity 
were collected at pre-dose of Cycle 1, 5, 9, 14 and 30 days after the last dose of IP.

Titre evolution by visit for each ADA positive patient 
Overall ADA results, up to the relevant timepoint, were defined as positive when patients with a negative 
ADA at pre-dose Cycle 1 had at least one positive result after the dose at Cycle 1, and when patients with 
a positive ADA at pre-dose Cycle 1 had at least one positive result after the dose at Cycle 1 with a higher 
titre level compared with baseline (Cycle 1). 
In  the  final  CSR,  the  number  of  patients  with  an  overall  ADA  positive  result  was  3  (0.7%)  in  both 
Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups. In terms of neutralising antibody (NAb), 2 out of 3 ADA 
positive patients in each treatment group has also detectable NAb. 
ADA impact on clinical outcome 
In the Ontruzant treatment group, 3 patients had ADA-positive results, with PK data available for one 
patient. 
In the EU Herceptin treatment group, 3 patients had overall ADA-positive results, with no PK information 
available. 
Clinical relevance of TEAE 
During the overall study period, for the 3 subjects with an overall positive ADA result in each arm, a total 
of 23 TEAE were reported in Ontruzant and 25 TEAE in Herceptin (

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study SB3-G31-BC 
Adverse events leading to IP or non-IP discontinuation 
Overall period 
During  the  overall  study  period,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  affecting  IP  or  non-IP  discontinuation  was 
comparable between the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment group. A summary of TEAEs affecting IP or 
non-IP administration is presented in Table 67. 
Table  61:  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  Affecting  IP  or  non-IP  Administration  during  the 
Overall Study Period– Safety set (SB3-G31-BC) 
The most common reasons by SOC for IP discontinuation in the 2 arms were events in cardiac disorders: 
12  events  in  11  (2.5%)  patients  in  Ontruzant  vs.  6  events  in  6  (1.4%)  patients  in  Herceptin.  In  the 
Ontruzant  treatment  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  at  the  PT  level  were  left  ventricular 
dysfunction  (9  events  in  8  subjects)  and  cardiac  failure  congestive  (2  events  in  2  subjects).  In  the 
Herceptin treatment group, the most frequently reported TEAE reported was left ventricular dysfunction 
(5 events in 5 subjects). TEAEs leading to non-IP (docetaxel) discontinuation were reported in 4 subjects 
(0.9%) in the Herceptin treatment group (no subject in the Ontruzant treatment group). The 3 TEAEs 
leading to non-IP discontinuation were infusion-related reaction (2 events), peripheral motor neuropathy 
(1 event) and ALT increased (1 event). 
TEAEs  leading  to  non-IP  (FEC)  discontinuation  were  reported  in  6  subjects  (1.4%)  in  the  Ontruzant 
treatment group (9 events) and 4 subjects (0.9%) in the Herceptin treatment group (4 events). In the 
Ontruzant arm, the 9 TEAEs leading to non-IP discontinuation were: febrile neutropenia, cardia failure 
congestive, diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, cellulitis, WBC decreased, suicide, and renal failure acute. In the 
Herceptin arm, they were: neutropenia, fatigue, myalgia and hypotension. 
Neoadjuvant therapy period 
The  pattern  of  events  that  led  to  affecting  IP  or  non-IP  discontinuation  was  comparable  between  the 
Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment groups during the neoadjuvant therapy period (

Table 62: Summary of Adverse Events Affecting IP or non-IP Administration during the 
neoadjuvant Period– Safety set (SB3-G31-BC) 
TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation were reported in 4 subjects (0.9%) in the Ontruzant treatment group 
(7 events) and 7 subjects (1.6%) in the Herceptin treatment group (7 events). As seen in the overall 
therapy period, cardiotoxicity TEAE were also the most common reasons  for IP discontinuation in the 
neoadjuvant  period.  In  the  Ontruzant  treatment  group,  the  cardiotoxicity  TEAEs  leading  to  IP 
discontinuation  were  left  ventricular  dysfunction  (2  events),  cardiac  failure  congestive  (1)  and 
supraventricular tachycardia (1). In the Herceptin treatment group, the cardiotoxicity TEAEs were left 
ventricular dysfunction (2). 
TEAEs leading to non-IP discontinuation were reported in 6 (1.4%) subjects in the Ontruzant treatment 
group and 8 (1.8%) subjects in the Herceptin treatment group. 
Adjuvant therapy period 
The pattern of events that led to IP discontinuation was comparable between the Ontruzant and Herceptin 
treatment groups during the adjuvant therapy period (Table 69).  
Table  63:  Summary  of  Adverse  Events  Affecting  IP  Administration  during  the  adjuvant 
Period– Safety set (SB3-G31-BC) 
As noticed in the overall and neoadjuvant therapy period, cardiotoxicity TEAE were also the most common 
reasons for IP discontinuation in the neoadjuvant and the adjuvant period. In the Ontruzant treatment 
group, the cardiotoxicity TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation were left ventricular dysfunction (7 events) 
and cardiac failure congestive (1). In the Herceptin treatment group, the cardiotoxicity TEAEs were left 
ventricular dysfunction (3) and cardiac failure congestive (1).

Adverse events leading to IP dose delay/interruption 
Overall period 
The  pattern  of  events  that  led  to  IP  delay/interruption  was  comparable  between  the  Ontruzant  and 
Herceptin treatment groups. 
During the overall period, TEAEs leading to IP dose delay were reported in 127 subjects (29.1%) in the 
Ontruzant treatment group (225 events) and 128 subjects (29.2%) in the Herceptin treatment group 
(226 events). The most common reasons by SOC for IP dose delay in the 2 treatment groups were events 
in blood and lymphatic system disorders (102 events in 69 patients (15.8%) in Ontruzant and 112 events 
in 71 patients (16.2%) in Herceptin), mainly due to the number of neutropenia (91 events in 65 patients 
(14.9%) in Ontruzant and 95 events in 68 patients (15.5%) in Herceptin) and investigations. 
TEAEs leading to IP dose interruption at the PT level were reported in 9 subjects (2.1%) in the Ontruzant 
treatment group (9 events) and 12 subjects (2.7%) in the Herceptin treatment group (16 events). The 
most common reasons for IP dose interruption in the 2 treatment groups were infusion-related reactions: 
9 events in 9 [2.1%] subjects in Ontruzant, 12 events in 10 [2.3%] subjects in Herceptin. 
Neoadjuvant therapy period 
The  pattern  of  events  that  led  to  IP  delay/interruption  was  comparable  between  the  Ontruzant  and 
Herceptin treatment groups (
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 101/118 
 
 
 
 
Table 68). Moreover, similar profiles were observed during overall and neoadjuvant period for both arms.  
Adjuvant therapy period 
During the adjuvant therapy period, TEAEs leading to IP dose delay were reported in 29 subjects (6.6%) 
in the Ontruzant treatment group (39 events) and in 20 subjects (4.6%) in the Herceptin treatment group 
(22 events) (Table 69). 
A  slight  numerical  higher  patients  with  TEAEs  leading  to  IP  dose  delay  were  noted  in  the  Ontruzant 
treatment  groups  with  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (8  events  in  Ontruzant  and  1  event  in 
Herceptin), gastrointestinal disorders (4 versus none, respectively), and investigations (4 versus none, 
respectively) of PT terms, whereas higher number of patients with TEAEs leading to IP dose delay were 
observed in the Herceptin treatment groups with cardiac disorders (1 versus 3, respectively) of PT terms. 
Although slight difference exists in IP dose delay between the two treatment groups, dose intensity and 
relative  dose  intensity  of  adjuvant  IP  (investigational  product)  are  comparable  between  the  two 
treatment  groups.  Therefore,  slightly  different  number  of  TEAE  leading  to  IP  dose  delay  during  the 
adjuvant period is not considered clinically relevant. 
Only  1  subject  had  an  IP  dose  interruption  in  the  Ontruzant  arm  due  to  infusion  related  reaction  (no 
subject in the Herceptin arm). 
Adverse events leading to non-IP dose delay/modification/interruption 
Overall period 
The pattern of events that led to non-IP delay/modification/interruption was comparable between the 
Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment groups (Table 67). 
TEAEs leading to non-IP (docetaxel) dose delay/modification were reported in 57 subjects (13.0%) in the 
Ontruzant treatment group (94 events) and 53 subjects (12.1%) in the Herceptin treatment group (69 
events). The most common reasons by SOC in the 2 treatment groups were events in blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (29 events in Ontruzant and 23 events in Herceptin) and investigations (34 events in 
Ontruzant and 16 events in Herceptin). In the Ontruzant treatment group, the most frequently reported 
TEAEs at the PT level were ALT increased (20 [4.6%] subjects), febrile neutropenia (16 [3.7%] subjects) 
and  neutropenia  (8  [1.8%]  subjects).  In  the  Herceptin  treatment  group,  the  TEAEs  were  febrile 
neutropenia  (17  [3.9%]  subjects),  ALT  increased  (8  [1.8%]  subjects)  and  neutropenia  (5  [1.1%] 
subjects). 
TEAEs leading to non-IP (FEC) dose delay/modification were  reported in 105 subjects (24.0%) in the 
Ontruzant treatment group (171 events) and 110 subjects (25.1%) in the Herceptin treatment group 
(187 events). The most common reasons by SOC in the 2 treatment groups were events in blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (98 events in Ontruzant and 110 events in Herceptin) and investigations (27 
events in Ontruzant and 28 events in Herceptin). In the Ontruzant treatment group, the most frequently 
reported TEAEs at the PT level were neutropenia (64 [14.6%] subjects) and ALT increased and neutrophil 
count decreased (7 [1.6%] subjects). In the Herceptin treatment group, the TEAEs were neutropenia (67 
[15.3%] subjects), leukopenia (11 [2.5%] subjects) and ALT increased (10 [2.3%] subjects) (Final CSR 
– table 14.3.1-1.15). 
TEAEs  leading  to  non-IP  (docetaxel)  dose  interruption  were  reported  in  18  subjects  (4.1%)  in  the 
Ontruzant treatment group (23 events) and 28 subjects (6.4%) in the Herceptin treatment group (36 
events). In the Ontruzant treatment group, the TEAEs at the PT level were infusion-related reaction (17

[3.9%] subjects) and extravasation (1 [0.2%] subject). In the Herceptin treatment group, the TEAEs 
were infusion-related reaction (28 [6.4%] subjects) and myalgia (1 [0.2%] subject) (Final CSR: table 
14.3.1-1.16). 
FEC dose interruption was less common event than docetaxel dose interruption: none in the Ontruzant 
arm, and 2 subjects (0.5%) in the Herceptin arm (2 events: 1 neutropenia and 1 infusion related reaction) 
(Final CSR: table 14.3.1-1.16). 
Neoadjuvant therapy period 
Similarly to the overall period, during the neoadjuvant therapy period, the pattern of events that led to 
non-IP delay/modification/interruption was comparable between the Ontruzant and Herceptin treatment 
groups (
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

Table 68). 
TEAEs leading to non-IP (docetaxel) dose delay/modification were reported in 57 subjects (13.0%) in the 
Ontruzant treatment group (94 events) and 52 subjects (11.9%) in the Herceptin treatment group (68 
events) (Final CSR: table 14.3.1-2.15). 
TEAEs leading to non-IP (FEC) dose delay/modification were  reported in 105 subjects (24.0%) in the 
Ontruzant treatment group (171 events) and 109 subjects (24.9%) in the Herceptin treatment group 
(186 events) (Final CSR: table 14.3.1-2.15). 
TEAEs  leading  to  non-IP  (docetaxel)  dose  interruption  were  reported  in  18  subjects  (4.1%)  in  the 
Ontruzant treatment group (23 events) and 28 subjects (6.4%) in the Herceptin treatment group (36 
events) (Final CSR: table 14.3.1-2.16). 
FEC dose interruption was less common event than docetaxel dose interruption: none in the Ontruzant 
arm, and 2 subjects (0.5%) in the Herceptin arm (2 events: 1 neutropenia and 1 infusion related reaction) 
(Final CSR: table 14.3.1-2.16). 
Study SB3-G11-NHV (supportive study) 
No subjects were discontinued from the study due to AEs. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trastuzumab  has  been  widely  used  in  clinical  practice  with  a  well-characterised  safety  profile  from 
published clinical studies and a large amount of post-marketing safety data. As Ontruzant is a proposed 
biosimilar to Herceptin, the safety/tolerability of trastuzumab from Ontruzant has been compared against 
the safety/tolerability profile of Herceptin to show similarity. Key safety information was derived from the 
clinical Phase III study (SB3-G31-BC) in EBC or LABC patients, supported by the clinical Phase I study 
(SB3-G11-NHV) in healthy subjects. 
In study SB3-G31-BC, the median duration of safety observation was 437 days (range 94–593 days) in 
the Ontruzant treatment group and 438 days (range 24–651 days) in the Herceptin treatment group. 
Slightly less patients withdraw before surgery in the Ontruzant arm compared to Herceptin (4.1% and 
5%,  respectively),  and  slightly  more  patients  withdraw  during  adjuvant  therapy  (8.7%  and  7.3%, 
respectively). This last difference was mainly due to more adverse events (2.5% and 1.1%, respectively). 
IP  exposure  was  comparable  between  the  2  arms  with  similar:  exposure  duration  (during  the 
neoadjuvant,  adjuvant  and  overall  therapy  period),  dose  intensity  of  IP  (during  the  neoadjuvant, 
adjuvant and overall therapy period), cumulative dose of IP, cycle delay of IP, dose interruption of IP, and 
relative dose intensity (during the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and overall therapy period) ( 
Table 44). A similar number of cycles was completed in each arm, with a similar number of subjects who 
completed each cycle 
The non-IP exposure was also similar between the 2 arms: similar dose intensity, relative dose intensity, 
exposure duration and cumulative dose of docetaxel from cycle 1 to cycle 4, and of FEC regimen from 
cycle 5 to cycle 8. 
In terms of adverse events in the overall study period, although the number of reported TEAEs was higher 
in Ontruzant group (5433) compared to Herceptin group (5245), the number of patients reporting a TEAE 
of any grade at any point during the study was comparable: 426 (97.5%) and 421 (96.1%) patients in the 
Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups, respectively. The numerical difference of 188 TEAE was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 104/118 
 
 
 
 
derived from the large variation in the number of AEs reported in each patient; a small number of patients 
reported a relatively high number of AEs, up to 65 events, and the same AEs were reported repeatedly in 
the same patients. 
Most of the patients had grade 3 or 4 TEAE in both groups. The incidence of severe (Grade ≥ 3) TEAEs 
during overall study period was comparable between the two treatment groups: 860 TEAE in 325 (74.4%) 
patients in Ontruzant and 842 TEAE in 315 (71.9%) patients in EU Herceptin. However, most of the TEAE 
were Grade 1 or 2 in both groups: 2844 grade 1 TEAE and 1729 grade 2 TEAE in Ontruzant, and 2805 
grade 1 TEAE and 1598 grade 2 TEAE in Herceptin. In both treatment groups, most of the TEAEs were 
recovered/resolved without sequelae, and patients had TEAE mostly unrelated to IP (average of 63.5% of 
the TEAE), but related to non-IP (average of 92.5% of the TEAE). 
The most common adverse events with Ontruzant, including alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, leukopenia 
and anaemia, were in line with those of Herceptin in pivotal clinical studies and in the post-marketing 
setting.  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  was  alopecia  (68.4%  in  Ontruzant  and  64.6%  in  EU 
Herceptin),  known  to  be  associated  with  using  docetaxel.  Although  slightly  higher  in  Ontruzant,  the 
incidence  of  the  most  of  the  common  TEAE  was,  overall,  comparable  with  less  than  5%  difference 
between the 2 treatment groups. Diarrhoea was the event which differed by more than 5% between the 
two treatment groups (21.1% of patients in Ontruzant and 15.3% of patients in EU Herceptin treatment 
group), however the number of patients with severe diarrhoea was the same, 6 in each treatment group.  
In  terms  of  serious  adverse  events,  although  the  number  of  reported  serious  TEAEs  was  higher  in 
Ontruzant group (98) compared to Herceptin group (79), the number of patients reporting a serious TEAE 
during the study was comparable: 56 (12.8%) patients for Ontruzant and 58 (13.2%) patients for EU 
Herceptin. The numerical difference of 19 in the incidence of SAEs was derived from a small number of 
patients who reported up to 12 SAEs. In both treatment groups, most of the patients had Grade 3 or 4 
SAEs.  The  SAEs  were,  for  the  majority,  unrelated  to  IP  (average  of  10.75%)  but  related  to  non-IP 
(average of 8.15%). Most of them recovered/resolved without sequelae. 
The most frequently occurring severe TEAEs were neutropenia (57.0% in the Ontruzant treatment group 
and 55.3% in the Herceptin treatment group), leukopenia (17.6% and 14.2%, respectively), neutrophil 
count decreased (11.2% and 10.3%, respectively), febrile neutropenia (6.4% and 7.8%, respectively) 
and ALT increased (3.2% and 2.5%, respectively). While the frequency of neutropenia and leukopenia 
was slightly higher in the Ontruzant group, it was not considered significant. 
6 deaths were reported (one was in the Ontruzant arm and 5 in the Herceptin arm); none were considered 
to be related to the IP.  
Incidences  of  TEAEs  of  special  interest  (infusion-related  reaction,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction and pulmonary toxicity) were also comparable between Ontruzant and the 
EU Herceptin treatment groups. 
The incidence of common symptoms of infusion-related reactions was balanced across both treatment 
groups. Overall, the time pattern was comparable. The incidence of infusion-related reactions was highest 
during the first two treatment cycles for both treatment groups, and the incidence decreased over time in 
both treatment groups. 
Cardiac toxicity is the most concerning adverse effect of trastuzumab usually characterised as cumulative 
toxicity and manifesting as an asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) rather than 
symptomatic  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF).  The  overall  incidence  of  cardiac  toxicity  was  comparable 
between  treatment  arms  and  comparable  to  that  reported  for  trastuzumab  combination  with 
anthracyclines. There was also no indication of any clinically relevant differences between Ontruzant and 
the  reference  product.  A  phase  III  Long-term  Follow-up  Study  for  Cardiac  Safety  SB3-G31-BC-E  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 105/118 
 
 
 
 
initiated by the applicant prior to the submission of the MAA. The purpose of this study is to observe the 
incidence of symptomatic CHF NYHA class II, III, and IV and asymptomatic significant LVEF decrease in 
patients who participated in the SB3-G31-BC study and treated with Ontruzant (proposed trastuzumab 
biosimilar) or Herceptin as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. An additional objective of this study will 
be  to observe  the long  term  effectiveness  of  Ontruzant  compared  to  Herceptin  (see  discussion  in  the 
efficacy part). 
Although there were numerically more pulmonary events in the Ontruzant treatment group (35 patients) 
[8%] vs 23 patients [5.3%]), the proportion of patients with severe (Grade ≥  3) pulmonary TEAEs were 
similar in two treatment groups (5 (1.1%) patients in Ontruzant and 4 (0.9%) patients in EU Herceptin 
treatment group). 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  affecting  IP  or  non-IP  administration  was  comparable  between  the  2 
treatment groups: 15 (3.4%) and 14 (3.2%) patients reported IP discontinuation; 127 (29.1%) and 128 
(29.2%) patients reported IP dose delay; 9 (2.1%) and 12 (2.7%) patients reported IP dose interruption 
in Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups; and 6 (1.4%) and 8 (1.8%) patients reported non-IP 
discontinuation respectively. 
In summary, the incidence, severity and outcome of reported TEAEs (including SAEs and TEAEs of special 
interest) were generally comparable between the Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups in the 
adjuvant, the neoadjuvant and the overall study periods. All the AEs reported during study were within 
the expected ranges for this population and treatment, and no new or unexpected safety findings were 
observed. 
With regards to immunogenicity, the incidence of ADA to trastuzumab was similar in Ontruzant and EU 
Herceptin treatment groups at each timepoint (low immunogenicity) (Table 65) for up to 1 year. Antidrug 
antibodies against trastuzumab have been observed transiently during the study in <1% of patients and 
in very low titres. Although interpretation are limited due to the low incidence of positive ADA results, no 
significant clinical impact of ADA-positive results were found in terms of efficacy, PK, and safety profiles 
in both treatment groups. 
With regards to the supportive study (Study SB3-G11-NHV) in healthy volunteers, although its value for 
comparability exercise is limited from safety point of view given single dose administered, small sample 
size and healthy volunteers enrolled, safety/tolerability and immunogenicity between the 3 presentations 
(Ontruzant, EU Herceptin, and US Herceptin) was comparable. 
There were no significant changes from baseline in the values in any treatment group for haematology, 
biochemistry, urinalysis and cardiac markers parameters. 
There have been no exposures during pregnancy in the SB3 Phase III study. Oligohydramnios is a 
complication in approximately 4.5% of all pregnancies and severe oligohydramnios is a complication in 
0.7% of pregnancies. Similarly to Herceptin, Ontruzant should be avoided during pregnancy unless the 
potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Section 4.6 of the SmPC warns 
about the risk of oligohydramnios and foetal harm. 
From the safety database of trastuzumab all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and 
post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics of Ontruzant which follows 
the one of Herceptin. Furthermore, the RMP of Ontruzant adequately addresses the safety concerns of 
trastuzumab, in line with Herceptin. 
The applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications for the biosimilar Ontruzant as granted for 
Herceptin for intravenous administration in the EU. Ontruzant showed similarity to Herceptin in terms of 
safety based on available data up to 52 weeks in in EBC or LABC patients. The results are comparable to 
data published for the reference product. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 106/118 
 
 
 
 
between Ontruzant and Herceptin in key trastuzumab adverse events that would preclude extrapolation 
of safety outcomes obtained in the HER2-positive MBC and MGC indication. Furthermore, the mechanism 
of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and results of the physico-chemical, 
structural, and biological characterization studies, as well as PK data support similarity between 
Ontruzant and Herceptin. Therefore, extrapolation from safety perspective is considered acceptable. 
Considering Herceptin is also marketed for subcutaneous administration and the Applicant applied only 
for intravenous administration, a risk of medication error was identified. Adequate risk minimisation 
measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in the RMP. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The main data relevant for comparability exercise in terms of safety comes from the completed 1-year 
study SB3-G31-BC on women with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) or LABC. The overall safety 
profile as reflected by the most frequently reported TEAEs, severity of the TEAEs and number reported as 
related, appears broadly similar between Ontruzant and Herceptin and in line with those expected on the 
basis of the EU Herceptin SmPC. The immunogenicity profiles were also comparable in terms of overall 
ADA incidences and neutralising antibodies between the Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups.  
To conclude, the available safety data support biosimilarity between Ontruzant and Herceptin and since 
no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  safety  were  observed  in  EBC  and  LABC  between  Ontruzant  and 
Herceptin, no differences in the safety of Ontruzant is expected in the MBC and MGC indication and hence, 
extrapolation to other indications of the reference product is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ontruzant is developed as a biosimilar to Herceptin. The approval is sought for intravenous use in all 
approved indications of the reference product: treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic 
breast cancer, early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. 
3.1.2.  Main studies 
From  the  quality  perspective,  a  comprehensive  similarity  study  has  been  performed  to  assess  the 
biosimilar  comparability  of  Ontruzant  with  Herceptin,  including  characterisation  of  structural, 
physicochemical and biological properties of Ontruzant clinical material and PVR batches, in side-by-side 
assays with the EU Herceptin (Reference Product).  
The  non-clinical  comparability  programme  consisted  in  a  series  of  in  vitro  PD  studies  assessing  the 
biological  activity  of  Ontruzant  compared  to  EU  or  US  Herceptin  using  various  cell-based  and  binding 
assays. An in vivo study assessing the therapeutic efficacy of Ontruzant compared to EU Herceptin and US 
Herceptin in the orthotopic BT-474 human breast cancer cell xenograft mouse model was also submitted 
as supportive information. 
The  clinical  trial  programme  conducted  to  assess  biosimilarity  between  Ontruzant  and  Herceptin  was 
based on two trials: 
• 
• 
Study SB3-G11-NHV, Phase I PK study in male healthy volunteers. 
Study SB3-G31-BC, Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of Ontruzant and Herceptin 
in women with newly diagnosed HER2 positive early or locally advanced breast cancer. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From a quality perspective, it is considered that similarity between Ontruzant and EU Herceptin was 
shown by characterisation of structural, physicochemical and biological properties in side-by-side assays. 
Results from primary, secondary and tertiary structures of the trastuzumab molecule showed that these 
were comparable. Minor differences were observed (slightly lower levels of N-terminal pyroglutamate, 
slightly higher C-terminal lysine and C-terminal α-amidated Pro content in Ontruzant batches which are 
not expected to impact safety/ efficacy and minor differences in methionine oxidation and deamidation 
profiles which did not impact biological activity). In addition, biosimilarity also encompassed evaluation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 112/118 
 
 
 
 
the glycosylation profile (only minor differences in the relative content of N-glycans; degradation profile; 
charge variants, HER2 binding and anti-proliferation activity; ADCC activity; binding affinity to Fc 
receptors (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn) and the complement component C1q 
(genotype for FcγRIIIa requested); additional biological assays (HER2 ECD shedding, surface HER2 
expression, inhibition of AKT, angiogenesis, combination with chemotherapy and CDC assay). 
From a non-clinical perspective, the in vitro assays performed on an appropriate number of batches have 
shown similarity between Ontruzant and the EU Herceptin reference product in terms of HER2 binding, 
inhibition of proliferation, ADCC, ADCP, C1q binding, Fc receptor binding. HER2 expression level, HER2 
ECD shedding, inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. In vitro angiogenesis and combination treatment with 
chemotherapy completed the in vitro similarity assessment.  
From  a  pharmacokinetics  perspective,  comparability  between  Ontruzant  and  Herceptin  has  been 
demonstrated in study SB3-G11-NHV since the ratios (90% CI) of geometric means for both primary PK 
endpoints AUC0-last and Cmax were within the acceptability range of 80-125%. In study SB3-G31-BC, a 
statistical comparison for the Ctrough concentrations pre-dose of Cycle 8 support similarity for the Ctrough 
concentrations between treatments. The minimum target concentration of 20 µg/ml was reached at cycle 
3 for both products and steady state appeared to be reached at Cycle 7. 
Based on the efficacy results of the phase III study in patients with HER2 positive EBC/LABC, Ontruzant 
was concluded to be equivalent to Herceptin. Results for other efficacy endpoints (EFS and OS) are still 
immature but do not suggest significant differences at one year time point. Although the difference in 
bpCR was slightly outside the pre-specified equivalence range in the upper bound limit, this observation 
was  considered  at  least  in  part  confounded  by  a  small  shift  in  ADCC  activity  in  a  number  of  the  EU 
Herceptin batches used in the pivotal trial. Overall it is doubtful that a small shift as the one observed 
would have any significant impact in terms of clinical outcomes although numerically it is thought to have 
contributed to a more extreme location of the point estimate and upper bound of the confidence interval, 
shifting  the  latter  beyond  the  pre-specified  equivalence  margin.    Based  on  additional  analysis  and 
considering the evidence of similarity provided in terms of quality, non-clinical, PK, clinical efficacy and 
safety,  biosimilarity  has  been  sufficiently  shown  for  Ontruzant  compared  to  the  reference  product 
Herceptin. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The exact magnitude of the effect of the observed ADCC shift for Herceptin on bpCR and clinical important 
endpoints is not known but the effect is likely to be small and not of clinical relevance. In view of the 
totality of the data, this remaining uncertainty does not question the biosimilarity between Ontruzant and 
Herceptin. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data were provided from the clinical studies in healthy volunteers and women with HER2-positive 
early breast cancer (EBC) or LABC (randomised phase III study SB3-G31-BC).  
The main data for comparability exercise in terms of safety comes from the study SB3-G31-BC (1-year 
data). The overall incidences of TEAEs and their severity were generally comparable between the test and 
the reference product and in line with those expected on the basis of the Herceptin SmPC. 
The most frequently reported ADRs corresponded to blood and lymphatic system disorders (76.0% in the 
Ontruzant and 71.9% in the Herceptin treatment groups), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (73.9% 
and 70.8%, respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders (48.3% and 46.8%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018  
Page 113/118 
 
 
 
 
The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  were  alopecia,  neutropenia,  nausea,  leukopenia,  anaemia  (and 
diarrhoea, with comparable incidence and severity observed. 
Incidences  of  TEAEs  of  special  interest  (infusion-related  reactions,  CHF,  left  ventricular  systolic 
dysfunction) were comparable between the Ontruzant and EU Herceptin treatment groups. Pulmonary 
toxicity which is considered also as AESI was comparable in both groups. 
No increased immunogenicity has been observed with Ontruzant compared with EU Herceptin. The overall 
incidence of ADA to trastuzumab up to end of study was low in both treatment groups (3 [0.7%] subjects 
in each group). 
In conclusion, there were no clinically meaningful differences in safety profiles between the Ontruzant 
treatment group and EU Herceptin treatment groups in EBC or LABC patients up to data cut-off date (Feb 
14, 2017). Furthermore, other than safety issues identified from the use of Herceptin, no additional safety 
issues were identified during the study period.  
There is no indication from the observed safety profile that efficacy finding in terms of apparent higher 
bpCR rates in the Ontruzant arm are associated with worsening of the safety profile up to one year of 
observation.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties regarding the comparability of the clinical safety of Ontruzant with 
Herceptin. While there was also no indication of any clinically relevant differences between Ontruzant and 
the reference product in terms of cardiac toxicity, a Phase III long-term follow-up study initiated by the 
Applicant (SB3-G31-BC-E) is currently ongoing and will provide relevant safety information on cardiac 
dysfunction (see RMP). 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
From a quality and non-clinical perspective, in vitro and in vivo functional assays such as HER 2 binding, 
inhibition  of  proliferation,  ADCC,  ADCP,  C1q  binding  and  Fc  receptor  binding  have  demonstrated  that 
Ontruzant is similar to Herceptin.  
Similarity of Ontruzant and Herceptin was also shown from a PK perspective. PD, with the exception those 
provided with exploratory analyses for the potential impact of the ADCC quality shift, data have not been 
provided and this is justified by the absence of validated biomarkers.  
Ontruzant can be considered similar in terms of efficacy to the reference product Herceptin.  
The descriptive comparison of safety, immunogenicity, efficacy (EFS and OS), and tolerability profile of 
Ontruzant  and  Herceptin  given  in  combination  with  a  taxane  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  relevant 
differences between both treatments up to 1 year.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Biosimilarity of Ontruzant to Herceptin has been shown based on the provided quality, non-clinical and 
clinical comparability data from study SB3-G31-BC comparing the efficacy and safety of Ontruzant and 
Assessment report

Herceptin conducted in women with newly diagnosed HER2 positive early or locally advanced breast 
cancer.  
Ontruzant  was  also  shown  similar  to  Herceptin  in  terms  of  safety  based  on  available  data  from 
SB3-G31-BC up to 24 weeks. The results are comparable to data published for the reference product. 
While some differences in terms of clinical safety have been reported between indications, these are likely 
to  be  the  result  of  the  use  of  concomitant  medication  and  other  factors  aforementioned  rather  than 
differences related to trastuzumab.  
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Herceptin is authorised in patients with HER2-positive MBC, early breast cancer, and metastatic gastric 
cancer.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  trastuzumab  is  the  same  in  all  three  indications  and  the  target 
receptor involved is also the same in early breast cancer, metastatic gastric cancer and MBC (i.e., HER2). 
The dosage is also similar for all 3 indications, and trastuzumab is administered by the same route in all 
indications. Hence, extrapolation in terms of efficacy is supported by the results of the physico-chemical, 
structural  and  biological  characterization  data,  results  from  comparative  preclinical  studies  (in  vitro 
functional tests) together with PK comparability data. Extrapolation is also considered acceptable from 
safety  perspective  since  no  difference  in  the  safety  risks  have  been  identified.  Overall,  available  data 
support the extrapolation to the other indications of the reference product. 
The applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications for the biosimilar Ontruzant as granted for 
Herceptin for intravenous administration in the EU. Considering Herceptin is also marketed for 
subcutaneous administration, a risk of medication error was identified. Adequate risk minimisation 
measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been included in the RMP. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
Ontruzant is considered biosimilar to Herceptin and therefore the overall benefit risk balance of Ontruzant 
is positive in the following indications: 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer: 
(MBC): 
- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. 
- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease. 
- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/9855/2018

Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). 
- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see 
section 5.1). 
- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal 
junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have 
HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ 
result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

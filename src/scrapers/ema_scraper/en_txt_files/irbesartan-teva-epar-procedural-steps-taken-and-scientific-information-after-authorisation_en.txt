The European Commission triggered a referral under 
12/11/2020 
19/02/2021 
Annex II 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Irbesartan Teva EMEA/H/A-31/1471/C/1093/0032 
Page 4/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commission Decision was issued on 11 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP’s opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

For further information please refer to the Renin-
evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS 
blockade therapy and given the seriousness of the 
identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines 
Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit-
risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine 
whether any regulatory measures should be taken on 
the marketing authorisations of the products 
involved in this procedure.

Arsenic trioxide Mylan (arsenic trioxide) 
An overview of Arsenic trioxide Mylan and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is Arsenic trioxide Mylan and what is it used for? 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan is used to treat adults (aged 18 years or over) with acute promyelocytic 
leukaemia (APL), a rare form of leukaemia (cancer of the white blood cells) caused by a genetic 
‘translocation’ (when there is a swap of genes between two chromosomes). The translocation affects 
the way the white blood cells grow, and as a result they lack the ability to use retinoic acid (vitamin A). 
Patients with APL are normally treated with retinoids (substances derived from vitamin A). 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan is used in: 
• 
• 
patients with newly diagnosed low or intermediate risk APL where it is used together with the 
medicine all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA); 
patients with APL whose disease has not responded to previous treatment with a retinoid and 
cancer medicines, or when their disease has come back after this type of treatment. 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan is a ‘generic medicine’. This means that Arsenic trioxide Mylan contains the 
same active substance and works in the same way as a ‘reference medicine’ already authorised in the 
EU called Trisenox. For more information on generic medicines, see the question-and-answer 
document here. 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan contains the active substance arsenic trioxide. 
How is Arsenic trioxide Mylan used? 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan can only be obtained with a prescription and treatment should be supervised by 
a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with acute leukaemias. It is available as a 
concentrate that is made up into a solution for infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion should last one 
to two hours, but it may last longer if the patient has certain side effects. 
The recommended dose of Arsenic trioxide Mylan depends on the body weight of the patient. The 
treatment is divided into 2 phases: induction and consolidation. 
During the induction phase, Arsenic trioxide Mylan is given every day until there are signs that the 
treatment is working (when the bone marrow no longer contains any leukaemia cells). If this does not

happen by day 50 (for previously treated patients) or by day 60 (for newly diagnosed patients), the 
treatment should be stopped. 
During the consolidation phase, Arsenic trioxide Mylan is given once a day for five days, followed by a 
two-day break, repeated for four or five weeks. The number of times these cycles are repeated 
depends on whether patients have received previous treatment or not.  
For more information about using Arsenic trioxide Mylan, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor 
or pharmacist. 
How does Arsenic trioxide Mylan work? 
The active substance in Arsenic trioxide Mylan, arsenic trioxide, is a chemical that has been used in 
medicines for many years, including for the treatment of leukaemia. The way it works in this disease is 
not completely understood. It is thought to prevent the production of DNA, which is necessary for 
leukaemia cells to grow. 
How has Arsenic trioxide Mylan been studied? 
Studies on the benefits and risks of the active substance in the authorised use have already been 
carried out with the reference medicine, Trisenox, and do not need to be repeated for Arsenic trioxide 
Mylan.  
As for every medicine, the company provided studies on the quality of Arsenic trioxide Mylan. There 
was no need for ‘bioequivalence’ studies to investigate whether Arsenic trioxide Mylan is absorbed 
similarly to the reference medicine to produce the same level of the active substance in the blood. This 
is because Arsenic trioxide Mylan is given by infusion into a vein, so the active substance is delivered 
straight into the bloodstream. 
What are the benefits and risks of Arsenic trioxide Mylan? 
Because Arsenic trioxide Mylan is a generic medicine, its benefits and risks are taken as being the 
same as the reference medicine’s. 
Why is Arsenic trioxide Mylan authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Arsenic trioxide 
Mylan has been shown to be comparable to Trisenox. Therefore, the Agency’s view was that, as for 
Trisenox, the benefits of Arsenic trioxide Mylan outweigh the identified risks and it can be authorised 
for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Arsenic trioxide Mylan? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Arsenic trioxide Mylan have been included in the summary of product 
characteristics and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Arsenic trioxide Mylan are continuously monitored. Side effects 
reported with Arsenic trioxide Mylan are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect 
patients.

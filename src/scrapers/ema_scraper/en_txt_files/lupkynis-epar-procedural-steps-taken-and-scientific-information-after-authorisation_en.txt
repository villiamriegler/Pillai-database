Voclosporin is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
to update pharmacokinetic and safety information 
based on final results from study AUR-VCS-2021-02, 
safety data from Phase 2 and 3 studies submitted as 
part of the initial marketing authorisation application 
and post-marketing data. AUR-VCS-2021-02 is a 
single-center, open-label, Phase 1 study to 
investigate the effect of voclosporin on the 
transporters. In the study AUR-VCS-2021-02 / Statin-DDI, 
the concomitant administration of a single 40 mg dose of 
simvastatin with 23.7 mg BID voclosporin increased Cmax 
and AUC of the active metabolite simvastatin acid (a 
sensitive OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate) by 3.1-fold and 
1.8-fold, respectively. In the same study, exposure of the 
parent drug simvastatin (which is also a BCRP substrate) 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures.
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

was unaffected in terms of AUC while its Cmax increased by 
1.6-fold, which could potentially be attributed to an 
interaction between intestinal BCRP and voclosporin. It is 
recommended in the SmPC of Lupkynis to monitor for 
adverse events such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis 
when OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., simvastatin, 
atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin) are used 
concomitantly with voclosporin.
Voclosporin inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
in vitro. A clinically relevant inhibition of intestinal BCRP 
cannot be excluded and voclosporin may increase the 
concentration of these substrates in vivo. It is 
recommended in the SmPC of Lupkynis to monitor use of 
BCRP substrates where small concentration changes may 
lead to serious toxicity (e.g., rosuvastatin) when used 
concomitantly with voclosporin.

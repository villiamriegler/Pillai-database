Summary of risk management plan for Ruxience 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ruxience.  The RMP details 
important risks of Ruxience, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Ruxience's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ruxience summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ruxience should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Ruxience should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Ruxience's RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Ruxience indications in adults are: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Pemphigus vulgaris, Non-
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).   
Additionally, Ruxience is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients: 
•  aged ≥6 months to <18 years old, in combination with chemotherapy, in previously 
untreated advanced stage CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt 
lymphoma/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) or Burkitt-like lymphoma. 
•  aged ≥2 years to <18 years old, in combination with glucocorticoids, for the induction of 
remission in severe, active GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. 
It contains rituximab as the active substance, and it is given by intravenous (IV) route of 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ruxience benefits will be found in Ruxience 
European public assessment report (EPAR), including in its plain-language summary, 
available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ruxience.  
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Ruxience, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Ruxience risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In the case of Ruxience, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about AEs will be collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment- so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ruxience is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Ruxience are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of rituximab. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Indications) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Ruxience (rituximab) is a biosimilar medicinal product and the reference 
product (RP) is MabThera. The evidence of the above-mentioned risk is 
derived from the PF-05280586 and MabThera clinical trial data, and the 
MabThera risk management plan (RMP) which provides sufficient evidence 
from multiple sources (literature, clinical and/or post marketing). 
 
Table 2. Important Identified Risk: Infections, including serious infections (All 
Indications) 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
RA and GPA/MPA 
Patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at a higher risk of 
infection than the general population largely because of altered immunological 
function or other factors such as decreased mobility, or therapies used to treat 
the underlying disease (steroids, immunomodulating agents).1 A retrospective 
cohort study found that the rate of infection in RA patients was higher than in 
patients without RA in each of the 11 infection categories examined; sites 
associated with the highest relative risk were joints, bone, skin and soft 
tissues.1  The hazard ratio for the development of objectively confirmed 
infections in RA patients compared with non-RA patients, after adjustment for 
confounding variables, was 1.70.  Within RA patients, increasing age, 
presence of extra-articular manifestations of RA, and co-morbidities, as well 
as use of corticosteroids, were strong predictors of infection risk.  The 
predicting co-morbidities were chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, 
alcoholism, organic brain disease, and diabetes mellitus.  Of the disease 
modifying therapies examined, corticosteroids consistently increased infection 
risk.  In large studies, infection rates are clearly increased with 
cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, whereas methotrexate (MTX) appears to 
be associated with minimal, if any, increased infection risk.2 Data about other 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are scarce, and the main 
cause of therapy withdrawal is related to toxicity rather than infection.3  Anti-
tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) agents like infliximab (IFX) are associated 
with an increased risk for tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation and opportunistic infections (OIs).4  
Risk factors for infection in GPA/MPA patients include the concomitant use of 
high dose corticosteroids and/or other immunomodulatory agents. 
Pemphigus vulgaris 
None identified. 
NHL/CLL 
No risk factors or risk groups have been identified specifically for rituximab 
and the risk of infection is closely related to concomitant chemotherapy and 
the patient's underlying condition.  In a retrospective analysis by Bishop JF et 
al,5a higher infection rate in NHL patients was associated with 
granulocytopoenia and post splenectomy.  The commonest sites of infection 
were lung, skin, and alimentary canal.  Risk factors for infections identified in 
the literature in patients with CLL include advanced disease stage, previous 
antineoplastic therapy, refractoriness to fludarabine-based therapy, high serum 
b2-microglobulin level, low serum albumin level, low granulocyte count, and 
high serum creatinine concentration.6  
The risk of serious viral infection/reactivation is mainly related to concomitant 
chemotherapy and the patient's underlying condition.  Fludarabine, in 
particular, has been associated with an increased risk of serious viral infections 
including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and John Cunningham (JC) 
virus/progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and this is probably 
related to the induction of profound CD4+ lymphopenia.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
The risk of developing Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) among human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients rises markedly when circulating 
cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ cell counts fall below 200/µL.  A low 
CD4+ count is likely to be a major risk factor for opportunistic infections in 
other patients including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy 
(particularly glucocorticoids) for haematological malignancies such as NHL or 
CLL. Patients with CLL are predisposed to common as well as opportunistic 
infections as a result of a number of disease-related factors including 
immunoglobulin deficiency, abnormal T-cell function, and neutropenia 
resulting from infiltration of the bone marrow.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
RA 
PML has been reported in patients with autoimmune diseases (including SLE 
[systemic lupus erythematosus] and RA) who have received immunosuppressive 
agents. 
GPA/MPA 
Cyclophosphamide (CYC) is a risk factor for development of PML in GPA/MPA 
patients.  
Pemphigus vulgaris 
No information available. 
NHL/CLL 
PML almost exclusively occurs in immunocompromised patients. It may occur 
in patients with deficits in the humoral and/or cellular immune response such as 
lymphoproliferative diseases, myeloproliferative diseases, carcinomatous 
diseases and acquired immunodeficiency due to autoimmune diseases and 
immunosuppressive therapy. Fludarabine has been associated with an increased 
risk, possibly related to the induction a profound CD4+ lymphopenia.

Risk factors and risk

Patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy for defined periods of 
time for haematological, oncological or rheumatological diseases and as long-
term prophylaxis after bone marrow or solid organ transplantation are at an 
increased risk of HBV reactivation.1  
Risk minimisation 
measures 
NHL/CLL only 
HBV reactivation is a well-documented complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
in patients with cancer. Pre-treatment liver function tests and HBV 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels have been shown not to correlate with the 
risk of subsequent development of HBV reactivation. However, male sex, 
younger age, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seropositivity, and diagnosis of 
lymphoma have been reported as risk factors for reactivation. Severe reactivation 
also appears more likely when the chemotherapy is significantly 
immunosuppressive, when the viral load is high, and in the presence of precore 
mutant variant of HBV.

Ruxience (rituximab) is a biosimilar medicinal product, and the RP is MabThera. 
The evidence of the above-mentioned risk is derived from the MabThera RMP, 
which provides sufficient evidence from multiple sources (literature, clinical 
and/or post marketing). 
The RP SmPC provides recommendations to check the medicinal product labels 
to ensure that the appropriate formulation (intravenously [IV] or subcutaneous 
[SC] formulation) is being given to the patient, as prescribed. 
Based on the MabThera SC formulation clinical development, there were 2 
patients randomized to the SC arm who were inadvertently administered 
rituximab IV via SC route. No AEs were associated with errors in these patients 
who remained in the study. 
Based on the RP PM experience, the reporting rate of administration route error 
is very low. 
NHL and CLL population  
Administration route error could result from accidental substitution of the 
Branded rituximab (MabThera SC) which has subcutaneous formulation as well 
as intravenous formulations, being used instead of one of the rituximab 
biosimilars (including Ruxience), which are only available as IV formulations 
(eg, an error in the hospital pharmacy, or incorrect injection technique).

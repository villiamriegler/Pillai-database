Summary of risk management plan for Zokinvy (lonafarnib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zokinvy (lonafarnib). The RMP details 
important risks of Zokinvy, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be 
obtained about Zokinvy’ s risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
Zokinvy’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zokinvy should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Zokinvy  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Zokinvy’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lonafarnib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  12  months  of  age  and  older  a  genetically 
confirmed  diagnosis  of  Hutchinson-Gilford  Progeria  Syndrome  or  a  processing-deficient 
Progeroid Laminopathy associated with either a heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like 
protein accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutation. 
Further information about the evaluation of Zokinvy’s benefits can be found in Zokinvy’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zokinvy 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of lonafarnib, together with measures to minimise such risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, in the SmPC and PIL addressed to 
patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  lonafarnib,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned below under relevant important risks. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of lonafarnib is not yet available, it is listed 
under missing information below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  lonafarnib  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of lonafarnib. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Gastrointestinal toxicity is a well-known side effect of lonafarnib and have 
been seen in studies evaluating lonafarnib for other disease states (Error! 
Reference source not found.2008, Error! Reference source not 
found.2015). As found with other molecular-targeted compounds, diarrhoea 
can be managed by discontinuation of therapy or by use of antidiarrheal 
drugs. 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions (vomiting [85.7%], diarrhoea [77.8%], 
nausea [38.1%]) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions. 
Several organs are not affected by premature aging including the 
gastrointestinal tract (Error! Reference source not found.2016). Risk 
factors for GI disorders among children include a previous history of GI 
symptoms, children of parents with GI disorders, childhood abuse, anxiety, 
food allergies, and traveling to foreign countries (Error! Reference source 
not found.2010, Error! Reference source not found.1995, Error! 
Reference source not found.2017).  
Routine risk minimisation measures: The SmPC states that the dose of 
loperamide should not exceed 1 mg daily. 
 
The SmPC also states: Electrolyte abnormalities (hypermagnesaemia, 
hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia) have been reported. The severity of 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions, especially during the first 4 months of 
treatment, should be closely monitored. When gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions occur, monitoring the patient’s weight, caloric consumption, and 
fluid volume intake should be done on a regular basis. In some cases, 
persistent diarrhoea can result in hypovolaemia, which should be treated by 
infusion or orally. 
Prevention of treatment of vomiting and/or diarrhoea with an anti-emetic 
and/or anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product can be considered. For patients who 
have increased their dose to 150 mg/m2 twice daily and are experiencing 
repeated episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea resulting in dehydration or 
weight loss, the dose of lonafarnib can be lowered to the starting dose of 
115 mg/m2 twice daily. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Prospective Observational Study of Patients with Hutchinson-Gilford 
Progeria (HGPS) and Processing Deficient Progeroid Laminopathy (PDPL). 
Important Identified Risk: Increased AST/ALT 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Increased alanine aminotransferase was recorded for 14 (50.0% of patients) 
ProLon1 patients. Of the patients with increased alanine aminotransferase, 
11 (78.6%) patients experienced a Grade 1 increase (defined as greater than 
ULN to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; 1.5 to 3.0 times baseline if 
baseline was abnormal), 1 (7.1%) patient experienced a Grade 2 increase 
(defined as >3.0 to 5.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; >3.0 to 5.0 x 
baseline if baseline was abnormal), and 2 (14.3%) patients experienced a 
Grade 3 increase (defined as >5.0 to 20.0 x ULN if baseline was normal; 
>5.0 to 20.0 x baseline if baseline was abnormal).Increased aspartate 
aminotransferase was recorded for 18 (64.32%) of ProLon1 patients. Of 
these patients, 17 (94.4%) patients experienced a Grade 1 increase (defined 
as greater than ULN to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; 1.5 to 3.0 
times baseline if baseline was abnormal) and 1 (5.6%) patient experienced a 
Grade 3 increase (defined as >5.0 to 20.0 x ULN if baseline was normal; 
>5.0 to 20.0 x baseline if baseline was abnormal). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Liver disease 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
The SmPC states increased liver enzymes, such as aspartate 
aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase, have been reported. Signs and 
symptoms of reduced liver function should be assessed on a consistent basis. 
Liver function should be measured annually or at the onset of any new or 
worsening signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Prospective Observational Study of Patients with Hutchinson-Gilford 
Progeria (HGPS) and Processing Deficient Progeroid Laminopathy (PDPL) 
Important Identified Risk: Drug interaction with loperamide 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
When lonafarnib was co-administered with loperamide in healthy adult subjects, 
multiple dose lonafarnib (100 mg twice daily for 5 consecutive days) increased 
loperamide (single 2 mg oral dose) Cmax by 214% and AUC by 299%.  In the 
ProLon1 (BCH 07-01-007), 13 subjects received loperamide either 
intermittently or regularly throughout the trial to prevent or treat diarrhoea. Of 
these, 7 subjects experienced constipation in response to prophylactic 
loperamide administration.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients taking lonafarnib and loperamide. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
The SmPC states: When lonafarnib was co-administered with loperamide in 
healthy adult subjects, multiple dose lonafarnib (100 mg twice daily for 5 
consecutive days) increased loperamide (single 2 mg oral dose) Cmax by 214% 
and AUC by 299%. The dose of loperamide should not exceed 1 mg daily. In 
the event more than 1 mg of loperamide daily is to be administered, the dose 
should be slowly increased with caution as needed to treat diarrhoea. 
The SmPC also states that patients experiencing diarrhoea and treated with the 
anti-diarrhoeal loperamide should be monitored for adverse reactions associated 
with increased exposure to loperamide. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None.

(HGPS) and Processing Deficient Progeroid Laminopathy PD(PL). 
Important Potential Risk: Drug Interaction with parenterally administered midazolam and other sensitive 
CYP3A or CYP2C19 substrates  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
A Phase 1, open-label, single-centre, two-period, single-sequence, multi-drug-
drug interaction study in healthy subjects has been completed to evaluate the 
effects of multiple-dose lonafarnib on the pharmacokinetics of single-dose 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, and in parallel, the effects of multiple-
dose lonafarnib on the pharmacokinetics of single-dose fexofenadine, a sensitive 
P-gp substrate. A total of 17 subjects enrolled and completed the study. The 
results of the study indicate that lonafarnib is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Based on 
the findings of this study, sensitive substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic 
index should be monitored closely during concomitant administration with 
lonafarnib and ritonavir. 
In vitro data suggest lonafarnib may inhibit P-gp, as the presence of lonafarnib 
resulted in a 95.3% inhibition P-gp in Caco-2 clone cell monolayers using 
digoxin as a probe substrate. An IC50 assessment was performed, resulting in an 
IC50 of 0.740 µM. Based on these results, an in vivo confirmatory DDI study 
was required. In this study, a single 180 mg fexofenadine dose will be 
administered on 2 separate occasions, with and without multiple-dose 
lonafarnib. The lonafarnib dose used will be 100 mg twice daily and is expected 
to maximise steady-state lonafarnib exposures while staying below the 
maximum tolerated dose.  
Lonafarnib is a potent in vivo CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitor and, when 
given concomitantly with either lovastatin, simvastatin or atorvastatin, is 
expected to increase the plasma concentrations of these statins. This results in an 
increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  
Sensitive CYP3A substrates  
When lonafarnib was co-administered with midazolam in healthy adult subjects, 
multiple dose lonafarnib (100 mg twice daily for 5 consecutive days) increased 
midazolam (single 3 mg oral dose) Cmax by 180% and AUC by 639%. This 
interaction thereby increases the risk of extreme sedation and respiratory 
depression.  
Sensitive CYP2C19 substrates 
Risk factors and risk groups 
When lonafarnib was co-administered with the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole 
in healthy adult subjects, multiple dose lonafarnib (75 mg twice daily for 5 
consecutive days) increased omeprazole (single 40 mg oral dose) Cmax by 28% 
and AUC by 60%. 
Concomitant administration of lonafarnib with sensitive CYP3A or CYP2C19 
substrates and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, including 
herbal supplements.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
The SmPC states that concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors are 
contraindicated. Concomitant use of medicinal products that are predominately 
metabolised by CYP3A4, such as midazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin and 
atorvastatin are contraindicated. 
The SmPC states that patients requiring parenteral midazolam for a surgical 
procedure should discontinue lonafarnib for 14 days before and 2 days after 
administration of midazolam.  
The SmPC states that patients taking medicinal products that are CYP2C19 
substrates should be monitored during this period for potential adverse 
reactions, with dose adjustments made, as necessary. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None.

Important Potential Risk: Drug interaction with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Lonafarnib is a potent in vivo CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitor and, when 
given concomitantly with either lovastatin, simvastatin or atorvastatin, is 
expected to increase the plasma concentrations of these statins. This results in an 
increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  
No interaction studies have been conducted with a weak CYP3A inhibitor. No 
dose adjustment is considered necessary; however, if the concomitant use of a 
weak CYP3A inhibitor induces a persistent toxicity, the dose of lonafarnib 
should be reduced by 50% and QTc monitoring is recommended. 
When lonafarnib was co-administered with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, in healthy adult subjects, ketoconazole (200 mg for 5 doses) increased 
lonafarnib (single dose of 50 mg) Cmax by 270% and AUC by 425%. This may 
lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions. 
Risk factors and risk group 
Concomitant administration of lonafarnib with weak CYP3A inhibitors.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
The SmPC states that if the concomitant use of a weak CYP3A inhibitor induces 
a persistent toxicity, the dose of lonafarnib should be reduced by 50% and QTc

The SmPC also states that the patient should resume the BSA indicated dose of 
lonafarnib 14 days after the toxicity has fully resolved or discontinuation of the 
weak CYP3A inhibitor.

Study title: 
Prospective  Observational  Study  of  Patients  with  Hutchinson-Gilford  Progeria  (HGPS)  and 
Processing Deficient Progeroid Laminopathy (PDPL) 
Rationale and study objectives: 
HGPS and processing deficient PL (PDPL) are rare genetic disorders characterised by the 
presence of aging-associated symptoms, including lack of subcutaneous fat, alopecia, swollen 
veins, growth retardation, age spots, joint contractures, osteoporosis, cardiovascular pathology, 
and death due to heart attacks and strokes in childhood (Error! Reference source not 
found.2019). 
Currently, lonafarnib is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of HGPS and processing 
deficient PLs in patients one year of age and older. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib 
demonstrated survival benefits in two clinical trials (Error! Reference source not found. 2014, 
Error! Reference source not found. 2018). Post-marketing safety data on lonafarnib would be 
valuable given the potential for lifelong treatment with lonafarnib. This study is intended to 
collect long-term data on safety and effectiveness of lonafarnib, and patient-reported HRQoL 
among patients with HGPS and PDPL, which is designated as a post-authorisation safety study 
(PASS) commitment for European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of 
lonafarnib treatment among patients with HGPS or a processing-deficient PL in real-world 
clinical care settings and assess important identified and potential risks, and missing information  
Primary objective 
Among patients with HGPS or a processing-deficient PL managed in a real-world setting: 
 
•  Characterise safety events during treatment with lonafarnib including AEs, SAEs, and 
AESIs including vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, 
upper respiratory tract infection, decreased weight, decreased appetite, and dehydration. 
Secondary objectives 
•  Describe the overall survival  
•  Evaluate the incidence of MACEs  
•  Assess HRQoL 
•  Describe concomitant use of medications that may interact with lonafarnib (loperamide, 
parenterally administered midazolam and other sensitive cytochrome P450, family 3, 
subfamily A (CYP3A) or cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) substrates, weak 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates, and select 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors) and 
occurrence of safety events 
•  Describe occurrence of increased aspartate transaminase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) 
•  Describe use of lonafarnib among patients with severe hepatic impairment

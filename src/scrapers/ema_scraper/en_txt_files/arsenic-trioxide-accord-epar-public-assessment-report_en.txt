2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application is for marketing authorization of Arsenic trioxide Accord 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution 
for infusion and is based on Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10 (1): a generic application, referring to the 
reference Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion of Teva B.V. which has been authorised 
in accordance with Union provisions in force for not less than 10 years in the EEA.  Trisenox 1 mg/ml 
concentrate for solution for infusion was first authorised within the EU on the 05-03-2002 under 
registration number EU/1/02/204/001. 
The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes 
morphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 
human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the 
fusion protein Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic Acid Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR alpha). 
The reference product Trisenox is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer 
products in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The currently approved indication for 
Trisenox is as follows: 
TRISENOX is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell 
count, ≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
examined.

EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 8/18 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of arsenic trioxide is Arsenic (III) oxide corresponding to the molecular formula 
As2O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 197.84 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by a combination of crystallography 
(XRD) for characterization of the cubic crystal form, thermogravimetric analysis, hygroscopy and IR 
spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off white crystalline powder, practically insoluble to 
sparingly soluble in water. It dissolves in solutions of alkali hydroxides (NaOH 1 M), but is less soluble in 
acids. It is practically insoluble in ethanol, chloroform and ethyl ether.  
Arsenic trioxide has a non - chiral molecular structure.  Polymorphism has been observed. The cubic 
crystal form is used. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is synthesized in 3 main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specification.   
Critical steps identified are well controlled during production. No In Process Controls or specifications of 
intermediate products are established. The specifications and control methods for starting materials and 
reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in white opaque high-density polyethylene bottle with blue closure as a 
primary container which complies with the EC regulation 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification from the finished product manufacturer includes tests for appearance 
(visual), solubility (Ph.Eur.), identification (chemical, HPLC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (titration), metallic arsenic (gravimetric), As2O5 content (HPLC) , loss on drying 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 9/18 
 
 
 
 
 
(Ph. Eur.), metallic impurities (ICP-OES) , iron content (ICP-OES), endotoxins (LAL test), and microbial 
analysis (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities are not present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A. Appropriate 
specifications have been set.  
The controls that are currently associated with the active substance process ensure that the levels of 
potential elemental impurities are maintained below their respective PDEs as established for the 
parenteral route of administration in the finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described or referenced, where relevant, and 
(non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH and 30ºC / 75% HR)) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The tests and analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All results comply with the specification. The long term data and accelerated data show no changes over 
time and only little variability. Based on this data an extrapolation of the retest period beyond the period 
covered by long term data is proposed according to ICH Q1E “Note for guidance on evaluation of stability 
data” and it is acceptable. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months if it is preserved in 
tight containers protected from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product arsenic trioxide 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear and colourless 
aqueous solution. The solution is sterile, non-pyrogenic and essentially free of particles.  
The finished product has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product 
Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. Consequently, the objective was to prepare a 
parenteral formulation being essentially similar to the reference medicinal product. 
The active substance is practically insoluble to sparingly soluble in water. It dissolves in solutions of alkali 
hydroxides (1M NaOH).  
It is considered that the qualitative and quantitative composition of the generic medicinal product is 
similar to that of the reference medicinal product. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
 
For the development of the formulation the following representative points (quality target product profile) 
were taken into consideration: qualitative / quantitative composition should be similar to reference 
medicinal product; sterility must be met during release, shelf life and in-use period; specific (compendial) 
requirements for parenteral preparations should be ensured; establishing a manufacturing technology so 
as to ensure continuity in solution preparation, by optimal and reliable production parameters; 
sterilization of the finished product by filtration through a bacteria-retentive filter, followed by aseptic vial 
filling in sterile primary packaging should be used; and finally, sterilization of filled and sealed vials. The 
finished product obtained as a result of pharmaceutical development has been assessed with regard to its 
physico-chemical parameters and stability. The developed product is regarded to be comparable to the 
reference medicinal product. 
In relation to the manufacturing process development, different manufacturing steps (bulk solution 
preparation, filtration, vial filling, and terminal sterilization) were assessed carefully and a gentle 
procedure ensuring the production of a finished product of reliable quality has been chosen.  
The primary packaging is Type I transparent colourless glass vial sealed with a silicon-oil free, elastomer 
type, grey rubber stopper and aluminium seal with a plastic flip off cap. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is a sterile product manufactured by sterilization of filled vials.  The manufacturing 
process consists of 5 main steps: weighing of the incoming materials, preparation of bulk solution, 
pre-filtration, vial filling (the step includes 2nd filtration and filling), and terminal sterilization.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies in three commercial 
scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance, identification (HPLC, chemical), pH (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.), and bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities may well be present in the finished product, but these compounds are likely to originate from 
active substance synthesis and are adequately controlled in the active substance. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. From the assessment of 
the finished product components, the daily contribution to the total mass of elemental impurities that may 
be present in the finished product was calculated. Calculation option 2b was used based on the maximum 
expected concentration of elemental impurities which may be present in the individual components also 
considering the actual maximum daily intake of the finished product. This calculation revealed that the 
total daily intake of Class 1  and Class 2A as well as Class 3 elements  is far below the 30% control 
threshold for parenteral permissible daily exposure (PDEs). Actual testing revealed levels considerably 
lower than those predicted using calculation Option 2b. Thus, no additional controls are to be imparted in 
the finished product specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 11/18 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, pH, extractable volume, assay, particulate contamination, related 
substances, bacterial endotoxins, and sterility. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
No significant observations were recognized under long term stability conditions. All results of testing at 
accelerated conditions met the specifications established for shelf life and confirm a satisfying stability of 
the final finished product at this storage condition. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The data demonstrates that during the study neither the physical nor 
the chemical properties of the finished product exposed to light show significant changes. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the finished product is not sensitive to light. 
Identically with the innovator product, Arsenic Trioxide Accord must be diluted with 100 to 250 ml of 
glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection 
immediately after withdrawal from the vial. The applicant performed an in-use stability study on the 
finished product. The results were comparable to those from the reference product and clearly 
demonstrate that stability of the finished product during the shelf life when diluted in 0.9 % sodium 
chloride or 50 mg/mL (5 %) glucose solution when stored up to 48 hours at 2-8 °C, or up to 24 hours at 
room temperature. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25 °C and 48 hours at 2°C 
to 8°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product must be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C-8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and 
validated aseptic conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 12/18 
 
 
 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Arsenic trioxide Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all arsenic trioxide containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
The impurity profile of applicant’s Arsenic trioxide is comparable to that of Trisenox. Thus, additional 
toxicology studies to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Arsenic trioxide Accord is a generic of the reference product Trisenox. 
The literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of 
non-clinical aspects of Arsenic trioxide Accord in the applied indications.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided. The Clinical 
sections of the SmPC of Arsenic trioxide Accord are in accordance with the reference product Trisenox 1 
mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, first authorised within the EU on the 05-03-2002 under 
registration number EU/1/02/204/001.  
Relevant for the assessment is the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **).  
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product. The 
CHMP considers that the clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety is adequate. 
Exemption  
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application. According to Appendix II to the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), 
bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous 
intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product. This is the 
case here. Both products, generic product Arsenic trioxide Accord and the reference product Trisenox, 
contain 1.0 mg of the same active substance, arsenic trioxide, and the same excipients. Therefore, it is 
concluded that there is no difference between the Arsenic trioxide Accord and Trisenox. A bioequivalence 
study is not required. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety has been provided and is adequate.  
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application, this is in accordance with the Appendix 
II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). 
Arsenic trioxide Accord is considered essentially similar to Trisenox Teva B.V. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Arsenic trioxide Accord and justifications that 
the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Trisenox (for text content) and Solifenacin succinat Accord 
5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets (for the layout). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Arsenic trioxide Accord 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The indication of the reference product Trisenox is as follows:  
Trisenox is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood 
cell count, ≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/580349/2019  
Page 16/18 
 
 
 
 
examined.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Arsenic trioxide Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Arsenic trioxide is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white  blood 
cell count, ≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)(Previous treatment should   have 
included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic 
Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been 
examined.

Summary of risk management plan for Sogroya 
(somapacitan)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sogroya. The RMP details 
important risks of Sogroya, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about Sogroya’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Sogroya’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) 
give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how 
Sogroya should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Sogroya should be read in the context of all the 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the EPAR. 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in the 
updates of Sogroya’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
Sogroya has been authorised for the indications of adults with growth hormone 
deficiency (AGHD) and paediatric GHD (see SmPC for the full indications). Sogroya 
contains somapacitan, a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 
derivative and it is given once weekly by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Sogroya’s benefits can be found in 
Sogroya’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website under the medicine’s webpage: EPAR link. 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Sogroya, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Sogroya’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be as follows: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PL and the SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sogroya is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Sogroya are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Sogroya. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).  
In connection with the submission of application for the paediatric GHD indication and 
the 15 mg/1.5 mL strength, the important potential risk ‘Off-label paediatric use’ has 
been removed.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Overall, based on the medical evaluation from the below sources, 
no causal relationship has been identified supporting an 
association with somapacitan and neoplasms. 
  Completed Sogroya phase 3a clinical trials 
  Post-marketing safety surveillance of marketed GH products 
  Literature of marketed GH products 
  Consensus safety report  
  Patients with previous neoplasms have an increased risk of 
relapse of the same tumour type without treatment due to the 
nature of the disease. 
  Patients with prior neoplasms may have an increased risk of 
developing second neoplasms when treated with GH, especially 
if they had received prior treatment with radiotherapy. The risk 
of second neoplasms in patients with previous neoplasms 
treated with growth hormone treatment (GHT) was lower after 
an extended follow-up and became non-significant after 
adjusting for sex, age at primary diagnosis, dose/time, and 
treatment type. A recent metanalysis does not find increased 
risks of recurrence or second neoplasms in childhood cancer 
survivors treated with GH.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
In the observational Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short 
Stature International Study (GeNeSIS), data from 11,686 GH-
treated patients were analysed for incidence of diabetes mellitus. 
In the GHD subpopulation (age 0−19 years), the incidence rate 
was 30.4 per 100,000 patient-years of exposure for type 1 
diabetes and 40.5 for type 2 diabetes. 
From the Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS), the 
incidence of diabetes was investigated in a cohort of 5,143 AGHD. 
Mean follow-up time was 3.9 years with a total number of 
20,106 patient-years. In total, 10% of the patients developed 
diabetes after a median period of 1.7 years. The overall incidence 
of diabetes was 26 per 1,000 patient-years. The incidence 
gradually decreased from the highest level of 41 per 1,000 
patient-years during the first year of GH treatment to 10 per 
1,000 patient-years after more than 8 years of GH treatment. The 
incidence was the same for both genders. When compared to both 
the Swedish as well as other (European and US) age-matched 
reference populations the diabetes incidence in KIMS was 
significantly higher. The authors note that the patients who 
developed diabetes differed at baseline with regards to the 
classical risk factors of diabetes (e.g., being older, having a higher 
BMI, waist circumference, triglyceride concentrations, and blood 
pressure) compared to the patients who did not develop diabetes, 
and further, that the presence of any of these risk factors 
considerably increases the risk of developing diabetes.

Paediatric GHD 
Register-based study NN8640-4787 
Novo Nordisk will conduct a long-term post-authorisation register-based study in 
paediatric patients with GHD. This is a non-interventional, observational, register-
based study to investigate long-term safety and clinical parameters of once-weekly 
somapacitan treatment in paediatric patients with GHD in the setting of routine clinical 
practice. 
Purpose of the study 
The aim of this register-based study is to evaluate long-term safety and clinical 
parameters of once-weekly Sogroya treatment in paediatric GHD in the setting of 
routine clinical practice. 
Clinical trial NN8640-4172 (phase 2) 
This is a randomised, multinational, active-controlled (open-labelled), dose finding 
(double-blinded), parallel group trial investigating efficacy and safety of once-weekly 
somapacitan treatment compared to daily GH treatment (Norditropin) in GH treatment 
naïve pre-pubertal children with GHD. 
The trial has completed the main trial period and is now in the long-term safety 
extension period. 
Purpose of the trial 
The overall purpose of the trial is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 
multiple dose regimens of once-weekly somapacitan treatment in GH treatment naïve 
pre-pubertal children with GHD, compared to daily Norditropin. 
Clinical trial NN8640-4263 (phase 3a) 
This is a randomised trial comparing the effect and safety of once-weekly dosing of 
somapacitan with daily Norditropin in children with GHD. 
The trial has completed the main trial period and is now in the safety extension 
period.  
Purpose of the trial 
The overall purpose of the trial is to compare the effect and safety of once-weekly 
somapacitan vs daily Norditropin  in children with GHD. 
Adults with growth hormone deficiency 
Post-authorisation safety study NN8640-4515 
Novo Nordisk will conduct a long-term post-authorisation safety study (PASS) in 
patients with AGHD. This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, single-arm, 
observational, non-interventional PASS to investigate long-term safety of Sogroya in 
AGHD under routine clinical practice. 
Purpose of the study 
The primary aim of this PASS is to characterise the long-term safety profile of Sogroya 
with special focus on the important potential risks (diabetes mellitus type 2, 
neoplasms and medication errors). Therefore, this PASS may allow a further 
evaluation of these potential risks in relation to treatment with Sogroya. Medication 
errors are of specific interest since some patients will switch from daily GH injections 
to weekly injections with Sogroya. Therefore, the PASS may provide information on 
whether this might lead to medication errors in clinical practice.

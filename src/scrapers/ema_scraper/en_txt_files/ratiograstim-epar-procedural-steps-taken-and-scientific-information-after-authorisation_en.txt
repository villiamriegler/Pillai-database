1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The SmPC section 6.4 has been updated as follows: 
Within its shelf-life and for ambulatory use, the product 
may be removed from the refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) and 
stored at a temperature up to 25 °C for one single period of 
up to 4 days. If not used within 4 days, the product may be

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.  Problem statement 
Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) is a serious, debilitating, chronic disorder that occurs when 
individuals are unable to synchronize their endogenous circadian clock to the 24-hour light-dark cycle. The 
majority of reported cases of Non-24 occur in blind patients with no conscious perception of light.  ‎As a result of 
light information failing to reach the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to synchronize the clock and its outputs, the 
pacemaker may revert to its endogenous non-24-hour period. The result of this lack of entrainment is the 
gradual shifting of the endogenous rhythm as compared to the social/environmental 24-hour clock.  The 
progressive shifting of the rhythm also produces a cyclical remission during which alignment will be achieved 
every 1 to 16 months depending on the period of the endogenous clock. 
In Non-24, the timing of physiology and behaviour that is controlled by the circadian system (e.g. the timing of 
melatonin and cortisol production, the core body temperature rhythm, metabolic processes, the sleep-wake 
cycle, and alertness and performance patterns) becomes desynchronized from the 24-hour day, which has 
serious consequences on the daily functioning of the patient. Non-24 is associated with significant clinical 
symptoms which are often mistakenly diagnosed as related to insomnia, rather than as a result of a 
non-entrained circadian clock, often leading to inappropriate therapeutic interventions. For some totally blind 
individuals, the sleeplessness and daytime somnolence that result from being non-entrained have profound 
impacts on their social and occupational lives and can be considered the most disabling aspects of their 
blindness. The ultimate goal in treating individuals with Non-24 is to entrain their circadian clock with the 
24-hour day so that the timing of their physiology and behaviour is synchronized appropriately with the 24-hour 
social day. 
Onset of Non-24 can occur at any age, from birth onward, and usually coincides with or follows shortly after the 
total loss of light perception or loss or surgical removal of the eyes. The risk of developing Non-24 ultimately 
depends on the risk of complete loss of circadian photoreceptive function rather than on the cause of blindness; 
any ocular disorder which abolishes light-dark input to the circadian pacemaker and prevents entrainment to the 
light-dark cycle can lead to Non-24. Eye disorders that damage the ganglion cell layer (e.g., glaucoma), affect 
the optic nerve (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity), or cause removal of the eye entirely (e.g., retinoblastoma, 
trauma) are more likely to result in total blindness, prevent circadian entrainment, and therefore increase the 
likelihood of Non-24. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 9/79 
 
  
  
  
Non-24 should be suspected in any totally blind individual who presents with a chronic history of a severe 
sleep-wake disorder.  More than half and as many as seventy percent of the totally blind patients are expected 
to have Non-24, making the disorder one of the most prevalent conditions among the totally blind with an 
estimated prevalence of 1.5  to 2.2  persons per 10,000 in the EU Community. (8-10)  According to the European 
portal for rare diseases (Orphanet), the prevalence rate of Non-24 (Hypernychthemeral syndrome, ORPHA 
number 73267) is estimated to be 18.5 per 100,000 individuals in the EU. There is currently no other approved 
treatment for Non-24 in the EU.  
2.3.  About the product 
Tasimelteon is a circadian regulator that resets the master body clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).  
Tasimelteon is a Dual Melatonin Receptor Agonist (DMRA) with selective agonist activity at the MT1 and MT2 
receptors believed to act in the SCN. All of tasimelteon’s main metabolites (M3, M9, M11, M12, M13, and M14) 
bind to the melatonin receptors but with less affinity than the parent. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 20 mg of tasimelteon as active substance. 
Other ingredients of the capsule core are: anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, 
colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate. Ingredients of the hard capsule shell are: gelatin, titanium 
dioxide, brilliant blue FCF, erythrosine, orange yellow S (E110). Ingredients of the printing ink are: shellac, 
propylene glycol, sodium hydroxide, povidone K17, and titanium dioxide. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle containing 30 hard capsules with 
polypropylene child-resistant closures containing polypropylene resin induction seals. Each bottle also contains 
a 1.5-g silica gel desiccant canister and polyester dunnage. Single HDPE bottle is provided in paperboard carton. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tasimelteon is (1R, 2R)-N-[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-4-yl)cyclopropylmethyl] 
propanamide and has the following structure: 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 10/79 
 
  
  
  
 
The chemical structure of tasimelteon has been adequately demonstrated by elemental analysis, IR and UV 
absorption spectroscopy, 1H, 13C, and COSY (Correlation Spectroscopy) nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation, and 
mass spectrometry (MS, including MS/MS). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was used additionally in 
order to determine the molecular structure, solid state conformation, and relative and absolute stereo 
configuration of tasimelteon. 
Tasimelteon is a white to off-white crystalline powder, it is non hygroscopic, soluble in water across relevant pH 
values and freely soluble in alcohols, cyclohexane, and acetonitrile. Conducted in vivo studies demonstrate that 
tasimelteon is highly permeable substance. Photostability testing and testing on stress conditions demonstrated 
that the active substance degrades in light. 
Tasimelteon exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Active substance is 
manufactured as a single, trans-1R,2R isomer. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely during manufacture of 
active substance intermediates by chiral HPLC/specific optical rotation and additionally controlled in the active 
substance. Stability data indicates tasimelteon is isomerically stable. 
Polymorphism has been observed in polymorphic screening studies for tasimelteon and two forms have been 
identified. The thermodynamically more stable form has been chosen for development and the manufacturing 
process consistently yields active substance of single, desired polymorphic form. It was demonstrated that 
milling of the active substance does not affect polymorphic form. Polymorphism is additionally controlled in 
active substance release and shelf-life specifications using X-ray powder diffraction analysis. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance intended for the proposed commercial process is obtained from a single manufacturer. 
During the development, two additional manufacturers of active substance were used. The quality of the active 
substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by 
the proposed commercial process. 
Tasimelteon is synthesized in nine main steps using linear synthesis and using commercially available 
well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Three intermediates are isolated for control of 
active substance quality including stereochemical control. The active substance is isolated by slow 
recrystallisation or precipitation of tasimelteon from an ethanol/water mixture which ensures the formation of 
desired polymorphic form. Up to two additional, optional recrystallisations may be performed for unmilled 
tasimelteon to ensure that milled tasimelteon active substance is of high purity. Seed crystals complying with 
active substance specifications can be used optionally. Active substance is jet milled (micronised) to reduce and 
control particle size, which is critical in finished product performance with regards to content uniformity and 
dissolution. 
The active substance is not sterile, and therefore process validation data is not required. However, the validation 
results of three consecutive validation batches at the proposed commercial manufacturing site were provided. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The active substance is packaged in double low density polyethylene bags each closed with a twist tie inside a 
sealed polyethylene terephthalate/aluminium/LDPE bag. A silica desiccant is placed inside the aluminium bag. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 11/79 
 
  
  
  
The aluminium bag is finally placed inside a 6-L paper drum with matching paper lid. The materials chosen for 
the packaging comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 and are suitable to protect the active 
substance from moisture and light. Each batch of polyethylene bags is tested prior to use. The secondary 
packaging is suitable to protect the active substance during transportation and storage. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, specific rotation, chiral HPLC), 
melting point (Ph. Eur., DSC), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), chiral purity (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), polymorphic form (XRPD), particle size (laser diffraction), and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The specifications for potentially genotoxic impurities are well below the Threshold of 
Toxicological Concern (TTC) as established in the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data (n=16, commercial scale) of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer were 
provided. Batch analysis data from two additional manufacturers used for manufacturing pre-clinical and clinical 
batches were provided as supporting information. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 10 commercial scale batches of unmilled and 8 commercial scale batches of milled active 
substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended 
for the market for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing 
following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 2 batches. Results of stress studies under acidic, alkaline, 
oxidation, photolysis, heat, and heat in solution conditions were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity (IR, chiral HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), water 
content (KF), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), chiral purity (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), polymorphic form 
(XRPD), particle size (laser diffraction), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable when stored in the original package. All tested parameters were within the specifications. The stability 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The proposed commercial finished product formulation of tasimelteon is Size 1, dark blue opaque, hard gelatin 
capsules printed with “VANDA 20 mg” in white, containing 20 mg of tasimelteon per capsule. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable immediate release solid dosage form for oral 
use, providing high bioavailability of the active substance. Tasimelteon is classified as highly soluble and highly 
permeable substance according to BCS classification system. 
The key attributes of the active substance affecting finished product quality are compatibility of active substance 
with excipients, water content, solubility, permeability, particle size, agglomeration, polymorphism, and 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 12/79 
 
  
  
  
stability. Dissolution is the main parameter that can influence the in vivo performance of the finished product. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
Agglomeration of the active substance on storage has been noticed. The impact of agglomeration on the quality 
of the active substance has been investigated and the agglomerates have been found not to affect the crystal 
form or chemical stability of the active substance. However, the manufacturing process of the finished product 
includes controls to minimise agglomeration including a hold time of 12 weeks for the milled active substance. 
Specification limits for both active substance agglomerates and particle size of active substance, anhydrous 
lactose and microcrystalline cellulose have been set to ensure the quality of the finished product. 
A screening study on the binary mixes of the active substance and excipients, stored at elevated temperature 
and humidity was performed. In summary, the active substance showed good compatibility with the excipients 
tested. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottle. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  five  mixing  steps  and  encapsulation.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. It has been demonstrated that there is no interconversion of polymorphic form of active substance 
during  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process for hard capsules. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification  (UV,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution 
(HPLC), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches used for the validation of manufacturing 
process. A number of additional supporting batch analysis results have been provided, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications through traditional final 
product release testing. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 13/79 
 
  
  
  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), 
disintegration (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. Stability results show that no significant changes of the physical or chemical characteristics 
have been observed in the tested batches. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical pharmacology programme for tasimelteon consisted of pharmacodynamic studies;  in vitro 
assays and in vivo and ex vivo studies in rat. Safety pharmacology studies were performed in vitro and in vivo 
to evaluate the potential cardiovascular effects of tasimelteon. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to 
determine ADME and drug-drug interaction potential. The nonclinical toxicology programme consisted of 35 
studies including acute and repeated dose studies, genotoxicity assays, carcinogenicity studies, and the 
evaluation of reproductive and developmental toxicity. Local tolerance and abuse liability studies were also 
conducted.  
All pivotal toxicity studies and the majority of other studies were conducted in accordance with GLP. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In radioligand binding studies tasimelteon showed potent inhibition of  2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding at the MT1 
and  MT2  receptors,  with  a  Ki  of  0.35  nM  and  0.17  nM,  respectively.  In  a  dose-response  assay  tasimelteon 
inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with a pEC50 ~9 nM.  In two separate screens, using 63 and 
170  different  targets  at  10  and  100  µM,  and  170  different  receptors  at  10  µM  tasimelteon,  there  were  no 
interactions  identified  as  significant  (50% inhibition at  10  µM).  A  number  of  receptors  showed  potential  for 
binding with IC50 concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Given the expected clinical CMAX is about 1 µM, and 
tasimelteon is highly protein bound, these secondary binding interactions do not appear to be clinically relevant. 
Overall the in vitro assays support the characterisation of tasimelteon as a potent, specific agonist at the MT1 
and MT2 receptors. 
The affinity and potency of the metabolites M3, M9, M11, M12, M13, and M14 were determined in a series of 
radioligand binding assays. Each metabolite showed some inhibitory response at the MT1 and MT2, although at 
least one order of magnitude lower than that of tasimelteon. Based on IC50 and Ki, the rank order of potency for 
human  melatonin  receptors  MT1  and  MT2  was  tasimelteon  followed  by  M13,  M14,  M11,  M12  and  M9,  with 
consistent  higher  potency  for  the  MT2  receptor.  The  data  suggest  that  although  there  is  a  potential  for 
pharmacological inhibition of the MT1/2 receptors by the circulating metabolites, significant interaction is not 
expected  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations.  Binding  assays  for  163  non-related  targets  did  not  identify 
significant  activity  with  any  of  the  metabolites  tested,  and  do  not  indicate  a  potential  for  clinically  relevant 
interactions. 
In an ex vivo study to evaluate the chronobiotic efficacy of tasimelteon, a dose of 5 mg/kg (s.c. injection) was 
shown to shift the peak of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) electrical activity rhythm of rats after 2 days in a 
reversed light-dark cycle, similarly to melatonin (1 mg/kg). A lower dose of tasimelteon (1 mg/kg) had no effect 
in this model. 
Two independent in vivo studies showed also that, upon chronic administration (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg s.c.) in rats 
showing "free running" circadian rhythms in constant darkness, tasimelteon was able to shift the onset of 
running-wheel activity (Study 52274), and was able to entrain it (Study 52273).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Two studies were conducted to assess the vasoconstrictor properties of tasimelteon, and to compare them to 
that of melatonin, which has previously been shown to modulate vascular smooth muscle tone and in particular 
to induce vasoconstriction of rat caudal and cerebral arteries, and human coronary arteries.  
Tasimelteon produced vasoconstrictive effects in isolated rat caudal artery, which was predicted based on the 
distribution of melatonin binding sites in the rat caudal arteries. Based on EC50 and Emax values, tasimelteon 
was less potent and efficacious than melatonin. In isolated rat anterior cerebral arteries, tasimelteon showed 
some vasoconstrictive effects, with less maximal constriction, roughly 500-fold less potently than melatonin. 
The studies were consistent with the known distribution of melatonin receptors in the vasculature, and the 
expected pharmacology of an MT receptor agonist. The findings also correlated with the observed increased 
mean arterial blood pressure seen in cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in anaesthetised dogs. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Specific studies were conducted to assess the effect of tasimelteon on the cardiovascular system but no 
dedicated central nervous system or respiratory system safety studies were conducted in animals. 
The studies are summarised in Table 1 below.

There was no significant change

ECG analysis shows no effect 
on QRS width and QT or PR 
interval for either the 
tasimelteon or melatonin 
treated dogs as compared to

Two in vitro studies were conducted to assess the effect of tasimelteon on the hERG potassium channel current 
in human embryonic kidney cells (Study 070227.WBO) and on action potentials in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibres 
(Study 070228.WBO). Results show a lack of noteworthy inhibitory effect of tasimelteon on hERG potassium 
current and generally the absence of prolonged action potential repolarisation in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibres, 
at concentrations significantly higher than the average human maximum plasma concentration (Cmax = 238 
ng/mL, Day 20 in clinical Study VP-VEC-162-1110) observed at the 20 mg/day therapeutic dose. Based on the 
reported human Cmax, changes in the action potential duration observed at the highest concentration tested of 
100 μM (~24.5 μg/mL), equate to ~100 times higher than the average human Cmax. 
Following intravenous administration, tasimelteon (3 mg/kg) was shown to produce a 14% reduction in mean 
arterial blood pressure (MABP) in anesthetised dogs. The applicant has determined that the human equivalent 
dose of 1.7 mg/kg is comparable to the 3 mg administered to dogs i.v. This dose corresponds to an oral dose of 
267 mg hence would 16x higher than the proposed human oral dose of 20 mg daily. Therefore the in terms of 
clinical significance of the 14% reduction in MABP seen in dogs; an adequate human safety margin can be 
applied. This is supported further by the reported absence of reported fluctuations in blood pressure outside of 
the normal range in the clinic thus far. 
In  conscious  dogs,  there  were  no  change  (p  >  0.05)  from  the  vehicle  response  in  MABP  or  HR  for  either 
tasimelteon or the melatonin treated dogs. ECG analysis showed no effect on QRS width, PR or QT interval for 
any treatment group as compared to the vehicle group 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific animal studies have been undertaken to assess potential pharmacodynamics drug interaction. 
However since tasimelteon demonstrated full agonist activity at both receptors MT1 and MT2 and no appreciable 
affinity for over 160 other pharmacologically relevant receptors, the CHMP accepted the absence of further 
studies. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon was investigated in vitro and in vivo studies with mice (CD-1), rats 
(Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Long Evans), rabbits (New Zealand white (NZW)), and monkeys (cynomolgus). 
Seven single dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats and monkeys, and four repeat-dose 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in mice, rats and rabbits. The metabolites of tasimelteon were 
determined in vitro and in vivo. A tissue distribution study was performed in rats by using [14C]-tasimelteon.  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 17/79 
 
  
  
  
 
Following single dose oral administration of tasimelteon in rats and monkeys, absorption was generally rapid, 
with maximal plasma concentration reached within 1-2 hours. Oral bioavailability was estimated at 92.8%, 
58.5% and 100% (in rats) and 11.7 ± 8.2% in monkeys. After a single i.v. dose to rats, plasma drug 
concentrations exhibited a monoexponential decline with an elimination half-life of 0.24 hour; the plasma AUC 
value was 1.84 mg•h/L; and the values of clearance and apparent volume of distribution (steady state) were 
45.2 mL/min•kg and 0.99 L/kg, respectively. The mean brain/plasma concentration ratio was 0.9 at 20 minutes. 
Dose proportional increases in AUC and Cmax were reported in mice given oral doses of active (100 to 600 
mg/kg). The levels of both parameters on Day 1 were approximately 2 to 4 times greater than those on Day 29, 
suggesting that possible hepatic enzyme induction may have occurred. Exposure increased non-proportionally 
in rats (including pregnant rats). Plasma drug concentrations in females were generally greater than those in the 
males.  Tasimelteon was moderately bound to proteins in human and animal serum and the binding was 
concentration dependent.   
Drug-related radioactivity was shown to be widely distributed to tissues in rats following a single dose. The 
highest drug concentrations were observed in the plasma, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system. The long 
half-life of radioactivity in the eyes (126 hours) and longer half-life in pigmented skin (15.4 hours) versus 
non-pigmented skin (7.6 hours) suggest binding of [14C]-tasimelteon associated activity to melanin. 
Metabolic products in human were similar to those in monkey, including 8 metabolites (H1 to H8); except for H2, 
a minor metabolite, all other metabolites were also found in the mice and rats. The most abundant metabolites 
in vivo were M9, M12, and M13, and the other main metabolites were M3, M11, and M14. M9 was identified as 
a phenol-carboxylic acid derivative of tasimelteon. M11 was proposed to be hydroxy-phenol tasimelteon and M8 
was identified as a glucuronide of M11. M12 and M14 were determined as α and β-isomers of 7-hydroxy 
tasimelteon. M13 was identified as 8-hydroxy tasimelteon and M1 was identified as 8-O-glucuronide of 
tasimelteon. Glucuronidation was the major phase II metabolic route. 
The extent and route of excretion was determined in rats and monkeys. In both species, elimination of drug 
related material was predominantly in the urine (57% - 75% and 79% - 83% in rats and monkey, respectively). 
Faecal elimination was greater in rats (~21% - 24%) than monkeys (3% - 4%). In both species elimination of 
tasimelteon was rapid, with over 90% of radioactivity recovered in rats and 86% 89% in monkeys, 24 hours 
after oral administration. Elimination was near complete in rats and monkeys by 72 and 168 hours, respectively. 
The excretion of tasimelteon into milk has not been investigated. CHMP has accepted the absence of such data 
and an adequate warning was included in the SmPC.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
The  potential  of  drug  interaction  with  tasimelteon  or  with  its  metabolites  was  investigated  in  eight  in  vitro 
studies of human enzymes and transporters; an ex vivo study was also conducted to evaluate tasimelteon as an 
inducer of liver microsomal cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase expression in rats. No in vivo 
studies  were  conducted.  Results  indicated  that  a  low  potential  for  inhibition  of  human  CYP  enzymes  at  the 
therapeutic  dose.  However,  Tasimelteon  appears  to  be  an  inducer  of  multiple  CYP450  enzymes  in  rats  and 
CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8 in humans. No induction potential by the parent or major metabolites M9. M12 and M13 
of CYP1A2 and CYP 2B6 enzymes was apparent. Furthermore there appears to be no interaction potential with 
the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 or interactions at concentrations at least 
6  times  higher  than  the  average  human  maximum  plasma  concentration  at  the  20  mg  therapeutic  dose 
suggesting  little  or  no  likelihood  of  in  vivo  inhibition.  Tasimelteon  and  its  metabolites  do  not  appear  to  be 
substrates  for  P-gp,  OATP1B1  or  OATP1B3  transporters  nor  do  they  appear  to  inhibit  the  Breast  Cancer 
Resistance Protein (BCRP), the Bile Salt Export Pump (BSEP), or P-gp.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In an acute study in mice, one male administered 1750 mg/kg died following a number of clinical signs of 
toxicity.  The 1750 mg/kg dose also was associated with tonic convulsions, hypoactivity, inappropriate 
locomotion, and ataxia shortly after dosing. In two rat studies, the highest doses of 400 and 1750 mg/kg did not 
cause mortality. Clinical signs included ptosis at ≥ 400 mg/kg, and ataxia, impaired respiration and loss of 
righting reflex at 1750 mg/kg. In a non-GLP compliant dose range finding study in cynomolgus monkeys no 
mortality was seen up to the highest dose of 200 mg/kg. Clinical signs of salivation were seen in males ≥ 50 
mg/kg, and emesis was seen in one female at 100 and 150 mg/kg. In all species, doses which produced clinical 
signs generally caused minimal decreases in food consumption and/or body weight gain. Overall, clinical signs 
were limited to highly supratherapeutic doses and the studies do not indicate tasimelteon to cause acute 
systemic toxicity.

In summary clinical signs seen across species, generally at exposures many times those achieved at the 
anticipated therapeutic dose, included laboured breathing, prostration, hypoactivity, ataxia, ptosis, tremors, 
and convulsions. Food consumption and appetite were decreased in some studies with decreased body weight 
gains, although body weight gains were increased in female rats given 500 mg/kg of tasimelteon for 6 months. 
Clinical pathology parameters affected included decreases in erythron parameters and slight changes in liver 
and kidney serum chemistry in rats and monkeys. In rats there were also increases in neutrophils, WBCs, 
reticulocytes, platelets; changes in coagulation parameters; increases in cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose; 
changes in serum electrolytes; and increased urine volume with decreases in urine specific gravity. The spleen 
was a target organ in rodents, with increased spleen weight correlating with incidence and severity of 
hemosiderosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The CHMP considered the splenic findings to be a 
compensatory effect secondary to the altered haematology parameters, and given adequate safety margins and 
the absence of clinical correlation, they were not considered a relevant clinical risk.   
Increased liver size and weights were common pathology findings in both non-clinical species used in the pivotal 
general toxicity repeat-dose studies (rats and monkeys), which was correlated with hepatocellular hypertrophy 
in the rat. In rats there was also a treatment-related increased incidence and/or severity of chronic progressive 
nephropathy. The CPN is known to be a common incidence in rats which is increased following chemical 
exposure and the safety margins from the human are sufficient (23-fold). The CHMP agreed with the Applicant 
that as the pathogenesis of CPN in rats is distinct from human nephropathy, the findings are not considered 
predictive of human toxicity.

In vitro studies concluded that tasimelteon was not mutagenic or clastogenic (Study 96742; Study 97679; Study 
97680). M11 had no mutagenic potential in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Study UNN0003), and was 
equivocally clastogenic at high concentrations in the presence of S-9 mix in an in vitro cytogenetic test (Study 
UNN0004).  
In vivo tasimelteon was not genotoxic to rat bone marrow cells at doses of up to 400 mg/kg administered for one 
month (Study 97331-52295). Toxicokinetic evaluation was performed in this study confirming adequate drug 
exposure at multiples of the expected human exposure at the proposed therapeutic dose. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two  24-month  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  potential  carcinogenicity  of  orally 
administered tasimelteon in mice and rats. The design and major findings of each study are described in table 
4.

Two-year carcinogenicity studies showed that tasimelteon was not associated with tumour development in mice. 
In rats there was a treatment related increase in hepatocellular adenoma, which was significant in males at 250 
mg/kg and females at ≥100 mg/kg. Additional non-neoplastic liver findings included centrilobular hypertrophy 
at ≥100 mg/kg, regenerative hyperplasia, cystic degeneration in males at ≥100 mg/kg, and bile duct 
hyperplasia, hepatocyte pigmentation and basophilic foci in females at ≥ 100 mg/kg. The NOEL for 
hepatocellular adenoma was 20 mg/kg, which provides a 17 fold margin of safety at the proposed clinical dose 
to 20 mg/day. Given that tasimelteon was shown to be a phenobarbitol-type inducer of CYP2B1/2 in rats in vivo, 
and in the absence of genotoxic effects, the tumourigenic effects are consistent with rodent-specific 
tumourigenicity secondary to hepatic enzyme induction.  
At 250 mg/kg there were increased incidences of uterine tumours (endometrial adenocarcinoma and squamous 
cell carcinoma) and other non-neoplastic female reproductive tract changes which suggested a species-specific 
effect of unknown etiology in aging female rats, as similar findings were not seen in the associated mouse 
carcinogenicity study (Study TAJ0002).

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies showed that oestrous cycles were prolonged in rats treated 
with high doses of tasimelteon, with no effect on mating performance or male fertility, with only a marginal 
effect on female fertility. Tasimelteon administration was not associated with malformations and did not cause 
selective embryo-fetal toxicity in rats or in rabbits. Offspring of female rats treated with high doses of 
tasimelteon had a birth weight marginally low and bodyweight significantly low by weaning; in these animals the 
mean age of achievement of surface righting and air righting was slightly higher, and these animals were 
significantly lighter than controls and showed minor changes in the timing of sexual development but with no 
effect on fertility. Taken together, these results indicate that overall tasimelteon had limited effects on 
reproductive function and embryo/fetal development at clinically relevant exposures. These results and 
precautions for use in pregnant and breast-feeding women have been reflected in appropriate sections of the 
SmPC.

Toxicokinetics groups were analyzed in all pivotal repeat-dose studies. Tasimelteon was measurable at all doses 
throughout the study period, and safety margins are calculated based on AUC values determined in a clinical 
pharmacology study.  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 27/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Given that tasimelteon treatment in rodents results in enzyme hepatic induction, there is a potential for 
alterations in the metabolite profile in long term studies. Therefore, the CHMP asked the Applicant to justify the 
absence of toxicokinetic analysis of metabolites in the pivotal toxicity studies. To address the absent data, a 
specific 4 week pharmacokinetic study was performed, and these data were used to extrapolate exposure levels 
in the chronic studies. The treatment doses chosen for the study are sufficient to cover the doses used in the 
long-term studies. The Applicant considered the metabolite profile at 4 weeks to be representative of the long 
term studies because decreased tasimelteon exposure seen at 28 days indicated hepatic induction has already 
occurred at this point, accumulation was minimal at 28 days and levels of parent drug were similar at weeks 4 
and week 26, indicating steady state was reached by 4 weeks.  
The data indicate that levels of parent drug are consistent at the end of the 4 week PK study and the chronic 
toxicity studies. The data do not provide direct evidence that the profile of metabolites, and the relative fraction 
of each metabolite, is equivalent at the end of the chronic study. However, the CHMP agreed that it is reasonable 
to assume that if significantly increased activity of enzymes involved in tasimelteon metabolism were to occur in 
the long term studies, this would be reflected by decreased levels of circulating parent drug. Moreover, since the 
safety margins for the majority of metabolites is large, the NOAEL doses would allow for small changes in the 
metabolite profile without posing a safety concern. Therefore the CHMP agreed that the absence of TK data for 
the metabolites of tasimelteon in the long term studies is acceptable. 
Local Tolerance  
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the local tolerance of tasimelteon. In a bovine corneal opacity and 
permeability assay (Study 99AB38.350); tasimelteon was classified as a mild irritant. In a skin sensitisation 
assay using guinea pigs (Study BMY 378/993273/SS), tasimelteon showed no evidence of inducing skin 
sensitivity. 
Phototoxicity 
A study was conducted to determine the molar extinction coefficient for tasimelteon and its main metabolites 
(Study VCR-TMI-121012). No other specific non-clinical photosafety testing was conducted. 
A spectroscopic scan between 290 and 700 nm has demonstrated that tasimelteon absorbs light at 290 nm 
which would trigger the need for specific photoxicity testing in accordance with ICH guidance. However, 
tasimelteon was also shown to have a Molar Extinction Coefficient (MEC) of 689.41 L/mol/cm (Study 
VCR-TMI-121012). Molecules with an MEC less than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 are deemed less of a photosafety risk 
since this low level of light absorption is unlikely to prove harmful 
Metabolites M3, M12 and M14 were reported to have MEC values that exceeded 1,000 L/mol/cm at the 
absorption wavelength of 290 nm. In the single dose distribution study (Study 178/214778/003) a long half-life 
of radioactivity in the eyes (126 hours) and longer half-life in pigmented skin (15.4 hours) versus 
non-pigmented skin (7.6 hours) was reported (suggesting binding of [14C]-tasimelteon associated activity to 
melanin).  
In the absence of specific phototoxicity studies with the metabolites, the Applicant has conducted further 
analyses and data reviews to assess this potential risk.  However, the non-clinical concern regarding the 
phototoxic potential of tasimelteon and its metabolites M3, M12 and M14 was not regarded resolved by the 
CHMP. To avoid the need for protective measures during therapeutic use of tasimelteon the phototoxic potential 
of tasimelteon and its metabolites the CHMP has recommended that this concern will be investigated as a 
Post-approval measure (PAM). 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014

Other toxicity studies 
Dependency 
The dependence studies do not indicate that tasimelteon has stimulus effects similar to the midazolam training 
cue in a drug discrimination study (Study 8260770), nor did self-administered tasimelteon act as a reinforcer 
similar to midazolam (Study 8260771). With extrapolation from oral and i.v. toxicokinetics studies in rats, the 
exposures achieved for tasimelteon and most metabolites in the abuse liability studies were at parity or 
multiples of the exposures anticipated in humans at the therapeutic dose. These results indicate a lack of 
potential for abuse liability, consistent with the selective receptor binding profile of tasimelteon. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  has  submitted  an  ERA  based  on  the  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  guideline.  Tasimelteon  PEC 
surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 
4.5. Therefore tasimelteon is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The log Kow value was determined in a study, which was in line with OECD 107, by the flask shake method.    
Based on the data presented below, both Log Kow and PEC values indicate that bioaccumulation in the food of 
aquatic  organisms  is  unlikely,  and  that  the  use  of  tasimelteon  is  well  below  the  PEC  risk  threshold  value. 
Therefore, the CHMP was of the opinion that the use of tasimelteon for the treatment of Non-24 in totally blind 
persons is unlikely to have a significant impact on the environment and no Phase II Environmental Fate and 
Effects Analyses are warranted.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Results from a series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies support the rationale for the development of 
tasimelteon for the proposed indication due to the highly specific receptor interaction with only human MT1 and 
MT2 and chronobiotic effects demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo.  
The potential for hERG inhibition by the major metabolites of tasimelteon has not been investigated. The 
applicant explained that there was no appreciable affinity for the hERG ion channel by the major metabolites. 
The CHMP agreed that the absence of affinity for this channel in vitro supports the decision to not conduct 
specific studies. Further reassurance was provided by in vivo animal and human data. In particular, there was a 
lack of electrocardiographic findings in the One-Year Oral Toxicity Study in monkeys, where toxicokinetic 
analyses demonstrated significant clinical safety margins at the highest dose tested for human metabolites M9, 
M12, and M13. Furthermore there has been no significant cardiac safety signals in the clinical programme; 
including the thorough QTc study where dose levels up to 300 mg have been administered allowing exposure 
levels of major metabolites up to 15x the Cmax levels expected at the proposed therapeutic dose. 
The absence of a GLP-compliant in vivo cardiovascular safety study in line with ICH 7A was justified by the fact 
that this study was performed prior to the publication of ICH 7A, and was therefore in line with regulatory 
requirements at the time. Although the study was not GLP-compliant, the CHMP was of the opinion that the 
study was performed adequately and the conclusions of the study are reliable. 
With the exception of studies on the cardiovascular system, no other specific non-clinical safety pharmacology 
studies were conducted. To justify the absence of respiratory and CNS safety pharmacology studies, the 
applicant has outlined the clinical safety profile with respect to both organ systems. In 23 clinical studies there 
were no adverse respiratory events. CNS effects have been established clinically following treatment in ~1000 
patients for CNS indications. Effects included psychomotor effects, suicidality, dizziness and withdrawal 
symptoms. Given the well-established clinical safety profile in respiratory and CNS systems, the CHMP has 
agreed that further non-clinical safety studies would not significantly add to the safety information for 
tasimelteon, and their absence was acceptable.  
In the absence of specific phototoxicity studies with the metabolites, the Applicant has conducted further 
analyses and data reviews to assess this potential risk.  However, the non-clinical concern regarding the 
phototoxic potential of tasimelteon and its metabolites M3, M12 and M14 is not regarded resolved by the CHMP 
for the following reasons: 
1.) 
The Applicant attributes the long half-life of tasimelteon, which was determined in the eyes and skin of 
rats after single drug administration (mass-balance study 178/214778/003), to an incorrect overestimation due 
to the limited animal numbers. The Applicant disregarded the possibility that low animal numbers might even 
lead to an underestimation of the actual half-life. In fact, the unchanged concentration of tasimelteon at the 72 
h and 168 h time points indicates drug accumulation and the limited data set does not allow to conclude, if 
accumulation of tasimelteon is 2.5-fold, 8-fold or even higher. Hence, it remains the responsibility of the 
Applicant to clarify these equivocal results by an adequately performed repeated-dose pharmacokinetic study as 
noted earlier in this procedure and in the current OC by reference to the pertinent ICH S3B requirements 
(CPMP/ICH/385/95). 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 30/79 
 
  
  
  
2.) 
The assumption of the Applicant that the ratio of tasimelteon and its metabolites, which was determined 
after repeated administration in plasma, will remain the same in tissues is purely hypothetical and not 
substantiated by appropriate experimental data. Consequently, this hypothesis is rejected for the human risk 
assessment and drug accumulation in eyes and skin must be expected. 
3.) 
The absence of adverse ocular and skin events in long-term repeated-dose toxicity studies is not 
reassuring to exclude any human risk during therapeutic use, because the artificial light conditions in animal 
facilities do neither cover exposure and intensity in the range of natural sunlight irrespective of a 12 h light/dark 
cycle (see Hayes. Principles and Methods of Toxicology; 5th ed. 2008; Informa Healthcare Inc., USA: 
1070-1071), nor at the maximum absorption of tasimelteon (290 nm). Likewise, the light conditions in clinical 
trial facilities do not reflect natural sunlight exposure. Therefore, ICH guidelines do not recommend the 
evaluation of the phototoxic potential of a compound as part of standard toxicity studies, but in dedicated 
investigations. 
4.) 
The possibility of drug elimination during the normal life-cycle of keratinocytes is regarded irrelevant to 
exclude a phototoxic hazard, because this argument does not apply to the eyes and would instead abrogate any 
phototoxicity testing independent of the tiered approach outlined in the prevailing ICH S10 guideline. 
In conclusion, unless negated by further experimental data, tasimelteon is regarded to fulfil the general criteria 
of the ICH S10 guideline, that necessitate further evaluation of its phototoxic potential. In order to resolve this 
concern and to avoid the need for protective measures during therapeutic use of tasimelteon, a repetition of the 
MEC value determination and a repeated-dose pharmacokinetic study to determine the distribution of 
tasimelteon and its metabolites to light-exposed tissues was deemed necessary as PAM.  
Tasimelteon  was  not  genotoxic  in  the  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies  in  line  with  ICH  S2B.  The 
metabolite M11 was negative in the Ames test but in the mammalian assay increased the number of aberrant 
chromosomes at high doses of ≥ 1,500 µg/mL, in the presence of S-9. This concentration is roughly 30,000 fold 
greater than the expected clinical Cmax at 20 mg/day. Metabolite M11 was also shown to be a metabolite in 
mouse, so it can be assumed that mice were exposed to M11 in the in vivo genotoxicity assay. Thus, given the 
very  high  concentration  in  the  in  vitro  assay,  and  the  absence  of  increased  multinucleated  polychromatic 
erythrocytes in the in vivo assay, the metabolite M11 is not considered to present a genotoxic risk. 
The applicant has provided a detailed discussion of the maternal and foetal findings in the rabbit EFD study. The 
increased embryo-foetal loss occurred at maternal doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which was maternally toxic. There 
was sufficient justification to show that the abortive effect is secondary to maternal toxicity, therefore the 
applicant’s conclusion was supported by the CHMP. Considering the large margin of safety from the 200 mg/kg 
dose in rabbits, and the absence of foetal loss at non-maternally toxic doses, the CHMP agreed that these 
findings do not present a specific clinical safety concern to pregnancy. 
The applicant asserted that the delayed ossification observed in this study was linked to foetal growth rates, and 
was not indicative of a permanent teratogenic effect. The delay in ossification was not considered to persist in 
the post-natal period. As post-natal development was not studied in rabbits, the recovery cannot be determined, 
and the mechanism underlying the finding was not elucidated. However the CHMP accepted that delayed 
ossification is a common finding, and given that the finding only occurred at the 200 mg/kg tasimelteon dose, 
the risk to the foetus can be considered in the context of the large safety margin from the clinical dose. Therefore 
the risk of delayed ossification occurring clinically is negligible.  
The absence of antigenicity testing was justified by the Applicant, stating that antigenicity studies are typically 
conducted for biotechnology derived products. As tasimelteon is a small molecule, there were no findings in the 
toxicology studies to warrant specific studies, and there was no evidence of antigenic responses in the clinical 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 31/79 
 
  
  
  
safety database, specific antigenicity studies were not deemed necessary. This justification was accepted by the 
CHMP. 
No immunotoxicity studies have been conducted. This is supported by the CHMP since the data (haematology, 
clinical chemistry, gross pathology, organ weights and histology) generated from the numerous repeat dose 
toxicity studies both in rat and monkey demonstrate no evidence that the immune system was a target organ of 
toxicity of tasimelteon. 
Studies conducted to determine local tolerance and dependence potential did not identify any relevant toxicities. 
The dependence studies were not GLP-complaint as required by guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004. 
However, as they were of a sufficient standard in terms of design, execution and data control,  the CHMP did not 
consider the lack of GLP-compliance to impact the findings of the studies.  
Finally, there are no issues in relation to the impurity profile of the drug substance or drug product from a 
non-clinical perspective.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion the non-clinical data provided were considered sufficient, together with additional measure as 
specified earlier, to support this dossier.

The tasimelteon development program included fourteen phase I clinical pharmacology studies. 
Absorption  
Tasimelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentration (Tmax) occurring at approximately 0.5 hours 
after fasted oral administration. Total oral absorption of tasimelteon is at least 80.4% and the mean absolute 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 34/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bioavailability is 38%. In study VP-VEC-162-1102 administration of tasimelteon with a high fat/high calorie meal 
resulted in a reduction of Cmax by 44%. The median Tmax increased from 0.75 hours under fasted conditions 
to 2.5 hours under fed conditions. AUC (0-t) and AUC (inf) were comparable under fed and fasted conditions, 
108.57% and 106.54%, respectively, and 90% confidence intervals contained within the 80% to 125% 
equivalence window.  
Based on these results it has been recommended in the SmPC that tasimelteon should be administered without 
food.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state of tasimelteon in young healthy subjects ranged from 58.5 
to  125.9  litres.    At  therapeutic  concentrations,  tasimelteon  is  about  88.6  -  90.1%  protein  bound.  Renal 
impairment does not affect the protein binding of tasimelteon. 
Elimination 
Tasimelteon is extensively metabolised.  Following oral administration of radiolabeled tasimelteon, <1% of the 
unchanged  parent  drug  was  detectable  in  the  urine.    The  main  route  of  elimination  of  tasimelteon  and  its 
metabolites in humans is through the kidney, with biliary excretion to feces contributing for a minor portion.  
Mean recovery of total radioactivity in urine was 80.4% and 3.72% was recovered in feces resulting in a mean 
recovery of 84.1% (Study 1101). 
Metabolism 
When  administered  orally,  tasimelteon  undergoes  a  rapid  metabolism  through  the  CYP450  system  at  the 
gastrointestinal level and in the liver. Eight metabolites have been characterized — M1, M3, M8, M9, M11, M12, 
M13, and M14. All were present in plasma and M1, M3, M8, and M9 were present in urine.  
Metabolism of tasimelteon consists primarily of oxidation at multiple sites and oxidative dealkylation resulting in 
opening of the dihydrofuran ring followed by further oxidation to give a carboxylic acid. From in vitro studies it 
was found that tasimelteon is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, with minimal contribution from 
CYP1A1, CYP2C9/19, and CYP2D6, however the in vivo contribution of various enzyme pathways is uncertain, 
particularly the relative importance of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. 
Phenolic glucuronidation is the major phase II metabolic route.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
The dose proportionality of tasimelteon following a single oral dose between 1-300 mg was evaluated in healthy 
volunteers  (BMS  Study  001).  Following  a  single  1-,  3-,  10-,  30-,  100-,  300-  mg  dose  of  tasimelteon,  the 
estimated  geometric  means 
ratios, 
1:1.5:7.9:13.5:66.9:210.5 suggesting an increase less than proportionally to dose. Excluding the 1 mg dose, 
the  geometric  means  for  AUC(inf)  were  in  the  following  ratios:  1:5.3:9.1:45.0:141.5  suggesting  dose 
proportionality and linearity over the dose range of 3- to 300-mg.

Study VEC-162-1110 evaluated the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon and main metabolites (M9, 
M11, M12, M13, and M14), including the time to steady-state, during administration of 20 mg once daily for 16 
days  (Study  Days  5-20)  in  twenty-four  (24)  healthy  male  and  female  subjects.  The  pharmacokinetics  of 
tasimelteon did not change with continued daily dosing. This was also true for tasimelteon metabolites. 
Special populations 
Mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  resulted  in  minimal  increases  in  exposure  at  a  dose  of  20  mg  —  
approximately  2-fold  for  the  parent,  less  for  the  metabolites.  Tasimelteon  was  not  studied  in  patients  with 
severe hepatic impairment.  
Exposure to tasimelteon in subjects with severe renal impairment (SRI) or end stage renal disease (ESRD) had 
inconsistent results after a single dose of 20 mg.  Compared to matched controls, SRI patients had, on average, 
a lower CL/F with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 70.52%.  In contrast, ESRD patients, had a comparable 
arithmetic mean CL/F with a GMR of 97.82%, and comparable mean plasma concentrations and arithmetic mean 
values for Cmax and AUC(inf). 
Population PK analyses was conducted for four studies (Study 1105, Study 1106, Study 1107, and Study 1110) 
with orally administered tasimelteon to evaluate the effect of gender on the PK profile of tasimelteon. In this 
analysis, gender did not affect the apparent clearance of tasimelteon.  Similarly, race and ethnicity were not 
found to affect the apparent clearance of tasimelteon in any of the analyses done. 
From the Population PK analysis results, elderly subjects had an apparent clearance of 20% less than young 
adults. In contrast, study 1107 didn’t show any difference. CHMP agreed that this discrepancy is related to the 
overall  variability  of  Tasimelteon  PK  more  than  the  age.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  in  the  elderly  is 
recommended in the SmPC.  
Two independent analyses, a multivariate statistical analysis of PK parameters based on non-compartmental 
analysis  and  a  compartmental  model-based  population  PK  analysis,  concluded  that  increasing  BMI  was 
associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  apparent  clearance  of  tasimelteon  whereas  no  other  metric  of  body  size 
affected apparent clearance. This effect is probably due to the known decrease in CYP1A2 activity with increased 
BMI. Due to the overall inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, contributions to this variability by these factors, 
if  present,  were  judged  to  be  not  clinically  meaningful.    Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  has  been  found 
necessary based on BMI.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of tasimelteon on other drugs 
In vitro data suggested that tasimelteon had the potential to induce the activity of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8. This 
was examined in 2 clinical studies, Study 1104 and Study 1110, in which a single 10 mg oral dose of midazolam 
(a CYP3A4 substrate) was administered alone and then after tasimelteon 100 mg QD × 7 days and 20 mg QD 
× 14 days, respectively. Additionally, Study 1110 investigated the effect of  tasimelteon on a single dose of 
rosiglitazone  (a  CYP2C8  substrate)  given  concomitantly  after  tasimelteon  20  mg  ×  16  days.  The  mean  PK 
parameters for midazolam and 1-OH-midazolam (major metabolite of midazolam) after administration alone 
were comparable between the two studies suggesting consistency between the 2 studies with respect to the 2 
probe drugs. Administration of tasimelteon 100 mg once daily for 7 days resulted in a trend toward a decrease 
in  the  exposure  to  midazolam  that  was  not  statistically  significant.  While  there  was  also  a  trend  toward  a 
decrease in midazolam exposure after administration of 20 mg once daily for 14 days the difference was again 
not statistically significant. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 36/79 
 
  
  
  
The mean values for Cmax, AUC (0-t), and AUC(inf) of midazolam, 1-OH-midazolam, and rosiglitazone were 
comparable when given alone or in combination with tasimelteon after multiple dosing. Tasimelteon therefore 
does not appear to have the potential for in vivo induction of either CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C8. 
Effects of other drugs on tasimelteon 
The results of drug-drug interactions studies are summarised in the Table 10 below.  
Table 10 Impact of other drugs on tasimelteon pharmacokinetics 
Consistent with the major role of CYP1A2 in the metabolism of tasimelteon, administration of fluvoxamine and 
the subsequent inhibition of CYP1A2, and CYP2C19 resulted in a decrease in the mean CL/F and an increase in 
exposure  as  measured  by  AUC(inf)  with  a  geometric  mean  ratio  (GMR)  of  653.36%  (90%  CI:  527.12%  to 
809.82%).  Conversely,  induction  of  CYP1A2  by  cigarette  smoking  increased  the  mean  CL/F  compared  to 
non-smokers  with  a  GMR,  smokers-to-non-smokers,  of  166.27%  (90%  CI:  119.87%  to  230.64%). 
Administration of ketoconazole and the subsequent inhibition of CYP3A4 resulted in a decrease in the mean CL/F 
with a GMR, tasimelteon alone-to-tasimelteon + ketoconazole, of 64.95% (90% CI: 58.12% to 72.60%) (Table 
16). The decrease in CL/F resulted in an increase in exposure as measured by AUC(inf) with a GMR of 153.95% 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 37/79 
 
  
  
  
 
(90%  CI:  137.75%  to  172.07%).  Conversely,  administration  of  rifampin  and  the  subsequent  induction  of 
CYP3A4,CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 resulted in substantial increases in the mean CL/F, with a GMR, tasimelteon 
alone-to-tasimelteon + rifampin, of 930.50% (90% CI: 723.47% to 1,196.77%). The increase in CL/F resulted 
in a decrease in exposure as measured by AUC(inf) with a GMR of 10.75% (90% CI:8.36% to 13.82%)  
Administration of tasimelteon 20 mg QD for 16 days did not produce any clinically significant changes in the 
Tmax, Cmax, or AUC of rosiglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) after oral administration of 4 mg. This indicates that 
there is no induction of CYP2C8 by tasimelteon at this dose.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
A preliminary in vitro study (Study BMS-10Nov97) was conducted to determine whether tasimelteon can be 
metabolized  by  specific  cDNA-derived  cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes.  The  CYP450-mediated  metabolism  of 
tasimelteon  was  then  investigated  in  human  liver  microsomes  (Study  XBL08639)  and  in  recombinant  CYP 
enzyme systems (Study XBL08639), by monitoring the formation of five main metabolites (M9, M11, M12, M13, 
and M14) with and without selective CYP450 chemical inhibitors.  CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are the major isozymes 
involved in the metabolism of tasimelteon.  CYP1A1, CYP2C9/19, and CYP2D6 also minimally contribute to the 
metabolism of tasimelteon.  
Tasimelteon and Metabolites as Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors 
The potential for tasimelteon and its most abundant human metabolites (M9, M12 and M13) to inhibit, in vitro, 
the major CYP enzymes in human liver microsomes — CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 
and  CYP3A4/5  was  investigated  in  Study  XT12A024,  Study  XT065016  and  Study  XT135015.    Based  on  the 
results of these studies tasimelteon and its most abundant metabolites are unlikely to cause clinically relevant 
inhibition of any of the major CYPs in humans (i.e., CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 3A4/5) at the therapeutic 
dose.  
Tasimelteon and Metabolites as Cytochrome P450 Inducers 
The  effect  of  treating  primary  cultures  of  human  hepatocytes  with  tasimelteon  on  the  mRNA  expression  of 
several microsomal CYP450 enzymes — CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5— was investigated 
in vitro in Study XT063014.  The data from this study suggested that tasimelteon had the potential to induce the 
activity of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8.   
The effects of treating cultured human hepatocytes with tasimelteon and its most abundant metabolites, M9, 
M12, and M13, on the expression of CYP1A2 and 2B6 enzymes were investigated in vitro in Study XT123078.  In 
this study, the ability of tasimelteon’s most abundant metabolites to induce CYP1A2 in vitro was also evaluated. 
Results showed that neither tasimelteon nor its most abundant metabolites appear to induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6, 
except at high concentrations well above the average human maximum plasma concentrations at the 20 mg 
therapeutic dose . 
Tasimelteon and Metabolites as Transporter Inhibitors or Substrates 
Tasimelteon  and  its  most  abundant  metabolites  showed  either  no  interaction  potential  with  the  uptake 
transporters  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OCT2,  OAT1,  and  OAT3  or  interactions  at  concentrations  at  least  6  times 
higher than the average human maximum plasma concentration at the 20 mg therapeutic dose suggesting little 
or no likelihood of in vivo inhibition.  Tasimelteon and its metabolites do not appear to be substrates for P-gp, 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 transporters nor do they appear to inhibit BCRP, BSEP, or P-gp (Study 10VNDAP1R1, 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 38/79 
 
  
  
  
Solvo  12700,  and  XT138089).  Therefore,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  further  evaluation  of  the  potential  for 
tasimelteon to interact with these transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3) 
is not warranted. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tasimelteon is a circadian regulator that resets the master body clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of 
the hypothalamus. This activity is believed to be mediated by the affinity of tasimelteon to the MT1 and MT2 
receptors in the SCN. Tasimelteon main metabolites (i.e. M3, M9, M11, M12, M13 and M14) also bind to the 
melatonin receptors but with less affinity than the parent. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology  
The results of the Proof of Concept study (VP-VEC-162-2101) showed that tasimelteon induced a forward shift 
in DLMO25% and LOQ5 on the first night of treatment. Disruption of sleep efficiency, REM polarity and wake 
after sleep onset (WASO) caused by phase advance also improved. 
Study  CN116-001  studied  the  safety,  tolerance,  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamics  of  single  doses  of 
tasimelteon  in  healthy  subjects  whilst  study  CN116-002  was  conducted  to  study  the  safety,  tolerance, 
pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  multiple  doses  of  tasimelteon  in  healthy  subjects.  The  results 
suggested that tasimelteon has some sleep promoting effect without affecting daytime functioning. No change 
was noted in the psychometric variables between the treatment and placebo group.  
Study VP-VEC-162-1108 studied the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics interactions of tasimelteon and 
ethanol. With the exceptions of visual-motor –processing speed (number of symbols completed within a given 
time  on  the  DSST,  administration  of  tasimelteon  alone  did  not  have  any  significant  effects  on  subjective 
measures,  sustained  attention,  cognition,  balance,  or  psychomotor  performance.  The  combination  of 
Tasimelteon + ethanol did no significantly differ from ethanol alone. 
The results of the QTc study 1103 demonstrated that tasimelteon has no potential to affect cardiac 
repolarization. No effects were recorded on heart rate, PR or QRS interval duration or cardiac morphology. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  characteristics  of  tasimelteon  are  highly  variable  amongst  individuals.  Intrinsic  factors  that  might 
influence  the  PK  variability  of  tasimelteon  include  age,  gender,  and  body  composition.  Due  to  the  overall 
inter-subject variability of tasimelteon, contributions to this variability by these factors, if present, are probably 
small and not clinically meaningful. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary based on age, gender, or body 
max index. 
Mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  resulted  in  minimal  increases  in  exposure  at  a  dose  of  20  mg  — 
approximately 2-fold for the parent, less for the metabolites.  Based on the observed inter-subject variability in 
the PK parameter of tasimelteon and taking into account the therapeutic margin of tasimelteon (i.e., doses up 
to at least 300 mg are well tolerated),  the CHMP was of the opinion this increased exposure is not clinically 
relevant  and  dose  adjustment  is  not  necessary  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 39/79 
 
  
  
  
Tasimelteon has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) therefore 
caution was recommended when prescribing it to patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
The inconsistent results of renal impairment study have been judged to be related to the intrinsic variability. 
Considering the overall favourable safety and tolerability profile of tasimelteon (i.e. doses up to at least 300 mg 
are well tolerated, and nonclinical data showed that chronic dosing of tasimelteon did not result in any relevant 
toxicological findings at the expected therapeutic dose), no dose adjustment was deemed necessary for these 
special populations. 
Theoretically, the tasimelteon pharmacokinetics of healthy subjects should be similar to that of Non-24 patients 
as Non-24 patients have interrupted biorhythms but typically do not present with any other particular variables 
that  would  affect  the  overall  PK  differences  seen  in  healthy  subjects.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the 
pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon would be expected to  be similar between  Non-24 patients and  the healthy 
subjects. 
The exposures to tasimelteon and its main metabolites are affected by the induction of CYP1A2 (e.g. smoking) 
and/ or CYP3A4 and other CYPs. Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C19/2C9 inducer with little/no 
effect on CYP1A2, reduced the exposure to tasimelteon by approximately 90% (Study 1112). Therefore, the 
concomitant use of rifampin and other strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C19/2C9 inducers with tasimelteon 
should be avoided. 
Co-administration with fluvoxamine, which inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2C9/19, resulted in an 85% decrease in 
tasimelteon clearance leading to a 6.5-fold increase in exposure.  Similarly, tasimelteon exposure increased by 
approximately 54% when given concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole.   
While  it was claimed by the applicant that CYP1A2 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of 
tasimelteon, this was inconsistent with the results of the rifampin interaction study; the effect was much larger 
than could be explained by induction of CYP3A4, representing only 30% of drug elimination.  As CYP1A2 is not 
induced by rifampin, there is uncertainty regarding the quantitative importance of CYP2C19 and 1A2 in vivo.  
While it is accepted that the maximum extent of interaction has been defined (6.5-fold increase in AUC), lower, 
but still important exposure increases cannot be ruled out without clarification of the relative contributions of 
CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.  Therefore, the CHMP requested additional in vitro and in vivo studies in order to mitigate 
the risk of drug-drug interactions. These studies will be conducted as post-approval measures. Appropriate 
wording advising caution has been included in the SmPC, until this uncertainty is resolved with additional study 
data.  
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A number of uncertainties have been identified by the CHMP regarding unanticipated drug-drug interactions due 
to inadequate understanding of the quantitative contribution of the enzymes responsible for the elimination of 
tasimelteon. These issues are to be investigated post approval.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
1.  The applicant should perform in vitro investigations of which enzymes are catalysing the main elimination 
pathways using incubations of the drug with: 1) human liver microsomes with and without enzyme specific 
inhibitors/antibodies and 2) recombinant CYP enzymes.  Both studies should be conducted according to the 
current Guideline on the Investigations of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1), using clinically 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 40/79 
 
  
  
  
relevant concentrations under linear conditions and monitoring metabolite formation.  The applicant should 
submit the study protocol for review prior to study start. 
2.  The applicant should provide a pooled analysis of all genotype data collected during the phase 1 study 
programme and relationship to apparent drug clearance.  In addition, the Company should add a series of 
columns to the table in 2.7.6 Synopses of Individual Studies: including one column for genotypes 
investigated and a second column to highlight any reasons why the genotype data could not be investigated 
retrospectively.  In addition, the applicant should submit a plan for retrospective analysis of 2C19 and other 
genotypes of phase 1 study samples or provide a justification as to why this information cannot be obtained 
or is unnecessary. 
3.  Unless otherwise justified, the applicant should conduct a retrospective analysis of phase 1 study samples to 
determine 2C19 and other genotypes and conduct an analysis of relationship to apparent drug clearance, 
pooling data across studies.  
4.  Depending on the results of the additional in vitro studies and additional in vivo data/analyses, the applicant 
should perform additional in vivo studies such as (1) a new study of tasimelteon in extensive and poor 
CYP2C19 metabolisers, (2) a new PK study of tasimelteon that includes markers of CYP1A2, 3A4 and 2C19 
metabolism, (3) a new DDI study with a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor, such as fluconazole and/or (4) any other 
approach deemed to be informative.  The applicant should submit the study protocol(s) for review prior to 
study start or provide a justification as to why additional in vivo studies are unnecessary. Once the study 
programme is complete (even in the case that no new in vivo study is conducted), the applicant should 
provide an updated mass balance scheme that shows clearly the quantitative importance of different 
enzymatic pathways according to the cumulative excretion of all entities following a particular pathway and 
integrating the data derived from the recently conducted absolute bioavailability study.  
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The clinical development of tasimelteon included 2 dose-finding clinical studies (VP-VEC-162-2101 and 
VP-VEC-162-3101) and 2 pivotal efficacy trials (VP-VEC-162-3201 (SET) and VP-VEC-162-3203 (RESET).  
2.7.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection of 20 mg as the dose used in the phase III clinical studies was based on two dose-finding clinical 
studies and supported by the non-clinical . 
Study VP-VEC-162-2101 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, in-patient study in a light 
controlled time isolation sleep facility that assessed the safety and efficacy of four oral doses of tasimelteon 
(10-, 20-, 50-, and 100 mg) compared to placebo. Subject’s sleep schedule was abruptly advanced by 5 hours, 
a protocol which severely disrupts circadian rhythms including those of melatonin and the sleep-wake cycle. 
Circadian rhythms, sleep parameters, and subject alertness were assessed during an 8-day inpatient stay.  
When compared to placebo, patients treated with Tasimelteon showed a phase advance shift in the secretion of 
endogenous  melatonin  on  the  first  night  of  treatment  when  compared  to  baseline.  The  effect  on  melatonin 
secretion as measured by Dim Light Melatonin Onset-DLMO was dose-dependent  (placebo=0.48+- 0.84 hours, 
tasimelteon 10mg=0.18+-2.48 hours, tasimelteon 20mg=-1.14+-0.46hours; tasimelteon 50mg=-0.50+-0.32 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 41/79 
 
  
  
  
hours, tasimelteon 100mg=-2.74-+1.95 hours). Tasimelteon was also able to reduce the disruption in full night 
sleep efficiency in a dose-related manner. The 20mg dose was the minimum dose that separated from placebo. 
Study VP-VEC-162-3101 was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
to investigate the efficacy and safety of single oral doses of tasimelteon (20, 50, and 100 mg) and matching 
placebo in healthy male and female subjects with induced transient insomnia. Transient insomnia was induced 
via a combination of stress inducement (by first night in a sleep laboratory) and via circadian rhythm disruption 
(by a 5-hour bedtime advance).  
This study showed significant improvement in both objective latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and wake after 
sleep onset (WASO) at 20 mg and 50mg of tasimelteon.  
The CHMP agreed with the selection of the 20mg for the main studies.  
2.7.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy of tasimelteon in the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder in totally blind individuals was 
investigated in two randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trials 
(VP-VEC-162-3201 (SET) and VP-VEC-162-3203 (RESET).  VP-VEC-162 3202 was an open-label safety study.  
The diagrammatic overview of the Phase 3 studies is presented in the Figure below.  
Introduction 
An individual who is entrained to the 24-hour  day/night  has a circadian period of 24.0  hours. Patients with 
Non-24 have circadian periods greater than 24.0 hours or in very rare cases less than 24.0 hours.   
The time taken to complete one cycle of a circadian rhythm is defined as the circadian period (τ). A fixed point 
within  a  single  cycle  is  termed  the  phase  and  is  usually  measured  from  the  peak  (maximum)  or  trough 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 42/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
(minimum) of the rhythm. The peak of a rhythm is fitted using a sine function is termed the acrophase. The 
circadian period is therefore defined as the duration of time between one phase and the next.   
In the pivotal studies, the measurement of urinary melatonin metabolite, aMT6s has been used as a circadian 
marker for patients in the home environment.  
The circadian period was used as an inclusion criterion for participation in SET and RESET and was also the 
measure for the primary endpoints (entrained or not entrained) in both studies. 
Table 11:  Definitions of Entrained and Not Entrained  
VP-VEC-162-3201  (SET):  Multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked,  placebo-controlled,  parallel 
study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  20mg  of  tasimelteon  versus  placebo  in 
patients suffering from Non-24. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Adult male and female patients in good physical health with non-entrained circadian rhythms (circadian period 
(τ) length of ≥ 24.25 hours and the lower bound of 95% CI > 24.0 hours and the upper bound of 95% CI < 24.9 
hours) were eligible for inclusion in this study. Subjects had to have no perception of light and diagnosis of 
non-24 determined by history and urinary aMT6s demonstrated by a progressive delay of the aMT6s acrophase 
time. Subjects could not be pregnant, nursing, or planning pregnancy within the projected duration of the study. 
Subjects of reproductive potential had to agree to remain abstinent or use two acceptable methods of birth 
control during the study.  
Subjects could not have had a probable diagnosis of a current sleep disorder other than Non-24 that was the 
primary cause of the sleep disturbance and history (within the 12 months prior to screening) of uncontrolled 
psychiatric disorders. Subjects who took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) daily and would not 
interrupt their use for the 48-hour urine collections were also excluded.  
Patients who had a τ >24.0 and met all entry criteria but that were ineligible for the Randomization Phase due 
to their τ value were given the opportunity to participate in the Open-Label Extension Phase. During this phase, 
patients received open-label 20 mg tasimelteon for 26 weeks. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 43/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to receive placebo or tasimelteon 20 mg every night for 6 months of treatment.  
Entrainment of urinary aMT6s and cortisol was assessed via a series of urinary measurements during screening 
and post-randomization during month 1 and for a subset of patients at month 7 (during the run-in for RESET 
study). 
For  maximum  efficacy,  the  applicant  hypothesized  that  the  time  of  maximum  plasma  concentration  of 
tasimelteon should coincide with the time that subjects go to bed. The peak Cmax of tasimelteon is reached at 
.25 to 2 hours consequently; the patients were instructed to take  the study medication 60 minutes  prior to 
bedtime. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of tasimelteon in patients with Non-24 as 
measured by the proportion of entrainment. A step-down objective was to determine the efficacy of tasimelteon 
in patients with Non-24 as measured by the proportion of patients with a clinical response. 
Clinical response was defined as the coincident demonstration of: 
             1. Entrainment of the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) rhythm and 
             2. A score of ≥3 on the Non-24 Clinical Response Scale (N24CRS). 
The key secondary objectives were the following: 
1.  To  determine  the  efficacy  of  tasimelteon  in  patients  with  Non-24  as  measured  by  the  proportion  of 
responders  with  a  combined  sleep/wake  response  for  night-time  sleep  duration  and  daytime  sleep 
duration defined as: 
a)  Increase of 90 minutes or greater in the lower quartile of nights of subjective night time total sleep 
time (LQ-nTST) and 
b)  Decrease of 90 minutes or greater in the upper quartile of days of subjective day time sleep duration 
(UQ-dTSD). 
2.  To  determine  the  efficacy  of  tasimelteon  in  patients  with  Non-24  as  measured  by  the  proportion  of 
entrainment as assessed by urinary cortisol. 
N24CRS is a 4-item scale that includes Lower Quartile of Night-time Total Sleep Time (LQ-nTST),  Upper Quartile 
of Day time Total Sleep Duration (UQ-dTSD),  Midpoint of Sleep Timing (MoST) and Clinical Global Impression of 
Change (CGI-C) assessments. Each assessment on the scale is scored as a 1 or 0 depending on whether the 
pre-specified threshold is achieved or not, as defined in Table 12. The score for each assessment is summed with 
a range of 0-4. The thresholds for each of the four parameters that make up the N24CRS are clinically 
meaningful (e.g. 45 minute improvements).  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014

Table 12: Non-24 Clinical Response Scale Components 
Night-time Total Sleep Time (nTST) 
Patients were instructed to report all sleep that occurred during the 10-hour interval between their scheduled 
nightly dosing until their predefined wake-time as nTST. The patients were instructed to call the Interactive 
Voice Recording System (IVRS) and answer the Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) questions no later than 1 hour 
after their scheduled awakening. The measure of nTST is a subjective patient-reported outcome and a 
well-accepted measure of total night-time sleep. 
Lower Quartile of nTST (LQ-nTST) 
LQ-nTST enriches for the worst night analysis reflective of the cyclical nature of Non-24. LQnTST is highly 
correlated with circadian phase, and is clinically meaningful as it is a direct reflection of the amount of night-time 
sleep when patients are suffering the most. Patients suffering from Non-24 may have trouble sleeping as a result 
of their circadian sleep cycle being out of synchrony with the 24-hour clock. This misalignment generally leads 
to intervals of poor sleep followed by intervals of good sleep. 
Day time Total Sleep Duration (dTSD) 
The Pre-Sleep Questionnaire (Pre-SQ) was used in SET and RESET to assess the number of daytime sleep 
episodes and the total amount of daytime sleep duration (dTSD). Daytime sleep was defined as any sleep event 
that lasted for > 5 minutes and that occurred after their predefined wake-time and prior to the patient’s 
scheduled dosing time. Patients were instructed to call the IVRS in the evening no later than 15 minutes after 
their daily dosing time to report all of the day time sleep that occurred that day. 
Upper Quartile of dTSD (UQ-dTSD) 
UQ-dTSD enriches for the worst day analysis reflective of the cyclical nature of Non-24.  UQ-dTSD is highly 
correlated with circadian phase and it is clinically meaningful as it is a direct reflection of the amount of daytime 
sleep when patients are suffering the most. During the periods when Non-24 patients’ circadian rhythms are 
out-of-phase with the 24-hour light-dark cycle, the patient may experience a very strong circadian drive to sleep 
during the day regardless of the amount of sleep they had the night before. During other phases the patient may 
not experience daytime sleep episodes at all. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 45/79 
 
  
  
  
 
Midpoint of Sleep Timing (MoST) 
Non-24 patients frequently present with complaints of sleep timing problems (e.g. trouble sleeping at night and 
excessive daytime sleepiness and daytime sleeping). Non-24 patients typically get the same amount of sleep on 
average every day; it may just be displaced on days when they are out-of-phase compared to days when they 
are in-phase. 
While LQ-nTST and UQ-dTSD measure daytime and night-time sleep separately, MoST measures the average 
weighted midpoint of sleep reflecting both the timing and consolidation of sleep over a 24-hour period. MoST 
endpoint measures the average timing of sleep relative to an individual’s desired period of night-time sleep 
over at least one circadian period. MoST measurement for a calendar day was derived from the Total Sleep Time 
(TST) for the 24-hour day reported in both the Pre-SQ and PSQ. The midpoint of sleep over a calendar day (from 
-12 hours before designated bedtime until +12 hours after bedtime) was calculated for each day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were the following: 
• 
The entrainment of the circadian melatonin rhythm as measured by urinary aMT6s 
and 
• 
(a step-down endpoint): The Clinical Response rate corresponding to individuals who had both: 
1. Entrainment of the aMT6s rhythm and 
2. A score of ≥3 on the N24CRS. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 46/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were the following: 
• 
The proportion of responders with a combined sleep/wake response for nighttime sleep duration and 
daytime sleep duration defined as: 
1. Increase of 90 minutes or greater in LQ-nTST and 
2. Decrease of 90 minutes or greater in UQ-dTSD. 
• 
The entrainment of the circadian rhythm as measured by urinary cortisol. 
Sample size 
Eighty-four patients were randomised to receive tasimelteon  (42 patients) or placebo (42 patients). 
Randomisation 
A randomisation list was prepared prior to the start of patient screening. The list contained blocks of size 4, i.e., 
each block of 4 treatments contained 2 from each treatment group in a random order. Randomisation was 
centrally performed through the IVRS system and was not stratified by study site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The patients and the medical staff were not aware of which treatment was administered. Data remained masked 
until database lock, at which time the randomization schedule was released for the purposes of assessment of 
drug safety and efficacy. All pre- and post-randomization τ calculations were conducted prior to database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoints were analysed by Barnard’s exact test, followed by a sensitivity analysis with Fisher’s 
exact test. The continuous efficacy endpoints were analysed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA). 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the results of the step-down endpoint (Clinical Response). The first 
analysis had threshold scores of > 2 for the N24CRS. The second and the third were conducted for individuals 
(regardless of entrainment status) with a N24CRS score of >3 and > 2, respectively. The last one was conducted 
for responders who are entrained in the randomization phase and that also have a N24CRS score of >3. 
No inferential statistics were produced for the analysis of data collected during the open-label extension. 
Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  Population  included  all  subjects  randomised  into  the  study  that  have  τ   calculated 
post-randomisation. 
Analysis Population included all subjects in the ITT population that have at least 70% of one circadian cycle of 
nTST data reported during each of screening and post-randomisation. The number of non-missing days of nTST 
data during each of screening and post-randomisation must have been be at least equal to the number of days 
that make up 70% of one circadian cycle. 
The Safety Population included all subjects randomised into the study who receive at least one dose of study 
medication. 
The ITT population was utilised for all circadian rhythm related outcomes: the primary endpoint of entrainment, 
the cortisol entrainment endpoint, and the aMT6s baseline secretion rate analyses, and the circadian analyte

analyses. The Analysis Population was used for analysis of all other endpoints including the step-down primary 
and all other efficacy analyses. 
Analyses of data collected during the open-label extension included all subjects enrolled that have received at 
least one dose of study medication.

* 52 patients entered the Open-Label Extension Phase from screening and 3 patients rolled over after 
completing the Randomization Phase. 
Recruitment 
The first subject enrolled on 25 August 2010 and the study was completed on 29 October 2012. 
The study was conducted in 33 investigative sites in the US (n=27) and Germany (n=6). 
Conduct of the study  
The  country-specific  protocol  for  Germany  also  allowed  for  an  Open-label  Extension  that  followed  the 
Randomisation Phase. 
The  original  protocol  was  amended  11  times.    None  of  the  changes  in  any  of  the  amendments  negatively 
impacted subject safety or integrity of the data collected during the course of the study.  
Baseline data 
There were 49 males and 35 females in the study. The mean age was 50.7 years with a range of 23 to 74 years. 
The majority of patients were White (83.3%) and not Hispanic or Latino (96.4%). 
The mean BMI was 27.95 kg/m2. Overall, the mean LQ-nTST, UQ-dTSD, nTST, and dTSD at screening were 3.2 
h, 2.4 h, 5.3 h, and 0.9 h, respectively. The mean τ values as measured by urinary aMT6s and cortisol were 
24.47 h and 24.45 h, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
For the double-blind phase, a total of 78 subjects were analysed for efficacy (Intent-to-Treat population) and 84 
subjects were analysed for safety (Safety population). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The summary of results of SET study is presented in the Table 13 below.  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 49/79 
 
  
  
  
Table 13: Summary of Primary Efficacy Endpoints (ITT and Analysis Populations)  
The proportion of Non-24 patients who were entrained after tasimelteon treatment was statistically significantly 
greater than the proportion of patients who were entrained after placebo treatment (% difference = 17.4; p = 
0.0171). 
The proportion of patients who were entrained (aMT6s) and had a clinical response rate (N24CRS) ≥3 after 
tasimelteon treatment was statistically significantly greater than the proportion of patients who were entrained 
and had a clinical response rate ≥3 after placebo treatment.  
Secondary Analyses  
Table 14 presents a summary of the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints. Tasimelteon was statistically 
significantly superior to placebo for entrainment (measured by cortisol) and all but one of the sleep/wake 
parameters.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
The subgroup factors, gender, race, age (<50 and ≥ 50), smoking status, with/without concomitant 
beta-blocker medications, and BMI (BMI<25, 25≤  BMI <30, and BMI ≥ 30), were explored to assess the impact 
on the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints. Treatment group differences were then evaluated 
within each subgroup. 
The results were generally consistent pointing towards a treatment effect in most subgroups. However two 
subgroups did not seem to benefit from treatment. These were the subjects receiving concomitant beta-blocker 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014

medication, where 0 out of 8 subjects on active entrained, and those with a BMI >= 30, where 0 out of the 14 
subjects on tasimelteon entrained.  
Post hoc Entrainment Rate Analysis 
To better estimate tasimelteon entrainment rate, the entrainment status for all patients randomised in Study 
3201 was assessed using circadian period assessments from all available time points. This included assessments 
conducted in the screening phase for Study 3203 for patients who continued directly from Study 3201 into Study 
3203. Patients were excluded from the entrainment rate calculation if 1) they did not have a minimum of 2 
aMT6s cosinor fit with p<0.05 for the τ calculation during randomization; 2) they had a τ >24.75 h; or 3) they 
had concomitant use of β-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Individuals with a Study 3201 baseline τ >24.75 were 
excluded  based  on  peer-reviewed  publications  that  suggested  that  these  individuals  may  not  entrain  with 
standard  melatonin  agonist  treatment  regimens.  Beta-1-blockers  block  sympathetic  signalling  to  the  pineal 
gland, resulting in suppression of night-time levels of melatonin. Consequently, patients with concomitant beta 
blocker usages were identified as a subpopulation for analysis and were excluded from this post hoc assessment. 
Under this assessment of entrainment, 54% (15/28) of the tasimelteon-treated patients achieved entrainment 
during the evaluation.  
Maintenance of effect 
Study VP-VEC-162-3203-(RESET)  Multi-centre, randomised withdrawal, double-masked, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the long-term maintenance effect 
and safety of 20 mg of tasimelteon versus placebo in patients with Non-24.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients who met the entrance criteria and who had previously participated in, or were screened for, Study 3201 
(SET) were eligible to participate. 
The inclusion criteria for the RESET run-in- phase was a non-entrained circadian rhythm (τ > 24.1 hours and a 
95% CI > 24.0 hours).  To be enrolled in the randomized withdrawal phase patients had to have responded to 
tasimelteon treatment during the run-in phase as measured by aMT6s, τ ≤ 24.1 hours and a 95% CI that 
included 24.0 hours.  
The study had 2 phases: a Pre-Randomisation Phase (consisting of an Open-label tasimelteon Run-in Phase 
[approximately 6 weeks] and a τ Estimation Phase [approximately 6 weeks]), and a Randomised Withdrawal 
Phase (8 weeks).  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 52/79 
 
  
  
  
Treatments 
During the tasimelteon Run-in Phase, all patients who met the eligibility criteria were treated with 20 mg/day of 
tasimelteon for 6 weeks. Patients were instructed to take their medication one hour prior to their defined 
bedtime at the same time every day.  During the τ Estimation Phase, all patients continued to receive 20 mg 
tasimelteon once daily. 
Patients whose aMT6s τ values after the open label phase indicated entrainment to a 24-hour clock were 
randomised to receive either placebo or 20 mg tasimelteon one hour before bedtime at the same time every day 
for 8 weeks during the Randomised Withdrawal Phase. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon to entrain 
circadian rhythms in patients with Non-24 as measured by urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). 
The secondary objectives of this study were the following: 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon to treat Non-24 as measured by the time to 
relapse, with relapse defined as a 45 minute or greater decrement in the weekly average subjective 
night-time total sleep time (nTST) compared to the Run-in-Phase;  
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon to entrain circadian rhythms in patients with 
Non-24 as assessed by urinary cortisol; 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon in patients with Non-24 as measured by the 
proportion of patients with non-entrainment and an average of 30 minutes or greater decrement of nTST 
compared to the Run-in Phase; 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon on subjective nTST in patients with Non-24, as 
assessed by the change from the Run-in Phase in the average nTST; 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 53/79 
 
  
  
  
 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon on subjective nTST in patients with Non-24 as 
assessed by the change from the Run-in Phase in the lower quartile of days of nTST (LQ-nTST); 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon on subjective daytime total sleep duration 
(dTSD) in patients with Non-24, as assessed by the change from the Run-in Phase in the average dTSD; 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon on subjective dTSD in patients with Non-24, as 
assessed by the change from the Run-in Phase in the upper quartile of days of dTSD (UQ-dTSD); 
•  To demonstrate the maintenance of effect of tasimelteon on the midpoint of sleep time (MoST); and 
•  To assess symptoms of withdrawal after a minimum of 3 months of tasimelteon treatment assessed by 
the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients who become non-entrained to a 24-hour 
day after randomisation to tasimelteon or placebo as measured by urinary 6-ulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). 
Non-entrainment is defined as a τ value ≥ 24.1 or the lower bound of 95% CI > 24.0.

Sample size 
Approximately 20 patients were planned to be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive tasimelteon (20 mg/day) 
or placebo during the Randomized Withdrawal Phase. 
Randomisation  
A randomisation list was prepared prior to the start of subject screening. The list contained blocks of size 4, i.e., 
each  block  of  4  treatments  contained  2  from  each  treatment  group  in  a  random  order.  Randomisation was 
centrally performed through the IVRS system and was not stratified by study site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The patients and the medical staff were not aware of which treatment was administered. Data remained masked 
until database lock, at which time the randomization schedule was released for the purposes of assessment of 
drug safety and efficacy. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014

Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was analysed using Barnard’s exact test.  Fisher’s exact test was used as the sensitivity 
analysis method. The difference of the proportion of people with “non-entrained” circadian rhythms in each 
treatment group, the 95% CI, as well as the p-value of the unconditional test, was to be presented in a summary 
table. 
Circadian  cycle  time  to  first  relapse  event  was  analysed  via  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  and  an  unstratified 
log-rank test for treatment group comparison. Circadian cycle time is based on an individual’s tau, a person 
with τ= 25 has a 24 day circadian cycle compared to a person with a τ = 24.5 who has a 48 day circadian cycle. 
Fifty percent of one circadian cycle would then be 12 days and 24 days respectively for the example above. 
Subjects who did not meet the criteria for a relapse event (i.e. a 45 minute decrement in their nTST) during the 
Randomised  Withdrawal  phase  were  censored  at  the  cycle  time  of  the  discontinuation  or  completion  of  the 
study.  A similar analysis, including the KM plot, was also done with actual calendar time to first relapse. 
The cortisol non-entrainment, as well as patients who are non-entrained as measured by aMT6s and have an 
average of 30 minutes or greater decrement of subjective night-time total sleep time (nTST) compared to the 
Run-in Phase, was summarised and analysed in the same manner of the primary endpoint in the ITT population. 
For  the  continuous  efficacy  variables,  descriptive  statistics  were  presented  by  treatment  groups.  Treatment 
groups were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the terms of treatment group and 
the corresponding efficacy value in  Run-in phase  as a covariate.  These  analyses  were  conducted in the  ITT 
Population. 
The  Intent-to-Treat  Population  included  all  subjects  randomised  into  the  study  that  have  τ  calculated 
post-randomisation. 
Results 
Recruitment 
This study started on 15 September 2011 and completed on 28 November 2012.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was amended 3 times.  None of the changes in any of the amendments negatively impacted 
subject safety or integrity of the data collected during the course of the study.  
Baseline data 
There were 12 males and 8 females in the Randomised Withdrawal phase. The mean age was 52.1 years. The 
mean BMI was 29.10 kg/m2. The mean LQ-nTST, UQ-dTSD, nTST, and dTSD during the run-in phase were 
4.717 h, 1.290 h, 6.255 h, and 0.503 h, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 58 patients who were screened for this study, one patient failed screening and was not enrolled in the 
Run-in Phase. A total of 57 patients received tasimelteon during the Run-in Phase; 37 of those patients failed the 
Run-in Phase and were not enrolled in the Randomised Withdrawal Phase. The most common reason for Run-in 
failure was that patients did not meet the inclusion criteria for the Randomised Withdrawal Phase: 24 (41.4%) 
patients.  An  equal  number  of  patients  were  randomized  into  each  treatment  group  of  the  Randomised 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 55/79 
 
  
  
  
Withdrawal Phase: 10 patients in the placebo group and 10 patients in the tasimelteon group. All randomised 
patients completed the Randomised Withdrawal Phase. 
Outcomes and estimation 
A statistically significant difference (70.0%; p = 0.0026) was observed between patients treated with 
Tasimelteon (10%). who became non-entrained and placebo treated patients (80%). The primary efficacy 
endpoint has been demonstrated. 
During the withdrawal randomisation phase, the difference in proportion of patients who became non-entrained 
(cortisol) after tasimelteon was statistically significantly lower than the proportion of Non-24 patients who 
became non-entrained after placebo treatment (% difference = -60.0; p = 0.0118 [Barnard’s Exact Test], p = 
0.0230 [Fisher’s Exact Test]). 
Statistically significant differences between tasimelteon treated and placebo treated patients were also 
observed in the nTST, dTSD and MoST.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analyses of entrainment at month 7 in a subset of patients who moved from SET study into the run-in period for 
the subsequent RESET study demonstrated that 59% of patients entrained by month 7.   
The combined data from SET and RESET demonstrated that entrainment response is maintained with continued 
tasimelteon  treatment  and  has  been  confirmed  in  patients  treated  for  9  months.  The  analysis  of  individual 
entrainment  status  for  each  circadian  rhythm  assessment  for  all  subjects  who  entrained during  the  Non-24 
development program in either SET or RESET showed that entrainment occurs at month 1 for some patients and 
may take more than one month of treatment for other patients.  Eight individuals treated with tasimelteon were 
entrained  when  assessed  at  month  1  in  SET  study.    Four  of  these  patients  participated  in  RESET  and  all  4 
continued to be entrained at month 7. Two of these 4 were randomized to continue tasimelteon treatment and 
both continued to be entrained at month 9.  In total there were 9 individuals who had entrainment assessed after 
9 months of tasimelteon treatment and 8/9 were entrained, demonstrating duration of entrainment response.  
Six individuals were not entrained at Month 1 but were entrained when measured at Month 7.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  safety  and  efficacy  studies  have  been  performed  in  special  populations.  Given  the  proposed  therapeutic 
indication, this was acceptable.  
2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The ability of tasimelteon to entrain the master body clock in Non-24 was investigated in two randomized 
double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trials, which were designed to provide evidence 
of short-term efficacy (SET study) and the maintenance of effect (RESET). The CHMP agreed that the design of 
the trials was appropriate.  As there is no other authorised treatment for Non-24, the CHMP agreed that placebo 
was an appropriate comparator.  
The N24CRS scale was designed by the applicant to be a specific and clinically meaningful measure of efficacy for 
treating Non-24 and was accepted by the CHMP for this purpose. Entrainment of circadian rhythm was measured 
by a urinary melatonin metabolite, aMT6s and was declared to be the primary endpoint for both studies.  
The measurements of the urinary aMT6s, and of urinary cortisol for patients in the home environment are well 
established and accepted measurements of the circadian pacemaker. The pattern of production of aMT6s in both 
plasma and urine reproduces the pattern of measurable melatonin secretion. Peak urinary aMT6s production 
normally occurs 3.5 hours before wake time and peak plasma melatonin normally occurs 6 hours before wake 
time. Measurement of salivary and plasma melatonin rhythms is normally done in a study centre but in the 
pivotal trials it was done at home environment to reflect real-world conditions and to minimize the burden on the 
patients. The CHMP endorsed this choice of endpoint. 
No discussion on Quality of Life improvement has been provided and no formal QoL measurements have been 
developed. However, the applicant stated that the global functioning was measured via clinician and patient 
reported outcomes. The absence of a formal QoL assessment was justified by the lack of approved scales for 
assessment  of  quality  of  life  in  blind  people.  The  Applicant  is planning  to  conduct  a  QoL  assessment  in  the 
ongoing 3202 study and in the paediatric population. The results of the Clinical Global Impression of Change 
(CGI-C) from the SET study and CGI-C, Patient Impression of Change (PGI-C) and nigh-time and daytime sleep 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 61/79 
 
  
  
  
from the RESET study show a significant improvement in the global functions. This explanation was accepted by 
the CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  SET,  tasimelteon  entrained  circadian  rhythms  at  month  1  at  a  significantly  higher  rate  than  placebo  as 
measured by aMT6s and cortisol (20% vs. 2.6 % [p= 0.0171] and 17.5% vs 2.6% [p= 0.0313] respectively). 
Analyses of entrainment at month 7 in a subset of patients who moved directly into RESET study demonstrated 
that 59% of treated patients entrained by month 7, indicating that response to treatment may take weeks or 
months for some patients to respond.   
Tasimelteon has demonstrated superiority to placebo in both studies and most secondary endpoints also point 
towards a beneficial effect. However the response rates in most endpoints are around 20%, so only a minority 
of subjects seem to benefit from treatment. The study population was selected based on the circadian period (τ) 
length and excluded subjects unlikely to benefit from Tasimelteon. Treatment was then started at the optimum 
point in their circadian phase to optimise treatment response.  
The  N24CRS  scale  and  scoring  has  been  created  by  the  applicant  its  clinical  relevance  required  further 
clarification. The CHMP requested the Applicant to calculate response rates to the individual components of the 
N24CRS scale for all subjects in the ITT population. 
The presented analyses demonstrated that the proportions of responders were higher in the tasimelteon group 
compared to the placebo group in all clinical components, thereby easing concerns that the overall N24CRS 
response may not have extended to all individual components. It was also reassuring that a treatment effect was 
still apparent when the whole ITT population is analysed, rather than only looking at those entrained.  
The mean and median values for the continuous endpoints have also been presented and suggest a skewed 
distribution.  The  applicant  therefore  carried  out  a  permutation  ANCOVA  t-test  on  the  residuals  from  the 
protocol-specified ANCOVA model with the treatment term excluded. Results from this non-parametric analysis 
also demonstrate statistical superiority of tasimelteon when compared to placebo.  
In  the  SET  pivotal  efficacy  study,  initiation  of  dosing  was  attempted  to  coincide  with  when  the  patient  was 
predicted to be “in-phase”. This was not proposed in clinical practice because it requires 24 hour urine collections 
but the CHMP noted that it may lead to less efficient entrainment. The applicant provided further discussion on 
this topic. The CHMP agreed that it would be very challenging logistically to the patient and physician to initiate 
treatment at a time when a patient will be “in-phase”.  The applicant also stated that due to the lack of evidence 
in  the  tasimelteon  development  program  for  improved  efficacy  when  treatment  is  initiated  in-phase  versus 
without  regard  to  phase,  prescribing  instructions  should  not  require  treatment  initiation  when  patients  are 
in-phase. The CHMP agreed that the entrainment rate irrespective of phase is acceptable, particularly in view of 
the benign safety profile of tasimelteon.   
The CHMP noted that, in theory, the endpoints of entrainment and response could have been reached briefly 
during the study for the patient to be counted positive for the endpoint. The applicant was asked to provide 
individual data for time to entrain and/or respond and duration of entrainment and/or response. The analysis of 
the combined data from SET and RESET demonstrated that entrainment response is maintained with continued 
tasimelteon treatment and has been confirmed in patients treated for 9 months. It has been confirmed that 
entrainment is solid rather than fleeting.   
As only 20% of patients became entrained in Study 3201, the CHMP has asked the Applicant to analyse if there 
were any physical and or psychosocial predictors of entrainment/response.  In the SET study (3201) the primary 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 62/79 
 
  
  
  
endpoint  of  entrainment  was  measured  at  one  month  and  20%  of  patients  were  responders.  However,  the 
applicant stated that it is likely that this is an underestimate of the true rate of entrainment and that an adequate 
trial of tasimelteon treatment requires more than one month of treatment for some patients, as demonstrated 
in RESET study. This has been accepted by the CHMP. The CHMP also acknowledged that the database was too 
small  to  identify  factors  which  might  be  associated  with  success  or  failure  by  means  of  formal  analysis. 
Consequently, there are no clinical pointers to patients who might be expected to respond well or poorly to 
tasimelteon.  The  CHMP  endorsed  applicant’s  recommendation  that  the  physicians  should  evaluate  patient 
response  to  tasimelteon  3  months  after  initiating  treatment  utilizing  a  clinician  interview  to  assess  their 
sleep-wake response and overall functioning.   
The lack of efficacy observed in the SET study with concomitant beta-1-blockers administration, was attributed 
to their action to block sympathetic signalling to the pineal gland, resulting in suppression of night-time levels of 
melatonin. The CHMP agreed with this justification and an appropriate warning was included in the SmPC.  The 
CHMP questioned if BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 can be considered to be a risk for non-response as a result of different PK 
profile in this population. However, the Applicant has demonstrated that the PK of these patients does not have 
lower initial concentration due to a larger volume of distribution and that individuals with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 do 
entrain. While no patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 entrained in SET study, 36.4% did in RESET during the run-in 
phase, and no difference could be detected among BMI categories.  The CHMP accepted this explanation.  
The CHMP agreed with the applicant’s recommendation in the SmPC that tasimelteon should preferably be dosed 
at the same time every day because of its circadian entrainment characteristics. It has been acknowledged that 
normal circadian entrainment requires exposure to a consistent 24 hour time cue and inconsistent timing of dose 
can result in loss of entrainment. 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The SET and RESET studies demonstrated the ability of tasimelteon to entrain the master body clock in patients 
with Non-24, and the RESET demonstrated that continued daily dosing of tasimelteon is necessary to maintain 
entrainment. Both studies have demonstrated the superiority of Tasimelteon over placebo. 
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The Applicant has provided safety data from fourteen Phase I studies, two Phase II studies and six Phase III 
studies. The safety data up to October 2013 was included in the safety database.  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 63/79 
 
  
  
  
The applicant further grouped the exposed population as follows. 
Following the CHMP request, the applicant has provided combined overall safety data from the entire population 
exposed to the medication including those in research for other indications and post-marketing data. The 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 64/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
applicant has also been asked to provide a summary of the length of exposure, including the length of treatment 
with < 20 mg, 20 mg, and >20 mg doses.  
Adverse events 
The AEs were classified using MedDRA dictionary. The events were assessed for severity and relationship to 
study medication by the investigators.  
The most frequently reported adverse events in tasimelteon-treated patients across multiple study groups 
occurring more frequently than in placebo-treated subjects were headache, somnolence, and nightmares or 
unusual dreams. 
The table 17 below shows a summary of adverse events (except euphoric mood, and the addition of 
nightmares), which are considered as having a reasonable plausibility of causality based on comparative 
incidence in the clinical trials and evaluation of causality from individual case reports. Consequently, they were 
listed in the SmPC as adverse drug reactions. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 65/79 
 
  
  
  
Table 17: Select Adverse Events reported in the entire exposed population with a relatedness frequency greater 
than 50% 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no recorded deaths in the course of the clinical trials included in the safety database. 
For all studies, 21 (21/1,654, 1.3%) subjects experienced serious adverse events. Of these, 19 were reported 
in the tasimelteon group. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 15 (1.1%) tasimelteon-treated subjects 
and 2 placebo subjects (<1.0%). 
Of the 21 subjects reporting serious adverse events, none of these events are considered to be related to study 
medication by the applicant. There was no specific trend observed in incidence of SAEs. 
4 SAEs (rhabdomyolysis, cholestasis, Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia and serotonin syndrome) were designated 
as important although described as not related by the applicant.  
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 66/79 
 
  
  
  
 
Laboratory findings 
The clinical laboratory data include measurements in patients from all study Groups. Blood samples for 
haematology and serum biochemistry were taken at baseline and reassessed during and at the end of 
treatment. Overall, tasimelteon has no clinically meaningful effect on any haematology, biochemistry or 
urinalysis parameters. 
There were no laboratory value based clinical safety signals identifiable from the clinical studies, apart from ALT 
increase of >3x ULN after exposure to tasimelteon, which was reported in 19 of 1772 clinical trial subjects. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
A total of 251 subjects > 65 years of age participated in this clinical development program. Dry mouth, 
nasopharyngitis, back pain, and somnolence were reported as TEAEs with higher incidence in 
tasimelteon-treated elderly subjects than in tasimelteon-treated non-elderly subjects. It is of interest that 
nightmares and unusual dreams have not been recorded in the elderly group. 
Paediatric Patients 
The safety and effectiveness of tasimelteon in paediatric and adolescent patients below the age of 18 has not 
been established. 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tasimelteon in the following subsets of the paediatric population in Non-24 in the totally blind: preterm and/or 
term newborn infants (0-27 days) and infants and toddlers (28 days to 23 months). The EMA has deferred the 
obligation to submit the results of studies with tasimelteon in the following subsets of the paediatric population 
in Non-24 in the totally bind: children (2 to 11 years); adolescents (12 to 18 years).  
Hepatic Impairment

Immunological events 
There were 23 subjects with potential immunological events. Of those only 3 are cases of environmental and 
nasal allergies. There were also further 2 reports of urticaria.  One event occurred in Study VP-VEC-162-1110, 
in a subject receiving active comparator (midazolam) to which the event was attributed, and the other event 
occurred in VP-VEC-162-COSET, in a subject who was receiving placebo treatment and was taking the 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 67/79 
 
  
  
  
concomitant medication of terbinafine, to which the event was attributed. The remaining 18 events were various 
cases of skin rash occurring at higher frequency in placebo subjects than in tasimelteon treated subjects. 
No immunological safety signal was identified. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In all subjects in all studies, the overall discontinuation rate for any reason was 7.8% in the tasimelteon group 
compared with 6.9% for the placebo group. The most common reason for discontinuation in both (placebo and 
active) groups was AE. 
Table 18: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Trial Medication by 
study population sub-group 
In Study Group 3, there were no significant differences in the overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the 
tasimelteon group (3/52, 5.8%) compared to the placebo group (2/52, 3.8%). 
In Group 4, 19/184 subjects (10.3%) discontinued due to treatment-emergent AEs. This rate was higher than 
the rate of 5.8% in Study Group 3. These difference have been explained by the extended open-label phase in 
SET, and the longer follow-up period in the long-term safety studies (3202 and 3204) compared to the primary 
efficacy studies (SET and RESET). 
Post marketing experience 
The aggregate safety reports with post-authorisation data through 31 October 2014 as submitted to the US Food 
and Drug Administration were provided by the applicant. No new safety data or problems have been identified 
in clinical practice. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
An analysis of the adverse events experienced in the total clinical trial population did not reveal any new safety 
risks and was consistent with the safety profile established in patients with Non-24. 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 68/79 
 
  
  
  
 
Euphoric mood was further examined by the Applicant and the vast majority of reports occurred with ethanol use 
during the ethanol interaction drug trial (VP-VEC-162-1108). Therefore, the CHMP considered that euphoric 
mood was not having a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship to tasimelteon and therefore is not 
included in the SmPC. In addition, due to the similarity between nightmares and abnormal dreams, nightmare 
was also considered to have a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship between the medicinal product and 
the adverse event and therefore was included in the SmPC.  
The applicant has been asked by the CHMP to elaborate on the pharmacodynamic mechanisms and clinical 
implications of nightmares and unusual dreams. Primary and expanded safety analyses revealed that abnormal 
dreams and nightmares were largely transient and mild in nature without clinical sequelae and could be reported 
at any time after treatment initiation. The potential mechanism of this effect is not fully known or understood; 
however, this effect is likely related to tasimelteon’s action to normalize REM stage sleep accumulation and 
resultant increased REM episodes with longer sleep episodes.  
The CHMP agreed that the single report of rhabdomyolysis does not indicate a safety concern related to the use 
of tasimelteon nor a relationship to a change in sleep architecture resulting from tasimelteon use. No 
information obtained from clinical trials to date indicated that the use of tasimelteon results in disturbance of the 
sleep architecture, disruptive sleep behaviours nor parasomnias. The CHMP was of the opinion, that while the 
recorded events cannot be seen as a safety signal, it is necessary to address the possibility of such events being 
rare but related. The regular pharmacovigilance activities are expected to address the potential risks. 
The CHMP has also asked the Applicant to summarise information on effect of tasimelteon withdrawal on 
circadian rhythms and to justify with the clinical evidence whether this presents a safety concern.  The RESET 
study showed that entrainment is maintained only by continued dosing with Tasimelteon and that withdrawal 
from it brings the patients back to their original circadian rhythm. There does not appear to be physical or 
mental dependence to tasimelteon that results in “withdrawal” symptoms as typically observed with drugs like 
anti-depressants or opioids. The benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom questionnaire (BWSQ) administered in 
Study 3104, SET and RESET evaluated for drug withdrawal, and overall, there were no reported instances of 
withdrawal effects following discontinuation of tasimelteon, even when safety was evaluated up to 30 days 
post-treatment. There were also no indications of a worsening of insomnia symptoms compared to baseline, or 
a rebound insomnia effect, upon withdrawal of tasimelteon treatment. Based upon all the available data, the 
CHMP concluded that there is no evidence of withdrawal symptoms or abuse liability associated with tasimelteon 
use or its discontinuation. 
The applicant has investigated cardiac safety in a separate study conducted in healthy volunteers. Results from 
this study and the recorded events overall do not raise any specific cardiac safety concerns. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the available data, there are no safety signals that would preclude granting of a marketing 
authorisation. 
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance  
The CHMP considers that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicant’s pharmacovigilance system summary 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 69/79 
 
  
  
  
includes a reference to the location where the pharmacovigilance system master file for the medicinal product is 
kept and provides proof that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in Title IX of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.10.  Risk Management Plan

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The SET and RESET studies demonstrated the ability of tasimelteon to entrain the master body clock in patients 
with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder, and the RESET demonstrated that continued daily dosing of 
tasimelteon is necessary to maintain entrainment. Both studies have demonstrated the superiority of 
Tasimelteon over placebo. 
The primary endpoints were achieved for SET and RESET and most secondary endpoints also showed a 
beneficial effect. The overall response rates in most endpoints was around 20%. In the post-hoc analysis, 
patients with concomitant beta-blocker and with a τ >24.75 were excluded from the analysis. Under this 
assessment the response rate of entrainment of the tasimelteon-treated patients achieved 54%. Analyses of 
entrainment in RESET study at month 7 in a subset of patients demonstrated that 59% of treated patients 
entrained by month 7, indicating that response to treatment may take weeks or months for some patients to 
respond.  This late response suggests that time to response may be influenced by the individual’s endogenous 
cycle length and the point in the cycle during which dose is initiated. 
The SET and RESET studies showed significant improvement compared to placebo both in increasing nighttime 
sleep and decreasing daytime sleep duration. Compared to placebo, treatment with tasimelteon resulted in a 
greater improvement in post-randomisation Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scores which reflects 
the general social, occupational and health functioning of the patient. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In SET study, patients with a circadian period (τ) length whose upper bound of 95% CI exceeded 24.9 hours 
were excluded from the randomisation, as they were not expected to benefit from treatment. In the RESET 
study, the population was also selected based on the circadian period (τ) length and excluded subjects unlikely 
EMA/CHMP/601383/2014 
Page 76/79 
 
  
  
  
 
 
to benefit from tasimelteon. Treatment was then started at the optimum point in their circadian phase to 
optimise treatment response. Therefore, it is possible that the response rate in the general non-24 population 
may be lower than observed in the clinical trials.  
Subgroup analyses in SET study were only conducted for the entrainment endpoints. The results were generally 
consistent pointing towards a treatment effect in most subgroups. The CHMP acknowledged that the clinical 
trials database was too small to identify factors which might be associated with success or failure by means of 
formal analysis. The SET and RESET statistical analysis plans did not pre-specify analyses of predicators of 
tasimelteon response.  Consequently, there are no clinical pointers to patients who might be expected to 
respond well or poorly to tasimelteon. The CHMP endorsed applicant’s recommendation that the physicians 
should evaluate patient response to tasimelteon 3 months after initiating treatment utilizing a clinician interview 
to assess their sleep-wake response and overall functioning.   
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Based on the available data, no serious toxicity has been identified so far. Tasimelteon does not seem to cause 
any clinically significant changes in vital signs and ECG. There were no laboratory value based clinical safety 
signals identifiable from the clinical studies, apart from ALT increase of >3x ULN after exposure to tasimelteon, 
which was reported in 19 of 1772 clinical trial subjects. 
The most frequent adverse events recorded which were found to be related to the study medication were: 
Headache, Somnolence and Nightmares/Unusual Dreams.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is still some uncertainty regarding quantitative importance of enzyme pathways for which the applicant 
has been requested to conduct a series of in vitro and in vivo studies and analysis of the available genotype 
information as post–approval commitment in order to further elucidate the contribution of different enzyme 
pathways and better inform the SmPC regarding the risk of drug-drug interactions. 
Further non-clinical evaluation of Tasimelteon phototoxic potential is also required as post-approval measure.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Tasimelteon is a melatonin analogue, a member of a class of medicinal products generally considered to have a 
benign safety profile. Like other members of the class, it is well tolerated and appears to be clinically safe.   
In consideration of the fact that Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder is an orphan and debilitating condition and 
tasimelteon causes only few mild side effects, a response rate of 20% is still considered important for the 
patients who would benefit from this treatment. In the post-hoc analysis of the subpopulation most likely to 
benefit from the treatment, the rate of entrainment of the tasimelteon-treated patients achieved 54%. The 
increased response of entrainment (59%) at month 7 in the subset of patients who moved directly from SET into 
RESET study indicates that an even better response can be expected with time.

Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers benefit-risk balance of tasimelteon in the treatment of Non-24 sleep-wake disorder to be 
positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
For some totally visually impaired individuals, the sleeplessness and daytime somnolence that result from being 
non-entrained have profound impacts on their social and occupational lives. Despite the severity of the disorder 
there is no other approved treatment for Non-24 sleep-wake disorder in the EU. 
As the adverse effects identified so far are mild and reversible, even modest benefit is judged to be sufficient to 
outweigh the risks. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the

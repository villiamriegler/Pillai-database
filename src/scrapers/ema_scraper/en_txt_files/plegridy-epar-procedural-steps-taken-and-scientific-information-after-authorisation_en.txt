Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC in order to update 
30/03/2023 
SmPC and PL 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated regarding breast-
the information relating to secretion in human milk 
based on the results from study US-PEG-15-10936, a 
prospective, open label, post marketing study that 
measured Plegridy concentrations in breast milk in 6 
lactating patients with Multiple Sclerosis. 
feeding since information available overall suggests that 
levels of interferon beta-1a/peginterferon beta-1a excreted 
in human milk are negligible and no harmful effects on the 
breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.  
The PL has been updated accordingly. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

To update sections 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC in order

treatment in pregnancy and to update the 
recommendations on use in pregnancy and 
breastfeeding following the completion of the 
European IFN Beta Pregnancy Registry (8th Annual 
and final report) and the Final CSR of the register-
based study in the Nordic countries (EUPAS13054). 
The MAH took the opportunity to add information 
about traceability in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The Package leaflet has been updated accordingly.

contraindication ‘initiation of treatment in pregnancy’. 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated as follows:  
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy 
outcomes) from registries and post-marketing experience 
indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies 
after pre-conception exposure to interferon beta or such 
exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, 
the duration of exposure during the first trimester is 
uncertain, because data were collected when interferon

The RMP has been updated (ver 4.3) to include 
changes to the safety specification related to 
Pregnancy missing information status, in light of the 
new safety information received, as well as updates 
to other key sections of the RMP, adapting to the 
requirements of the GVP Module 5 revision 2 
guidelines.

beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and 
treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected 
and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the 
second and third trimester is very limited.  
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly 
increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  The risk of 
spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to 
interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on 
the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an 
increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Plegridy may be considered 
during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether peginferferon beta-1a is secreted 
in human milk. Limited information available on the 
transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together 
with the chemical / physiological characteristics of 
interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects 
on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.  
Plegridy can be used during breast-feeding.  
The PL has been updated accordingly.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

Plegridy in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Review of available evidence supports the possibility of a

anaphylaxis. RMP version 3.3 was also approved. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
causal relationship between use of peginterferon beta-1a 
and anaphylactic reaction. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC were updated to include information on anaphylaxis.  
The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated to include 
reference to cases of anaphylaxis, to read as follows:

data 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including cases of 
anaphylaxis have been reported as a rare complication of 
treatment with interferon beta, including Plegridy. Patients 
should be advised to discontinue Plegridy and seek 
immediate medical care if they experience signs and 
symptoms of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity. 
Treatment with Plegridy should not be restarted. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC, under ‘Hypersensitivity reactions’ 
now mentions that in post marketing experience, serious 
hypersensitivity events including cases of anaphylaxis have 
been reported (with frequency not known) following 
Plegridy administration.

The following revisions were introduced in section 4 of the 
Package Leaflet to add information on managing flu-like 
symptoms (new text bold, old text in strikethrough mode): 
Three simple ways to help reduce the impact of flu-like 
symptoms: 
1. (Strikethrough text) Use your Plegridy injection just 
before bedtime. This may allow you to sleep through the 
effects. (To be replaced with the following text) Consider 
the timing of your Plegridy injection. The start and end of 
flu-like symptoms are different for every patient. On 
average, flu-like symptoms begin approximately 10 hours 
after injection and last between 12 and 24 hours. 
2. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen half an hour before your 
Plegridy injection. (Strikethrough text) and continue taking 
it for up to a day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about 
(To be replaced with the following text) how much to take 
and how long to take it. (Strikethrough text) the right dose.  
3. If you have a fever, drink plenty of water to keep you 
hydrated.

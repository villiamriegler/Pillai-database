2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects more than 180 million people worldwide and particularly in the 
industrialised countries the incidence of the disorder is increasing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is 
characterised by multiple metabolic abnormalities involving insulin resistance, impaired insulin 
secretion, and increased glucose production. Morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus is caused by macrovascular complications such as cardiovascular disease and microvascular 
complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In addition to diet and exercise, a 
number of medications are available to lower blood sugar levels. However, all of the established 
therapies have limitations including a range of safety and tolerability issues, limited extent and/or 
durability of efficacy, and inconvenience in dosing. The most common adverse events associated with 
currently used agents are hypoglycaemia (with sulfonylureas, meglitinides, insulin), weight gain (with 
sulfonylureas, meglitinides, insulin, thiazolidinediones [TZDs]), and gastrointestinal intolerance (with 
metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). Dipeptidyl-dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are generally well 
tolerated; treatment with the currently marketed DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin) 
was however associated with elevated incidences of infections and gastrointestinal disorders 
(compared with placebo). Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptin are either not indicated in patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment or require dose adjustments in this patient population. 
Current regulatory guidelines emphasize the need for a thorough investigation of the cardiovascular 
risk profile of antidiabetic medications. 
About the product 
Linagliptin is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based DPP-4 inhibitor. GLP-1 lowers blood 
glucose levels by augmenting the glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, GLP-1 inhibits glucagon 
secretion, slows gastric emptying, and induces satiety. The plasma half-life of GLP-1 is limited to a few 
minutes because of rapid proteolytic degradation by the enzyme DPP-4. Inhibition of DPP-4 prolongs 
the half-life of active GLP-1 and thereby increases plasma insulin levels and lowers plasma glucose 
levels. Since GLP-1 activity ceases when the glucose concentration falls below 55 mg/dL, prolongation 
of the half-life of GLP-1 by DPP-4 inhibitors bears little risk of hypoglycaemia. Linagliptin is a selective, 
competitive, reversible inhibitor of human DPP-4 with a 50% Inhibitor Concentration (IC50) of 1 nM. 
The therapeutic dose of linagliptin will be 5 mg. Linagliptin is predominantly excreted unchanged via 
the faeces. Renal excretion is a minor pathway of elimination of linagliptin at therapeutic doses. Thus, 
linagliptin is especially suited for the treatment of patients with renal impairment without the need for 
dose adjustment. 
The claim indication for linagliptin was:

Type of Application and aspects of the development 
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  - 
complete and independent application (new active substance) 
Initial scientific advice was sought from the CHMP for clinical issues on 16 May 2007 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/ 385760/2007). Subsequently, the clinical program was revised and a follow-up 
Scientific Advice was sought on 23 April 2008. (EMEA/CHMP/ SAWP/311988/2008). The emphasis of 
the meetings was on the design features of the phase III trials, particularly dosing, the adequacy of 
the safety database, and the non-inferiority margin in the active-controlled 1218.20 trial. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Composition 
Trajenta is presented as light red, round, biconvex immediate release film-coated tablets containing 5 
mg of linagliptin as the active substance. 
Other ingredients include mannitol, pregelatinised starch, maize starch, copovidone, magnesium 
stearate in the tablet core and hypromellose, titanium dioxide, talc, macrogol 6000 and red iron oxide 
for the film coating.  
The finished product is packed in aluminium/aluminium blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of linagliptin is 8-[(3R)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-7-(but-2-yn-1-yl)-3-methyl-1-[(4-
methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione. The structural formula is shown 
below: 
Page 6/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure has been confirmed by means of UV, IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry. The content of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen have been determined by elemental 
analysis.  
Linagliptin has one chiral centre at the 3-aminopiperidine moiety. The active substance corresponds to 
the R-enantiomer. The absolute configuration of the active substance at the chiral carbon has been 
determined by means of single X-ray crystallography.   
It is a white to yellowish crystalline solid substance. It is slightly hygroscopic, but water uptake does 
not change the crystal modification. It is very soluble in aqueous media (> 1 mg/ml) over the entire 
physiological pH range. It is soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble 
in isopropanol and acetone. 
The active substance simultaneously exists in two polymorphic forms, which are enantiotropically 
related and which reversibly convert into each other approximately at room temperature. The two 
polymorphic forms do not differ with regard to biopharmaceutical properties. 
Manufacture 
The synthetic process for linagliptin consists of three steps and then a milling step follows. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail including suitable reaction schemes. 
The amounts of raw materials, yields, and equipment have been specified, and the in-process controls 
have been well described.  
The levels of the impurities with an acceptance criterion higher than max. 0.15% are supported by the 
results of toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set. There are no impurities 
arising from the starting materials. 
The synthetic process does not involve Class 1 solvents or metal catalysts. The Class 2 and the Class 3 
solvents used in the synthesis have been shown to be efficiently removed during the process and 
appropriate specifications have been set in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Impurities: 
Residual Solvents.  
Specification 
The specifications of the active substance contains tests with suitable limits for appearance (visually), 
identification (IR spectrum, Chiral HPLC, Melting point), impurity (GC, HPLC, Chiral-HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), water content (KF), sulphated ash (weighing), particle size (Laser-beam diffraction) and 
Assay (HPLC)  
The analytical methods used have been adequately validated in accordance with the Note for Guidance 
on Validation of Analytical Methods: Definitions and Terminology / Methodology.  
Batch analysis results have been provided for 14 batches manufactured according to the proposed 
synthetic process. In all cases the results demonstrate compliance with the proposed active substance 
specifications. 
Page 7/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability studies have been conducted in accordance with ICH requirements on three commercial 
batches manufactured with the proposed route of synthesis. The samples were stored for up to 36 
months under the conditions for long term storage and up to 6 months under accelerated conditions. 
The parameters tested included appearance, melting temperature, organic impurities, enantiomeric 
purity, water content, assay and particle size. The analytical methods used were stability indicating. In 
all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed retest period. 
In addition, one batch was subjected to stress studies at elevated temperature, humidity, pH, oxidativ
e 
conditions and light in the solid state and in solution. Photostability testing of the solid active 
substance was also performed according to ICH guideline Q1B. The parameters tested included 
appearance, melting temperature, organic impurities, enantiomeric purity, water content and assay. 
The results of the stress studies demonstrated that in solid for
m, the active substance is very stable at 
elevated temperatures, high humidity and the combined effect of both conditions. During photostability 
testing, only a slight change in colour was obse
rved, but no change in impurity profile leading to the 
conclusion that the active substance is not sensitive to light.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the product development was to obtain an immediate release oral dosage form with 
rapid disintegration and dissolution, preferably as a film-coated tablet formulation. 
Linagliptin is a highly soluble active substance. It 
is considered to be a Class 3 drug substance (high 
solubility, poor permeability) according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) due to i
ts 
incomplete oral systemic bioavailability (about 30% compared to intravenous administration) and the 
moderate permeability observed in Caco-2 cells. 
Due to the low active substance content in the final formulation, the active subs
tance is milled to 
ensure an adequate content uniformity. Several particle size ranges were investigated and a change i
n 
the active substance particle size distribution within the investigated range has no relevant influence 
on in-vitro dissolution while the content uniformity of the tablets is acceptable. 
The excipients chosen for the formulation development are commonly used in oral pharmaceutic
al 
dosage forms and comply with PhEur requirements. All components are inert showing no interac
tions 
with drug release.  
A standard aqueous wet granulation process was chosen to manufacture the product. All critical 
process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls.  
The manufacturing process of the pi
votal studies of phase II and III were identical. There are only 
some marginal differences regarding the pigment of the film-coating between t
he formulation used for 
the phase III studies and the commercial product. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used for Trajenta are of animal or human origin 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is a standard process for these kinds of formulations such as: blending, wet 
granulation,  compression  and  coating.  The
  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  validated 
according  to  the  releva
nt  European  guidelines.  Process  validation  data  were  presented  and 
demonstrate  that  the  process  is  reproducible  and  provides  a  drug  product  that  complies  with  the 
in-
process and finished product specifications. 
Page 8/84
 
 
 
 
 
Product Specification 
The product specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (UV spectrum, HPLC), 
loss on drying (weighing), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC or NIR), assay (HPLC), 
and degradation products (HPLC). The release and shelf life limits differ with regard to the fact that 
identification and uniformity of dosage units is only tested at release. The other acceptance criteria
 do 
not differ between release and shelf 
life.  
The analytical methods used for release and shelf life testing have been adequately described and 
validated. 
Batch analysis data from adequate number of batches at full scale and smaller batches have been 
provided to demonstrate compliance with the proposed release specifications. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability studies were carried out according to the ICH requirements. Samples were stored at 
25°C/60 % RH for up to 24 months and in 40°C/75 % RH for 6 months.  
The parameters te
sted were description, loss on drying, dissolution, degradation products, assay, and 
microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are identical to those proposed for routine testing of 
the commercial product and are stability indicating. Validated pharmacopoeial methods are applied for 
microbial testing. 
In addition, a stress stability study investigating the effects of elevated temperature, humidity, and 
light was conducted accoring to ICH and analytical data found to be within the shelf life specifications. 
On the basis of the provided stability data, the assigned shelf life as defined in the Summary of P
roduct 
Characteristics (SmPC) is well supported. The product does not require any specific storage conditions. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Trajenta is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and phar
maceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
The active substance is well characterised and documented. It simultaneously exists in two 
polymorphic forms, which however do not differ with regard to relevant physicochemical properties. 
The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. Eur. 
requireme
nts. The packaging material is commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing 
process of the finished product is a standard process that has been adequately described. Stability 
tests indicate that the product
 under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed 
shelf life. 
Quality Development 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological a
spects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfac
tory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support the clinical evaluation of linagliptin a number of non-clinical pharmacology and toxicity 
studies were conducted prior to and in parallel with the clinical program. These studies included a 
battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, acute and 
repeated dose oral studies, rodent carcinogenicity studies, developmental and reproductive toxicity 
studies. 
All pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in line with ICH Non-clinical Testing Guidelines 
and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements.  
CHMP Scientific advice concerning non-clinical studies was not sought. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Linagliptin is a potent, selective, orally active, competitive, reversible and long-acting inhibitor of 
dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This membrane bound protease is expressed in many tissues including 
kidneys, liver, intestine, lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells. A significant level of DPP-4 activity 
is also observed in plasma. By inhibiting DPP-4, linagliptin prolongs and enhances activity of the 
incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), resulting 
in increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion and delay of 
gastric emptying and thereby to the maintenance of post-meal glycemic control. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro, linagliptin potently and selectively inhibited DPP-4 activity, whereas its main metabolite, 
CD1790, was pharmacologically inactive. 
In both normal and diabetic mice and rats, the results of the studies showed that oral administration of 
linagliptin significantly inhibits plasma DPP-4 activity accompanied by improvements in glucose 
homeostasis and glucose tolerance. In diabetic rats, linagliptin also significantly increased glucose-
induced elevations of GLP-1 and insulin. Although efficacious in diabetic animals, the magnitude of 
decreasing blood glucose is dependent on the severity of insulin resistance in these animals. In Zucker 
Diabetic Fatty rats, which suffer from defects in insulin secretion and severe insulin resistance, 
linagliptin less significantly reduced blood glucose levels than in normal animals.  
In Rhesus monkeys and Beagle dogs, linagliptin also inhibited DPP-4 activity >70% within 30 min and 
was maintained for at least 7 hours. However, no blood glucose levels were measured to strengthen 
the results. The IC50 values of 0.23 nM for cynomolgus DPP4 and 0.20 nM for the human DPP-4 show 
that potency is comparable in both species and lies in the subnanomolar range. This shows the 
suitability of cynomolgus monkeys as selected species. 
Long duration of action in terms of both inhibition of DPP-4 and glycaemic control was, however, 
demonstrated in mice and rats orally dosed with linagliptin. The results of these studies suggest that a 
once daily dosing frequency is adequate to maintain an appropriate degree of DPP-4 inhibition that 
exerts therapeutic effects on glucose.  
Long-term treatment of diabetic mice reduced fed plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
after 14 and 28 days. This improved hyperglycaemia could not be explained by improved insulin 
sensitivity by linagliptin. 
Page 10/84
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies (non-GLP) were performed to investigate the potential of 
linagliptin to induce neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and renal effects.  
In vitro, linagliptin inhibited the human muscarinic receptors M1, M2 and M3, but the matching IC50 
values were significantly higher than the IC50 value by which linagliptin inhibits DPP-4. In vivo, 
administration of 30 mg/kg linagliptin to conscious rats significantly increased protein and fat 
metabolism and probably led to hepatocellular stress. Although no toxicokinetic measurements were 
obtained in these studies, administration of 5 mg/kg linagliptin to male rats in a single dose toxicity 
study resulted in a Cmax of 547 nM, compared to the clinical Cmax of 11.1 nM. Overall, linagliptin 
appears not to have potential off-target activity when administered at therapeutic concentrations. 
Although inhibition of DPP-4 may result in decreased gastric emptying, this effect was not observed in 
the secondary pharmacodynamic study evaluating the effect of linagliptin on gastrointestinal function 
in rats. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed to examine the potential effects of linagliptin on 
cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems. 
Although in vitro cardiovascular safety studies indicated a low pro-arrhythmic potential for linagliptin, 
this potential was not confirmed by the results of the in vivo cardiovascular safety studies. Moreover, 
administration of supratherapeutic concentrations of linagliptin did not significantly affect respiratory 
and central nervous system function in rats.  
Overall, data from the safety pharmacology supports the clinical development of linagliptin.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In a diabetic mouse model, the administration of a combination of metformin (an anti-diabetic drug 
that improves hyperglycaemia by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis) and linagliptin had a superior 
and additive effect on glycaemic control compared to the respective monotherapies.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Oral bioavailability of linagliptin appeared to be moderate in mice (18-44%), rats (51-55%) and 
monkeys (41-69%). The volume of distribution at steady state is high in all species (>4 l/kg), which 
suggests extensive tissue distribution. The clearance differs between species, varying from 16 
(monkey) to 77 ml/min/kg (mouse). The terminal half-lives were long in all species (>10 h), except for 
the DPP-4 knockout mice and DPP-4 deficient rats, that showed short terminal half-lives of 
approximately 2-4h. After oral administration of 5 or 15 mg/kg linagliptin in mice, AUC0-∞ and C max 
increased more than proportionally with dose. This indicates non-linear mechanisms in the 
pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in mice in this dose range. Non-linear pharmacokinetic behaviour of 
linagliptin was also observed in rats and rabbits, which may be due to a concentration dependency of 
linagliptin plasma protein binding due to DPP-4 binding saturation. Toxicokinetic studies showed some 
plasma accumulation of linagliptin in rat and dog plasma after repeated dosing. 
Page 11/84
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The binding of linagliptin to plasma proteins is high at concentrations of about 1 nM (>99%). The 
plasma protein binding is concentration dependent, since the binding is lower (70-85%) when 
concentrations are about 30 nM or higher. This observed concentration-dependency was shown to be 
due to saturation of binding to DPP-4. The blood-plasma ratio at 300 nM [14C]linagliptin was ~1 in rats 
and ~0.6 in dogs, monkeys and humans. After administration of 1 nM [14C]linagliptin, the blood-
plasma ratio was much lower (~0.09 in rats and ~0.05 in monkeys). This concentration dependency is 
probably due to the binding to plasma DPP-4. Linagliptin is mainly located in plasma, especially at 
therapeutic plasma levels, giving no cause to expect extensive binding to erythrocytes. [14C]linagliptin-
related radioactivity was extensively distributed in rats and was present in all organs examined, except 
in the brain and spinal cord. The PK of linagliptin was markedly dependent on binding to DPP4. 
Accordingly, linagliptin showed a remarkably slow off-kinetics of linagliptin from DPP4 in vitro. 
Linagliptin-related material does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Maximum concentrations were seen 
30 minutes post-dose for all tissues, with highest concentrations in liver and kidneys. Measurable 
concentrations were found 168 hours post-dose in liver, spleen, thymus, Harder´s gland, lung, salivary 
gland, epididymis, adrenal, skin and bone marrow. In the kidney, a significant retention of radioactivity 
was observed for the cortex region and especially for the zona intermedia. During chronic use of 
linagliptin, steady state in tissue will be achieved quickly once DPP-4 is saturated. Therefore, only 
limited accumulation in tissue is expected to occur. Linagliptin crosses the placenta barrier in rats and 
rabbits. Fetal exposure in rats reached about 50% of the maternal exposure, whereas 2-5% was found 
in foetuses of rabbits. 
Metabolism 
Linagliptin was metabolised by CYP3A4. The in vitro metabolism of linagliptin was very low in human 
liver microsomes and human hepatocytes. Of the seven metabolites, two were formed at quantifiable 
amount, namely oxidation in the quinazoline moiety and CD1790. Cynomolgus monkey showed the 
highest extent of metabolism, followed by the female rabbit, the mouse and the rat. In humans after 
oral administration, metabolic clearance pathways of linagliptin only contributed to a minor extent to 
its overall disposition and elimination. Overall, the in vivo metabolism of linagliptin showed that 
qualitative metabolite profiles across the non-clinical species did not differ substantially and that only 
the relative proportions of the minor metabolites did vary. However, the metabolism in humans was 
slightly different from that in the pre-clinical species. The human metabolite M650(1) was not observed 
in animal plasma but in bile and faeces of the Cynomolgus monkey. The human metabolite  M665(8) 
was not observed in the animal species. The peak of M665(8) and M650(1) was present for 5.5% in 
human plasma, but the contribution of the separate metabolites was not investigated by the applicant. 
Furthermore, metabolite m4 was observed in human plasma and in mouse and rat only in the faeces 
and not in plasma. In addition metabolite M515(1) was observed as single peak in human metabolism 
studies, but only as co-elution with M476(1) in the pre-clinical species studies. The peak of the 
M531(2), M490(1) and M506(1) and the peak of M665(8) and M650(1) was observed in humans, but 
this specific peak combination was not observed in the pre-clinical species. Adequate exposure of 
animal species of safety testing to the major human metabolite CD1790 was shown. Therefore, 
potential effects of general toxicity, carcinogenicity and teratogenicity that may be caused by the 
presence of CD1790 as a human circulating metabolite were covered by non-clinical safety testing.  
Humans obviously produce many conjugated metabolites whereas in monkey unconjugated ones are 
frequent. So it is conceivable that the human metabolites are conjugates of the monkey metabolites. 
M650(1) was indeed identified as glucuronic acid conjugate of CD1790, the major human metabolite. 
M665(8) was characterized as glucuronic acid conjugate of the oxidation products of linagliptin 
Page 12/84
 
 
 
 
 
M489(1-5) in animals. Thus, both are conjugation products of metabolites and are not expected to be 
toxic. M4 could not directly be characterized with respect to chemical structures due to very low 
concentrations in the sample material with high matrix burden and ionization suppression effects. 
However, HPLC retention time data allowed a correlation to corresponding animal metabolites and can 
be considered sufficient. The absolute concentration of m4 after a dose of 10 mg linagliptin in pooled 
plasma samples was very low (0.7 nM). Based on these findings a toxic effect of m4 at these low 
concentrations is very unlikely. 
Excretion 
The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in mice, rat, rabbit and monkey following oral and 
IV administration was via faeces with a minor contribution eliminated in urine (<30%). A considerable 
fraction of the faecally excreted radioactivity can be assigned to biliary excretion (up to 46% of dose 
within 6 h in mice, 38-43% of dose within 6 h in rats, 5% of dose within 4 h in rabbits and 27% of 
dose within 6 h in monkeys). The applicant claimed that linagliptin becomes secreted into the gut as 
parent drug, but does not undergo entero-hepatic recirculation to a major extent. As a reason it was 
suggested inhibition of linagliptin absorption by bile components. If so, it could be expected that a fat-
rich meal also impairs bio-availability of linagliptin but this was not observed. The studies performed 
on biliary secretion of linagliptin employed a test system that was too artificial to discriminate between 
these possibilities. However, since knowing the exact mechanism would have no consequences for 
therapeutic use of linagliptin no further studies are required. 
[14C]linagliptin-derived material was excreted in milk, the concentration in milk was about 4-fold 
higher than in maternal plasma 1 h after administration. About 90-95% of the radioactivity was 
accounted to the parent compound. The remaining radioactivity (5-10%) excreted via milk was 
distributed over 7 minor metabolites. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Linagliptin was a competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). In addition, linagliptin is a 
weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/3A5. Clinical relevance of the MAO-B and CYP3A4/3A5 inhibition is unlikely, 
because the therapeutic plasma levels of linagliptin are in the low nanomolar range and the IC 50 value 
is in the micromolar range. The inactive metabolite, CD1790, is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and 
a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. However, it is considered unlikely 
that inhibition of CYP isozymes under in vivo human conditions would occur, because the therapeutic 
plasma levels of linagliptin are in the low nanomolar range and the IC50 value is in the micromolar 
range. Linagliptin is not an inducer of hepatic CYP. The CYP induction potential of CD1790 was not 
investigated, but in vivo study in rats administered linagliptin did not show biologically relevant 
changes of CYP activity. Therefore, it is unlikely that the major human metabolite is a CYP inducer. 
Linagliptin is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP2, OATP8, OCTN1, OCT1 and 
OATP2. Given the micromolar concentrations of linagliptin that are needed for inhibition a relevant 
drug-drug interaction is very unlikely under clinical use of linagliptin in humans. 
Linagliptin hardly penetrated into the brain, obviously mainly due to the action of P-gp. This would 
imply that in case of P-gp inhibition by concomitantly administered drugs penetration of linagliptin into 
the brain is conceivable. Based on the discussion and literature provided by the applicant, only very 
low concentrations of around 1 nM at steady state levels in humans will be reached in brain interstitial 
fluid. Taking into account the high concentrations needed to inhibit CNS receptors in vitro, no adverse 
reactions at a CNS level are expected.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Oral acute toxicity studies in mice and rats were repeated with a different batch of linagliptin due to 
differences in the impurity profile between the batches used in early toxicological investigations and 
the one produced for an early clinical study.  
The acute toxicity of linagliptin in mice and rats was low as indicated by a maximum non-lethal dose of 
≤1000 mg/kg. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract were identified as the principal target organs of toxicity in mice 
and rats at high doses of linagliptin at repeat doses (≥100 mg/kg/day, >300x Maximum 
Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) based on AUC). In rats also effects on reproductive organs, 
thyroid and the lymphoid organs were seen (≥60 mg/kg/day, >150x MRHD). No relevant and 
consistent gender differences were observed. 
Strong pseudo-allergic reactions were observed in dogs at medium doses (≥15 mg/kg/day, 450x 
clinical C max), secondarily causing cardiovascular changes, which were considered dog-specific. 
Therefore, no further repeat-dose testing has been performed with dogs. 
At high doses of linagliptin (>1000x MRHD, based on AUC) liver, kidneys, stomach, reproductive 
organs, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were target organs of toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys. At 
medium dose (>100x MRHD) irritation of the stomach is the major finding. No important gender 
difference is observed. Necrotic skin lesions, which were observed after administration of other DPP-4 
inhibitors, were not seen. The NOAEL of the longer oral toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys is 10 
mg/kg/day (40-66x MRHD). 
Intravenous administration of linagliptin to Cynomolgus monkeys at high dose (40 mg/kg/day), was 
associated with first degree atrioventricular block and signs indicative of pseudo-allergy. Because there 
was no relationship between the signs of pseudo-allergy and histamine plasma concentrations, this 
effect was not as clear as in dogs. Also this route of administration will not be used in human therapy; 
therefore, these findings will not be relevant for human use. 
Genotoxicity  
Linagliptin did not show a genotoxic potential up to toxic concentration or dosage levels when tested in 
bacterial and mammalian systems. 
The potential genotoxicity of the main metabolite CD 1790 of linagliptin was also assessed in the Ames 
test and in the chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes. In these in vitro assays the 
racemate CD 1750, which contains 50% of the S-enantiomer CD 1790 and 50% of the R-enantiomer, 
was used. 
No specific in vivo test with CD 1790 was performed as this metabolite is present in all animal species 
used for toxicological testing. In the rat the plasma levels of CD 1790 was about 3-5% compared to 
the parent compound linagliptin based on AUC. In the rat bone marrow micronucleus test (U04-1827), 
in which dosages of up to 600 mg/kg/day of linagliptin were administered, an exposure of 
approximately 20000 nM.h CD 1790 (corresponding to 1000-fold clinical exposure of CD 1790) was 
calculated. It can therefore be concluded that CD 1790 is also negative in the rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay. 
Page 14/84
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term studies 
In the 2-year carcinogenic mouse study, linagliptin did not induce carcinogenic effects, except for a 
significant increase in malignant lymphomas in females. This was attributed to a high background of 
lymphomas in mice. Because linagliptin is not genotoxic and lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen and 
thymus was not increased in female mice, it was concluded that this finding is not relevant for humans. 
Oral administration of linagliptin up to 60 mg/kg/day to Wistar rats for 2 years revealed no evidence of 
a carcinogenic potential. A dosage of 60 mg/kg/day corresponds to 418-times clinical exposure for 
linagliptin and 185-times clinical exposure for the main metabolite CD 1790 at MRHD. 
Short or medium-term studies 
No short-term studies were performed. Dose selection was based on the results of the repeated-dose 
toxicity studies. 
The CHMP considered this appropriate. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
The NOAEL in rats for fertility and early embryonic development is found at 240 mg/kg/day (943x 
MRHD, based on AUC value of study U06-1637). 
Embryo-fœtal development 
No teratogenic effects occurred in Wistar rats up to and including the high dose of 240 mg/kg/day 
linagliptin (943x MRHD). The NOAEL for both maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity was 30 
mg/kg/day (49x MRHD). 
No teratogenic effects were observed in Himalayan rabbits up to and including the high dose of 150 
mg/kg/day (1943x MRHD). A NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day (78x MRHD) was derived for embryo-foetal 
toxicity. For maternal toxicity the NOAEL was 4 mg/kg/day (2.1x MRHD). 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Linagliptin produced maternal toxicity in rats at 300 mg/kg/day (1506x MRHD). At this dosage, there 
was also an influence of linagliptin on body weight and body weight development of the offspring. The 
offspring's fertility however was not changed. The NOAEL if linagliptin in rats for both maternal and 
offspring toxicity, was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day (49x MRHD). 
In conclusion, the results from the reproductive toxicity studies do not indicate a reproductive risk to 
the foetus, suckling neonate or to adults at doses of linagliptin with very high safety margins and well 
above maternal toxicity levels. Therefore, it is considered that linagliptin is unlikely to affect 
reproduction at therapeutic exposures in humans. 
Local tolerance 
To evaluate the tolerance for linagliptin as an injection solution, several studies were performed. 
Injectable solutions (0.5 mg/mL) of linagliptin were well tolerated after a single paravenous, intra-
arterial, intravenous, or intramuscular injection. Linagliptin was also well tolerated subsequent to 
Page 15/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
topical application on rabbit skin. In an ex vivo study, injectable solutions (0.5 mg/mL) of linagliptin 
induced no relevant hemolysis in human blood. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No antigenicity studies have been performed. This was considered acceptable. 
Toxicity in juvenile animals  
No studies on juvenile toxicity have been performed, because the product is not intended for < 18 year 
old humans. 
The CHMP considered this to be acceptable. 
Immunotoxicity 
The applicant did not perform additional immunotoxicity studies, because changes in immune related 
tissues like thymus, bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes occurred only at very high dosages and are 
considered secondary to other toxicity and not due to a direct effect of linagliptin on the immune 
system. The absence of an immunotoxic potential of linagliptin is further demonstrated by the chronic 
toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies. 
Impurities 
Impurities were present in varying amounts, ranging from < 0.05 to 0.68%. All impurities were in 
sufficient excess of the human exposure in the toxicity tests, resulting in acceptable safety factors 
(>100x MRHD). All impurities were properly tested and no safety concern is evident. 
Photosafety 
Linagliptin has a second absorption maximum at a wavelength of greater than 290 nm (U09-1738). 
Therefore, the phototoxic potential of linagliptin was evaluated in clinical setting.  This was considered 
acceptable. 
Pseudo-allergy 
The most prominent finding in the toxicity studies in dogs was drug-induced hypersensitivity. This 
finding was classified as a pseudo-allergic reaction as it became apparent without prior sensitization. 
The reaction was associated with significantly increased plasma histamine levels and was clearly dose-
related. In the 2-week dose range finding study in the dog (U04-2187), pseudo-allergy was seen at 
dosages of 15 mg/kg/day or higher. In the 4-week dog study (U05-1944) a dosage of 9 mg/kg/day 
was derived as no effect level. The exposure was 210-fold above clinically relevant plasma levels. A 
high amount of impurities did not alter the pseudo-allergic reaction. Neither clinical signs of pseudo-
allergy nor increased plasma histamine concentration were observed in Cynomolgus monkeys at oral 
dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day and in Rhesus monkeys up to 150 mg/kg.  
Studies results indicate that pseudo-allergy by linagliptin is of no relevance for humans.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A PEC surfacewater of 0.025 µg/L was calculated using the default Fpen of 0.01. Since the PECsurfacewater 
exceeded the threshold value of 0.01 μg/L, a phase II ERA was performed.  
The outcome of the phase II assessment shows that the PEC/PNEC ratios for all three compartments 
are clearly below the trigger values of 1 and 0.1, respectively (see table 7).

Therefore, the use of linagliptin as active ingredient with the use pattern as given above can be 
considered to result in insignificant environmental risk for the three aquatic compartments (surface 
water, groundwater and sediment). Thus, an extended environmental fate and effects analysis for the 
three compartments in Tier B is considered to be not necessary. 
Since the log K ow of the undissociated compound was determined to be below 3 (1.7), linagliptin is 
considered to have a no potential to bioaccumulate. Therefore, bioconcentration does not have to be 
considered in Tier B. 
The OECD 106 adsorption study was conducted with three different soils and two sewage sludges. The 
study shows that the normalisation to the organic carbon (OC) content of the soils/sludges is not 
feasible due to the lack of direct correlation between adsorption of the substance and the OC content 
of the soils/sludges. Therefore, a Kd-trigger for sludge of 3700 L/kg (corresponding to the Koc-trigger 
of 10000 L/kg assuming a default OC content in sludge) is considered to be more reasonable than the 
Koc-trigger as proposed in the EMEA guideline. 
For the sludges, the OECD 106 adsorption study resulted in a Kd of 190 L/kg. Since this is below the 
trigger of 3700 L/kg, a terrestrial risk assessment was not considered in Tier B. 
The criterion for significant shifting to the sediment (10% of the substance at any time point after or at 
14 days is present in sediment) is exceeded for linagliptin. Therefore, effects on sediment organisms 
were considered in Tier B and a toxicity study on chironomids was conducted. Since the PEC/PNEC 
ratio is below the trigger of 1, it can be concluded that the use of linagliptin as active ingredient with 
the use pattern as given above can be considered to result in insignificant environmental risk for the 
compartment sediment. 
No adverse environmental effects resulting from the excipients of the product are expected, taking into 
account the expected maximum release to the environment resulting from the intended application of 
Trajenta.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the development and marketing authorization the applicant has used a variety of animal 
species, i.e. mice, diabetic/obese mice, rats, diabetic rats, rabbits, minipigs, dogs and monkeys. In in 
vitro data the sensitivity to linagliptin was similar in all species. The applicant scientifically justified this 
variety of animal species which was used to support the development and marketing authorization of 
linagliptin. The applicant explained that the healthy rodents could have been adequate, but the 
intended use of linagliptin in Type 2 diabetes patients led to the use of diabetic rodents models. The 
applicant also clarified why there was a change from dog to monkey in the chronic toxicological 
Page 18/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies, because of the pseudo-allergy observed in dogs. The applicant underlined the adequacy of the 
monkeys because of the skin lesions observed with other gliptins. The applicant is aware of the 
importance of the 3R’s (Replace, Refine and Reduce) in developing a compound, although from a 
hindsight view other choices could have been made.  
In several animal tissues and in human plasma, traces of covalently bound material has been found. 
Also N-acetyl-cystein conjugate (mercapturate) has been found in mice, monkeys and humans. These 
data indicate that linagliptin may be converted into a reactive intermediate, which can bind covalently 
to proteins, resulting in a hapten. Thus, an idiosyncratic reaction will be possible. As idiosyncratic 
reactions, the applicant has proposed the medical concepts of drug induced liver injury, acute renal 
failure and blood dyscrasia. Search in clinical trials did not reveal any drug induced liver injury or renal 
failure. There were other explanations for the patients with agranulocytose (1), bone marrow failure 
(1), leukopenia (2). There were two patients with platelet count decrease; in one of these the platelet 
count was already low at baseline, and there were no further AEs with a close time proximity. There 
were no AEs affecting two different haematological cell lines. Furthermore, safety laboratory 
parameters did no show an effect of linagliptin towards a reduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, 
or platelets. Although the CHMP agreed with the applicant that the data do not provide evidence that 
treatment with linagliptin contributes to an increased risk of drug-induced liver injury, acute renal 
failure, or blood dyscrasia, it was concerned that the experience is too small to detect this type of 
adverse effects. Therefore “Idiosyncratic adverse reactions” were included in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
The single- and repeated-dose toxicology studies on general toxicity revealed that linagliptin is well 
tolerated up to high doses. At very high doses toxicity towards several different organs becomes 
obvious with no clear underlying mechanism. This is in line with the findings on other DPP-4 inhibitors 
and could be related to loss of DPP-4 selectivity at high doses. Some DPP-4 inhibitors caused skin 
lesions in monkeys which may be attributed to off-target DPP-8/DPP-9 inhibition. No skin lesions were 
observed with linagliptin, suggesting that linagliptin did not inhibit DPP-8/DPP-9 in in vitro assays.  
A slight but consistent elongation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval of the ECG was found in the 
repeated-dose studies in high-dose male dogs (around 36-time human therapeutic exposure). Effects 
on heart rate and blood pressure were seen at around 5-time human therapeutic exposure, the 
underlying mechanism being unclear. Toxicity of linagliptin could be enhanced by co-administration of 
a P-gp inhibitor due to the fact that part of the absorbed drug becomes immediately secreted back in 
the gut lumen by P-gp (see Pharmacokinetic section). This effect is not related to DPP-4 inhibitors and 
was not observed with other DPP-4 inhibitors. 
All studies on genotoxicity with linagliptin and its main metabolite CD 1790 (tested in the racemate CD 
1750) were negative. Linapliptin is therefore considered to be devoid of any relevant genotoxic 
potential. All specified and identified potential impurities have been sufficiently qualified for their 
genotoxic potential. According to the applicant identified genotoxic impurities are well below TTC based 
on the evaluation of the synthesis process. 
Considering the available data, linagliptin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies show that linagliptin has appropriate pharmacology and toxicology for the 
intended clinical use.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The linagliptin clinical development program comprised a total of 24 phase I trials, 4 phase II trials and 
9 phase III trials (with treatment periods between 12 and 78 weeks). In total, 4,687 patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus and 453 healthy volunteers received treatment with linagliptin. Of these, 3,692 
patients were treated for at least 24 weeks, 2,474 patients for at least 52 weeks, and 536 patients for 
more than 78 weeks. Overall, 44.3% of patients were recruited in Europe, 40.2% in Asia, 9.3% in 
North America, and 6.2% in South America.

Initial scientific advice was sought from the CHMP on 16 May 2007 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/ 
385760/2007). Subsequently, the clinical program was revised and a follow-up Scientific Advice was 
sought on 23 April 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/ SAWP/311988/2008). The emphasis of the advice was on the 
design features of the phase III trials, particularly dosing, the adequacy of the safety database, and 
the non-inferiority margin in the active-controlled 1218.20 trial. The suggestions of the CHMP were 
subsequently addressed and the clinical development program was adjusted to a certain extent. 
For linagliptin, the CHMP "Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus" is applicable. In general, the applicant has followed this guideline. 
The claimed indication for Trajenta was: 
“Trajenta is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control: 
  when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin 
 
 
 
 
is inappropriate. 
in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus a sulphonylurea alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate . 
in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy 
with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
in combination with a thiazolidinedione, when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, 
does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of a thiazolidinedione is 
considered appropriate.” 
The approved indication and posology are the following: 
“Trajenta is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in 
adults: 
as monotherapy 
 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal impairment. 
as combination therapy 
 
 
in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy 
with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
“Posology 
The dose of linagliptin is 5 mg once daily. When linagliptin is added to metformin, the dose of 
metformin should be maintained, and linagliptin administered concomitantly. 
When linagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may 
be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4) 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
For patients with renal impairment, no dose adjustment for Trajenta is required.  
Page 22/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic 
impairment but clinical experience in such patients is lacking. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary based on age. 
However, clinical experience in patients > 75 years of age is limited. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of linagliptin in children and adolescents has not yet been established. No data 
are available.” 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
After oral administration of a 5 mg dose, linagliptin is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring 1.5 to 2.5 hours post dose (median tmax), suggesting pre-dominant 
absorption in the upper intestine.  
Linagliptin has an oral systemic bioavailability of 30% and a moderate permeability. Additionally, 
linagliptin is a highly soluble drug. Therefore, linagliptin can be considered a Class 3 drug substance 
according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS).  
Food-interaction studies 
The effect of a high fat, high caloric meal on the pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg single dose of linagliptin 
administered as a tablet was investigated in study 1218.34.  
Intake of food prolonged the time to reach maximum plasma concentrations by 2 hours and lowered 
the Cmax by 15%. No influence on the AUC0-72 was observed. The other pharmacokinetic parameters 
of linagliptin were comparable under fasted and fed conditions. The decrease of the Cmax of linagliptin 
has no clinical relevance as the pharmacodynamic targets were reached at these plasma levels. 
Therefore, it was concluded that linagliptin can be administered with and without food.  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of linagliptin in human plasma is concentration-dependent, decreasing from 
98.8% at 2 nM to 83% at 20 nM. Consequently the protein unbound fraction of linagliptin in plasma 
increases with increasing total plasma concentrations. This is probably reflecting the saturation of 
binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentrations of linagliptin. As a result, linagliptin shows non-linear 
distribution kinetics both after oral and intravenous administration. After single oral administration of 5 
mg linagliptin the apparent volume of distribution, Vz/F was approximately 12700 L.  
Page 23/84
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
After an oral dose of 5 mg linagliptin, plasma concentrations decline in at least a bi-phasic manner with 
a long terminal half-life. The initial rapid decline mainly represents the distribution of the drug into a 
large peripheral compartment and the fast elimination of non-DPP-4 bound linagliptin. Once 
concentrations drop to a magnitude within the range of plasma DPP-4 concentrations, a long terminal 
phase (terminal half-life for linagliptin up to 200 hours) is observed. This is assumed to be related to 
the tight binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and the slow dissociation of the linagliptin-DPP-4 complex. Thus 
it is expected that the terminal half life does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The 
accumulation half-life of linagliptin, as determined from accumulation after oral administration of 
multiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is 11.4 hours. Linagliptin shows a dose–dependent apparent total 
clearance at steady-state. After repeated oral administration of a 5 mg dose CL/F,ss is 1120 mL/min 
and renal clearance was 70 mL/min. 
The parent compound was excreted unchanged in urine and faeces with 76% (61% out of 81%) of 
excreted radioactivity after intravenous dosing and with 90% (78% out of 87%) of excreted 
radioactivity after oral dosing. All metabolites contributed to less than 10 % of the excreted 
radioactivity. In plasma, CD 1790 was identified as major metabolite with 16.9% of sample 
radioactivity in pooled samples after oral administration. Other metabolites found in humans showed 
exposure levels well below 10% of linagliptin plasma exposure. Linagliptin is metabolised mainly by 
CYP3A4. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linagliptin AUC ss and C max,ss increased less than proportionally with dose after multiple dose 
administration of single tablets with dose strengths of 1 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg. This is of minor 
importance as only the 5 mg tablet will be marketed.  
Intra-individual variability was not specifically determined. 
No specific studies were performed investigating time dependency. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of single and multiple 5 mg doses of 
linagliptin tablets in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (RI) in comparison to subjects 
with normal renal function was investigated in an open, parallel-group, phase I trial (1218.26). All 
patients received 5 mg single or multiple dose once daily under fasting conditions. 
The influence of RI is only moderate for the parent compound as well as for the main metabolite. The 
increase in exposure in severe renal impairment is less than 2 -fold and the exposure in T2DM patients 
with severe renal impairment is comparable with “healthy” impaired patients. 
Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the recommendation included in the SmPC that no dose adjustment in 
these patients is considered necessary. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The influence of impaired hepatic functions was investigated in study 1218.27. The pharmacokinetics 
of linagliptin was only slightly influenced by reduction of the hepatic functions. Only exposure to the 
Page 24/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
main metabolite was significantly reduced, however, as the elimination of linagliptin by metabolism is 
small (less than 13%), this reduction in exposure is of no clinical relevancy. 
The CHMP endorsed the proposed text in the SmPC that no dose reduction is considered necessary in 
patients with hepatic impairment.  
Gender/weight 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, in which 459 patients were involved, the influence of 
gender and weight was considered of no clinical relevancy. The difference in exposure was not more 
than 9% higher in female than in male subjects.  The influence of weight was less than 20%, and 
therefore not clinical relevant. 
Race 
As linagliptin is mainly excreted unchanged in the faeces, large difference between races are not 
expected based on differences in expression of enzymes. Differences may occur due to variability in 
the volume of distribution as this is rather high for linagliptin. This may explain the 30% higher Cmax 
in Japanese subjects.  
Age 
The influence of age on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is only investigated in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. In this analysis 459 patients were involved. The mean age in this analysis 
was 60 years. Clinically there was an increase in adverse events with increased age observed. This 
increase in adverse events can not be explained by an increase in exposure in this group of patients. A 
special pharmacokinetic study on the influence of age is considered not necessary. 
The CHMP endorsed the proposed text in the SmPC that no dose adjustment is necessary for the 
elderly population. 
No PK is available in children; however PK studies in this population are foreseen as part of the PIP for 
this product. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro data indicate that linagliptin is a substrate for CYP3A4 and P-gp, OATP8-, OCT2-, OAT4-, 
OCTN1- and OCTN2. No relevant inhibition of CYPs or transporter proteins at clinically plausible 
concentrations of linagliptin or its major metabolite CD1790 was found. Furthermore, no hints on 
enzyme induction (CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4) were found in human hepatocytes. 
Effects of other medicinal products on linagliptin pharmacokinetics 
Co-administration of linagliptin with ritonavir, strong P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in 2-fold increase 
in exposure and 3-fold increase in Cmax. This was explained by an increase in bioavailability due to 
inhibition of P-gp, while there was a small effect of ritonavir on the elimination of linagliptin. Due to the 
wide safety margin of linagliptin, up to 2-fold increases in exposure in total concentrations of linagliptin 
with concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors is considered acceptable, particularly if the increased 
exposure is only transient. However, the unbound concentrations, which are usually less than 1% at 
the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4-5-fold after co-administration with ritanovir. These 
changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, 
clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Page 25/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-treatment with rifampicin, a potent P-gp/CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in a decrease of 40% in 
linagliptin exposure and a decrease in relative exposure of the CYP3A4 formed metabolite CD 1790, 
which is explained by induction of P-gp. The reduction in linagliptin exposure is time dependent 
suggesting that full efficacy of linagliptin in combination with strong P-gp inducers might not be 
achieved, particularly if these are administed long-term. Co-administration with other potent inducers 
of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin has not been 
studied. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Effects of linagliptin on other medicinal products 
In vitro data indicate no risk for interactions due to inhibition of CYP450 or drug transporter proteins 
by linagliptin. This was confirmed by clinical studies, where linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, pioglitazone, warfarin, simvastatin, digoxin or oral 
contraceptives.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Linagliptin was found to be a weak competitor inhibitor and a weak to moderate mechanism based 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. Considering the therapeutic plasma concentrations of linagliptin, a clinical 
relevance of this finding is unlikely. There was no inhibition in vitro of any of the other CYP isoenzymes 
under investigation by linagliptin (i.e., CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 4A11). 
The major metabolite, CD 1790, was found to be a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and a mechanism-
based inhibitor of CYP3A4. Considering maximum plasma concentrations of CD 1790, a clinically 
relevant CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 mediated interaction is unlikely. 
Finally, no hints on enzyme induction (CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4) were found in human hepatocytes. 
Therefore, linagliptin is not an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics were studied in 11 phase I/II trials, including healthy volunteers, subjects with 
T2DM and special populations (renally or hepatically impaired patients, Japanese subjects). 
Mechanism of action 
Mechanism of action is DPP-4 inhibition. Nutrient intake stimulates the secretion of the gastrointestinal 
incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide 
(GIP), both of which exert glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects and assist pancreatic insulin and 
glucagon in maintaining glucose homeostasis.  GLP-1 lowers blood glucose levels by augmenting the 
glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, GLP-1 inhibits glucagon secretion, slows gastric 
emptying, and induces satiety. The plasma half-life of GLP-1 is limited to a few minutes because of 
rapid proteolytic degradation by the enzyme DPP-4. Inhibition of DPP-4 prolongs the half-life of active 
GLP-1 and thereby increases plasma insulin levels and lowers plasma glucose levels. Since GLP-1 
activity ceases when the glucose concentration falls below 55 mg/dL, prolongation of the half-life of 
GLP-1 by DPP-4 inhibitors bears little risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Inhibition of DPP-4 was considered the most relevant biomarker for the effectiveness of linagliptin. A 
median DPP-4 inhibition of 80% at trough was assumed as a threshold based on published data. 
Plasma glucose and active GLP-1 were other markers for effectiveness. Exploratory biomarkers 
Page 26/84
 
 
 
 
 
included glucagon, C-peptide, insulin, fructosamine, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol and glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c). 
DPP-4 inhibition was measured in 10 of the PD-studies, after multiple dosing of linagliptin (1 mg, 2.5 
mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) to T2DM patients and healthy volunteers. Trough median DPP-4 inhibition was 
>80% in patients receiving 5 mg linagliptin once daily. Doses of 1 mg and 2.5 mg were less effective, 
whereas higher doses did not result in a considerable larger median DPP-4 inhibition. A consistent DPP-
4 inhibition of >80% at trough with 5 mg linagliptin was also seen in Japanese, as well as in Caucasian 
and Japanese healthy volunteers. On basis of these results 5 mg was chosen as therapeutic dose. 
The magnitude of steady-state DPP-4 inhibition was not altered by concomitant dosing of metformin, 
or renal or hepatic impairment. However, concomitant treatment with rifampicin resulted in a decrease 
of DPP-4 inhibition, with trough levels of 53% inhibition. This is in line with pharmacokinetic data, 
which showed a reduction in AUC and Cmax of linagliptin when combined with rifampicin. Therefore, a 
decrease in efficacy of linagliptin can be expected when patients are treated with rifampicin 
concomitantly or more generally with a potent P-gp inducer. This is expressed in the SmPC. 
Generally linagliptin plasma concentrations correlated well with DPP-4 activity/inhibition. 
Results on secondary parameters as active GLP-1, glucose, insulin and glucagon were consistent with 
the primary parameter. However, there was no clear difference in effect between 2.5 mg and 5 mg 
dose. 
Fructosamine was measured in some early linagliptin trials (studies 1218.2 and 1218.3). However, 
fructosamine was generally highly variable, and measurements of fructosamine were not included in 
studies of longer duration. Instead, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol was measured, as it was regarded to be a 
better marker of glucose control over an intermediate (up to 2 weeks) time period. In study 1218.37, 
treatment with 5 mg linagliptin over 4 weeks resulted in a statistical significant increase of 1,5-AG 
concentrations of 1.8 μg/mL (p<0.0001) compared to placebo (1.0 μg/mL vs. -0.8 μg/mL) and thus 
indicate that glucose excursions during linagliptin treatment are reduced. The concentration of 10 
mcg/dL at week 4 also indicates that nearly no glucose excursions above 180 mg/dL occurred, as this 
was found to be the reference value in optimally controlled patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Additionally, a thorough QTc study (1218.32) evaluated the effect of 5 mg linagliptin, 100 mg 
linagliptin, placebo and positive control (moxifloxacin 400 mg) on QT prolongation. There was no 
clinically relevant increase in the QTcI interval following administration of 5 mg and 100 mg linagliptin 
compared with placebo.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Generally, linagliptin plasma concentrations correlated well with DPP-4 activity/inhibition. This 
relationship was comparable in Caucasian and in Japanese subjects and was not relevantly influenced 
by renal or hepatic impairment, or by concomitant administration of metformin. Ritonavir, a potent P-
gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor increased linagliptin exposure 2-fold.  Due to the wide safety margin of linagliptin, 
up to 2-fold increases in exposure in total concentrations of linagliptin with concomitant use of P-
gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors is considered acceptable, particularly if the increased exposure is only transient. 
Although, the unbound concentrations were increased 4-5-fold after co-administration with ritanovir, it 
was considered not be a safety concern. 
Rifampicin, as a potent P-gp inducer, decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC by 40% and DPP-4 
inhibition by 30%. Therefore, co-administration of linagliptin and a potent P-gp inducer might result in 
lower efficacy of linagliptin. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Page 27/84
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamics of linagliptin were studied in 11 Phase I/II trials. DPP-4 inhibition >80% over 
24h was achieved with multiple dosing of 5 mg linagliptin. Lower doses were less effective, whereas 
higher doses did not result in a considerable larger median DPP-4 inhibition. On basis of these results 5 
mg was chosen as therapeutic dose. Results on secondary parameters as active GLP-1, glucose, insulin 
and glucagon were consistent with the primary parameter. However, there was no clear difference in 
effect between 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose. 
Although age has been investigated as covariate, the number of very elderly subjects > 75 yrs in all 
clinical studies was small, and pharmacodynamics have not been studied in very elderly patients apart 
from a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. 
In a thorough QT study, single doses of 5 mg or 100 mg linagliptin did not prolong QT interval of the 
ECG. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linagliptin have been studied extensively, and the choice 
of 5 mg as therapeutic dose appears to be reasonable from a pharmacodynamic point of view.  
Linagliptin did not prolong QT interval of the ECG.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
Eleven phase II/III studies with different trial designs, different durations of treatment, and different 
antidiabetic background medications were used for the evaluation of efficacy and safety of linagliptin. 
In these 11 studies, 4278 patients were assigned to linagliptin (any dose), and 3872 to linagliptin 5 
mg. A total of 1117 patients received placebo and 1073 patients an active comparator.  
The Phase III program for linagliptin examined the efficacy of linagliptin in monotherapy use and in 
combination use with 3 important antihyperglycaemic medications: metformin, sulfonylurea (SU) and a 
PPARγ agonist (pioglitazone). These combinations were expected to be clinically valuable given 
potentially complementary mechanisms of action—adding agents that target in insulin resistance 
and/or excessive hepatic glucose production (a PPARγ agonist or metformin)—with linagliptin, an agent 
that targets enhancing insulin secretion and lowering glucagon concentrations.   
Efficacy and safety of linagliptin was examined  
- as monotherapy in two studies: 1218.16 and 1218.23  
- as initial combination with pioglitazone : 1218.15  
- as add-on to an SU: 1218.35 
- as add-on to metformin: 1218.17, 1218.20 
- as add-on to metformin and a SU: 1218.18  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Three of the four provided phase II studies were dose response studies (1218.5, 1218.6 and 1218.12) 
which examined linagliptin in doses from 0.5 to 10 mg given once daily. Studies 1218.5 and 1218.6 
are the main dose finding studies, whereas Study 1218.12 was a short-term supportive phase II study. 
In addition to the change from baseline in HbA1c, DPP-4 inhibition was used as parameter for selecting 
the optimum linagliptin dose for Phase III clinical development. DPP-4 inhibition is a well recognized 
biomarker for efficacy, as predicted by the mode of action. For other DPP-4 inhibitors, non-clinical 
studies showed that DPP-4 inhibition of 80% or more over 24 h was related to maximum effects in 
incretin response and glucose reduction. 
Page 28/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 1218.5 compared linagliptin doses of 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg once daily as monotherapy with 
placebo. Median DPP-4 inhibition was 38.5%, 74.5%, and 81% for the 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg 
doses, respectively. Thus, DPP-4 inhibition of 80% or more was reached only with the 5 mg dose, but 
not with the 2 lower doses. The differences between linagliptin and placebo in the adjusted mean 
changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.14% (0.5 mg), -0.41% (2.5 mg), and -0.46% (5 mg) for the 
different doses of linagliptin. Superiority over placebo was shown for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of 
linagliptin, but not for the 0.5 mg dose.  
In study 1218.6, which was performed in patients using metformin background therapy, the efficacy of 
linagliptin 1 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg once daily versus placebo was assessed. It was shown that both the 
linagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg doses provided median DPP-4 inhibition of more than 80% (85.0% and 
90.0%), whereas the 1 mg dose did not reach this target (63.0%). The treatment differences in the 
adjusted mean HbA1c changes from baseline were -0.40% (1 mg), -0.72% (5 mg), and -0.67% (10 
mg) for the different linagliptin doses; all 3 doses were shown to be superior to placebo. The HbA1c 
reductions observed in study 1218.6 were generally more pronounced than in study 1218.5. 
Overall, these results support the 5 mg dose as optimal dose to be taken forward to phase III. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
Four pivotal efficacy studies were submitted in this application (1218.15, 1218.16, 1218.17 and 
1218.18). These studies were randomized, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24 week 
efficacy studies. Randomisation was stratified by HbA1c (<8.5% versus ≥8.5%) and number of 
previous antidiabetic treatments. 
Below are described aspects that were common to all pivotal efficacy studies. 
Methods 
  Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
  Adult male and non-pregnant female patients with T2DM either on previous or no previous 
antidiabetic agent and pre-defined HbA1c values at screening and randomisation, (depending on 
previous AHA, for details see individual studies), 
  Age ≥18 to ≤80 years of age, 
  BMI ≤40 kg/m2,.  
Treatment with insulin, GLP-1 analogues/agonists, or anti-obesity drugs within past 3 months; 
diabetic ketoacidosis within past 6 months; 
Main exclusion criteria 
 
 
  heart failure NHYHA class III or IV (1218.15 only); CV event within the past 6 months, 
 
 
 
 
impaired hepatic function (ALT, AST, ALP above 3 ULN), 
FPG > 240 mg/dl(> 13.3 mmol/L), 
limitation in the degree of renal impairment in studies 1218.17 and 1218.18, 
current treatment with systemic steroids or change in dosage of thyroid hormones within 6 weeks.  
  Objectives 
The primary objective was testing the superiority hypothesis of linagliptin versus placebo (as 
monotherapy or add-on) or the non-inferiority of linagliptin versus active control in decreasing HbA1c. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in all the studies was HbA1c change from baseline to the last on-
treatment visit. 
Page 29/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary glycaemic endpoints included: FPG, proportion of patients reaching HbA1c < 7.0% or 
<6.5 % or HbA1c reduction of at least 0.5%. Some studies included a meal tolerance test (MTT, in 
study 1218.16, 1218.17).  
Other relevant endpoints included: Use of rescue therapy, change from baseline in body weight after 
24 weeks treatment (presented in safety part), change from baseline in waist circumference after 24 
weeks of treatment (presented in safety part) and change from baseline in lipid parameters after 24 
weeks of treatment (presented in safety section). 
  Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by the HbA1c value at the beginning of the placebo run-in period (<8.5% 
versus ≥8.5%). Randomisation was also stratified by the number of oral antidiabetic drugs at the time 
of enrolment in most of the trials, except for study 1218.18. 
  Blinding (masking) 
Access to the randomisation code was restricted to dedicated randomisation personnel. Neither the 
patient nor the investigator was aware of the identity of a patient’s treatment.  
  Statistical methods 
The primary statistical analysis in all pivotal studies analyzed the change from baseline in HbA1c after 
24 weeks of treatment using an ANCOVA model with 'treatment' as well as 'prior use of antidiabetic 
agents' as categorical covariates and 'baseline HbA1c' as continuous covariate. The primary analysis 
was conducted at the 2-sided 5% level of significance and based on the FAS data set. Missing data 
were imputed using LOCF and additional sensitivity analyses were performed.  
Statistical methods employed are generally considered appropriate. 
Below are described aspects that were study specific: 
Study 1218.15 
This was a study in patients with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg as initial 
combination with pioglitazone 30 mg in comparison with placebo as initial combination with 
pioglitazone 30 mg.  
Patients were treated in 43 centers in Europe and Asia: Japan (24.9%), Spain (23.1%), Hungary 
(21.9%), Romania (18.8%), Greece (6.4%), Austria (4.4%), Portugal (0.5%).  
Study period was from 15 April 2008 to 19 June 2009. 
Methods 
  Design 
Multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting of an 
open-label, 2-week placebo run-in, followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week 
follow-up after termination of study medication. 
  Study participants 
Patients with T2DM, either drug-naive or pre-treated with any antidiabetic agent as monotherapy or 
combination therapy. 
HbA 1c at screening: 7.5% to 11.0% in treatment naïve patients and 7.0% to 9.5% in pretreated 
patients. HbA1c at start of run-in: between 7.5% and 11.0%.  
Page 30/84
 
 
 
 
 
(For other inclusion and exclusion criteria see general method aspects section above). 
  Treatments 
Patients eligible after the run-in period were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to 24 weeks of treatment with 
either 5 mg linagliptin or placebo as initial combination with 30 mg pioglitazone 
(linagliptin+pioglitazone and placebo+pioglitazone, respectively).  
Results  
  Participant flow  
A total of 707 patients were enrolled and 389 were randomized (see table below). The most common 
reason for not being randomized was the HbA1c results before randomisation (42.5 %).  
     Disposition of randomised patients –Screened set  
  Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments were considered not influencing the study results. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
  Baseline data 
At study start, main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)] 
Age: 57.5 y (25-79), 25.4 % of patients were ≥ 65, 
BMI: 29.0 kg/m2 (16.8- 39.7), 42.2 % had a BMI ≥ 30,  
Diabetes duration: 25.5 % had duration of diabetes up to 1 year, 42.4% >5 years. 
Page 31/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 31.8% of the patients had taken one antidiabetic agent and 18.4% had taken ≥ 2 
antidiabetic agents. Pre-treated patients were mainly on metformin monotherapy (22.1%) or SU 
monotherapy (7.9%) or the combination of both (9.5%).  
Overall, 60.9% of patients were male, 74.6% were Caucasian and 24.9% Asian. 
  Numbers analyzed 
In both groups, over 97.0% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis and over 95% in the 
PPS analysis (see Table below). 
  Number of patients by analysis set –Randomized set 
  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Treatment with 5 mg once daily linagliptin + pioglitazone was superior to treatment with placebo + 
pioglitazone in lowering HbA1c with a statistically significant difference of −0.51%. 
The unadjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c showed similar results.  
         Adjusted means for the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at Week 24 – FAS (LOCF) 
In both treatment groups, HbA1c levels decreased until week 18 and remained stable thereafter. 
The secondary analysis PPS supports the results of the primary analysis, although the placebo adjusted 
treatment effect was smaller (mean difference [95%CI]: -0.48 [-0.69; -0.28] for HbA1c.   
Page 32/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The FAS-completers showed an even smaller placebo adjusted treatment effect (mean difference 
[95%CI]: -0.35 [-0.56; -0.14] for HbA1c.   
Adjusted mean HbA1c changes from baseline were similar between Asian and European populations (-
0.96 % vs. -1.09%, respectively), whereas placebo-adjusted changes were not (-0.91% vs. -0.37%, 
respectively). 
Secondary endpoints: 
The addition of 5 mg qd linagliptin to pioglitazone was superior to placebo in addition to pioglitazone in 
lowering FPG resulting in a treatment difference of -14.2 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L). The results were 
confirmed by the secondary FAS-completer analysis.  
A larger proportion of patients in the linagliptin + pioglitazone group achieved HbA1c levels <7% or 
<6.5% or an HbA1c reduction of at least 0.5%. 
  Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − FAS (LOCF) 
The proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy was 7.9% in the linagliptin + pioglitazone group 
and 14.1% in the placebo + pioglitazone group. The odds ratio obtained from the accompanying 
logistic regression was 0.446 (p<0.05). In addition, linagliptin + pioglitazone patients required rescue 
therapy later than placebo + pioglitazone patients. 
Other endpoints 
By week 24, both treatment groups had an increase in mean weight, with an adjusted mean change 
from baseline that was greater in the linagliptin + pioglitazone group (2.3 kg) than in the placebo + 
pioglitazone group (1.2 kg). This translated to a statistically significant treatment difference in mean 
change from baseline of 1.10 kg (p<0.05). 
Discussion of the study results 
Overall, superiority of linagliptin + pioglitazone over placebo + pioglitazone was demonstrated in the 
present study by the primary endpoint change in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment. 
However, the placebo adjusted effect of linagliptin (-0.51%) was rather modest and of borderline 
clinical relevance. The PPS analysis showed an even smaller effect (-0.48%). Clinically relevant effects 
on HbA1c were also not reached in patients on combination therapy prior to study. 
Page 33/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to differences in placebo response, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect was larger in Asian 
patients (-0.91%) than in European patients (-0.37%). The treatment effect observed in the European 
population is not considered clinically relevant. 
Linagliptin aggravated the pioglitazone-induced weight gain by a yet unknown mechanism (see safety 
section of this AR), which is clearly undesirable. 
Overall, the placebo-adjusted glucose-lowering effect of linagliptin in this study was modest and of 
borderline clinical relevance. European patients, the relevant population for this application, did not 
have a relevant placebo-adjusted improvement in glycaemic control. Considering these efficacy results 
and the observed weight gain, the combination therapy of linagliptin + pioglitazone appears 
unfavourable.  
Study 1218.16 
This was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg 
as monotherapy in comparison to placebo. Patients were treated in 66 centers in in Asia 50.1 % (with 
the highest proportion of 26.8 % in India and of 14.3 % in Malaysia) and Europe 49.9% (with the 
highest proportion of 17.7% in Ukraine and of 12.3% Slovakia).  
Study period was 15 February 2008 to 06 May 2009 
Methods 
  Design 
Multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting of an 
open-label, 2-week placebo run-in, followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week 
follow-up after termination of study medication. 
  Study participants 
Patients with T2DM, either drug-naive or pre-treated with not more than one antidiabetic agent 
(except for PPARγ agonist) with a stable dose for 10 weeks prior study.  
HbA 1c at screening: 7.0% to 10.0% in treatment naïve patients and 6.5% to 9.0% in pretreated 
patients. HbA1c at start of run-in: between 7.0% and 10.0%.  
There were no limitations in the degree of renal impairment in this study.  
(For other inclusion and exclusion criteria see general method aspects section above). 
  Treatments 
Patients eligible at start of the run-in period were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either 5 mg linagliptin or 
placebo.  
  Outcomes/endpoints  
For primary and secondary endpoints see general method section above.  
In addition, PK/PD of linagliptin (plasma concentrations at trough after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment);  
To support the analysis of renal function during the trial, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) 
was categorised according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) staging, and the 
frequency of patients with shifts in renal impairment stage was investigated. In addition, renal function 
was categorised based on the estimated creatinine clearance (eCcr) values calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula. The stages of renal function are specified in the table below.

Results  
  Participant flow  
A total of 935 patients were enrolled and 503 were randomized. The most common reason for not 
being randomized was the HbA1c at screening and before randomisation (38.2%). 
The discontinuation rates were higher in the placebo group (9%) compared with the linagliptin group 
(5.4%) without a striking difference in any specific cause.  
Disposition of randomised patients –Screened set  
  Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments were considered not influencing the study results. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
  Baseline data 
At study start, main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)] 
Age: 55.7 y (24-79), 20.9 % of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
Page 35/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMI: 29.5 kg/m2 (16.0- 41.2), 40.0 % had a BMI ≥ 30, 
Diabetes duration: 36.1% had duration of diabetes up to 1 year, 25.2% >5 years. 
A total of 56.5% of the patients had not previously taken an antidiabetic agent, 43.5% had taken one 
antidiabetic agent. Pre-treated patients were mainly on metformin monotherapy (32.3%) or SU 
monotherapy (10.9%).  
Overall, 48.3% of patients were male, 53.7% were Caucasian and 46.1% Asian. 
eGFR (MDRD staging): 43.1% of patients had an eGFR of ≥ 90 mL/min, 3.6% had 30 to <60 mL/min.  
There were no relevant differences in the mean baseline characteristics between the treatment groups.  
  Numbers analysed 
In both groups, over 97.0% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis, over 93% in the 
PPS analysis and over 90% in the FAS-completers analysis.

  Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
Treatment with 5 mg qd linagliptin was superior to treatment with placebo in lowering HbA1c with a 
statistically significant difference of −0.69% (p<0.0001). The unadjusted mean change from baseline 
in HbA1c showed similar results.

Page 36/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the linagliptin group, HbA1c levels decreased until week 12 and remained relatively stable 
thereafter. In the placebo group, HbA1c levels increased slightly over time. 
The secondary analysis PPS supports the results of the primary analysis, the placebo adjusted 
treatment effect was (mean difference [95%CI]: -0.69 [-0.86; -0.53] for HbA1c. The FAS-completers 
showed a smaller placebo adjusted treatment effect [95%CI]: -0.56 [-0.73; -39] for HbA1c.   
Whereas the mean absolute change from baseline in HbA1c was similar for Asian and Caucasian 
patients (-0.45% vs. -0.42%, respectively) the placebo-adjusted change was not (-0.91% vs. -
0.52%). 
Secondary endpoints 
The treatment of 5 mg QD linagliptin was superior to placebo in lowering FPG resulting in a mean 
treatment difference of -23.3 (3.6) mg/dL at week 24. The results were confirmed by the secondary 
FAS-completer analysis.  
A larger proportion of patients in the linagliptin compared to the placebo group achieved HbA1c levels 
< 7% or < 6.5% or HbA1c reduction ≥0.5%. 
Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − FAS (LOCF)  
Page 37/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the MTT parameters, difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in total glucose AUC at 
24 weeks between the two treatment groups was -3.26 mmol h/L with a statistically significant p-value 
of 0.0026, further supporting the results of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
The proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy was 20.9 % in the placebo group versus 10.2% 
in the linagliptin group. Based on the regression result, the odds of requiring rescue therapy was about 
3 times lower for patients treated with linagliptin compared to those taking placebo (odds ratio = 
0.316, p < 0.05). 
Other endpoints 
In patients receiving linagliptin, the median DPP-4 inhibition at trough was greater than 80% with 
84.18% at week 12 and 82.81% at week 24 and thus constant over time.  
No meaningful change in the body weight was observed in either group. The difference in the adjusted 
means of change from baseline to 24 weeks in body weight between treatment groups was 0.28 kg. 
Pharmacokinetic results  
Analysis of linagliptin plasma concentrations at trough was performed on the data with original results 
(OR). The geometric mean (gMean) plasma concentrations of linagliptin at trough remained constant 
over time. 
Mean linagliptin trough levels over time were comparable between patients with normal, mildly or 
moderately impaired renal function.  
Geometric mean trough plasma concentrations of linagliptin - FAS (OR) 
Discussion of the study results 
In the present study linagliptin at dose of 5 mg QD provided statistically significant and clinically 
relevant improvement in glycaemic control in patients with T2DM not sufficiently controlled on 
monotherapy (PPARγ agonists excluded) and in treatment naïve patients. Due to differences in placebo 
response, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect was larger in Asian patients (-0.91%) than in 
Caucasian patients (-0.52%). The results on HbA1c were supported by the results on the secondary 
endpoints. 
The data of pharmacokinetic properties in patients with mild to moderate degrees of renal insufficiency 
confirm that dose adjustment in these patients is not necessary.

Study 1218.17 
This was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg 
as add-on therapy to metformin in comparison to placebo. Patients were recruited in Asia (39.5%), 
Europe (26.1%), North America (which included Australia and New Zealand, 18.7%) and South 
America (15.7%).  
Study period was 31 January 2008 to 18 May 2009. 
Methods 
  Design 
Multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting of an 
open-label, 2-week placebo run-in, followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week 
follow-up after termination of study medication. 
  Study participants 
Patients with T2DM, pre-treated with either metformin alone or metformin in combination with one 
other antidiabetic agent (except pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, insulin) unchanged for at least 10 weeks 
prior to study. A dose of ≥1500 mg/day metformin was required for inclusion into the trial. Minimal 
required dose of metformin was 1500 mg per day unless the investigator documented patients to be 
on their maximum tolerated dose. 
HbA1c at screening: 7.0% to 10.0% in patients pre-treated on metformin alone and 6.5% to 9.0% in 
patients pre-treated on metformin in combination with one other antidiabetic agent.  
HbA1c at start of run-in: between 7.0% and 10.0%.  
  Treatments 
Patients eligible after the run-in period were randomised in 3:1 to either 5 mg linagliptin or placebo. 
  Outcome/endpoints  
For primary and secondary endpoints see general method section above.  
In addition further endpoints were: 
- MTT: change from baseline for 2-h post-prandial glucose (2hPPG), glucose AUC, insulin AUC, C-
peptide AUC, and insulin AUC to glucose AUC ratio. 
Results  
  Participant flow  
A total of 1268 patients were enrolled and 701 were randomized. The most common reason for not 
being randomized was not meeting the HbA1c criteria (36.0%). 
The premature discontinuation rates were 7.9% in the placebo group and 7.5% in the linagliptin group. 
The main reason for premature discontinuation was in both groups, refused to continue trial 
medication.

Disposition of randomised patients –Screened set  
  Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments are considered not influencing the study results.  
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
  Baseline data 
At study start, main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
Age: 56.5 y (21-79), 22.0% of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
BMI: 29.9 kg/m2 (19.1-52.3), 43.9 % had a BMI ≥ 30,  
Diabetes duration: 34.0% had duration of diabetes > 1 to 5 years, 54.9% >5 years. 
Overall, 54.1% of patients were male, 76.1% were Caucasian and 20.9% were Asian. In both 
treatment groups, around 20% of the patients were of Hispanic/Latino origin. 
Pre-treated patients were mainly on metformin monotherapy (68.6%) or on combination of metformin 
plus sulfonylurea (26.9%). 
eGFR: (MDRD staging) 59.1% of patients had an eGFR of  ≥ 90 mL/min, 37.6% had 60 to < 90 
mL/min and 3.3% had 30 to <60 mL/min. 
There were no relevant differences in baseline efficacy variables. 
The study population adequately represents the intended target population of patients with T2DM, 
patients on metformin alone or in combination with one other oral antidiabetic agent with insufficient 
glycaemic control. The age group 65 to 74 years (19.8% in the placebo group and 18.7% in the 
linagliptin group) was rather small to reflect the real proportion of T2DM and the group of ≥ 75 years 
(3.4% placebo and 2.9% linagliptin) was not sufficiently considered.

  Numbers analysed 
In both treatment groups, more than 97% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis and 
more than 89% in the secondary FAS-completers and PPS analysis. Treatment compliance was 97.7% 
in the placebo and 96.8% and thus similar between both treatment groups

The add-on of 5 mg QD linagliptin to metformin was superior to add-on of placebo to metformin in 
lowering HbA1c with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -0.64% (p< 0.0001). The unadjusted 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c showed similar results. 
  Adjusted means for the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at Week 24 – FAS (LOCF) 
In the linagliptin group, HbA1c levels decreased until week 12 and remained relatively stable 
thereafter. In the placebo group, HbA1c levels increased minimally over time. 
The secondary analysis PPS supports the results of the primary analysis, the placebo adjusted 
treatment effect was (mean difference [95%CI]: -0.68 [-0.84; -0.53] p<.0001 for HbA1c. The FAS-
completers showed a smaller placebo adjusted treatment effect [95%CI]: -0.57 [-0.72; -42] for 
HbA1c.   
Whereas the adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was slightly smaller for Asian than for 
European patients (-0.49% vs. -0.57%, respectively), contrasting results were obtained for the 
placebo-adjusted changes (-0.73% vs. -0.51%).

Secondary endpoints 
The add-on of 5 mg QD linagliptin to metformin was superior to add-on of placebo to metformin in 
lowering FPG with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -21.1 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L).  
More patients on linagliptin compared to placebo achieved HbA1c values of <7% or <6.5% or an 
HbA1c reduction of ≥0.5%. 
  Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − FAS (LOCF)  
In the MTT subpopulation the treatment difference in adjusted mean change from baseline at week 24 
was -67.13 mg/dL (p<0.05) for 2hPPG and -5.35 mmol h/L (p<0.05) for glucose AUC in favour of 
linagliptin.  
The proportion of patients requiring the use of rescue medication was 18.9% in the placebo group and 
7.8% in the linagliptin group (odds ratio 0.276, p < 0.05). In addition linagliptin patients required 
rescue therapy later than placebo patients. 
Other endpoints 
The treatment difference in the adjusted means of change from baseline to 24 weeks in body weight 
was estimated to be 0.04 kg. 
Discussion of the study results 
The results of this study showed statistically significant and clinically relevant (albeit moderate) 
superior efficacy of linagliptin 5 mg as add-on in comparison to placebo add-on in patients with T2DM 
with insufficient glycaemic control on metformin. Results of primary and secondary analyses were 
consistent.  
Due to differences in placebo response, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect was larger in Asian 
patients (-0.73%) than in European patients (-0.51%).  
Study 1218.18 
This was a study in patients with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg as add-
on to metformin in combination with a SU in comparison to placebo. Patients were treated in the 
following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Korea, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, 
Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

Study period was from 25 February 2008 to 21 May 2009 
  Design 
Multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting of an 
open-label, 2-week placebo run-in, followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment period and a 1-week 
follow-up after termination of study medication. 
  Study participants 
Patients with T2DM, pre-treated only with a stable daily dose of ≥ 1500 mg per day (or documented 
maximally tolerated dose) of metformin and a maximally tolerated dose of a SU both unchanged for at 
least 10 weeks prior to study. 
HbA1c at screening and after the placebo run-in period had to be between 7.0% and 10.0%.  
  Treatments 
Patients eligible after the run-in period were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to either 5 mg linagliptin or 
placebo. 
Results  
  Participant flow  
A total of 1598 patients were enrolled and 1058 were randomized. The most common reason for not 
being randomized was not fulfilling HbA1c criteria (26 %). 
The highest percentage of randomized study participants were from Asia (50.6%), whereas only 
18.7% were from Europe and the lowest percentage from North America (8.7%). 
The discontinuation rates were 8.0% in the placebo group and 7.3% in the linagliptin group. The main 
reasons for premature discontinuation were refused to continue trial medication (3%) in the placebo 
group and adverse events (2.9%) in the linagliptin group.

Disposition of randomised patients  
* Treated refers to treatment with randomised study drug 
# Includes patients discontinued due to hyperglycemia 
  Conduct of the study 
There were three global and six local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments performed during the study are considered not influencing the study results. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
  Baseline data 
At study start, main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
Age: 58.1 y (23-79), 27.3% of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
BMI:  28.33 kg/m2 (15.75-39.97), 32% had a BMI ≥ 30,  
Diabetes duration: 23.9% had duration of diabetes > 1 to 5 years, 73.3% >5 years. 
Overall, 47.2% of patients were male, 46.6% were Caucasian and 51.7% were Asian.  In both 
treatment groups, around 22% of the patients were of Hispanic/Latino origin. 
eGFR: (MDRD staging, mL/min): 57.0% had an eGFR ≥90 and 5% an eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min   
There were no relevant differences in mean values of baseline characteristics including efficacy 
variables. 
The study population adequately represents the intended target population of patients with T2DM with 
an insufficient glycaemic control despite a background therapy of metformin and a SU. However, the 
very elderly subgroup of T2DM of ≥ 75 years (3.0% placebo and 4.8% linagliptin) was not sufficiently 
considered.  
Page 44/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Numbers analysed 
In both groups, over 98% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis, over 93% in the PPS 
analysis and over 90% in the FAS-completers analysis (see Table below). Treatment compliance was 
96.5% in the placebo and 97.8% in the linagliptin group. 
Number of patients by analysis set 
  Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
The add-on of 5 mg QD linagliptin to metformin and a SU was superior to add-on of placebo in 
lowering HbA1c resulting in mean adjusted mean treatment difference of -0.62%.  
Adjusted means for the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at Week 24 – FAS (LOCF) 
The secondary PPS analysis supports the results of the primary analysis, the placebo adjusted 
treatment effect was (mean difference [95%CI]: -0.61 [-0.73; -0.49] p<.0001) for HbA1c. 
The FAS-completers showed a smaller placebo adjusted treatment effect [95%CI]: -0.54 [-0.66; -
0.42] p<.0001 for HbA1c.   
HbA1c results were similar in patients on metformin doses ≥ 1500 mg and <1500 mg. 
Whereas the adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was similar for Asian and European patients 
(-0.69% vs. -0.63%, respectively), placebo-adjusted changes were not (-0.69% vs. -0.47%, 
respectively). 
Page 45/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No significant effect of the baseline metformin dose was observed on HbA1c in this trial. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The add-on of 5 mg QD linagliptin to metformin and a SU was superior to the add-on of placebo in 
lowering FPG resulting with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -12.7 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). The 
results were confirmed by the secondary FAS-completer analysis.  
A larger proportion of patients in the linagliptin compared to the placebo group achieved HbA1c levels 
< 7% or < 6.5% or HbA1c reduction ≥0.5% (see Table below).  
Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − (NCF) – FAS 
The number of patients requiring rescue therapy was 34 (13.0%) in the placebo group and 42 
(5.4%) in the linagliptin group (odds ratio: 0.361, p<0.0001). The median time to start of rescue 
therapy was shorter (119 days) for patients under placebo than for patients under linagliptin treatment 
(132 days).  
Other endpoints 
No meaningful change in body weight was noted in both treatment groups.  
Discussion of the study results 
In the present study, linagliptin add-on at a dose of 5 mg q.d. provided statistically significant and 
clinically relevant (albeit modest) improvement in glycaemic control compared to placebo add-on in 
patients with T2DM not sufficiently controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea. The superiority was 
reflected in all glycaemic parameters evaluated and the proportion of patients requiring rescue 
therapy.  
Due to differences in placebo response, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect, again, was larger in 
Asian patients (-0.69%) than in European patients (-0.47%).

(1218.15, 1218.16, 1218.17, and 1218.18, with different background medication).  
The baseline characteristics of patients in the 4 individual studies were similar in the linagliptin and
placebo groups. Some imbalances between the linagliptin and placebo were seen with regards to pre-
treatment with oral antidiabe
tic agents: the percentage of patients without prior use of OADs was 
16.5% for linagliptin and 21.7% for placebo, and 52.7% (linagliptin) and 46.6% (placebo) of patients 
took 2 or more prior OADs. 
The pooled analysis across the 4 placebo-controlled pivotal trials showed that age, gender, BMI, 
diabetes duration, previous antidiabetic medication, renal impairment or insulin resistance did not 
relevantly affect treatment response to linagliptin but demonstrated a highly significant influence
 of 
race /geographical region on placebo-adjusted HbA1c decreases, the reasons of which are
 unclear. The 
overall treatment effect in European/Caucasian patients is smaller than in Asian patients and of 
borderline
 clinical relevance. Below there is a detailed description of the pooled analysis. 
  Age 
The adjusted mean treatment differences in HbA1c were very similar across 
age categories except for 
the patients aged 75 years or older, for whom the difference in adjusted means was numerically higher 
(-0.83%). However, the number of patients in this age category was small.

  Gender 
Demographic characteristics of both genders were well balanced between linagliptin and placebo. 
Change in HbA1c from baseline was independent of gender. 
  Race 
When demographics were compared between Caucasian and Asian patients, lower mean age (54.4 vs. 
59.0 y) and mean BMI (26.05 kg/m2 vs. 30.91 kg/m2) were observed for Asian patients. The number 
of Black patients was small (linagliptin: 12 patients; placebo: 4 patients).  
For Asian patients treated with linagliptin, a similar adjusted mean change from baseline after 24 
weeks was observed as for Caucasian patients (Asian: -0.60%; Caucasian: -0.65%). However, an 
increase in mean HbA1c after 24 weeks was seen in Asian patients receiving placebo (0.20%). Thus, 
the adjusted mean difference between linagliptin and placebo was greater for Asian patients (-0.80%) 
th
an for Caucasian patients (-0.50%). The low p-value for the treatment-by-race interaction term (p = 
0
.0003) indicated that race may have had an influence on the treatment effect of linagliptin.

On request by the CHMP, data on DPP-4 inhibition across races were presented. The level of DPP-4 
inhibition in the linagliptin Phase III-trials was calculated by race, based on the pooled studies 
1218.16, 1218.20, and 1218.23. The analysis of DPP-4 inhibition at Week 24 to 28 showed that 
linagliptin 5 mg reached a sufficient median DPP-4 inhibition of 84% and 82% in Caucasian and As
patients, respectively (mean ± SD: 78 ±27% and 80 ± 14% in Caucasian and Asian patients, 
respectively)  and similar DPP-4 inhibition across regions. 
ian 
 
Geographical region 
T
he absolute HbA1c reductions from baseline were not markedly different across regions. Differences 
in placebo-adjusted effect sizes were, however, larger between regions, the reasons of which are 
unknown. The overall placebo-adjusted treatment effect in European patients was small (-0.44% in 
HbA1c) and of questionable clinical relevance. This finding is also in line
 with the result from the 
re
lated analysis regarding race indicating that Caucasian patients had a smaller placebo-adjusted 
HbA1c reduction (-0.5%
) than Asian paitents (-0.8%).  
A
 limitation of the studies was that a large proportion of the European pati
ents were recruited from 
Russia and the Ukraine, where lifestyle and diabetes care may be different from patients in the EU 
p
otentially contributing to a larger placebo effect. A new subgroup analysis as requested by the CHMP 
demonstrated that the treatment difference of linagliptin in comparison to placebo was -0.57% in 
HbA1c in pooled data from patients from EU countries (studies 1218.16, 1218.17, 1218.18, 1218.35 
and 1218.50).  
  Baseline body mass index 
The placebo-adjusted treatment differences in mean change in HbA1c was comparable between the 2 
BMI categories (BMI <30 kg/m2: -0.64%; BMI ≥30 kg/m2: - 0.59). There was no striking difference in 
placebo response in obese (-0.15%) vs. non-obese (-0.06%) patients. 
  Baseline HbA1c 
The absolute and placebo-adjusted mean difference in the HbA1c change from baseline between 
linagliptin and placebo increased with increasing baseline HbA1c.

  Time since diagnosis of diabetes  
Overall, treatment effect of linagliptin was independent of the time since diagnosis of diabetes alth
ough 
placebo-adjusted HbA1c changes were somewhat lower in patients with diabetes duration < 1year (-
0.49%) than in those diagnosed for 1 to 5 years (-0.62%) and those diagnosed for more than 5 ye
ars 
(-0.66%). 
  Washout of previous antidiabetic medication 
The key demographic parameters were overal
l balanced between linagliptin and placebo. As to race 
distribution, 73.4% of the patients who washed out previous OADs were Caucasian, but only 55.6% of 
those who did not wash out prior OADs. Correspondingly, 26.0% of the patients who performed a 
washout were Asian, compared with 43.8% of those who did not wash out prior OADs. 
Even though the treatment difference was numerically higher for those patients who washed out prio
r 
OADs than for those who did not (-0.72% vs. -0.59%), there was no significant treatm
ent-by-washout 
interaction (p = 0.1392) indicating that the washout of previous antidiabetic medication before 
randomisation did not relevantly influence on the treatment effect of linagliptin. 
  Renal impairment 
Most of the patients had none or mild renal impairment. As expected, patients with lower renal 
function were on average older and had a longer duration of diabetes. Nevertheless, treatm
ent 
responses were similar among MDRD groups. 
  Baseline HOMA IR 
The results do not suggest an influence of insulin resistance on the treatment effect of linagliptin. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency were investigated in the PK/PD study 1218.26 (see 
Pharmaco
kinetics section above). Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency could regularly be 
Page 56/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enrolled in phase III trials but severe renal impairment was an exclusion criterion. In the four pivot
al 
trials, a total of 987 (linagliptin, N=715) patients with mild renal impairment and 109 (linagliptin, 
N=80) patients with moderate renal impairment were enrolled. The treatment effect of linagliptin in 
terms of adjusted mean differences to placebo in HbA1c was similar in patients with normal renal 
function (-0.61%), and patients with mild (-0.63%) or moderate (-0.57%) renal impairment. Efficacy
of linagliptin was also demonstrated in a separate trial in patients with severe renal insufficiency (stud
y 
1218.43). In this trial the adjusted mean difference to placebo in HbA1c after 52 weeks was -0.72%.  
The results from both phase I and phase III results showed that dose adjustment for linagliptin is not 
necessary in patients with renal impairment. 
Patients with hepatic impairment were investigated in the PK/PD study 1218.27 but were excluded in 
phase III trials. However, 
DPP-4 inhibition in all hepatically impaired subjects in study 1218.27 was 
generally greater or equal 80% over the whole steady state dosing interval (full efficacy of DPP-4 
inhibitors is normally reached with >/= 80% DPP-4 inhibition). Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the 
observed differences in linagliptin exposure are considered to be not clinically relevant and thus, no 
dose adjustment is considered necessary in all severity types of hepatic dysfunction.   
In the clinical studies, the number of patients aged 75 years or above was very low (in the combined 
four pivotal placebo-controlled studies: 19 and 66 patients for placebo and linagliptin, respect
ively).  
Supportive studies 
Long-term efficacy and safety were examined in studies: 1218.20, 1218.23 and 1218.40.  
Other supportive studies submitted with this application are studies 1218.35 and 1218.50. 
During the registration process, (interim) results of several supportive t
rials were presented. Results 
were submitted of a study with linagliptin monotherapy in patients with severe renal insufficiency 
(study 1218.43). In this study, 133 patients were randomised to receive placebo (65 patients) or 5 
mg 
linagliptin once daily (68 patients). In addition, results were presented of a recent Phase IIb trial 
(1218.62) with linagliptin dual combination therapy. This trial investigated the efficacy of linagliptin 2.5
mg twice
 daily (bid) and linagliptin 5 mg once daily versus placebo as add-on to metformin over 12 
weeks.  
Study 1218.20 was a multinational, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study to evaluate 
efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg compared to glimepiride over two years, in T2DM patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control despite metformin therapy. After 52 weeks, lnagliptin was associated 
with a decrease in HbA1c of -0.38%, and glimepiride was associated with a decrease of -0.60%
 in the 
full analysis set (FAS). According to the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.35% for HbA1c, non
-
inferior effi
cacy of linagliptin vs. glimepiride could be shown in the primary FAS analysis at 52 weeks 
(treatment difference 0.22%). The PPS analysis showed a slightly higher treatment difference with a 
mean value of 0.
26%. After 104 weeks, linagliptin was associated with a decrease in HbA1c of -0.16%, 
and glimepiride was associated with a decrease of -0.36% in the full analysis set (FAS) with a mean 
treatment difference of 0.20%. The PPS (LOCF) analysis again showed a l
arger treatment difference of 
0.28% in HbA1C. 
Study 1218.23 was a placebo and active-controlled study using voglibose. Voglibose is not approved in 
the EU and, therefore, the comparison with voglibose is not considered relevant for this application. 
Study 1218.40 was an open-label extension trial without a control group in patients who completed 
one of the 4 pivotal placebo-controlled trials (1218.15, 1218.16, 1218.17, or 1218.18). The object
ive 
was primarily to evaluate safety of 5 mg linagliptin during long-term treatment as monotherapy or in 
combination with metformin, pioglitazone, or metformin in addition to a sulphonylurea drug. 
Page 57/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the objective was to assess efficacy in a descriptive exploratory way. All patients 
received 5 mg linagliptin.  
Patients were analysed according to their previous exposure to linagliptin. In the group of patients who 
had received linagliptin in the previous studies, the HbA1c levels achieved during the 24 weeks of 
treatment in the previous trials were maintained in this extension study until week 42. Thereafter, 
HbA1c appeared to increase slightly but patient numbers were small.  
In the group of patients who had been randomised to placebo in the previous studies, the maximum 
effect of linagliptin on HbA1c was observed at Week 18 of this extension study (mean change from 
baseline: -0.68%). From Week 30 to Week 42, no 
further reductions in mean HbA1c values were 
observable. Subsequently, HbA1c levels started to slightly increase again but patient number became 
smaller. 
Study 1218.35 was a multinational, 18-week study investigating efficacy and safety of 5 mg lina
gliptin 
in combination with a SU.  
Linagliptin was superior in reducing HbA1c compared to placebo with a mean treatment difference of 
-
0.47% (95% CI -0.7, -0.24) at week 18 week. However, the clinical relevance of this effect is 
considered questionable. Subgroup analysis confirmed that gender did not influence the treatment 
response. 
Asian patients had a larger mean change from baseline in HbA1c (-0.76%) than European (-0.40%
) 
patients.  
The placebo-adjusted effect on HbA1c in European patients was -0.29%. 
Study 1218.50 investigated efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg compared to placebo (part 
1, 18 
weeks) and to glimepiride (part 2, 34 weeks) in patients intolerant to metformin therapy. 93% of 
study 
population did not tolerate metformin due to gastrointestinal intolerance. 
At week 18 linagliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c with a mean treatment difference
 of -
0.57%. Secondary results were consistent. The mean HbA1c change from baseline was small and 
similar in Asian (-0.35%) and European (-0.37%) patients. However, the placebo-adjusted trea
tment 
mean change in HbA1c was larger in Asian patients (-0.80%) than in Caucasian patients (-0.45%).  
The results of part 2 of the study (double-blind extension period, where placebo patients switche
d to 
glimepiride) were provided during the evaluation of this application. The results
 showed a fall in the 
mean HbA1c change from baseline in the control group (glimepiride) from Week 18 to Week 30 and 
thereafter the mean was fairly constant. The mean HbA1c change from baseline remained constant fo
r 
linagliptin from Week 18 throughout the remainder of the trial. There were differences in mean HbA1c 
from baseline between linagliptin and glimepiride from Week 30 onwards, with glimepiride having a 
larger decrease from baseline compared with linagliptin. The treatment with glimepiride induced a 
decrease in HbA1c of 0.82%, whereas linagliptin was associated with a decrease of 0.44%. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and safety of linagliptin were studied in 11 phase II/III studies, comparing the effects of 
linagliptin with placebo as monotherapy in general, as monotherapy in patients intolerant for 
metformin, as add-on to metformin or sulphonylurea or pioglitazone, and as triple therapy with 
sulphonylurea and metformin. 
Overall, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin once daily resulted in a decrease in HbA1c of appro
ximately 
0.6%. For Asian patients treated with linagliptin, a similar adjusted mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c was observed as for Caucasian patients (Asian: -0.60%; Caucasian: -0.65%). However, the 
Page 58/84
 
 
 
 
 
placebo-adjusted mean treatment difference was greater for Asian patients (-0.80%) than for 
Caucasian patients (-0.50%). The relatively small effect size in European patients (per se and in 
comparison with Asian patients) was more or less observed in all studies. In PK studies, peak and total 
exposure were about 30% higher in Japanese and Chinese subjects than in Caucasian subje
cts. 
However, the median and mean level of DPP-4 inhibition was similar in the different races and 
geographical regions. Potential differences in diet and diabetes care may have explained the 
differences between Asian and Caucasian patients. Since the majority of European patients were 
recruited from countries ou
tside the EU, a new subgroup analysis on EU patients was requested by the 
CHMP. This analysis demonstrated that the treatment difference of linagliptin in comparison to placebo 
was -0.57% in pooled data from patients from EU countries (studies 1218.16, 1218.17, 1218.18, 
1218.35, 1218.50), providing reassurance that linagliptin is effective in the EU population. The placebo 
effect was rather high in the non-EU countries compared to EU countries which may be due to 
differences in pre-study diabetes care. The pooled analyses including the 4 pivotal placebo-controlled 
trials suggest that age, gender, BMI, diabetes duration, previous antidiabetic medication, renal 
impairment or insulin resistance did not relevantly affect treatment response.  
No active-controlled trial investigating linagliptin monotherapy has been submitted. The applicant did 
not apply for an unrestricted monotherapy indication, but only for an indication in patients for whom 
metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or is contraindicated due to renal impairment. Linagliptin
showed acceptable efficacy in European patients in the pivotal study 1218.16 (placebo-adjusted effect 
-0.52%). In the supportive study 1218.50, the effect in the European population was small (placebo-
adjusted difference was -0.15%); however, the effect in the Caucasian population was similar to 
results in study 1218.16 (placebo-adjusted difference: -0.43%). Considering the fact that in 93% of 
the patients in study 1218.50 metformin was inappropriate due to gastrointestinal intolerance, an 
indication in those patients is acceptable. The number of patients in this study with contraindications 
for metformin due to severe renal insuffic
iency or hepatic insufficiency was low. However, in a 
dedicated study in patients with severe renal impairment, linagliptined proved to be effective. Taken 
the available data in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment together, linag
liptin appears to 
be a relevant treatment option in this population for whom metformin is contraindicated. Thus, the 
currently proposed restricted monotherapy indication (for patients for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal impairment) is considered acceptab
le. 
Linagliptin was investigated in initial combination with pi
oglitazone. However, this study was performed 
in patients that were pretreated with a variety of oral antidiabetic drugs: 50% of subjects had not 
received any glucose lowering drugs before the study, 30% was on one drug and 18% on two or more. 
Therefore, at least half of the patients can not be considered as insufficiently controlled on 
pioglitazone, and therefore efficacy in the claimed indication (in combination with a thiazolidinedione, 
when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control)
has not been adequately demonstrated. In addition, the treatment effect in European patients was 
relatively weak (-0.37%). 
In dual combination therapy with metformin, a relevant decrease in HbA1c was found (-0.51%) in 
European patients of study 1218.17, supported by a change of –0.73% in the dose-finding study 
1218.6. The supportive study 1218.62 investigated the efficacy of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily and 
linagliptin 5 mg once daily versus placebo as add-on to metformin over 12 weeks. In Caucasian 
patients, the placebo adjusted treatment effect of linagliptin was -0.69 (2.5 mg bi
d) and -0.66 (5 mg 
qd) suggesting that linagliptin has similar glucose-lowering effects with both treatment regimens.  
The claim of non-inferior efficacy of linagliptin compared to glimepiride (study 1218.20) is not 
appropriately supported by data.  The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was too wide considering the 
treatment effects observed for linagliptin as well as glimepiride. In addition, approximately 50% 
of the 
patients did not receive the maximum dose of 4 mg of glimepiride. Moreover, despite relatively low 
Page 59/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline HbA1c values, more patients in the linagliptin group than in the glimepiride group needed 
rescue medication (24.7% linagliptin; 21.5% glimepiride) or discontinued the trial due to lack of 
efficacy (5.8% linagliptin; 1.9% glimepiride). Interestingly, data from the second part of study 
1218.50 showed that the treatment with glimepiride induced a mean decrease in HbA1c of 0.82%, 
whereas linagliptin was associated with a decrease of 0.44% further supporting the impression that 
efficacy of the two agents is not similar.  
The CHMP was of the view that the indication of linagliptin in dual therapy with SU is not approvable 
because the placebo-adjusted effect on HbA1c in European patients was only -0.29%. 
Triple therapy was investigated in one trial in which linaglip
tin was compared to placebo in patients 
treated with a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea (1218.18). The treatment effect of 
linagliptin was -0.62%. However, the placebo-adjusted mean change in HbA1c was, larger in Asian 
patients (-0.69%) than in European patients (-0.47%), 
The treatment effect of linagliptin in terms of adjusted mean differences to placebo in HbA1c was 
similar in patients with normal renal function (-0.61%), and patients with mild (-0.63%) or moderate
(-0.57%) renal impairment. In the dedicated trial in patients with severe renal insufficiency (1218.43) 
the adjusted mean difference to placebo in HbA1c after 52 weeks was also similar (-0.72%).  Ef
ficacy 
of linagliptin in patients with various degrees of renal impairment appears reasonably established. 
The number of patients with hepatic impairment (n = 34) was very small.  
In the clinical studies, the number of patients aged 75 years or above was very low (in the combin
ed 4 
pivotal placebo-controlled studies: 19 and 66 patients
 for placebo and linagliptin, respectively). It is 
difficult to estimate the effect of li
nagliptin on HbA1c in very elderly patients and the same applies to 
safety (see below). This ha
s been adequately reflected in the SmPC. Further data in these patients are 
needed. A new trial in elderly patients is now ongoing (as described in the RMP). 
Only 1 randomized trial with a study duration longer than 24 weeks (glimepiride-controlled trial study 
1218.20) was performed. Based on results of this trial, treatment effect of linagliptin appears largely 
maintained over one year of treatment. In both the linagliptin and glimepiride groups, maximum 
HbA1c reduction was achieved around week 16 with a more pronounced reduction observed for 
glimepiride. After this time point, mean HbA1c levels remain
ed stable in the linagliptin group, whereas 
in the glimepiride group they increased continuously. Therefore, the treatment difference became 
smaller over time but was still present at week 52 (the time point of the primary analysis). During the 
second year, the HbA1c levels of both the glimepiride and the linagliptin group increased (at week 104:
linagliptin change in HbA1c of -0.16%; glimepiride change in HbA1c of -0.36% in the full analysis se
t 
(FAS)). Evidence for long term efficacy is therefore limited, but follow up data of the studies do not 
indicate loss of efficacy (ongoing extension trial 1218.40). So far, HbA1c values in this trial appear 
rather stable over about one year. In the absence of a comparator, the overall rate of rescue therapy 
cannot be assessed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin once daily resulted in a modest effect on the primary efficacy 
endpoint (HbA1c) with statistically significant r
eductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and 
postprandial glucose. No direct comparison is made with other gliptins. A problem of this dossier is the 
inclusion of only a small percentage of patients from the EU or from North America in the clinical 
studies, especially when considering the observed differences in placebo-adjusted HbA1c reductions 
across races (Asians vs. Caucasians) and geographical regions. The subgroup analysis on pooled data 
on EU patients provides reassurance that linagliptin is efficacious in the population applied for. 
Page 60/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, linagliptin has been shown to be effective as monotherapy in patients with intolerance or 
contraindications due to renal impairment to metformin, and as add-on treatment with metformin or 
with metformin and SU. Efficacy of linagliptin has not sufficiently been demonstrated in European 
patients as add-on to SU or add-on to pioglitazone.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This application is supported by safety data from 37 studies, including 9 phase III trials, 4 phase II 
trials, and 24 phase I studies. Of the phase I studies, 20 were performed in healthy subjects, 2 studies 
in patients with type 2 diabetes, 1 study in non-diabetic and diabetic patients with renal impairment, 
and 1 study in non-diabetic patients with hepatic impairment. To permit a structured analysis of safety 
data, the trials were categorised into 8 study groupings, SAF-1 to SAF-8, with the aim to group trials of 
similar designs, durations, and patient/subject populations. 
SAF-1 is the largest set and comprises all trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes. This set 
was used to determine the frequency of rare adverse events and events of special interest. SAF-2 (all 
placebo-controlled trials) and SAF-3 (pivotal trials) are of particular interest because they allow the 
profiling of linagliptin against placebo. These 3 safety groupings overlap substantially: SAF-2 (all 
placebo-controlled trials) comprises about 80% of the patients in SAF-1 (all trials in patients) and SAF-
3 (pivotal trials) includes about 71% of patients of SAF-2. Since SAF-2 is the largest and most 
comprehensive placebo-controlled grouping, the subgroup analyses were based on this set. The 
different study groupings are summarized below in Table 8. 
During the registration process, results of the study with linagliptin monotherapy in patients with 
severe renal insufficiency (study 1218.43) were added. 
Grouping of studies for the analysis of safety 
Page 61/84
 
 
 
 
 
Patient exposure 
SAF-1 (all trials in patients with type 2 diabetes) comprised 6198 patients in total. Of these 4687 
patients were treated with linagliptin (any dose) and 4040 patients received linagliptin 5 mg once 
daily. In addition, 21 patients were treated with linagliptin 5 mg in the 1218.26 (phase I study in 
patients with renal impairment). Therefore the overall number of patients with type 2 diabetes who 
received treatment with linagliptin 5 mg was 4061. 
Of the patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg, 3430 patients were exposed for 6 months or longe
r, 2390 
patients for 12 months or longer and 536 patients for 18 months or longer. In
 the pool of placebo- 
c
ontrolled trials (SAF-2), overall exposure in patient years was higher in the linagliptin group than in 
the placebo group due to the weighted allocation ratios in most trials. 
In the trial with patients with severe renal failure, 68 patients were randomised to receive 5 mg 
linagliptin. 
Adverse events  
The overall percentages of patients with adverse events in SAF-2 were comparable between 
treatments (placebo 53.8% vs. linagliptin 55.0%). The proportions of patients with adverse events of 
mild (36.8% vs. 37.6% in the placebo and linagliptin group, respectively), moderate (15.6% vs. 
15.6%), or severe (1.4% vs. 1.8%) intensity were similar. Drug-related adverse events were slightly 
more frequent in the linagliptin group than with placebo (8.5% vs. 10.4%). The most frequent drug-
Page 62/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
related adverse events were hypoglycaemia with a higher incidence in the linagliptin group (2.4% vs. 
5.0%, in the placebo and linagliptin group, respectively, occurring predominantly in a background of 
metformin+SU), and hyperglycaemia with a higher incidence in the placebo group (1.5% vs. 0.5%). 
T
he frequency of premature discontinuations of study drug was higher in the placebo group than in the 
linagliptin group (3.6% vs. 2.3%). The difference was mainly due to higher incidences of 
hyperglycaemia (0.9% vs. 0.2%) and blood glucose increased (0.4% vs. 0.1%) in the placebo group. 
The incidence of serious adverse events was low in both treatment groups (2.5% vs. 2.7%). In SAF-2, 
there were 2 fatal serious adverse events in the linagliptin group and none in the placebo group. A 
summary of the adverse events by category is provided in the following table. 
     Summary of adverse events for SAF-2 (all placebo-controlled trials) - TS 
Generally, on the level of system organ classes, there were only small differences between the 
treatment groups. However, on the level of preferred terms some clear differences were observed. As 
expected, hyperglycaemia occurred with a higher frequency in the placebo/background group than in 
the linagliptin group (10.6% vs. 5.0%). Conversely, hypoglycaemia was less frequent in the placebo 
group (4.1%) than in the linagliptin group (7.6%). Overall, infections and infestations were the most 
frequent adverse events. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, and vascular disorders occurred with a higher incidence in the linagliptin group, 
however the difference never exceeded 2%. In addition, higher frequencies in the linagliptin group 
were also observed for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2.6% vs. 4.0%); where no preferred 
te
rm reached an overall incidence of 1% or above and no single preferred term showed a clear 
increase. The individual study reports describe 2 patients with photosensitivity with linagliptin.
Linagliptin was not associated with a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count.

Frequency of patients with adverse events occurring in more than 1% in either treatment group on t
he 
preferred term level, sorted by frequency in system organ class for the SAF-2 (all placebo controlled 
trials 
The overall incidences of adverse events (any adverse event) were similar in the placebo and 
linagliptin groups across background medications. The incidences of adverse events in the placebo 
arms ranged from 42.9% to 59.7% and in the linagliptin arms from 42.2% to 66.1%. For both 
treatment groups, the lowest incidences were observed with SU as background, however this may also 
b
e due to the shorter exposure of only 18 weeks in this trial. The highest incidences of adverse events 
w
ere observed with a metformin plus SU background in both treatment groups. The incidence of 
adverse events was particularly hi
gh with the triple combination of linagliptin plus metformin plus SU 
(66.1%). This was almost entirely due to an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia (14.8% vs. 22.8%). 
A similar pattern was observed for drug-related adverse events where also the metformin+SU 
combination showed higher incidences in both treatment groups, again this was due to higher 
incidences of hypoglycaemia (7.6% vs. 14.5%). The frequencies of adverse events that led to 
discontinuation of treatment were slightly higher in the placebo groups with all background 
medications with the exception of metformin+SU. The combination of linagliptin, metformin, an
d SU 
led to high incidences of metabolism disorders with substantially higher frequencies in the linagliptin

group. The differences in the system organ class were predominantly due to different incidences o
f 
hypoglycaemia. The frequency of hypoglycaemia events was 16.0% (placebo) and 23.7% (linagliptin). 
An analysis
 by age (<65, 65-74, ≥75 years) showed a substantial increase with older age, in the 
p
lacebo group from 12.0% to 37.5% and in the linagliptin group from 22.8% to 44.7%. In SAF-2 (the 
largest placebo-controlled safety group
ing of patients with T2DM treated with linagliptin 5 mg 
compared to placebo), the overall incidences of adverse events were higher in the group of patients 
with moderate renal impairment (50.0% placebo and 65.2% linagliptin 5 mg). However, these
 adverse 
events were relatively mild. Therefore, linagliptin could be considered as a possible alternative for 
metformin in patients with moderate renal insuffi
ciency. In the study with patients with severe renal 
impairment, the rate of AEs was higher than in the other trials, which was obviously due to the wo
rse 
condition of these patients. No major difference in AE incidence between the linagliptin and the pl
acebo 
group was observed in general (94.1% vs. 92.3%, respectively). All AEs of “renal impairment” 
(meaning worsening of renal function in these patients) were more frequent in the linagliptin (16.2% 
vs. 6.2%, respectively), but the absolute numbers were small. On average, renal function measured as 
eGFR was not influenced by linagliptin.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall there were 12 deaths in this clinical trial program: 7 patients died under treatment with 
linagliptin (SAF-1) and 3 patients died under treatment with glimepiride (SAF-4); 2 patients died after 
treatment with linagliptin during the post-treatment period in SAF-1. Of the patients who had r
eceived 
linagliptin (n=9), 8 patients died of cardiac conditions and 1 patient due to pulmonary embolism. None 
of the even
ts were considered to be related to the study medication. After adjustment for exposure 
years, estimates of death incidence rates (per 1000 patient years exposure) indicated comparable 
death rates for linagliptin and comparators. However, the incidence rate with placebo was 0.0.

and uncontrolled extension trial (BI trial 1218.40) 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
In SAF-2, the frequency of serious adverse events was low and comparable between treatment groups 
(placebo 2.5% vs. linagliptin 2.7%). In the post-treatment period 2 patients who had been randomised 
to placebo and 5 patients who had received linagliptin had serious adverse events. In the system organ 
classes, cardiac disorders (0.3% vs. 0.5%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0% vs. 0.1%), 
and vascular disorders (0.1% vs. 0.4%) slightly higher frequencies were observed in the linagliptin 
group than in the placebo group. Myocardial infarction (n=4), myocardial ischemia (n=1) and 
myocarditis (n=1) were only observed in the linagliptin group. For vascular disorders, the different 
Page 65/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidences were mainly due to higher frequencies of hypertension (0.1%) and hypertensive crisis 
(0.1%) in the linagliptin group. On average, no increase in blood pressure or heart rate was observed 
in SAF-2. 
Adverse events of special in
terest 
Based on scientific considerations and regul
atory advice the safety data base was searched for events 
of special interest which were hypersens
itivity reactions, renal events, hepatic events, severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions, and pancreatitis. The incidences of the adverse events of special interest 
were low and comparable between treatments.  
Using the largest set (SAF-1), in total 11 patients (8 patients under treatment with any dose of 
linagliptin and 3 patients in the post-treatment period) with pancreatitis were identified who had 
received linagliptin. In data set SAF-2 (controlled trials), pancreatitis was reported by 0 patients in the 
placebo group and 1 patient in the linagliptin 5 mg group. A very narrow definition for pancrea
titis was 
used so that the low incidence prevents further conclusions. During the registration process, the 
applicant used a set of terms that is rather broad but clearly related to pancreatitis to take into 
consideratio
n all conditions which could identify adverse action of linagliptin towards pancreas, e.g. 
worsening of an existing pancreatitis or acute exacerbation of an existing chronic pancreatitis. The 
Applicant selected relevant terms to cover potentially drug-induced events and exclude
 most likely not 
drug-induced events. Thus, 2 out of 2566 patients developed acute pancreatitis (or acute exacerbation 
of a chronic pancreatitis), i.e. slightly less than 1 in 1000. This is a rough estimate since the absolute 
number of events is low, leading to a high uncertainty, but it appears reasonable to designate 
pancreatitis as “rare”. Amylase elevations were more frequently observed under linagliptin than unde
r 
placebo.  
In SAF-2, hypersensitivity reactions were seen in 0.5% (placebo) and 0.7% (linagliptin) of patients. 
Among these were 2 patients with angioedema; one patient had a serious adverse event and in one 
patient it led to discontinuation. Renal events were reported by 2 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group 
and 3 patients (0.1%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group. H
epatic events were reported by 14 patients 
(1.2%) in the placebo group and 25 patients (1.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group. Skin exfoliation 
(n=5) and exfoliative dermatitis (n=1) were observed only in the linagliptin group. Of the 5 patients 
with skin exfoliation, 1 patient discontinued treatment. However, 4 patients had the highest severity
grade of mild and for 1 patient the hi
ghest severity was moderate. Furthermore, 1 patient experienced 
exfoliative dermatitis of moderate intensity. 
A total of 5239 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in a cardiovascular meta-analysis. 
The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular d
eath (including fatal 
stroke and fatal MI), non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalisation due to unstable angina. In 
total, 11 primary events were observed in the lin
agliptin group and a total of 23 primary events 
occurred in the comparator group (with 3 primary events in the placebo group, 20 primary events in 
the glimepiride group, and none in the voglibose group), resulting in incidence event rates (per 1000 
patient years of exposure) for the primary endpoint of 5.3 for linagliptin and 16.8 for the comparato
rs. 
Linagliptin treatment was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk, and the primary 
endpoint for linagliptin was significantly lower than for the total comparators. As most of the pr
imary 
events (58%
) occurred in the group receiving glimepiride an analysis against the pooled placebo-group 
confirmed that linagliptin was not associated with increased CV risk.

Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant findings or differences between the treatment groups were observed for any of 
the measured parameters (haematology and differential counts, electrolytes, enzymes, su
bstrates, 
urine analysis and sediment). 
Safety in special populations 
PK studies in hepatically and renally impaired patients were performed indicating no relevant changes
of PK in these patient populations. Animal studies revealed liver and kidney toxicity only at high, 
clinically irrelevant doses. For patients with moderate renal impairment in the placebo controlled trials, 
a higher overall incidence of adverse events was observed in the linagliptin group (50.0% vs. 65.2%). 
Study 1218.43 has been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with 
T2DM with severe chronic renal impairment. No major difference in AE incidence between the 
linagliptin and the placebo group was observed in general. The number of patients with hepatic 
impairment being treated with linagliptin was too low to yield any relevant information in a subgroup 
analysis.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Absorption and distribution of linagliptin are dependent on P-gp action. P-gp limits oral bio-availability 
of linagliptin. The P-gp inhibitor Ritonavir doubled oral bioavailability of linagliptin. However, in c
linical 
studies phase II/III, linagliptin was found to be safe in combination with CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors. In 
addition, linagliptin was shown to have a large safety window in phase I studies. Maximum total 
concentrations and maximum total AUC observed after administration of a single 600 mg dose were 
161 and 134-fold higher than after the administration of 5 mg linagliptin in combination with ritonavir. 
The effect of P-gp inhibition on the bioavailablity of metformin is adequately mentioned in the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The discontinuation rate was in general lower in the linagliptin groups than in the placebo groups. Lack
of efficacy was often the reason for discontinuation. No new safety concerns became obvious when 
regarding the discontinuation rates. 
Post-marketing experience 
There is currently no post-marketing experience with the use of this product. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, in the phase III studies with linagliptin the incidence of adverse event
s, drug-related adverse 
events, adverse events of severe intensity, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and serious 
advers
e events were very similar across studies, with no major differences compared to placebo and 
active comparator groups. In general, the safety profile appears comparable with other DPP-4 
inhibitors.  
The safety database is considered large enough and the observation period long enough to sufficiently
characterize the AE profile of linagliptin. However, the European diabetes guideline under r
evision 
(“Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes mellitus“, 
CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1) suggests to include an adequate number of high risk patients to represent 
as much as possible the general population of diabetic patients with regard to comorbidities, e.

risk factors, and concomitant drugs. From the baseline data it appears that only few such high risk
patients were included, especially not patients with high cardiovascular risk. 
Linagliptin appears to be tolerated relatively well in terms of gastrointestinal complaints. 
The adverse events clearly and consistently associated with linagliptin included an increased incidence 
of hypoglycaemia. This effect was most pronounced when linagliptin was added to a background
treatment of metformin and sulfonylurea, in particular in elderly patients: in very elderly patients, th
e 
incidence of investigator-defined-hypoglycaemic events was approximately 45% with linagliptin. 
However, in this age group, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events with placebo in combination with 
metformin and sulfonylurea was also relatively high (37.5%) and when causality is taken into a
ccount 
numbers were smaller. Also, medical assistance was only required in very small percentage of patients
. 
Other gliptins have also been associated with this problem when combined with SU derivatives as also 
indicated in their SmPCs. Similarly, this problem is sufficiently addressed in the SmPC of linagliptin.  
Experience in very elderly patients is limited. Study 1218.63, where only patients of at least 70 years
of age are included, is currently being conducted. This study will provide important information on the 
use of linagliptin in elderly patients. The SmPC adequately reflects that experience in elderly patients is 
limited. 
A numerical increase in AE frequency related to vascular disorders was consistently observed in all 
large controlled studies. The severity of the AEs was mainly mild or moderate; only a small number o
f 
severe AEs was observed, and linagliptin did not exceed placeb
o level in respect to severe AEs. 
The nature of the cardiovascular AEs with increased incidence under linagliptin was consistently related 
to blood pressure and heart rate. An increase of heart rate and biphasic reaction of blood pressure in 
response to linagliptin was also observed in non-clin
ical safety pharmacology studies. Blood pressure 
and heart rate were regularly measured before and during the clinical trials. On average, no increase in
blood pressure or heart rate was observed in SAF-2. However, taking into consideration the rather low 
incidence of hypertension cases including hypertensive crisis (around 3%), it is well conceivable th
at 
these cases could not noticeably alter the average blood pressure. The reasons for linagliptin’s 
potential effects on heart rate and blood pressure are not known. In the long run even small increase
s 
of blood pressure may accelerate the progression of CV disease. Effects of linagliptin on blood 
pressure, heart rate/rhythm and long-term cardiovascul
ar effects will be investigated in a randomized 
follow-up trial. This trial has already been started. 
The results of a dedicated meta-analysis of cardiovascular events based on independent adjudication 
suggest that treatment with linagliptin does not increase cardiovascular risk. In comparison with 
placebo, linagliptin was not associated with an increased CV risk. In comparison with placebo and 
active comparators (voglibose, glimepiride) combined, CV risk of linagliptin was estimated to be 
significantly lower. The current information on CV risk is very limited but, in line with other DPP-4 
inhibitors there is no suspicion of a detrimental effect.  
Long-term cardiovascular effects
 will be investigated in the above mentioned randomized follow-up 
trial.  
Death rate with linagliptin was higher in comparison to placebo but numbers were very small and after 
adjustment for exposure years, estimates of death incidence rates indicated comparable death rates 
for linagliptin and active comparators. None of the events were considered to be related to the study 
medication.  Also, the number of patients on placebo was much lower than on linagliptin.  
Linagliptin enhanced the pioglitazone-induced weight ga
in (study 1218.15). However, the effect was 
small, and it may be a class effect of DPP4 inhibitors. As described above, the combination of 
linagliptin and TZDs is not considered approvable. 
Page 68/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diabetic complications summarised under “microvascular disease”, including diabetic retinopathy, 
diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic neuropathy, were represented to a reasonable percentage (around 
20-25%) of patients. For patients with moderate renal impairment in the placebo controlled trials, a 
higher overall incidence of adverse events was observed in the linagliptin group (50.0% vs. 65.2%). 
Therefore, linagliptin should be used with care in these patients. Study 1218.43 has been conducted to
investigate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with T2DM with severe chronic renal 
impairment. No major difference in AE incidence between the linagliptin and the placebo grou
p was 
observed in general. All AEs belonging to the term “renal impairment” were more frequent in the 
linagliptin, but the absolute numbers were small. On average, renal function measured as eGFR 
was 
not influenced by linagliptin. The use of linagliptin in patients with severe renal insufficiency is 
considered acceptable. The number of patients with hepatic impairment being treated with linagliptin 
was too low to yield any relevant information in a subgroup analysis. Its use cannot be recommended. 
The higher frequ
ency of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the linagliptin group is a concern, as 
DPP-4 inhibitors have been associated with skin reactions during preclinical studies in animals. Skin 
exfoliation and exfoliative dermatit
is were observed only in the linagliptin group. This is in line with the 
serious skin reactions during treatment with other DPP-4 inhibitors and is addressed in the RMP. 
Phototoxicity did not occur during treatment with linagliptin, but the individual
 study reports describe 4 
patients with photosensitivity with linagliptin. The identification of these 4 patients was due to 
spontaneous reports from the patients. The complaints were mild to moderate. Active enquiries with 
regard to photosensitivity w
ill be performed in future studies. 
Two patients developed angioed
ema; one patient had a serious adverse event and in one patient the 
adverse event led to discontinuation. It is uncertain whether these reactions were due to linagliptin as 
they may have been influenced by co-medication.  
A higher incidence of infections has been
 described with other DPP-4 inhibitors. The DPP-4 inhibitors 
m
ay be relatively specific for GLP-1, but the long-term consequences of DPP-4 inhibition and its effects 
on
 other DPP-4 subs
trates, particu
larly with re
spect to immune fun
ction, are unkno
wn. Although 
linagliptin was not associated with
 an increased risk of in
fections (19.1% vs. 20.6%) or a decrease in 
absolute lymphocyte count, it is im
portant to realize that the
se ob
servations were done in relat
ively 
short term trials, and potential lon
g term effects
 remain a concern. This should be monitored closely 
po
st marketing, an issue that is
 addressed in the RMP. 
Si
milar to other GL
P-1 based thera
pies, linagliptin may be asso
ciat
ed with an increased risk o
f 
pancreatitis, but the number of ca
ses was not excessively high. 
2 
out of 2566 patients 
developed acute 
pancreatitis (or acute exacerbation
 of a chronic pancreatitis). T
his is a rough estimate since the 
absolute number of events is low, 
leadin
g to a high uncertainty, bu
t it appears reas
onable to designate 
pancreatitis as “rare”. No consistent increase in serum amylase wa
s detected throughout the la
rge 
controlled studies. A slightly higher percentage of serum amylase i
ncrease was observed in l
inagliptin-
treated patients than in placebo patients of data set SAF-2. This is
sue also needs to be monitor
ed 
further, as indicated in the RMP. 
Data indicate that the incidence of linagliptin-dependent AEs could
 be further increased b
y the 
presence of inhibitors of P-gp or CYP3A4. However, overall in clinical studies phase II/III, linagliptin 
was found to be safe in combination with CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors. 
In addition, linagliptin was show
n to 
have a large safety window in phase I studies. Maximum total con
centrations and maximu
m total AUC 
observed after administration of a single 600 mg dose were higher
 than after the administration 
of 5 
mg linagliptin in combination with ritonavir. The effect of P-gp inhi
bition on the bioavailablity o
f 
metformin has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Page 69/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In the phase III studies the overall incidence of adverse events was very similar across studies, with 
linagliptin being mostly comparable to placebo and active compara
tor groups. In general, t
he safety 
profile appears comparable with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Several iss
ues, including hypertensio
n, heart 
rate, pancreatitis, angioedema, photosensitivity and hypoglycaemi
a are appropriately labelle
d in the 
SmPC as potential adverse events. Long-term cardiovascular effec
ts will be investigated in a 
randomized follow-up trial, as described in the Risk Management P
lan. In patients with renal failu
re, no 
major difference in AE incidence between the linagliptin and the pl
acebo group was observed i
n 
general. It cannot be excluded that linagliptin increases the inciden
ce of infections and causes 
worsening of renal function under certain circumstances, and there
fore these potential risk
s will be 
followed in the RMP. Very elderly patients (above 75 years) and pa
tients with hepatic im
pairment were 
not investigated in sufficient numbers and the use of linagliptin in 
these patients cannot
 be 
recommended.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Linagliptin is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based DPP-4 inhibitor that lowers blood glucos
e 
levels by augmenting the glucose-stimulated insulin release through increased levels of e
ndogenous 
GLP-1.  
Efficacy and safety of linagliptin were studi
ed in phase II/III studies, comparing the effects of 
linagliptin with placebo  
-as monotherapy in general (1218.16),  
-as monotherapy in patients intolerant for metformin (1218.50) 
Page 77/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-as add-on to metformin (1218.17 and 1218.20)  
-as add on to sulphonylurea ((1218.35) 
-as initial combination therapy with pioglitazone (1218.15) 
-as triple therapy with sulphonylurea and metformin (1218.18). 
Additional relevant efficacy and safety data were obtained from the following phase II studies 
- (dose finding) monotherapy study 1218.5 (internal control metformin) 
- (dose finding) add-on to metformin study 1218.6 (interna
l control glimepiride) 
- monotherapy study in patients with severe renal insufficiency (1218.43) 
- linagliptin dual combination therapy with metformin (1218.62) 
All submitted studies are placebo-controlled except for study 1218.20, which used glimepiride as active
comparator. Pivotal efficacy studies are 1218.15, 1218.16, 1218.17 and 1218.18. However, the results 
of study 1218.15 (combination with pioglitazone) did not support an indication. The large active-
controlled study 1218.20 is also considered important 
In all studies, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin onc
e daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease 
of HbA1c, the primary efficacy endpoint. In comparison to placebo, linagliptin resulted in an overa
ll 
decrease in HbA1c of approximately 0.6%. However, in Caucasian or European patients, the target 
population of this application, the treatment effects were consistently smaller than in Asian patients. 
Similarly, efficacy results differed across geographical regions. However, when the results on E
uropean 
patients were confined to the EU population in an additional pooled subgroup analysis, the placebo-
adjusted treatment effects of linagliptin were more pronounced than in no
n-EU patients. 
In monotherapy, linagliptin showed relevant efficacy in European patients in the pivotal study 1218.16 
(-0.52%). A slightly lower effect was achieved in the monotherapy dose-finding study 1218.
5 (-0.46). 
In the supportive study 1218.50 in patients with intolerance to metformin, the placebo-adjusted 
difference in the European population was -0.15%. However, the effect in the Caucasian population 
was similar to results in study 1218.16 (placebo-adjusted difference
: -0.43). In addition, in the 
supportive study 1218.05 the placebo-adjusted treatment difference was -0.50 in Caucasians. 
In dual combination therapy with metformin a relevant placebo-adjusted decrease in HbA1c was found 
(-0.51%) in European patients of study 1218.17, supported by a change of –0.73% in the dose-finding
study 1218.6. In addition, the new study 1218.62 demons
trated a placebo adjusted treatment effect of 
linagliptin in combination with metformin in Caucasian patients (-0.69 for 2.5 mg bid; and -0.66 for 5 
mg qd).   
When linagliptin was added to SU in dual therapy the placebo-adjusted effect on HbA1c in European 
patients wa
s small, ie. -0.29%, and not considered clinically relevant.  
The efficacy of linagliptin in co
mbination with pioglitazone was investigated as initial combination 
therapy with about 50% of enroll
ed patients being treatment naive. Linagliptin treatment resulted in 
European subjects in a relatively small placebo-adjusted decrease in HbA1c of -0.37%. 
Linagliptin therapy in triple combination with metformin and SU resulted in an adjusted treatment 
effect in European patients of -0.47%.  
The treatment effect of linagliptin in terms of adjusted mean differences to placebo in HbA1c was 
similar in patients with normal renal function (-0.61%), and patients with mild (-0.63%) or mode
rate 
Page 78/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(-0.57%) renal impairment. In the separate trial in patients with severe renal insufficiency (1218
.43) 
the adjusted mean difference to placebo in HbA1c after 52 weeks was -0.72%.  
Linagliptin was largely weight neutral except in the combination with pioglitazone where it aggravated
the pioglitazone- induced weight gain for unknown reasons. A beneficial effect on weight was observed 
compared to glimepiride in study 1218.20 with a treatment difference of -2.49 kg at week 52.  
Linagliptin also was associated with a markedly lower frequency of hypoglycaemia compared to 
glimepiride (overall frequencies 5.4% vs. 31.8%). This included hypoglycaemic events with blood 
glucose levels below 54 mg/dL (9.5% vs. 33.1%) and severe hypoglycaemic events (2.4% vs. 3.6%),
although the number of severe events was low (1 vs. 9).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Linagliptin has been shown to be effective as monotherapy in patients with intolerance to metformin
, in 
patients with renal insufficiency that are not candidates for treatment with metformin, and as add
-on 
treatment with metformin or with metformin + SU. However, 
linagliptin has not been shown to be an 
effective treatment in European patients as add-on to SU and add-on to pioglitazone. In addition, the 
design of the add-on to pioglitazone trial was not appropriate, as at least 50% of patients in the study
were not failures on pioglitazone monotherapy.  
Regional/racial differences in treatment response have been observed with the smallest effect o
f 
linagliptin seen in European patients. In PK studies, peak and total exposure were about 30% higher in 
Japanese and Chinese subjects than in Caucasian subjects. However, the median and mean level of 
DPP-4 inhibition was similar in the different races. Therefore, the cause of the regional/racial 
differences remains unclear, but treatment differences between the EU and non-EU population within
Europe may best be explained by differences in pre-study diabetes care. 
In the active comparator study (1218.20) both active treatments resulted in a decrease of HbA1c from
baseline. However, non-inferior efficacy of linagliptin compared to glimepiride has not been 
convincingly demonstrated in this study. The impression that efficac
y of linagliptin is not similar to that 
of glimepiride is supported by new data from the second part of study 1218.50, where glimepiride vs. 
linagliptin induced a mean decrease in HbA1c of 0.82% vs. 0.44%. 
The finding of a lower number of hypoglycaemic events with linagliptin compared to glimepiride is an 
advantage and expected from the known mechanisms of action of these drugs. However, the observed 
beneficial effect of linagliptin may be overestimated considering the smaller glucose-lowering effect of 
linagliptin (leading to smaller HbA1c and FPG reduction). 
Very elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment have not been investigated in sufficient 
numbers. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database is considered large enough to sufficiently characterize the AE profile of linagli
ptin. 
The main basis for safety assessment was the SAF2 (N=3749, includin
g all placebo-controlled trials 
with linagliptin 5mg). The incidence of adverse events with linagliptin was mostly comparable to 
placebo and active comparator groups, and the safety profile appears comparable with other DPP-4 
inhibitors. Linagliptin appears to be tolerated relatively we
ll in terms of gastrointestinal complaints. 
One of the adverse events consistently associated with linagliptin was an increased incidence of 
hypoglycaemia. This effect was small when linagliptin was used in monotherapy or in combination w
ith 
Page 79/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metformin and was more pronounced when linagliptin was added to a background treatment of 
metformin and sulfonylurea, but was not always considered causally related and medical assistance 
was only required in a small percentage of the patients. Increase in hypoglycaemic events in 
association with insulin secretagogues is also known for other antihyperglycaemic drugs that per se 
have low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. This issue is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Similar to other GLP-1 based therapies, linagliptin may be associated with an in
creased risk of 
pancreatitis, although this did not appear to be an important problem in the presented trials. The 
relevance of the higher frequency of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the linagliptin group is 
unknown. Other DPP-4 inhibitors have also been associated with skin reactions during preclinical 
studies in animals. In addition, skin exfoliation (n=5) and exfoliative dermatitis (n=1) were observed 
only in the linagliptin group. These issues of pancreatitis and skin reactions are adequately address
ed 
in the SmPC and RMP and should be monitored further post licensing. 
Linagliptin was consistently (AEs and ADRs and across studies) associated with a slightly enhanced 
incidence of muscle pain. CK increases were not observed and most of the AEs were mild. Thus, 
musculoskeletal AEs are not regarded as a relevant concern. 
Although linagliptin generally was weight-neutral, it aggravated the pioglitazone-induced weight gai
n 
(+2.4 vs. +1.2kg for linagliptin+pioglitazone vs. pioglitazone,
 respectively; see study 1218.15) which 
may be unfavourable in respect to CV risk. The cause of the observed weight gain is unclear, but for 
several reasons, an indication for linagliptin in combination with pioglitazone is not acceptable. 
For patients w
ith moderate renal impairment in the placebo controlled trials, a higher overall incidence 
of adverse events was observed in the linagliptin group (50.0% placebo vs. 65.2% linagliptin, 
respectively). Therefore, lina
gliptin should be used with care in these patients. Patients with severe 
renal insufficiency were investigated in a separate trial.  No major difference in AE incidence between 
the linagliptin and the placebo group was observed in general (94.1% li
nagliptin vs. 92.3% placebo, 
respectively). All AEs belonging to the term “renal impairment” were more frequent in the linagliptin 
(16.2% linagliptin vs. 6.2% placebo, respectively), but the absolute numbers were small. On ave
rage, 
renal function measured as eGFR was not influenced by linagliptin. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As discussed above under safety, the current information of linagliptin on CV risk is limited
. The nature 
of the cardiovascular AEs with increased incidence under linagliptin was consistently related to 
hypertension and heart rate. On average, no increase in blood pressure or heart rate was observed in 
SAF-2. The results of a dedicated meta-analysis of cardiovascular events based on independent 
adjudication are difficult to interpret as confidence intervals are wide and data on high-risk patients 
limited. The available data, including comparison with active comparators (voglibose, glimepirid
e), did 
not indicate an increased risk, and there is no suspicion of a detrimental effect. These results, 
however, were largely dominated by the relatively high number of CV events in patients treated with 
glimepiride. In addition, the low incidences of cardiovascular disease in the trials reflect the fact t
hat 
patients with more severe pre-existing CV disease 
were not included in the studies. Nevertheless, the 
absence of an increased cardiovascular risk is in line with other DPP-4 inhibitors, where the 
assessment of CV risk also had its limitations. The applicant has indicated that a follow-up study 
including patients with high CV risk (study 1218.63) recently started. 
Death rate with linagliptin (incidence rate 1.9) was higher in comparison to placebo (incidence rate 0) 
but numbers were very small and data are inconclusive.  
The number of patients with hepatic im
pairment being treated with linagliptin was too low to yield any 
relevant information in a subgroup analysis. Its use cannot be recommended. Very elderly patients 
Page 80/84
 
 
 
 
 
(>75 yrs) have also not been investigated in sufficient numbers. Therefore currently, the use of 
linagliptin cannot be recommended in these populations. 
Phototoxicity did not occur during treatment with linagliptin. However, the individual study reports 
describe 4 patients with photosensitivity with linagliptin. The seriousness of these adverse events 
caused by linagliptin was mild to moderate. The 2 cases of angioedema that occurred in the linaglipti
n 
group may be due to co-medication. These issues are mentioned in the SmPC. 
The increased incidence of hypoglycaemia in combination with SU and metformin is not surprising. 
Other gliptins have also been associated with this problem when combined with SU derivatives as also 
indicated in their SmPCs. Thus, this problem has also been addressed in the SmPC of linagliptin. 
The higher incidence of infections has also been described with other DPP-4 inhibitors. The DPP-4 
inhibitors may be relatively specific for GLP-1, but the long-term consequences of DPP-4 inhibition and
its effects on other DPP-4 substrates, particularly with respect to immune function, are unknown. 
Although the increased incidence of infections with linagliptin was relatively small in comp
arison to 
placebo (19.1% vs. 20.6%) and linagliptin was not associated with a decrease in absolute lymphocyte 
count, it is important to realize that these observations were done in relatively short term trials, and 
potential 
long term effects remain a concern. This should be monitored closely post marketing, an 
issue that has been addressed in the risk management plan. 
The safety assessment after co-administration with the potent CYP 3A4/P-gp inhibitor ritonavir 
demonstrated that the total exposure of linagliptin was increased. However, this is not expected to 
affect safety. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The most important favourable effect of linagliptin is lowering of the HbA1c. This effect appears 
relatively small in comparison to the effects of other drug classes, such as metformin, insulin and SU 
preparations. The treatment response (HbA1c) was generally lower in
 European/Caucasian patients 
compared to Asian patients. When the results were c
onfined to the EU population in an additional 
pooled analysis, the placebo-adjusted treatment effects of li
nagliptin were more pronounced providing 
further reassurance that linagliptin is an effective treatment in the population applied for. 
Linagliptin’s additive effect to non-responders to SU derivatives is currently questionable. The effect 
on 
HbA1c was -0.29% in the European population. This is considered too small for justifying an indic
ation. 
In addition, add-on treatment to pioglitazone has not been approp
riately investigated as the study 
design is not considered appropriate. CHMP guidance for add-on trials, requests that the new 
antidiabetic agent should be added in non-responders to the established antidiabetic agent. In this tria
l 
50% of patients were drug-naïve, and therefore not non-responders. Considering the relatively small 
effect size (-0.37% decrease in HbA1c) and t
he increased weight gain the B/R ratio of this dual 
combination therapy appears unfavourable. 
The effects of linagliptin and glimepiride are not considered similar. Non-inferior efficacy of linaglipti
n 
compared to glimepiride has not been demonstrated sufficiently. Therefore, no statements were 
included in Se
ction 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The use of linagliptin in monotherapy as alternative to metformin is considered acceptable in patients 
that cannot take metformin due to gastrointestinal intolerance or in patients with contraindications to 
metformin due to renal impairment.  
Page 81/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linagliptin has a primarily non-renal route of excretion. This is an advantage of linagliptin in patients 
with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. For patients with renal insufficiency, efficacy in subgroup 
analyses as well as separate trial 1218.43 seems adequate. No major difference in AE incidence 
between the linagliptin and the placebo group was observed in general, but currently it cannot be fully 
excluded that linagliptin increases the incidence of infections and causes worsening of renal function 
under certain circumstanc
es. These issues will be followed as potential risks in the RMP. 
The finding of a lower number of hypoglycaemic events with linagliptin compared to glimepiride is
 an 
advantage and expected from the known mechanisms of action of these drugs. However, the beneficial 
effect of linagliptin may be overestimated considering the apparently smaller glucose-lowering effect o
f 
linagliptin (leading to small
er HbA1c and FPG reduction). Due to the presence of insulin resistance, 
hypoglycaemia, especially severe hypoglycaemia is usually not a major problem in patients with
 T2DM.  
However, (very) elderly patients are generally more prone to experiencing hypoglycaemia. Due to its 
mechanism of action, linagliptin is not associated with hypogl
ycaemia except when used in combination 
with a SU but the enhancement of SU-associated hypoglycaemia is also known for other 
antihyperglycaemic drugs and is there
fore not unique to linagliptin. The low propensity of linagliptin to 
cause hypoglycaemia is an advantage that may be relevant in patients more prone to hypoglycaemic 
events. 
Linagliptin is largely weight-neutral, except when given in combination with pioglitazone where it was
shown to aggravate pioglitazone-induced weight gain (+ 2.4k
g vs. +1.2 kg). On the other hand, 
linagliptin provides a weight advantage compared to SUs (-2,5 kg), which can be considered beneficial 
in the usually overweight/obese patients with T2DM. 
Efficacy and safety are currently insufficiently investigated in certain subgroups, such as very elderl
y 
patients (>75 yrs), and patients with hepatic impairment. Linagliptin does not appear to be related to 
a
n increased cardiovascular risk, but absolute numbers of CV events were very low. The possible 
increased risk of infections, s
kin reactions, and pancreatitis is also important, but it should be 
acknowledged that these possible side effects have also been associated with other DPP-4 inhibitors 
and they will be monitored according to the RMP. Additional, potentially new safety issues, in particula
r 
photosensitivity and angioedema have been addressed in the SmPC. 
Discussion on th
e benefit-risk balance 
Although overall, linagliptin provided statistically significant glycaemic i
mprovement, the treatment 
response (HbA1c) was generally lower in European/Caucasian patients compared to Asian patients. 
When the results in Europeans were confined to th
e EU population in an additional analysis, the 
treatment effects of linagliptin were somewhat more pronounced. 
As dual therapy with metformin, and as triple therapy with metformin and SU, a clin
ically relevant 
effect was obtained. However, t
he effect of linagliptin appeared smaller compared to glimepiride, and 
non-inferiority in patients treated with metformin was not demonstrated sufficiently and a respective 
statement in the SmPC cannot be accepted. 
The treatment effects of linagliptin in dual combination with SU and with pioglitazone appear too small
to justify an indication. Its use as monotherapy as alternative to metformin is appropriate in those 
patients for whom metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal 
impairment.  
Lack of data or availability of limited data on certain subgroups (i.e. hepatic insufficiency, very elderly) 
has been resolved by appropriate wording in the SmPC. More information on cardiovascular safety with 
linagliptin is important and will be investigated post
-marketing in the ongoing CV safety study, as 
described in the RMP. Several possible side-effects 
were identified, but the risks were only mildly 
Page 82/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elevated in comparison to placebo and comparators. Targeted follow up of adverse events o
f interest in 
the RMP may be sufficient.  
In conclusion, the benefit-risk of linagliptin for the claimed indication of the treatment of patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, to ac
hieve glycaemic control in dual combination with SU or with pioglitazone 
is considered negative. 
The benefit-risk of linagliptin for the claimed indication of the treatment of patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus, to
 achieve glycaemic control in monotherapy is acceptable as an alternative to 
metformin in pati
ents for whom metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due 
to renal impairment.  
The benefit/risk of linagliptin is also considered 
positive for linagliptin in dual combination with 
metformin or in tr
iple combination with metformin and a SU, when this treatment, together with diet 
and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP revie

in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal impairment.

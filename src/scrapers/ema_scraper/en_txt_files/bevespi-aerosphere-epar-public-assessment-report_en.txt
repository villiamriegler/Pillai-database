2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic obstructive lung disease is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible at a 
functional level. The chronic airflow limitation characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small 
airways disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative 
contributions of which vary from person to person. The airflow limitation is progressive in nature and 
associated with abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases. Over time, 
chronic inflammation causes structural changes, narrowing of the small airways, and decreases in lung 
elastic recoil, leading to lung constriction during expiration and may also contribute to airflow limitation 
and mucociliary dysfunction. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality with a 
substantial economic and social impact that is both substantial and increasing. Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease is one of the leading causes of death in the EU, and recent statistics suggest it will 
become the third leading cause of death globally by 2030. The prevalence of physiologically-defined 
COPD in adults aged ≥40 years has been reported to be approximately 10%. Smoking is the primary risk 
factor for COPD, and the causes behind COPD are multi-factorial including exposure to environmental 
stimuli such as passive exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, air pollution, and occupational hazards, 
as well as familial risk factors and a history of childhood respiratory infections. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
COPD is characterised by cough, dyspnoea on exertion or even at rest, with a consequent reduction of 
physical activity and deterioration of quality of life (QoL). The inflammatory response contributes to small 
airways disease (e.g. obliterative bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which in turn reduce the elastic recoil of 
the lungs leading to collapse and obstruction of the small airways during exhalation. Systemic features of 
COPD are very common and their evaluation allows a more accurate prediction of mortality risk and 
comorbidity risk than lung function alone. 
During the natural course of COPD, the majority of patients develop acute episodes of worsening of 
symptoms that differ from the day to day variations, and may require modifications in therapy. These 
episodes are referred to as exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are important because they are 
associated with accelerated FEV1 decline, significant morbidity, healthcare cost and mortality. 
According to the GOLD document, the assessment of the disease severity should take into account 
various aspects of the disease such as symptoms, degree of airflow limitation, exacerbation risk and 
comorbidities. Based on the overall disease severity, COPD patients can be divided into the following four 
groups: 
• 
• 
• 
Group A (i.e. patients with low risk [of future events such as exacerbations, hospital 
admissions or death] and less symptoms) 
Group B (i.e. patients with low risk and more symptoms) 
Group C (i.e. patients with high risk and less symptoms) 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 8/102 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Group D (i.e. patients with high risk and more symptoms) 
2.1.4.  Management 
Non-pharmacological treatment such as exercise and smoking cessation are cornerstones of COPD 
treatment. Pharmacologic therapy for COPD is used to reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and 
severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Several classes of 
medications are commonly used in treatment of COPD (bronchodilators, corticosteroids, 
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, antibiotics, and vaccines); long acting bronchodilators are a key element 
of pharmacologic treatment of COPD and are currently recommended in every treatment step of the 
GOLD strategy report. In patients not adequately controlled on a long-acting muscarinic receptor 
antagonist (LAMA) or long-acting beta2 receptor agonist (LABA) as monotherapy a combination of the 
two could be indicated thereby combining two long acting bronchodilators with different mode of action. 
About the product 
Bevespi Aerosphere 7.2 μg/5.0 μg pressurized inhalation suspension is a fixed-dose combination of 
glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. The product has been developed for the long-term, 
maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD. In this report it 
will be referred to as Bevespi Aerosphere or as GFF MDI (glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate 
metered dose inhaler). The monotherapy products related to Bevespi Aerosphere, glycopyrronium 
inhalation aerosol and formoterol fumarate inhalation aerosol, will be referred to as GP MDI and FF MDI, 
respectively, or as monotherapy components. 
The individual components of Bevespi Aerosphere are known to be used for multiple indications. 
Glycopyrronium is a LAMA which exerts its bronchodilatory effect via muscarinic receptors located on 
smooth muscle cells within the trachea and bronchi. Glycopyrronium is approved in many countries in 
multiple formulations for different indications, including an inhaled formulation for COPD. There are 
approved products in EU both as a monotherapy agent (Seebri Breezhaler) and in combination with the 
selective LABA indacaterol (Ultibro Breezhaler) . 
Formoterol, a LABA, is approved in many countries worldwide for use in asthma and COPD as a 
monotherapy product and in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or in COPD with LAMA. As a 
monotherapy product, formoterol is found in several formulations including Oxis Turbuhaler and Foradil 
Aerolizer. 
The nomenclature for expressing the doses of glycopyrronium in GP MDI and GFF MDI changed during the 
clinical development program to reflect the active moiety (glycopyrronium) instead of the bromide salt 
form (glycopyrrolate). The doses of GP MDI 14.4 µg and GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg (ie 14.4 µg of 
glycopyrronium) evaluated in studies conducted after December 2012 are equivalent to GP MDI 18 µg and 
GFF MDI 18/9.6 µg (ie 18 µg of glycopyrrolate [glycopyrronium bromide]) as expressed in earlier studies. 
In addition, all clinical studies expressed the doses of GFF MDI and FF MDI in terms of formoterol 
fumarate, while dose is expressed as formoterol fumarate dihydrate in the SmPC (9.6 μg of formoterol 
fumarate is equivalent to 10 μg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application submitted is a fixed combination medicinal product under Article 10(b) of Directive 
2001/83/EC – relating to applications for fixed combination products.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Bevespi Aerosphere (also referred to as GFF MDI) is presented as a pressurised 
inhalation suspension containing glycopyrronium (GP) and formoterol fumarate (FF) as active 
substances.  
The delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece of the inhaler) from each actuation contains 
glycopyrronium bromide 9 micrograms (equivalent to 7.2 micrograms of glycopyrronium), and 5 
micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate.  
The metered dose (the dose leaving the valve of the inhaler) from each actuation contains 
glycopyrronium bromide 10.4 micrograms equivalent to 8.3 micrograms of glycopyrronium, and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate 5.8 micrograms  
One dose consists of two actuations from the inhaler. 
The strength is expressed in terms of the delivered dose in each actuation of glycopyrronium (as 7.2 
micrograms) and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (5 micrograms) in line with the expression of strength of 
previously authorised products in the European Market.  
Other ingredients are: inert porous particle, consisting of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 
(DSPC), and calcium chloride and a liquid propellant, norflurane (HFA-134a). 
As described in section 6.5 of the SmPC, the product is available in a pressurised metered dose inhaler, 
comprising of an aluminium pressurised container with an attached dose indicator, supplied with a white 
plastic actuator body and mouthpiece with an orange dust cap. Each inhaler is individually packaged in a 
foil laminate pouch containing a desiccant sachet and packed in to a carton. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Glycopyrronium bromide 
General information 
According to the Ph.Eur., the chemical name of glycopyrronium bromide is 
3[(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl)oxy]-1,1-dimethyl pyrrolidinium bromide corresponding to the 
molecular formula C 19H 28BrNO 3. It has a relative molecular mass of 398.3 g/mol and the following 
structure:

Glycopyrronium bromide is a white or almost white, crystalline powder, freely soluble in water, soluble in 
ethanol (96 per cent), very slightly soluble in methylene chloride.  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 10/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glycopyrronium bromide has two chiral centers, so two pairs of enantiomers could exist. The active 
substance is a 50/50 mixture of threo enantiomers, (R,S) and (S,R). Thus, it is not optically active. Each 
batch of glycopyrronium bromide is tested for content of erythro enantiomers (R,R) and (S,S) (Ph.Eur. 
Impurity N) as part of routine quality control.  
As there is a monograph of glycopyrronium bromide in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of 
the unmicronised active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for glycopyrronium bromide (unmicronised) which has been provided within the 
current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information for the manufacture of the unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide has been 
assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
The micronisation and conditioning processes have been adequately described. The micronisation and 
conditioning processes can be regarded as validated. 
Specification 
Micronised glycopyrronium bromide complies with the current Ph.Eur. monograph with two additional 
tests for critical attributes for inhalation products.  Tests listed in the Ph.Eur. current monograph are 
description (visual), identity (IR, test for bromide), appearance of solution (Ph.Eur.), acidity or alkalinity 
(Ph.Eur.), assay (Ph.Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph.Eur.), impurity N (Ph.Eur.), related substances (Ph.Eur.), loss 
on drying (Ph.Eur.). The two additional tests are particle size distribution (laser diffraction) and microbial 
tests limits (Ph.Eur.).  
The microbial limits are in accordance with Ph.Eur. requirements. The CEP has an additional test for 
methyl bromide with method described.  
The non compendial laser diffraction test for the determination of the particle size distribution has been 
adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  qualitative  testing  has  been 
presented. 
Batch analysis data 1 batch of unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide and 3 batches of micronized 
substance of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch. 
Stability 
A re-test period of 5 years for unmicronised glycopyrronium bromide is included in the CEP. Stability data 
from three commercial scale batches of the micronized active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers (CEP holder and micronisation site) stored in a container closure system representative of 
that intended for the market for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All 
tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the micronised active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period for micronised active 
substance of 24 months when stored at 25 ºC / 60% RH in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Active substance 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
General information 
According to the Ph.Eur., the chemical name of formoterol fumarate dihydrate is 
N-[2-Hydroxy-5-[(1RS)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1RS)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl
] formamide (E)-butenedioate dihydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C42H52N4O12 . 2H2O. 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate has a relative molecular mass of 840.91 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 2: Formoterol fumarate dihydrate structure 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is a white or almost white or slightly yellow powder. It is slightly soluble in 
water, soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in 2-propanol, practically insoluble in acetonitrile. 
As there is a monograph of formoterol fumarate dihydrate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the 
manufacturer of the unmicronised active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the 
European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for formoterol fumarate dihydrate (unmicronised) which has been 
provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information for the manufacture of the unmicronised formoterol fumarate dihydrate has 
been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate micronisation is performed by the CEP holder. During the review, a 
description of the micronisation process, with ranges of process parameters and in-process controls, has 
been provided during the assessment and it is considered acceptable. The conditions used in the 
validation study might be considered as the preferred set-points. Periodical samples will be taken of the 
micronised active substance during the process and the particle size will be checked.  
Specification 
Micronised formoterol fumarate dihydrate complies with the provided CEP, which lists two additional tests 
if compared to the current Ph.Eur. monograph for formoterol fumarate dihydrate; micronised formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate is also tested for two additional critical attributes for inhalation products.  Tests listed 
in the Ph.Eur. current monograph are appearance (Ph.Eur.), identification (Ph.Eur.), assay (Ph.Eur.), 
related substances (Ph.Eur.), Impurity I (Ph.Eur.), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), pH (Ph.Eur.), and water 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018

(Ph.Eur.); the additional CEP tests are residual solvents (head space gas chromatography (HSGC)), 
palladium (Ph.Eur.), and the additional tests performed by the applicant are particle size distribution 
(laser light scattering), and microbial tests limits (Ph.Eur.).  
Micronised formoterol fumarate complies with the current Ph.Eur. monograph for formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate  with  the  additional  tests  for  residual  solvents,  palladium,  particle  size  distribution,  and 
microbial limits. The tests for residual solvents and palladium are additional tests listed in the CEP. The 
test for residual solvents by gas chromatography is also listed and described in the CEP.  Particle size 
distribution and microbial tests are critical attributes required for inhalation products. The microbial limits 
are in accordance with Ph.Eur. requirements. 
The non compendial laser light scattering for the determination of the particle size distribution has been 
adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  qualitative  testing  has  been 
presented. 
Batch analysis data for 3 batches of micronised substance of the formoterol fumarate are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
A re-test period of 5 years for non-micronised formoterol fumarate dihydrate is included in the CEP. 
During the review, stability data on the micronised active substance have been provided confirming that 
the particle size distribution complies with the specification and no trend is observed. Hence a re-test 
period of 5 years is accepted for the micronised. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a pressurised inhalation suspension, also referred as pressurised metered dose 
inhaler (MDI), containing two active substances (glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol fumarate) in a 
fixed-dose combination, suspended, thanks to the presence of ‘porous particles’ (made of 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and calcium chloride dihydrate), in a medium of 
norflurane (propellant). The formulation is contained within a coated aluminium can fitted with a metering 
valve, a white plastic actuator, an orange plastic dust cap and a can-top dose indicator. The product is foil 
overwrapped with desiccant.  
One presentation of 120 actuations per container is proposed; the total number of actuations is sufficient 
to allow for priming, repriming and 120 actuations, since 4 priming actuations are required before first 
use and 2 re-priming actuations are required after the inhaler is cleaned each week.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 
(DSPC) is used in the composition of the inhalation product Tobi-Podhaler (tobramycin), an inhalation 
powder approved in 2013, marketed by Novartis. Calcium chloride dihydrate is as also used in the 
composition of the inhalation product Tobi-Podhaler. Norflurane (hydrofluoroalkane HFA-134a) is a 
propellant used in many marketed metered-dose inhalers (MDI). Hence, there are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and 
in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The  suspension  is  formulated  with  micronised  glycopyrronium  bromide  and  micronised  formoterol 
fumarate co-suspended with ‘porous particles’ in propellant. The ‘porous particles’ are included in the 
formulation  as  a  suspension  forming  agent  as  both  active  substances  sediment  in  the  propellant 
norflurane. The density of the porous particles is less than that of the propellant and serves to prevent the 
sedimentation  of  the  active  substance  crystals,  providing  a  stable  suspension  with  consistent  aerosol 
properties.  
The ‘porous particles’ are a spray-dried mixture of the two excipients DSPC (93%) and calcium chloride 
(7%) from an emulsified feedstock also containing water and perflubron. Calcium chloride is used as it 
improves the stability of the porous particles. Calcium chloride meets the requirements of the Ph.Eur. 
monograph. Perflubron, which is not monographed in the Ph.Eur., meets the requirements of the USP, 
this is acceptable. A satisfactory description of the manufacturing method has been provided.  
Satisfactory specifications of the ‘porous particles’ have been provided and they include the tests that 
have  been  identified  during  the  course  of  development  as  critical  quality  attributes,  consisting  of 
description,  identification  via  IR,  residual  perflubron,  moisture  content,  compressed  bulk  density  and 
particle size distribution. Stability studies have shown that little or no degradation of ‘porous particles’ 
DSPC occurs during storage of the product. Porous particles have been shown to be suitable for inhalation 
at the concentrations used in finished product. A detailed assessment of toxicological safety aspects of the 
porous particles can be found in section 2.3.4 of this report. 
Propellant HFA-134a complies with the specification provided in the Ph.Eur. monograph for norflurane.  
Non-compendial tests methods for ‘porous particles’ and HFA-134a have been adequately described and 
validated. 
The  micronised  active  substances  are  associated  to  the  porous  particle.  During  the  review,  extensive 
characterisation of the porous particles and of their association has been performed. The surface of the 
porous  particle  is  corrugated  and  due  to  the  amphiphilic  nature  of  the  surface  the  cohesion  between 
particles  is  reduced.  The  active  substances  adhere  to  the  corrugated  particle  surface  through  a 
shape-fitting contact mechanism. The particle size and concentration in the formulation have been set 
based on development studies.  
Both  active  substances  are  micronised  and  suspended  in  the  finished  product  formulation;  therefore 
physico-chemical characterisation of the drug substances is crucial (i.e. polymorphism and enantiomeric 
purity of the two active substances at source and in the suspension have been discussed. 
HFA-134a  was  chosen  as  the  propellant  as  it  provides  good  suspension  and  aerosol  properties.  The 
suitability of the physicochemical properties as well as toxicological profile of this material for use in MDI 
products  has  been  well  established  based  upon  the  prior  approval  of  several  HFA-134a  based  MDI 
products and data from the International Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium for the Toxicology Testing of 
HFA-134a (IPACT-1). 
The relationship between the particle size distribution of the active substances and the product APSD has 
been investigated. The specification limits for particle size distribution in each active substance is justified 
and will consistently yield a finished product with an acceptable fine particle mass per actuation. 
The pharmaceutical development has been conducted according to the quality guideline on inhalation 
products (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr) and is sufficiently well described. 
Test for delivered dose uniformity (DDU) was performed to ensure that each batch delivers the labelled 
amount of the active substances and that the dose was reproducibly both within a batch (inter-variability) 
and through the usable life of the inhaler (intra-variability).  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018

The APSD was determined by Next Generation Impactor, Ph.Eur. Apparatus E. Data demonstrated that 
particle size distribution was consistent between Phase III clinical batches and final commercial batches. 
Shaking,  priming  (both  initial  and  re-priming)  and  cleaning  requirements  have  been  studied.  Low 
temperature  performance  has  also  been  studied  and  showed  that  re-priming  should  be  performed 
following short term exposure to cold temperatures. 
Compatibility with a holding chamber, Aerochamber Plus Flow-Vu Antistatic VHC has been studied.  
The  primary  packaging  is  a  pressurised  metered  dose  inhaler,  comprising  an  aluminium  pressurised 
container with an attached dose indicator, supplied with a white plastic actuator body and mouthpiece 
with  an  orange  dust  cap.  Each  inhaler  is  individually  packaged  in  a  foil  laminate  pouch  containing  a 
desiccant sachet and packed in to a carton. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. A 
satisfactory  extractable  and  leachable  study  has  been  provided.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
The  dose  indicator  uses  a  force  mechanism  to  count  actuations  and  display  advances  after  every  10 
actuations. The initial indicator count is set to 130 actuations, which allows for 120 dosing inhalations in 
addition to 4 priming actuations and 6 re-priming actuations over the course of a 30 day in-use period. 
When  only  20  actuations  remain  in  the  inhaler,  the  indicator  will  display  the  number  ‘20’  on  a  red 
background as a visual alert to patients. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: dispensing, bulk suspension preparation, canister 
preparation, canister filling, dose indicator and actuator assembly and packaging. The canisters may be 
bulk packed as an optional step. The manufacturing process is satisfactorily described. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
description of the product (visual), appearance of the formulation (visual), identification (reversed-phase 
high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  and  ion  exchange  HPLC),  total  can  assay  (HPLC), 
degradation  products  (HPLC),  DDU  through  canister  life  of  both  active  substances  and  number  of 
actuations  per  canister  (dose  unit  sampling  apparatus  and  HPLC),  moisture  content  (Karl-Fisher), 
aerodynamic particle size distribution (next generation impactor), leak rate (weight loss) and microbial 
limits test (Ph.Eur.). 
The specification parameters and limits are acceptable and in line with the requirements in the quality 
guideline on inhalation products (EMA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr). 
A risk assessment with respect to the potential presence of elemental impurities has been performed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches for each of the proposed finished 
product manufacturers, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three finished product commercial scale batches for each of the finished product 
manufacturers stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Additional data on three finished product commercial scale batches for one of the finished product 
manufacturers stored for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC/65% RH). The batches 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Due to the trends observed in the accelerated stability data, the storage condition “Do not 
store above 30°C” has been included. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
In addition, an in-use stability study was performed on 1 batch of unprotected (out-of-overwrap) product 
stored at 25°C/75% RH valve horizontal condition for a period of 3 months.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years in the original packaging, and the 
in-use shelf-life to be used within 3 months of opening the pouch, with the storage instructions “do not 
store above 30°C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. The additional precautions of “Do 
not expose to temperatures higher than 50°C. Do not pierce the pressurised container.” are also 
acceptable for a pressurised container. 
Adventitious agents 
In accordance with Directives 2001/83/EC and 2003/63/EC, starting materials, packaging materials with 
product contact, process materials, media fill components and cleaning detergents are compliant with 
chapter 5.2.8 "Minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human

2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
including description, characterization and control of the ‘porous particles’ used in the preparation of the 
suspension for inhalation has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The development of the product 
has addressed all the relevant aspects of an inhalation product and it has been conducted in line with 
guideline requirements and current practice. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Glycopyrronium and formoterol both function as bronchodilators exerting their effects via different 
mechanisms (M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, respectively). 
Glycopyrronium bromide also known as glycopyrrolate selectively bind muscarinic receptors in the lung 
tissue of rats after intratracheal administration compared to bladder and submaxillary gland tissues, and 
the effects of glycopyrrolate last for at least 24 hours. Glycopyrrolate showed no selectivity in its binding 
to M1 and M3 receptors although a 3- to 5-fold higher affinity at M3 receptors compared to M1 and M2 
receptors was observed. In studies in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the binding affinity for M1 and 
M3 receptors was similar and slightly higher than for M2 receptors. Binding affinities (pKi values) for the 
five human muscarinic receptor subtypes ranged between 10.26 (hM4) and 9.67 (hM2) with the affinity 
for hM1 and hM3 being in the middle of the range (10.09 and 10.04, respectively). 
Formoterol is a potent, selective, and efficacious β2-adrenoceptor agonist with a rapid onset, and long 
duration of action when inhaled. It is an almost full agonist at the β2-adrenoceptor. Due to its high 
β2-selectivity, formoterol produces more bronchodilation than cardiovascular effects. The primary 
pharmacological effect of formoterol is relaxation of airway smooth muscle. The smooth muscle relaxant 
effects of formoterol have been demonstrated in several in vitro experimental systems and in both guinea 
pig and human airway preparations formoterol has been shown to be highly potent with a rapid onset of 
action and a prolonged duration of action. 
Selectivity studies in isolated guinea pig trachea, or atria, revealed that formoterol is >100-fold more 
potent in inducing bronchodilation than increasing heart rate. The difference was only 10-fold under in 
vivo conditions. 
No pharmacology studies have been conducted on the combination of GP and FF as they are known to 
have different mechanisms of action. This is acceptable by the CHMP. Although both function as 
bronchodilators, GP and FF have different mechanisms of action: GP is a cholinergic antagonist with a 
strong affinity for the human M3 muscarinic receptor, whereas FF is a long-acting selective β2-adrenergic 
receptor agonist. As stated in the proposed text for section 5.1 of the SmPC, glycopyrronium has similar 
affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 as shown above. In addition it may, based on the 
differential density of muscarinic receptors and β2 adrenoceptors in the central and peripheral airways of 
the lung, be concluded that that muscarinic antagonists are likely to be more effective in relaxing central 
airways, and β2-adrenergic agonists more effective in relaxing peripheral airways, as also stated in the 
proposed text for section 5.1. 
Secondary pharmacology of formoterol and glycopyrronium are considered to be well established in the 
clinic. No additional nonclinical data for the combination is considered to be needed. 
Safety pharmacology of glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate are well known. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No specific absorption or distribution studies were conducted as part of the nonclinical program for GFF 
MDI, neither for the single component products GP MDI, or FF MDI. However, absorption has been 
demonstrated in all rat and dog toxicology studies as part of the TK analysis. Although only single point 
determinations were reported from the studies in rat due to too few time points used for sampling to allow 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 17/102 
 
 
 
 
 
calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC. In studies in dogs sufficient number of sampling 
time points were used and from these studies AUC values were reported. 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of formoterol fumarate have 
been previously submitted to support the approval of products already on the market. While 
glycopyrrolate has been studied in a range of in vitro studies to determine the binding to plasma proteins, 
metabolism and potential for interactions with CYP enzymes and drug transporters.  
The in vitro binding of glycopyrrolate to plasma proteins was not concentration dependent over the range 
2 to 500 nmol/L and the average percent unbound was 52% in human and ranged between 63 to 79% in 
other animals tested. 
The in vitro metabolism of [14C]glycopyrrolate in human and animal hepatocytes revealed that the major 
metabolic pathways of [14C]glycopyrrolate in hepatocytes were mono- and dioxygenation and 
mono-oxygenation in combination with desaturation in most species. Quantitative, but no qualitative 
differences were observed between species and no human unique metabolites were observed. However, 
no in vivo studies were performed and no data on metabolites in plasma and possible species differences 
have been studies. Glycopyrrolate showed no turn-over in either human, rat or dog lung microsomes. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Inhalation toxicology program 
The two active substances in the GFF MDI (glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate inhalation aerosol) 
drug  product, glycopyrrolate (GP) and formoterol fumarate (FF), are known active substances that are 
included in a number of approved medicinal products for human use.  
Single dose and 14-day repeat-dose inhalation toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs with FF 
and GP alone, and with the combination product GFF MDI. A 3-month dog study was performed with three 
doses of GFF MDI, a high dose of GP MDI, three doses of FF MDI, placebo and air control treatment 
groups. In addition, 6-month studies in rats and dogs with GP MDI were conducted. Both rats and dogs 
have been used in non-clinical studies with FF and GP previously and the substances are 
pharmacologically active in both species.  
GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI were formulated using the porous particle technology platform. These 
particles are comprised of DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and CaCl 2 at a 2:1 molar 
ratio. When co-suspended with micronized drug substance crystals in HFA-134a, they form a stable 
suspension MDI. DSPC and CaCl 2 have been toxicologically qualified in the repeat-dose inhalation toxicity 
program. In addition, DSPC has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a standard study package. The 
propellant used, HFA-134a, has been used in many approved products, and no further non-clinical studies 
to support its use in the present drug product are considered necessary.  
There was a change in formulation from spray dried FF to micronized FF co-suspended with spray-dried 
porous particles between the 14-day and 3-month inhalation studies. The Applicant considers the GFF 
MDI formulation tested in the pivotal 3-month dog inhalation study to be representative of the GFF MDI 
formulation used in the Phase III clinical studies. It is agreed that the formulations used for the 
non-clinical inhalation toxicology program and the phase III clinical formulation appear to be sufficiently 
comparable.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose inhalation studies up to the maximum feasible dose were conducted in rats and dogs with GP 
and FF as single substances. The acute toxicity was low in both species. No lethality occurred. GP caused 
mild redness in the nasal passages of rats, and no findings in dogs. FF caused increased BUN, creatinine 
Assessment report

Page 18/102 
 
 
 
 
 
and AST, as well as pulmonary congestion, in rats. Dogs showed increased body temperature, respiration 
and heart rate after 45 min exposure. The FF-related effects in dogs were observed at a 5-fold exposure 
margin relative to human therapeutic AUC. The combination product GFF MDI was also tested in single 
dose studies in rats and dogs. Clinical signs noted were apparently due to the FF component and occurred 
at a 3-6-fold exposure above human therapeutic AUC.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
FF inhalation studies 
Rats administered up to 153 (females) and 163 (males) µg/kg/day for 14 days showed intermittent body 
movements, interpreted as diaphragmatic spasms, which were reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
Several hematology and serum chemistry changes were observed, mostly of a small magnitude. None of 
these changes correlated with any histopathological findings, and were only statistically significant when 
compared with the vehicle control group, not with the air control group. Thus they are not considered to 
be clinically relevant. 
Dogs administered FF at > 9 µg/kg/day for 14 days showed erythema, increased heart rate and minimal 
to moderate myocardial fibrosis of the left ventricle papillary muscle. In addition, minimal to slight 
hepatocellular alteration was observed at all dose levels. The findings in the liver were reversible, but not 
the myocardial fibrosis. The heart effects in dogs were expected due to the β2-action of FF, to which dogs 
are known to be very sensitive. Sustained elevated heart rate leads to myocardial ischemia, and as a 
consequence of that focal necrosis and fibrosis. The liver finding was probably related to metabolic 
induction. 
Dogs administered FF at > 4.36 (males) and 4.53 (females) up to 14.05 (males) and 14.51 (females) 
µg/kg/day for 3 months showed increased vomiting, and increased heart rate, at all dose levels. There 
were no histopathological changes in the heart. Increased liver weight associated with minimal to mild 
hepatocellular alteration occurred in dogs treated at > 10.18 (males) and 10.46 (females) µg/kg/day. 
Females also showed increased body weight gain at 10.46 µg/kg/day. In the lung, there was an increased 
incidence of minimal focal epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia with fibrosis at the high dose level. Several 
changes were observed in hematology and serum chemistry parameters, but did not follow a clear dose 
response and were not correlated with any histopathological findings. Thus they are not considered to be 
clinically relevant. Based on the finding in the lung, the NOAEL was set at the mid dose, corresponding to 
an exposure margin 16-fold above human therapeutic AUC.  
GP inhalation studies 
Rats administered GP via inhalation up to 514 (males) and 555 (females) µg/kg/day for 14 days showed 
decreased body weight gain, which was not fully reversible, at the high dose level. Hematology changes 
(increased RBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit; all were reversible) observed at the high dose level in males 
were possibly a physiologic adaptation to lower oxygen as a result of high exposure concentrations and 
larger respiratory minute volume. Some changes in serum chemistry parameters were noted; notably 
decreased BUN in males at > 46 µg/kg/day and females at > 279 µg/kg/day. These changes did not 
correlate with any histopathological findings and were reversible; thus they are not considered to be 
clinically relevant. The NOAEL was set at the high dose.  
In the 6-month inhalation rat study with GP, using doses up to 523 (males) and 572 (females) µg/kg/day, 
the incidence of minimal epithelial degenerative changes (nose) and minimal epithelial metaplastic 
changes (larynx) was increased in the GP-treated groups as compared with controls. Minimal to mild 
alveolar macrophage accumulation was present in all groups including the vehicle control. This is an 
expected response to inhalation of an exogenous material. The histopathological changes in the nose and 
larynx are considered to be adaptive in nature, reflecting the long inhalation periods in rats, and are not 
clinically relevant. The only other effects were inconsistent changes in some hematology and serum 
Assessment report

chemistry parameters, and a few organ weight changes without dose response and lacking microscopic 
correlation. The NOAEL was set at the high dose.  
Dogs administered GP via inhalation up to 77 (males) and 83 (females) µg/kg/day for 14 days showed no 
significant effects except for a decreased body weight gain in males at the high dose level, which was 
reversible. With 3 months administration via inhalation of 89 (males) and 85 (females) µg/kg/day, 
increased vomiting was observed, as well as increased heart rate. Increased incidence of minimal alveolar 
macrophage accumulation/aggregation as compared with controls was also noted. Since this finding was 
minimal and considered to be a physiological response to inhaled foreign material the NOAEL was set at 
the high dose.  
In the 6-month inhalation dog study, dosing up to 76.5 (males) and 72.77 (females) µg/kg/day caused 
slightly increased heart rate at all dose levels (still within normal range for dogs). Decreased heart weight 
was observed in males at > 59.05 µg/kg/day, without any microscopic correlation. At the high dose level, 
there were a few changes in serum chemistry parameters (decreased potassium in males, increased 
globulins and decreased albumin/globulin ratio in females) without any associated histopathological 
changes. The uterus weight was increased in high dose dogs, without any microscopic correlation. The 
NOAEL was set at the high dose.  
GFF MDI (combination FF/GP) inhalation studies 
In rats, administration of GFF MDI up to 69/368 (males) and 73/394 (females) µg/kg/day for 14 days 
produced transient, inconsistent changes in hematology and serum chemistry parameters, and a 
transient decrease in body weight gain in males at the high dose. No other findings were observed. 
Dogs administered GFF MDI for 14 days up to 13/74 (males) and 13/75 (females) µg/kg/day showed 
increased heart rate at all dose levels. Minimal to moderate myocardial fibrosis of the papillary muscle 
(left ventricle) was observed at the mid and high dose levels. This finding was not fully reversible. Minimal 
to mild, reversible, hepatocellular alteration occurred at all dose levels. In addition, some effects on 
respiratory parameters (increased minute volume and increased tidal volume), mainly in males, were 
observed at all dose levels. These effects were reversible. The NOAEL was set at the low dose, 3/17 
µg/kg/day (both sexes).  
In the pivotal 3-month dog study with GFF MDI, increased vomiting was observed in the mid and high 
dose groups. Increased frequency of erythema was noted in the mid dose group only. Increased body 
weight gain occurred in female mid dose dogs. Increased heart rate (still within normal limits for dogs) 
was present at all dose levels (> 4.4/17 µg/kg/day in males; >4.5/18 µg/kg/day in females). There were 
no histopathological changes in the heart. Increased liver weight associated with minimal to mild 
hepatocellular alteration was observed at all dose levels in females, and in males at the low and high dose. 
Increased minute volume and breathing frequency was seen in two high dose male dogs. Increased 
incidence of minimal alveolar macrophage accumulation/aggregation was present in all dose groups 
versus controls. In addition, there was an increased incidence of minimal focal epithelial 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia with fibrosis in the lung of dogs treated at the GFF MDI high dose level. This 
finding was possibly related to persistent accumulation of foreign material within local areas of the lung 
for a relatively long time period. The only other noteworthy finding was slightly increased serum 
potassium in all dose groups. This effect did not show any clear dose response and may partly have been 
due to hemolysis in some of the samples. The NOAEL was set at the mid dose level.  
Toxicokinetics and exposure margins 
Dose response relationships with regard to pharmacokinetics were generally, but not always, observed 
across the studies. No apparent gender differences were noted. In some studies, a small amount of 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 20/102 
 
 
 
 
 
accumulation (with both substances) was observed. The exposure of FF and GP, respectively, was not 
affected when the substances were administered in combination.  
Generally, the Applicant’s proposed NOAELs can be accepted, with the exception of the 14-day dog study 
with FF, where there was no NOAEL due to findings of minimal myocardial fibrosis at the low dose level. 
Exposure at the LOAEL in the 14-day dog study was 5- to 10-fold above human therapeutic AUC. When 
dogs were administered FF for 3 months, no myocardial fibrosis occurred despite exposures up to 22-fold 
above human therapeutic AUC. This suggests a tolerance/adaptation to increased heart rate in dogs over 
time.  
In the 14-day dog study with GP, exposure at the NOAEL was 9-fold (males) and 18-fold (females) above 
human therapeutic AUC. When GP was administered for 3 months, exposure at the NOAEL (i.e the high 
dose, which was the only dose tested) was 62-fold (males) and 61-fold (females) above human 
therapeutic AUC. In the 6-month dog study, exposure at the NOAEL (the high dose) was 165-fold (males) 
and 115-fold (females) above the human therapeutic AUC.  
In the pivotal 3-month combination study with GFF MDI, exposure at the NOAEL was 22/66-fold (males) 
and 17/50-fold (females) above human therapeutic AUC.  Thus the margins between the NOAEL in the 
pivotal combination study and human therapeutic exposure are considered sufficiently large.   
No complete toxicokinetic analysis was performed on rats, neither in the studies with FF or GP alone, or 
with the combination GFF MDI. Only average plasma levels and/or C max were measured. Despite the lack 
of complete TK data, precluding calculations on margins, it is clear that exposure likely in considerable 
excess of human clinical exposure was achieved in the rat repeat-dose toxicity studies and in the rat 
carcinogenicity study.  
Genotoxicity 
For FF, a complete package of standard genotoxicity studies was conducted and the results were 
negative. Based on these results it was concluded that FF is not genotoxic.  
For GP, a complete package of genotoxicity studies, including tests for gene mutations and micronuclei in 
vitro, and micronuclei in vivo, has been performed. All tests were negative. Although exposure was not 
measured in the in vivo study, the rats were dosed at 2000 mg/kg bw and displayed clear signs of toxicity, 
indicating systemic exposure. Based on the results of the conducted genotoxicity studies, the overall 
conclusion is that GP does not have any genotoxic potential.  
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine  (DSPC), the excipient, was previously qualified in a separate 
package of standard genotoxicity studies (gene mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberration test in 
vitro, mouse micronucleus in vivo). All results were negative. The overall conclusion is that DSPC does not 
have any genotoxic potential.  
No combination genotoxicity studies were performed. In accordance with ICH M3, combination 
genotoxicity studies generally are not recommended if the individual agents have been tested according 
to current standards. No additional studies are considered necessary. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of FF was previously evaluated in 2-year inhalation studies in rats and mice to 
support as literature studies. Increased incidences of uterine leiomyomas and mesovarian leiomyomas in 
mice and rats, respectively, were observed. These tumours were linked to the β2-agonist effect of 
formoterol in rodents, causing relaxation of the uterine myofibers. In contrast, the non-pregnant human 
uterus shows little or no relaxant response to β2 agonists, indicating that the observed leiomyomas are

The carcinogenic potential of GP was evaluated in a 2-year inhalation study in Sprague Dawley rats, with 
an interim kill at 12 months. The animals were dosed with 0 (air or placebo), 151.7, 302.9 and 620.4 
µg/kg/day (males); and 165.9, 330.7 and 684.1 µg/kg/day (females). Due to high mortality in the female 
air control group, the study was terminated at week 81-82. Although the survival in the male air control 
and GP dose groups was still sufficient to support further dosing, the condition of the remaining animals 
was considered unlikely to support continuation of dosing for many more weeks. Therefore it was decided 
to not only terminate the female, but also the male groups, at Week 81.  
No neoplastic findings related to treatment with GP were identified. GP-related non-neoplastic findings 
were limited to the upper airways and lung. There was an increased incidence of squamous metaplasia in 
the larynx, at all dose levels. At the interim (12-month) examination, the incidence in the placebo and 
GP-treated groups was similar; however, at the end of study the incidence of squamous laryngeal 
metaplasia in GP-treated groups was higher than in the placebo group. Aggregation of alveolar 
macrophages in the lung was observed at similar incidences in controls and GP-treated groups. Hyaline 
degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in the nose was present at higher incidence in high dose rats at 
the 12-month interim examination, and in all GP dose groups at the end of study.  
The histopathological changes in the nose and larynx are considered to be physical effects resulting from 
the high loads of inhaled exogenous material. No treatment related proliferative changes in the nose and 
larynx were observed.  
A number of organ weight changes were observed, which to some extent were due to body weight 
changes and should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, GP was not carcinogenic in rats under the 
conditions of this study. 
Due to several deficiencies of the rat carcinogenicity study, precluding an assessment of the carcinogenic 
potential of GP, a Major Objection was raised at D120. This issue has now been resolved (see further 
under Discussion of non-clinical aspects). 
With their D150 response, the applicant submitted a 104-week mouse carcinogenicity study. The animals 
were dosed with GP at 0 (air or placebo), 347, 705 and 1460 µg/kg/day (males) and 335, 700 and 1420 
µg/kg/day (females). In contrast to the rat study, sufficient animals survived to allow for completion of 
the study. Several statistically significant differences in tumour incidence were identified in both male and 
female animals in this study. However, there was no clear dose response relationship for any of these 
tumours. 
GP-related non-neoplastic lesions were identified in the nasal cavity and glandular stomach. In the nasal 
passages, an increased incidence of hyaline degeneration of the respiratory and olfactory nasal 
epithelium was observed in all treated groups including placebo, indicating its relationship with the 
inhalation of exogenous material. However, a dose response was observed in the test article groups, and 
the severity of the degeneration tended to be higher in the high dose group, indicating a GP-related effect. 
Additional findings in the nasal cavity included an increased incidence of eosinophilic material in the nasal 
airway, and/or an increased incidence of acute inflammation. 
An increased incidence of mucosal hyperplasia of the glandular stomach was observed in GP-treated male 
and female mice. This finding was further characterized by the presence of variable mixed inflammatory 
cell infiltrates. No evidence of neoplastic progression was found in the areas of the hyperplasia at the end 
of the study.

A number of organ weight changes were observed, which to some extent were due to body weight 
changes and should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, GP was not carcinogenic in mice under the 
conditions of this study. 
Reproductive toxicity 
A complete package of reproductive toxicology studies was conducted on FF to support the original 
approval of this drug. Prolonged gestation was observed in rats, probably due to relaxation of uterine 
musculature (class effect of β2 agonists). Increased implantation loss and decreased pregnancy rates, 
indicating an adverse effect on male reproductive performance, were also observed in rats. Rabbits 
showed a slight increase in mean placental weight and a higher proportion of fetuses with subcapsular 
liver cysts at 60 mg/kg. In the rat peri-postnatal study, the incidence of total litter loss was slightly 
increased and mean pup weight and viable young at weaning were lower in treated than in control groups. 
Exposure was not measured in all reproductive toxicity studies with FF; however, adverse effects 
occurred at an AUC0-24 in the 30 (rat) or >125 (rabbit) nanomolar range, while the clinical AUC0-24 for FF 
in Bevespi is 154 pg.h/mL, corresponding to 0.18 nmol/L. Thus there is a large margin to the observed 
effects.  
Upon request from CHMP, the Applicant submitted a complete package of reproductive toxicity studies on 
GP in rats and rabbits. Limited TK analysis demonstrates sufficient exposure well above the human 
therapeutic exposure in both species.  GP was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. Negative effects on fetal 
body weight were observed, probably related to maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity 
in both species is considered to be 1 mg/kg/day, based on lower fetal weights. 
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant provided appropriate justification for not having conducted studies on juvenile toxicity, local 
tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolites and impurities.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
Glycopyrronium is not ionisable within the physiological pH range and the n-octanol/water partition 
coefficient of glycopyrronium was therefore determined in aqueous buffer at pH 7. Log Pow was 
determined to be -1.63. Formoterol fumarate is on the other hand an ionisable compound and the 
partition coefficient was therefore evaluated as a function of water pH (pH 5, 7 and 9). The 
n-octanol/water partition coefficients of formoterol fumarate as a function of water pH (log10 Dow), were 
determined to be -0.837± 0.015 (pH 5), 0.0700 ± 0.018 (pH 7) and 0.895 ± 0.0044 (pH 9). 
The log octanol-water partition/distribution coefficient values for glycopyrronium and formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate are <4.5 and both compounds are thus concluded not to be a PBT substance. 
Calculation of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The predicted environmental concentration of both formoterol and glycopyrronium, using default Fpen 
values and assuming no metabolism or removal during wastewater treatment, were 0.000096 μg/l and 
0.000144 μg/l, respectively. The PECSURFACE WATER calculated for both formoterol and glycopyrronium in 
the Phase I assessment are thus <0.01 μg/l. (see table below) 
Considering the above data, formoterol and glycopyrronium are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data  are limited but acceptable considering that FF 
and GP are well known active substances and already present in several products on the market, with 
similar or higher recommended doses compared to the present product. 
No in vivo studies have been performed with glycopyrrolate or the combination, except for TK studies 
performed as part of the toxicology studies.  
The main toxicological effect was increased heart rate in dogs, both with FF and GP alone, and given in 
combination as GFF MDI. In the shorter term (14-day) studies with FF and GFF MDI, this effect led to 
irreversible myocardial fibrosis in the papillary muscle. GP alone did not cause any histopathological 
changes in the heart. The cardiac effects in dogs were expected due to the β2-action of FF, to which dogs 
are known to be very sensitive. There was no exaggeration of this effect when GP and FF were dosed 
together. Although there was no NOAEL for myocardial fibrosis in the 14-day dog study with FF alone, no 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 24/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
myocardial fibrosis occurred in the 3-month study despite exposures up to 22-fold above human 
therapeutic AUC. This suggests a tolerance/adaptation to increased heart rate in dogs over time.  
Rats did not show any histopathological changes in the heart. The increased heart rate in dogs was not 
associated with any changes in rhytm. However, treatment with β2-agonists may theoretically precipitate 
arrhythmias, ischaemia, and congestive heart failure through β-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, 
anticholinergics such as GP could also precipitate arrhythmia through antagonism of the M2 receptor in 
the heart, leading to tachycardia by blocking the effects of acetylcholine on the sinoatrial node. ‘Cardiac 
disorders’ is included as an Important identified risk in the RMP, and appropriate warnings are inserted in 
section 4.4. of the SmPC concerning treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. From a 
non-clinical perspective, no further action is considered necessary.  
The applicant evaluated the carcinogenic potential of GP in rats and mice. Originally, only the rat study 
was submitted. Due to a number of deficiencies identified in the rat study, a Major Objection was raised 
in the D120 LoQ.  With their D150 response, the applicant submitted additional data from the rat 
carcinogenicity study, containing the requested complementary data. The following complementary work 
has been done:  
a.  Histopathological examination on tissues from preterminally euthanized/found dead animals has 
been conducted, and the findings are recorded in the pathology raw data.  
b.  Histopathological examination on all tissues from the mid and low dose groups has been 
conducted. The findings are recorded in the pathology raw data, and also incorporated in the 
histopathology summary tables. It is agreed with the Applicant that no new treatment-related 
findings have been identified.  
c.  A statistical analysis on tumor incidence has been conducted. The methods used are in 
accordance with current regulatory guidelines. In females, there was an increased incidence of 
mammary gland adenoma between the air control and the low dose group, and an increased 
incidence of thyroid c-cell adenoma between the placebo control and the mid dose group. The 
Applicant did not consider these findings related to treatment with GP, due to the lack of dose 
response. The applicant’s conclusions are agreed with.  
d.  A pathology peer-review has been conducted by an external pathologist. The extent of the 
peer-review is considered acceptable.  
In conclusion, with the additional information and revisions to the study report described above, the 
quality of the study is considered acceptable. It is agreed with the applicant that GP did not show 
carcinogenic potential in rats under the conditions of this study.  
The applicant also submitted a mouse carcinogenicity study, which showed no GP-related neoplastic 
findings.  
In conclusion, with the revisions to the rat study report and the submission of the mouse carcinogenicity 
study report, the Major Objection has been resolved. It is agreed with the applicant that GP did not show 
carcinogenic potential in these two rat and mouse inhalation carcinogenicity studies.  
Although no significant local tolerance issues were identified in the repeat dose toxicity studies submitted, 
the applicant was asked to submit exposure calculations based on applied dose relative to alveolar surface 
area to allow for a comparison of local tissue exposures. In their response, the applicant provided 
exposure safety margins based on lung surface area and predicted drug deposition in non-clinical species 
relative to anticipated clinical exposures as requested. The applicant used a patient weighing 74 kg to 
calculate lung surface area. However, it is accepted that even when recalculated for a 50 kg patient 
Assessment report

Page 25/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(predicted lung surface area ≈ 101 m2, lung surface area dose ≈ 0.36/0.19 µg/m2 GP/FF respectively) 
there are sufficient safety margins to local exposures in non-clinical studies.Formoterol and 
glycopyrronium PEC surface water values are below the action limit of 0.01 μg/l and both compounds are 
concluded not to be a PBT substance. Therefore formoterol and glycopyrronium are not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This Marketing Authorization Application concerns the medicinal product Bevespi Aerosphere 7.2 μg/5.0 
μg pressurized inhalation, suspension which is a fixed-dose combination of glycopyrronium and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate. The pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium and formoterol have been 
investigated both in healthy volunteers and in COPD patients. Studies have been performed with the 
applied fixed-dose combination but also with the corresponding monocomponents that have been 
developed by the applicant.  
All pharmacokinetic studies were performed without charcoal block. Thus, no information on lung 
deposition (efficacy) is obtained based on PK, but only information on total systemic exposure. This is 
acceptable since the final FDC formulation is used in the pivotal clinical studies and thus pharmacokinetic 
data is not used to bridge clinical data from the monocomponents to the fixed-dose combination. The 
main role of the PK data is to describe the pharmacokinetics of the FDC formulation, to assess the relative 
bioavailability of the FDC compared to the monocomponents in order to clarify if there is an interaction 
between the substances and to study the effect of a spacer on the systemic concentrations of the active 
substances. 
Bioanalysis 
Plasma concentrations of glycopyrronium and formoterol were measured using adequately validated 
bioanalytical methods. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
For studies with full pharmacokinetic profiles, pharmacokinetic parameter values were calculated by 
non-compartmental analysis (NCA). 
Population PK analyses were conducted using nonlinear-mixed-effect modelling with the SAEM algorithm 
in NONMEM  (version 7.3). PK data were pooled from patients with mild to very severe COPD, receiving 
single or multiple doses of glycopyrronium as monotherapy, formoterol as monotherapy or the 
combination therapy (n=311, glycopyrronium; n=437, formoterol).  
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
Relative bioavailability of GFF MDI compared to monocomponents and free combination 
The studies contributing relative bioavailability data of the fixed-dose combination compared to the 
monocomponens and free combination are summarised below. See Table 5 and Table 6 further below 
for a comparison across studies of relative bioavailability data for glycopyrronium and formoterol 
respectively, for the FDC compared to the monocomponents. 
STUDY PT003009 was a randomized, double-blind, five-treatment, single-dose cross-over 
cardiovascular safety study of two dose levels of GFF MDI and a supra-therapeutic dose of GP MDI in 70 
healthy adult male and female volunteers using moxifloxacin as positive control. GFF MDI, at the 
strengths of 7.2/4.8 μg (applied strength) and 57.6/19.2 μg of GP/FF per actuation and GP MDI at a dose 
of 57.6 μg of GP per actuation were used in the study. The products were given as two inhalations, thus 
corresponding to total dose of 14.4/9.6 μg and 115.2/38.4 μg, respectively for GFF MDI and 115.2 μg for 
GP MDI. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose.

Comparison of all glycopyrronium AUC parameters for GFF MDI 115.2/38.4 μg to GP MDI 115.2 μg 
suggests there is a decrease in the bioavailability of glycopyrronium when administered as a double agent 
at supratherapeutic levels. There was no significant difference in glycopyrronium C max between GFF MDI 
115.2/38.4 μg vs. GP MDI 115.2 μg as both the ratio and CI fell within conventional bioequivalence limits. 
STUDY PT003010 was a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, 4-treatment cross-over study aiming to 
characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of two doses of GFF MDI and GP MDI in 24 adult 
Japanese male or female healthy subjects using the defined doses (14.4/9.6 μg and 14.4 μg, 
respectively) and 2-fold higher doses of glycopyrronium (28.8/9.6 μg and 28.8 μg, respectively) of GFF 
MDI and GP MDI. The applied strength of GFF MDI was used (7.2/4.8 μg/actuation) as well as a higher 
strength regarding glycopyrronium (14.4/4.8 μg/actuation), both given as a dose of 2 actuations. Blood 
samples were collected pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose. The wash-out between treatments was 
7-14 days. 
When comparing both doses of GFF MDI to the corresponding dose of GP MDI AUC 0-12 h was 9-12 % lower 
for the FDC compared to the monocomponent.  
STUDY PT0030901 was a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 4-period, 4-treatment crossover 
study in 16 male and female healthy subjects comparing the safety and pharmacokinetics of GFF MDI 
(PT003) to GP MDI (PT001) and FF MDI (PT005) separately as well as to the free combination of both 
monocomponents. The doses given were GP MDI 72 µg (4 inhalations of 18 µg each), FF MDI 9.6 µg (4 
inhalations of 2.4 µg each), and the free as well as the fixed dose combination of these doses of 
glycopyrronium and formoterol (also given as 4 inhalations each). Blood samples were collected pre-dose 
and up to 12 hours post-dose. The wash-out period between each treatment was at least 7 days. 
The study showed a decrease in bioavailability of glycopyrronium for the fixed combination compared to 
the free combination or the monotherapy, while the exposure of formoterol from the fixed dose 
combination was comparable to the free combination and slightly higher than for the monotherapy. 
STUDY PT0031002 was a randomized, double-blind, chronic dosing (7 days, BID dosing except for 
Spiriva), four period, eight treatment, placebo-controlled, incomplete block crossover study comparing 
efficacy and safety of GFF MDI, FF MDI, GP MDI, US-sourced Foradil Aerolizer and Spiriva Handihaler in 
118 patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Blood samples for PK assessment were taken pre-dose 
on day 1 and pre-dose and up to 12 hours post-dose on day 7. There was a wash-out of at least 1 week 
between treatment periods. 
Following administration of GFF MDI 36/9.6 μg, AUC 0-12 and Cmax of glycopyrronium were approximately 
9 and 14% lower than those observed when glycopyrronium was administered alone (GP MDI 36 μg), 
respectively. Following administration of GFF MDI 36/9.6 μg, AUC0-12 for formoterol fumarate was within 
the 80-125% equivalence interval while Cmax was 14% lower compared to formoterol fumarate 
administered alone (FF MDI 9.6 μg).  
STUDY PT003006 was a Phase III, pivotal, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
chronic-dosing (24 weeks), placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of FF MDI 9.6 μg, 
GP MDI 14.4 μg, and GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, all administered BID, compared with Placebo MDI and Spiriva 
and to compare GFF MDI with its components in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. The dose 
was given as two inhalations of the strengths GFF MDI 7.2/4.8 μg (applied strength), GP MDI 7.2 μg and 
FF MDI 4.8 μg respectively. A total of 292 subjects participated in the PK sub-study and a total of 221 
subjects were included in the PK population. PK sampling occurred over a 12-hour-period on day 1 and on 
week 12 of dosing.

Overall, similar glycopyrronium systemic exposure was observed following dosing with GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 
μg and GP MDI 14.4 μg under both single dose and chronic dosing conditions. Comparisons between Day 
1 (Visit 4) and Week 12 (Visit 8) within a formulation for AUC0-12 and Cmax suggest glycopyrronium 
accumulated following chronic dosing with accumulation ratios for AUC0-12 and Cmax of 229.85% and 
139.52%, respectively, for GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and 199.48% and 126.10%, respectively, for GP MDI 
14.4 μg.

Overall, similar formoterol systemic exposure was observed following dosing with GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg 
and FF MDI 9.6 μg under single dose conditions. Systemic exposure after chronic dosing was also 
comparable between GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and FF MDI 9.6 μg treatments. 
The formoterol accumulation ratios for AUC0-12 and C max were 151.82% and 131.64%, respectively, for 
GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and 161.79% and 151.10%, respectively, for FF MDI 9.6 μg.

Relative bioavailability of FF MDI compared to Foradil Aerolizer 
Relative bioavailability of FF MDI was assessed in study PT0031002 (described above) as well as in two 
additional studies summarised below. See Table 7 for a summary of cross-study comparisons of the 
relative bioavailability of FF MDI vs Foradil Aerolizer. 
STUDY PT0050801 was a Randomized, double-blind, 5-period, placebo and active-controlled crossover 
multi-center study evaluating single administration of three doses of FF MDI (2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 μg, all 
doses given using a strength of 2.4 μg) in 34 male and female patients with moderate to severe COPD 
compared to US-sourced Foradil Aerolizer 12 μg (corresponding to 10 μg delivered from the mouthpiece). 
There was an interval of at least 3 days (72 hours) between doses. Blood samples were taken pre-dose 
and up to 12 hours post-dose. 
Not all comparisons of FF MDI to Foradil were within limits of bioequivalence, in particular, the comparison 
of FF MDI 9.6 µg to Foradil 12 µg was not within the acceptance limits of bioequivalence for AUC0-12, but 
the bioavailability was comparable or slightly lower from the FF MDI at equivalent doses. 
STUDY PT005003 was a Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 6-period, 6-treatment, 
placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter (3 US sites) study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Three Doses 
of FF MDI (7.2, 9.6, and 19.2 μg), in 50 Patients with Moderate to Severe COPD, Compared with 
Assessment report

US-sourced Foradil Aerolizer (12 and 24 μg Open-Label) as Active Controls. Three strengths of FF MDI 
were used, 3.6, 4.8 and 9.6 μg (the respective dose being administered as 2 actuations). Plasma samples 
were taken pre-dose and up to 12 hours post-dose. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 12 
hours post-dose. The wash-out between periods was at least 3 days but no more than 10 days. 
The increase in the exposure of formoterol after a single dose of FF MDI 19.2 μg compared to FF MDI 9.6 
μg was approximately 2-fold, suggesting a linear increase in the PK of formoterol. Similarly, the exposure 
(Cmax and AUC0-12) of formoterol increased in a proportional manner after a single dose of FF MDI 9.6 
μg and FF MDI 7.2 μg (i.e., 1.3-fold increase). 
Peak formoterol fumarate plasma concentration was reached within 1 hour following treatment 
administration; tmax = 0.9415, 0.9830, and 0.9670 hrs for FF MDI 7.2 μg, FF MDI 9.6 μg, and FF MDI 
19.2 μg, respectively; and tmax = 0.9170 and 0.3670 hrs for Foradil 12 μg and Foradil 24 μg, 
respectively. 
STUDY PT0031002, already described above, also compared FF MDI to Foradil Aerolizer at steady state. 
Results from the ANOVA of the non-dose-normalized exposure parameters of formoterol fumarate 
between the FF MDI 9.6 μg and Foradil showed that 90% CIs for the ratios of LSMs for the exposure 
parameters AUC0-12 and Cmax were within the 80-125% interval, demonstrating that the formoterol 
fumarate single component formulation (FF MDI 9.6 μg) was equivalent to the Foradil formulation 
(equivalent to a 10 μg dose of formoterol fumarate).  
A comparison of relative bioavailability results for FF MDI vs Foradil Aerolizer across studies is 
given in Table 7.

Relative bioavailability of GFF MDI with and without spacer 
STUDY PT003013 was a Randomized, Phase III, Two-period, Open-label, Chronic-dosing (7 Days), 
Multi-center (8 sites in the US), Crossover Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of 
GFF MDI in 80 male and female Subjects with Moderate to Very Severe COPD with and without a Valved 
Holding Chamber (VHC, spacer). Subjects were given GFF MDI 7.2/4.8 μg per actuation (applied 
strength) administered as 2 inhalations BID with or without Aerochamber Plus VHC for 7 days, and then 
PK sampling took place pre-dose and up to 12 hours post-dose on day 8 (first post-dose sample taken at 
2 minutes). Between treatment periods there was a wash-out of 7 to 14 days. 
Both treatments resulted in similarly shaped glycopyrronium plasma concentration-time profile on Day 8 
following chronic dosing, but higher concentrations were observed following treatment with GFF MDI with 
Aerochamber Plus VHC compared with treatment with GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC.

Pharmacokinetic profiles for formoterol following treatment with GFF MDI with Aerochamber Plus VHC and 
GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC were generally comparable on Day 8 following chronic dosing 
although treatment with GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC had a wider peak and higher 
concentrations around 1 to 2 hours post-dose.

Additional bioavailability studies 
Study PT010001 was a Phase I, Randomized, Double-Blind Within Device, Single-Dose, Four-Period, 
Six-Treatment, Cross-Over Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Three Doses of 
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol (BGF MDI), one Dose of GFF 
MDI (7.2/4.8 μg/actuation taken as a dose of 2 inhalations, lot F078), and Two Doses of Symbicort® 
Inhalation Aerosol in 84 male and female Healthy Volunteers. Blood sampling occurred pre-dose and up 
to 12 hours post-dose. There was a wash-out of at least 3 days between treatments. This study was 
included in the development of a triple combination including budesonide as well as glycopyrronium and 
formoterol (BGF MDI), and mainly compared the PK of BGF MDI to GFF MDI and Symbicort. Since GFF MDI 
was given in one treatment arm the study contributes with PK data for the applied combination product 
(GFF MDI). 
Study PT0010801 was a Randomized, Double-blind, Single Dose, Four-period, Six-treatment, 
Placebo-controlled, Balanced, Incomplete Block, Cross-over, Multi-center (6 US sites), Ascending Dose 
Study of Four Doses of GP MDI in 33 male and female Patients with Mild to Moderate COPD, Compared to 
Open Label Tiotropium 18 μg.  Four doses of GP MDI were investigated: 18, 36, 72, and 144 μg

glycopyrronium bromide, all doses provided using a GPP MDI strength of 18 μg. Pharmacokinetic 
sampling took place pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose. There was a wash-out period of at least 1 
week between treatments. Dose-proportionality of glycopyrrolate was assessed using a power model. 
This study did not include the applied fixed dose-combination GFF MDI but only the monocomponent GP 
MDI. It provided information regarding the PK of glycopyrronium from this formulation following single 
dose administration, including information regarding dose-proportionality (see sub-heading 
dose-proportionality below). The results from this study are included in the pop-PK model. 
Study PT009001 was a Randomized, Double-Blind, Chronic Dosing (28 Days), Four-Period, 
Five-Treatment, Incomplete Block, Multi-Center (20 sites in the US), Crossover Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and safety of three doses of budesonide and formoterol MDI (BFF MDI) compared to one dose of 
budesonide MDI (BD MDI), and one dose of FF MDI (9.6 μg BID taken as two inhalations of4.8 μg BID) in 
180 male and female Subjects With Moderate to Severe COPD. Samples were taken pre-dose and up to 
12 hours post-dose. Between each treatment period there was a wash-out of 14-21 days. This study did 
not include the applied fixed dose-combination GFF MDI but investigated a combination product with 
budesonide and formoterol, BFF MDI. One comparator was the monocomponent FF MDI, and thus this 
study provided information regarding the PK of formoterol from this formulation following repeated 
dosing. The results from this study were also included in the pop-PK model. 
Cross-study comparison of tmax 
Glycopyrronium 
Following inhaled administration of GFF MDI at the recommended dose in subjects  with COPD, peak 
concentrations occurred at approximately 5 minutes. Across the range of doses tested in patients and 
in healthy volunteers the median tmax ranged from 3.5 to 6 minutes following administration of GFF 
MDI (with GP MDI the median tmax ranged from 4 to 20 min). 
Formoterol 
Following inhaled administration of GFF MDI at the recommended dose in subjects  with COPD, peak 
concentrations occurred within 20 to 60 minutes. Across the range of doses tested in patients and in 
healthy volunteers the median t max ranged from 6 to 60 minutes following administration of GFF MDI 
(with FF MDI the median t max ranged from 5 to 85 minutes). 
Bioequivalence 
There was no necessity for the conduct of bioequivalence studies. Early formulations of FF MDI and 
Bevespi Aerosphere were only used in Study PT0030901 and Study PT0050801.  Thereafter, all 
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, Phase II, and Phase III studies were conducted with the final commercial 
formulation of Bevespi Aerosphere. 
Distribution 
Glycopyrronium 
Based on the population PK analysis, the population mean apparent volume of the central compartment 
(Vc/F) and apparent volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp1/F) was 741 L and 2990 L, respectively. 
The plasma protein binding was approximately 45% at 2nmol/l. 
Formoterol 
Based on the population PK analysis, the apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) and 
apparent volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp1/F) was estimated to 1030 L and 647 L, respectively. 
Assessment report

The plasma protein binding was 54.1%±3.4% for the RR enantiomer and 41.9%±2.7% for the SS 
enantiomer. 
Pulmonary deposition 
Study PT003020 was a randomized, single-blind, two-treatment, single-dose, single-centre 
placebo-controlled, crossover gamma scintigraphy study to assess the pulmonary deposition (total lung 
deposition and regional distribution) of 99mTC radiolabelled GFF MDI (7.2/4.8 µg) and 99mTC radiolabelled 
Placebo MDI in 10 healthy male subjects. The mean total lung deposition for the radiolabelled GFF MDI 
was 38.4% of the emitted dose (32.8% for placebo) while the total oropharyngeal deposition was 61.4% 
for GFF MDI (66.9% for placebo). Inner lung deposition was higher than peripheral lung deposition. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Glycopyrronium 
Metabolism is considered to play a minor role in the overall elimination of glycopyrronium.  In order to 
assess metabolic pathways of glycopyrronium, 6 adult subjects who underwent surgery for cholelithiasis 
were given a single 0.2 mg IV dose of radiolabelled glycopyrronium.  The mean urinary excretion in 48 h 
amounted to 85 % (65-97 %) of the total amount of radioactivity given. In both urine and bile, paper 
chromatography demonstrated that over 80% of the radioactivity corresponded to unchanged drug. In 
bile, 5 to 15% was detected as the alkaline hydrolysate of glycopyrronium and one additional unknown 
metabolite was also detected. These metabolites were also detected in urine [Kaltiala, 1974].  The 
pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium following intravenous administration of a 4 µg/kg dose was studied 
in 11 uraemic subjects undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation and in seven healthy control patients 
undergoing general surgery [Kirvelä, 1993].  Based on this study, the 24-h renal excretion of 
glycopyrronium (measured using a radioreceptor assay) was 7 (0-25)% in uraemic and 65 (30-99)% in 
control patients (P < 0.001) [Kirvelä, 1993].  In addition, the pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium after 
intramuscular administration of a 6µ/kg dose was studied in 8 Caesarean section patients using a 
radioreceptor assay. Based on this study, almost half of the drug (48.3%) was excreted into the urine 
within 3 hours and almost 60% (58.9%) was excreted in the urine within 8 hours [Ali-Melkkilä, 1990]. 
This evidence from literature suggests that 60 to 65% of glycopyrronium is excreted unchanged into the 
urine within 24 hours and at least 70% within 48 hours. 
At the recommended dose level (GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg), mean CL/F for glycopyrronium 
derived using NCA methodologies following single and multiple dose administration of GFF MDI and GP 
MDI was in a similar range across studies (i.e., 141 to 708 L/h for GFF MDI and 129 to 423 L/h for GP 
MDI). 
At the recommended dose level (GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg), mean half-life for 
glycopyrronium following single and multiple dose administration of GFF  MDI and GP MDI was similar 
across studies (i.e., 2.3 to 4.6 h for GFF MDI and 3.1 to 5.2 h for GP MDI, with the exception of a +higher 
mean value of 19.1 h reported in  Study PT003010 in Japanese subjects). Based on the population PK 
model, the mean apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was estimated to 124 L/h. The population mean 
terminal elimination half-life, derived with the population PK model, was approximately 15 hours. 
Although the terminal elimination half-life  from NCA of glycopyrronium appeared to be lower than from 
population PK  analysis, this was likely due to an inadequate characterization of the terminal phase at 
lower doses.

Formoterol 
The excretion of formoterol was previously studied in six healthy subjects following simultaneous 
administration of radiolabeled formoterol via the oral and IV routes. In that study, 62% of the 
radiolabeled formoterol was excreted in the urine while 24% was eliminated in the feces. 
At the recommended dose level (GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, FF MDI 9.6 μg), arithmetic mean CL/F for 
formoterol derived using NCA methodologies following single and multiple dose administration of GFF MDI 
and FF MDI was similar across studies (i.e., 118 to 191 L/h for GFF MDI and 85 to 189 L/h for FF MDI). 
At the recommended dose levels (GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg and FF MDI 9.6 μg), mean half-life for formoterol 
following single and multiple dose administration of GFF MDI and FF MDI was similar across studies (i.e., 
4.2 to 6.6 h for GFF MDI and 4.3  to 6.8 h for FF MDI). Based on the population PK model, the mean 
apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was estimated to 99 L/h. The population mean of the terminal 
elimination half-life, derived with the population PK model, was approximately 13 hours. 
Metabolism 
Glycopyrronium 
The elimination of glycopyrronium is primarily via renal excretion and to a lesser extent via metabolism. 
In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 is the predominant CYP isoform involved in the metabolism of 
glycopyrronium. 
Formoterol 
The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by 
conjugation to inactive metabolites. In vitro data indicate that the primary enzyme catalyzing the 
O-demethylation is CYP2D6 with possible contribution of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Secondary metabolic 
pathways include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Glycopyrronium is mainly renally excreted.  
The main metabolites identified for formoterol are formoterol glucuronide (FG) and O-demethylated 
formoterol (Met1). Glucuronides of Met1 and deformylated formoterol have also been found in man. The 
metabolites are inactive. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose proportionality 
Glycopyrronium exposure parameters AUC 0-12 and C max generally increased in a dose proportional manner 
within the 14.4 to 115.2 μg single dose range. It is to be noted that AUC0-t and AUC0-inf parameters of 
glycopyrronium following single dose administration of GFF MDI 115.2/38.4 µg increased in a more than 
proportional manner relative to GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg, which may be due to plasma concentrations being 
above the LLOQ during  the later timepoints following administration of high doses that allows a better 
estimation of the elimination phase.  Glycopyrronium AUC0-t  increased in a greater than dose 
proportional  manner from 14.4 to 28.8 μg after single-dose administration GFF MDI and GP MDI in 
Japanese subjects, which again may be related to concentrations being above LLOQ for longer time 
periods with the higher dose. 
Across a formoterol fumarate dose range from 2.4 to 38.4 µg delivered by FF MDI and GFF  MDI, there 
were generally dose proportional increases in formoterol AUC0-12 and Cmax  with  increasing dose.

Time dependency 
Glycopyrronium 
Median tmax for plasma glycopyrronium occurred between 0.083 and 0.100 h following single (Day 1) and 
multiple dose (Week 12) administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg and GP MDI 14.4 µg. Mean t1/2 ranged 
between 2.32-5.17 h (with the exception of a higher mean value of 19.1 h reported in Study PT003010 in 
Japanese subjects) for both tested products following single (Day 1) and multiple dosing (Week 12).

The glycopyrronium accumulation ratios of Week 12 to dose Day 1 for AUC0-12  and Cmax  were 2.3 and 
1.4, respectively, following administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg in a Phase III study (Study PT003006). 
Formoterol 
Median tmax values of plasma formoterol ranged from 0.10 to 0.583 h for GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg and were 
comparable between treatment Day 1 and Week 12 (Visit 8). Between  the tested formulations, the 
median tmax was slightly delayed for the FF MDI 9.6 µg treatment compared to the median tmax reported 
for GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg on both Day 1 and Week 12.  Mean t1/2  ranged between 4.3 to 6.8 h following 
single and multiple dose (Week 12)  administration of FF MDI 9.6 µg. 
The formoterol accumulation ratios of Week 12 to Day 1 for AUC0-12 and Cmax were 1.5 and  1.3, 
respectively, following administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg in a Phase III study (Study PT003006 [PK 
sub-study]) and suggested modest formoterol accumulation (up to 1.5-  fold mean increase) following 
chronic dosing. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Intra-subject geometric coefficients of variation (CV) for glycopyrronium and formoterol PK  parameters 
were estimated after administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg, GP MDI 14.4 µg,  and FF MDI 9.6 µg to 
subjects with COPD in Study PT003006 using linear mixed models with visit (Day 1, Week 12) as a fixed 
effect and subject as a random effect. The intra-subject CVs for glycopyrronium AUC0-12 and Cmax were 
30.1% and 43.5%, respectively,  after administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg and 48.3% and 54.9%, 
respectively after  administration of GP MDI 14.4 µg.  The intra-subject CVs for formoterol AUC0-12  and 
Cmax were 30.3% and 26.4%, respectively, after administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg and 36.7% and 
38.1%, respectively after administration of FF MDI 9.6 µg. 
Inter-subject geometric CVs were also calculated from Study PT003006. The inter-subject  CVs for 
glycopyrronium AUC0-12 and Cmax were generally similar after administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg vs 
GP MDI 14.4 µg and on Day 1 vs Week 12; values ranged from 52.4% to 64.9% for AUC0-12 and from 
79.3% to 86.9% for Cmax.  Inter-subject geometric CVs for formoterol AUC0-12 and Cmax were generally 
similar after administration of GFF  MDI 14.4/9.6 µg vs FF MDI 9.6 µg and on Day 1 vs Week 12; values 
ranged from 35.4% to  52.7% for AUC0-12 and were approximately 50% (47.9 – 51.8%) for Cmax. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The systemic exposure was generally higher for patients with COPD compared to healthy  subjects 
although data were variable and fairly limited.   In healthy subjects, single dose GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg 
mean AUC0-12 ranged from 18.2 to 29.9 pg·h/mL; single dose GFF MDI 115.2/38.4 μg and GP MDI 115.2 
μg mean AUC0-12 were 179 and 220 pg·h/mL, respectively. In patients with COPD, single dose GFF MDI 
14.4/9.6 μg and GP MDI 14.4 µg mean AUC0-12 ranged from 31.6 pg·h/mL to 47.3 pg·h/mL; single dose 
GP MDI 115.2 μg mean AUC0-12 was 398 pg·h/mL. 
Systemic exposure to formoterol was generally comparable between healthy subjects and  subjects with 
COPD: In healthy subjects, single dose GFF MDI  14.4/9.6 μg and FF MDI 9.6 μg mean AUC0-12  ranged 
from 40.7 to 55.6 pg·h/mL. In patients  with COPD, mean AUC0-12  ranged from 45.8 to 57.2 pg·h/mL. 
Population PK (popPK) analyses were performed to estimate PK parameters in COPD patients and to 
evaluate the effect of covariates. Data from seven studies in subjects with mild to very severe COPD were 
included in the analysis. For glycopyrronium, a total of 6025 plasma concentrations from 311 patients 
were included in the dataset. For formoterol, a total of 7783 plasma concentrations from 437 patients 
were included in the dataset.

In the final population PK model, glycopyrronium PK was described by a 2-compartment model with linear 
elimination and first-order absorption. Baseline bodyweight, eGFR and smoking status were identified as 
the most important covariates affecting the systemic exposure to glycopyrronium. The covariate effects 
on clearance are illustrated below. According to simulations the “worst-case” combination of covariates 
would render a 2.41-fold increase in AUC compared to the normal case. 
Formoterol 
In the final population PK model, formoterol PK was described by a 2-compartment model with linear 
elimination and first-order absorption. 
Baseline bodyweight and smoking status were identified as the most important covariates affecting the 
systemic exposure. The covariate effects on clearance are illustrated below. According to simulations the 
“worst-case” combination of covariates would render a 1.82-fold increase in AUC compared to the normal 
case.

Impaired renal function 
No formal study in patients with renal impairment has been made. The population PK analysis indicated 
that impaired renal function had an influence on the clearance of glycopyrronium, which is expected since 
glycopyrronium is renally excreted. The PK dataset used to build the population PK model, included 
subjects with a reduced renal function down to what is classified as moderate renal impairment. According 
to the population model, Cmax and AUC would be increased by approximately 9.6% and 36% in patients 
with severe renal impairment compared to normal controls. In the SmPC (section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2), 
caution for use in patients with severe renal impairment and on dialysis is included. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No study has been performed with GFF MDI in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is 
cleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and is thus not expected to be 
significantly affected by impaired hepatic function. Formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic 
metabolism, thus an increased exposure can be expected in subjects with severe liver impairment. 
Gender and race 
A cross-study examination of the NCA results demonstrated that Japanese compared to Western healthy 
subjects had similar or higher systemic exposures of glycopyrronium and similar exposures of formoterol 
after single dose administration of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 µg (ie, 14.4 μg glycopyrronium, equivalent to 18 μg 
glycopyrrolate, and 9.6 mg formoterol). 
The population PK analyses did not indicate gender or race as clinically meaningful covariates. However, 
the high frequency of white (93% in glycopyrronium dataset; 94% in formoterol dataset) does not contain 
sufficient information to evaluate race as a covariate.

Interactions 
In vitro 
Glycopyrronium 
Victim: In vitro data indicate that glycopyrronium is a substrate for OCT1/2 and MATE1/2K. The effect of 
inhibition of the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1 in vivo, is supported with literature data on a DDI 
study with cimetidine. 
Perpetrator: In vitro data indicate that glycopyrronium does not induce or inhibit CYP isoenzymes. 
Formoterol 
The potential for drug-drug interaction with formoterol is low. 
In vivo 
Glycopyrronium-formoterol 
Overall, no interaction was detected following co-administration of glycopyrronium and  formoterol 
fumarate based on PK endpoints derived using NCA methodologies. 
The relative BA of plasma glycopyrronnium and/or formoterol AUC0-12  and Cmax  were  generally 
comparable for GFF MDI vs. the monoproducts (GP MDI or FF MDI) based on  NCA analysis of data from 
studies in healthy subjects (PT003009 and PT003010) and  subjects with COPD (PT0031002 and 
PT003006). 
One exception was Study PT0030901, where comparative BA was not observed between glycopyrronium 
from GFF MDI and the monoproducts (GP MDI). This is potentially  explained by the use of the initial 
formulation for GFF MDI and FF MDI, the treatment doses were administered as four actuations (ie, each 
subject received eight actuations at each treatment visit; four per active treatment and/or four  per 
placebo), and the sample size (N=16 subjects) was smaller than subsequent studies. 
Glycopyrronium – cimetidine 
Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium. In 
a published drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers [Dumitras 2013], cimetidine, an inhibitor of 
OCT2, increased total exposure (AUClast) to inhaled  glycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal 
clearance by 23%.  It was an open-label, two-period, crossover study in 20 healthy subjects where a 
single-dose of 100µg glycopyrronium was inhaled alone and on day 4 of a 6-day treatment with oral 
cimetidine (800 mg BID). Based on the magnitude of  these changes, no clinically relevant drug 
interaction is expected when inhaled glycopyrronium is co-administered with cimetidine or other inhibitors 
of OCT2. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Following therapeutic doses of inhaled GFF MDI in COPD patients in study PT003006 (14.4µg/9.6 µg BID 
for 12 weeks) AUC0-12 values of 93 ±58 pg*h/ml and Cmax values of 29 ±20 pg/ml were reached for 
glycopyrronium. For formoterol, the corresponding values were 77 ± 32 pg*h/ml and 13 ± 6 pg/ml. This 
corresponds to a mean daily human AUC of 186/154 pg*h/mL. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 43/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bevespi Aerosphere contains two bronchodilators: glycopyrronium (a LAMA) and formoterol (a LABA) 
with a rapid onset of action. 
Bevespi Aerosphere contains two bronchodilators: glycopyrronium a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(also referred to as an anticholinergic) and formoterol a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist with a rapid 
onset of action.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Glycopyrronium has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it 
exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to 
bronchodilation. Formoterol causes direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle as a consequence of the 
increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate through activation of adenylate cyclase. The combination of 
these substances with different mechanisms of action would result in additive efficacy compared to use 
with either component alone. 
Because of the differential density of muscarinic receptors and β2-adrenoceptors in the central and 
peripheral airways of the lung, muscarinic antagonists are more effective in relaxing central airways, and 
β2-adrenergic agonists are more effective in relaxing peripheral airways; relaxation of both central and 
peripheral airways with combination treatment may contribute to its beneficial effects on lung function.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Absorption 
Frequent early sampling was generally performed in the PK studies which is critical to 
studyglycopyrronium Cmax. It would however have been advisable with a longer sampling time than 12 or 
24 hours considering that the extrapolated areas were generally rather large. 
There is a tendency for a slightly lower AUC of glycopyrronium from the fixed-dose combination compared 
to the monocomponent, since the results for AUC0-12 are below the lower limit of the acceptance criteria 
80-125% in most studies. It should however be noted that this effect is most pronounced in study 
PT0030901 (50% lower exposure) which was performed with a previous formulation of GFF MDI and thus 
these results are not entirely relevant for the current formulation. With the current formulation, the 
exposure was up to 15% lower with the FDC compared to the monocomponent. However, following 
repeated dosing in study PT003006 the comparison is within the conventional acceptance limits for 
bioequivalence. Overall, it is agreed that comparable systemic exposure of glycopyrronium has been 
demonstrated between GFF MDI and GP MDI. Thus, there are no indications that formoterol significantly 
affected the exposure of glycopyrronium from the fixed-dose combination. 
Overall, it is agreed that comparable systemic exposure of formoterol has been demonstrated between 
GFF MDI and FF MDI. Thus, there are no indications that glycopyrronium significantly affected the 
exposure of formoterol from the fixed-dose combination. 
In study PT005003 and PT0031002, the 90% CI for the test/reference ratio for AUC0-12 and Cmax were 
within standard bioequivalence criteria when comparing FF MDI 9.6 µg to US-sourced Foradil Aerolizer 12 
µg following single-dose and at steady-state respectively. In study PT0050801 the results were not within 
bioequivalence for AUC0-12 and showed approximately 15% lower exposure of FF MDI compared to 
Foradil. However, this study was performed with a previous formulation of FF MDI that was not included 
in other studies. Taken together, equivalent systemic exposure of FF MDI 9.6 µg compared to Foradil 12 
µg has been demonstrated. It should be noted that since administration occurred without activated

charcoal blockade, this is relevant from a safety perspective but not from an efficacy perspective (lung 
deposition). 
For glycopyrronium, AUC0-12h was 16% higher and Cmax was 25% higher when GFF MDI was administered 
with compared to without spacer (Aerochamber Plus) following repeated dosing for 7 days in study 
PT003013. This increase in exposure is not considered to be clinically relevant. For formoterol, the results 
for AUC0-12h and Cmax were within standard bioequivalence acceptance criteria, and thus the use of 
Aerochamber Plus did not affect the systemic exposure of formoterol. Conclusions regarding efficacy 
cannot be drawn based on pharmacokinetic data since the study was performed without activated 
charcoal blockade. See discussion regarding the submitted efficacy data in the Clinical section. 
Peak concentrations of glycopyrronium occurred rapidly, usually around 5-6 minutes (in most studies, 
initial sampling took place at 2 and at 5 or 6 minutes post-dose). For formoterol, there was a somewhat 
larger variability in time to peak exposure, with t max generally occurring within 20 to 60 minutes. 
It is agreed that no formal bioequivalence studies were necessary since the final commercial formulation 
was used in almost all pharmacokinetic and clinical studies and since there is no bridging to an approved 
monocomponent product. 
Elimination 
It should be noted that the extrapolated AUC was generally quite large for both substances in the studies 
assessing PK (sampling 12 or 24 hours) and thus the parameters dependent on the terminal elimination 
phase of the profile, for example half-life and CL/F, may not be adequately determined. It is for example 
noted that there was a very large range of mean CL/F values for glycopyrronium seen in the PK studies 
(141 to 708 L/h for GFF MDI and 129 to 423 L/h for GP MDI). However, for Oxis Turbuhaler the terminal 
half-life of formoterol after inhalation is estimated to be 17 hours, i e largely in line with the results from 
the pop-PK model.  
Dose-proportionality and time dependency 
The applicant states that AUC0-12 and Cmax of formoterol demonstrated a linear relationship across doses 
of 2.4 to 9.6 in study PT0050801. However, the slope has not been reported and it can be seen that when 
the dose increases 4 times the AUC increases 3.2 times which would indicate a slightly less than 
dose-proportional increase. However, this study was performed with a previous formulation with FF MDI. 
For glycopyrronium in study PT0010801 the slope has been reported and is approximately 1 and thus 
indicates dose-proportionality. Considering all data provided, it can be concluded that AUC0-12 and Cmax 
increased in an approximately dose-proportional way for glycopyrronium and for formoterol fumarate. 
There are no data indicating time dependency PK of glycopyrronium and formoterol. 
Special populations 
The applicant has submitted population PK models (one for glycopyrronium, and one for formoterol). The 
population PK models are used for estimates of PK parameters and to evaluate the effect of covariates on 
the PK of the two compounds. Of particular importance, is the use of the population PK model to support 
the recommendation in patients with reduced renal function. 
Since an increased exposure can be expected in subjects with severe liver impairment, a recommendation 
regarding caution in these subjects has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Interactions 
Overall, it is agreed that comparable systemic exposure of glycopyrronium and formoterol has been 
demonstrated between GFF MDI and the monocomponents. Thus, there are no indications that formoterol

and glycopyrronium significantly affected the exposure of each other when given as a fixed-dose 
combination. 
The study published by Dumitras et al, 2013 aimed to assess the clinical significance of inhibition of 
OTC21 and MATE1 using cimetidine as a model inhibitor. It is agreed that this interaction is not clinically 
relevant.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the clinical pharmacology properties of glycopyrronium and formoterol have been appropriately 
described. The results are adequately described in the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program described in this application is comprised of 18 studies that evaluated 
the efficacy of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and/or FF MDI in 5212 subjects with COPD. In addition a new pivotal 
study (PT003014 a 24 week study with 1756 patients included) was presented and in the last round of 
responses another two studies PT010006 and D5970C00002. The latter of these is presented as a draft 
report only. Of these 19 four were regarded pivotal; besides PT003014 two 24-week studies PT003006 
and PT003007 and one 28-week III extension study PT003008. These latter studies are also referred to 
as PINNACLE 1, 2 and 3. 
The Phase I/IIa and Phase IIb dose-ranging studies consisted of 3 randomized, single-dose, double-blind, 
efficacy and safety studies and 6 randomized, chronic-dosing (7- or 14-day), double-blind, efficacy and 
safety studies in subjects with COPD. All studies employed a cross-over design, with the exception of 
Study PT003003 which was parallel in design. Phase I/IIa and Phase IIb dose-ranging studies were 
conducted for GP MDI and FF MDI to support the selection of the appropriate dose and dosing regimen for 
Phase III as monotherapies and as components of GFF MDI. In addition, dose-ranging studies were 
performed for GFF MDI to ensure that the appropriate dose of the combination was selected for evaluation 
in Phase III studies. 
Considering the totality of the data, FF MDI 9.6 μg was considered non-inferior to Foradil 12 μg (i.e. 
approved therapeutic dose) and was thus selected for further studies. GP MDI showed a flat dose/effect 
relationship as investigated in a wide range of doses. Based on the totality of data the second highest of 
the investigated doses (18 μg) was selected for further studies. Studies with the fixed combination 
confirm the combined effect as the GFF MDI performed better (measured as FEV1 AUC0-12) than the 
respective mono-components. 
In addition a total of 10 clinical studies that include Bevespi Aerosphere, GP MDI, and/or FF MDI treatment 
arms were ongoing at the time of the data cut-off date for this submission of 31 Dec 2016. These include 
Studies PT003014 (a 24-week Phase III study), PT003017 (a Phase III study assessing cardiovascular 
haemodynamics), PT003018 and PT003019 (Phase III studies with imaging parameters), PT010005, 
PT010006, PT010007, and PT010008 (Phase III studies of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol 
fumarate [BGF] MDI, which include a Bevespi Aerosphere arm), and PT009002 and PT009003 (Phase III 
studies of budesonide and formoterol fumarate [BFF] MDI, which include an FF MDI arm).

Three main studies and one extension study are described in this section. As studies PT003006 and 
PT003007 are of similar design they are described together in this section.  
2.5.2.1.  Studies PT003006 and PT3003007 
Title of Study PT003006 
A Randomized, Double-Blind (Test Products and Placebo), Chronic Dosing (24 Weeks), 
Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, Multi-Center Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of PT003, PT005, 
and PT001 in Subjects With Moderate to Very Severe COPD, Compared With Placebo and Spiriva® 
Handihaler® (Tiotropium Bromide 18 μg, Open-Label) as an Active Control. 
Title of Study PT003007 
A Randomized, Double-Blind (Test Products and Placebo), Chronic Dosing (24 Weeks), 
Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, Multi-Center Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of PT003, PT005, 
and PT001 in Subjects With Moderate to Very Severe COPD, Compared With Placebo. 
Studies PT003006 and PT003007 were regarded pivotal for this application. Both were Phase III, 
pivotal, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, chronic-dosing (24 weeks), 
placebo-controlled studies to assess the efficacy and safety of FF MDI 9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg, and GFF 
MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, all administered BID, compared with Placebo MDI and to compare GFF MDI with its 
components in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD; Study PT003006 also evaluated open-label 
Spiriva (18 μg, once-daily [QD]) as an active control.  
Methods/ study design 
The studies assessed the long-term (24 weeks) bronchodilator efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GFF 
MDI 14.4/9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg, and FF MDI 9.6 μg administered BID compared with Placebo MDI and 
Spiriva (applicable for study 003006 only). The studies also allowed for comparison of the efficacy and 
safety of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg to its components (GP MDI 14.4 μg and FF MDI 9.6 μg) to assess the 
relative contribution of each component to the combination and to confirm that the combination is safe 
and effective for subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.

For study PT003007, the arm of Spiriva does not exists.  
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were current or former smokers with an established clinical history of COPD 
characterized by airflow limitation, and had moderate to very severe COPD defined as FEV1/FVC ratio of 
<0.70 and FEV1 <80% predicted normal value. Notably, all centres in both studies were non-European. 
The applicant has provided a justification and states that they believes that the patient populations 
included in the clinical program are sufficiently representative of the population of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in the EU to allow extrapolation based upon consideration of 
epidemiology, ethnic factors, the study demographics and entry criteria for the pivotal studies, the 
practice of medicine, and the wealth of evidence from other published large COPD clinical trials that 
demonstrated the lack of a relevant difference in efficacy or safety between US and EU populations 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 treatment arms in a 7:6:6:6:3 ratio (the arm with Spiriva 
Handihaler is applicable for study PT003006 only) with fewer subjects being assigned to the Placebo MDI 
arm and more subjects being assigned to the GFF MDI arm.  
Objectives/endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective of study PT1003006 and PT1003007 was to compare the efficacy of 
treatment with GFF MDI, FF MDI, and GP MDI to Placebo MDI and to compare the efficacy of GFF MDI to 
its components on lung function using trough FEV1 in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. 
The secondary efficacy objectives of studies were: 
• 
• 
To compare the effects of GFF MDI, GP MDI, FF MDI, and Placebo MDI on dyspnoea using the 
Self-administered computerized Transition Dyspnea Index (SAC-TDI) focal score (outside of the 
US) 
To compare the effects of GFF MDI, GP MDI, FF MDI, and Placebo MDI on quality of life using the 
change in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score

• 
• 
• 
To compare the effects of GFF MDI, GP MDI, FF MDI, and Placebo MDI on symptoms using the 
change in rescue salbutamol use as an indirect measure of symptom control 
To determine the time to onset of action on Day 1 (Visit 4) 
To compare the efficacy of GFF MDI and GP MDI vs Spiriva in terms of change in trough FEV1 
(Study 003006 only) 
There were two co-primary endpoints:  
•  Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks. 
•  SAC-TDI focal score over 24 weeks. 
Sample size 
It was estimated that a sample size of 2054 subjects in study PT003006 and 1614 subjects in study 
PT003007, allocated as 514 subjects in the GFF MDI arm, 440 subjects in the GP MDI, FF MDI and Spiriva 
treatment arms, and 220 subjects in the Placebo MDI arm provided approximately 91% power with Type 
I error controlled at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect differences for all 5 primary comparisons if the 
true differences from Placebo MDI were 90 ml for FF MDI, 100 mL for GP MDI, and 150 ml for GFF MDI 
resulting in corresponding differences between GFF MDI and FF MDI and GP MDI of 60 ml and 50 ml, 
respectively, in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at Week 24 and approximately 99% power for morning 
pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks. 
Randomisation  
Subjects were randomized in a 7:6:6:6:3 scheme (GFF MDI, GP MDI, FF MDI, Spiriva [Study PT003006 
only], and Placebo MDI). 
Blinding (masking) 
The treatments were administered in a blinded manner. Blinding with regard to the active comparator 
(Spiriva) was not performed in order to avoid 'dummy/dummy' allocations due to the complications that 
an alternative device was required for Spiriva dosing. A placebo Spiriva would have been difficult to 
create, and Spiriva dosing was QD instead of BID.  In the event the identity of the study drug became 
necessary, unblinding was to be performed using the IWRS. Spiriva, Ventolin HFA, and Atrovent HFA were 
provided open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The primary objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy of GFF MDI compared to its individual 
components and Placebo MDI as well as the efficacy of FF MDI and GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI. 
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 was analysed using a repeated measures 
(RM) linear model. Data from all study treatments were included in the modelling. The linear RM analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model included baseline FEV1 and reversibility to Ventolin HFA as continuous 
covariates and visit, treatment, the treatment by visit interaction, smoking status at baseline, and ICS 
use at baseline as categorical covariates. Baseline was defined as the average of all available evaluable 
60- and 30-minute values obtained prior to dosing at Day 1 (Visit 4). An unstructured correlation model 
was used to model additional autocorrelation within subject. Contrasts were used to obtain estimates of 
the treatment differences at Week 24 and over the entire 24 weeks. The analysis of the average over the 
entire 24 weeks is a secondary endpoint for the US approach and a co-primary endpoint for the EU

approach. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
produced for each treatment difference. All non-missing data were used. 
Additional supportive analyses of morning pre-dose trough FEV1 included the change from baseline at 
Week 24 and over the entire 24 weeks in the PP Population and treatment differences over Weeks 12 to 
24 and at individual time points estimated by the RM ANCOVA model. 
The difference between treatments in SAC-TDI focal score over 24 weeks was evaluated using a similar 
linear RM ANCOVA approach as for the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1. The BDI 
was included as a continuous covariate replacing baseline FEV1 in the model. At each visit, if a response 
to any of the 3 questions was missing, then the focal score was also considered missing. As additional 
supportive analyses, the difference between treatments at each of the individual post-baseline visits was 
also evaluated and summarized.  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis findings to 
missing data. The estimand of interest in this study was the effect of treatment compared to control (for 
example, GFF MDI vs GP MDI) at Week 24 or over 24 weeks of treatment. Since the primary analyses of 
morning pre-dose trough FEV1 and SAC-TDI used maximum likelihood based approaches, they were valid 
under the missing at random assumption [Little, 2002]. In order to evaluate the robustness of the 
findings to this assumption, sensitivity analyses were performed under varying assumptions for data 
considered likely to be missing not at random (MNAR). The first approach implemented in this study was 
the use of pattern-mixture models (PMMs). 
The statistical analysis method chosen for the co-primary endpoints will treat missing data from drop-outs 
and discontinued subjects as missing at random (MAR), meaning that the reason for missing data will not 
be dependent on treatment. Depending on the amount of missing data and the pattern this assumption is 
not always eligible. A pattern mixture model was implemented as an analysis method considering data 
missing not at random (MNAR). This method is considered suitable to investigate the robustness of the 
results and providing a more conservative estimate of the treatment effect. The missing data is 
categorized based on reason for missing and determined as MAR/MCAR or MNAR. The MNAR data was 
penalized in a tipping point analysis based on the PMM. 
The multiplicity issue with many tests has been adequately handled within product using a combination of 
a sequential procedure for the co-primary endpoints and Hochberg’s procedure for the secondary 
endpoints. Comparisons versus Spiriva are not strictly controlled. 
The studies are powered for all primary comparisons and the specified multiplicity strategy. However it 
should be considered that the type I error control is maintained only within product and not over all tests. 
The sample size was increased in both protocol amendments to adjust for changes in the primary 
endpoint and analyses. The studies are powered for the US primary endpoint.

Of the subjects screened, 2103 were randomized into Study PT003006. The corresponding figure for 
Study PT003007 was 1615 subjects. Early discontinuation was reported for a total of 408 subjects 
(19.4%) and 307 (19 %) respectively and the percentage of subjects with early discontinuation was 
highest in the Placebo MDI group (27.3% and 26.3 %). The most common reasons for early 
discontinuation were generally similar across treatment groups, although the percentages varied by 
treatment. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This multi-centre study was 
planned to be conducted at approximately 160 sites, contributing approximately 10 to 20 subjects per 
site. Across these sites, it was planned that approximately 2054 subjects with moderate to very severe 
COPD would be randomized into the study to provide approximately 1650 subjects to complete the study. 
This study included 2 sub-studies: a 12-hour PFT sub-study and a PK profile sub-study. A subset of 
approximately 100 subjects randomized to each active treatment arm and approximately 50 subjects 
randomized to Placebo MDI were required to participate in the 12-hour PFT sub-study involving collection 
of PFTs over 12 hours at Visit 4 (Day 1, Randomization) and Visit 8 (Week 12). 
Baseline data  
The mean age of subjects in the study was 62.8 and 62.9 years with a slight majority of subjects in the 
<65 years age group (54.9 % and 54.6 %). A slight majority of subjects were male (56.4 % and 55.1 %) 
and most were Caucasian (91.4% and 90.1 %). Demographic data were similar across treatment groups. 
Across all subjects, the majority of subjects were current smokers (54.1 % and 53.2%) with a mean of 
50.9 and 51.7 pack-years smoked. Most subjects had moderate (53.1 % and 53.0 %) or severe (40.9 % 
and 42.7 %) COPD; the mean duration of COPD was 7.6 and 7.9 years. The severity and duration of COPD 
for subjects were similar across treatment groups. Mean FEV1 was 1.296 L and 1.311 L (43.59 % and 
44.48 % predicted) pre-Ventolin HFA and 1.516 L and 1.511 L (51.09 % and 51.37 % predicted)

post-Ventolin HFA at Screening. Across all subjects, mean percent reversibility post-Ventolin HFA for 
FEV1 was 19.7% and 19.2 % (a mean difference of 219.1 mL from pre-Ventolin HFA values). Mean FEV1 
and FVC values, both pre- and post-bronchodilator, were similar across treatment groups at Screening. 
The mean total CAT Score for all subjects was 18.4 and 18.7; the majority of subjects had a total CAT 
Score of ≥10 (87.0 and 87.4%). The mean MMRC Grade for all subjects was 1.8 and 1.7; a slight majority 
of subjects had an MMRC Grade ≥2 (57.5 % and 56.6%). The majority of subjects did not use ICS at 
Baseline (64.1 % and 62.1%).  Within the past 12 months prior to enrolment, a total of 25.1 % and 22.1 
% of subjects were treated for a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation with systemic (oral or 
intravenous) corticosteroids and/or antibiotics.  
These baseline characteristic data were similar among treatment groups. A total of 81.8 % and 86.0 % of 
all subjects used at least 1 prior COPD medication. Baseline medical therapy was reported in 82 % of 
patients. The most commonly used prior COPD medications across all subjects were salbutamol (63.9 % 
and 70.4 %) and tiotropium bromide (26.0 % and 20.6%). Salmeterol/fluticasone (20.7 % and 19.3 %) 
and budesonide/formoterol (13.4 % and 15.2 %) was less common. The use of prior COPD medications 
was generally similar across treatment groups. In study 003006 and 003007 respectively, a total of 72.2 
% and 73.6 % of subjects had cardiovascular risk factors of interest, the most common of which were 
hypertension (55.7 % and 57.0 %) and high total cholesterol (50.3 % and 49.7%). Cardiovascular risk 
factors were generally similar across treatment groups.  
Outcome and estimation  
GFF MDI demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with Placebo MDI and both 
components for the first co-primary endpoint (i.e. change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 
over 24 weeks). The differences were 158 ml [132;183] in study PT003006 (see Table 11 and Table 12 
Overview of Results of Co-Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for Comparisons Involving 
Open-Label Spiriva (Study PT003006, ITT Population)) and 129 ml [103;155) in study PT003007 (see 
Table 13) respectively. For the second co-primary endpoint (SAC-TDI focal score over 24 weeks), a 
difference of 0.47 [0.21; 0.72) and 0.33 [0.11; 0.56] points from placebo, respectively, was recorded. 
The two components added both to this effect with similar magnitude. Among secondary endpoints could 
be mentioned SGRQ total score over 24 weeks which decreased 2.39 [4.07; 0.71) and 1.66 [3.34; 0.02] 
points respectively compared to placebo.

2.5.2.2.  Study PT003008 
Methods/study design 
This study PT010008 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, chronic-dosing, 
active-controlled, 28-week safety extension study of the 2 pivotal 24-week safety and efficacy studies 
(Studies PT003006 and PT003007).  
Objectives 
This study was designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI 
in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD over a total observation period of 52 weeks. Open-label 
Spiriva was included as an active control.  
Study participants 
To be eligible for this study, a subject must have completed participation in Study PT003006 or Study 
PT003007. Until the targets for enrolment into the study were met, 90% of subjects in the GFF MDI, FF 
MDI, and GP MDI arms who met the inclusion criteria were randomly selected for invitation into the study. 
The patients remained on their assigned treatment.  
Outcome/endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 55/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1. Among 
secondary endpoints were SAC-TDI focal score, peak change from baseline in FEV1 within 2 hours 
post-dose, change from baseline in SGRQ total score and change from baseline in average daily rescue 
Ventolin HFA use. To ensure retained randomisation the ITT Population was defined as all subjects who 
were randomized to active (non-placebo) treatment in Study PT003006 or Study PT003007 and received 
at least 1 dose of the study treatment in that study regardless of whether or not they participated in Study 
PT003008. 
Sample size 
A total of 893 subjects were treated. The majority of subjects in each group completed Week 52 in Study 
PT003008 (86.0% to 87.8% across treatment arms).  
Results 
The results were mainly consistent with the 24 week data. Change from baseline in morning pre-dose 
trough FEV1 over 52 weeks was 65 ml [49;81] better in the GFF group compared to FF. The corresponding 
figures were 57 ml [41; 73] and 25 [6; 45] for GP and Spiriva respectively. The difference in SAC-TDI 
focal score over 52 weeks was 0.16 [0.02; 0.31], 0.21 [0.07; 0.36] and 0.08 [-0.10; 0.26) for GFF vs FF, 
GP and Spiriva respectively. 
2.5.2.3.  Study PT003014 
Study PT003014 was a randomized, double-blind, chronic dosing (24 Weeks), placebo-controlled, parallel 
group, multi-centre study to assess the efficacy and safety of FF MDI 9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg, and GFF 
MDI 14.4/9.6 μg in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD, compared with placebo. The study 
design was similar to the previous studies PT003006 and PT003007.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as in study PT003006 and PT003007 
Objectives 
The study assessed the long-term (24 weeks) bronchodilator efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GFF MDI 
14.4/9.6 μg, GP MDI 14.4 μg, and FF MDI 9.6 μg administered BID compared with Placebo MDI. The study 
also allowed for comparison of the efficacy and safety of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg to its components to assess 
the relative contribution of each component to the combination and to confirm that the combination is 
safe and effective for subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.  
Outcome/Endpoints 
The primary endpoint in EU was the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 measured 
over 24 weeks. The secondary endpoints were:  
• TDI focal score over 24 weeks 
• TDI focal score over 24 weeks in the Symptomatic Population 
• Peak change from baseline in FEV1 within 2 hours post-dosing over 24 weeks 
• Change from baseline in SGRQ total score over Weeks 12 to 24 
• Change from baseline in SGRQ total score over Weeks 12 to 24 in the Symptomatic Population

• Time to onset of action on Day 1   
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1756 subjects were randomized into Study PT003014. The number of subjects randomized and 
treated in each treatment group were as follows: GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg (555 subjects), FF MDI 9.6 μg (483 
subjects), GP MDI 14.4 μg (480 subjects), and Placebo MDI (238 subjects). 
Conduct of the study  
The majority of subjects in each treatment group completed Week 24 (range: 84.0% to 89.0%). Early 
discontinuation was reported for a total of 228 subjects (13.0%) and the percentage of subjects 
discontinuing the study early was highest in the Placebo MDI group (16.0%), followed by the FF MDI 9.6 
μg (13.7%), GP MDI 14.4 μg (13.3%), and GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg (11.0%) groups. Overall, the most 
common reasons for early discontinuation were subject discretion (72 subjects [4.1%]), 
protocol-specified criteria (52 subjects [3.0%]), and AEs (47 subjects [2.7%]). The most common 
reasons for early discontinuation for all subjects were generally similar across treatment groups. 
Baseline data  
This study population included 714 subjects from Asia, 476 subjects from Europe, 70 subjects from 
Russia, and 496 subjects from the US. Overall, the mean age of subjects in the study was 64.2 years, with 
subjects evenly distributed between the <65 years and ≥65 years age groups. Most subjects were male 
(74.1%), White (56.7%) or Asian (40.2%), and non-Hispanic (97.9%); the mean BMI of subjects was 
26.4 kg/m2. Demographic data were similar across treatment groups. 
The mean total CAT score for all subjects was 15.0; subjects were evenly distributed between CAT scores 
<15 and ≥15, and approximately three-quarters of all subjects (76.1%) had CAT scores ≥10. The mean 
mMRC grade for all subjects was 1.7; over half of subjects had an mMRC grade ≥2 (54.8%). The majority 
of subjects did not use ICS at baseline (69.4%). In the ITT Population, most subjects had moderate 
(59.8%) or severe (35.5%) COPD based on GOLD severity classification. Approximately two-thirds of 
subjects in each group were in GOLD Category B (low exacerbation risk, more symptoms). The mean 
duration of COPD was 6.2 years. The severity and duration of COPD for subjects were similar across 
treatment groups. Across all subjects, mean FEV1 was 1.324 L (47.04% predicted) pre-Ventolin HFA and 
1.526 L (54.24% predicted) post-Ventolin HFA at Screening. In addition, mean FEV1 was 1.314 L 
(46.68% predicted) pre-Atrovent HFA and 1.509 L (53.59% predicted) post-Atrovent HFA at Screening. 
Across all subjects, mean FVC was 2.803 L pre-Ventolin HFA and 3.114 L post-Ventolin HFA. Across all 
subjects, mean percent reversibility post-Ventolin HFA for FEV1 was 17.4% (a mean difference of 201.9 
mL from pre-Ventolin HFA values). A total of 44.3% of subjects demonstrated reversibility to Ventolin 
HFA. 
A total of 82.5% of all subjects used ≥1 prior COPD medication. The most commonly used prior COPD 
medications across all subjects were salbutamol (40.8%), tiotropium (33.1%), and budesonide (19.9%). 
A total of 47.9% of all subjects used ≥1 concomitant COPD medication. The most commonly used 
concomitant COPD medications across all subjects were budesonide (19.5%) and fluticasone propionate 
(9.4%). The use of prior and concomitant COPD medications was generally similar across treatment 
groups.

Supportive studies  
In addition to the dose finding and pivotal phase III studies there are five supportive studies presented. 
Two are similarly designed 24 h spirometry studies (PT003011 and PT003012) conducted with the 
primary objective being determination of the 24-hour efficacy (lung function) profile of GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 
μg BID relative to Placebo, based on FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), in subjects 
with moderate to very severe COPD following chronic dosing (4 weeks). The AUC of FEV1 was significantly 
higher in the test group compared to placebo and a clear difference was seen also relatively tiotropium 
which was used as a comparator in one of the studies. 
In a third supportive cross-over study (PT003013) the efficacy, safety and PK of GFF MDI with and without 
a spacer (Aerochamber Plus VHC).The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects of GFF 
MDI with Aerochamber Plus VHC relative to GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC based on FEV1 
AUC0-12 after 7 days of treatment. A total of 80 subjects were randomized and 70 subjects (87.5%) 
completed treatment in both treatment periods. The recorded difference was numerically small with 
slightly higher FEV1 with the spacer (LS mean difference 22 ml; ratio 101.4 [100.1; 103]. There is no 
confirmation of assay sensitivity in this study. 
Another study was presented in response to the list of questions.  
Study PT010006 was a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, multicentre study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (BGF MDI), 
GFF MDI, and budesonide and formoterol fumarate (BFF MDI), compared with budesonide and formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate (Symbicort Turbuhaler) as an active control in subjects with moderate to very severe 
COPD with FEV1 ≥25 to <80% and CAT ≥10 despite 2 or more inhaled bronchodilators. Subjects were 
randomized in a 2:2:1:1 scheme. Formal comparisons in this study were focused upon BGF compared to 
the other treatment arms and between BFF MDI and Symbicort but can also be used to provide a 
comparison of GFF MDI to Symbicort. The Symbicort treatment was given open-label while the other 
treatment arms were blinded. The patients were categorized as either GOLD B (88%) or GOLD D (11%) 
using history of COPD exacerbation in the prior year, and therefore suitable to be treated with LAMA/LABA 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018

(GOLD 2018). Approximately 26% of the patients had an exacerbation in the previous year. In addition, 
the majority (71.8%) of patients were treated with ICS either alone or in combination with other therapies 
prior to enrolment. Findings for TDI focal score are presented below for the GFF MDI versus Symbicort 
Turbuhaler comparison in Table 16. The tables present results for both the over 24 weeks analysis (the 
secondary endpoint timeframe for the EU in study PT010006), and over Weeks 12 to 24 analysis (the 
secondary endpoint timeframe for SGRQ in the GFF MDI studies already included in the submission). 
The change from baseline in TDI focal score over 24 weeks and over Weeks 12 to 24 for GFF MDI was 
greater than that seen for Symbicort Turbuhaler (Table 16). The treatment comparisons reached nominal 
statistical significance in favour of GFF MDI at the 5% level in the Weeks 12 to 24 analysis.  
The proportion of TDI responders (≥1 unit) was also greater for GFF MDI than Symbicort Turbuhaler over 
24 weeks (GFF MDI 9.26% higher) and over Weeks 12 to 24 (GFF MDI 8.96% higher). The treatment 
comparisons at both timepoints reached nominal statistical significance (subject to the same caveats as 
described above). In SGRQ total score and SGRQ responders, GFF MDI and Symbicort Turbuhaler 
performed similarly with mean improvements from baseline of over 6 units for each treatment. A total of 
45.68% of GFF MDI patients in PT010006 were SGRQ responders (≥4-unit improvement) over Weeks 12 
to 24, which is similar to the response rate in PT003014 of 46.91%. 
Non-inferiority margins were not defined for the GFF MDI versus Symbicort comparison in Study 
PT010006.   
Table 16 TDI focal score (units) in Study PT010006 (mITT population).  
In addition, preliminary information from another study (D5970C00002) has recently become available 
to provide additional answer to the major objection on efficacy on symptoms raised by the CHMP. 
AERISTO was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study of GFF MDI versus UMEC/VI in 
patients with moderate to very severe COPD.  
The primary objective was to assess the effects of GFF MDI relative to UMEC/VI on lung function. The 
primary endpoints were trough FEV1 over 24 weeks, where non-inferiority was assessed, and peak 
change from baseline in FEV1 over 24 weeks, where non-inferiority and superiority were assessed. 
Additional lung function measures as well as symptom-based variables (TDI, early morning symptoms as 
assessed by the early morning symptoms of COPD instrument [EMSCI]) were included as secondary 
endpoints. Time to first moderate or severe exacerbation was included as an exploratory endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 75/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the primary objectives, GFF MDI demonstrated non-inferiority to UMEC/VI on peak FEV1 , but did not 
demonstrate superiority on peak FEV1 or non-inferiority on trough FEV1. Amongst secondary endpoints, 
GFF MDI was nominally superior to UMEC/VI terms of the speed of onset at 5 minutes on Day 1. For TDI 
and EMSCI the confidence intervals were within the respective non-inferiority margins. There was no 
difference between GFF MDI and UMEC/VI for moderate to severe COPD exacerbations. The data are 
presented below in Table 17. 
Table 17 Primary endpoints GFF MDI vs UMEC/VI comparisons (PP analysis set) 
The observed change from baseline in spirometry endpoints for GFF MDI in this study was notably 
inconsistent with that observed in previous studies (PT003006, PT003007, PT003014 and PT010006).  In 
this study, for the full analysis set, the LS mean change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 
over 24 weeks for the GFF MDI group was 78 mL, which was more than 40% less than that observed in 
previous studies, where the LS mean changes from baseline were between 135 mL and 150 mL in the GFF 
MDI arm. In addition, although still being non-inferior to UMEC/VI, the LS mean peak change from 
baseline in FEV1 within 2 hours post-dosing over 24 weeks of 299 mL for the GFF MDI group was 
approximately 20% lower in this study compared with previous studies, where the LS mean change from 
baseline was between 366 mL and 375 mL. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program is comprehensive with a number of smaller studies and three pivotal 
controlled phase III trials (Studies PT003006, PT003007 and PT003014) and an open extension study 
(PT003008). 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 76/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal studies are overall designed according to the applicable guideline (i.e Clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
(EMA/CHMP/483572/2012). The studies were multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
chronic-dosing (24 weeks) studies with placebo control and with the mono-components as additional 
controls. In study PT003006 a separate LAMA control (tiotropium) was also included. Thus the study 
design allows for estimation of both the total effect level relatively placebo and the contribution of each of 
the two mono-components. 
Of the subjects screened 2103 patients were randomized into study PT003006. The corresponding 
number for study PT003007 and PT003014 was 1615 and 1756 respectively. The patients included 
represented a population with moderate to very severe disease as measured by lung function (mean FEV1 
was 43.59 %, 44.48 % and 47 % predicted pre-bronchodilation respectively) and symptoms (mean CAT 
Score was 18.4, 18.7 15.0 and mean MMRC grade was 1.8, 1.7 and 1.7 respectively). 
The studies PT003006 and PT003007 were conducted predominantly in the US whereas PT003014 was 
multinational with a large group of European subjects recruited.  
The study objectives for PT003006 and PT003007 include two co-primary endpoints, one related to lung 
function (change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks) and one to symptoms 
(SAC-TDI focal score over 24 weeks measuring dyspnoea). The same endpoints are used in PT003014 
although TDI was a secondary endpoint in this study and measured as the standard 
interviewer-administered TDI while PT003006 and PT003007 used the self-administered computerized 
(SAC) version of the TDI (SAC TDI).  
Exacerbation rate is not including among key endpoints and this objective is not expected to be covered 
considering the relatively short observation period (24 weeks) and the fact that repeated exacerbations 
was not specified as an inclusion criteria. Thus the studies cover two main aspects of disease expression 
whereas the third aspect (exacerbation rate) is not covered. 
The extension study (PT003008) included 893 subjects which had completed studies PT003006 or 
PT003007 and were allocated to one of the active treatments in these studies. The blinding was kept and 
all patients continued on the same treatment. Of the included patients 779 completed the study which 
covered a treatment period of totally 52 weeks (combined length of studies). However, in accordance with 
the statistical plan, the primary population for analysis was the ITT population for the combined studies 
i.e. the population that received at least one dose of treatment in studies PT003006 or PT003007. This 
population is much larger (totally 3209 subjects). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A clinically relevant effect was recorded with regard to lung function in the pivotal trials as the difference 
vs placebo in mean change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 was 158 ml (95 % conf inf 
[132;183]),129 ml [103;155] and 155 ml [129;180]) in study PT003006, PT003007 and PT003014 
respectively i.e. more than the 100 ml generally considered as MCID. The two mono-components both 
contributed with similar magnitude to this effect. This effect on lung function is supported by results from 
secondary endpoints. A subgroup analysis indicated as expected that the effect is more prominent in the 
group of patients with a certain level of reversibility (> 12 %) in FEV1 following administration of a short 
acting bronchodilator.  
The differences recorded for the co-primary endpoint SAC-TDI focal score in studies PT003006 and 
PT003007 was minor. The difference vs placebo was 0.47 (95 % confidence interval [0.21;0.72] and 0.33 
[0.11;0.56] )in study PT003006 and PT003007 respectively. This is less than the MCID of 1.0. The 
mono-components appeared to contribute equally to this effect but the magnitude is small and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 77/102 
 
 
 
 
 
differences are not statistically significant. This modest effect on symptom control is confirmed by data on 
the secondary endpoint SGRQ total score which was -2.39 [-4.07; -0.71] and -1.66 [-0.34; 0.02)] 
respectively, i e. less than the MCID of 4.0. The studies were conducted in US and the patients were using 
rescue medication to control symptoms to a large extent. Therefore it is important to note that  use of 
rescue medication was reduced in the active treatment arms. In the third study (PT003014) a somewhat 
better effect on disease symptoms was recorded as the difference vs placebo for TDI focal score was 0.80 
[0.47; 1.13] and for SGRQ -3.5 [-5.18; -1.82] which, although still below the MCIDs is more in line with 
what could be expected from a LABA/LAMA combination. Post hoc analyses indicates that the effect was 
more prominent in subjects with high symptom score at baseline (MRC  ≥ 2).  
There was a discussion with regard to whether the LAMA component (GP MDI) performs adequately in this 
fixed combination. In one of the pivotal trials (PT003006) tiotropium was added as a control. In this study 
tiotropium appeared to perform somewhat better than GP MDI. The difference in FEV1 [95 % CI] was 31 
ml [10; 52], in SAC-TDI 0.19 [-0.01; 0.4] and in SGRQ -1.43 [-2.81; 0.05] i.e. a consistent difference 
although minor and statistically uncertain.  
For symptoms, where the overall response was weak in this study, this difference is nevertheless notable. 
Higher doses of GP investigated in dose finding studies did not indicate a better effect; the dose effect 
relationship appears flat. Nevertheless, in these studies lung function only was investigated with a short 
study duration (7 days) and the contribution from the GP component was overall modest. There is an 
indication of an unexpected weaker response for the LAMA component in this combination but 
interpretation of these data should be made with caution as this comparison was not a primary objective 
of the study. Overall it can be concluded that glycopyrronium contributed to the overall effect on lung 
function but with some uncertainties on whether this effect translates into an effect on symptoms similar 
to that of other LAMA/LABA containing products. There is no information available with a direct 
comparison to another LAMA/LABA besides some preliminary data on where the effect of lung function 
was unexpectedly low. These data cannot be regarded as pivotal.         
The pivotal clinical trials were conducted over 24 weeks and were not designed to measure any effects on 
exacerbation rate. To capture this parameter there would be a need to expand the study duration to 52 
weeks and this is done with the extension study PT003008. However this study included only a fraction of 
the patients from the two pivotal trials and in accordance with the statistical plan the primary analysis was 
made on the ITT population from the pivotal trials. Thus most patients included in the analysis had a 
considerably shorter treatment period than 52 weeks. This makes the results difficult to interpret. Thus no 
conclusion could be drawn on effect on exacerbation rate in this application. This is adequately addressed 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
However, overall, as the efficacy of each active component is well known in COPD, the CHMP by majority 
considered the efficacy acceptable, despite its limitations, and took into account the significant and 
clinical relevant improvement on FEV1 and partial effect on the TDI in its final decision.  
As the product is to be used with or without a spacer device a study was conducted to compare the 
systemic exposure, efficacy and safety in a cross-over study with and without the use of Aerochamber 
Plus VHC. There is no confirmation of assay sensitivity allow a firm conclusion on efficacy in this study 
however when assessed together with the pharmacokinetic data available, it can be concluded that 
Bevespi Aerosphere may be used together the spacer Aerochamber Plus VHC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Studies conducted were adequately designed for demonstration of efficacy. Effect as measured by use of 
the primary endpoint related to lung function was adequately shown. The result as recorded by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 78/102 
 
 
 
 
 
endpoint related to symptom control was less convincing. There is information available to allow for a 
conclusion on an acceptable although modest effect on symptoms but insufficient data to draw 
conclusions on exacerbations.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The combination glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate consists of two active substances with different 
modes of action, one as muscarinic antagonist and one as a beta2 agonist.  
The active substances are well known from other products already marketed and for which the safety 
profile has been previously well-characterised. Glycopyrronium is approved in many countries in multiple 
formulations for different indications, including an inhaled formulation for COPD. Formoterol fumarate is 
approved in many countries worldwide for use in asthma and COPD as a monotherapy product and in 
combination with inhaled corticosteroids. More recently, a number of other fixed-dose LAMA/LABA 
combinations have been approved globally for use in patients with COPD, including in the EU.  As of the 
data cut-off date of 31 Dec 2016, GFF MDI was approved but not yet marketed in the United States (US). 
The clinical development program supporting the safety of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI includes a total 
of 24 completed clinical studies: 18 studies in subjects with COPD, 1 study in subjects with asthma, and 
5 studies in healthy subjects.  
Figure 5 Overview of Clinical Development Program for GFF MDI, GP MDI and FF MDI 
Safety data were integrated for the following 3 study groupings: 
• 
• 
Phase III Pivotal Studies Grouping (PT003006 and PT003007) 
Phase III Pivotal and Long-term Studies Grouping (PT003006, PT003007, and PT003008)  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 79/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Phase IIb Chronic Dosing (7- to 14-day) Studies Grouping (Studies PT001002, PT001003, 
PT0031002, PT003003, PT003004, and PT003005). 
Additional Phase III/IIIb studies were conducted, but not integrated with the pivotal and long-term 
extension Phase III studies because they were of shorter duration and/or crossover design. These 
included two 4-week, double-blind, crossover, lung function studies (Studies PT003011 and PT003012), 
a 7-day, open-label, crossover, valved holding chamber study (Study PT003013), and a 4-week, 
open-label, single-arm dose indicator study (Study PT003016). Safety data is summarised individually for 
these studies in the submission. Nevertheless, studies from the Phase IIb Chronic Dosing (7 to 14 day) 
Studies Grouping and non-integrated studies are of very short duration with crossover design there is 
difficult to allocate adverse event to a particular treatment. 
The choice of study grouping method is considered adequate. However, the potential for diluting of safety 
signals due to separately analysis from the non-integrated safety database was questioned. The applicant 
presented a clear overview of the breakdown of exposure to GFF MDI showing limited exposure to GFF 
MDI from the non-integrated studies (12.4 patient-years versus 439.0 and 585.5 patient years of 
exposure from the integrated Phase III studies), that is unlikely to have impacted on the overall safety 
assessment.  
In conclusion, the core safety assessment is based primarily on safety results from the 2 pooled pivotal 
Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group, 24-week efficacy and 
safety studies (Studies PT003006 and PT003007) and a double blind, active-controlled, 28-week 
extension of both pivotal studies (Study PT003008). Pooling was deemed appropriate as the studies were 
of similar study design and had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, endpoints, and frequency of 
assessments for efficacy and safety. Therefore, the approach for the integrated analyses is supported. 
Ongoing Clinical Studies 
A total of 10 clinical studies that include GFF MDI, GP MDI, and/or FF MDI treatment arms were ongoing 
at the time of the data cut-off date for this submission of 31 Dec 2016. These include Studies PT003014 
(a 24-week Phase III study), PT003017 (a Phase III study assessing cardiovascular hemodynamics), 
PT003018 and PT003019 (Phase III studies with imaging parameters), PT010005, PT010006, PT010007, 
and PT010008 (Phase III studies of Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoteral Fumarate [BGF] MDI, 
which include a GFF MDI arm), and PT009002 and PT009003 (Phase III studies of Budesonide and 
Formoterol Fumarate [BFF] MDI, which includes an FF MDI arm).  
It is noted that at the time of the data cut-off (31 Dec 2016) the following has been reported: 
- In PT003014 study, a total of 133 non-fatal TEAEs and 3 TE death 
- In PT010005 study, a total of 551 non-fatal TEAEs and 20 TE deaths with 3224 subjects enrolled  
- In PT010006 study, a total of 125 non-fatal TEAEs and 7 TE deaths with 1289 subjects enrolled  
- In PT010008 study a total of 22 non-fatal TEAEs and 1 TE death with 555 subjects enrolled. 
- In PT009002 study, a total of 49 non-fatal TEAEs and 2 TE deaths with 823 subjects enrolled.  
During the procedure, the applicant was asked to confirm whether any additional safety signals have 
emerged in the ongoing studies including post-marketing cases since the submission of this application. 
A safety signal of urinary retention with likely causal association to GFF MDI was identified and is included 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Patient exposure 
Throughout the clinical program, 197 healthy subjects and 4358 subjects with COPD have been exposed 
to one or more doses of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and/or FF MDI.  
Overall, the mean age of subjects in the Phase III Pivotal Studies was 62.9 years with the majority of 
subjects in the <65 years age group (54.7%). The majority of subjects were male (55.8%), White 
(90.8%), and non-Hispanic (96.8%). Most subjects were enrolled at sites in the US (96.0%). A 
justification for the use of US subjects in this MAA based on the ICH E5 guidance was provided. The mean 
body mass index across all subjects was 28.2 kg/m2. The majority of subjects did not use inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) at baseline (63.4%) and were current smokers (53.7%). The mean number of pack 
years smoked across all subjects was 51.3 years. Demographic and other baseline data were similar 
across treatment groups. 
A total of 72.8% of subjects had cardiovascular risk factors of interest, the most common of which were 
hypertension (56.3%) and high total cholesterol (50.1%). Cardiovascular risk factors were generally 
similar across treatment groups. 
2816 subjects with COPD were exposed to treatment for up to 24 weeks: 1036 in GFF MDI, 890 in GP MDI 
and FF MDI groups. Of these, 722 subjects were exposed to treatment for up to 52 weeks: 290 in GFF 
MDI, 219 in GP MDI and 213 in FF MDI groups. 253 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment with GFF 
MDI. 
722 subjects were exposed to treatment for up to 52 weeks: 290 in GFF MDI, 219 in GP MDI and 213 in 
FF MDI groups with 352.7 mean exposure days in GFF MDI.  
A significant number of patients have been exposed to the GFF MDI in an acceptable timeframe of 24-52 
weeks. The exposure is in line with recommendations of the ICH guidelines (E1) and the safety database 
is considered to be adequate.  
Adverse events 
Summaries of AEs and SAEs are based on treatment-emergent (i.e. newly occurring or worsening during 
treatment period). AEs whose start dates were before the firs dose date were considered as medical 
history, unless the event met the criteria of SAE.

AEs were reported at similar incidences in the GFF MDI (59.6%), FF MDI (56.9%), GP MDI (56.2%), 
Placebo (57.6%), and Spiriva (62.7%) groups. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. 
Most frequently reported AEs, occurring in ≥2% of subjects, were in the SOCs Infections and infestations; 
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal-; Gastrointestinal- and Musculoskeletal disorders. The most 
frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, cough, upper respiratory tract infection and; urinary tract 
infection. The incidences of these events were generally similar to the Spiriva. 
The most commonly reported AEs, which occurred at higher incidences in GFF MDI compared with 
Placebo, were cough (4.0% vs 2.7%), dry mouth (1.3% vs 0.2%), headache (1.4% vs 0.9%), muscle 
spasm (1.5% vs 0.9%), anxiety (1.3% vs 0%) and tremor (0.8% vs 0%). Dyspnoea and hypertension 
occurred at lower incidences in the GFF MDI compared with Placebo (2.3% vs 4.3% and 1.2% vs 3.6%, 
respectively).

PT003006/PT003007/ PT003008 
In the integrated Phase III Pivotal and Long-term analysis AEs were reported at slightly higher incidences 
in the GFF MDI (64.6%) and Spiriva (69.2%) groups compared with FF MDI (60.4%) and GP MDI 
(59.9%). Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity across all treatment groups. 
AEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations; Respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders; Gastrointestinal-; Musculoskeletal- and Connective tissue disorders. The most 
commonly reported AEs in the GFF MDI (in ≥3.0% of subjects) were nasopharyngitis (6.8%), cough 
(4.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.8%), urinary tract infection (3.5%), COPD (3.2%), and 
sinusitis (3.2%). The incidences of the AEs in the GFF MDI were generally similar in the FF MDI, GP MDI 
and Spiriva, with the exception of a lower incidence of nasopharyngitis in the GP and a higher incidence 
of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Spiriva. 
Use with Aerochamber Plus VHC: 
In Study PT003013, during the 7-day Treatment Periods, TEAEs were reported in 27 subjects (33.8%) 
treated with GFF MDI: 17 subjects (23.0%) treated with GFF MDI with Aerochamber Plus VHC and 16 
subjects (20.5%) treated with GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC. The incidences of SAEs, 
drug-related TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were low and similar between treatments. 
Three subjects (3.8%) receiving GFF MDI experienced SAEs. One subject (1.4%) treated with GFF MDI 
with Aerochamber Plus VHC reported an SAE of pancreatitis, 1 subject (1.3%) treated with GFF MDI 
without Aerochamber Plus VHC reported an SAE of respiratory distress, and 1 subject (1.3%) treated with 
GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC reported an SAE of deep vein thrombosis. All of the SAEs were 
considered to be unrelated to study drug by the Investigator. Two subjects (2.5%) experienced AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug. One subject (1.4%) treated with GFF MDI with Aerochamber Plus 
VHC discontinued study drug due to an AE of pancreatitis and 1 subject (1.3%) treated with GFF MDI 
without Aerochamber Plus VHC discontinued study drug due to an AE of respiratory distress. 
Following on from the concerns raised in 2012 by the CHMP/SAWP that the systemic exposure to 
formoterol and glycopyrronium was higher when administered via mono-component inhalers without a 
spacer than when administered via the combination inhaler without a spacer, it was agreed that further 
testing of MDI with and without spacers would be required. 
In Study PT003013, it is noted that the incidence of TEAEs reported was slightly higher in patients using 
GFF MDI with Aerochamber Plus VHC versus patients using GFF MDI without Aerochamber Plus VHC. In 
the context of the existing PK data which suggests a potentially higher glycopyrronium exposure rate 
when the Aerochamber Plus VHC is used concomitantly, the applicant was asked to further discuss the 
potential for an increase in exposure related adverse events when the Aerochamber Plus VHC is used with 
GFF MDI. The applicant has outlined their justification to support their position that the modest increase 
in glycopyronnium exposure does not raise a safety concern. In integrated Phase II analysis with a wide 
range of glycopyrronium doses no apparent dose ordering for treatment-emergent AEs across the GFF 
MDI doses was seen. The potential increases in glycopyrronium exposure suggested by study PT003013 
would be equivalent to approximately 45 μg, which is within the range of approved dose for this substance 
in other products.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events  
PT003006/PT003007 
Serious AEs were reported at similar incidences in GFF MDI (7.7%), FF MDI (7.4%), GP MDI (8.2%), 
Placebo (7.0%), and Spiriva (8.0%) groups. The most frequently reported serious AEs and the only ones 
that occurred in ≥1% of subjects in any treatment group were COPD and pneumonia. COPD and 
pneumonia occurred at similar incidences in GFF MDI versus placebo group (2.2% vs 2.5% and 1.0% vs 
0.9% respectively). There is an imbalance in occurrence of pneumonia between treatment groups, with 
higher incidences in GFF MDI (1.0%) and GP MDI (1.2%) compared with the FF MDI (0.4%) and Spiriva 
(0.2%) groups, however these results appear to be chance findings. 
There are seen 4 cases of respiratory failure, two of them acute, in GFF MDI group versus 0 in placebo and 
applicant was requested to comment on these differences. The cases were reviewed in detail. The events 
start day is between 37-148 days after treatment initiation with multiple co-morbidities presented in 
three cases.  As the events of respiratory failure are expected in this population, we concur with the 
applicant that the small differences across treatment groups do not raise any particular safety concerns. 
PT003006/PT003007/ PT003008 
In the 52-week Treatment Period, serious AEs were reported at generally similar incidences across 
treatment groups (GFF MDI 11.0%, FF MDI 8.8%, GP MDI 10.1%, Spiriva 10.9%). Similarly to 24 weeks 
treatment period, the most frequently reported serious AE was COPD reported in higher incidence in GFF 
MDI (3.1%) and GP MDI (3.4%) compared with FF MDI (2.1%) and Spiriva (2.7%); and pneumonia 
reported at higher incidences in GFF MDI (1.4%) and GP MDI (1.6%) compared with FF MDI (0.4%) and 
Spiriva (0.2%) groups.   
The incidences of the other AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were low (<1.0%) and similar 
across treatment groups. 
Deaths 
The total number of deaths is very small and it makes it difficult to draw any conclusion. 
A total of 14 treatment-emergent deaths were reported in the Phase III Pivotal Studies. It is noted that 4 
deaths occurred pre-treatment. 
Five patients died in the GFF MDI group, 3 of them were sudden with cardiovascular origin (MI, cardiac 
arrest and death not otherwise specified), 1 for metastatic neoplasma and 1 for gunshot. One patient died 
in FF MDI for peripheral artery thrombosis, one patient in GF MDI for aspiration pneumonia and one in 
placebo group for death of unknown circumstances. Four patients died in Spiriva group, 1 for sudden 
cardiac death and 3 for other causes of overdose/suicide/self-injury. Two additional deaths occurred 
during the 28-week treatment period; one in the FF MDI and one in Spiriva groups.  
Two additional deaths were reported from Phase IIb Chronic dosing studies, one sudden death in subject 
with FF MDI and cardiac arrest in subject with GFF MDI treatment.  
In addition, the applicant provided details of treatment-emergent fatal cases in ongoing clinical studies. 
Assessment report

Table 17 Treatment-emergent Deaths in Ongoing Clinical Studies 
The number of fatal cases reported in the initial feedback from the ongoing clinical studies is 33, with 
three fatal cases (two cardiovascular and one respiratory) considered to be possibly related to the study 
drug.  
In D120 LoQ the applicant was asked to present a cumulative overview and detailed causality assessment 
of the fatal cases reported to date with GFF MDI (to include additional data from ongoing clinical studies, 
post-marketing and Open Breathe programme, in addition to the existing data on fatal cases). A detailed 
overview of fatal cases, with many related to the occurrence of serious cardiovascular events, was 
presented. Nevertheless it t is difficult to draw firm conclusions on causality due to the presence of 
confounding factors in many cases or limited data. Many patients had either co-morbid medical problems 
including cardiovascular disease or had background risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The use of GFF 
MDI did not appear to have an additive effect on cardiovascular risk. However, it is recommended that this 
Assessment report

topic is kept under close review, given that patients receiving GFF MDI in the future are likely to be older 
patients many of whom will have significant co-morbid medical problems and risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Pharmacologic class effect of LABA include cardiovascular (increased heart rate, prolonged QT interval, 
cardiac rhythm abnormalities, palpitation, and myocardial ischemia), metabolic (low potassium and 
elevated glucose) and tremor effects. 
Pharmacologic class effect of LAMA include cardiovascular effects (atrial arrhythmias) ocular disorders 
(e.g. blurred vision), urinary retention, gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. constipation), along with 
anticholinergic effects including dry mouths. 
Regarding cardiovascular events, this is an area of special interest based on the established 
pharmacological profile of both actives in GFF MDI. COPD is a major risk factor for most cardiovascular 
diseases, and both LAMAs and LABAs have the potential to impact on cardiac function. In addition, the 
profile of COPD patients potentially using GFF MDI on a long term basis is likely to have comorbid cardiac 
conditions, in addition to other risk factors for cardiac rhythm disturbance. 
For cardiovascular events, higher incidence of tachyarrhythmia SMQ was reported in treatment groups 
versus placebo and Spiriva (GFF MDI 15(1.4%), FF MDI 13(1.5%), GP MDI 13(1.5%), Spiriva and placebo 
3(0.7%) in both). 
Regarding QT prolongation a similar incidence was reported in GFF MDI 1(0.1%) and placebo group 
2(0.5%) and the numbers are very small.  
Higher incidence of stroke was reported in GFF MDI 1(0.1%) and GP MDI 4(0.4%) compared to placebo 
0. The numbers are very small and no firm conclusion can be drawn, however it seems that there is no 
evidence of accumulative effect of GP MDI and FF MDI when prescribed together.  
Overall, the data shows that some events are as expected in higher event rates in the active treatment 
groups than in the placebo and are compatible with either anticholinergic or β 2-agonist pharmacology 
effect. However the incidence across the active treatment groups was generally similar and there is no 
evidence of an additive effect on adverse events of the two actives being administered in one combination 
inhaler. 
MACE 
Cardiovascular safety remains an area of special interest. 
There were19 subjects who experienced a MACE. 
The incidence of events was slightly higher in GFF MDI compared to placebo, however the numbers are 
very low to draw any firm conclusion (GFF MDI 0.7%, FF MDI 0.3%, GP MDI 0.6%, Placebo 0.5%, Spiriva 
0.4%).The most frequently reported event, and the only one reported for more than 1 subject in any 
treatment group, was acute myocardial infarction. 
During 52-week Treatment Period, the incidences of MACE were slightly higher for GPP MDI and Spiriva 
groups (GFF MDI 0.8%, FF MDI 0.4%, GP MDI 0.6%, Spiriva 0.9%). The most frequently reported PT 
were acute MI (GFF MDI 0.2%; FF MDI 0.1%; GP MDI 0.1%, Spiriva: 0), cardiac failure (GFF MDI 0; FF 
MDI 0; GP MDI 0.1%; Spiriva: 0.4%), and MI (GFF MDI 0.2%; FF MDI 0; GP 0; Spiriva 0.2%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 85/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant was asked to provide a cumulative overview of the serious and fatal cases relating to the 
MACE and cardiac arrhythmias, with detailed causality assessment. Among the 39 cases, 33 were cardiac 
disorder cases and 6 CNS vascular disorder cases. No event occurs immediately after the start of 
treatment. It is difficult to draw firm conclusion on causality due to the presence of many co-founding 
factors with co-morbid medical problems including cardiovascular disease or background risk factors for 
CV disease.  The SmPC reflects adequately available safety information. Safety concern of “Serious 
cardio- and cerebrovascular events” is an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Mean (SD) changes from baseline to end-of-treatment for laboratory parameters has been presented for 
the Phase III Pivotal studies and over 52 weeks study population in tabular form. The tables are omitted 
in this report. 
Haematological data did not reveal any clinically relevant mean changes from baseline to end of 
treatment for any parameter in any treatment group. 
For chemistry parameters, small and generally similar changes from baseline to end of treatment were 
observed across all groups in total bilirubin. For AST, ALT and GGT, slightly higher increases were 
observed in GFF MDI; FF MDI and Spiriva groups compared with the GP MDI and Placebo, these 
differences however, are not clinically meaningful. These findings are similar to those observed in the 52 
weeks study population. No notable changes from baseline to end-of-treatment in glucose and in 
potassium were observed for any treatment groups either in Phase III Pivotal studies or over 52 weeks. 
No notable change from baseline to end-of-treatment in kidney function assessed via e-GFR was 
observed for any treatment groups either in Phase III Pivotal studies or over 52 weeks. 
The incidence of clinically significant hyperglycaemia were similar across all treatment groups, and same 
trend was seen during 52-week treatment with incidence range of 2.4% to 3.2%.however it should be 
mentioned that subjects were not required to fast prior to blood sampling. 
The incidences of clinically significant abnormalities in GGT, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total 
bilirubin were low (≤2.6% in Phase III, ≤2.7% in long term) and similar across all treatment groups 
during Phase III and also during 52-week treatment period. 
The incidence of clinically significant hypokalaemia was low (≤0.3%) and similar across all treatment 
groups, except GP group, in which no subject had clinically significant hypokalaemia. The incidence was 
low also during 52-week treatment with 5 subjects (0.5%) in the GFF MDI, 4 subjects (0.9%) in Spiriva 
and 1 subject (0.1%) in the FF MDI group. Among subjects not using diuretics the incidence of clinically 
significant hypokalaemia was seen in 4 subjects (0.5%) in GFF MDI versus 0 in the FF MDI or GP MDI 
group in 52 week treatment.  
Small differences seen in laboratory value for kidney disease with 4 cases in treatment groups (3 in GFF 
MDI and 1 in GP MDI) versus no case in placebo do not raise any particular safety concern.   
ECG parameters 
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate and PR interval were small and similar across treatment 
groups.  
Mean changes from baseline in QTcF values were small and similar across treatment groups. The 
percentage of abnormal QTcF interval absolute values and changes were similar across the treatments 
groups.

In the subgroup of patients with Holter assessment in PT003007 study, changes from baseline in 24-hour 
mean, maximum, minimum, day-time, and night-time heart rate to week 4 were similar across the 
treatment groups and small compared with placebo. The magnitudes of the median differences between 
treatment groups in the frequency of isolated ventricular and supraventricular ectopic events were also 
small and not clinically relevant.  
Study PT003009 investigated the cardiovascular safety (Including QT/QTc Intervals) of two dose levels 
(One Therapeutic and One Supra-therapeutic) of Glycopyrrolate and Formoterol Fumarate Metered Dose 
Inhaler (GFF MDI) and a Supra-therapeutic Dose of Glycopyrrolate Metered Dose Inhaler (GP MDI) in 
Healthy Adult Volunteers, Compared with Moxifloxacin (400 mg Open-label) as the Positive Control.  
The following features of the trial design were noted: 
• 
In the primary endpoint (change-from-baseline) the individual correction QTcI was used.  Fridericia’s 
correction was used as the secondary endpoint.  
•  Continuous ECG recording (Holter) was used for QT and RR measurements in order to calculate the 
study endpoints. Additional twelve-lead safety ECGs were recorded to monitor subject’s safety. 
The study was designed, conducted and analysed in accordance with the ICH E14 guideline regarding 
thorough QT studies.  
The  supra-therapeutic  dose  of  GFF  caused  a  small  individual  corrected  QT  prolongation  although  the 
upper bound of the 90% CI was below 10 msec. As no QT prolongation was observed in subjects receiving 
supra-therapeutic dose GP MDI a small QT prolongation observed in the combination product could be 
linked to formoterol.  
Using Fridericia’s correction, the largest estimated mean difference from placebo for supra-therapeutic 
GFF  MDI  was  8.6  msec  (upper  bound  of  90%  CI  10.9  msec),  which  was  observed  at  10  minutes 
postdosing. 
There  were  no  subjects  with  either  a  >480  msec  or  >500  msec  outlier  value.  1  (2%)  subject  after 
treatment with therapeutic dose GFF MDI, 3 (5%) subjects after supra-therapeutic dose GFF MDI, 1 (2%) 
subject after supra-therapeutic dose GP, had one or more >450 msec QTcI outlier. 
It is known that that formoterol may induce prolongation of the QTc-interval. Warnings highlighting the 
cardiovascular risk and the risk of QT prolongation are included in the proposed SmPC in section 4.4 4.5 
and 5.1. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses were performed on the integrated Phase III Pivotal Studies (Studies PT003006 and 
PT003007) for relevant intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  
AE were evaluated in demographic subgroups (age, sex, and race) by baselines characteristics (COPD 
severity, diabetic status and extrinsic factors i.e. smoking, use of ICS, BB and diuretic). 
Effect of age:  The incidences of TEAEs in GFF MDI were reported at lower incidences in age group<65 
(57%) and ≥75 (58.3%). in comparison with 65-74 years (63.5%). The incidence of serious AEs in 
subjects of ≥75 was higher (11.1%) in comparison to the other age groups: <65 (6.8%), 65-74 years 
(8.5%). In order to allow appropriate evaluation of the available data and inclusion of relevant 
information about geriatric patients in the EPAR, SmPC and PIL the table as indicated in the clinical AR, 
section 4.8 should be filled by the Applicant. In the response to the D120 LoQ the applicant presented the 
data from safety population including  PT0030006, PT003007 and PT003014 with 1588 subjects treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 87/102 
 
 
 
 
 
with GFF MDI, of which 837 (52.7%) were <65 years, 630 (39.7%) were between 65 and 74 years, and 
121 (7.6%) were between 75 and 84 years (studies had an age cut-off).The incidence of TEAEs is 
reported at similar incidences between the treatments groups in all three age groups with slight increase 
of TEAEs in advanced age groups: GFF MDI 56.9%, FF MDI 52.9%, GP MDI 53.1% and placebo 53.7% in 
age group <65 ; GFF MDI 59.8%, FF MDI 57.8%, GP MDI 55.6% and placebo 59.4% in age group 65-74 
GFF MDI 57.9%, FF MDI 63.3%, GP MDI 63.1% and placebo 65.1% in age group 75-84. Therefore no 
dose adjustments are required in the elderly patients. 
Effect of gender: In line with the experience with other drugs, female patients tend to report adverse 
events more frequently than male patients. No notable differences were identified across the gender 
subgroups in the incidences of TEAEs that were not previously identified as most common in the overall 
population. 
Effect of race: TEAEs were reported at a similar incidence in Black or African American subjects compared 
with White subjects in the GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg (67.1% vs 59.0%), FF MDI 9.6 μg (50.7% vs 57.4%), GP 
MDI 14.4 μg (58.5% vs 56.3%), and Spiriva 18 μg (54.1% vs 62.7%) groups and at a lower incidence in 
the Placebo MDI group (48.7% vs 58.9%). It should be noted that there were disproportionally fewer 
Black or African American subjects (7.9% of all subjects) compared with White subjects (90.8% of all 
subjects). It is noted that over 90% of subjects in the safety database were Caucasian. The applicant is 
asked to comment on the likelihood of any potential clinical implications for other ethnic groups arising 
from this overrepresentation. In addition the applicant is asked to comment whether there is any 
additional data from the ongoing clinical studies which might be relevant to the discussion of AE by race. 
To answer this question the applicant provided safety data from pooled studies PT003006, PT003007, and 
PT003014 with  711 Asian subjects (14.2%), of whom 230 were exposed to GFF MDI, and 307 Black 
subjects (6.1%), of whom 94 were exposed to GFF MDI. In general, no specific differences in safety 
profile across different populations was noted, however, in Black patients higher incidences of AEs were 
reported for Gastrointestinal Disorders (19.1% versus 9.7%) and Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal 
Disorders (20.2% versus 14.2%). It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the limited data available in 
relation the population subgroups as the numbers involved are relatively small. The applicant is requested 
to continue to monitor this topic closely in future and to provide further updates/and/or update the 
product information should differences in safety profiles across different ethnic groups be identified. 
None of the subgroups analyses highlighted relevant differences in the safety profile compared with the 
overall population. 
Effect of smoking: TEAEs were reported at similar incidences in subjects who were current smokers 
compared with subjects who were former smokers across all treatment groups (GFF MDI 14.4/9.6 μg: 
56.8% vs 62.2%; FF MDI 9.6 μg: 55.2% vs 58.9%; GP MDI 14.4 μg: 55.0% vs 57.5%: Placebo MDI: 
54.9% vs 60.7%; and Spiriva 18 μg: 63.0% vs 62.4%). 
Immunological events 
The adverse event ‘hypersensitivity’ is included in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC in line with the 
established safety profile of both active substances in GFF MDI. 
It is noted that in 2014, the PRAC made recommendations in relation to the need to update the product 
information regarding the occurrence of hypersensitivity and angioedema with the use of glycopyrronium 
in the treatment of COPD. The applicant was asked to comment on whether strengthening of the proposed 
product information is required to reflect this and the existing data on 
hypersensitivity/angioedema. http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scie
ntific_Conclusion/human/002691/WC500207001.pdf  .  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 88/102 
 
 
 
 
 
The cases of hypersensitivity from the Phase III studies and from post-marketing/noninterventional study 
until 12 October 2017 were reviewed. No new safety signals arise. Regarding angioedema, the applicant 
is asked to continue to monitor for cases relating to this potential AE and to commit to updating the 
product information if necessary going forward. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There are no new signals from these data to suggest an adverse safety profile when glycopyrronium/ 
formoterol fumarate is used concomitantly with other medications commonly used by patients with COPD. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The overall discontinuation rate is unremarkable between the treatment groups. The incidences of TEAEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were generally low and similar across all groups 
(Bevespi Aerosphere: 6.2%, FF MDI: 5.3%, GP MDI: 6.2%, placebo: 7.4%, Spiriva: 4.9%). 
The most common AE leading to discontinuation were COPD with similar incidence in GFF and placebo 
(1.7% vs 1.8%) and dyspnoea with lower incidence in GFF MDI vs placebo (0.3% vs 1.6%). There was a 
higher rate of discontinuation due to pneumonia in GFF MDI compared to the placebo (0.6% vs 0.2%), 
nevertheless the incidence was low. 
In the integrated Long-term studies analysis, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was similar 
across the treating groups (GFF MDI 7.8%, FF MDI 6.0%, GP MDI 7.2%, Spiriva: 6.2%). The overall 
incidence of discontinuation in the GFF MDI group was higher than in the Spiriva group (6.2% for GFF MDI 
versus 4.9% for Spiriva in 24 week pooled data) and (7.8% for GFF MDI versus 6.2% for Spiriva in long 
term extension). The differences in exposure across these 2 treatment groups may have a role to play in 
these differences of 1.3% and 1.6%. The GFF MDI treatment group had 2.25 times as much treatment 
exposure in the 24-week studies and 1.95 times as much in the long-term safety extension compared to 
the Spiriva treatment group. 
The most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation was COPD, which was reported at higher 
incidences in the GFF MDI (2.3%) and GP MDI (2.7%) groups compared with the FF MDI (1.3%) and 
Spiriva (1.8%). Pneumonia AE leading to discontinuation occurred at higher incidences in GFF MDI and GP 
MDI (0.9% for each) compared with the FF MDI and Spiriva (0.2% for each), nevertheless the incidence 
was low. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
This FDC consists of the two mono-components, glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate, the safety 
profile of which has been previously well-characterised and is well known. The concern in assessing the 
safety profile of the FDC Formoterol fumarate/Glycopyrronium is, whether or not an additive effect is seen 
when the two actives are administered together in the same inhaler. 
The clinical development program included 4358 subjects with COPD, which have been exposed to one or 
more doses of GFF MDI / GP MDI / FF MDI. Three pivotal studies were regarded for GFF MDI FDC; the two 
24-week studies PT003006 and PT003007 with 2816 subjects and one 28-week extension study 
PT003008 with 722 subjects. A total of 1036 subjects were treated with the fixed dose combination GFF 
MDI for up to 24 weeks and a subset of 290 subjects were treated with GFF MDI for up to 52 weeks and 
provided long-term safety data. Thus a significant number of patients have been exposed to the GFF in an 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018

acceptable timeframe of 24-52 weeks. The exposure is in line with recommendations of the ICH 
guidelines (E1) and the safety database is considered to be adequate. 
The approach for the integrated analyses is supported. 
In Study PT003006 and PT003007, the mean age of subjects was 62.9 years with the majority of subjects 
in the <65 years age group (54.7%). The majority of subjects were male (55.8%), White (90.8%), and 
non-Hispanic (96.8%). Most subjects were enrolled at sites in the US (96.0%). The mean body mass 
index across all subjects was 28.2 kg/m2. The majority of subjects did not use inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) at baseline (63.4%) and were current smokers (53.7%). The mean number of pack years smoked 
across all subjects was 51.3 years. Demographic and other baseline data were similar across treatment 
groups.

Within the 12 months prior to enrolment into Studies PT003006 or PT003007, a total of 23.8% of subjects 
were treated for a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation, and 5.3% of subjects were admitted to a 
hospital or received emergency room treatment for a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation prior to 
study entry which is broadly representative of the target COPD population. 
In 24 weeks analysis, similar proportion of patients had treatment emergent adverse events between the 
treatment groups. Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
nasopharyngitis, cough, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection; the incidences of 
these events in the GFF MDI, FF MDI, and GP MDI groups were generally similar to or lower than the 
incidences in the Placebo and Spiriva groups. Cough, dry mouth, headache, muscle spasm, anxiety and 
tremor occurred at higher incidences in GFF compared with placebo.  
In 52 weeks analysis, the incidences of the TEAEs were generally similar between groups In the GFF 
group, the most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis, cough, upper respiratory tract 
infection, urinary tract infection, COPD and sinusitis.  
SAE 
In 24 weeks analysis, the SAEs were reported at similar incidences between groups. The most frequently 
reported SAEs and the only ones that occurred in ≥1% of subjects were COPD and pneumonia, however 
the incidence between GFF and placebo was similar. There is an imbalance in occurrence of pneumonia 
between treatment groups, with higher incidences in GFF MDI (1.0%) and GP MDI (1.2%) compared with 
the FF MDI (0.4%) and Spiriva (0.2%) groups.  
There are seen 4 cases of respiratory failure, two of them acute, in GFF MDI group versus 0 in placebo and 
applicant is requested to comment on these differences. 
In 52 weeks analysis, similarly to 24 weeks, the most frequently reported SAEs were COPD and 
pneumonia, reported in higher incidence in GFF MDI and GP MDI vs FF MDI and Spiriva.  
Death 
A total of 14 treatment-emergent deaths were reported in the Phase III Pivotal Studies.  
In 24 weeks analysis five patients died in the GFF MDI group of which 3 has cardiovascular origin. One 
patient died in FF MDI for peripheral artery thrombosis, one patient in GP MDI for aspiration pneumonia 
and one in placebo with unknown circumstances. Four patients died in Spiriva group, 1 for sudden cardiac 
death and 3 for other causes of overdose/suicide/self-injury. Two additional deaths occurred during the 
28-week treatment period; one in the FF MDI and one in Spiriva groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 90/102 
 
 
 
 
 
Two additional deaths were reported from Phase IIb Chronic dosing studies, one sudden death in subject 
with FF MDI and cardiac arrest in subject with GFF MDI treatment.  
The number of fatal cases reported from the ongoing clinical studies is 33. In the D120 LoQ the applicant 
was asked to present a cumulative overview and detailed causality assessment of the fatal cases reported 
to date with GFF MDI. The overall incidence of mortality observed with GFF MDI in the Phase III Study 
including PT003006, PT003007 and PT003014 was 0.4%. The number of death is small and in line with 
what would be expected in patients with advanced COPD with multiple underlying co-morbidities. The 
applicant presented a detailed overview of fatal cases, many of which relate to the occurrence of serious 
cardiovascular events. However it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on causality from the data 
presented due to the presence of confounding factors in many cases or limited data. Many patients had 
either co-morbid medical problems including cardiovascular disease or had background risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. The use of GFF MDI did not appear to have an additive effect on cardiovascular 
risk. However, it is recommended that this topic is kept under close review, given that patients receiving 
GFF MDI in the future are likely to be older patients many of whom will have significant co-morbid medical 
problems and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This will be monitored in the post authorisation 
setting through regular pharmacovigilance. 
Adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events of special interest have been defined based on known effects of LAMAs and LABAs; these 
include cardiovascular effects, ocular disorders, urinary retention, gastrointestinal disorders, and 
anticholinergic effects for LAMAs and cardiovascular and tremor effects for LABAs. 
Cardiovascular safety was monitored via specific analysis of adverse events of special interest including 
cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and central nervous system 
haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions.  
The most frequently reported cardiovascular AE was peripheral oedema, with incidences below ≤1%. 
There was higher frequency of tachyarrhythmias in GFF MDI vs placebo, i.e. atrial fibrillation (7 vs 1), 
sinus tachycardia (3 vs 0), and ventricular extrasystoles (3 vs 0). In the 52-week treatment, the similar 
trend as in 24-weeks studies was observed. The SmPC advises caution with the use of GFF MDI in patients 
with severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias or severe heart 
failure.  
As would be expected with LABA medications, the incidence of tremor was higher in the GFF MDI and FF 
MDI. The incidence of urinary retention was reported with a slightly higher incidence in the anticholinergic 
treatment groupsand urinary retention was added in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  No gastrointestinal AEs 
were reported in GFF MDI. The incidence of ocular AEs was ≤1%, and glaucoma was the most frequently 
reported, at higher incidence in treatment groups vs placebo. 
Overall, the data shows that some events are as expected in higher event rates in the active treatment 
groups than in the placebo and are compatible with either anticholinergic or β2-agonist pharmacology 
effect. However the incidence across the active treatment groups was generally similar and there is no 
evidence of an additive effect on adverse events of the two actives being administered in one combination 
inhaler. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematological data did not reveal any clinically relevant mean changes from baseline to end of 
treatment for any parameter in any treatment group. For chemistry parameters, small and generally 
similar changes from baseline to end of treatment were observed across all groups in total bilirubin. For 
AST, ALT and GGT, slightly higher increases were observed in GFF MDI; FF MDI and Spiriva groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 91/102 
 
 
 
 
 
compared with the GP MDI and Placebo, these differences however, are not clinically meaningful. These 
findings are similar to those observed in the 52 weeks study population. No notable changes from 
baseline to end-of-treatment in glucose and in potassium were observed for any treatment groups either 
in Phase III Pivotal studies or over 52 weeks. 
ECG parameters 
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate, PR interval and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval 
were small and similar across treatment groups. The percentage of abnormal QTcF interval absolute 
values and changes were similar across treatments groups. 
In the subgroup of patients with Holter assessment in PT003007 study, changes from baseline in 24-hour 
mean, maximum, minimum, day-time, and night-time heart rate to week 4 were similar across the 
treatment groups and small compared with placebo. 
Safety in special population 
AE were evaluated in demographic subgroups (age, sex, and race) by baselines characteristics (COPD 
severity, diabetic status and extrinsic factors.  
The incidences of TEAEs in GFF MDI were reported at lower incidences in age group<65 (57%) and ≥75 
(58.3%). in comparison with 65-74 years (63.5%). The incidence of serious AEs in subjects of ≥75 was 
higher (11.1%) in comparison to the other age group: <65 (6.8%), 65-74 years 8.5%). 
There were no notable differences across the age subgroups in the incidences of TEAEs that were not 
previously identified as most common in the overall population but that occurred at a ≥2% incidence in 
any treatment group based on the age subgroup analysis.  
None of the subgroups analyses highlighted relevant differences in the safety profile compared with the 
overall population with adequate text in the SmPC Section 4.2 which states that “No dose adjustments are 
required in the elderly patients”.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
From the safety data presented, there are no particular safety signals that suggest an additive effect from 
the  FDC  GFF  MDI  compared  with  the  mono-components  GP  MDI  and  FF  MDI.  The  main  side  effects 
observed are associated with the known LABA and LAMA effects. Overall, the clinical safety sections of the 
agreed SmPC contain appropriate and relevant information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic obstructive lung disease is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible at a 
functional level. This airflow limitation is progressive in nature and associated with abnormal 
inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases. Over time, chronic inflammation causes 
structural changes, narrowing of the small airways, and decreases in lung elastic recoil, leading to lung 
constriction during expiration and may also contribute to airflow limitation and mucociliary dysfunction. 
COPD is characterised by cough, dyspnoea on exertion or even at rest, with a consequent reduction of 
physical activity and deterioration of quality of life.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Non-pharmacological treatment such as exercise and smoking cessation are cornerstones of COPD 
treatment. Pharmacologic therapy for COPD is used to reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and 
severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Several classes of 
medications are commonly usedin treatment of COPD with long acting bronchodilators (long-acting beta2 
receptor agonists [LABA] and/or long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist [LAMA]) being key elements 
of pharmacologic treatment of COPD. In patients not adequately controlled on a LAMA or LABA as 
monotherapy a combination of the two could be indicated thereby combining two long acting 
bronchodilators with different mode of action. 
Other LAMA/LABA fixed combinations are available on the market. The approved indication for the 
products approved via the centralized procedure is:  
Maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Both active components of Bevespi (glycopyrronium and formoterol) are available as monotherapy 
products and combined with other substances from the two classes. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program for Bevespi Aerosphere included three 24 week, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pivotal Phase III studies in 5,474 subjects with moderate 
to very severe COPD. These 3 studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of Bevespi Aerosphere, 
glycopyrronium (GP) MDI, formoterol (FF) MDI, and placebo MDI administered twice daily. In addition, 
data from a 28-week III extension study is available. The majority of subjects were current smokers with 
moderate to very severe COPD (FEV 30-80 % of predicted) and a mean total CAT score of 15-19. The 
main objectives of the studies are investigated by means of two co-primary endpoints (or primary and key 
secondary in study PT003014) i.e. change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 and TDI focal 
score, both recoded over 24 weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
There was a change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 of 130-160 ml for the fixed 
combination above placebo with similar contribution from each of the two components (for the respective 
studies the 95 CI were 132-183, 103-155 and 129-180 ml). This effect on lung function was supported by 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 94/102 
 
 
 
 
 
data on secondary endpoints such as need for rescue medication and it was most prominent in patient 
with high level of reversibility of their airflow. 
The change of the SAC-TDI/TDI focal score was 0.3 - 0.8 (95 % CI 0.21-0.72, 0.11-0.56 and 0.47-1-13 
respectively) in the 3 pivotal studies and this effect level was consistent with results recorded for 
secondary parameters measuring symptoms and quality of life e.g SGRQ which was - 2.39 (95 % CI -4.07 
— -0.71) -1.66 (-3.34 – 0.02),  and – 3.50 (-5.18 - -1.82) respectively in the three pivotal studies. 
In the pivotal studies, the magnitude of benefit of Bevespi Aerosphere on SGRQ compared to placebo, 
glycopyrronium and formoterol increased with increasing levels of baseline symptoms as measured by 
CAT. In the group with the highest CAT Score (>20) the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at 
week 24 was -4.03. In one of the pivotal studies, in a symptomatic population (CAT Score≥15), the 
proportion of patients who responded with a clinically relevant difference in SGRQ (defined as a 
decrease of 4 units from baseline) at Week 24 was 49% for Bevespi compared to  29% for placebo. 
The applicant has presented a clinical study aiming to show similarity between administration with and 
without the spacer device Aerochamber Plus VHC. The data does not indicate any clinically meaningful 
differences when the product is used with and without spacer. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The effect on dyspnoea (as measured by SAC-TDI and SGRQ) of Bevespi compared to placebo was 
modest in 2 of the pivotal studies. Sensitivity analyses indicated a somewhat higher effect level in the 
most severely affected patients but overall the level of effect was lower than what has been recorded for 
similar products previously approved.  
Another uncertainty is the effect of the GP component included in Bevespi Aerosphere. While its 
contribution to the effect on lung function is undisputable, the contribution to the effect on symptoms was 
very modest in 2 of the 3 pivotal studies. In addition, in study PT003006 tiotropium was included as a 
control and appeared to perform somewhat better that the GP MDI. The difference in FEV1 [95% CI] was 
-31 ml [-52; -10] and in SAC-TDI focal score -0.19 [-0.40, 0.01]. However treatment comparison for GP 
MDI in Bevespi versus placebo (study PT003014) compared to GP published studies provides some 
assurance that it is comparable to other authorised products although it is viewed with caution as it is a 
cross study comparison which was conducted post hoc. 
Two of the pivotal studies (the ones with a more modest effect on symptoms) were conducted mainly in 
the US and there were no EU centres involved in these studies. The baseline medication appears not to be 
given in accordance with EU treatment guidelines as few patients were under treatment with long acting 
bronchodilators at screening. Instead they had high level of uses of reliever therapy which complicated 
the assessment of effect on symptoms.  Further, a different instrument was used to record symptoms in 
these studies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidences of the treatment emergent adverse events were generally similar between the treatment 
groups (GFF (59.6%), FF (56.9%), GP (56.2%), placebo (57.6%), and Spiriva (62.7%). Most AEs were 
mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs by Preferred Term were 
nasopharyngitis, cough, upper respiratory tract infection and; urinary tract infection; the incidence of 
these events in the GFF MDI, FF MDI, and GP MDI groups were generally similar to or lower than the 
incidences in the placebo and Spiriva groups. The most commonly reported AEs, which occurred at higher 
incidences in GFF MDI compared with Placebo, were cough (4.0% vs 2.7%), dry mouth (1.3% vs 0.2%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/778350/2018  
Page 95/102 
 
 
 
 
 
headache (1.4% vs 0.9%), muscle spasm (1.5% vs 0.9%), anxiety (1.3% vs 0%) and tremor (0.8% vs 
0%), although the differences in incidence were small. 
The most frequently reported SAEs and the only ones that occurred in ≥1% of subjects were COPD and 
pneumonia. 
Although the incidence of the cardiac arrhythmia SMQ was similar across treatment groups (GFF 2.0%, FF 
2.0%, GP 1.8%, Placebo 1.6%, Spiriva 0.7%), small differences in the number were observed for GFF 
compared with placebo, i.e. atrial fibrillation (7 vs 1), sinus tachycardia (3 vs 0), and ventricular 
extrasystoles (3 vs 0). Tremor was reported in <1% of subjects in all treatment groups. The incidence of 
urinary retention was low across treatment groups (GFF 0.3%, FF 0.2%, GP 0.1%, placebo 0%, Spiriva 
0.7%).  
From the safety data presented, there is no evidence of an additive effect on adverse events of the two 
actives being administered in one combination inhaler. The overall safety profile of FF/GP was generally 
consistent with the pharmacologic class of each mono-component and no new safety signal up to 24 
weeks and in the extension up to 52 weeks was seen.  
Mean changes from baseline in the heart rate, PR interval and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval 
were small and similar across treatment groups. The percentage of abnormal QTcF interval absolute 
values and changes were also similar across treatments groups (GFF (0.4%), FF (0.4%), GP (1.6%) and 
placebo (0.9%). 
None of the subgroups analyses (by age, gender, race, COPD severity, diabetic status and extrinsic 
factors) detected relevant differences in the safety profile compared with the overall population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is limited data on long term safety as only a smaller subset of patients was treated for 52 weeks. 
Cardiovascular safety remains an area of special focus and this topic should remain under ongoing 
monitoring.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Both LABAs and LAMAs are well established treatments of COPD, as moncomponents or in combination. 
Overall, the submitted documentation shows that the effect of Bevespi on lung function is of clinical 
relevance and that both components contribute to this effect. Even though bronchodilation is the 
cornerstone of medical COPD treatment, it is known that lung function as measured by spirometry does 
not always correlate with effects on symptoms and quality of life. According to the guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of COPD (EMA/CHMP/483572/2012), efficacy should 
be shown not only with regard to lung function but also for symptoms or quality of life. Bevespi shows an 
effect also on these parameters, but in 2 of the studies, this effect is somewhat less pronounced compared 
to what has previously have been considered as a relevant effect. However, in the third study, the effect 
is in line with what has been documented for other similar products. 
During the assessment procedure, it has been considered whether the lower than expected effect on 
symptoms could be due to a suboptimal effect of the GP component. However, even if the effect on lung 
functions associated with this component seems to be lower compared to tiotropium in a direct 
comparison, the effect on the same parameter when compared to placebo in the pivotal studies is of 
clinical relevance. Thus, the GP component is considered to contribute to the effect of Bevespi in an 
adequate way.    
The safety profile is as expected and consistent with the available knowledge concerning the included 
components.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Bevespi consists of two well known substances with well documented efficacy in the treatment of patients 
with COPD. In the pivotal studies, this effect was confirmed as reflected by clinically relevant 
improvements of lung function, which is considered the most sensitive way to document an effect of a 
bronchodilator treatment. Both components are contributing to this effect. With respect to effect on 
symptoms, a relevant effect on symptoms was shown in one of the pivotal studies.  It can be questioned 
if the effect on symptoms in the 2 other pivotal studies were of clinical relevance, but considering the well 
known mechanism of action of the components included in Bevespi and the undisputable effect on lung 
function,  a beneficial effect for patients is expected and this benefit is considered to outweigh the well 
characterized risks.  
The applied indication is “Bevespi Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to 
relieve symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)”. Even though the 
wording “to relieve symptoms” could be questioned since the main effect has been shown on 
improvement of lung function, deleting this wording would imply a broader effect compared to other 
LAMA/LABA products (who are approved with the indication above). This would be misleading considering 
the modest effect on symptoms in two of the studies. Therefore, the proposed indication is acceptable by 
the majority of CHMP. Further information is detailed in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on  benefits and risks 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk of Bevespi Aerosphere is positive.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 18 October 2018 
Bevespi Aerosphere EMEA/H/C/004245/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Bevespi  Aerosphere  (glycopyrronium  and  formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate) indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment in adult patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
Although improving lung function is a key goal of COPD pharmacotherapy, FEV1 measurements alone do 
not sufficiently reflect the clinical relevance for patients. Therefore, in case lung function is selected as a 
primary endpoint, the relevant EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (EMA/CHMP/483572/2012) requests 
additional evidence of efficacy through the use of a co-primary endpoint, which should either be a 
symptom-based or a patient-related endpoint. 
For the fixed dose combination (FDC) product Bevespi Aerosphere, the co-primary endpoint “change from 
baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1” did show a significant and clinically relevant improvement of 
the FDC compared to placebo, but the other co-primary endpoint “transitional dyspnoea index” (TDI), 
failed to consistently achieve statistical significance. In addition, no consistent clinically relevant 
improvements could be demonstrated for relieve of symptoms and quality of life (measured by St. 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)). Compared to placebo, the FDC did not reach the margin of 
Minimum Clinically Important Difference for TDI or SGRQ in any of the three submitted studies. In 
addition, the data on moderate/severe exacerbations are very limited and of too short duration (24 
weeks), providing inconclusive results. 
Furthermore, the contribution, in particular of the LAMA component, to the observed effect of the FDC in 
terms of TDI or SGQR, was small and not considered meaningful.  
Finally, the failure of the FDC to show superiority to Spiriva, an approved LAMA monotherapy, adds to the 
uncertainty regarding adequate efficacy of Bevespi Aerosphere as in clinical practice a step-up in therapy 
is recommended in patients insufficiently responding to a LAMA alone (GOLD 2018). 
In conclusion, the evidence for therapeutic efficacy of Bevespi Aerosphere is regarded as insufficient and 
therefore the B/R balance of Bevespi Aerosphere is considered negative.

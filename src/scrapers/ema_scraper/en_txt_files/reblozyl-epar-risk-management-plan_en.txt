Brief description of product 
including chemical class, 
summary of mode of action, 
important information about 
its composition (eg, origin of 
active substance of 
biologicals, relevant 
adjuvants or residual 
vaccines) 
Luspatercept (BMS-986346, ACE-536), an erythroid maturation agent, is a 
recombinant fusion protein that binds selected transforming growth factor-β 
superfamily ligands and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. By 
binding to specific endogenous ligands (eg, growth differentiation factor 11, 
activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signalling, resulting in erythroid 
maturation through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors 
(normoblasts) in the bone marrow. Smad2/3 signalling is abnormally high in 
disease models characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis (ie, MDS and 
β-thalassaemia) and in the bone marrow of MDS patients.

The incidence, prevalence, mortality, and demographics of the population of patients with MDS 
and β-thalassaemia are summarised in Table 2.1.2.1-1 and Table 2.1.2.1-2, respectively.

An analysis of 64 cancer registries from European countries indicates that the incidence of 
MDS was 1.5 per 100,000 individuals per year from 1995 to 2002 (Visser, 2012).1
Data from the Düsseldorf registry in Germany suggest that the overall crude incidence rate 
was 3.78 per 100,000 person-years for MDS as defined by World Health Organization 
(WHO) subtypes and 4.88 per 100,000 person-years using French American British 
classification) (Neukirchen, 2011).2
In the United States (US), estimates of age-adjusted incidence per 100,000 individuals from 
the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) were 
reported as 3.3 per year during 2001 to 2003 and 4.9 per year during 2007 to 2011 
(Cogle, 2015).3
Incidence of MDS extracted from population-based registries such as SEER in the US and 
similar databases worldwide may not accurately capture the true number of MDS cases due 
to underdiagnoses and underreporting (Cogle, 2011).4
An analysis of 22 European cancer registries indicated that the prevalence of MDS was 
approximately 25,000 cases in 2008 (Visser, 2012).1
The accuracy of the estimates for the number of people living with MDS is difficult to 
gauge. MDS prevalence is rarely reported to registries and underestimation is suspected 
(Cogle, 2015).3 Between 60,000 and 170,000 individuals in the US are estimated to have 
MDS and this number is projected to grow as the life expectancy of patients with MDS 
increases (Cogle, 2015).3
The global prevalence of MDS was reported within a range of 0.022 to 1.32 per 10,000 for 
all age categories, genders, and ethnicities (Lubeck, 2016).5
Approximately 30% of all MDS patients have > 15% of bone marrow erythroid precursors 
consisting of ring sideroblasts (Papaemmanuil, 2013).6

In the Multicentre Registry study, the median time of survival from diagnosis was 
75 months (range, 1.7 to 350 months). The 2- and 5-year survival probabilities were 86% 
and 61%, respectively. Transfusion-dependent patients had a median survival of 44 months 
compared to 97 months for transfusion-independent patients (Germing, 2012).7
Among MDS patients reported to the SEER (17 regions) during 2001 to 2008, the 3-year 
observed survival has been reported to be 42% and the 5-year survival rate is 29% 
(Ma, 2012).8 Previous studies have shown that age, sex, transfusion dependence, MDS 
subtype, bone marrow blast percentage, number of cytopenias, and cytogenetics are 
prognostic factors (Ma, 20128; Bennett, 20029; Greenberg, 199710). Younger patients have 
demonstrated better survival, and men with MDS are 25% more likely to die than women 
(Ma, 2007).11
Progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) occurs at a variable rate depending on the 
presence of adverse prognostic risk factors. In the Multicentre Registry study, the 
cumulative AML progression risk was 4.7% after 2 years of diagnosis and 14.7% after 
5 years. In the first 2 years following diagnosis, the probability of developing AML was 
11% for patients presenting with transfusion dependency compared with 2% among patients 
without transfusion dependency (Germing, 2012).7
In adult patients without inherited predisposition, MDS may be attributed to a number of 
factors, including older age, prior treatment with chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy, and 
exposure to environmental irritants (Ades, 201412; Fenaux, 201413; Foran, 201214). 
Advancing age is the single greatest risk factor (Sekeres, 2010).15
The overall age-standardised incidence rate was 4.30 and 3.32 per 100,000 person-years for 
men and women, respectively, in the Düsseldorf MDS Registry. The incidence rate ratio 
comparing men to women was 1.78 (Neukirchen, 2011).2
Using data from the Düsseldorf MDS Registry, in 2003 the median age of prevalent male 
and female patients was 69 and 78 years, respectively (Neukirchen, 2011).2
In an analysis of data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, 
age adjusted incidence of MDS was significantly higher among males and a sharp increase 
was observed with age; rates were 5 times greater among those aged 80 years and older 
(35.5 per 100,000) compared with those aged 60 to 69 years (7.1 per 100,000) 
(Rollison, 2008).16
Transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk MDS have limited treatment options that 
overcome the burdens and risks associated with chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. 
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used as first-line treatment option for anaemia 
in lower-risk MDS patients without del(5q) (Fenaux, 201413; NCCN, 201917).
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®, BMS) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with TD anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with an 
isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient 
or inadequate (Revlimid SmPC, 2019).18
The major favourable prognostic factors for response to ESAs are low or no RBC 
transfusion requirement (< 2 units/month) and a baseline serum erythropoietin (EPO) level 
< 500 U/L (Fenaux, 2014).13 The European ESA scoring system uses a serum EPO level of 
≤ 200 U/L as a prognostic factor for ESA responsiveness (Santini, 2013).19 Eprex® is the 
only approved ESA, and is approved via Mutual Recognition Procedure in a number of EU

intermediate-1-risk primary MDS who have low serum EPO (< 200 U/L) 
(Eprex SmPC, 2017).20
Approximately 70% of patients will eventually become unresponsive to ESAs 
(Park, 2017).21 The second-line treatment options are restricted to aggressive 
disease-modifying agents, which include anti-lymphocyte globulin and anti-thymocyte 
globulin (immunosuppressive therapies), azacitidine and decitabine (hypomethylating 
agents) and lenalidomide. Outcomes remain suboptimal despite the use of these second-line 
treatment options, and many patients will ultimately require long-term RBC transfusions 
(Fenaux, 201413; NCCN, 201917). 
RBC transfusions remain the mainstay of treatment in patients with lower-risk MDS and 
anaemia but are associated with risk (Platzbecker, 201222; Fenaux, 201323; 
Hellström-Lindberg, 201324). Red blood cell-transfusion dependence and lower 
haemoglobin levels have been associated with a deleterious impact on outcomes and 
increased mortality in patients with MDS (Platzbecker, 201222; Fenaux, 201323;
Hellström-Lindberg, 201324). In addition, long-term RBC transfusion dependence has other 
clinical consequences (Platzbecker, 2012).22 These include a potentially negative impact on 
quality of life, the development of iron overload and its associated complications, and the 
development of immune-related disorders and increased risk of infection (Fenaux, 200925; 
Vamvakas, 200926; Platzbecker, 201222). 
There is a need for additional therapies to treat the MDS-associated anaemia in patients with 
lower-risk MDS, whose disease does not yet need treatment with more intensive and less

The annual incidence at birth of symptomatic -thalassaemia is estimated at 1 in 
100,000 worldwide, and 1 in 10,000 in the EU (Galanello, 2010).32
Incidence is highest in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and South East Asia 
(particularly India, Thailand, and Indonesia; this region accounts for approximately 50% of 
affected births) and incidence is increasing worldwide (eg, Europe, the Americas and 
Australia) as a result of migration (Colah, 201033; Modell, 2008a34).
It is estimated that about 80 to 90 million people (~1.5% of the global population) are 
carriers of -thalassaemia with approximately 60,000 symptomatic individuals born 
annually (Galanello, 2010).32
Some 23,000 children are born with TD β-thalassaemia each year, while a smaller, 
ill-defined number have non-TD forms. Non-TD is most commonly found in parts of the 
Eastern Mediterranean and Africa, where β+ thalassaemia predominates (Modell, 2008a34; 
Musallam, 201335; Taher, 2013a36; Weatherall, 201037).
The highest prevalence of the structural variant haemoglobin E is observed in the Indian 
subcontinent and East and Southeast Asia, where carrier frequencies may reach as high as 
80% (Olivieri, 201038; Weatherall, 200539; Weatherall, 201037).
Haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia currently affects around 1,000,000 people worldwide 
(Olivieri, 2011)40 and more than 19,000 affected children are born each year, with half 
having TD and the other half non-TD (Modell, 2008a34; Weatherall, 201037).
β-thalassaemia comprises a number of different phenotypes with varying severity, including: 

TD: includes patients with β-thalassaemia major or severe forms of β-thalassaemia 
intermedia or haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia, which require regular RBC transfusions.


non-TD: includes patients with mild-to-moderate β-thalassaemia intermedia or 
haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia who may require infrequent transfusions to manage the 
disease and its complications.
β-thalassaemia trait (minor): heterozygous patients with mild, usually asymptomatic 
anaemia that generally does not require treatment (excluded from the luspatercept target 
patient population).
β-thalassaemia major usually presents between 6 and 24 months of age when the normal 
switch from γ-chains to β-chains does not occur. These individuals are TD, and if left 
untreated, will die by the age of 5 years from infections and cachexia (Galanello, 2010).32
Individuals with thalassaemia intermedia present between the ages of 2 and 6 years old 
(Galanello, 2010).32
Individuals with thalassaemia minor usually have excellent prognosis (Galanello, 2010).32

Table 2.1.2.1-2:
Epidemiology of Patients with β-thalassaemia
In some resource-limited settings, the clinical picture in patients who are untreated or poorly 
transfused, is characterised by growth retardation, pallor, jaundice, poor musculature, genu 
valgum, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, development of masses from EMH, and skeletal 
changes resulting from expansion of the bone marrow (Galanello, 2010).32 Many children 
who are adequately transfused and are fully compliant with iron chelation therapy develop 
normally up to 10 to 12 years. TD patients may suffer from the side effects of chronic 
transfusions, namely transfusion-associated infections, (particularly hepatitis B and C and in 
some populations human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and organ damage due to iron 
overload (including liver, heart, and endocrine glands) (Galanello, 2010).32
The primary cause of death in adult TD patients remains cardiac events due to iron overload 
mainly caused by RBC transfusions (Borgna Pignatti, 200441; Cappellini, 2014a42) 
although recent studies show that liver disease is also becoming a leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality (Voskaridou, 2012).43
The average life expectancy of an individual with β-thalassaemia was 17 years in 1970, 
27 years in 1980, and 37 years in 1990. Since 2000, greater than 80% of patients have a life 
expectancy of > 40 years (Modell, 2008b).44
In non-TD β-thalassaemia patients, treatment strategy is focused in part on iron overload-
related complications, but also on several complications of the disease itself. If left 
untreated, the clinical sequelae of non-TD β-thalassaemia patients are due principally to the 
combined effect of ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic anaemia, and iron overload (Taher, 
2011).45 As a result of the ineffective RBC production by the bone marrow (ineffective 
erythropoiesis), a forced expansion of the haematopoietic tissue outside the marrow medulla 
appears and leads to haematopoietic compensatory involvement, mostly in the form of 
masses in other regions in the body; this phenomenon is termed EMH (Taher, 200646; 
Haidar, 201047). In addition to EMH, ineffective erythropoiesis is also associated with 
skeletal deformities, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and bone pain attributed to erythroid 
expansion in the bone marrow (Haidar, 2010).47 Ineffective erythropoiesis also leads to 
increased intestinal iron absorption, peripheral haemolysis, and a hypercoagulable state 
(Musallam, 2013).35 Additional complications that are thus commonly seen in non-TD β-
thalassaemia include liver disease, cholelithiasis, endocrinopathy, thrombosis, and 
pulmonary hypertension with right-sided heart failure, all of which have been associated 
with iron overload, hypercoagulability, or both. Despite frequently presenting with anaemia, 
patients with non-TD β-thalassaemia are by definition not dependent on regular transfusion 
for survival, a characteristic that distinguishes non-TD β-thalassaemia from TD 
β-thalassaemia.
Given the current lack of safe and effective drug therapies, there is significant unmet 
medical need for the development of new therapies that specifically address the underlying 
pathophysiology of both TD β-thalassaemia and non-TD β-thalassaemia including anaemia 
and complications of ineffective erythropoiesis.
Risk factors for 
the disease 
Family history is a strong risk factor for β-thalassaemia. Mutations in the β-globin gene can 
be passed on from each of the two carrier parents to affected offspring in a recessive 
Mendelian manner (Musallam, 2013).35

Epidemiology of Patients with β-thalassaemia
Demographic 
profile of target 
population
Main treatment 
options 
β-thalassaemia has no gender predilection and affects both sexes equally.
β-thalassaemia is prevalent in individuals of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian, 
Indian, Southern Chinese, Far Eastern, coastal North African and South American descent 
have the highest incidence of β-thalassaemia (Galanello, 2010).32
β-thalassaemia major usually manifests between the ages of 6 and 24 months. Individuals 
with thalassaemia intermedia present between the ages of 2 and 6 years old. Patients with 
thalassaemia minor may be asymptomatic and may not require treatment 
(Galanello, 2010).32
Current treatment options for β-thalassaemia are limited. 
Blood transfusions remain the main component of the β-thalassaemia standard of care, but 
the practice is attended by a significant number of risks, primarily driven by secondary iron 
overload and associated organ failure (heart, liver, and endocrine glands) 
(Cappellini, 2014a42; Musallam, 201335; Taher, 2013a36; Taher, 201848). Patients who 
receive regular blood transfusions are also at risk of a variety of other serious complications 
including development of alloantibodies, which may lead to decreased lifespan of transfused 
blood cells and results in difficulty in obtaining compatible blood for transfusion, as well as 
transfusion reactions including nonhaemolytic febrile transfusions reactions, allergic 
reactions, acute haemolytic reactions, delayed transfusion reactions, and autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia. Furthermore, though rare, these patients are likewise exposed to the 
serious risks of infectious agent transmission, transfusion-related acute lung injury, 
transfusion-induced graft versus host disease, and transfusion-associated circulatory collapse 
(Vamvakas, 2009).26 Although the survival of patients with non-TD β-thalassaemia is not 
dependent on regular transfusion, transfusion requirements may change over time. Early in 
disease, transfusions may be intermittently required due to events such as pregnancy, 
splenomegaly, or infections (Vichinsky, 2016).49 Patients with non-TD β-thalassaemia may 
be placed on regular transfusions to manage specific disease complications.
There is no available therapy that is widely used to address the underlying ineffective 
erythropoiesis and anaemia of β-thalassaemia.
The only approved therapies in Europe and the US for both TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia 
are iron chelating agents for the treatment of iron overload (Cappellini, 2014a42; Musallam, 
201335; Taher, 201848). Data support the efficacy of iron chelators in removing iron from 
the liver and heart of patients with TD β-thalassaemia; however, recent data indicate that 
optimal control of iron overload in the global population of TD β-thalassaemia has not yet 
been achieved (Aydinok, 2015).50 Iron chelators are also associated with several known side 
effects, which require close clinical and laboratory monitoring, adding to the burden of a 
chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy (Cappellini, 2014a42; Musallam, 201335; 
Taher, 201848). 
Splenectomy, as a transfusion sparing procedure, is also primarily restricted to patients with 
symptomatic splenomegaly or hypersplenism because of the concurrent high risk of 
infections and vascular disease, in particular thromboembolism, following the procedure 
(Cappellini, 2014a42; Natesirinilkul, 201651; Taher, 2013a36).

Epidemiology of Patients with β-thalassaemia
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only available curative therapy for patients 
with β-thalassaemia; however, several factors continue to limit its acceptability: an overall 
mortality risk of 12% within 2 years of transplantation, acute and chronic graft versus host 
disease and graft failure, and the need for complete myeloablation that can result in 
infertility and other toxicities (Baronciani, 201652; Cappellini, 2014a42; Taher, 2013a36). 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not appropriate in patients exhibiting severe iron 
overload, and in patients with liver pathologies such as severe hepatomegaly or fibrosis 
(Cappellini, 2014a).42
Zynteglo™ has recently been approved for a small subset of patients with TD β-thalassemia 
as a potential curative therapy: Betibeglogene autotemcel is approved for the treatment of 
patients 12 years and older with TD β-thalassaemia who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for 
whom haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is appropriate but a human leukocyte 
antigen-matched related haematopoietic stem cell donor is not available. 
Because β-thalassemia patients are at increased rate of thromboembolic complications, 
patients with certain risk factors such as splenectomy with elevated platelet counts or 
cardiac disorders should be considered for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy such as low-
dose aspirin (Taher, 2017).53

A summary of the nonclinical  findings and their relevance to human usage  is outlined  in Table 
2.2-1.

Nonclinical Risks and Relevance to Human Use
Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Usage
Toxicity Studies

Single and Repeat-dose Toxicity
Single-dose toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
luspatercept. Repeat-dose toxicology studies have been 
performed with luspatercept in rats and monkeys, dosing SC 
every 2 weeks for up to 3 (rats) or 6 (monkeys) months.
Increases in measures of RBC mass (RBC, haematocrit, and 
haemoglobin) were observed in both species. In addition, 
EMH was noted in the mandibular and axillary lymph nodes 
at all dose levels in the monkey 6-month study. This is a 
common background finding in cynomolgus monkeys of this 
age.
Decreased heart and lung weights with no associated 
histology findings, adrenal gland necrosis/congestion, liver 
necrosis, thymus congestion and mineralisation of the 
glandular portion of the stomach were observed in rats. A 
clinical observation of swollen hindlimbs/feet was noted in 
several studies in rats and rabbits (including juvenile and 
reproductive toxicity studies). In 1 juvenile rat, this correlated 
histopathologically with new bone formation, fibrosis, and 
inflammation.
Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the interstitium, 
including the blood vessels, of the choroid plexus was 
observed in monkeys. Immunohistochemistry of the choroid 
plexus revealed increased complement (C3) granularity in the 
interstitium. This finding was not considered diagnostic for, 
but was consistent with, increased handling of complement 
components, most likely as immune complexes by the foamy 
macrophages.
The above findings were generally reversible after a recovery 
period. 
 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
Embryo-foetal developmental toxicology studies were 
conducted in the pregnant Sprague Dawley rat and New 
Zealand White rabbit. Luspatercept was a selective 
developmental toxicant (dam not affected; foetus affected) in 
the rat and a maternal and foetal developmental toxicant (doe 
and foetus affected) in the rabbit. In both species, effects 
included increased resorptions and postimplantation loss, and 
decreased litter size. There was also an increased incidence of 
skeletal variations in both rats and rabbits. In both species, 
effects of luspatercept were observed at the lowest dose tested 
(5 mg/kg), which corresponds to an estimated exposure in rats 
Consistent with the expected pharmacologic 
action of luspatercept, a first-in-class erythroid 
maturation agent, it mitigates ineffective 
erythropoiesis, and is thereby indicated in the 
treatment of different chronic anaemias such as 
β-thalassaemia, MDS and myelofibrosis. 
Findings in rats were considered rodent-specific, 
as they were not observed in monkeys. 
Additionally, no evidence of similar toxicity, as 
assessed by routine monitoring, has been 
observed in humans in the BMS-sponsored 
clinical trials.
The microscopic changes in the choroid plexus 
in monkeys were not considered adverse, are 
similar to background changes known to occur 
in cynomolgus monkeys (Butt, 2015),61 would 
not be expected to interfere with choroid plexus 
function, and were not associated with any 
central nervous system clinical signs.
EMH masses have been observed during 
treatment with luspatercept in Study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002 and patients should be monitored 
for signs and symptoms of EMH masses, 
including any complications resulting from the 
EMH masses, and treated according to standard 
clinical guidelines.
Luspatercept is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential 
(WCBP) have to use effective contraception 
during treatment with luspatercept and for at 
least 3 months after the last dose. Prior to 
starting treatment with luspatercept, a pregnancy 
test has to be performed for WCBP. Treatment 
with luspatercept should not be started if the 
woman is pregnant. If a patient becomes 
pregnant, luspatercept should be discontinued.

and rabbits of approximately 2.7 and 5.5 times greater, 
respectively, than the estimated clinical exposure.
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, 
there were significant reductions in the average numbers of 
corpora lutea, implantations, and viable embryos in 
luspatercept-treated females. There was no effect on mating, 
fertility, or litter parameters when males treated with 
luspatercept were mated with untreated females. The maternal 
no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 3 mg/kg 
(estimated exposure multiple of 1.5 times higher than 
1.75 mg/kg clinical dose), and the paternal NOAEL was the 
highest dose tested, 15 mg/kg (estimated exposure multiple of 
7 times higher than 1.75 mg/kg clinical dose). Effects on 
fertility in female rats were reversible after a 14-week 
recovery period.
In a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study, 
decreased body weights and adverse kidney findings were 
observed in the first filial generation (F1) at all dose levels, 
but the NOAEL for effects on behavioural indices, fertility, or 
reproductive parameters was the highest dose tested, 
30 mg/kg (estimated exposure multiple of 15 times higher 
than 1.75 mg/kg clinical dose).
 Nephrotoxicity
Adverse findings in rats included membrano-proliferative 
glomerulonephritis. Adverse findings in monkeys included 
membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, interstitial 
tubular haemorrhage, tubular atrophy and degeneration, 
fibrosis/fibroplasias, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates 
in the kidney. The kidney findings were presumed to be a 
direct drug effect, although a contribution to the changes by 
immune complex deposition could not be excluded.
Variables associated with the kidney pathology were minimal 
increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Increases in 
potassium and inorganic phosphorous were also noted in 
females at 60 mg/kg in the 1-month rat study, as well as 
increases in urinary albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) ratio in 
individual monkeys in the 6-month study.
Relevance to Human Usage
The effect of luspatercept on fertility in humans 
is unknown. Based on findings in animals, 
luspatercept may compromise female fertility.
Lactation is discussed in the “Other 
Toxicity-related Information” row.
In the luspatercept clinical studies, renal injury 
was evaluated by assessing luspatercept with 
respect to its renal adverse event (AE) profile, 
its impact on renal function (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl]), and its impact on proteinuria. Among 
luspatercept-treated patients with events of renal 
impairment, renal function generally recovered 
substantially while the patient remained on 
luspatercept, indicating negative re-challenge. 
Episodes of impaired renal function were 
typically preceded by the occurrence of another 
AE typically linked with the development of 
acute renal failure (eg, sepsis, decompensated 
congestive heart failure), or was preceded by the 
use of therapeutic agents known to be 
potentially nephrotoxic. Finally, mean ACR 
remained clinically stable over time, with no 
prolonged elevations of mean ACR in patients in 
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. In summary, 
administration of luspatercept was not 
associated with prolonged or irreversible 
worsening of clinically important indicators of 
kidney injury over the course of treatment.

Relevance to Human Usage
In the luspatercept clinical studies, all of the 
elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
total bilirubin in these patients had alternative 
explanations, including pre-existing increased 
bilirubin, concurrent treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs), history of cirrhosis and/or hepatitis C, 
and use of concomitant medication capable of 
causing liver injury.
Not applicable.
In luspatercept clinical studies, patients who 
experienced progression to AML within the 
MDS population had relevant risk factors for 
developing AML based on their baseline disease 
characteristics, and no effect of luspatercept was 
observed in the randomised Phase 3 study 
(ACE-536-MDS-001). Although there was no 
imbalance in malignancies in the MDS clinical 
programme and no malignancies reported in 
luspatercept-treated patients in the TD 
β-thalassaemia population up until the data 
cut-offs in this RMP, long-term data are limited. 
No malignancies have been reported in 
luspatercept-treated non-transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassemia patients in Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002.
 Hepatotoxicity
Not applicable as no separate studies were performed to 
investigate hepatotoxicity. The repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
described above did however assess all organ systems.
 Genotoxicity
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with 
luspatercept, as is typical for biologics, in accordance with 
International Council for Harmonisation S6 guidance.
 Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with 
luspatercept, as these studies are not appropriate for 
biotechnology-derived therapeutics.
In the definitive toxicity study conducted in juvenile rats, 
haematologic malignancies were observed in 3 animals 
(one incidence each of lymphoma, myeloid leukaemia, and 
lymphoid leukaemia) out of a total of 44 examined in the 
highest dose group (10 mg/kg). Although lymphoma and 
leukaemia are common in rats at the end of 2 years, the 
presence of these tumours in rats < 26 weeks of age in the 
high-dose group is unusual and the relationship to 
luspatercept therapy cannot be ruled out. In addition, during 
the 3-month study in rats, an adult female rat in the high-dose 
(15 mg/kg) group was found dead during study Week 11, with 
a diagnosis of disseminated pleomorphic lymphoma. This 
tumour was considered a spontaneous occurrence and not 
related to luspatercept. No other tumour findings have been 
seen in studies with luspatercept in adult rats or monkeys. A 
pharmacokinetic (PK) comparison of juvenile rats to adult 
patients indicates a 4.4-fold difference in exposure between 
the juvenile rats dosed at 10 mg/kg and adult human patients 
at the highest recommended clinical dose (1.75 mg/kg every 
3 weeks).
No other proliferative or pre-neoplastic lesions, attributable to 
luspatercept have been observed in any species from the 
battery of nonclinical safety studies, including the 6-month 
study in monkeys.

General Safety Pharmacology
 Cardiovascular
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies with luspatercept 
have not been performed. However, safety pharmacology 
parameters were incorporated into the 1- and 3-month 
toxicology studies in monkeys. Parameters evaluated for both 
studies included cardiovascular assessments (heart rate, blood 
pressure, body temperature, and qualitative 
electrocardiograms), respiratory (respiration rate) and 
neurologic (general attitude, behaviour, motor function 
[cranial nerves II though XII], proprioception, postural 
reactions, and spinal nerves). There were no 
luspatercept-related findings for any of the above safety 
pharmacology parameters at any dose levels evaluated in the 
1-month study (30 mg/kg, SC or 10 mg/kg intravenous) or in 
the 3-month study (30 mg/kg, SC).

Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity was assessed in rat, rabbit, and monkey 
toxicity studies. In the rat, anti-luspatercept antibodies were 
observed in 63.8% and 16.7% of animals in the 3-month 
toxicology study and definitive embryo-foetal development 
studies, respectively. High-titre antibodies had a significant 
negative effect on serum levels of luspatercept in the 3-month 
rat study. Antibodies to luspatercept were also detected in 2 of 
9 rabbits (22.2%) in the definitive embryo-foetal development 
rabbit study. The presence of antibodies decreased maternal 
and foetal luspatercept concentrations in these animals 
compared to other litters in the respective dose groups. In the 
definitive juvenile rat study, the incidence of a positive anti-
drug antibody (ADA) response was low (7.8%), and in the 
non-Good Laboratory Practice rat renal toxicity study, ADA 
were measurable in 25% of luspatercept-treated animals, and 
in 33% of RAP-536-treated animals.
In the monkey, 9.5%, 9.1%, and 3.3% of animals in the 1-, 3-, 
and 6-month luspatercept toxicology studies, respectively, had 
ADAs detected. The presence of low-titre antibodies to 
luspatercept in the monkey toxicology studies did not affect 
the individual serum PK profiles with an exception of a single 
ADA-positive monkey in the 6-month monkey study after 
Day 183.
Characterisation of antibodies generated against luspatercept 
in the 1-month rat study revealed that the antibodies were 
specific to epitopes on the human immunoglobulin G1 
In MDS and TD β-thalassaemia patients in 
controlled luspatercept clinical studies, patients 
treated with luspatercept had an average increase 
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 
5 mmHg from baseline.
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, mean blood 
pressure values were generally higher in the 
luspatercept group than the placebo group, but 
remained within the normal range. In the 
luspatercept treatment group, shifts in systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure (≥ 20 mm Hg from 
baseline) were reported in 33.3% and 27.1% 
patients, respectively. 
Treatment must be started only if blood pressure 
is adequately controlled. Blood pressure should 
be monitored prior to each luspatercept 
administration. Dose adjustment may be 
required and, in case of persistent hypertension 
or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension, 
patients should be treated for hypertension as 
per current clinical guidelines.
Of the 260 MDS patients and 
380 β-thalassaemia patients (TD and non-TD) 
who were treated with luspatercept and who 
were evaluable for the presence of anti-
luspatercept antibodies, 23 (8.8%) MDS patients 
and 7 (1.84%) β-thalassaemia patients tested 
positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept 
antibodies, including 9 (3.5%) MDS patients and 
5 (1.3%) β-thalassaemia patients who had 
neutralising antibodies against luspatercept. 
Luspatercept serum concentration tended to 
decrease in the presence of neutralising 
antibodies. There was no apparent loss of the 
drug’s effectiveness except for a single isolated 
case. There were no severe systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions reported for patients 
with anti-luspatercept antibodies. There was no 
association between hypersensitivity type 
reactions or injection site reactions and presence 
of ADA. The presence of ADA therefore had a 
minimal effect on patients across the 2 
indications.

Other Toxicity-related Information
Following SC dosing in pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, 
luspatercept was transferred into milk, with mean milk to 
serum concentrations of approximately 12% over the time 
points tested.
In the pre- and postnatal development study, mean ratios of 
foetal to maternal serum luspatercept concentrations were 
18% and 9% after 8 and 24 hours, respectively, indicating that 
luspatercept can cross the placenta.
Not applicable. No formal clinical interaction 
studies have been performed. Concurrent use of 
iron-chelating agents had no effect on 
luspatercept PK.
It is unknown whether luspatercept or its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Luspatercept is transferred through the placenta 
of pregnant rats and rabbits and is excreted into 
the milk of lactating rats. Because of the 
unknown adverse effects of luspatercept in 
new-borns/infants, a decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding during 
therapy with luspatercept and for 3 months after 
the last dose or to discontinue luspatercept 
therapy, taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

MDS-001 and ACE-536-B-THAL-001. All patients who were willing to continue with the study 
have been rolled over to ACE-536-LTFU-001.
In  Study  ACE-536-B-THAL-002,  a  total  of  89  (92.7%)  patients  receiving  luspatercept  and 
35 (71.4%) patients receiving placebo completed 48 weeks of treatment. Patients enrolled in ACE-
536-B-THAL-002  continue  therapy  as  the  study  has  been  unblinded;  those  on  placebo  will  be 
eligible to receive luspatercept.
There are also data available for luspatercept in MDS and TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia from 
Phase 2 single-arm studies:
 Study A536-03 is a completed open label, multiple ascending-dose study of luspatercept for 
the treatment of anaemia in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low-
or intermediate-1-risk MDS.
 Study A536-05 is a completed open label extension study to evaluate the long-term effects of 
luspatercept for the treatment in patients who were previously enrolled in Study A536-03.
 Study  A536-04  is  a  completed  open  label,  ascending-dose  study  of  luspatercept  for  the 
treatment of TD and non-TD patients with β-thalassaemia.
 Study A536-06 is a completed open label extension study to evaluate the long-term effects of 
luspatercept in patients previously enrolled in Study A536-04.
2.3.2
Patient Exposure
Up to 24-Jun-2021, a cumulative total of 1,025 patients received treatment with  luspatercept in 
BMS-sponsored  clinical  trials.  These  patients  were  exposed  to  luspatercept in  blinded  and 
unblinded fashion. Exposure was based on populations defined by protocol or as estimated from 
randomization scheme for the study, if appropriate. Other treatment arms included epoetin alfa or 
placebo.
The MDS and TD β-thalassaemia luspatercept data pool consists of patients who were treated with 
luspatercept  in  Studies A536-02,  A536-03,  A536-04,  A536-05,  A536-06,  ACE-536-MDS-001 
(unblinded),  and  ACE-536-B-THAL-001  (unblinded).  Overall,  571  patients  in  the  luspatercept 
data  pool  received  at  least  1 dose  of  luspatercept,  representing  an  overall  exposure  of 
601.66 person-years,  compared  with  193 patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  placebo, 
representing  an  overall  exposure  of  168.24 person-years.  The  2:1  randomisation  scheme 
in  studies  ACE-536-MDS-001  and  ACE-536-B-THAL-001 
(luspatercept:placebo)  used 
contributes to the person-year difference observed. The median duration of treatment was higher 
in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the pooled placebo treatment group (55.1 versus 
49.7 weeks, respectively). Similarly, patients in the pooled luspatercept treatment group received 
more doses of luspatercept than patients in the pooled placebo treatment group (median 18.0 versus 
16.0 doses, respectively). In both treatment groups, the median length of cycle between doses was 
21.0 days, which is consistent with the every 3-week dosing regimen.
A total of 153 and 223 patients were treated with at least 1 dose of luspatercept in the Phase 3, 
and 
double-blind, 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001, respectively, representing exposures of a median of 49.0 weeks (range:

5.9 to 113.9 weeks; 136.7 person-years) and a median of 63.3 weeks (range: 1.7 to 93.7 weeks; 
259.8 person-years), respectively.
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 in non-TD β-thalassaemia, the median treatment duration was 
longer in the luspatercept treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (99.7 versus 
61.1 weeks). The median number of doses received was 28.5 in the luspatercept treatment group 
and 20.0 in the placebo treatment group. The median length of cycle between doses was 22.4 days 
in  the  luspatercept  treatment  group  and  21.7  days  in  the  placebo  treatment  group,  which  is 
consistent with the every 3-week dosing regimen. A total of 96 patients received at least 1 dose of 
luspatercept for an overall cumulative exposure of 172.91 patient-years, compared with 49 patients 
who received at least 1 dose of placebo for an overall cumulative exposure of 61.96 patient-years.
Exposure  data  for  luspatercept  in  Studies ACE-536-MDS-001,  ACE-536-B-THAL-001,  and 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 are included in Table 2.3.2-1 to Table 2.3.2-4.

Is it considered to be included as missing 
information?
If No, rationale
 Not considered to be missing information.

The safety of luspatercept in patients with a history 
of malignancy has not been established in clinical 
practice and no carcinogenicity or mutagenicity 
studies have been conducted as luspatercept is a 
biologic. MDS is a malignant disease with great 
propensity to progress to other malignancies. Based 
on analyses of the pivotal registration studies, there 
is no evidence that luspatercept increases the risk of 
malignancies.
 Although there was no imbalance in malignancies 
in the MDS clinical programme and no 
malignancies reported in luspatercept-treated 
patients in the TD β-thalassaemia population up 
until the data cut-offs in this RMP, long-term data 
are limited. No malignancies have been reported in 
luspatercept-treated patients in Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002.
 Haematologic malignancy (including AML) is 
considered an important potential risk.
 Not considered to be missing information.

The safety of luspatercept in these patients has not 
been established in clinical practice. There is no 
evidence that luspatercept increases the overall risk 
of infections or causes immunosuppression. These 
patients may benefit from treatment with 
luspatercept by reducing the number of transfusions 
and improvement of underlying anaemia.
 Not considered to be missing information.
 No effects on left ventricular ejection fraction, 
electrocardiogram variables, or vital signs have 
been observed in studies with luspatercept. No 
patient had a TEAE in the Cardiac disorders system 
organ class that led to discontinuation of 
luspatercept. TEAEs generally correlated with the

and with what could be expected in the population 
of older patients with haematologic malignancies.

TEE is considered an important identified risk in 
the TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia population with 
splenectomy.
 Overall, the safety profile of luspatercept does not 
suggest a need for its limitation in patients with 
significant cardiac disease.
 Not considered to be missing information.

Population PK analysis for luspatercept included 
patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic 
impairment, moderate hepatic impairment, or severe 
hepatic impairment as defined by the National 
Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction.

Effects of hepatic function categories, elevated liver 
enzymes and elevated total bilirubin on luspatercept 
clearance were not observed. No clinically 
significant difference in mean steady state 
maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) was found across 
hepatic function groups. 
 No starting dose adjustment is required for patients 
with total bilirubin > ULN and/or ALT or AST 
< 3 × ULN. No specific dose recommendation can 
be made for patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN 
or liver injury Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events Grade ≥ 3 due to lack of clinical 
data.
 Not considered to be missing information.

Luspatercept is not expected to be excreted into 
urine due to its large molecular mass that is above 
the glomerular filtration size exclusion threshold. 
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included 
patients with normal renal function, mild renal 
impairment, or moderate renal impairment. 
 No clinically significant difference in mean steady 
state Cmax and AUC was found across renal 
function groups. PK data are not available for 
patients with severe renal impairment or end stage 
kidney disease. 
 Overall, the safety profile of luspatercept does not 
suggest a need for its limitation in patients with 
renal impairment.

In β-thalassaemia studies, patients with platelets 
> 1000 × 109/L have been excluded to decrease the 
risk of patients exposed to risk of TEEs during 
treatment. In the TD β-thalassaemia data pool, 
14.6% of luspatercept-treated patients and 9.2% of 
placebo-treated patients had platelet counts 
≥ 1000 × 109 cells/L that occurred during treatment. 
 None of the patients with platelet count 

≥ 1000 × 109 cells/L had a concurrent TEE. 
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
(non-TD β-thalassaemia patients), 5 patients in each 
treatment group (16.7% and 19.2% of patients in 
the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively) had postbaseline values ≥ 1000 ×
109/L.
 Overall, the safety profile of luspatercept does not 
suggest a need for its limitation in β-thalassaemia 
patients with thrombocytosis. However, TEE is 
considered an important identified risk in the TD 
and non-TD β-thalassaemia population with 
splenectomy. Thrombocytosis is often a 
complication of splenectomy and it is an added risk 
factor for TEEs and should be evaluated in this 
context.

Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies
Exclusion criteria
Chronic steroid use 
Pregnant or lactating females
Reason for 
exclusion
Chronic steroid use 
can further 
compromise the 
immune system, 
putting the patient at 
risk of infections. 
Such concomitant 
medications could 
influence the 
interpretation of the 
study data.
Pregnant and 
lactating females are 
excluded to avoid 
potential harm to the 
unborn foetus or 
breast-feeding 
new-born.
Is it considered to be included as missing 
information?
If No, rationale
 Not considered to be missing information.

In β-thalassaemia studies, chronic systemic 
glucocorticoids ≤ 12 weeks prior to randomisation 
(physiologic replacement therapy for adrenal 
insufficiency is allowed) has been implemented to 
clarify the adrenal insufficiency exclusion criteria, 
as per the original protocol.

These patients may benefit from treatment with 
luspatercept and so should not be excluded from 
treatment with luspatercept. 
 As luspatercept is a biologic, it is unlikely that it 
would interact with other medicinal products.
 Not considered to be missing information.

Luspatercept is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
Women of childbearing potential have to use 
effective contraception during treatment with 
luspatercept and for at least 3 months after the last 
dose. Prior to starting treatment with luspatercept, a 
pregnancy test has to be performed for WCBP. 
Treatment with luspatercept should not be started if 
the woman is pregnant. If a patient becomes 
pregnant, luspatercept should be discontinued. 
 Because of the unknown adverse effects of 
luspatercept in new-borns/infants, a decision must 
be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
during therapy with luspatercept and for 3 months 
after the last dose or to discontinue luspatercept 
therapy, taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

Limitations of Adverse Drug Reaction Detection in Clinical Trial 
Development Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure.
2.4.3
Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programmes
To  ensure  patient  safety,  specific  populations  of  patients  were  excluded  from  the  pivotal  and 
supportive studies. Thus, experience in these populations is limited (Table 2.5.1.2-1).

Exposure
In the MDS Data Pool, 206/260 (79.2%) patients exposed to luspatercept were 
≥ 65 years of age. In Study ACE-536-MDS-001, 124 (81.0%) patients exposed to 
luspatercept were ≥ 65 years of age.
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with ages ranging from 18 to 
95 years old, with a median age of 72 years for patients with MDS and of 33 years for 
patients with β-thalassaemia. No clinically significant difference in AUC or clearance 
was found across age groups in MDS patients (< 65, 65 to 74, and ≥ 75 years) or in 
β-thalassaemia patients (18 to 71 years).
There was no notable effect of age on the overall incidence of patients who reported 
TEAEs. The incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal was 
higher in luspatercept- and placebo-treated patients ≥ 65 years of age compared with 
those < 65 years of age, but the difference between age groups was more pronounced in 
active-treated patients than placebo patients. The majority of most frequently reported 
serious AEs (SAEs) were age- and/or disease-related.
Patient age had no clinically significant effect on luspatercept exposure or clearance. No 
starting dose adjustment is required for elderly patients.
Patients with relevant comorbidities:
Patients with renal 
impairment
Patients with hepatic 
impairment
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal renal function 
(eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 315), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 
89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 171), or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 
59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 59). No clinically significant difference in mean steady state 
Cmax and AUC was found across renal function groups. PK data are not available for 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end stage 
kidney disease.
Population PK analysis for luspatercept included patients with normal hepatic function 
(bilirubin, ALT, and AST ≤ ULN; n = 207), mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
> 1 to 1.5 × ULN, or ALT or AST > ULN; n = 160), moderate hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 × ULN, any ALT or AST; n = 138), or severe hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin > 3 × ULN, any ALT or AST; n = 40) as defined by the National Cancer 
Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction. Effects of hepatic function categories, elevated 
liver enzymes (ALT or AST, up to 3 × ULN) and elevated total bilirubin (4 to 
246 µmol/L) on luspatercept clearance were not observed. No clinically significant 
difference in mean steady state Cmax and AUC was found across hepatic function 
groups. Pharmacokinetic data are insufficient for patients with liver enzymes (ALT or 
AST) ≥ 3 × ULN.
Patients with 
cardiovascular 
impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted. In Studies ACE-536-MDS-001, 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001, and ACE-536-B-THAL-002, 59 (38.6%), 42 (18.8%), and 
15 (15.6%) luspatercept-treated patients, respectively, had a medical history within the 
system organ class of cardiac disorders.
Immunocompromised 
patients
No formal studies have been conducted. No luspatercept-treated patients in 
Studies ACE-536-MDS-001 and ACE-536-B-THAL-001 had a medical history 
preferred term (PT) of immunosuppression. A total of 2 (1.3%) luspatercept-treated 
patients in Study ACE-536-MDS-001 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants 
(both leflunomide).

In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, 59 (61.5%) patients exposed to luspatercept were 
White, 31 (32.3%) patients were Asian, and 6 (6.3%) patients were of “Other” race.
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, determination of β-thalassaemia genotype grouping 
showed that 68/224 (30.4%) luspatercept-treated patients were β0/β0, which is 
indicative of a greater severity of disease; 155/224 (69.2%) luspatercept-treated patients 
were non-β0/β0 and 1/224 (0.4%) luspatercept-treated patient had missing data.
There was no clinically significant effect on luspatercept clearance in β0/β0 versus 
non-β0/β0 patients.
In the MDS and β-thalassaemia pivotal registration studies, a wide range of patients 
were enrolled, and the reported medical histories of patients were consistent with the 
disease population and known comorbidities, and were also generally comparable 
between treatment groups. The safety profile of luspatercept did not change when 
luspatercept was given alone or in combination with medications used for a wide range 
of comorbid conditions.

2.5.1.1
Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The methodology for estimating commercial patient exposure utilizes up to 3 data sources:
1. Sales/Shipment Data – this data consists of all shipments of Company product to all applicable 
countries and includes commercial and free-of-charge units for both branded and generic product 
(as applicable). The data are used to determine the units (eg, milligrams) of a product that was sold 
to a geography to estimate the number of patients who would have been exposed to that product, 
based on expected dosing in the geography. Shipment data are used to estimate the active patients 
for  a  period  of  time  by  dividing  the  total  units  sold  by  the  average  units  per  patient  (note that 
average units per patient is derived from epidemiologic or market research).
2. Claims Data – this data consists of 2 distinct sources of electronic health care claims data in 
the  USA:  Optum  Clinformatics  Datamart  and  Symphony  Claims  for  Hem/Onc.  Claims  data 
consisting  of  distinct  patient  identities  and  prescription  fill  rates  for  each  product  are  used  to 
understand usage patterns. For newly approved products, until sufficient claims data are available, 
patterns are based on discontinuation rates derived from clinical trial experience.
3. Controlled Distribution Database – this data source is not applicable for luspatercept, since 
luspatercept does not have a controlled distribution program.

Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
No potential for drug dependence, misuse or abuse has been noted for luspatercept in any of the 
clinical studies. However, there is the potential that luspatercept could be illicitly used as a doping 
agent  to  artificially  increase  the  amount  of  RBC  mass  in  the  body  which  allows  the  body  to 
transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina in an attempt to improve athletic


Identified Risk: 
Hypersensitivity type 
reactions and 
immunogenicity
Luspatercept is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to luspatercept or to 
any of the excipients. 
Hypersensitivity type reactions (including eyelid oedema, drug hypersensitivity, 
swelling face, periorbital oedema, face oedema, angioedema, lip swelling, and drug 
eruption) and injection site reactions (including injection site erythema, injection site 
pruritus, injection site swelling, and injection site rash) are commonly reported 
ADRs in patients treated with luspatercept.
Immunogenicity type reaction AEs were reported in 16.3% and 10.5% of 
luspatercept- and placebo-treated MDS patients, respectively, in 
Study ACE-536-MDS-001, and in 23.3% and 19.3% of β-thalassaemia patients, 
respectively, in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001. No anaphylactic reactions have been 
reported in the luspatercept clinical programme. In clinical studies, all events were 
Grade 1 or 2. One (0.4%) β-thalassaemia patient in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 
discontinued luspatercept due to a hypersensitivity event.
In clinical studies in MDS, an analysis of 260 MDS patients who were treated with 
luspatercept and who were evaluable for the presence of anti-luspatercept antibodies 
showed that 23 (8.8%) MDS patients tested positive for treatment-emergent 
anti-luspatercept antibodies, including 9 (3.5%) MDS patients who had neutralising 
antibodies against luspatercept.
In clinical studies in β-thalassaemia, an analysis of 284 β-thalassaemia patients who 
were treated with luspatercept and who were evaluable for the presence of 
anti-luspatercept antibodies showed that 4 (1.4%) β-thalassaemia patients tested 
positive for treatment-emergent anti-luspatercept antibodies, including 
2 (0.7%) β-thalassaemia patients who had neutralising antibodies against 
luspatercept. 
Luspatercept serum concentration tended to decrease in the presence of neutralising 
antibodies. There were no severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions reported for 
patients with anti-luspatercept antibodies. There was no association between 
hypersensitivity type reactions or injection site reactions and presence of ADA.

Patients treated with luspatercept had an average increase in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure of 5 mmHg from baseline. 
Hypertension (including essential hypertension, hypertension, and hypertensive 
crisis) is commonly reported in patients treated with luspatercept. Hypertension was 
reported in 8.5% and 9.2% of luspatercept- and placebo-treated MDS patients, 
respectively, in Study ACE-536-MDS-001, and in 8.1% and 3.7% of 
luspatercept- and placebo-treated β-thalassaemia patients, respectively, in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001.
In MDS patients, Grade 3 events were reported for 5 patients (3.3%) treated with 
luspatercept and in 3 patients (3.9%) receiving placebo. In β-thalassaemia patients, 
Grade 3 events were reported for 4 patients (1.8%) treated with luspatercept (0% 
placebo). There were no Grade 4 events, no serious events, and no hypertension 
events leading to treatment discontinuation.
Blood pressure should be monitored prior to each luspatercept administration. In 
case of new-onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension, 
patients should be treated for hypertension as per current clinical guidelines. 
Hypertension is easily treatable and does not impact the risk-benefit profile of 
luspatercept.
Events of hypertension will be monitored as per local standard of care and routine 
pharmacovigilance activities including signal detection activities apply.
Syncope has been reported with luspatercept. In Study ACE-536-MDS-001, 
syncope/presyncope was reported in 6.5% of patients treated with luspatercept and 
1.3% with placebo. A total of 5 luspatercept-treated patients and 1 placebo-treated 
patient in Study ACE-536-MDS-001 experienced Grade 3 syncope. Three events 
were reported as SAEs; 1 was associated with an orthostatic dysregulation, 
1 described as a vasovagal episode and 1 was associated with intercurrent heart 
failure. All events resolved and did not reoccur despite treatment continuation. In 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, syncope/presyncope was reported in 3.6% of 
patients treated with luspatercept and 0.9% with placebo. Four patients experienced 
Grade 3 syncope, none of which was considered serious, all transient and recovering 
in the same day and not reoccurring despite treatment continuation at the same dose 
level.
Bone pain is a very commonly experienced ADR on treatment with luspatercept, 
especially in β-thalassaemia patients. Bone pain may occur more frequently at the 
start of treatment (during the first 4 cycles; 12 weeks).
Bone pain was reported in 19.7% and 8.3% of luspatercept- and placebo-treated 
β-thalassaemia patients, respectively, in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, and in 2.6% 
and 3.9% of MDS patients, respectively, in Study ACE-536-MDS-001. In 
β-thalassaemia patients treated with luspatercept, bone pain was most common in 
the first 3 months (16.6%) compared to Months 4 to 6 (3.7%). Most events (41/44

discontinuation.
In the pivotal BMS-sponsored phase 3 studies (ACE-536-MDS-001 and 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001), kidney injury has been observed in 9.8% and 3.6% of 
luspatercept-treated MDS and β-thalassaemia patients, respectively, and 5.3% and 
2.8% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. There were no SAEs of kidney injury 
in luspatercept-treated patients with β-thalassaemia; 2.0% of luspatercept-treated 
MDS patients experienced an SAE of kidney injury. Administration of luspatercept 
was not associated with prolonged or irreversible worsening of clinically important 
indicators of kidney injury, including CrCl and ACR measurements, over the course 
of treatment. No mean changes of clinical concern were observed in CrCl during 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 and there was no clinically important difference 
between luspatercept- and placebo-treated patients or change in mean ACR over 
time in the β-thalassaemia population. In summary, no adverse effect of luspatercept 
on renal function was observed in clinical studies, and hence there is no impact on 
the risk-benefit profile. Patients with renal impairment at baseline should be closely 
monitored for renal function as per standard of care. 
Events of kidney injury will be monitored as per local standard of care through 
routine adverse reaction reporting, including during the BMS-sponsored long-term 
follow-up Study ACE-536-LTFU-001.

TEEs (only in 
the TD and

population with

Risk-benefit Impact
TEEs are common complications of thalassaemia especially in splenectomised patients. In 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, embolic and thrombotic events and thrombophlebitis were 
observed in a greater proportion of luspatercept-treated patients with β-thalassaemia (4.0%) 
compared to placebo-treated patients with β-thalassaemia (0.9%). Device occlusion does not 
clinically qualify as a TEE. Excluding the device occlusion, there were 8 patients (3.6%) in 
the luspatercept treatment group who reported TEE events. Six (2.7%) luspatercept-treated 
patients experienced thromboembolic SAEs, 2 of whom experienced Grade 3 or 4 events.
TEEs were restricted to splenectomised patients with multiple risk factors for the reported
embolic/thrombotic event including thrombocytosis, relevant cardiovascular history (heart 
failure, cardiac siderosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, tricuspid 
insufficiency, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary hypertension) for developing cerebrovascular 
accident or transient ischaemic attack, thromboembolism risk factors (smoking, diabetes, 
obesity, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sedentary lifestyle), and hormonal 
replacement therapy for the development of DVT, pulmonary embolism, and other 
thrombotic event. No patient had concurrent hypertension at the time of the TEE.
The risk of TEEs is higher in splenectomised patients with β-thalassaemia.
Further data are being collected during the BMS-sponsored long-term follow-up 
Study ACE-536-LTFU-001.

Risk-benefit Impact
Malignancies in general may result in significant morbidity and mortality, depending on the 
type, and impact on the patient’s activities of daily living.
Haematologic malignancies (PT of progression to AML only) were observed in 2.0% of 
luspatercept-treated MDS patients and 1.3% of placebo-treated patients in 
Study ACE-536-MDS-001 (exposure-adjusted incidence rate [EAIR] was 2.2 per 
100,000 person-years for both groups). All events were serious and of Grade 3 or 4 severity. 
There was no observed incremental risk associated with luspatercept administration for 
haematologic malignancies.
No haematologic malignancies have been observed with luspatercept in the β-thalassaemia 
population as of the data lock point of this submission. One event of erythroleukaemia (AML 
M6) was reported in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 in Nov 2018. Due to the difficulty in 
diagnosing AML M6 against a background of β-thalassaemia, an independent expert 
haematopathologist was engaged to review extensive morphologic and genetic analyses in this 
case. The independent expert haematopathologist concluded that a diagnosis of AML M6 in 
this patient was very unlikely. The independent data monitoring committee considered the 
case to be consistent with β-thalassaemia major complicated by splenomegaly, neutropenia, 
and sepsis, possibly triggered by deferiprone therapy. The patient subsequently died.
Although there was no imbalance in malignancies in the MDS clinical programme and no 
malignancies reported in the β-thalassaemia population up until the data cut-off, the data set is 
limited and therefore haematologic malignancy (including AML) is considered an important 
potential risk. Further data will be collected during the BMS-sponsored long-term follow-up 
Study ACE-536-LTFU-001.
The target population is adults as reflected in the luspatercept SmPC. 
Studies in animals have shown developmental toxicity following luspatercept administration; 
however, the relevance of the juvenile nonclinical findings in rats to development in paediatric 
patients is unknown. 
There is no relevant use of luspatercept in the paediatric population for the indication of MDS 
or in paediatric patients less than 6 months of age in β-thalassaemia. The safety and efficacy of 
luspatercept in paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less than 18 years have not yet been 
established in β-thalassaemia. There are currently no available data from the use of 
luspatercept in paediatric patients.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following luspatercept administration. 
Luspatercept was detected in the milk of lactating rats, and based on findings in animals, 
luspatercept may compromise female fertility.
There are no data from the use of luspatercept in pregnant women, it is unknown whether 
luspatercept or its metabolites are excreted in human milk, and the effect of luspatercept on 
fertility in humans is unknown.
Luspatercept is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential have to 
use effective contraception during treatment with luspatercept and for at least 3 months after 
the last dose. Prior to starting treatment with luspatercept, a pregnancy test has to be 
performed for WCBP. Treatment with luspatercept should not be started if the woman is 
pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant, luspatercept should be discontinued.

Thromboembolic Events (Only in the TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia Population with Splenectomy)
Potential Mechanisms
No mechanism by which luspatercept may cause TEEs has been identified.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
There is a known risk of TEEs in patients with splenectomy (Natesirinilkul, 2016).51 In 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, embolic and thrombotic events and thrombophlebitis were observed in a greater 
proportion of luspatercept-treated patients (4.0%) compared to placebo-treated patients (0.9%) with TD 
β-thalassaemia. Device occlusion does not clinically qualify as a TEE. Excluding the device occlusion, there were 
8 TD β-thalassaemia patients (3.6%) in the luspatercept treatment group who reported TEE events. All cases of 
TEEs were consistent with the literature and reported in patients who have had a splenectomy and who had at 
least 1 other risk factor for developing a TEE (including history of thrombocytosis or hormone replacement 
therapy). The occurrence of TEEs was not correlated with elevated haemoglobin levels. No patient had 
concurrent hypertension at the time of the TEE.

In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, the proportion of patients experiencing at least 1 TEE was greater among 
luspatercept-treated patients compared to patients receiving placebo (relative risk = 4.4 [95% CI = 0.5 to 42.5]). 
Reported PTs in luspatercept-treated patients were DVT (3 patients), cerebrovascular accident and 
thrombophlebitis superficial (2 patients each), and device occlusion (not clinically consistent with TEEs), 
ischaemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (1 patient each).
Non-TD β-thalassaemia
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, no TEE events have been reported in either treatment group.
Seriousness/Outcomes 
TD β-thalassaemia
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, serious TEEs were experienced by 6 (2.7%) luspatercept-treated patients; PTs 
reported in the luspatercept group included cerebrovascular accident and DVT (2 patients each), and portal vein 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis superficial (1 patient each).

Device occlusion does not clinically qualify as a TEE. Excluding the device occlusion (nonserious Grade 1 event that did 
a
not lead to discontinuation or dose modification), there were 8 patients (3.6%) in the luspatercept treatment group who 
reported TEE events.
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001, Grade 3 or Grade 4 events were experienced in 2 luspatercept-treated patients 
(PTs: cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism). A total of 4 (1.8%) luspatercept-treated patients 
discontinued study treatment due to embolic and thrombotic events and thrombophlebitis (DVT [2 patients] and 
portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis superficial [1 patient each]).
Risk Groups and Risk Factors
TEEs are common complications of thalassaemia, especially thalassaemia intermedia. The increased risk of TEEs 
is likely due to abnormalities in platelet, RBC, endothelial cell, and thrombin activation which all contribute to 
hypercoagulable state (Thiersch, 2017;62 Taher, 2010a;63 Taher, 2010b64).
In addition to these haematological abnormalities, splenectomy has also been shown to be a major risk factor 
contributing to hypercoagulability among patients with thalassaemia (Natesirinilkul, 2016).51
Additional risk factors for TEEs in β-thalassaemia include age, iron overload, thrombocytosis, hormone 
replacement therapy, cardiac and endocrine disease, all common in this patient population. Furthermore, patients 
may also be at risk of TEEs due to other conventional risk factors similar to the nonthalassaemia population 
(Taher, 2010a;63 Taher, 2010b64).
Preventability
Due to the risk of TEEs in splenectomised patients with β-thalassaemia, it is prudent to inform treating physicians 
about this identified risk, so they can work with patients to address modifiable risk factors. The potential benefit 
of treatment with luspatercept should be weighed against the identified risk of TEEs in β-thalassaemia patients 
with a splenectomy and other risk factors for developing a TEE. Thromboprophylaxis according to current 
clinical guidelines should be considered in patients with β-thalassaemia at higher risk.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
TEEs are common complications of thalassaemia. There is a known risk of TEEs in patients with splenectomy 
(Natesirinilkul, 2016).51
Public Health Impact
The annual incidence of venous TEEs is more than one per thousand in the general population 
(Cushman, 2007).65
In one study, 22.5% of splenectomised patients developed TEEs compared to 3.5% in nonsplenectomised 
patients, and the relative risk of developing a TEE was 6.59 (95% CI, 3.09 to 14.05) compared to the 
nonsplenectomised patients. The rate (prevalence) of TEEs in TD β-thalassaemia patients varies between 5.2% 
and 6.3% (Moratelli, 1998;66 Taher, 2010c67).

Important Identified Risk: EMH Masses (In the TD and non-TD β 
thalassaemia Population)
EMH Masses (In the TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia Population)
Potential Mechanisms
The mechanism of action of the potential connection between luspatercept (either direct or indirect) and EMH is 
not known, but could be associated with the increased production of endogenous erythropoietin. As a result of 
ineffective red blood cell production by the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis) in ß-thalassaemia, a forced 
expansion of the hematopoietic tissue outside the marrow medulla appears and leads to hematopoietic 
compensatory involvement, mostly in the form of masses in other regions in the body; this phenomenon is termed 
EMH.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
In transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients, EMH masses were observed in 3.2% (10/315) of patients 
treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study and in the long-term follow-up study (Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-001/ACE-536-LTFU-001). Spinal cord compression symptoms due to EMH masses occurred 
in 1.9% (6/315) of patients treated with luspatercept.
In non transfusion dependent thalassaemia patients, EMH masses were observed in 6.3% (6/96) of patients 
treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study. Spinal cord compression due to EMH masses occurred in 1.0% 
(1/96) of patients treated with luspatercept. During the open-label portion of the study, EMH masses were 
observed in 2 additional patients for a total of 8/134 (6.0%) of patients.

Risk Groups and Risk Factors
Extramedullary haemopoiesis is among the 3 most common complications, and prevalence of EMH masses has 
been reported as approximately 20% to 25% (Taher, 2010c;67 Winichakoon, 201568). Among patients with no 
previous transfusions, approximately 60.0% have disease-related complications of extramedullary haemopoiesis, 
whereas among patients with regular transfusions (TD β-thalassaemia), approximately 4.0% have disease-related 
complications of extramedullary haemopoiesis (Taher, 2010b).64 Extramedullary haemopoiesis is a complication 
due to ineffective erythropoiesis or inadequate bone marrow function and is seen to occur in patients with 
β-thalassaemia and other chronic haematologic disorders. In patients with such disorders, the ineffective 
erythropoiesis or inadequate bone marrow function can potentially precipitate extra marrow production of blood 
elements (ie, extramedullary haemopoiesis) (Orphanidou-Vlachou, 2014).69 Expansion of the erythron in the 
bone marrow in non-TD β-thalassaemia during ineffective erythropoiesis is associated with homing and 
proliferation of erythroid precursors in the spleen and liver as a physiologic compensatory phenomenon, which 
leads to hepatosplenomegaly. Ineffective erythropoiesis in non-TD β-thalassaemia patients also forces expansion 
of the hematopoietic tissue in areas other than the liver and spleen, mostly in the form of masses termed 
extramedullary hematopoietic pseudotumours (Rivella, 2009;70 Rivella, 2012).71
Risk factors associated with β-thalassaemia EMH include: males, splenectomy, IVS-I-6 either in homozygosity or 
compound heterozygosity, higher levels of GDF15 and erythropoietin, and fewer red blood cell transfusions 
(Ricchi, 2014;55 Sousos, 2017;58 Ricchi, 201556).
Chronic anaemia has been shown to lead to increased levels of erythropoietin and overstimulation of early stage 
erythropoiesis. For patients with β-thalassaemia, this may result in EMH, primarily in the spleen 
(Sleiman, 2018).72
Preventability
The potential benefit of treatment with luspatercept should be weighed against the potential risk for EMH masses 
complications in TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia patients. Luspatercept is contraindicated in patients requiring 
treatment to control the growth of EMH masses. Patients with EMH masses may experience worsening of these 
masses and complications during treatment. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on anatomical location. 
Patients should be monitored at initiation and during treatment for symptoms and signs or complications resulting 
from the EMH masses, and be treated according to clinical guidelines. Treatment with luspatercept must be 
discontinued in case of serious complications due to EMH masses.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
Extramedullary hematopoietic pseudotumours can occur anywhere in the body and can cause great health risks 
especially when surrounding vital structure like the spinal cord, as they can lead to permanent damage and 
disability (Haidar, 2010),47 if not diagnosed and managed acutely. A paraspinal location for the hematopoietic 
tissue occurs in 11% to 15% of cases with EMH Paraspinal EMH mainly presents as pseudotumours, which may 
cause a variety of neurological symptoms due to spinal compression. More than 80% of cases may remain 
asymptomatic and the lesions are discovered incidentally by imaging. The development of neurologic symptoms 
depends on the chronicity of the disease with neurologic symptoms most frequently being reported during the 
third and fourth decades of life (Haidar, 2010).47
Based on the cumulative review of the available safety information across all β-thalassaemia studies, the reported 
EMH-type events appear to be mainly associated with the patients’ pre-existing β-thalassaemia and less with the 
administration of luspatercept.

Haematologic Malignancies (Including AML)
Potential Mechanisms
No mechanism whereby luspatercept may cause haematological malignancies (including AML) has been 
identified for patients in the MDS and β-thalassaemia populations.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
In a toxicity study conducted in juvenile rats, 3 of the 44 rats examined in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg) had 
haematologic malignancies (one incidence each of lymphoma, myeloid leukaemia, and lymphoid leukaemia). In 
Study ACE-536-MDS-001, haematologic malignancies (PTs of transformation to AML only) were observed in 
2.0% of luspatercept-treated MDS patients; the follow-up-adjusted incidence rate was 1.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 
5.22 per 100,000 person-years). There was no observed incremental risk associated with luspatercept 
administration for haematologic malignancies. 
No haematologic malignancies have been observed with luspatercept in the TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia 
population as of the data lock point. One event of erythroleukaemia (AML M6) was reported in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 in Nov 2018. An independent expert haematopathologist concluded that a 
diagnosis of AML M6 in this patient was very unlikely. The independent data monitoring committee considered 
the clinical course to be consistent with β-thalassaemia major complicated by splenomegaly, neutropenia, and 
sepsis, possibly triggered by deferiprone therapy. The patient subsequently died.
Available clinical data do not suggest a relationship of transformation/development of higher risk MDS/AML 
with luspatercept treatment.

No haematologic malignancies have been observed with luspatercept in the TD β-thalassaemia population as of

. Due to the difficulty in diagnosing AML M6 against a background 
of β-thalassaemia, an independent expert haematopathologist was engaged to review extensive morphologic and 
genetic analyses in this case. The independent expert haematopathologist concluded that a diagnosis of AML M6 
in this patient was very unlikely. The independent data monitoring committee considered the clinical course to be 
consistent with β-thalassaemia major complicated by splenomegaly, neutropenia, and sepsis, possibly triggered

Risk Groups and Risk Factors
Progression to AML is well known as part of the progression of the disease (up to 25% of patients) and is 
associated with baseline factors (Greenberg, 2012).73
Steensma et al. studied risk stratification according to the IPSS in 816 patients and found a time to 25% 
leukaemia progression being 9.4 years for IPSS low-risk, 3.3 years for IPSS intermediate-1-risk, 1.1 years for 
IPSS intermediate-2 risk, and 0.2 years for IPSS high risk (Steensma, 2006).28 Thus, assuming a linear 
progression, the 1-year risk of AML in MDS is approximately 2.6% (IPSS low-risk) to 7.6% (IPSS intermediate-
1-risk).
Using the WHO classification system, Malcovati (Malcovati, 2005)74 assessed the role of the main prognostic 
factors for progression to leukaemia and overall survival (OS) in 476 patients first diagnosed with de novo MDS 
in Italy between 1992 and 2002. Malcovati reported a negative effect of developing a transfusion requirement on 
OS in patients with refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts or MDS with del(5q) (hazard 
ratio [HR] = 3.46). 
In a further development of the WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System a learning cohort of 
426 Italian MDS patients and a validation cohort of 193 evaluable German MDS patients was reported by 
Malcovati (Malcovati, 2007).75 In a multivariable analysis of the Italian patients stratified by WHO subgroups, 
cytogenetics and transfusion requirement significantly affected OS (HR = 1.48 and HR = 2.53, respectively) and 
risk of AML (HR = 1.3 and HR = 2.4, respectively). In a multivariable analysis of the German MDS patients 
stratified by WHO subgroups, cytogenetics and transfusion dependency retained a significant effect on both OS 
(HR = 1.84 and HR = 1.85, respectively) and risk of AML (HR = 2.27 and HR = 2.25, respectively).
Mallo (Mallo, 2011)76 reported the results of a cooperative study designed to assess prognostic factors for OS 
and progression to AML in 541 patients with de novo MDS and del 5q. In multivariate analyses the most 
important predictors of both OS and AML progression were number of chromosomal abnormalities (p < 0.001 for 
both outcomes), platelet count (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and proportion of bone marrow blasts 
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Transfusion burden was not addressed in this study.
In a multicentre study conducted in Iran between 2002 and 2007, haematologic malignancy in patients with 
β-thalassaemia was evaluated. The proportion of patients with cancer was higher in those with β-thalassaemia 
intermedia compared with β-thalassaemia major. Cancer was diagnosed in patients aged 0 to 39 years, but not in 
any of the older patients (Karimi, 2009).59
Preventability
Prescribers should consider the potential risk of haematologic malignancies (including AML) prior to treatment 
initiation and to detect haematologic malignancies as early as possible so that appropriate therapy can be provided 
to improve outcome.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
Haematologic malignancy (including AML) may result in significant morbidity and mortality. It impacts the 
patient’s activities of daily living.

Public Health Impact 
Haematologic malignancies (including AML) may result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the 
type. They impact the patient’s activities of daily living. 
Prior tumours have been reported as a comorbidity in approximately 15% of patients with MDS 
(Falantes, 201730; Balleari, 201531).
Follow-up-adjusted incidence rates were used to evaluate the background rate of progression to AML in similar 
populations from 4 lenalidomide studies in patients with lower-risk (IPSS low- to intermediate-1-risk) MDS 
(CC-5013-MDS-003;77 CC-5013-MDS-004;78 CC-5013-MDS-005;79 CC-5013-MDS-00980). Three of these 
lenalidomide studies included patients with the del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality. Study CC-5013-MDS-005 
included a patient population who had IPSS low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS and did not have the del(5q) 
cytogenetic abnormality; therefore, this patient population most closely matched the patient population of the 
pivotal BMS-sponsored Phase 3 luspatercept Study ACE-536-MDS-001 in terms of risk of progression to AML. 
In Study CC-5013-MDS-005, the follow-up-adjusted incidence of AML progression was 1.91 per 100 person-
years (95% CI, 0.80 to 4.59) and 2.46 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.79 to 7.64) for patients who received 
lenalidomide and placebo, respectively.
The Düsseldorf MDS registry has been collecting data since 1982 when the French-American-British 
classification was published as a first robust tool for the diagnosis and classification of myeloid malignancies with 
< 30% medullary blasts and dysplasia in blood and marrow. Data from about 7400 patients are available with 
follow-up and description of diagnosis, karyotyping, progression, treatment, and causes of death (internal BMS
report). About 5% of the patients were lost to follow-up. From the Düsseldorf MDS registry, there were 2485 
patients with IPSS low- or intermediate-1-risk category who were captured in the registry, of which 2458 patients 
were evaluable for the analysis of progression to AML. In these 2458 patients with IPSS low- or intermediate-1-
risk category, the follow-up-adjusted incidence rate of AML progression was 2.82 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 
2.48 to 3.20). When the patients in the Düsseldorf MDS registry were analysed by IPSS-R very low- or low-risk 
category (N = 613), similar to the patient population of Study ACE-536-MDS-001 in terms of risk of progression 
to AML, the follow-up-adjusted incidence rate of AML progression was 2.37 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.86 
to 2.99).
Dayyani (Dayyani, 2010)81 described causes of death among 273 US patients with low-risk MDS. In this series 
of deceased patients, progression to AML occurred in 15% of patients.
The association between β-thalassaemia and haematologic malignancies has been investigated in 2 large scale 
cohort studies, both of which proposed an increased risk compared with the population (Karimi, 2009;59
Chung, 201560). In the Taiwanese cohort study (Chung, 2015)60, a 5.32-fold increased risk for haematologic 
malignancies was noted in patients with β-thalassaemia when compared with an age- and gender-matched control 
cohort. Furthermore, patients with β-thalassaemia with transfusion exhibited a 9.31-fold increased risk for 
developing haematological malignancy compared with patients who did not receive transfusion. The incidences 
of any cancer (except metastatic cancer) were reported as 3.96 and 2.60/1000 person-years for the β-thalassaemia 
and matched comparison cohorts, respectively. The overall incidence of cancer was 52% higher in the 
β-thalassaemia cohort than in the comparison cohort, with an adjusted HR of 1.54 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.07).

Important Potential Risk: Off label Use in Paediatric Patients 
(Developmental Toxicity of Luspatercept)
Off-label Use in Paediatric Patients (Developmental Toxicity of Luspatercept)
Potential Mechanisms
The exact mechanism of developmental toxicity of luspatercept when used off-label in paediatric patients has not 
been studied. 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
In a study in juvenile rats, luspatercept was administered from postnatal day 7 to 91 at 0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. 
Luspatercept-related findings unique to juvenile rats included tubular atrophy/hypoplasia of the kidney inner 
medulla, delays in the mean age of sexual maturation in males, effects on reproductive performance (lower 
mating indices), and nonadverse decreases in bone mineral density in both male and female rats. The effects on 
reproductive performance were observed after a greater than 3-month recovery period, suggesting a permanent 
effect. Although reversibility of the tubular atrophy/hypoplasia was not examined, these effects are also 
considered to be irreversible. Adverse effects on the kidney and reproductive system were observed at clinically 
relevant exposure levels and seen at the lowest dose tested and, thus, a NOAEL was not established. In addition, 
haematological malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats examined in the highest dose group (10 mg/kg). 
These findings are all considered potential risks in paediatric patients.
Characterisation of the Risk 
There is no relevant use of luspatercept in the paediatric population for the indication of MDS or in paediatric 
patients less than 6 years of age in β-thalassaemia. The safety and efficacy of luspatercept in paediatric patients 
aged from 6 years to less than 18 years have not yet been established in β-thalassaemia. 
There are currently no available data from the use of luspatercept in paediatric patients.
Risk Groups and Risk Factors
Paediatric patients exposed to luspatercept.
Preventability
The target population is adults, as reflected in the luspatercept SmPC.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
The relevance of the juvenile nonclinical findings in rats to development in paediatric patients is unknown. 
Studies in animals have shown developmental toxicity following luspatercept administration. Based on findings 
in animals, luspatercept may cause developmental toxicities when used off-label in paediatric patients. There are 
no data from the use of luspatercept in paediatric patients.
Public Health Impact
In children with β-thalassaemia, growth and development are retarded. Luspatercept may have a potential impact 
of developmental toxicity in children.

Important Potential Risk: Use During Pregnancy and Lactation
Use During Pregnancy and Lactation
Potential Mechanisms
The exact mechanism of foetal toxicity has not been studied. It is unknown whether luspatercept or its metabolites 
are excreted in human milk.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
Luspatercept is transferred through the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits and is excreted into the milk of 
lactating rats. In a fertility study in rats, administration of luspatercept to females at doses higher than the 
currently recommended highest human dose reduced the average number of implantations and viable embryos. 
No such effects were observed when exposure in animals was at 1.5 times the clinical exposure. Administration 
of luspatercept to male rats at doses higher than the currently recommended highest human dose had no adverse 
effect on male reproductive organs or on their ability to mate and produce viable embryos. The highest dose 
tested in male rats yielded an exposure approximately 7 times the clinical exposure. 
Luspatercept was a selective developmental toxicant (dam not affected; foetus affected) in the rat and a maternal 
and foetal developmental toxicant (doe and foetus affected) in the rabbit. Embryo-foetal effects were seen in both 
species and included reductions in numbers of live foetuses and foetal body weights, increases in resorptions, 
post-implantation loss and skeletal variations, and in rabbit foetuses, malformations of the ribs and vertebrae.
In a peri- and post-natal development study, with dose levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg administered once every 
2 weeks from gestational day 6 through post-natal day 20, adverse findings at all doses consisted of lower F1 pup 
body weights in both sexes at birth, throughout lactation, and post weaning; lower body weights during the early 
premating period (Week 1 and 2) in the F1 females (adverse only at 30 mg/kg/dose) and lower body weights in 
F1 males during the premating, pairing, and post-mating periods; and microscopic kidney findings in F1 pups.
Additionally, no adverse findings included delayed male sexual maturation at 10- and 30 mg/kg/dose. There was 
no effect on behavioural indices, fertility, or reproductive parameters at any dose level in either sex in the F1 
animals.
Characterisation of the Risk 
No cases of pregnancy or lactation have been reported in patients exposed to luspatercept in Studies ACE-536-
MDS-001, ACE-536-B-THAL-001 and ACE-536-B-THAL-002.
Risk Groups and Risk Factors
Pregnant or lactating females exposed to luspatercept.
Preventability
Luspatercept is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception during treatment with luspatercept and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Prior to starting 
treatment with luspatercept, a pregnancy test has to be performed for WCBP. Treatment with luspatercept should 
not be started if the woman is pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant, luspatercept should be discontinued.
Because of the unknown adverse effects of luspatercept in new-borns/infants, a decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding during therapy with luspatercept and for 3 months after the last dose or to discontinue 
luspatercept therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for 
the woman.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
Clinical implications are potentially foetal loss or teratogenicity. Studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity following luspatercept administration. Luspatercept was detected in the milk of lactating rats. Based on 
findings in animals, luspatercept may also compromise female fertility. There are no data from the use of 
luspatercept in pregnant women.

Potential Mechanisms
No mechanism whereby luspatercept may contribute to the risk of bone fractures has been identified for patients 
in the non-transfusion β-thalassaemia populations.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
In Study ACE536-B-THAL-002, traumatic bone fractures were observed in a greater proportion of 
luspatercepttreated patients compared to placebo treated patients with NTD β thalassaemia. 8.3% of 
luspatercept-treated patients reported an event of traumatic fracture. 2.1% of the events were mild and 2.1% of the 
events were moderate in severity. 4 (4.2%) events were Grade 3 (severe) with none being Grade 4 or fatal. 
1 (2.0%) placebo-treated patient reported a Grade 3 (severe) event of traumatic fracture. No Grade 4 or fatal 
events were reported at the data lock point of this submission. In addition, 1 single event of pathologic fracture 
(1.0%) in a luspatercept -treated subject and none on placebo was reported in the study. The pathologic fracture 
was non-serious Grade 1 and involved a subject who also reported a traumatic fracture. No other type of fracture
or specific fracture location was reported in the study.
The addition of traumatic bone fracture as an ADR to the SmPC is based on the numerical imbalance favoring the 
placebo arm.

Risk Groups and Risk Factors
Vogiatzi et al.82 estimated the prevalence of fractures in a sample of North American patients with β-thalassemia. 
Age was a significant independent predictor of fracture history in a model that only included age, diagnosis, 
gender and race. Fracture prevalence was higher among older subjects (odds ratio for a 5-year increase 1.45, 95% 
CI 1.30 to 1.62, P<0.001). Age distribution in the β-thalassemia intermedia group was reported as follows: 0.0% 
in the 0-11 age group, 6.7% in the 11-20 age group and 22.9% in 20+ age group. Other risk factors included, 
lower lumbar bone mass, decreased lower bone mineral density, and hypogonadism.
Another risk factor for bone fracture is type of thalassemia. A systematic review and meta-analysis by 
Charoenngam et al.83 that included 25 studies with 4934 patients showed that the pooled prevalence of fracture 
was 18% (95%CI, 16-19%; I2 = 89.0%) among patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, and 7% (95%CI, 
4-10%; I2 = 94.2%) among patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This risk may relate to the fact 
that patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia have lower bone mineral density than NTD thalassemia and 
may experience lifelong fracture rates as high as 71%. The pathogenesis of thalassemia-associated osteoporosis 
(TAO) is multifactorial with anemia and iron overload playing crucial role in its development.
Results for bone loss in the NTD population vary in the literature by type of NTD β-Thalassemia. A study by 
Nakavachara et al. 2018 determined that the prevalence of low bone mass among adolescents with NTD Hb E/β-
Thalassemia was relatively low (1.7-10.2%).84 In the study by Vogiatzi, fracture prevalence, regardless of 
thalassemia type, increased with age and among patients who have lower lumbar bone mass. The average BMD Z 
and T scores were 0.85 SD lower among patients with a history of fractures (mean Z/T score −2.78 vs. −1.93, 
95% CI for the difference −0.49 to −1.22 SD, P = 0.02) implying that fractures in thalassemia are primarily the 
result of decreased bone mass.82
Preventability
Due to the potential risk of traumatic fractures in patients with β-thalassaemia, it is prudent to inform treating 
physicians about this risk, so they can work with patients to address modifiable risk factors in a population that is 
prone to sustain fractures. 
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
There is a higher incidence of traumatic fractures reported in the luspatercept treatment group than in the placebo 
treatment group in the NTDT pivotal ACE-536-B-THAL-002 study. Most of these traumatic fractures were due 
to accidental falls with no further circumstances reported, none of these were reported as spontaneous fractures, 
and most subjects had underlying osteoporosis or osteopenia. All luspatercept subjects who reported traumatic 
fractures had stable T-scores from baseline until the time of the fracture. All TEAEs of traumatic fractures were 
considered by the investigator as not related to study treatment and due to other causes. However, given the 
numerical imbalance favoring placebo, traumatic fracture was added as an adverse drug reaction to the SmPC. 
For patients treated with and who are responsive to luspatercept, clinical benefit will manifest through reduction 
in cumulative transfusion burden over time. Given the lifelong chronic anemia, its significant impact on 
morbidity and mortality, and lack of treatment options available for NTD β-thalassemia patients, the MAH 
believes luspatercept offers an important and much-needed treatment option for patients in this indication and the 
risk of traumatic fractures can be effectively mitigated by routine pharmacovigilance
Public Health Impact
Fractures have important functional consequences and reductions in quality of life. The economic impact of 
fractures may result in temporary disability and significant health care resources are required for diagnosis and 
treatment most fractures.
Overall, patients with β-thalassemia are known to be at higher risk of bone loss which can lead to fractures though 
no studies have been conducted that compare bone loss or fracture risk in the NTD β-thalassemia population 
compared to the general population.

Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Routine Pharmacovigilance activities in BMS as described in the BMS Pharmacovigilance System 
Master  File  and  Drug  Safety’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  are  in  accordance  with  “Good 
Pharmacovigilance Practices in the European Union.” BMS’s Routine Pharmacovigilance System 
is detailed in the current version of the BMS Pharmacovigilance System Master File.
In  addition  to  expedited  reporting,  BMS diligently  undertakes  follow-up  on  all  AEs,  including 
serious AEs that are provided to health authorities to ensure that all details of the case are captured 
for  optimal  clinical  evaluation.  This  includes  efforts  to  obtain  all  relevant  information  and  to 
establish the final outcome of the AEs.
Emerging  potential  safety  signals  can  be  detected  by  periodic  and  if  appropriate,  cumulative 
evaluation of the AEs. The results will be compiled in the periodic safety update report (PSUR), 
in accordance with Guidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices in the EU/EEA. Periodicity 
of  the  PSUR  submissions  is  defined  by  the  date of  the  first  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
approval/international birth date of 08-Nov-2019.
In  addition,  data  regarding  the  important  identified  and  potential  risks  will  be  presented  in  the 
PSUR. The data presentation will include all case reports collected during the period covered by 
the PSUR together with cumulative data.
Using the data obtained from this plan, the risk-benefit profile of luspatercept will be re-evaluated

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

Summary of risk management plan for REBLOZYL (luspatercept)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  REBLOZYL.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of REBLOZYL, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about REBLOZYL’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
REBLOZYL’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how REBLOZYL should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for REBLOZYL should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
REBLOZYL’s RMP.
I.  The medicine and what it is used for
REBLOZYL is  authorised  for the treatment  of  transfusion-dependent  (TD)  anaemia  in  patients 
with  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in adults for the treatment of anaemia associated with 
TD and non-transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
luspatercept as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of REBLOZYL’s benefits can be found in REBLOZYL’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines  Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of REBLOZYL, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about REBLOZYL’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including periodic safety update report assessment so that immediate action can 
be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of REBLOZYL is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of REBLOZYL are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of REBLOZYL.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for 
which an association with the use of this  medicine  is possible  based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to  information  on the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).
Important identified and potential risks, together with missing information, are summarised in the 
table below.

groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
There is a known risk of TEEs in patients with splenectomy. In Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-001, embolic and thrombotic events and thrombophlebitis were observed in a 
greater proportion of luspatercept-treated patients (4.0%) compared to placebo-treated 
patients (0.9%) with TD β-thalassaemia. Device occlusion does not clinically qualify as 
a TEE. Excluding the device occlusion, there were 8 TD β-thalassaemia patients (3.6%) 
in the luspatercept treatment group who reported TEE events. All cases of TEEs were 
consistent with the literature and reported in patients who have had a splenectomy and 
who had at least 1 other risk factor for developing a TEE (including history of 
thrombocytosis or hormone replacement therapy). The occurrence of TEEs was not 
correlated with elevated haemoglobin levels. No patient had concurrent hypertension at 
the time of the TEE.
TEEs are common complications of thalassaemia, especially thalassaemia intermedia. 
The increased risk of TEEs is likely due to abnormalities in platelet, red blood cell, 
endothelial cell, and thrombin activation which all contribute to hypercoagulable state.
In addition to these haematological abnormalities, splenectomy has also been shown to 
be a major risk factor contributing to hypercoagulability among patients with 
thalassaemia.
Additional risk factors for TEEs in β-thalassaemia include age, iron overload, 
thrombocytosis, hormone replacement therapy, cardiac and endocrine disease, all 
common in this patient population. Furthermore, patients may also be at risk of TEEs 
due to other conventional risk factors similar to the nonthalassaemia population.
Routine risk minimisation measures:
SmPC Section 4.8 – TEEs (including deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, 
ischaemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism) are included as undesirable effects in 
patients with TD β-thalassaemia.
PL Section 4 – Stroke symptoms and blood clots in the veins are included as possible 
side effects.

(10/315) of patients treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study and in the long-term 
follow-up study (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001/ACE-536-LTFU-001). Spinal cord 
compression symptoms due to EMH masses occurred in 1.9% (6/315) of patients 
treated with luspatercept. 
In non transfusion dependent thalassaemia patients, EMH masses were observed in 
6.3% (6/96) of patients treated with luspatercept in the pivotal study. Spinal cord 
compression due to EMH masses occurred in 1.0% (1/96) of patients treated with 
luspatercept. During the open-label portion of the study, EMH masses were observed in 
2 additional patients for a total of 8/134 (6.0%) of patients.
Extramedullary haemopoiesis is among the 3 most common complications, and 
prevalence of EMH masses has been reported as approximately 20% to 25%. Among 
patients with no previous transfusions, approximately 60.0% have disease-related 
complications of extramedullary haemopoiesis, whereas among patients with regular 
transfusions (TD β-thalassaemia), approximately 4.0% have disease-related 
complications of extramedullary haemopoiesis. Extramedullary haemopoiesis is a 
complication due to ineffective erythropoiesis or inadequate bone marrow function and 
is seen to occur in patients with β-thalassaemia and other chronic hematologic 
disorders. In patients with such disorders, the ineffective erythropoiesis or inadequate 
bone marrow function can potentially precipitate extra marrow production of blood 
elements (ie, extramedullary haemopoiesis). Expansion of the erythron in the bone 
marrow in non-TD β-thalassaemia during ineffective erythropoiesis is associated with 
homing and proliferation of erythroid precursors in the spleen and liver as a physiologic 
compensatory phenomenon, which leads to hepatosplenomegaly. Ineffective

erythropoiesis in non-TD β-thalassaemia patients also forces expansion of the 
hematopoietic tissue in areas other than the liver and spleen, mostly in the form of 
masses termed extramedullary hematopoietic pseudotumours. 
Risk factors associated with β-thalassaemia EMH include: males, splenectomy, IVS-I-6 
either in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity, higher levels of GDF15 and 
erythropoietin, and fewer red blood cell transfusions.
Chronic anaemia has been shown to lead to increased levels of erythropoietin and 
overstimulation of early stage erythropoiesis. For patients with thalassaemia, this may 
result in EMH, primarily in the spleen.

growth of EMH masses.
SmPC Section 4.8 – EMH masses is included as an undesirable effect in patients.

Luspatercept is contraindicated in patients requiring treatment to control the growth of 
EMH masses. Patients with EMH masses may experience worsening of these masses 
and complications during treatment. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on 
anatomical location. Patients should be monitored at initiation and during treatment for 
symptoms and signs or complications resulting from the EMH masses, and be treated 
according to clinical guidelines. Treatment with luspatercept must be discontinued in 
case of serious complications due to EMH masses.

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
In a toxicity study conducted in juvenile rats, 3 of the 44 rats examined in the highest 
dose group (10 mg/kg) had haematologic malignancies (one incidence each of 
lymphoma, myeloid leukaemia, and lymphoid leukaemia) were reported. In 
Study ACE-536-MDS-001, haematologic malignancies (preferred terms of 
transformation to AML only) were observed in 2.0% of luspatercept-treated MDS 
patients; the follow-up-adjusted incidence rate was 1.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 5.22 per 
100,000 person-years). There was no observed incremental risk associated with 
luspatercept administration for haematologic malignancies. 
No haematologic malignancies have been observed with luspatercept in the TD and 
non-TD β-thalassaemia population as of the data lock point of this submission. One 
event of erythroleukaemia (AML M6) was reported in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 in 
Nov 2018. An independent expert haematopathologist concluded that a diagnosis of 
AML M6 in this patient was very unlikely. The independent data monitoring committee 
considered the clinical course to be consistent with β-thalassaemia major complicated 
by splenomegaly, neutropenia, and sepsis, possibly triggered by deferiprone therapy. 
The patient subsequently died.
Available clinical data do not suggest a relationship of transformation/development of 
higher risk MDS/AML with luspatercept treatment.

Risk minimisation 
measures
Progression to AML is well known as part of the progression of the disease (up to 25% 
of patients) and is associated with baseline factors.
Steensma et al. studied risk stratification according to the International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPSS) in 816 patients and found a time to 25% leukaemia progression 
being 9.4 years for IPSS low-risk, 3.3 years for IPSS intermediate-1-risk, 1.1 years for 
IPSS intermediate-2 risk, and 0.2 years for IPSS high risk. Thus, assuming a linear 
progression, the 1-year risk of AML in MDS is approximately 2.6% (IPSS low-risk) to 
7.6% (IPSS intermediate-1-risk).
Using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, Malcovati assessed 
the role of the main prognostic factors for progression to leukaemia and overall survival 
(OS) in 476 patients first diagnosed with de novo MDS in Italy between 1992 and 2002. 
Malcovati reported a negative effect of developing a transfusion requirement on OS in 
patients with refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts or MDS with 
del(5q) (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.46). 
In a further development of the WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System 
a learning cohort of 426 Italian MDS patients and a validation cohort of 193 evaluable 
German MDS patients was reported by Malcovati. In a multivariable analysis of the 
Italian patients stratified by WHO subgroups, cytogenetics and transfusion requirement 
significantly affected OS (HR = 1.48 and HR = 2.53, respectively) and risk of AML 
(HR = 1.3 and HR = 2.4, respectively). In a multivariable analysis of the German MDS 
patients stratified by WHO subgroups, cytogenetics and transfusion dependency 
retained a significant effect on both OS (HR = 1.84 and HR = 1.85, respectively) and 
risk of AML (HR = 2.27 and HR = 2.25, respectively).
Mallo reported the results of a cooperative study designed to assess prognostic factors 
for OS and progression to AML in 541 patients with de novo MDS and del 5q. In 
multivariate analyses the most important predictors of both OS and AML progression 
were number of chromosomal abnormalities (p < 0.001 for both outcomes), platelet 
count (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and proportion of bone marrow blasts 
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Transfusion burden was not addressed in this 
study.
In a multicentre study conducted in Iran between 2002 and 2007, haematologic 
malignancy in patients with β-thalassaemia was evaluated. The proportion of patients 
with cancer was higher in those with β-thalassaemia intermedia compared with β-
thalassaemia major. Cancer was diagnosed in patients aged 0 to 39 years, but not in any 
of the older patients.

In a study in juvenile rats, luspatercept was administered from postnatal day 7 to 91 at 
0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. Luspatercept-related findings unique to juvenile rats included 
tubular atrophy/hypoplasia of the kidney inner medulla, delays in the mean age of 
sexual maturation in males, effects on reproductive performance (lower mating indices), 
and nonadverse decreases in bone mineral density in both male and female rats. The 
effects on reproductive performance were observed after a greater than 3-month 
recovery period, suggesting a permanent effect. Although reversibility of the tubular 
atrophy/hypoplasia was not examined, these effects are also considered to be 
irreversible. Adverse effects on the kidney and reproductive system were observed at 
clinically relevant exposure levels and seen at the lowest dose tested and, thus, a no 
observed adverse effect level was not established. In addition, haematological 
malignancies were observed in 3 out of 44 rats examined in the highest dose group 
(10 mg/kg). These findings are all considered to be potential risks in paediatric patients.

Luspatercept is transferred through the placenta of pregnant rats and rabbits and is 
excreted into the milk of lactating rats. In a fertility study in rats, administration of 
luspatercept to females at doses higher than the currently recommended highest human 
dose reduced the average number of implantations and viable embryos. No such effects 
were observed when exposure in animals was at 1.5 times the clinical exposure. 
Administration of luspatercept to male rats at doses higher than the currently 
recommended highest human dose had no adverse effect on male reproductive organs 
or on their ability to mate and produce viable embryos. The highest dose tested in male 
rats yielded an exposure approximately 7 times the clinical exposure. 
Luspatercept was a selective developmental toxicant (dam not affected; foetus affected) 
in the rat and a maternal and foetal developmental toxicant (doe and foetus affected) in 
the rabbit. Embryo-foetal effects were seen in both species and included reductions in 
numbers of live foetuses and foetal body weights, increases in resorptions, 
post-implantation loss and skeletal variations, and in rabbit foetuses, malformations of 
the ribs and vertebrae.
In a peri- and post-natal development study, with dose levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg 
administered once every 2 weeks from gestational day 6 through post-natal day 20, 
adverse findings at all doses consisted of lower first filial generation (F1) pup body 
weights in both sexes at birth, throughout lactation, and post weaning; lower body 
weights during the early premating period (Week 1 and 2) in the F1 females (adverse 
only at 30 mg/kg/dose) and lower body weights in F1 males during the premating, 
pairing, and post-mating periods; and microscopic kidney findings in F1 pups. 
Additionally, no adverse findings included delayed male sexual maturation at 10- and 
30 mg/kg/dose. There was no effect on behavioural indices, fertility, or reproductive 
parameters at any dose level in either sex in the F1 animals.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
In Study ACE536-B-THAL-002, traumatic bone fractures were observed in a greater 
proportion of luspatercepttreated patients compared to placebo treated patients with 
NTD β thalassaemia. 8.3% of luspatercept-treated patients reported an event of 
traumatic fracture. 2.1% of the events were mild and 2.1% of the events were moderate 
in severity. 4 (4.2%) events were Grade 3 (severe) with none being Grade 4 or fatal. 
1 (2.0%) placebo-treated patient reported a Grade 3 (severe) event of traumatic fracture. 
No Grade 4 or fatal events were reported at the data lock point of this submission. In 
addition, 1 single event of pathologic fracture (1.0%) in a luspatercept -treated subject 
and none on placebo was reported in the study. The pathologic fracture was non-serious 
Grade 1 and involved a subject who also reported a traumatic fracture. No other type of 
fracture or specific fracture location was reported in the study.
The addition of traumatic bone fracture and an ADR to the SmPC is based on the 
numerical imbalance favoring the placebo arm.
Vogiatzi et al. estimated the prevalence of fractures in a sample of North American 
patients with β-thalassemia. Age was a significant independent predictor of fracture 
history in a model that only included age, diagnosis, gender and race. Fracture 
prevalence was higher among older subjects (odds ratio for a 5-year increase 1.45, 95% 
CI 1.30 to 1.62, P<0.001). Age distribution in the β-thalassemia intermedia group was 
reported as follows: 0.0% in the 0-11 age group, 6.7% in the 11-20 age group and 
22.9% in 20+ age group. Other risk factors included, lower lumbar bone mass, 
decreased lower bone mineral density, and hypogonadism.
Another risk factor for bone fracture is type of thalassemia. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis by Charoenngam et al. that included 25 studies with 4934 patients 
showed that the pooled prevalence of fracture was 18% (95%CI, 16-19%; I2 = 89.0%) 
among patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, and 7% (95%CI, 4-10%; I2 = 
94.2%) among patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This risk may 
relate to the fact that patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia have lower bone 
mineral density than NTD thalassemia and may experience lifelong fracture rates as 
high as 71%. The pathogenesis of thalassemia-associated osteoporosis (TAO) is 
multifactorial with anemia and iron overload playing crucial role in its development.
Results for bone loss in the NTD population vary in the literature by type of NTD β-
Thalassemia. A study by Nakavachara et al. 2018 determined that the prevalence of low 
bone mass among adolescents with NTD Hb E/β-Thalassemia was relatively low (1.7-
10.2%). In the study by Vogiatzi, fracture prevalence, regardless of thalassemia type, 
increased with age and among patients who have lower lumbar bone mass. The average 
BMD Z and T scores were 0.85 SD lower among patients with a history of fractures 
(mean Z/T score −2.78 vs. −1.93, 95% CI for the difference −0.49 to −1.22 SD, P = 
0.02) implying that fractures in thalassemia are primarily the result of decreased bone 
mass.

ANNEX 6: DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES
Prior  to  the  launch  of  luspatercept in  each  Member  State,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder 
(MAH)  must  agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  programme,  including 
communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
NCA.
The MAH shall ensure that in each member state where luspatercept is marketed, all HCPs who 
intend  to  prescribe  luspatercept  are  provided  with  an  HCP  Information  Pack,  containing  the 
following:
1.
2.
3.
Information on where to find latest SmPC;
HCP Checklist;
Patient Card (for WCBP only).
Healthcare Professional Checklist
The HCP Checklist is to be used before initiating treatment, at each administration, and then at 
regular intervals when performing follow-up. 
The HCP Checklist shall contain the following key messages:

Information  on  studies  in  animals  showing  luspatercept  reproductive  and  embryo-foetal 
toxicity and is therefore contraindicated during pregnancy.
 Reminder  that  luspatercept  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  WCBP  not  using 
effective contraception.
 Need to provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding the 
potential teratogenic risk of luspatercept and required actions to minimise this risk.
 A  pregnancy  test  must  be  carried  out  and  negative  results  verified  by  the  prescriber  before 
starting treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals.
 Patients must use highly effective contraception during the treatment with luspatercept.
 While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant or wants 
to  become  pregnant,  luspatercept  should  be  discontinued.  Women  of  childbearing  potential 
must use highly effective contraception during treatment with luspatercept and for at least 3 
months following discontinuation of treatment with luspatercept.
 Need to provide counselling in the event of pregnancy and evaluation of the outcome of any 
pregnancy.
 Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 3 months following discontinuation of 
treatment with  luspatercept, remind the patient that it should be reported to the HCP, NCA, 
and/or to Celgene by contacting the local e-mail address or visiting the URL provided in the 
material, irrespective of adverse outcomes observed.

Patient Card (for WCBP only)
Version 3.2
luspatercept
The Patient Card is to be handed to WCBP by the HCP at the time of treatment initiation. The 
HCP  is  to  request  that  the  WCBP  confirm  whether  they  have  the  Patient  Card  prior  to  each 
subsequent administration and provide them with additional cards as needed. 
The Patient Card shall contain the following key messages:

Instructions to the WCBP on:
 The need for a negative pregnancy test result prior to starting treatment with luspatercept 
in WCBP.
 The need  for WCBP to use at least one highly effective  method of contraception during 
treatment with luspatercept and for at least 3 months following discontinuation.
 The need to report to the doctor any suspected or confirmed pregnancy occurring during 
and for 3 months following discontinuation of treatment.

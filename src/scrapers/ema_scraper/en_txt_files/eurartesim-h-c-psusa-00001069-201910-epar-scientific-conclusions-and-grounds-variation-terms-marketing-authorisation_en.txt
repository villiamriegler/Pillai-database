Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for artenimol / piperaquine 
tetraphosphate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on evidence from literature as regards the significant increase of resistance against artemisinins 
and/or piperaquine based therapies in Plasmodium falciparum, the PRAC considered that  a change in 
the product information of products containing artenimol/piperaquine to  adequately reflect this  risk, 
taking into account recent findings in terms of frequencies which might  change the benefit of 
Eurartesim in certain regions, is needed.  
Furthermore, the PRAC considered based on a literature article that  an update of section 4.5 of the 
SmPC with  the drug-drug interaction between efavirenz and artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate 
was warranted. In addition,  this section was further updated to reflect currently authorised 
antiretroviral medicines. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for artenimol /  piperaquine tetraphosphate the CHMP  is of the 
opinion that  the benefit-risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  artenimol / piperaquine 
tetraphosphate is unchanged subject to  the proposed changes to the  product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited submitted on 3 November 2017 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Delstrigo, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 February 2017.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Doravirine/Lamivudine/Tenofovir Disoproxil (as fumarate) MSD is indicated for the treatment of adults 
infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of viral resistance to doravirine, lamivudine, or 
tenofovir. 
During the evaluation phase, the applicant was changed from Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited (Hertford 
Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire EN11 9BU, United Kingdom) to Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. (Waarderweg 
39, Haarlem, 2031 BN, The Netherlands).  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0116/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0116/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance doravirine contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the resulting Acquired Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) are having a significant human and socio-economic impact.  
WHO reported that around 37 million people around the world were living with HIV-1 infection in 2016, 
with around 2 million newly infected in that year, and an estimated 1 million deaths.  The majority of new 
infections and deaths (64% and 73%) occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.  Approximately 2.1 million adults 
and children were living with HIV infection in western and central Europe and North America, where 
73,000 were estimated to have been infected that year. 
A large number of antiretrovirals are available, as part of 6 different drug classes: nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease 
inhibitors (PIs), integrase inhibitors (INIs), fusion inhibitors (i.e. enfuvirtide) and CCR5 inhibitors (i.e. 
maraviroc). 
Present treatment guidelines recommend 2 NRTIs in combination with an NNRTI, a PI (in combination 
with a pharmacokinetic enhancer) or an INI. Doravirine belongs to the NNRTI class. This class has been 
downgraded to be “an alternative regimen” by some treatment guidelines (including the European EACS 
guideline) for reasons of a tolerability (efavirenz associated with CNS side effects , nevirapine with liver 
reactions and rash) and efficacy (rilpivirine, which is not indicated for patients with a high baseline viral 
load, and where commonly used proton pump inhibitors are contra-indicated as co-medication). The third 
available NNRTI, etravirine, is indicated as a second line agent (previously treated), and needs to be 
taken twice daily.  
Globally, NNRTI-based regimens has prevailed, and been recommended as first line by the WHO, since 
the start of the ”roll-out” of HIV therapy in low and middle income countries, which started around 2004. 
This is because such regimens have been available at low costs, and until recently the only regimens that 
were available as fixed dose products, a quality considered of high importance in such settings.  Alarming 
figures on an increasing prevalence of NNRTI resistance, with figures >10% in those newly diagnosed 
with HIV-infection, are reported from some regions (WHO HIV Drug Resistance Report 2017). As long as 
an NNRTI regimen is taken with adequate compliance, the efficacy is as high as with other regimens. 
However, the regimens used so far cannot be considered to have a “high resistance barrier”, and are 
prone for resistance development in case therapy is stopped for a prolonged time as a consequence of the 
very long half-life of the present agents  (i.e. resulting in functional monotherapy  for a couple of weeks 
if therapy is halted). Consequently, the WHO is now introducing dolutegravir, a second generation INI 
with a high resistance barrier, as the basis for an alternative first line regimen. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 8/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hence, there is room for improvement within the NNRTI class, both with regards to efficacy and safety 
aspects. Doravirine has been developed with the aim to address the potential short comings of available 
NNRTIs. 
2.2.  About the product 
Doravirine is a new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Mutations selected in vitro, 
and in a limited number of failing subjects in vivo, are partially the same, and partially different from 
those seen at failure with the other agents of the class. The reduction in in vitro susceptibility is not very 
pronounced in the presence of the most prevalent NNRTI mutations seen at failure with the available 
agents (included transmitted resistance typically seen in lower income settings). However, the efficacy of 
doravirine has only been evaluated in patients without prior therapy, and in the absence of NNRTI 
resistance, since full set of such mutations (as listed by IAS-USA) were part of exclusion criteria in the 
clinical trials. Consequently, no threshold for defining phenotypic resistance to DOR has yet been clinically 
defined.  
Doravirine has a low protein binding (around 75%) in comparison to available NNRTIs (>99%). The free 
Cmin concentration with the chosen dose of 100 mg qd covers the EC95 of wild type virus several fold, 
and also the EC95 of virus harbouring the most prevalent NNRTI mutations typically seen at failure with 
efavirenz. For reasons mentioned, it remains to be studied whether such resistance is devoid of a negative 
impact on efficacy in clinical practice. 
The food impact on absorption is moderate, and not considered clinically relevant; doravirine was given 
without regards to food in the phase 3 studies. On the basis of studies in HIV-negative subjects, 
doravirine can be given without dose adjustment to patients with renal impairment (including severe) as 
well as to patients with hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B studied, Child Pugh C not studied).  The terminal 
half-life of around 15 hrs is considerably shorter than that of efavirenz and rilpivirine (around 40-45 hrs). 
This may reduce the risk of resistance development in case of halted therapy, a problem often discussed 
for the NNRTI class. 
The current application concerns the use of doravirine, combined with tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine 
in standard doses, as a fixed dose combination product. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
• 
Legal basis 
This application is submitted in accordance with article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, with claim for a new 
active substance.  
•  Accelerated procedure 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This is because doravirine belongs to an established class 
of antiretrovirals (NNRTI), is not indicated for rescue therapy (resistance profile is not clinically 
evaluated), and there is a large number of available antiretrovirals with favourable efficacy and safety 
profiles. 
•  Conditional approval - NA 
• 
Exceptional circumstances - NA 
•  Biosimilar application - NA 
•  1 year data exclusivity - NA 
Delstrigo public assessment report

•  Significance of paediatric studies 
A Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) has been agreed on 28/04/2017 (PIP decision number 
P/0116/2017). No paediatric data has been provided as part of the application, where the indication 
concerns adult use. 
•  Clinical development programme  
The clinical development programme of doravirine is considered to be in compliance with the CHMP 
guidance.  
Short-term monotherapy was undertaken with a low (25 mg qd) and a high dose (200 mg qd), and the 
following dose response combination therapy with four dose levels in the same span, using efavirenz as 
control agent. The phase 3 studies were blinded and used adequate control agents (darunavir/r and 
efavirenz). In a previous CHMP advice, it was clearly stated that the primary endpoint should concern <40 
copies/ml using the FDA snap shot approach. The <50 copies/ml cut off was still used as primary 
endpoint; however, outcomes with the lower cut-off are presented, and regardless of what level is used 
point estimates favour doravirine over control. It was also clearly stated that safety endpoints (comparing 
frequency of side effects that are common during therapy with the agents chosen for control) are not to 
be part of the SmPC.  
All studies concerned are stated to have been performed in compliance with GCP. Routine inspections, 
with satisfactory outcomes, were carried out at two sites, one in the US and one in Chile.

Doravirine 
General information 
The chemical name of doravirine is 3-chloro-5-({1-[(4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H 
-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl]-2-oxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl}oxy)benzonitrile 
corresponding to the molecular formula C17H11ClF3N5O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 425.75 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of doravirine was elucidated by a combination of UV, IR, NMR-1H and 13C, and MS. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by DSC, TGA, and XRPD.  
Doravirine is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder which is practically insoluble in 
water. 
Doravirine has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has been observed for doravirine.  
Doravirine is considered a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class II compound (i.e., low 
solubility and high permeability at a human dose of 100 mg). 
Doravirine is a New Active Substance (NAS). Evaluation of the structure of doravirine active substance 
proved that there is no metabolite of doravirine formed in vitro or in vivo which is a chemical active 
substance previously authorized as a medicinal product in the European Union. Also, there is no evidence 
that doravirine is either an ether or ester analog, derivative, different salt form, polymorph, co-crystal of 
an authorized active substance. Additionally, doravirine is not a mixture of isomers related to an existing 
active substance, or a single isomer of an existing active substance containing a mixture of isomers. 
Doravirine is entirely composed of covalent bonds and none of its bonds are ionic or associated with 
counter-ions. Therefore, by definition, doravirine is not a salt. 
Similarly, the applicant provided data to demonstrate that doravirine or any sub-structure of doravirine  is 
not the therapeutic moiety of an already authorised active substance. 
The body of information provided demonstrates that doravirine active substance meets the criteria 
presented in the Reflection Paper on the chemical structure and properties criteria to be considered for 
the evaluation of new active substance status of chemical substances and therefore qualifies as a NAS. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Doravirine is synthesized using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 11/125 
 
 
 
The synthetic route has been demonstrated at multiple scales, from laboratory to commercial, within the 
ranges specified and has been shown to produce doravirine active substance meeting all in-process and 
release specifications. 
The selection of regulatory starting materials was discussed in connection with a CHMP Scientific Advice 
received in 2016. The definition of starting materials is considered justified and acceptable. The control of 
raw materials including the starting materials is sufficient. 
The in-process controls and the critical process parameter have been acceptably described and are 
considered adequate.  
The control of the isolated intermediates is satisfactory. 
The extensive development of the synthesis process has been described in detail. Elements of Q8-Q11 
have been used but the control strategy is claimed to be traditional. The applicant does not propose 
design spaces, however, proven acceptable ranges are claimed. Based on these studies, proven 
acceptable ranges have been defined for all the described steps of the manufacturing process of the active 
substance. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed proven acceptable range (PAR)s. 
Summary descriptions of the developmental studies performed have been provided. They included one 
factor at a time (OFAT) and multiple factor at a time (MFAT) experiments. Part of the first synthesis step 
uses a continuous flow reactor and this has been described in sufficient detail.     
The active substance doravirine and intermediates have been characterised using adequate analytical 
techniques. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Extensive information and discussions regarding potential impurities including potentially mutagenic 
impurities and non-mutagenic carcinogenic impurities and the control strategies of the same have been 
provided. The mutagenic impurities emerging from the starting materials, intermediates and active 
substances have been identified. However, in this procedure, the CHMP has concluded that the 
classification of HIV in the ICH M7 document is no longer supported due to the anticipated duration of 
therapy in HIV, which may well be more than 5-10 years. Therefore, the CHMP considers that mutagenic 
impurities must be limited to 1.5 µg/day limit, rather than 10 µg/day proposed by the applicant.  
Doravirine container closure system used for its long-term storage is a double, low density polyethylene 
(LDPE) liner in an outer containment of a fibreboard drum or HDPE drum or packaging providing 
equivalent or enhanced protection from light. The LDPE materials comply with European Pharmacopoeia 
3.1.3, EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), and water content (KF). 
The proposed doravirine active substance specifications are acceptable.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from several manufacturing scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA).  
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 12/125 
 
 
The specifications for doravirine active substance were established after review of the analytical method 
capabilities, a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the process and finished product CQAs, as 
well as an extensive review of the batch and stability data. The release specifications are also used 
through re-test. Batch release data for lots used in toxicological and safety assessment studies, clinical 
trials, and production scale manufacturing were included in the review. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in in double LDPE liners within a fiberboard container for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The results for three additional primary commercial 
stability batches for 12 months at 25°C/60%RH and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH showed comparable 
results to prior stability studies. 
Stability testing on doravirine active substance at each time point included description, assay and 
impurities by HPLC, and water content by KF titration. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No notable trends were observed at any of the 
stability conditions.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed.  
Results upon exposure to stress conditions (thermal, oxidative, and photolytic stresses, acidic and basic 
conditions) were examined. These stress studies were intended to generate degradation products in order 
to demonstrate the selectivity and stability-indicating nature of the HPLC methods.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed containers.

Lamivudine is a white or almost white powder. It is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol, slightly 
soluble in ethanol. Three relevant crystalline forms of lamivudine had been identified (Form I, Form II and 
Form III). Form II, anhydrous, is the most stable form, was used to manufacture the finished product. The 
kinetic solubility of lamivudine Form II in water is 98 mg/mL at 25°C and is considered a BCS class III 
compound. 
Lamivudine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
As indicated in the CEP, lamivudine is packaged in double polyethylene bags (outer black) placed in a 
polyethylene drum. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure 
Acceptable  information  relating  to  the  specification  and  controls  applied  by  the  finished  product 
manufacturer for their control of the active substance lamivudine has been submitted. The control tests 
were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph.  
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, solubility (Ph.Eur.), identity (IR, HPLC, 
chiral HPLC, DSC, UV), impurities (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) 
Stability 
No retest period is stated on the CEP, and the applicant has provided stability data for three validation 
batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored at long term conditions (25°C/60% 
RH) for 24 months and accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) for 6 months according to the ICH 
guidelines. The batches were stored in in the intended commercial package double polyethylene (PE) 
bags, placed inside HDPE drum.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, DSC), water content (KF), 
enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC). At both storage conditions 
no out of specification results and no trends are observed for any of the parameters tested.  
Based on the stability data provided, the retest period and the storage conditions proposed by the 
applicant are acceptable. 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is 
[[(2R)-1-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]oxymethyl-(propan-2-yloxycarbonyloxymethoxy)phosphoryl]
oxymethyl propan-2-yl carbonate;(E)-but-2-enedioic acid corresponding to the molecular formula 
C19H30N5O10P·C4H4O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 635.51 g/mol and the following structure:

Figure 3: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was elucidated by a combination of 1H-NMR, 
13C-NMR, MS, IR, UV and HPLC. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by 
XRPD. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a white to off-white slightly hygroscopic powder. It is slightly soluble in 
water and sparingly soluble in pH buffers 2.0-8.0. 
Tenofovir disoproxil exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Enantiomeric 
purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exists 
in two polymorphic forms with indistinguishable solubility. Therefore, any solid-state differences are 
unlikely to result in clinical consequences. The manufacturing process of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
proposed in the present application, consistently produces one polymorph.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is synthesized using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls (IPC) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. An evaluation 
of potentially mutagenic impurities has been performed. However, in this procedure, the CHMP has 
concluded that the classification of HIV in the ICH M7 guideline is no longer supported and considers that 
a limit of 1.5 µg/day has to be applied for mutagenic impurities, rather than 10 µg/day. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for commercial dispatch is packed in a primary transparent low density 
polyethylene bag (LDPE), followed by another transparent LDPE bag. The secondary pack is a triple 
laminated sunlight barrier bag (TLSB) with heat sealed kept in a HDPE drum. The packaging material 
complies with the EC Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011, European Pharmacopeia 3.1.3. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (ICP-MS), and residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.)

There is a monograph for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the International Pharmacopoeia (WHO) from 
June 2010 and there is an authorized USP monograph.   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of several commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in similar packages to the commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (5 
± 3°C) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (25 ± 2° C /60 ± 5% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested were the same as for release except for melting range, residue on ignition, fumaric 
acid and residual solvents by GC. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the retest period and the storage conditions in the proposed 
container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The product is a yellow, oval-shaped, bilayer film-coated tablet, debossed with the corporate logo and 
776 on one side and plain on the other side. Each tablet is 21.59 mm long by 11.30 mm wide. 30 tablets 
will be packaged into HDPE bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant closure and silica gel desiccant. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The primary strategy of the tablet development program was aimed at developing a solid oral dosage 
form that meets the quality target product profile (QTPP) throughout the product’s shelf life. The safety, 
efficacy, and patient compliance considerations were used to guide decisions about the dosage form and 
packaging choices. The finished product has been developed as a solid immediate release oral dosage 
form. The daily single tablet would be suitable for global market with a shelf life of at least 2 years 
amongst other relevant requirements. Other safety and efficacy considerations included the control of 
impurities and degradation products and suitable pharmacokinetic performance for all the actives 
substances as single entities. 
During formulation development, selected target product profile categories were translated into product 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) used to aid in risk assessments made during development.   
The key physical properties of the active substances have been described and considered as part of the 
development program: 
• 
Doravirine  
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 16/125 
 
 
 
Doravirine is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder which is practically insoluble in 
water. 
Polymorphism: As mentioned above, polymorphism has been observed for doravirine. Aqueous solubility: 
It is classified as a BCS class II compound. 
• 
Lamivudine 
Polymorphism: Lamivudine exhibits polymorphism but a single polymorph was selected for development. 
Aqueous solubility: Lamivudine is considered a BCS class III compound. 
Stability: Lamivudine is chemically and physically stable when stored at room temperature. 
• 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
Polymorphism: The active substance manufacturing process is controlled to produce a single tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate polymorph. 
Aqueous solubility: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is considered a BCS class III compound. 
Hygroscopicity: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is slightly hygroscopic. 
Stress stability: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is sensitive to temperature and moisture, and can undergo 
hydrolysis in solution as well as in the solid state. The main hydrolysis degradation product, the tenofovir 
isoproxil monoester, is a metabolite. 
The choice of the excipients as well as their functions has been discussed in the dossier for each of the 
different layers.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Drug excipient compatibility studies included long term and stressed (accelerated) storage conditions.  
During early development different types of fixed dose combination products were evaluated and 
compared in human bioequivalence studie. The single bilayer tablet formulation was selected for further 
development.  
During dissolution method development, both USP apparatus I (baskets) and USP apparatus II (paddles) 
were evaluated, as well as multiple rotation speeds and buffers. The sensitivity of the dissolution method 
to different process parameters and product quality attributes has been evaluated. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. Based on the data presented, the dissolution 
methodology was concluded to be suitable to control the quality of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate tablet. 
For the development of the manufacturing process a systematic risk-based development program was 
applied in accordance with the principles of ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10. The proposed control strategy for the 
manufacture of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate film-coated tablets consists of 
process parameter PARs and design spaces and in-process controls. The manufacturing process 
development focussed on factors that potentially posed a moderate to high risk to achieving CQAs.  This 
evaluation was based on a risk assessment, followed by both multi-factor designs and OFAT experimental 
approaches. Based on the results from these studies, flexible approaches to the final proposed control 
strategy, specifically operational flexibility within multivariate design spaces, is being proposed for the 
tablet film coating unit operation. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 17/125 
 
 
Finished product development was conducted in pilot scale facilities at multiple sites and at the intended 
commercial site to understand the impact of process parameters and minimize risk to CQAs. The process 
was scaled up to  the intended commercial scale. 
The process development studies conducted for doravirine tablet product can be divided in the following 
stages: 
- 
Pilot Process Development Studies: The objective of the pilot process development studies was to 
build process understanding and identify any potential linkages between process inputs (raw material 
attributes and process parameters) and process outputs (in-process material attributes and finished 
product quality attributes), as well as provide an initial starting point for proven acceptable ranges to be 
further evaluated at commercial scale. These studies were designed as multi-factor studies across unit 
operations, i.e., assessing the potential for interactions between process parameters from one unit 
operation to another. 
- 
Commercial Process Development Studies: The objective of the commercial process development 
studies was to further develop the proven acceptable ranges identified from the pilot process 
development studies and establish the final control study at the intended manufacturing site and scale. 
These studies were also designed as multi-factor studies across unit operations. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with PP induction child-resistant closure. Silica gel desiccant is 
added in the bottle to provide moisture protection. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process consisting of spray drying, blending, 
lubrication, roller compaction, tablet compression, film coating and packaging. 
Briefly,  doravirine  spray  dried  intermediate  (SDI)  is  manufactured  by  spray  drying  a  solution  of 
hypromellose acetate succinate and doravirine dissolved in purified water and solvent. The spray dried 
intermediate is combined with excipients, blended and roller compacted to produce doravirine granules. 
Lamivudine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  are  combined  with  excipients,  blended  and  roller 
compacted to produce lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate granules. 
The  granules  are  then  compressed  into  bilayer  tablet  cores.  The  compressed  bilayer  tablets  are  film 
coated. The film-coated tablets are placed into containers for storage, shipping and packaging operations. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of pharmaceutical 
form. 
A design space has been proposed for the following step of the manufacturing process of the medicinal 
product: film-coating. The design space has been developed at commercial scale. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches 
fully support the proposed design space. 
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for the rest of manufacturing steps of the medicinal product. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.

Product specification 
The finished product release specifications includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 30 months under long 
term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, water activity, microbial quality, 
dissolution and crystallinity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All results complied 
with the specification.  
In addition, 3 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results of all samples met the proposed specifications. 
The applicant proposed that the calculations of expiry date for the finished product (start of shelf-life) to 
begin with the date of the addition of the spray-dried intermediate to the other excipients and not with the 
date of active substance addition during spray-drying. The applicant provided data of batches that 
represent the full proposed holding intervals of the bulk product (intermediate) in the finished product 
stability program. Since the applicant has presented acceptable data for finished products manufactured 
with aged SDI the approach is accepted. 
The applicant provided supportive drug product intermediate and bulk hold time studies to support the 
manufacturing process. 
In-use stability study was carried out by simulating a patient's in-use practice the 
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets are considered stable after an in-use periods 
when stored at 30ºC/75%RH or at 30ºC/65%RH. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months and the storage condition “Store in 
the  original  bottle  and  keep  the  bottle  tightly  closed  to  protect  from  moisture.  Do  not  remove  the 
desiccant. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions” as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

Not Applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The proposed finished product tablet is formulated as a bilayer consisting of doravirine in the core and a 
layer and lamivudine and tenofovir disproxil fumarate in the other. The reason for developing a bilayer 
tablet for this product was to preserve the PK performance of the doravirine component (relative to 
co-dosing) and was not driven by physical or chemical incompatibilities.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Doravirine has been pharmacologically characterised as a potent HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor. In biochemical assays, doravirine displays IC50s <15 nM in the inhibition of the 
ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerization catalyzed by HIV-1 RT 
variants (WT, K103N, and Y181C). In cell-based assays, DOR showed EC50s of 12, 21, 31, 55 and 33 nM 
against the WT virus, K103N, Y181C, G190A, and K103N/Y181C mutants, respectively, in the presence of 
100% human serum. Doravirine also exhibited similar antiviral activities (in the range from 1.2 nM to 
10.0 nM) against a panel of 93 wild-type viruses comprised of several isolates from each of 10 different 
HIV-1 subtypes (A through H).  
No activity data for doravirine on HIV-2 and other viruses (HBV and HCV), which is recommended by the 
EMA HIV Note for Guidance on antiretrovirals, has been provided. It is acknowledged that HIV-2 is 
considered to be naturally resistant to the class, but EC50 values differ between available agents, and 
data may still be of interest. While hepatitis C does not have the RT enzyme, and may be irrelevant to 
study, data on hepatitis B should be considered. The applicant was initially asked to submit in vitro data 
on doravirine activity for HIV-2 and hepatitis B. The applicant has provided data on activity of doravirine 
against HBV as analyzed in a HepG2 cell line infected with HBV. In this assay, the EC50 of the test 
compound was >10 µM (10 µM was the highest concentration tested), suggesting that doravirine is not 
active against HBV. Moreover, in PBMCs infected with HIV-2, the antiviral activity of doravirine (EC50 = 
1.25 µM) in suppressing the replication of HIV-2 was lower compared to the activity on HIV-1. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 20/125 
 
 
Cytotoxicity was investigated using different in vitro cell system including proliferating (MT4, HL60, and 
SupT1), stationary, and activated cells (CD4, PBMC, macrophages, and monocytes). Doravirine displayed 
no cytotoxic activity in any cell types tested (CC50 > 100 μM). These results indicate that the antiviral 
activity of doravirine is not derived from effects on cell viability, this is endorsed. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Doravirine and its major human metabolite M9 were evaluated for off-target activity in an in vitro battery 
of binding assays. Doravirine seems to show affinity only to the 5-HT2B receptor using a ligand binding 
assay (IC50=2.5 μM), while in a subsequent cell based functional 5-HT2B assay, no agonist or antagonist 
activity was observed. Consequently, binding of doravirine to 5˗HT2B is not related to 5-HT2B function. In 
the first round of this procedure the full data report from the PanLabs pharmacology activity testing was 
lacking for doravirine and its human major metabolite M9. The requested study reports of binding data 
and functional activity for doravirine and M9 metabolite have been presented by the Applicant. 
The potential for off-target activity of doravirine against mechanistically similar enzymes was also 
evaluated by assessing the inhibitory activity of doravirine with human cellular DNA polymerases α, β and 
mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. DOR exhibited greater than 10,000-fold selectivity with respect to the 
cellular DNA polymerases α, β and γ with IC50s >100 μM. Therefore, doravirine is not likely to inhibit the 
human cellular DNA polymerases α, ß, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. 
The human major metabolite M9 did not display antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 virus or the 
mutants K103N, V106A, and Y181C (IC50 > 8.4 μM). In addition, M9 did not display activity against a 
panel of endogenous targets including >100 different receptors, transporters and enzymes.  
Based on the above, the CHMP considers that both doravirine and M9 seem to have low potential for 
off-target effects. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Doravirine was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays in vitro and in vivo including assessing 
effects on central nervous system (CNS)/neurobehavior in rats and mice, and cardiovascular and 
respiratory function in dogs. There were no doravirine-related effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or 
any of the ECG parameters including QT or QTc prolongation in conscious dogs (through 1000 mg/kg, 
Cmax = 32.7 µM, 14-fold above clinical Cmax). Except for a few isolated findings in rat on righting reflex and 
forelimb grip, oral dosing of doravirine had no obvious neurobehavioral effects in rodents (≥ 450 mg/kg, 
Cmax ≥ 15.2 µM, 6.5-fold above the unbound clinical Cmax). 
In vitro pharmacology studies showed that doravirine has low potency on the hERG channel in transfected 
cells with an IC50 of 88 µM (>160-fold above the unbound clinical Cmax). 
In conclusion, the CHMP is of the view that doravirine does not appear to have a low potential for adverse 
effects on cardiovascular, nervous system, and respiratory functions.       
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant conducted specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies.  
In two-drug in vitro antiviral combination studies, DOR exhibited no antagonistic effects on the antiviral 
activity of any of the 18 licensed antiretroviral drugs from different mechanistic classes within the 
concentration ranges examined, including combinations of DOR with 3TC or TDF.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of doravirine were studied in mouse, 
rat, rabbit, and dog. In vitro studies investigating the plasma protein binding, blood-to-plasma 
distribution ratios and involvement of enzymes and transporters were also conducted. No in vitro or in 
vivo studies were performed with lamivudine or tenofovir disproxil fumarate. 
Methods of analysis 
Bioanalytical methods using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS) were used for the analysis of doravirine in plasma, urine, muscle, and milk samples collected 
during preclinical studies. The bioanalytical methods used in support of GLP studies for the analysis of 
mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog, plasma, and rat milk were validated in accordance with regulatory guidances 
in effect at the time the studies were conducted. The lower limit of quantification was 12 ng/mL, in mouse 
plasma an assay with lower limit of 4.0 ng/mL was also validated. The upper limit of quantification was up 
to 4900 ng/mL. 
For metabolism and excretion studies, total radioactivity in plasma, blood, urine, and bile was determined 
by liquid scintillation counting (LSC).  
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of doravirine was studied following single intravenous (IV) and oral (P.O.) 
administration to mouse, rat, rabbit and dog. The plasma concentration of doravirine decreased in a 
mono-exponential manner in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. The plasma clearance was low (mouse 6.05, 
rat 2.6, rabbit 4.0 (ml/min/kg) or very low (dog 0.44 ml/min/kg). The volume of distribution at steady 
state (VdSS) was moderate (mouse 0.99, rat 1.4, rabbit 2.67, dog 0.9 L/kg). Oral administration of 
doravirine resulted in rapid absorption in mouse and dog (tmax 1 and 0.8 h respectively) and a slightly 
prolonged absorption in rat and rabbit (tmax 3.3 and 3.5 h respectively). The half-life in dog was long 
(21.7 h) compared to the other investigated species (mouse 2.7, rat 6.4, rabbit 9.0 h). The exposures at 
100 mg/kg were found to be less than dose proportional. 
The bioavailability of doravirine was limited by poor solubility. The oral bioavailiability of several different 
formulations of doravirine was investigated in rats (spray dried, crystalline in 10% polysorbate 80 or in 
emulsifying lipids, ball milled in 10% polysorbate 80 and nanosuspension in HPC-dextrose in water) and 
dogs (spray dried, jet milled doravirine in 10% polysorbate 80 and a suspension of nano-milled material) 
in order to increase the exposure. The oral bioavailability was moderate across all species (mouse 39%, 
rat 46%, rabbit 41%, dog 47%) for the spray-dried formulation. However, the formulation in the mass 
balance studies resulted in an even higher bioavailability than the spray-dried formulation in mouse and 
rat, similar in dog, and lower in rabbit.

5 µM, indicating some concentration dependency in plasma protein binding in rats. The major metabolite 
M9 had a smaller unbound fraction in human (at 1 µM 0.09) compared with rat and dog 0.20 and 0.25 
respectively.  
Doravirine does not partition preferentially into the blood cellular compartment in rat, rabbit, dog, and 
human (blood to plasma partitioning 0.90-1.1), in mouse the value was lower (0.65-0.71). Thus, in 
mouse the blood clearance is slightly higher than the plasma clearance, whereas similar blood and plasma 
clearance is expected in rat, rabbit, dog, and human. The metabolite M9 had a lower blood-to-plasma 
ratios (0.7-0.9) in rat, dog, and human. 
The tissue distribution of doravirine was assessed in Wistar and Long Evans rat by QWBA following a 
single oral dose of 5 mg/kg 14C-labelled doravirine. The distribution pattern of doravirine was similar in 
the non-pigmented and pigmented rat. The highest levels of radioactivity were observed at 2 h post dose 
in the following tissues: small intestine, liver, adrenal gland, kidney cortex, Harderian gland, stomach, 
pancreas, and caecum. The highest overall concentrations were observed in the contents of the 
alimentary canal, bile, and urine. Low levels of radioactivity in the brain suggested that doravirine does 
not readily cross the blood-brain-barrier. Doravirine does also not readily cross the plasma-testis barrier. 
In the pigmented rat, the radioactivity in eye tissues and pigmented skin tissue were similar as in the 
non-pigmented rat, suggesting that doravirine does not bind to melanin. Elimination of radioactivity was 
nearly complete from most tissues by 48 hr (Wistar rats) or 168 h (LE rats, 48 h not measured) post-dose. 
Doravirine was observed in foetal plasma suggesting that doravirine can cross the placental barrier. In 
rabbits the ratio fetal/maternal plasma concentration was 0.48-0.52 and in rabbits 0.36-0.40.  
Metabolism 
The metabolism of doravirine was investigated in vitro in liver microsomes or hepatocytes of rat, dog and 
human, and in vivo in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog. Metabolism in vitro was slow (<10% was metabolised 
over a period of 120 min in microsomes), only small amounts of metabolites were observed. In the 
studies with human liver microsomes the metabolites M9 and M10 were identified, with dog microsomes 
only M9 was identified, and with rat microsomes M5, M8, M9, and M10 were identified. 
In clinical studies, M9 was identified as a major metabolite circulating in human plasma (accounting for 
12.9% of the dose). M9 circulating in plasma in the investigated nonclinical species was only identified in 
the mouse (approximately 50% parent and 50% M9). In rats, only trace amounts of some metabolites 
(M1, M8, M11, M12, M13) were identified in plasma. In the rabbit, trace amounts of circulating 
metabolites (M6, M9, M11, and M17) were identified. Also in dog, only trace amounts of metabolites in 
plasma were identified (M15, M16, and M17). The plasma metabolism data indicate that doravirine is 
metabolised more extensively to M9 in humans compared to rats and dogs. Only at much higher dosages 
compared to humans (130-fold and 292 fold) similar unbound exposures to M9 are obtained in rat and 
dog. The biotransformation in mouse is rapid and high exposure to M9 is obtained. In rabbit, M9 is only 
present in trace amounts in plasma. 
In the mouse, 43% of the absorbed dose was observed as M9 in the urine and 25% in faeces. In rat, M9 
was detected only in low levels in urine and bile (≤5% of the absorbed dose). The glucuronide of an 
oxidative metabolite, M7, was identified as the major metabolite in bile (≤24% of the absorbed dose). M7 
is the glucuronide of M9, but is not detected in rat plasma. It is known that some glucuronides are 
unstable and may be degraded in plasma, it appears however that M7 is stable in rat plasma. The data 
indicate that M7 is formed in rat hepatocytes and is directly and efficiently excreted into bile with no or a 
limited distribution to plasma. The major identified metabolite in rabbit was M9 which accounted for 68% 
of the absorbed dose in urine and 16% of the absorbed dose in faeces. In dog, M9 was present in urine 
(16% of the absorbed dose) and faeces (9.8% of the absorbed dose), but not in bile. In bile, M14 and M15 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 23/125 
 
 
were the major metabolites (13% and 12% of the absorbed dose, respectively). Doravirine accounted for 
6% in mouse, 23% in rat, 24% in rabbit, and 39% in dog of the absorbed dose. 
Overall, the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that oxidation, primarily via formation of M9 is the major 
metabolism pathway in all species. In addition, in dog, doravirine is also directly metabolised to its 
N-acetylcysteine conjugate (M15). Furthermore, in rat M9 is further conjugated via glucuronidation (M7 
~25% of the absorbed dose) and in dog via glucosidation (M14 ~15% of the absorbed dose). Overall, 
metabolism to M9 and to metabolites of M9 is the major metabolism route in the non-clinical species and 
humans. Elimination of unchanged doravirine via urine is limited, except in dog where ~40% of the 
absorbed dose is excreted unchanged via urine. 
Excretion 
The excretion of doravirine was studied in mass-balance studies in mice, bile-duct-cannulated rats, 
rabbits, and bile duct-cannulated dogs. In the in vivo studies, unchanged doravirine was found to be 
excreted in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.  
Following oral administration to pregnant/lactating rats, doravirine was shown to be secreted into milk at 
day 14 postpartum. Milk/maternal plasma ration 2 h post dose was 1.47 (5 mg/kg/day) and 1.32 (450 
mg/kg/day). 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
The pivotal toxicity studies were performed in mouse, rat, and dog in which the animals were dosed orally 
for up to 9 months. The mouse/rat and dog were selected as the rodent and non-rodent species for 
doravirine toxicity assessment based on in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles and the demonstration of 
satisfactory pharmacokinetics. The applicant’s justification is considered acceptable and consequently, 
the data generated in these studies are regarded as relevant. 
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant has not presented any pivotal GLP single dose toxicity studies, which is acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Morbidity and mortality 
No morbidity or mortality related to doravirine was observed. 
Clinical observations 
In both rat and dog, sporadic salivation was observed post dose. In dogs (≥10 mg/kg/day) a transient 
clear discharge from the eyes was observed in the 9-month toxicity study. 
In dogs administered 1000 mg/kg/day the animals were observed with discoloured faeces (pale brown to 
white). It is likely that the discolouration is due to non-absorbed whitish doravirine formulation. The 
presence of non-absorbed substance was also reflected in the TK-data where a 100 time increase in dose 
(between 10 and 1000 mg/kg/day), resulted in only approximately 2-fold increase in AUC. In males (≥1 
mg/kg/day) an increased incidence of unformed stools was also observed. 
No test-item related findings were found regarding ophthalmic and ECG examinations. 
Body weight and food consumption 
A reduction in body weight gain was observed in the 3 month toxicity study in mice. In the 450 mg/kg/day 
group the reduction in gain was 16% in females and 33% in males.  
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 24/125 
 
 
Haematology 
Changes in haematological parameters were only observed in the 6-month study in rats. In male animals 
administered 30 and 450 mg/kg/day a mild increase in prothrombin time was observed (control 11.6 sec, 
450 mg/kg/day 12.6 sec). The activated partial thromboplastin time was also increased (control 18.8 sec, 
450 mg/kg/day 20.6 sec). 
Clinical chemistry and urinalysis 
In the 6-month study in rats, female rats administered 450 mg/kg/day were observed with a decreased 
urinary volume (-56%), increased urine specific gravity, and low individual urinary pH values (3 out of 13 
pH=5.5). Furthermore, in several studies in rats including the juvenile toxicity study, yellow-brown, 
needle-like urinary crystals were observed. This occurred mainly in the high dose group (450 mg/kg/day) 
but sporadic findings in lower dose-groups (30 mg/kg/day) were also observed. Water consumption was 
not measured in the studies where the precipitations were observed. The presence of the crystals in urine 
was further investigated in an exploratory study in which it was shown that precipitation of the crystals in 
urine occurred only when urine was collected by metabolism caging and not via cystocentesis. The study 
revealed a high solubility of doravirine in urine and precipitation seemed to be due to sample handling and 
occur ex vivo. In the first round of the procedure, the applicant was asked to further discuss this finding 
and its clinical relevance since it was noted in the 6-month study in rats, that the urinary volume was 
decreased and urine specific gravity increased. The applicant described that urine sediment had been 
assessed in patients and healthy volunteers with no observed treatment-or dose related findings. Thus it 
is agreed that the observed crystals in the urine apparently consisted of unchanged doravirine observed 
when collected ex vivo.  
No test-item related findings in serum clinical chemistry analysis were observed.  
Macroscopic and microscopic observations 
There were no test-item related macroscopic or microscopic findings in any of the studies. 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was performed in all repeat dose toxicity studies (mouse, rat, and dog). There 
were no substantial (i.e. more than 2-fold) sex-related differences in mean systemic exposure. However, 
a larger exposure in female vs male mice and rats was observed. Mean systemic exposure and mean 
Cmax was less than dose proportional over the dose range, with a more pronounced effect in the higher 
dose steps. 
Summary 
Overall, doravirine was well tolerated by the animals with no morbidity, mortality or macroscopic and 
microscopic observations. In the first round of the procedure the NOAELs suggested in the application 
were in some studies lowered following agency assessment. After assessment of the Applicant’s 
response, the NOAELs were re-assessed and consequently the exposure margins. The animal AUC (mean 
M and F) at NOAEL was compared with the human therapeutic AUC rendering the following exposure 
margins in the pivotal studies: in the dog studies, exposure at the NOAEL was 16-20 fold above the 
human therapeutic AUC, in the mouse study 5-fold the human, and in the rat studies 7 fold. 
Genotoxicity 
Doravirine was not genotoxic in any of the studies performed (Ames assay, chines hamster ovary cells, 
and a rat bone marrow micronucleus study). The top doses investigated were however limited, and as a 
consequence also the margin to human exposure. The in vitro genetic toxicity studies were limited by 
solubility and the top dose was 300 µg/plate in the microbial mutagenesis assay and 300µM in the 
chromosomal aberration test in vitro. Exposure in the in vivo chromosomal aberration study was limited 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 25/125 
 
 
by the maximum feasible dose and the margin to human exposure was 5-6 times based on AUC. 
Distribution to the bone marrow was confirmed in the quantitative whole body autoradiography studies in 
rat where the concentration of doravirine in bone marrow was approximately 2-fold the concentration in 
blood. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of doravirine was evaluated in a 6 month study in Tg.rasH2 mice and a two 
year study in Wistar Han rats. There were no test article related unscheduled deaths or differences in 
mortality in any of the studies.  
In the mouse study, 2/25 male mice were observed with adenomas in the harderian gland. No other 
neoplastic or non-neoplastic changes were observed in the animals administered doravirine. The highest 
dose level in this study was (300 mg/kg/day) which correspond to approximately 5-7 times the clinical 
exposure (based on AUC). 
In the 2-year rat study, an increased incidence of benign thyroid c-cell adenomas was observed in 
females administered the highest dose doravirine (450 mg/kg/d) (5 of 50). This finding is not discussed 
in the toxicology written summary. In the study report reference to historical controls are made, the link 
to the actual reference is however not valid. In the first round of the procedure the applicant was asked 
to further discuss this finding and its clinical relevance and possible mechanism. The applicant presented 
the requested historical data and the number of thyroid c-cell adenomas in the high-dose female rat in the 
doravirine carcinogenicity study was within the range observed in vehicle treated female animals from the 
Applicant and from the animal supplier. Furthermore, there was no evidence of progression from 
hyperplasia to adenoma. The findings in the carcinogenicity study could be considered not related to the 
test item, this is endorsed by the CHMP. 
In the male rats, a centrilobular (hepatocellular) hypertrophy in the livers from the high dose group was 
observed (11 of 50). This was explained by hepatic enzyme induction. In the first round of the procedure 
the applicant was asked to provide other observations or references to substantiate the claim that there 
is a hepatic enzyme induction. The applicant discussed this further and supported with references to 
previous data and literature. Furthermore, in an in vitro study in rat hepatocyte cultures an increase in 
Cyp 3A mRNA by doravirine was observed. Thus the explanation that the centrilobular (hepatocellular) 
hyperthrophy is secondary to hepatic enzyme induction is agreed upon by the CHMP. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Doravirine was evaluated in combined male and female fertility and early embryonic studies with no test 
item-related effects in any of the investigated parameters up to the highest dose levels evaluated. Thus, 
for doravirine, the NOAEL for male and female fertility and early embryonic development in rats was 450 
mg/kg/day. No toxicokinetic parameters were collected in this study but the estimated average exposure 
(AUC0 24h) in male and female animals at 450 mg/kg/day was estimated to 279 µM∙hr based on 
exposures from the 6-month repeat dose studies in rats. Based on this prediction, the exposure margins 
at the NOAEL were approximately 7.4-fold the clinical AUC exposure (37.8 µM∙hr) at the 100 mg/day 
dose. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Doravirine was evaluated in separate embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, 
respectively. 
Rat: In the exploratory rat dose-range finding study, no adverse maternal or embryo-foetal effects were 
observed at doravirine doses of up to 450 mg/kg/day. Similarly, in the pivotal rat EFD study, no adverse 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 26/125 
 
 
maternal or embryo-foetal effects were observed at doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 450 
mg/kg/day. Thus, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal development was 450 mg/kg/day 
(AUC0-24hr: 345 µM∙hr), which is approximately 9-fold above the clinical AUC exposure (37.8 µM∙hr) at 
the human 100 mg daily dose.  
In the pivotal EFD study, a high incidence of skeletal abnormalities (malformations and variations) has 
been observed across all dose groups, including the controls. The applicant was asked to discuss these 
results in detail especially in relation to historical control data, which were initially missing. The applicant 
has presented the requested historical data in the Wistar Han rat. The common alterations found in this 
rat strain were generally within the historical control range in the laboratory of the applicant and the 
findings were observed with comparable incidences between the treated and corresponding control 
groups with no dose-response relationship. Thus it is agreed that the fetal abnormalities observed in the 
pivotal rat EFD study are not apparently related to doravirine treatment. 
Placental transfer was confirmed in rats after oral dosing of doravirine (5 and 450 mg/kg/day). The 
placental transfer on GD 20 was similar at both doses and ranged between 48% and 52%.  Lactational 
transfer on LD 14 was approximately 147% (low dose) and 132% (high dose).  
Rabbit: In exploratory DRF studies conducted with doravirine in non-pregnant and pregnant rabbits, 
there was no maternal toxicity at the maximum feasible dose (450 mg/kg/day). Thus, the maternal 
NOAEL was 450 mg/kg/day with an estimated exposure (AUC) of 364 µM∙hr. In one litter of 4 fetuses at 
450 mg/kg/day there was external findings (malformations) consisting of open eyelids in all 4 fetuses and 
a cleft palate in 2 fetuses.  
In the pivotal EFD study, there were signs of maternal toxicity based on a decrease in mean maternal 
body weight gain observed from GD 7 to 21 and from GD 7 to adjusted GD 28 (12% and 62% below 
control, respectively) at the maximum feasible dose of 300 mg/kg/day. At the high dose level there were 
no other effects related to mortality, clinical signs and gross examination. Thus, the NOAEL for F0 
maternal toxicity was 15 mg/kg/day based on decreased mean maternal body weight gain at 300 
mg/kg/day, providing an exposure (AUC) of 81 μM•hr, which is approximately 2.1-fold above the clinical 
AUC exposure at the human 100 mg daily dose. 
Assessment of developmental toxicity in the F1 generation indicates no obvious effects on 
embryonic/fetal viability, fetal weights and sex ratios. However, external fetal examinations revealed that 
2 fetuses from 2 litters showed multiple external malformations (open eyelids and cleft palate) and 
skeletal abnormalities (skull bone malformations). Initially there were concerns that the results of the 
EFD studies in the rabbit indicate doravirine-related developmental toxicity based on multiple external 
abnormalities (malformations) occurring at ≥ 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure ≥315 μM•hr).  The Applicant 
provided historical control data for the findings observed in the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity 
studies in rabbits and it is agreed that all embryo-fetal findings which might be of concern in the pivotal 
study fell within historical control range, were single occurrences, or were restricted to ≤2 litters and 
lacked a dose response relationship. Thus, the fetal abnormalities observed in the rabbit EFD studies are 
not considered to be related to doravirine treatment. 
Placental transfer was confirmed after oral dosing of doravirine (300 mg/kg/day) in the rabbit. On GD 20, 
the foetal exposure represented between 36 to 40% of the maternal plasma concentration at 4 and 24 
hours post-dose, respectively.  
Prenatal and postnatal development  
Doravirine was evaluated in rat pre- and post-natal development studies after oral dosing. Doravirine was 
well tolerated up to the maximum feasible dose (450 mg/kg/day) and there were no test item-related 
deaths, clinical signs or any other effects of the investigated parameters. Therefore, for doravirine, the 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 27/125 
 
 
NOAEL for F0 maternal and reproductive performance and for viability and growth in the F1 offspring was 
≥ 450 mg/kg/day.  
There was no evidence of preweaning F1 toxicity and lack of adverse postweaning toxicity. When 
excluding the increase in motor activity in the 45 and 450-mg/kg/day female F1 animals, which were 
generally within the laboratory’s historical control animal ranges, but not observed in males, the F1 
generation toxicity NOAEL was ≥ 450 mg/kg/day. At NOAEL, the estimated doravirine AUC exposure in the 
F0 generation was 345 µM∙hr, corresponding to approximately 8-fold the clinical doravirine exposure 
(37.8 µM∙hr) at the human 100 mg daily dose. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Two juvenile studies in rats were conducted: one oral dose-range-finding toxicokinetic study and one 
pivotal juvenile toxicity study. The objectives of the exploratory non-GLP study were to determine the 
tolerability and the TK profile of doravirine following repeat daily dose administrations by oral gavage to 
F1-generation juvenile rats from PND 14 to 55. In the pivotal rat juvenile toxicity study (0, 10, 45, 300 
mg/kg/day) there were no doravirine-related deaths, clinical observations, or effects on body weight, 
food consumption, developmental landmarks (vaginal opening and preputial separation), open field 
motor activity, alterations in hematology, and serum biochemistry parameters, or organ weight changes, 
or histomorphologic changes in juvenile rats at the highest oral dose tested (300 mg/kg/day, mean AUC 
for male and females: 333 µM∙hr). 
The only study finding in doravirine-treated juvenile rats was presence of urine crystals observed ex vivo 
following overnight urine collection. This finding was also observed in the repeat dose rat toxicity studies, 
and was stated to be the result of ex vivo formation. The applicant has discussed these data regarding the 
urinary crystals and findings from the toxicity studies regarding possible negative effects on the kidney. 
It is agreed with the applicants suggestion that the urinary crystals consists of unchanged doravirine 
formed during ex vivo conditions and the crystals were not observed by direct in vivo collection of urine 
from rat bladders. The applicant has also described that assessment of urine sediment was part of the 
clinical studies. There were no treatment- or dose related observations in the investigation of the urine 
sediment in either patients or healthy individuals and there were no relevant kidney clinical safety signals. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of doravirine was investigated in two alternative models to the Draize methodology; 
isolated bovine corneas and MatTekEpiDerm tissue samples. Doravirine was classified as a non-irritant. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
There were no observations or changes considered to be due to potential antigenicity induced by 
doravirine. No antigenicity evaluations were thus conducted. 
Immunotoxicity 
The weight of evidence indicated that there is no cause for concern regarding immunotoxicity resulting 
from treatment with doravirine. A local lymph node assay (LNNA) in mice showed no test-article related 
increase in the stimulation index.  
Dependence 
No studies on animal abuse potential were conducted; this was considered acceptable since doravirine did 
not readily cross the blood-brain-barrier. Furthermore, there was no indication of a pharmacologic profile 
consistent with drug abuse liability potential.  
Metabolites 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 28/125 
 
 
M9 was identified in plasma in rats and dogs in the chronic safety studies and peak areas were calculated. 
M9 was also measured in human plasma after administration of 240 mg doravirine per day. The average 
exposure margin in rat (450 mg/kg/day) was in average 0.52, and in dog (1000 mg/kg/day) 0.51. The 
exposure margins for M9 in rat and dog were just above the level to consider M9 as qualified. However, 
the dose of doravirine in the clinical study was slightly higher (240 mg/day) than the highest therapeutic 
dose (200 mg/day) and unbound fraction of M9 in human plasma was lower than in rat and dog plasma 
(0.08 vs 0.18 and 0.24 respectively). Furthermore, in the in vivo metabolism studies in mice, M9 was 
present in plasma after a single oral dose of doravirine (5 mg/kg) at similar levels as doravirine itself. The 
M9 was thus probably sufficiently covered in the 3-month oral toxicity study in mice. Taken together with 
the data from the rat and dog studies, the exposure levels of M9 in patients were adequately covered in 
the chronic toxicity studies. 
Impurities 
An assessment regarding the qualification of several impurities has been made (process impurities, 
degradation products, intermediates, or starting materials) has been conducted.  
A new batch of doravirine was evaluated in a 3-month GLP toxicity study in rat (115 mg/kg/day). In the 
study the mean serum triglyceride level was decreased in the doravirine treated animals. No other test 
article related findings were observed. A known phenol degradate was also investigated in a 3-month 
study in rat (30 mg/kg/day doravirine, 0.4% phenol degradate). No test article related findings were 
observed in the study.   
The fixed dose combination product, Doravirine-Lamivudine-Tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) contains 
100 mg of doravirine, 300 mg of lamivudine, and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). The drug 
product contains an impurity, the tenofovir degradant G. To qualify it was investigated in a 3-month 
repeat-dose oral toxicity study in rats. The animals were administered 0.3 mg/kg/day of tenofovir 
degradant G with or without doravirine. No test article-related findings were observed. Furthermore, the 
micronucleus assay was negative. 
Potential mutagenic impurities were assessed by in-silico analyses for structural alerts followed by Ames 
testing. Three impurities were found to be positive in the Ames assay. Five impurities were negative in the 
Ames assay. In the first round of the procedure the individual assay data was not provided and the report 
for semicarbazide was lacking. Furthermore the assays were not performed under GLP and the applicant 
was requested to provide the data. It was agreed that according to ICH M7(R1) Ames assays performed 
before publication of the guideline which were not performed according to GLP can be acceptable and do 
not have to repeated. The applicant further states that no positive controls for treatment without 
metabolic activation are needed as  “the strain-specific positive controls without metabolic activation 
were tested during phenotypic characterization of the working stocks of all the bacteria used in the Ames 
tests”. The Applicant provided the positive control data from the phenotypic characterization of the 
bacterial stocks used in the Bacterial Mutagenicity (Ames) assays of potential mutagenic impurities. In 
these experiments, all strains responded appropriately to their respective positive controls. The Ames 
assay for semicarbazide was considered negative for mutagenicity after the applicant had provided the 
bacterial stock codes for the phenotypic characterization and specific Ames tests. 
Regarding bisacylhydrazide, in the first round of this procedure the study reports from the in-silico 
analyses for structural alerts using the DEREK software (for Windows or Nexus, Lhasa Ltd) and MultiCASE 
(MC4PC) were lacking. The requested reports for the in silico analyses of BAH and BACH have been 
presented by the applicant. BACH had been further tested and shown to be negative in the bacterial 
(Ames) mutagenicity assay. The classification of BACH as a Class 5 impurity and BAH as a Class 4 impurity 
is agreed upon.

Phototoxicity 
To evaluate the potential phototoxic effects of doravirine, Long-Evans pigmented male rats were 
administered doses of doravirine (0, 30, 450 mg/kg/day) for three consecutive days followed by exposure 
to radiation from a xenon lamp to simulate sunlight. There were no doravirine-related cutaneous or ocular 
findings indicative of phototoxicity. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Doravirine: The water solubility of doravirine is 2.73mg/L (pH 7) and its n-octanol/water partition 
coefficient was determined to be log KOW =2.08 (pH 7). The Phase I surface water PEC (PECSW) was 
calculated using a default Fpen (0.01) to PECSW = 1.0µg/L (>0.01 µg/L action threshold), triggering ERA 
phase II assessment. The environmental fate of doravirine in sludge was assessed with OECD TG314B, 
indicating that doravirine is not rapidly degraded in sludge (an estimated DT50 of 158d and an ultimate 
biodegradation of 2.1%) and that the absorption to sludge solids is weak (Kdoc = 114-157L/kg).  
The degradation kinetics were recalculated by the rapporteur, exchanging the applicant’s SFO based 
kinetics with the one recommended by the FOCUS Degradation Kinetics Workgroup. In sediment/water 
systems, the empirical DT50 at 20°C were 129d-880d in sediment and 76-418d in water. The estimated 
DT50 for 12°C was 274d-402d – indicating doravirine to be very persistent in sediment/water systems. A 
large proportion of doravirine shifts to the sediment relatively quickly (>10% within 10d, 40-47% within 
13d) but there were no signs of extensive biodegradation. Only some minor transformation products were 
detected (<10% AR) and the overall mineralization of DOR to CO2 was between 2.04% and 5.06%. 
The aquatic toxicity profile of doravirine is incomplete as a full activated sludge respiration inhibition test 
report (OECD TG209) is missing. The CHMP requests the applicant to submit this study. The NOEC for 
algae is ≥5.8 mg/L. For daphnids, the initial reported NOEC was ≥6.7mg/L. This NOEC value was based 
on a one-sided statistical analysis. As significantly increased reproduction was seen at a LOEC of 0.78 
mg/l, a two-sided statistical test was considered more appropriate. As increased reproduction can be 
considered a relevant effect as well, it is recommended to use the precautionary NOEC of 0.38 mg/L for 
PNEC derivation and to include this value in the summary of main test results in the ERA and EPAR. For 
fish (i.e. the FELS test), the NOEC is ≥1mg/L. The NOEC and carbon normalized NOEC for the harlequin 
fly (i.e. sediment-dweller toxicity) was 81 and 450mg/kg respectively. 
Lamivudine: In the original market application for the dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine fixed-dose 
combination (Triumeq®) in 2014, it was concluded that “the ERA dossier for lamivudine dossier is 
incomplete”. The applicant has not performed the Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic 
Sediment Systems (OECD TG308), and the Fish, Early Life Stage toxicity test (OECD TG210) studies. 
Antimicrobial effects were not tested using the recommended guideline i.e. activated Sludge, respiration 
Inhibition Test (OECD TG209). This was subsequently addressed by the MAH for Triumeq® in a type IB 
variation procedure. The applicant is asked to submit a full ERA for lamivudine as all active ingredients in 
a combination product should be assessed for their individual environmental risk.  
Tenofovir: The applicant is also asked to submit a full ERA for tenofovir. The applicant is committed to 
generating and submitting new studies for a new independent tenofovir ERA (planned to be initiated in 
3Q18). 
2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Pharmacological characterisation of doravirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 
demonstrates potent antiviral activity in the low nanomolar range against different HIV-1 subtypes (A 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 30/125 
 
 
through H). The potential antiviral activity of doravirine against HIV-2, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were 
during the first round not presented by the applicant. The provided activity data indicate a lower activity 
in suppressing the replication of HIV-2 (EC50 in human PBMCs expressing HIV-2 = 1.25µM) compared to 
HIV-1. Moreover, doravirine was not active against HBV at test concentrations up to 10 µM in vitro. No 
secondary pharmacological targets were identified for doravirine in the in vitro screening for off-target 
activity. In addition, the submitted study report for the pharmacological activity of the major metabolite 
M9 indicates no anti-HIV activity in cellular assays and in receptor assays there were no off-target 
activities observed with M9 (at 10 μM). In the non-clinical safety pharmacology studies there were no 
apparent safety issues identified. Consequently, no additional non-clinical investigations are considered 
necessary by the CHMP.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetic profile of doravirine is considered to have been adequately 
characterized. The exposure of doravirine in the investigated species was low and less than 
dose-proportional over the dose range investigated, with a more pronounced effect in the higher doses. 
The efforts made to increase the exposure are acknowledged. Different formulations were investigated. 
The spray dried formulation resulted in the highest absorption in rat after investigating different 
formulations. However, the formulation in the mass balance studies resulted in an even higher 
bioavailability than the spray-dried formulation. Moreover, the data indicate that absorbed doravirine is 
most extensively metabolised in mouse (~90%), followed by rat and rabbit (~70%) and least in dog and 
humans (~60%). Doravirine is primarily metabolised to M9 in the non-clinical species and humans. M9 is 
excreted via urine or bile or further conjugated in rat and dog. Excretion of doravirine is mainly as 
metabolite via urine. However, in dog ~40% of the dose is excreted as parent compound via urine. 
In the tissue distribution study doravirine was found mainly in the alimentary canal, bile and urine. The 
distribution pattern was similar in non-pigmented and pigmented rats.  
The major metabolite in human, M9, seemed to have been adequately covered in the chronic toxicity 
studies. M9 did not inhibit wild-type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, common mutants, and no off-target 
activity against a wide range of endogenous pharmacological targets. However, only at dosages 
~200-fold higher compared to humans similar exposures to M9 were obtained in rat and dog. 
Doravirine was shown to be directly glucuronidated in rat to a limited extent only (≤2.9% of the absorbed 
dose in bile). However, metabolite M9 (≤5.1% of the absorbed dose in rat bile and urine and not detected 
in rat plasma) appears rapidly glucuronidated to M7 in rat (≤24.4% of the absorbed dose). In rat 
hepatocytes M9 is metabolised to M7 and efficiently excreted into bile with no or a limited distribution to 
plasma.  
The metabolism profile in plasma was investigated in the pre-clinical species mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog. 
Oxidation, primarily via formation of M9 is the major metabolism pathway in all species. In addition, in 
dog, doravirine is also directly metabolised to its N-acetylcysteine conjugate (M15). Furthermore, in rat 
M9 is further conjugated via glucuronidation (M7 ~25% of the absorbed dose) and in dog via 
glucosidation (M14 ~15% of the absorbed dose). 
Toxicology 
The toxicology documentation for doravirine and its fixed dose combination with the approved drugs 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) is comprehensive and studies in general have 
been conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and GLP. The Applicant has sought scientific 
advice for the non-clinical program, and followed the recommendations received. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 31/125 
 
 
 
As doravirine has low solubility in water, the effect of formulation and dose defined the maximum feasible 
exposures in all toxicology species. For doravirine, at the highest dose tested, the maximum achieved 
plasma exposures (AUC0-24hr) in the chronic toxicity studies of the longest duration were 279 µM∙hr (at 
450 mg/kg/day) and 673 µM∙hr (at 1000 mg/kg/day) for the rat and dog, respectively. These exposure 
levels correspond to 7.4-fold and 18-fold the clinical exposure at the therapeutic dose of 100mg/day 
(AUC0-24h,ss 37.8 µM·h), respectively. 
Doravirine was not found to be genotoxic in any of the studies performed (Ames assay, chines hamster 
ovary cells, and a rat bone marrow micronucleus study). The top doses investigated were however 
limited, and as a consequence also the margin to human exposure is low. 
Doravirine was well tolerated also in the two carcinogenicity studies. Initially there was a concern 
regarding observations in the 2-year rat study regarding increased incidence of benign thyroid c-cell 
adenomas in the female, and in the male rats and a centrilobular (hepatocellular) hypertrophy in the 
livers. The applicant provided historical control data and references to previous data and literature. The 
findings in the carcinogenicity study could be considered not related to the test item. 
There was no cause for concern regarding the potential of doravirine to have a potential effect on 
antigenicity, immunotoxicity, or dependence. Furthermore, in vivo studies in Long-Evans pigmented rats 
showed no potential doravirine-related cutaneous or ocular findings that were indicative of a phototoxic 
effect of doravirine.  
The reproductive and developmental toxicology program for doravirine has been evaluated in rats and 
rabbits, respectively. There were no doravirine-related findings in any of the rodent studies with NOAELs 
at maximal feasible dose levels, corresponding to exposure margins of 8.5-fold compared to the clinical 
AUC exposure (at the human 100 mg/day dose).  
Initially there were potential concerns of doravirine-related developmental toxicity in the rabbit based on 
multiple external abnormalities (e.g. malformations) and a range of visceral, coronal and skeletal 
abnormalities occurring at ≥ 300 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure ≥315 µM•hr).  The Applicant provided 
historical control data for the findings observed in the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in 
rabbits and it is agreed that all embryo-fetal findings which might be of concern in the pivotal study fell 
within historical control range, were single occurrences, or were restricted to ≤2 litters and lacked a dose 
response relationship. Thus, the fetal abnormalities observed in the rabbit EFD studies are not considered 
to be related to doravirine treatment. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Doravirine: A Phase IIA ERA assessment plus sediment-dweller toxicity studies has been conducted for 
Doravirine. The overall risk assessment was based on the default (Fpen 0.01) Phase I PECSW (1.0ug/L), 
giving a ground water and sludge micro-organism PEC of 0.25ug/L and 1.00ug/L respectively. The 
sediment PEC was calculated to 60ug/kg. Data for activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (OECD 
TG209) is missing and is requested. The applicant is committed to provide the study in 4Q2018, 
submitting it as a PAM (cf. section 2.3.5).  
While doravirine likely is very persistent in sludge and sediment/water systems, the PBT hazard 
assessment does not indicate that doravirine is a PBT substance. There were also some issues with the 
choice of NOEC/LOEC in the Daphnia test based on statistical test design, resulting in the use of a 
pre-cautionary NOEC of 0.38 mg/L. The conclusion of the ERA does not change with the revision of the 
associated PNEC and RQ values. Beyond that, a full assessment cannot be conducted until all necessary 
studies have been submitted together with an updated ERA.

Lamivudine: The applicant is asked to submit full ERA for lamivudine as all active ingredients in a 
combination product should be assessed for their individual environmental risk. All applicants have to 
submit their own ERA in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended) or a letter of consent to use 
studies from other applicants. The applicant is committed to provide a letter of consent allowing the 
applicant to reference studies for lamivudine from ViiV Healthcare UK Limited. This is stated to be 
currently in progress (cf. section 2.3.5). 
Tenofovir: The applicant is asked to submit a full ERA for tenofovir (cf. section 2.3.5). The applicant is 
committed to conduct studies for a new ERA for tenofovir (stated to be initiated during 3Q18).  
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for doravirine indicates no issues for concern.  
However, as a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively 
on the potential risk of Doravirine to the environment.  
The applicant therefore commits to perform the following studies as follow-up measures: 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant will repeat the Activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (OECD TG209). The 
report will be available in 4Q2018 and will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure. The ERA 
should be updated based on the results of the study. 
The applicant is committed to providing an ERA letter of consent from the MAH for lamivudine. 
The applicant is committed to generating and submitting new studies for a new independent 
tenofovir ERA (planned to be initiated in 3Q18).

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Doravirine/Lamivudine/Tenofovir Disoproxil fumarate 100/300/300 mg fixed dose combination 
(FDC) tablet contains the new chemical entity doravirine and the well-known substances lamivudine and 
tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate salt). The FDC tablet is a bilayer tablet consisting of doravirine in one 
layer and lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil in the other layer. The FDC tablet is supposed to provide a 
complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Thirty-six trials were conducted as part of the clinical pharmacology program; the majority of the trials 
were performed with doravirine as mono-component. An overview of the phase 1 trials is presented in the

Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are well characterised and are not 
further discussed in this report. 
Doravirine 
Absorption  
Doravirine is a poorly soluble compound with a solubility that is pH independent across physiological pH 
values (pKa 9.47). The compound may be classified as a BCS II (low solubility, high permeability) or BCS 
IV (low solubility, low permeability) compound. At doses higher than the therapeutic dose (100 mg QD) 
the exposure to doravirine increases less than dose proportional, this is likely explained by the solubility 
limited absorption of doravirine. Doravirine is a substrate of the transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 
but the influence of P-gp on the absorption of doravirine appears to be minor (refer to the paragraph on 
Interactions below). 
A relative bioavailability study between the commercial doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate tablet formulation and the single entity tablets was performed aiming at evaluating the 
comparative bioavailability between the fixed dose combination (FDC) doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (100 mg/300 mg/300 mg) tablet and co-administration of the single entity tablets 
doravirine 100 mg, lamivudine 300 mg (Epivir®), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (Viread®), in 
healthy male and female subjects under fasted conditions. Doravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir displayed 
similar plasma concentration exposures (AUC and Cmax) when given as the FDC tablet and as the single 
entity tablets. The Cmax of tenofovir following administration of the FDC was slightly lower compared to 
following administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (Viread®), and would not pass the 
conventional bioequivalence level (GMR 0.87; 90% CI 0.78, 0.97). The FDC tablet is the formulation that 
was given in the pivotal phase III study (study P021), and the somewhat reduced tenofovir Cmax is not 
considered clinically meaningful. 
The effect of food intake on the commercial FDC tablet was evaluated, and it was concluded that a 
high-fat meal did not change the exposure to any of the components to any clinically meaningful extent. 
Distribution 
After a single dose intravenous (iv) dose of 100 µg, doravirine had a volume of distribution of 60 L. The 
plasma protein binding was assessed by equilibrium dialysis in human plasma. Two separate assays were 
performed: one at 0.1 µM ad 1.0 µM doravirine concentration levels, and one at 3.0 µM and 5.0 µM 
doravirine concentration levels. The protein binding was moderate across the concentration levels tested 
with a fraction unbound of approximately 25%. The plasma protein binding in the hepatic and renal 
impairment studies was not reported. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 37/125 
 
 
 
Elimination 
In an iv microdose study, doravirine had a clearance (CL) estimated to 4 L/h. The terminal half-life (t1/2) 
reported in different studies was about 15 hours. 
Following a single dose of 350 mg [14C]doravirine approximately 90% of the radioactivity was excreted in 
faeces and 11% of the radioactivity was excreted into urine (mean recovery 101%) (n=6 subjects). 
In faeces, unchanged doravirine accounted for 84% of the radioactivity. It is uncertain to what extent 
unchanged doravirine recovered in faeces was unabsorbed drug or biliary excreted drug. Of note is that 
the systemic exposure to doravirine was low in mass balance study (likely caused by that the formulation 
used was based on the crystalline form of doravirine), which suggests that doravirine recovered in faeces 
to a large extent could be attributed to unabsorbed drug. 
In urine, the primary components were M9 (6.7%) and doravirine (2.2%). Metabolites M8, M10, and M18 
were also detected in urine, but combined, represented only approximately 0.5% of the administered 
dose. Trace amounts of other metabolites (M5, M11, M14, M15, and M19) were also detected in urine. The 
low recovery of unchanged doravirine in urine was supported by data from the SAD study (dose level of 
50 mg), where ~6% was recovered in urine following a 24-hour collection period (although the renal 
recovery was likely underestimated in this study due to limited collection period). 
Additional data obtained for the 100 mg tablet formulation (unlabelled drug) using semi-quantitative 
analysis of pooled plasma indicated that M9 was present in amounts that were approximately 5.6% and 
6.7% of the total drug-related components on day 1 and day 10, respectively, while doravirine levels 
were about 86% and 80% on day 1 and day 10, respectively. These results indicated agreement in the 
levels of M9 observed in the ADME study and those observed following multiple once daily administration 
with the doravirine tablet despite the different formulations used in these trials. In the semi-quantitative 
analysis also metabolite M16 was identified as a metabolite, at levels comparable to M9 (4.5 and 5.3%, 
respectively). 
Renal excretion is the main elimination pathway for the tablet formulation. The metabolite M9 was the 
major metabolite excreted in urine (6.7% of the administered dose, 39.4% of the absorbed dose). 
Including other minor metabolites identified in urine M8, M10, M18), at least 55% of the absorbed dose 
was recovered in urine as either unchanged parent compound or its metabolites. The metabolite M9 was 
a major metabolite excreted in faeces (2.7% of the administered dose, 15.9% of the absorbed dose). In 
total 71% of the absorbed dose could be accounted for.  
As more than 25% of the total clearance of doravirine occurs via metabolism and biliary secretion, it is 
recommended to investigate whether the compound is a substrate for the hepatic uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The in vitro substrate assays were performed at only one concentration level, 
which limited the interpretation of the results. However, the single dose rifampicin interaction study 
indicated that the transporters OATP1B1/3 do not have a major influence on doravirine in vivo 
pharmacokinetics (1.4-fold increase in doravirine Cmax). 
In vitro doravirine was shown to be metabolized by CYP3A4, and this was confirmed in vivo by 
co-administering the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and ritonavir. The major metabolite 
circulating was metabolite M9, which accounted for 13% of the total radioactivity in plasma.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the single- and multiple ascending dose study, a less than dose proportional increase in doravirine was 
observed. The nonlinearity appeared to arise at doses higher than the proposed therapeutic dose 
(100 mg); in addition, the popPK model with a linear clearance from the central compartment captured 
the pharmacokinetics of doravirine up to dose of 200 mg. The time to achieve steady state (2-4 days) and

the accumulation ratios were consistent with the apparent terminal half-life observed and the dosing 
interval. Hence, there were no data indicating time-dependent changes in doravirine pharmacokinetics. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
The population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model was developed based on 20 Phase I trials, 1 Phase IIb 
trial, and 2 Phase III trials (341 healthy subjects; 959 HIV-1 infected subjects). The final model was a 
1-compartment model with first order absorption. The covariates age on CL and body weight on V were 
included in the model. Cmin appeared to be reasonably predicted. Attempts could have been made to 
further improve the model, for example: a 2-compartment model seemed to better describe doravirine 
pharmacokinetics and the model was only developed for doses up to 200 mg. These issues may have to 
be considered if the model is used in the future, but they do not have an impact for conclusions drawn 
about the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response of doravirine in the current application. 
Doravirine pharmacokinetics between healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected patients are comparable. 
Population pharmacokinetic estimates indicate at a 100 mg q.d. dose a steady state AUC0-24h of 
37.8 µM*h, a Cmax of 2.26 µM and a C24h of 0.93 µM. Doravirine pharmacokinetics showed a moderate 
between-subject variability in AUC0-24h, Cmax and C24h of about 27%, 18% and 42%, respectively. 
Intra-subject variability was not evaluated. 
Special populations 
A study in subjects with severe renal impairment (n=8 subjects with renal impairment; n=8 matched 
control subjects), did not indicate any clinically meaningful effect of reduced renal function on doravirine 
pharmacokinetics. The doravirine AUC0-∞ and C24h were increased by 31% and 31%, respectively, and 
Cmax was reduced by 18%. 
A study in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (n=8 subjects with hepatic impairment; n=8 
matched control subjects) was also performed. However, the majority of the subjects with hepatic 
impairment had values within the normal range for bilirubin, INR and albumin, and were categorized into 
“moderate” hepatic impairment (CP score 7-9) due to high scores of the encephalopathy and ascites. The 
effects of hepatic impairment on doravirine pharmacokinetics in subjects with reduced metabolic capacity 
therefore remains somewhat uncertain. But based on the seemingly wide therapeutic window of 
doravirine and also considering that the effect of moderate hepatic impairment probably is less 
pronounced compared to what was observed with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the recommendation on no 
dose adjustment in this subpopulation is considered acceptable. The exposure to doravirine has not been 
evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, and this is reflected in the proposed SmPC. 
The covariates gender, race, body weight, and age (≥18 years of age) are not expected to have a 
clinically relevant effect on doravirine pharmacokinetics. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Doravirine in the combination with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
Upon single-dose administration, doravirine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine or 
tenofovir (when co-administered as Epivir and Viread) and was not affected by co-administration of Epivir 
and Viread. Any interaction between the three components was not anticipated based on what is known 
in vitro and in vivo about the interaction potential of the compounds. 
Multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg QD) reduced doravirine Cmax by 20%. The 
reduction in Cmax is not considered to be clinically meaningful.

 Effects on Doravirine PK exerted by concomitant medicines 
As shown both in vitro and in vivo, doravirine pharmacokinetics is affected by changes in CYP3A4 activity 
and potentially also by changes in P-gp activity:  
Ketoconazole (400 mg QD) increased the AUC0-∞ of doravirine approximately 3-fold. The effect 
appears to be primarily mediated by ketoconazole inhibiting CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of doravirine, 
but inhibited P-gp may also contribute to the interaction. The small effect on doravirine Cmax (1.25-fold 
increase) suggests that ketoconazole does not affect the first pass extraction of doravirine to any major 
extent, but exerts its effect during the elimination of doravirine. 
Ritonavir (100 mg QD) increased the AUC0-∞ and Cmax of doravirine approximately 3-fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively. The underlying interaction mechanism(s) are similar to ketoconazole. 
Rifampicin (600 mg QD, 14 days) reduced doravirine AUC0-∞ by 88%. In addition, the C24hr was below 
the clinical efficacy target concentration of 54 nM. The clinical efficacy of doravirine may be reduced when 
co-administered with rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers, and strong CYP3A inducers are 
therefore contraindicated in the proposed SmPC. 
Rifabutin (300 mg QD) reduced doravirine AUC0-∞ by 50%. The interaction is likely caused by CYP3A 
induction. As rifabutin may be a viable treatment alternative for HIV patients co-infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the applicant used nonparametric superposition to optimize the 
dosing of doravirine and allow for co-administration with rifabutin. The superposition principle approach is 
rather simplistic, but was considered to provide adequate information based on the seemingly wide 
therapeutic window of doravirine and the linear pharmacokinetics within the relevant dose range. The 
exposure to doravirine administered alone at a dosing regimen of 100 mg QD was similar as compared to 
when doravirine at a dosing regimen of 100 mg BID was co-administered with 300 mg QD rifabutin. 
Efavirenz (600 mg QD, pretreatment) reduced doravirine AUC0-24hrs by 62% and C24hrs by 85%. The 
interaction is likely caused by CYP3A induction. The applicant proposes that patients may switch from 
efavirenz to doravirine without any dose adjustments. This is supported since the C24 levels of doravirine 
are expected to reach Emax relatively quickly and since the effect of efavirenz is expected to be sustained 
during the initial period following the switch (efavirenz t1/2 40-55 h). Also, the other components of the 
patient’s antiretroviral regimen are not expected to be affected. 
The effects of an aluminum- and magnesium containing antacid and a proton-pump inhibitor 
(pantoprazole) on the absorption of doravirine was also investigated and provided data to support 
co-administration of doravirine with such agents. No clinically meaningful changes in doravirine 
pharmacokinetics were observed. 
 Effect exerted by Doravirine on the PK of concomitant medicinal products 
Based on in vitro data it could not be excluded that doravirine in vivo was an inducer of CYP3A (and PXR 
mediated enzymes/transporters), and inhibitor of the transporters OATP1B1/3, and OAT3. However, the 
interaction studies performed by the Applicant provided sufficient data to conclude that doravirine only 
weakly induces CYP3A and does not affect any other of the enzymes and transporters investigated: 
•  The geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam were 0.82 
(0.70, 0.97) and 1.02 (0.81, 1.28) for midazolam AUC0-∞, and Cmax, respectively. This suggests that 
doravirine may be a weak inducer; compounds are typically being categorized as weak inducers if they 
reduce the AUC of a sensitive CYP3A4 probe substrate by 20%-50%. Other interactions with CYP3A4 
substrates were performed (atorvastatin, methadone, elbasvir/grazoprevir), and these studies 
indicated even smaller effects on exposure parameters. However, those studies were limited by a 
shorter period of doravirine treatment (5 days). 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 40/125 
 
 
•  The geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for the moderately sensitive CYP3A4 substrate atorvastatin 
were 0.98 (0.90, 1.06) and 0.67 (0.52, 0.85) for AUC0-∞, and Cmax, respectively. 
•  Doravirine did not change the pharmacokinetics of metformin, a probe substrate for OCT1, OCT2, 
and MATE1/2K. 
•  Doravirine did not change the pharmacokinetics of methadone, a compound that is primarily cleared 
via CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Based on comparison with historical data methadone reduced the exposure 
to doravirine. The reduced doravirine exposure observed in the study as compared to historical data 
may be caused by between-study variability. It is also possible that methadone has some inducing 
effects on doravirine elimination, as the clearance of methadone is known to have a time-dependent 
increase presumably caused by CYP3A4 autoinduction. 
•  Doravirine increased the exposure to dolutegravir: AUC0-24hr and Cmax were increased by 36% 
and 43%, respectively. The generalizability of these results is however limited by the high dose of 
doravirine used in the trial (200 mg QD). Similar increases in dolutegravir exposure are accepted 
without dose adjustment in the Tivicay SmPC, and the recommendation on no dose adjustment in 
proposed Doravirine SmPC is therefore accepted. Doravirine exposure was unaffected by dolutegravir. 
•  Doravirine did not change the pharmacokinetics of elbasvir and grazoprevir. Grazoprevir is a 
sensitive OATP1B1/3 with several-fold increase in exposure when being co-administered with the 
OATP1B1/3 inhibitor rifampicin. Hence, these results suggest that doravirine is not an in vivo relevant 
OATP1B1/3 inhibitor. Both grazoprevir and elbasvir are also sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. 
Exposure-response 
The exposure-response analyses indicated a close to flat exposure-response relationship for doravirine: a 
similar response was seen with the exposures yielded by the four doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 
mg QD) in the Phase IIb study. There was no apparent difference in response at week 48 by Cmin 
quartiles (see figure below).  It would also be of interest to see the exposure-response analysis for week 
24. This is further discussed under clinical efficacy section.

Administration of 25 mg to 200 mg QD Doravirine with FTC/TDF (P007, N=217) 
The exposure-safety analysis did not cover exposures from higher doses than 200 mg. Hence, any 
potential issues regarding safety at higher exposures (e.g., upon co-administration with CYP3A4 
inhibitors) were not covered by the exposure-safety analysis. 
Discussion of Pharmacokinetics 
The CHMP is of the view that the pharmacokinetics of doravirine has been adequately characterised. 
The applicant has justified that the recommendations upon co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
moderate inducers are adequate. The recommendation that no dose adjustment is needed in case of 
co-treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is considered acceptable (See Discussion on Clinical Safety). 
The applicant has discussed dose adjustment when doravirine is co-medicated with moderate CYP3A 
inducers other than rifabutin. The applicant states that it is difficult to predict the effect of moderate 
inducers not studied in vivo and as a general recommendation should not be given. This is agreed by the 
CHMP. Thus, based on in vivo data the recommendation to dose doravirine 100 mg BID when 
co-administrated with rifabutin is acceptable by the CHMP, while other moderate CYP3A inducers has not 
been studied. This is reflected in the SmPC.

2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Doravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication by 
non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT).  X-ray crystal structure analyses show 
that the compound binds to the classic NNRTI binding pocket. 
Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil are nucleoside analogues (cytidine and adenosine, respectively), 
inhibiting the reverse transcriptase step of the viral life cycle via DNA chain termination after 
incorporation of the active moiety (i.e. phosphyrlized) analogue. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Lamivudine and tenofovir disproxil  
The pharmacodynamics of lamivudine and tenofovir disproxil are well characterised and are not further 
discussed in this report. Both are metabolized sequentially by intracellular kinases to tenofovir 
diphosphate and lamivudine triphosphate, the active moieties, with extended intracellular half-lives 
supporting once daily dosing. Both agents are also active to hepatitis B virus, where tenofovir disoproxil 
has been a first line agent for the treatment of this infection for many years. No antagonistic activity was 
shown in vitro when doravirine was combined with lamivudine and with tenofovir dispoproxil. 
Antiviral activity in vitro - study PD002 
Antiviral assays were performed using variants of a laboratory HIV-1 isolate, R8, and MT-4 human 
T-lymphoid cells during low multiplicity of infection (moi) conditions, in the presence of normal human 
serum (NHS) in a proportion of 10%, 50% (using MT-4 human T-lymphoid cells) and 100% (using 
MT4-gag-GFP cells). 
In these experiments both wild type (WT) and mutant variants were used, and doravirine was studied in 
parallel with rilpivirine and etravirine. Outcomes are shown below. It is noted that addition of serum 
(protein) has less impact on doravirine activity, than on the activity of the other NNRTIs. This is linked to 
the lower protein binding of doravirine (76%), where the protein binding of the other NNRTIs is >99%. 
The minimum Cmin target exposure that was chosen when deciding the doses for doravirine monotherapy 
(efficacy section) was ≥54 nM; the EC95 value for the K103N/181C variant in the presence of 50% normal 
human serum.

The antiviral activity of doravirine and the other NNRTIs was also evaluated against 10 different subtypes, 
where the activity was compared to that of a reference strain (doravirine EC50 = 4.2 nM). Activity is 
similar across subtypes, as well as NNRTI agents, where free concentrations in vivo differ between agents 
(discussed previously).

Selection experiments – study PD003 
Resistance selection was conducted with doravirine and efavirenz (EFV) under low- and high- 
multiplicity-of-infection (moi) conditions in cell cultures. 
Under low moi conditions HIV-1 subtypes A, B and C were studied, in the presence of 10% fetal calf 
serum. Here supernatants are removed every three to four days to infect new wells with 1, 2 and 4 times 
the previous drug concentration, i.e. exposing any mutants to gradually increasing concentrations of the 
drug. Concentrations of doravirine were increased from 1x EC95 to 50x EC95. Main results are depicted 
in a coming table.  
For subtype B, two main pathways were seen, where V106A was reported to be the signature mutation, 
seen at lower concentrations, and where F227L or L234I developed in addition to V106 at higher 
concentrations. Other minor pathways were also identified; the one specifically mentioned being the 
V108I mutant followed by the emergence of V106A and L234I substitutions.  
The V108I and V106A mutant viruses per se conferred approximately 4- and 12-fold resistance to 
doravirine (as evaluated in subtype B virus) and where the addition of F227 or L234 yields a high fold 
change (>100). Other minor mutations identified were V106I, F227V, H221Y, M230I, P236L, and Y318F.

In subtype A virus the pathway also started with V106A, but with minor populations found with V016M, 
with the addition of F227L (minor populations with C or V substitutions), followed by triple mutants 
including L234I or V106 A. Again, a minor pathway started with V108I as the first mutant. 
In subtype C, again V106A was a signature mutation, followed by added F227I in one pathway. V106M 
started another pathway, where F227C emerged in a second step.

V106A → V106A/F227I 
V106M → V106M/F227 
In summary, in subtypes A, B and C, V106A (signature mutation) and F227 (evolving thereafter) account 
for the majority of mutants in the breakthrough viruses under low moi conditions, where the 106A 
mutation per se confers around 10-fold decrease in susceptibility (FC only evaluated in subtype B virus), 
and double mutants conferring a high fold change (>100).   
- The V106A mutation is listed as a major mutation for nevirapine, but not the other NNRTIs.  
- The V106 M mutation (one signature mutation in subtype C and A), is the second most common 
substitution seen at failure with efavirenz in subtype C-infection (seen in around 20% of failures, K103N 
being the most common, seen in >50% of cases). When looking at the prevalence of NNRTI mutations (by 
common population sequencing) in newly diagnosed patients in low income regions where efavirenz has 
been used for long times, V106M is much less frequent than the K103N substitution (~factor 10) (WHO 
Drug Resistant report 2017), indicating that the V106 mutations has a higher negative impact on viral 
fitness. 
Subtype B virus was also studied under high moi conditions at set selection pressures (3x, 10x and 30x 
the IC95 for WT virus), where no supernatant from lower to higher was distributed at time of passage. 
Findings were in line with those seen in low moi conditions. Substitutions V106A, L234I, F227L, and V108I 
substitutions were most frequent, and mainly selected at concentrations 3X EC95 for the WT virus. The 
V108I mutation is involved in several minor mutation pathways, but not listed as a key mutation. 
NNRTI mutations – impact on doravirine susceptibility in vitro 
Monogram Biosciences evaluated the antiviral activity of doravirine, EFV, ETR, and RPV against a panel of 
96 NNRTI resistant clinical isolates by, using their Phenosense assay, table below (HIV subtypes not 
specified in the report, likely subtype B). 
As noted, some NNRTI mutations (or combinations of mutations) that are selected by other NNRTIs, but 
not reported from the selection experiments with doravirine, yield a high FC. A single mutation (Y188L), 
not selected in vitro in the study PD003, but seen in one patient failing doravirine in phase 3, yields per 
se a FC of around 100. This mutation is seen infrequently at failure with efavirenz and nevirapine, and is 
distinctly rare in previously untreated patients, also in settings with a high prevalence of NNRTI resistance 
suh as African regions (e.g. Kityo 2017). For other NNRTI mutations tested, a combination of several 
mutations is needed to yield a higher fold change to doravirine. Of note though, a cut off for a FC that 
would be clinically relevant has not been established, since NNRTI-mutations were part of exclusion 
criteria in the phase 2B/3 studies.

Upon request, further data was presented for K101P, E138A/G/Q, Y181I, G190E, and M230L as single 
mutations (major NNRTI resistance mutations listed by the Stanford database). The results have been 
added to the table below.  M230L and G190E ar mutations that yielded high fold changes (besides G190S, 
V106A and Y188L which were identified in the first round). The mutant containing G190E was actually a 
mutant containing also M41L, L74V and T215F. However, these last three mutations are not known 
among the mutations causing relevant decreases in susceptibility to doravirine. The reduced susceptibility 
of the G190E mutant can therefore be assumed to be mostly due to G190E. Mutations M230L and G190E 
were not selected in in vitro selection experiments with doravirine.

The previous table, indicate that the resistance pattern per se (FC vs wild type) seems rather similar for 
doravirine, etravirine and rilpivirine. To what extent that FC equals resistance in vivo is another issue. The 
clinical cut-off for a FC in reduced susceptibility (and associated NNRTI resistance patterns) to doravirine 
has not been established. 
NNRTI RAMs selected in vivo, in the phase 3 studies 
To be noted, both in the phase 2b study (P007, dose ranging) and the phase 3 studies (P018, P021), the 
full set of NNRTI-associated mutations (as listed by the IAS-USA) were part of exclusion criteria. This was 
(more or less) a necessity in study P007 and P021, efavirenz being the control agent, but not in study 
P018, darunavir/ritonavir being the control agent. 
In the discussion on in vitro dynamics the company proposes that the NNRTI mutations yielding at least 
a 10-fold decrease in susceptibility may be clinically relevant. Further, to quote the Clinical study reports, 
“Doravirine is intended for use in the treatment-naïve population, in whom rates of transmitted NNRTI 
resistance are low, but is also expected to be active against several common NNRTI resistance mutations, 
specifically K103N, Y181C, and G190A”. 
NNRTI mutations that were part of exclusion criteria in the phase 3 studies are shown below, where 
substitutions conferring a FC of around 10 or more are underlined. To recall, for some of these 
substitutions there was no data on in vitro susceptibility presented in the files (K101P, E138A/G/Q, Y181I, 
G190E, and M230L as single mutations).  
Those written in bold type were those (pre-) defined as potentially yielding resistance to DOR in isolates 
from patients who failed DOR therapy. Substitutions P236L and Y318F were not part of exclusion 
criteria, but instead part mutations that were considered in the genotypic analysis in those who failed 
therapy.  
L100I, K101E, K101P, K103N, K103S, V106A, V106I, V106M, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, 
E138Q, E138R, V179L, Y181C,Y181I, Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, G190A, G190S, H221Y, L234I, 
M230I, M230L, P225H, F227C, F227L, F227V 
In phase 3 (doravirine given to 747 patients), de novo resistance was evaluated in cases of protocol 
defined virological failure, PDVF (41= 8 non-responders, 33 rebounders) and in patients who discontinued 
for other reasons (n=75).  Protocol defined virologic failure (PDVF) was defined as one of the following: 1) 
Rebounder: Confirmed (two consecutive measures at least one week apart) HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL 
after initial response of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at any time during the study; Or 2) Non responder: 
Confirmed (two consecutive measures at least one week apart) HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL at Week 24 
or Week 36; OR Confirmed (two consecutive measures at least one week apart) HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 
copies/mL at Week 48.

Successful genotypic tests (baseline + failure) were achieved for 20/41 and 11/75 of these cases, total 
31/116 (others in practice having viral loads of <400 copies/ml, where no test was done). Out of 31 with 
successful testing, numbers failing with de novo NNRTI substitutions were low (table 13). The pattern, 
notably yielded in a population screened for the mentioned NNRTI mutations prior to therapy, is 
consistent with that obtained in the in vitro selection experiments.

In phase 2b (study P007, doravirine dosed 25-50-100-200 mg until all patients had passed week 24, 
followed by 100 mg qd), 15/232 (6.4%) of those treated with doravirine had PDVF, where 3/15 had viral 
isolates at failure with de novo resistance; 2 in the 25 mg group and 1 in the 100 mg group. Only 1 of 15 
cases (25 mg dose, not shown in the previous table) had resistance with an impact on doravivine 
(V106V/I, F227C, FC 66). 
When including all assessable cases from phase 2b (all dosing groups) and phase 3 with any de novo 
NNRTI resistance the V106 substitution was seen in 6 of 11 isolates, accompanied by F227C in 5 of 6 
cases. 
In patients who failed doravirine therapy with doravirine resistance (prior table), the presence of these 
mutations as part of baseline isolates were studied retrospectively with the use of deep sequencing. In the 
5 case studied at present, none of the baseline isolates harboured any mutations (cut off level of 1%). 
With regards the issue of the V106M mutation and subtype C virus (discussed previous part of this 
section), actual numbers of subtype C-infected patients treated in the phase 2/3 studies were presented. 
A total of 67 subtype C-infected patients were treated with doravirine 100 mg in phase 2b/3, and the 
response rate was fully in line with that seen for other subtypes.  Of those 67 treated, the V106M mutation

was seen at failure in 1 patient. It can be concluded that doravirine does not seem to select V106M 
particularly easily in subtype C-infection. 
The prior table on resistance outcomes concern pooled data, but in column 1 it is evident that a single 
case with NNRTI + NRTI resistance was found in study P018 (n=383) versus 6 in study P021 (n=364). 
The difference between the doravirine regimens in these studies is the NRTI backbone, with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine as co-treatment in the vast majority of patients in P018, and with 
tenofovir/lamivudine (all patients) in study P021.

The difference is in line with large analyses on the risk of failure with the M184V mutation (resistance to 
both cytidine analogues) with lamivudine versus emtricitabine (Casper Rokx et al on the Dutch Athena 
cohort, CID 2014; The TenoRes Study Group, Lancet Infect Dis 2016; 16: 565–75).  
The sampling schedule differed between the two phase 3 studies, with more frequent samples specifically 
aimed for resistance testing drawn in study P021 (in parallel with every HIV-RNA sample) than in P018 (at 
the virologic failure (VF) confirmation visit or discontinuation visit). However, when looking at details it 
was clear that cases with de novo resistance was in practice only yielded by patients in the so called PDVF 
population. There was no cases of resistance in those patients who stopped therapy “for other reasons” in 
study P021 (where samples could be used for resistance screening also in such cases).  To maximize the 
information around this finding, the applicant was asked by the CHMP for further analysis of HIV-RNA

samples in study P018 (drawn for viral load counts), if such samples are still available. However, these 
samples had not been stored, and a post-hoc analysis could not be made.  
NNRTI resistance and proposed labelling 
Issues discussed in the prior sections, i.e. the lack of in vivo data on doravirine outcomes in vivo in the 
presence of NNRTI mutations, have implications for the proposed labelling. The CHMP is of the opinion 
that the data presented does not support an indication in the absence of “doravirine resistance”, which 
was initially suggested by the MAH. During the procedure the MAH accepted a revised indication, i.e. 
where doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disproxil is indicated in the absence of past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Doravirine is a new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with a similar in vitro activity, 
measured by EC50 and EC95 values, to HIV lab strains of subtype B to that seen with available NNRTI 
agents. The protein binding is considerably lower for doravirine (around 75%) as compared to that of the 
other agents (>99%), and therefore the shift in EC95 values is less marked (or absent) in cell cultures , 
again in comparison to that seen for the other NNRTIs. The activity was similar for the 10 HIV-1 subtypes 
tested (A through H).  
In selection experiments, undertaken in HIV-1 subtype A, B and C virus, substitutions in V106 and F227 
accounted for the majority of mutants in the breakthrough viruses. This pattern is consistent with that 
seen in those few patients failing doravirine-based therapy with documented resistance in the clinical 
studies.  In panels of viruses with various types of NNRTI resistance substitutions, the patterns of reduced 
susceptibility (fold change versus the values seen in wild type/control virus) was fairly similar for 
doravirine, rilpivirine and etravirine. What fold change that is associated with a reduction if efficacy in 
vivo, dependent on the exposure of free drug concentrations, cannot be fully predicted by in vitro data, 
but would need to be clarified in clinical trials. However, a very cautious approach was taken when 
designing the phase 3 studies, where the complete list of established NNRTI mutations (IAS-USA, with the 
addition of yet one more doravirine-associated substitution) was part of exclusion criteria, also in study 
P018, where darunavir/r (protease inhibitor) served as control. Consequently, there is a lack of clinical 
back-up to support the use of doravirine in patients with resistance to the class; a breakpoint for a 
relevant fold change in phenotypic susceptibility is not established. A study (P0030) was undertaken in 
patients where NNRTI resistance was detected prior to therapy. However, the study is limited to 10 
patients, 2 of whom stopped therapy prior to week 48. Hence, a follow-up is available for 7 patients with 
a baseline virus carrying the K103N mutation, and 1 patient with the G190A mutation. Although the 7 
patients were responders at week 48, this data is too limited to clear the issue. 
When looking at failures in the two phase 3 studies, numbers with de novo NNRTI (and NRTI) resistance 
was low. However, it is noted that the risk of failure with de novo resistance seems higher when doravirine 
was given with tenofovir plus lamivudine (the combination chosen for the fixed dose product) rather than 
with tenofovir plus emtricitabine.  A higher risk of resistance with lamivudine, as compared to with 
emtricitabine, as part of the NRTI backbone has been reported from large scale analyses of real world 
data. The number of failures with resistance in the doravirine phase 3 studies was too low to provide any 
conclusive evidence on this issue. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted are considered satisfactory by the CHMP.

2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
This section shows the main outcomes of doravirine short term monotherapy, exploring 25 mg and 200 
mg qd for 7 days (study P005), the dose response combination therapy (study P007) where doses 
25-50-100 and 200 mg was studied with efavirenz as control, all in combination with tenofovir 
disoproxil/emtricitabine, and finally the phase 3 studies (P018 and P021). In the latter 
darunavir+ritonavir and efavirenz were used as control agents. The efficacy studies were undertaken in 
previously untreated patients, infected with HIV-1 without any resistance to any of the agents in the 
regimens used; any resistance substitutions to the NNRTI class constituted exclusion criteria. 
2.7.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Doravirine short term monotherapy - study P005 
This study was conducted at a single centre in Berlin (October 2011 to April 2012). Results were also 
published (Schűrmann, AIDS 2016) 
The PK target chosen as a minimum exposure was a C24 concentration ≥54 nM, a drug level that would 
be 95% effective in the presence of 50% normal human serum against the NNRTI K103N/Y181C double 
substitution (see pharmacodynamics section). Pharmacokinetic data in healthy subjects (Protocol 
MK-1439-001) suggested that 25 mg qd would yield a mean C24 on Day 1 of 213 nM (4-fold higher than 
target), and that >95% of the dosed population was predicted to achieve C24 >148 nM (2.7-fold above 
that target). 
Men aged 18-55, with a stable health (other than HIV-1 infection), with a VL >10.000 copies/ml, no 
NNRTI resistance mutations (population sequencing), a CD4 count>200 could enter the study. In order to 
minimize the risk for resistance development, once the subject completed the treatment phase of the 
study, initiation of a non-NNRTI-containing, suppressive ART regimen for at least 10 days following 
doravirine treatment was recommended. 
18 patients were included and fulfilled treatment; 9 patients were randomized to doravirine 25 mg (n=6) 
or placebo (n=3) in a panel A. In panel B, another 6 were randomized to doravirine 200 mg and 3 to 
placebo. The treatment duration was 7 days.  
17 patients had subtype B, the other CRF29_BF. Median baseline viral loads were 4.79 (25 mg group), 
4.55 (200 mg) and 4.79 (placebo) log10 copies/ml. Outcomes are shown below, where the viral decay 
was similar between arms. Also when looking at a plotted graph, there is no tendency for a higher activity 
with the 200 mg than with the 25 mg dose (data not shown).

Viral resistance was evaluated at baseline and prior to initiation of suppressive ART on Day 8. In 3 
subjects treated with doravirine the VLs were too low to evaluate resistance on day 8. No resistance 
development was seen in the other 9 cases.

Doravirine exposure increased slightly less than dose proportional; the exposure was similar to that 
observed in HIV-negative men of similar weight dosed 25 and 200 mg qd. All patients (25 mg dose 
included) had a C24 concentration following the first dose that exceeded the C24 target, and the 
geometric mean trough concentrations were approximately 3- to 19-fold above target during days 3-7.  
Dose response combination therapy – study P007 
Design: double-blinded (in-house), randomized, 2-part study comparing doravirine dosed 25-50-100 or 
200 mg to efavirenz 600 mg qd, all in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada). 
Centres (73):   US (25), Canada (3), Puerto Rico (4), Australia (6) 
Belgium (2), France (6), Germany (9), the Netherlands (4), Poland (2), Romania (4), 
Spain (5), Russia (4) 
In part 1, 210 patients were randomized to the different dose groups in equal proportions (about 40 per 
arm). When all patients had passed week 24, a single dose was chosen (the 100 mg dose), and patients 
treated with doravirine were switched to this dose on their next visit, still blinded for a total treatment 
duration of 96 weeks. 
Part 2 was initiated once the dose was selected in part 1; here another 132 patients were randomized 1:1 
to doravirine 100 mg qd or efavirenz 600 mg qd, for 96 weeks of blinded therapy. 
Part I and Part II combined were to provide data to confirm the overall safety and efficacy of doravirine 
100 mg versus efavirenz at Week 24. (i.e. around a total of 100 had received the selected dose of 100 mg 
doravirine) 
Stratification: Screening viral load ≤ or >100,000 copies/mL. 
Primary efficacy end point: Proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 24 in Part I and 
in Part I/II combined. 
Main inclusion/exclusion criteria of interest 
Inclusion 
• 
Treatment naïve patients, with a CD4 count ≥ 100 cells/mm3. 
•  Serum creatinine within normal range (applying to the NRTI backbone).  
Exclusion 
• 
• 
“Resistance to emtricitabine, tenofovir or efavirenz”.  
Patient with active Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection (defined as detectable HCV RNA) or 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection (defined as HBsAg positive). 
The minimum CD4 count was low, having in mind that this is a dose ranging study. The list of NNRTI 
mutations that were part of exclusion criteria (“resistance to efavirenz”) was not stated in the CRF or 
protocol, and was not clarified by applicant. Since the resistance evaluation was performed at a central 
lab (Monogram, US) the issue was dropped.

On the basis of doravirine pharmacokinetics, potent inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4 and potent inhibitors of 
glucuronidation were disallowed, and naturally also medicines not recommended in combination with 
efavirenz (in accordance with the efavirenz SmPC).  
The full analysis set (FAS), all randomized who received at least one dose, was the population analysed 
for efficacy. The term “per protocol population” was not used. Instead, missing values were handled as 
follows: 
 • Observed Failure (OF) Subjects who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment due to lack of 
efficacy were considered as failures thereafter.  
- This population also includes patients who stopped therapy “for other reasons”, and who had a 
detectable viral load in the latest sample prior to discontinuing the study.  
• Treatment-Related Discontinuation=Failure (TRD=F): Subjects who prematurely discontinued 
assigned treatment due to lack of efficacy or adverse experiences were considered failures thereafter. 
• Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F): Subjects who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment 
regardless of reason were considered as failures thereafter. 
Results 
The numbers stopping therapy early, for various non-efficacy reasons, was high, around 30% in the 
important dose finding part 1. In part 2, the discontinuation rate was lower, around 15%. 
The disposition and outcomes at week 24 (i.e. during the dose ranging part, of main interest when 
considering PK/PD and choice of dose) are shown in the tables below.    
There was no tendency for dose response to week 24, and proportions that discontinued the study up to 
week 24 was even between DOR treatment arms.

Secondary endpoint - response at week 48 and 96 
With the common snapshot approach doravirine 100 mg (n=108) and efavirenz (n=107) yielded similar response rates at week 48 (78 vs 79%), and the same 
was true for the OF population ananlysis (81/95 (83%) vs 82/92 (86%), next table. The pattern was similar at week 96, with lower response rates across arms 
due to further discontinuations.

Table 12 Response at week 48, P007, Part 1 + 2 combined. 
De novo resistance to doravirine, as captured within patients with PDVF, was very uncommon, and 
concerned only one case (25 mg dose group), discussed in the pharmacodynamics section. 
Dose Selection for phase 3 
The company considered that efficacy and safety findings were comparable across all tested DOR doses 
(25, 50, 100 and 200 mg). In a PK/PD analysis of study P007, including the four doravirine dosing arms, 
there was no relevant difference in response by steady state C24 quartiles. The 100 mg dose was chose 
for further study, in study P007, and in the phase 3 studies. This dose was considered the best choice, 
since it would be compatible with moderate inducers as well as CYP3A inhibitors as part of co-treatment 
and likely sufficient to cover for virus harbouring several common HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance 
to other NNRTIs, specifically, RT K103N, Y181C, K103N/Y181C, and G190A. The latter point has not yet 
been explored.

2.7.2.  Main studies – P018 and P021 
The two phase 3 studies are described below, both exploring doravirine dosed 100 mg versus a control 
agent (both with 2 NRTIs) in previously untreated patients. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same, except for the list of mutations that were part of the 
exclusion criteria (i.e. tailored with regards to NRTI backbones used, and choice of control (darunavir in 
study P018, efavirenz in study P021). Resistance to the NNRTI class was not allowed, as discussed in the 
prior section.  
• 
• 
The screening viral load needed to be at least 1000 copies/ml  
There was no minimum CD4 count, and AIDS/opportunistic infections are not mentioned as part 
of exclusion criteria. 
•  Creatinine clearance (CG GFR) needed to be at least 50 ml/min (applying to NRTI backgrounds). 
Primary objectives and hypotheses: 
P018 + P021 
Non-inferiority vs control regimen (darunavir/ritonavir and efavirenz, respectively) at week 48, using a 
10% margin, for the key efficacy end points, i.e. <40 and <50 copies/ml at week 48 (FDA snapshot 
approach). 
Study P021: Also safety as part of primary objectives, with the hypothesis that 
doravirine/tenofovir/lamivudine is superior to efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabne with regards to typical 
efavirenz-related side effects (dizziness, sleep disorder, altered sensorium). 
Secondary objectives and hypothesis: 
P018 + P021 
Non-inferiority versus control regimen (same margin and efficacy end points) at week 96 
Safety: particularly concerning serum lipids, where the hypothesis was that doravirine is superior to 
darunavir/ritonavir (P018) and efavirenz (P021) with regards to (lack of) increase in LDL and non-HDL 
cholesterol at week 48. 
Sample size (both studies) 
The power calculations assumed a true response rate of 80% at Week 48 for doravirine and control 
regimens in both studies, using the FDA Snapshot approach. With around 340 subjects randomized to 
each treatment (both studies), the studies had 90% power to demonstrate that the doravirine regimens 
were non-inferior to the control regimens at an overall one-sided 2.5% alpha level.  
Extension phase (for a total of approximately 4 years) 
There is a planned extension phase for another 96 weeks (total study duration of approximately 4 years) 
for both phase 3 studies, to evaluate longer term efficacy and safety for doravirine dosed 100 mg qd.

Study P018 
Methods 
Doravirine 100 mg or Darunavir + ritonavir  800/100 mg (double blind) , both in combination with 
TDF/FTC or abc/3TC (TRUVADA or EPZICOM) in treatment-naïve patients, and without any resistance to 
the agents in the regimens at screening; resistance to the NNRTI class disqualifying. 
Trial dates: Dec-2014 (first patient enrolled) to Nov-2016 (week 48 database lock) 
Study Participants 
Centres allocating study subjects(125):  
US (37), Canada (5), Puerto Rico (3) 
Chile (5), Argentina (4) 
DE (12), UK (8), ES (10), FR (7), Romania (6), Austria (4), DK (3), Italy (1) 
Russian Federation (11), South Africa (3) 
Matching placebos were used, meaning that the total number of daily pills = 4. 
Stratification: HIV-1 RNA level at screening (≤ or > 100,000 copies/mL) and NRTI background therapy 
(FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC). Patients were randomized within each of these 4 strata in a 1:1 ratio. 
Prohibited medications: Moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4 (linked to doravirine), and additionally in 
accordance with the Prezista SmPC. 
1027 individuals were screened, with 252 screening failures (25%), where resistance to any study drug 
was the most common screen failure (13% of screened subjects).

The majority of patients were white men and around half were included at European sites (Russia 
included). Non-B subtype was more common than in many other recent studies (30%). Around 90% had 
tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine as backbone NRTIs.

Reported compliance was similar for the DOR and DRV+r treatment groups; ≥90% compliance was 
reported by around 95% in both groups. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The outcomes and main reasons for non-response by Snapshot using <50 copies/ml were summarised in 
the next table. Outcomes are similar for the two regimens (non-inferiority reached vs 
darunavir/ritonavir). It should be noted that subjects who met defined virological failure criteria (PDVF) 
were to be discontinued regardless of compliance with study therapy. The snapshot algorithm and the 
definition of PDVF differ in several aspects. This explains the discrepancy in the proportions with HIV-RNA 
levels ≥50 copies/ml and the proportions with PDVF (an issue clarified during pre-submission meeting, 
not discussed further in the application).

1) Rebounder: confirmed (two consecutive measures at least one week apart) HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 after having had HIV-1 RNA <50 at any time during the study, 
or 2) Non responder: confirmed HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL at Week 24 or Week 36, or confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48. 
The expected cut-off is <40 copies/ml (i.e. the lower limit of quantification of the HIV-RNA assay used, 
the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay). Results by 40 copies/ml and baseline parameters are presented next. 
Point estimates are similar, and in favour of doravirine for baseline parameters of interest. Point 
estimates for response by age, gender and race were fully similar between arms (data not shown).

Methods 
Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil (100/300/300 mg) or efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil (100/300/300 mg), double blinded, in treatment-naïve patients, and without any resistance to 
the agents in the regimens at screening; resistance to the NNRTI class disqualifying. 
Study Participants 
The trial was conducted at 126 sites:  
33 in the United States, 4 in Canada 3 in Mexico, 3 in Puerto Rico, 4 in Chile, 3 in Colombia, 4 in 
Guatemala, 1 in Honduras, 7 in Peru, 2 in Australia, 1 in New Zealand             
7 in the United Kingdom; 6 in Germany, 5 in Portugal, 4 in Spain, 3 in Belgium, 3 in 
Switzerland, 2 in Denmark,  8 in Russia,  2 in Israel, 9 in South Africa, 6 in Taiwan, 6 in Thailand. 
Trial dates: June 2015 (first patient enrolled) to March 2017 (last visit for primary endpoint). 
Stratification: HIV-1 RNA level at screening (≤ or > 100,000 copies/mL) and hepatitis B and/or C 
co-infection status, yes/no. 
Prohibited medications: Moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4 (linked to doravirine ) and in accordance 
with the efavirenz SmPC.

992 individuals were screened, with 241 screen failures. 141 out of 992 screened (15%) were excluded 
for reasons of baseline resistance (certainly mainly NNRTI-mutations), a high figure in a treatment naïve 
population.  
A slightly higher proportion in the efavirenz-treated arm discontinued study, the difference driven by a 
higher rate of AEs as a reason in this arm (6.3 vs 2.7%), next table.  A somewhat higher proportion of 
patients stopped doravirine due to lack of efficacy (4.9 vs 2.7%).

The proportion of patients that were excluded to form the Per Protocol population was similar between 
arms, and for similar reasons, next table. 
Table 21 Details on the Per Protocol population, P021. 
Demographics were similar to that seen in P018, but with a lower proportion of patients with white race 
(around half), and a higher proportion of patients recruited in non-US, non-EU regions. Baseline factors 
were balanced; the proportion with non-B subtype was somewhat higher in the doravirine treatment arm

95% of patients in both arms.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil was non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil for the primary endpoint, tables below. Although the proportion of responders was somewhat 
higher for the doravirine regimen, the point estimate for PDVF was higher with the doravirine than with 
the efavirenz regimen.  The issue of lamivudine (3TC) versus emtricitabine (FTC) as a potential cause of 
a higher rate of PDVF (and de novo resistance) was raised by the CHMP (please refer to the 
pharmacodynamics section), without any conclusive results.

In this study there is a tendency for lower point estimates with doravirine than with control, for subjects 
who have low CD counts. However, numbers are low, and the differences are far from significant. In 
contrast, in subjects with a CD4 count >200, the point estimate favours doravirine (significant), next 
table.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The company did mainly present pooled results in overviews and summaries.  With regards to efficacy, 
the pooling of results is not supported from the CSRs. This is because the NRTI backbone used in 
combination with doravirine differed across studies. Hence, without pooling, outcomes by viral subtypes 
are shown below. The CHMP notes that the response was similar between subtypes, and not markedly 
different between arms.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
In practice doravirine has not been studied in elderly patients, a consequence of studies performed in 
treatment naïve patients only. In studies P007, P018 and P021 combined there was a total of 11 patients 
aged 65 and above. 
The relative bioavailability of 100 mg doravirine (single dose) was studied in young vs elderly (>65) men 
and women, without a clinically relevant difference in exposure (comparisons within gender). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Efficacy and safety has not been studied specifically for these subpopulations, and that is not considered 
necessary. PK studies in HIV-negative patients with severe renal impairment (not end stage with dialysis) 
and moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B, not child Pugh C) yielded results that do not call for 
dose adjustments by renal/hepatic dysfunction. 
Hepatitis B/C co-infection 
The number of patients with hepatitis co-infection in the phase 3 studies were quite limited (n=49), and 
in the phase 2b study (P007), hepatitis co-infection was part of exclusion criteria. Since doravirine has no 
effect on these viruses per se, and no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment, 
the main interest for this subpopulation is an adequate DDI program allowing for dose recommendations 
of direct antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C. For patients with hepatitis B co-infection, the issue is 
in practice solved by co-treatment with adequate NRTIs. 
2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
On the basis of doravirine in vitro data and pharmacokinetics in healthy adults, short term monotherapy 
(P005) was studied with 25 mg and 200 mg qd, with a similar viral decay. The lower dose is predicted to 
cover (on the basis of free concentration of Cmin values) for both wild type virus and virus harbouring some 
common NNRTI mutations with severe impact on the efficacy with efavirenz.  
The same span was tested in dose ranging combination therapy (25-50-100-200 mg qd), with efavirenz 
as control agent and tenofovir disoproxil emtricitabine as NRTI backbone (P007). The 200 mg dose was 
used to study the safety with that higher exposure, kinetics being close to linear. According to the 
presented analysis, a similar response was seen with the exposures yielded by these 4 doses (no apparent 
difference in response at week 24 by Cmin quartiles). The design and choice of dose for this study is 
supported by the CHMP. The 100 mg dose was chosen for the second part of study P007 and for the phase 
3 studies. This is also accepted by the Committee, since that dose yields an exposure where both a

substantial decrease and increase in exposure, as a consequence of potential DDIs, is likely compatible 
with an unaffected efficacy and safety profile. 
The two pivotal studies are double blinded, with adequate control regimens (darunavir+ritonavir and 
efavirenz). A study with a boosted PI as blinded control is quite welcomed by the CHMP. The CHMP is of 
the opinion though that the main draw back with the design of the phase 3 studies, in particular study 
P018 where darunavir/r served as control, is the full set of NNRTI mutations that were part of exclusion 
criteria. In vitro results indicate that a lower number of more specific mutations could have served as 
exclusion criteria, at least in study P018 (darunavir/r being control agent). At present this has not been 
evaluated in vivo, apart from in a study of too limited size (n=8 followed 48 weeks). Consequently, the 
CHMP considers that the indication needs to be restricted as discussed in the pharmacodynamics section. 
Apart from that no main design issues are seen for the pivotal studies. The non-inferiority margin of 10% 
is endorsed. The discontinuation rate in the phase 3 studies are rather high but acceptable (~15%) by the 
CHMP, and the rate of loss to follow-up was low. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The company has presented outcomes (snapshot approach) using a cut-off of both <40 cps/ml and <50 
cps/ml. The lower cut off is favoured by the CHMP (also mentioned in previous advice), since this is the cut 
off level for the HIV-RNA assay used. Results with the lower cut-off are therefore presented in the SmPC, 
following CHMP requests. When looking at overall outcomes, doravirine was non-inferior to the control 
regimens in the two separate phase 3 studies. Point estimates by various relevant baseline parameters 
were in line with the overall results, for the most slightly in favour of the doravirine regimen. 
As part of summaries, the company has chosen to pool data (100 mg qd dose vs each control regimen). 
Pooling is not supported for reasons discussed in the prior section on dynamics (different NRTI 
backbones). 
The relevance of safety comparisons as part of formal safety objectives is questioned ( i.e. rate of CNS 
side effects with doravirine vs efavirenz and LDL increase with doravirine vs efavirenz and vs darunavir + 
ritonavir). These AEs are well known, and are not seen with the other NNRTIs (rilpivirine, etravirine) or 
other first line agents. These results are therefore not to be part of the SmPC (in line with prior CHMP 
advice). 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Doravirine yielded similar efficacy as darunavir/r, both in combination with 2 NRTIs (in practice tenofovir 
disoproxil/emtriciabine, as Truvada), and doravirine in fixed dose with tenofovir disoproxil/lamivudine 
yielded similar results as efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine (i.e. Atripla), in two double blind 
studies in previously untreated patients without any resistance to the agents included in the regimens. 
The CHMP notes that the MAH did not choose to study the potential impact of NNRTI mutations associated 
with none to moderate impact on the doravirine in vitro susceptibility in study P018 where that could have 
been done (darunavir + ritonavir being control agent).  Very limited data was presented on outcomes in 
patients with baseline virus harbouring 2 common mutations, K103N (8 patients), G190A (2 patients), 
whereof 8 stayed within the study for 48 weeks. This data is too limited to clear this issue.  
Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the available efficacy data support an approval of: 
• 
doravirine (single agent) as part of treatment of patients infected with HIV-1, without past or 
present evidence of NNRTI resistance (including prior failure with an NNRTI-based regimen); 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018

• 
the fixe dose product, doravirine/tenofovir disoproxil/lamivudine, for the treatment of patients 
infected with HIV-1, without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class, tenofovir 
or lamivudine. 
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Doravirine (DOR, also known as MK-1439) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
being developed by the Applicant as a once-daily (QD) oral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adults aged 18 years and older.  It is being 
developed as both the single agent DOR (100 mg) and as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) with lamivudine 
(3TC, 300 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg) (also known as MK-1439A but hereafter 
referred to as DOR/3TC/TDF). 
DOR (in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products) and DOR/3TC/TDF are being developed 
in a hybrid clinical development program that includes mutually supportive Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of 
the DOR single entity and DOR/3TC/TDF. 
Patient exposure 
The trials supporting this Application and contributing data to this Summary of Clinical Safety include 36 
Phase 1 trials, 1 Phase 2b dose-ranging trial (P007), and 2 Phase 3 trials (P018 and P021).  A total of 1657 
subjects received at least 1 dose of DOR or DOR/3TC/TDF in these trials.  
The subjects are included as follows: 
•  678 subjects in 36 Phase 1 trials. 
-  Of the 678 subjects, 650 were healthy subjects.  Other subject populations included 12 
subjects infected with HIV-1, 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 8 subjects 
with severe renal impairment. 
•  232 subjects in P007, a Phase 2 trial that was conducted as a 2-part dose-ranging trial in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. 
- 
Part I:  166 subjects received DOR (in QD doses of 25 mg [40 subjects], 50 mg [43 subjects], 
100 mg [42 subjects], and 200 mg [41 subjects]) and 42 subjects received efavirenz (EFV), 
each in combination with open label emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF (supplied as TRUVADA™). 
- 
Part II:  After dose selection, Part I subjects who were in the DOR 25 mg, 50 mg and 200 mg 
dose treatment groups who continued in the trial were switched to the 100 mg dose of DOR 
at their next planned study visit between Week 36 and Week 72, while maintaining the study 
blind.  An additional 132 subjects were randomized (66 in each treatment group) and 
received treatment with DOR 100 mg QD and EFV in combination with FTC/TDF. 
•  747 subjects in two Phase 3 trials, P018 and P021 (treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects).   
-  Safety follow-up in both trials through Week 48 is provided to support this Application.  The 
trials are ongoing to evaluate long term safety and efficacy through Week 96. These two 
international, multicentre, trials were conducted at different investigation sites. Out of 125 
participating sites in P018 and 126 participating sites in P021, there were only 39 sites that 
participated in both trials.  
- 
P018 is a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active comparator controlled trial 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOR 100 mg QD versus darunavir 800 mg QD plus 
ritonavir 100 mg QD (DRV+r), each in combination with FTC/TDF (supplied as TRUVADA™) or 
Delstrigo public assessment report

abacavir (ABC)/3TC (supplied as either EPZICOM™ or KIVEXA™).  A total of 766 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects received treatment (383 in the DOR treatment 
group, 383 in the DRV+r treatment group). 
- 
P021 is a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active comparator controlled 
clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOR/3TC/TDF QD versus EFV/FTC/TDF 
(supplied as ATRIPLA™) QD.  A total of 728 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects received 
treatment (364 in the DOR/3TC/TDF treatment group, 364 in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment 
group).  
Limited preliminary safety data are available from other ongoing trials, including 2 Phase 2 (P028, P030) 
and 1 Phase 3 (P024) trials.  Data from these trials are not included in the individual safety analyses or 
integrated analysis of this application, the only reported data are narratives of adverse events (AEs) 
leading to discontinuation, serious AEs, and deaths.   
•  P028 is a Phase 2b trial to evaluate a switch from EFV/FTC/TDF (supplied as ATRIPLA™ or generic 
versions of this FDC) or its components [EFV, FTC plus TDF) to DOR/3TC/TDF in 
virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 infected subjects for a total duration of 36 weeks (base study).  
All subjects who complete the base study are eligible for the study extension and, if they provide 
consent, will receive open-label DOR/3TC/TDF for another 96 weeks.  There are two treatment 
groups.  Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either the Immediate Switch Group or 
to the Deferred Switch Group. 
- 
Immediate Switch Group: Immediate Switch (at Study Day 1) from a baseline regimen of 
EFV/FTC/TDF or its components to DOR/3TC/TDF (+ a placebo matched to EFV/FTC/TDF to 
maintain blinding) for 12 weeks followed by treatment with open-label DOR/3TC/TDF for an 
additional 12 weeks. 
-  Deferred Switch Group: Subjects to receive EFV/FTC/TDF (+ a placebo matched to 
DOR/3TC/TDF to maintain blinding) for the first 12 weeks of the study followed by treatment 
with open-label DOR/3TC/TDF for 24 weeks. 
•  P030 is a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOR/3TC/TDF in antiretroviral 
treatment-naïve subjects with HIV-1 infection with selected NNRTI transmitted resistance 
mutations.  The trial includes a 96 week base study and a 96 week trial extension to collect 
long-term efficacy and safety data with DOR/3TC/TDF. 
•  P024 is a Phase 3 trial to evaluate a switch from a baseline regimen of a boosted protease 
inhibitor (PI), NNRTI, or integrase inhibitor based regimen to DOR/3TC/TDF in 
virologically-suppressed, HIV 1-infected subjects for 48 weeks (base study).  All subjects who 
complete the base study are eligible for the study extension to receive open-label DOR/3TC/TDF 
for an additional 96 weeks.  Subjects were assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to either an 
immediate switch to MK-1439A on Study Day 1 (Immediate Switch Group) or a delayed switch to 
MK-1439A at Study Week 24 (Delayed Switch Group).

Adverse events 
The focus of this safety section is the safety outcomes in the phase 3 studies. However, phase II subjects 
receiving the final 100 mg doravirine dose are included in the integrated safety pools and some comments 
are also given on the safety findings in the dose finding phase II study. 
Study P017 
This was a phase I single dose trial to assess the effect of MK-1439 on QTc Interval in healthy adult 
volunteers. Subjects participated in 3 treatment periods and received a 1200 mg supra-therapeutic dose 
of oral MK-1439, 400 mg oral moxifloxacin and placebo in a randomized sequence. It was concluded that 
MK-1439 does not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically relevant degree, as the true mean difference 
(MK-1439 – placebo) in change from baseline was less than 10 msec. Assay sensitivity was affirmed by 
significant QTc changes observed in relation to moxifloxacin. 
Study P007 
In Part I of P007, the overall safety profile at Week 24 was similar for each of the DOR groups. No 
evidence of dose related toxicity was observed. Drug-related AEs were reported for a lower proportion of 
subjects in each of the DOR dose groups (range: 16.7% to 46.5% and 36.7% combined) compared with 
EFV (57.1%). Overall, the proportion of subjects who discontinued due to drug-related AEs was low 
(range: 0 to 4.7% for individual doses and 2.4% for DOR combined versus 4.8% for EFV). 
At Week 96, the proportion of subjects with 1 or more AEs was comparable across the individual DOR 
treatment groups, and between the DOR Combined treatment group (91.4%) and the EFV treatment 
group (96. 3%). 
There were no obvious correlations between doravirine dose and the frequency of overall or specific AEs. 
AEs related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were only seen in the 100 mg and 200 mg groups, 
but numbers are too limited to allow any conclusion. In comparison to EFV, the frequency of dizziness was 
clearly lower in all doravirine groups.

 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event. A subject with multiple adverse events within a system organ class 
is counted a single time for that 
 system organ class. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns is greater than or equal to the 
percent incidence specified in the report title, after rounding. 
 Note: Both doravirine and efavirenz were administered with TRUVADA.

Study P018 
In P018, similar proportions of subjects reported AEs in the DOR group (80.2%) and in the DRV+r group 
(78.3%). The majority of these events were mild to moderate in intensity and were considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug. The proportions of subjects who reported an SAE or a 
drug-related AE were similar for the 2 treatment groups.

 † Based on Miettinen & Nurminen method. 
 ‡ Determined by the investigator to be related to the drug. 
 § Study medication withdrawn. 
 Estimated differences and confidence intervals are provided in accordance with the statistical analysis 
plan. 
 Note: DOR 100 mg QD and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg QD were administered with TRUVADA™ or 
EPZICOM/KIVEXA. 
The most frequently reported AEs (≥5% of subjects in either treatment group presented in descending 
order of DOR frequency) were diarrhoea, headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, 
nasopharyngitis, back pain, dizziness, upper abdominal pain, and cough. Diarrhoea was more frequently 
observed for DRV+r (22.5%) compared with DOR (14.1%) (treatment difference -8.4% [-13.8, -2.9]).  
In the DOR group, back pain, sleep disorder, cough, and sinus  congestion occurred more often. In the 
DRV+r group, diarrhoea, influenza-like illness, oral candidiasis, hypercholesterolaemia and lethargy 
occurred more often.

 Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the 
last dose of study medication. 
 Note: DOR 100 mg QD and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg QD were administered with TRUVADA™ or 
EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™. 
In line with what is expected from protease inhibitors, diarrhoea is more common in the DRV+r group. 
Also, DOR seems to have a more favourable lipid profile compared to DRV+r. Cough, sinus congestion and 
back pain were more common in the DOR group; as similar trends are not seen in the P0021 study (see 
below) this is likely a random effect rather than causally related to DOR. 
Study P021 
In study P021, a lower observed proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the DOR/3TC/TDF group 
(82.7%) compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF group (90.7%) (treatment difference -8.0% [-13.0, -3.1]). A 
substantially lower proportion of subjects reported drug-related AE(s) in the DOR/3TC/TDF treatment 
group (31.0%) compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group (62.9%) (treatment difference -31.9% 
[-38.6, -24.8]). There were also lower proportions of subjects with discontinuations due to AEs (3.0%, 
vs.6.6%) (treatment difference -3.6% [-6.9, -0.5]) and discontinuations due to drug related AEs (2.2%, 
vs. 5.8%) (treatment difference -3.6% [-6.7, -0.8]) in the DOR/3TC/TDF group compared with the 
EFV/FTC/TDF group.

The most frequently reported AEs in either treatment group were dizziness, headache, rash, diarrhea, 
nasopharyngitis, nausea and abnormal dreams. Dizziness was reported more frequently for the 
EFV/FTC/TDF group compared with the DOR/3TC.TDF group (37.1% vs 8.8%) (treatment difference 
-28.3% [-34.0, -22.5]).   
Dizziness, rash, abnormal dreams, somnolence, dermatitis allergic and vertigo were reported for a higher 
proportion of subjects in the EFV/FTC/TDF group compared with the DOR/3TC/TDF group. Hypertension 
was reported more often in the DOR/3TC/TDF group (2.5%) than in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (0.8%).

Adverse Events of Special Interest - Neuropsychiatric Events   
The proportion of participants with AEs in prespecified neuropsychiatric categories by Week 48 were 
pre-defined safety endpoints in P021.  A selected list of neuropsychiatric adverse event categories was 
examined (mapped according to the supplemental statistical analysis plan), including the following: 
•  Prespecified Tier-1 categories/primary endpoints: Dizziness, sleep disorders/disturbances, 
altered sensorium (including disturbance in attention) 
•  Prespecified Tier-2 categories/secondary endpoints: Depression/suicide/self-injury, 
psychosis/psychotic disorders. 
The Tier 1 safety endpoints were subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with p values and 
95% CIs provided for between-group comparisons.

 The five categories of neuropsychiatric adverse event were predefined. Specific terms included for each category were based on MedDRA 19.1. Every subject 
is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event. A subject with multiple adverse events within a category is counted a single time for that 
category. 
 † The 95% CIs were calculated using Miettinen and Nurminen's method. 
 ‡ Superiority is tested sequentially for dizziness, sleep disorders and disturbances, and altered sensorium. 
 * Not prespecified for statistical testing. 
 Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

The rate of neuropsychiatric events is significantly lower in the DOR group compared to EFV where this is 
a well-known concern. A statistically significantly lower proportion of Delstrigo-treated subjects compared 
to EFV/FTC/TDF-treated subjects reported neuropsychiatric adverse events by Week 48 in the three 
pre-specified categories of dizziness, sleep disorders and disturbances, and altered sensorium. In clinical 
practice, it is however noted that the EFV tolerability improves after 2-3 weeks and it is of interest to 
compare not only cumulative rates of neuropsychiatric events but also the incidence and point prevalence 
over time. Such data was requested by the CHMP during the procedure, table below. With time the 
difference in prevalence of these side effects are less marked. This data is fully in line with previous data 
presented for rilpvirine vs efavirenz; around 10% of patients who are treated with efavirenz continue to 
have neuropsychiatric side effects, mainly dizziness and impact on sleep. To some extent this may also be 
an adjustment, where the patients get used to remaining side effects, which could be realised would the 
patient switch to another treatment.

 The five categories of neuropsychiatric adverse event were predefined. Specific terms included for each category were based on 
MedDRA 19.1. Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event. A subject with multiple adverse events 
within a category is counted a single time for that category. 
 Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the last dose of study medication. 
The rate of rash is lower in the DOR group. Similarly to the P018 study, there is a trend towards a higher 
rate of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders in the DOR group but random effects cannot be 
excluded and the causality is not clear.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
Study P018 
Deaths 
One death was reported in P018 by Week 48. A subject in the DOR treatment group experienced an AE 
recorded as “death.” The last reported dose of the study therapy was administered on Day 222. The 
subject had a medical history of tuberculosis, seizures, hypertension, and HIV-1 infection (diagnosed 
approximately 1.5 years prior to first dose of study medication). The subject’s HIV-1 ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) at screening was 70,280 copies/mL; it was 73 copies/mL on Study Day 173. On Study Day 222 (the 
date of the last reported dose), the subject reported dizziness, and subsequently collapsed and died. At 
the time of the death, the subject’s non-serious AEs of mild muscle spasms, mild cough, and mild diarrhea 
were ongoing; the subject had no reported deterioration of health prior to death. No autopsy was 
performed.  In the opinion of the investigator, the death was not related to study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events 
By Week 48, 42 (5.5%) of the 766 treated subjects in P018 reported AEs that met the criteria of SAE.  The 
proportion of subjects with SAEs was similar in the DOR treatment group (5.0%) compared with the 
DRV+r treatment group (6.0%). No single SAE was experienced by more than 2 subjects in the study; the 
most common SAEs (>1 subject in either treatment group) were anal fistula (1 subject each in both 
groups), tuberculosis (2 subjects in the DRV+r group), and back pain (2 subjects in the DRV+r group). 
Two subjects (1 in each treatment group) experienced SAEs that were considered by the investigator to 
be drug related SAEs. 
•  One subject in the DOR treatment group experienced drug-related SAEs of nausea and vomiting.  
The subject experienced acute kidney injury on Day 1 prior to starting study drug.  The subject 
developed SAEs of nausea and vomiting on Day 4 and was admitted to the hospital on Day 6.  The 
subject was discontinued from the trial on Day 1 due to acute kidney injury.  The drug-related 
SAEs of nausea and vomiting were concurrent, and both resolved without dose interruption or 
modification on Day 7. 
•  One subject in the DRV+r treatment group experienced edema peripheral, which resulted in the 
discontinuation of the subject from the trial after 2 months of treatment. 
Study P021 
Deaths 
In P021, two deaths were reported for the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group by Week 48.  Both were 
considered by the investigator to be not drug-related. 
•  One subject in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group was found unconscious on Day 58.  No autopsy 
report or death certificate was available; thus, the reported cause of death was not known.  It was 
reported that the subject had not taken study medication on Day 58 and the reported last dose of 
study medication was on Day 57. 
•  One subject in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group committed suicide on Day 337.  The study 
medication that had been dispensed the previous day was unopened.  The subject had 
experienced traumatic events prior to the suicide and the investigator considered the suicide as 
not related to study therapy. 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 88/125 
 
 
 
Two additional subject deaths were reported as post-treatment (1 in each treatment group) and were 
considered by the investigator to be not drug-related.  These deaths have been displayed as 
post-treatment since the last recorded dose of study medication was >14 days from the date of death.  
However, this reflects the subjects’ last study visit, and not necessarily the day they took the last dose of 
study drug. 
•  One subject in the DOR/3TC/TDF treatment group died on Day 87.  The subject was not 
hospitalized and had last been seen by the investigator on Day 58 at the last scheduled study 
visit.  An autopsy was not performed and the cause of death was reported to be unknown.  The 
last recorded dose of study medication was on Day 58 at the subject’s study visit.  It is unknown 
but presumed the subject was taking study medication at the time of death. 
•  One subject in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group died on Day 384.  The last recorded dose of 
study medication was on Day 338 at the subject’s last scheduled study visit.  It is unknown but 
presumed the subject was taking study medication at the time of death. 
Serious Adverse Events 
By Week 48, 34 (4.7%) of the 728 treated subjects in P021 experienced an SAE. The proportion of 
subjects with SAEs was comparable for the DOR/3TV/TDF treatment group (3.6%) against the 
EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group (5.8%).  No single SAE was experienced by more than 2 subjects in the 
study. The most commonly reported SAEs (>1 subject in either treatment group) were anogenital warts 
(2 subjects in the DOR/3TC/TDF group), appendicitis, endometritis and pneumonia (each of these AEs 
were experienced by 1 subject in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 1 subject in the EFV/FTC/TDF group). 
Five subjects (1 in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 4 in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group) experienced SAEs 
that were considered by the investigator to be drug related SAEs: 
One subject in the DOR/3TC/TDF group experienced 3 drug-related SAEs: asthenia, insomnia, and 
nightmare.  The subject was discontinued from the study on Day 272.  The asthenia was resolving and by 
the data cutoff date, the insomnia had not yet resolved, and the nightmare had resolved with a duration 
of 3.14 weeks. 
Four subjects in the EFV/FTC/TDF group experienced 1 drug-related SAE each as follows:  
•  Hypertriglyceridaemia (dose interrupted and SAE resolved in 1.54 months) 
•  Rash generalized (subject discontinued and SAE resolved in 1.14 weeks) 
•  Rash macular (subject discontinued and SAE resolved in 2.86 weeks) 
•  Rash maculo-papular (subject discontinued and SAE resolved in 2 weeks) 
Overall, the rates of SAEs are comparable between the DOR groups and the respective comparator 
groups. As expected, a very low death rate during the 48 week period makes any comparison between 
groups futile. 
Laboratory findings 
In general, treatment with DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF was well tolerated in the phase 2 and 3 studies.  Few 
Grade 3 or 4 lab abnormalities were reported.  
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 89/125 
 
 
 
 
A higher proportion of subjects with Grade 1 and/or Grade 2 values for total bilirubin were observed for 
the DOR regimen compared with the comparator group. In P007, the proportion of Grade 1 bilirubin 
elevations was 6.1% of the DOR group and 2.8% in the EFV group. In P018, Grade 1 and/or Grade 2 
bilirubin elevations were observed in 6.6% of the DOR group and 1.4% of the DRV+r group.  In P021, 
Grade 1 and/or Grade 2 bilirubin elevations were observed in 6.1% of the DOR group and 0.0% of the EFV 
group.  No subject in either treatment group met the criteria for DILI.  The majority of elevations in the 
DOR group were Grade 1, single, transient elevations, with no pattern of the elevation occurring early or 
late relative to dosing. 
Differences of the DOR regimen were noted versus comparators with respect to fasting lipid test results. 
For LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, the differences in the mean change from 
baseline at Week 48 between DOR and DRV+r and DOR/3TC/TDF and EFV/FTC/TDF favoured the 
doravirine-treatment group in P018 and P021, respectively. The LDL and non-HDL comparisons were 
pre-specified and the differences were statistically significant showing superiority for DOR for both 
parameters. 
Study P007 
In Part I of study P007, all subjects were assigned to 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg or doravirine for a total of 24 
weeks.

† For inclusion in this analysis, both a baseline and at least one on-treatment laboratory value had to be present. Only subjects with a worsened grade from baseline were included. A subject was listed with a Grade X event if his/her highest 
grade during treatment was X. A subject was included in the event of '>X-fold Baseline' if his/her highest laboratory value during treatment fell in this category and was more extreme than the upper limit of normal (ULN). Grading is based 
on DAIDS toxicity criteria.

In conclusion, the CHMP is of the view that the safety profile of doravirine in part I of the P007 study 
appeared similar or superior to efavirenz. There is an apparent U-shape in the rates of lipid abnormalities 
when comparing the doravirine dose arms with higher rates of abnormalities in the 25 mg and 200 mg 
groups, but given the limited size of the respective dose groups this is likely a random effect rather than 
a U-shaped correlation.  
Study P018 
There were no negative trends in haematology or blood chemistry during the 48 week period, apparent on 
a group level. Proportions of subjects meeting pre-defined levels of change and pre-specified comparisons 
between study arms are presented below.

DOR-treated subjects present with higher rates of bilirubin elevation in comparison to the DRV+r study 
arm. DOR appears to have a more favourable lipid profile with lower rates of LDL, total cholesterol and 
triglyceride elevations, in comparison to DRV+r. Both issues are further discussed below.

The lipid profile of DOR is significantly more favourable than that of DRV+r. However, although these 
biomarkers (especially LDL) are correlated to cardiovascular disease in subjects with endogenous 
hypercholesterolaemia and statins have been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events, it does not 
necessarily mean that favourable differences between ART lipid profiles translate to clinical benefit. 
Study P021 
Similar to the P018 study, there were no trends in overall haematology and blood chemistry up to week 
48, apparent on a group level in study P021. Proportions of subjects meeting pre-defined levels of change 
and pre-specified comparisons between study arms are presented below.

†For graded criteria: subjects are counted once per test in the highest grade reported. 
For baseline criteria: subjects are counted in the '>X-fold Baseline' if the highest test value during treatment fell in this category. 
For inclusion in this analysis, both a baseline and at least one on-treatment laboratory value had to be present. Only subjects with a worsened grade from 
baseline were included. A subject was listed with a Grade X event if his/her highest grade during treatment was X. 
n = Number of subjects with postbaseline test results that met the predetermined criterion. 
m = Number of subjects with at least one postbaseline test result. 
LLN = Lower limit of normal range. ULN = Upper limit of normal range. 
Analysis of post-baseline data only includes laboratory records collected after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the last dose of study 
medication.

Similarly to study P018, DOR-treated subjects present with higher rates of bilirubin elevation in 
comparison to the EFV comparator arm. There is also a slightly higher rate of anaemia in the DOR-group, 
without any indication of haemolytic background. This issue of bilirubin elevation and the differences in 
lipid abnormalities are further discussed below.

DOR-treated subjects present with lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to EFV. 
Bilirubin elevation in DOR-treated subjects (P018 and P021) 
Cases with graded bilirubin toxicity were summarized and discussed. Overall, around 6% of doravirine 
treated subjects had graded bilirubin toxicity, vs around 1.5% of those treated with darunavir/ritonavir 
(P018) and 0% of those treated with efavirenz (P021). Still, the MAH concluded that their analysis of the 
data does not suggest a causal relationship between DOR and increases in bilirubin. This is endorsed for 
reasons discussed below. The majority of cases were grade 1 and intermittent, without associated 
increases in transaminases. When looking at doravirine treated subjects with graded bilirubin toxicity, 2 
cases with grade 4 toxicity were clearly linked to other causes (acute hep A, bile duct stone).  One case 
with grade 3 elevation was in fact associated with atazanavir treatment (doravirine had been switched to 
atazanavir due to treatment failure).For cases with grade 2 elevations (9 with grade 2, another 7 with 
grade 1 and grade 2), there were co-treatments (various kinds) that had hyperbilirubinaemia as a labeled 
potential side effect in the majority of cases. The incidence in grade 2 elevations was fairly similar 
between doravirine and control treatment arms.

Cases with grade 1 elevations (n=44), where the difference in incidence of grade 1 toxicity was clearly 
higher with doravirine than with control, had for the most an elevation already at screening and in some 
cases they were taking co-meds during the trial with this potential. Co-meds with potential to increase 
bilirubin were assessed for this group, with no specific pattern (azithromycin 6 subjects, otherwise for the 
most 1-2 subjects per co-med listed). 
When comparing graded bilirubin toxicity in studies P018 and P021 to that seen in previous pivotal studies 
of other approved agents, the following is noted: 
- The incidence of grade 1 elevations during therapy with other antiretroviral regimens presumably 
lacking effects on bilirubin levels have been in the order of 5%, i.e similar to that seen with doravirine in 
the present studies. E.g. in the ECHO study, comparing rilpivirine to efavirenz (ECHO study), the 
incidence were 4% (rilpivirine) vs 0% (efavirenz). In the SPRING-2 study grade 1 elevations were seen in 
4% of patients treated with dolutegravir as well as with raltegravir. In the FLAMINGO study, again 4% had 
grade 1 elevations during therapy with dolutegravir vs 2% (at least numerically lower) of those treated 
with darunavir/ritonavir. 
With regards to eavirenz, there is a clear evidence for a lowering effect on bilirubin levels. Mezger et al 
showed that the level of total bilirubin decreased by 30% in healthy volunteers who received efavirenz 
monotherapy (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2014 ;76: 64-9). Lee et al showed a 40% reduction in levels of 
bilirubin in a limited number of HIV patients initiating efavirenz therapy (Ann Acad Med Singapore 2012 
;41(12): 559-62). Darunavir + ritonavir is also an inducing regimen, and may consequently lower 
bilirubin levels, as indicated in the FLAMINGO study. 
In summary, the difference in graded bilirubin toxicity between doravirine and control agents seems 
rather an effect caused by a bilirubin lowering effect of the control agents (efavirenz > darunavir + 
ritonavir), and where the incidence of bilirubin increases during therapy with doravirine in the phase 3 
studies is in line with that seen with other agents deemed to have no effects. The few cases of more 
severe elevations of bilirubin during therapy with doravirine have been shown to have other very likely 
causes. 
Safety in special populations 
There were only a total of 11 subjects aged 65 years and above (of whom 5 received DOR), and none aged 
75 years and above. The very limited number of participants aged 65 years and above precludes any 
relevant analysis of a potential age-related risk of adverse events. 
Immunological events 
Rash 
Although rash was not defined as an ECI for any of the trials included in this application, it is considered 
to be an important clinical event because rash is commonly associated with use of EFV and other 
members of the NNRTI class.  To evaluate this event, an analysis of all preferred terms related to rash 
(rash, exfoliative rash, erythematous rash, follicular rash, genital rash, generalized rash, macular rash, 
maculo-papular rash, papular rash, pruritic rash, pustular rash, vesicular rash, and viral rash) was 
performed for a pooled safety dataset (MSP, main safety pool). 
A lower proportion of subjects experienced ≥1 AE with a PT related to rash in the Main Combined DOR 
(7.1%) treatment group compared with the Main Combined EFV treatment group (15.7%).  The 
proportions of subjects with the PT of “rash” were notably lower for the Main Combined DOR (3.0%) 
treatment group compared with the Main Combined EFV treatment group (11.0%).

In the Main Combined DOR treatment group, 7.1% of subjects experienced AEs with a preferred term 
related to rash.  Most of these were mild (6%) or moderate (1.3%) in intensity; only 1 was considered to 
be severe (0.1%).  Nineteen subjects (2.2%) had their rash events considered to be related to study drug 
by the investigator. Two subjects (0.2%) were discontinued from the study due to the event of rash. 
In the Main DRV+r treatment group 8.4% of subjects experienced AEs with a PT related to rash.  Most of 
these were mild (6.8%) or moderate (1.3%). Ten subjects (2.6%) had their rash events considered to be 
related to study drug by the investigator. One subject (0.2%) discontinued from the study due to the 
event of rash. 
In the Main Combined EFV treatment group, a higher proportion of subjects (15.7%) experienced AEs 
with a PT related to rash, compared to the Main Combined DOR. Most of these were mild (9.3%) or 
moderate (5.5%) in intensity. Four subjects (2.9%) had events of severe intensity.  Forty eight subjects 
(10.2%) had rash events considered to be related to study drug by the investigator.  Ten subjects (2.1%) 
were discontinued from the study due to the event of rash.

 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns 
meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Main Combined DOR: DOR 100 mg administered with FTC/TDF in P007 and P018 or ABC/3TC in P018, or fixed dose 
combination of DOR/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 100/300/300 mg in P021. 
 Main DRV+r: Darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg administered with FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC in P018. 
 Main Combined EFV: EFV 600 mg administered with FTC/TDF in P007, or fixed dose combination of 
EFV/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 600/200/300 mg in P021. 
 Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the last dose of 
study medication.

The frequency of study subjects presenting with rash is similar in the DOR och DRV+r groups; both clearly 
lower than the EFV group. Rash is a well-known adverse event in EFV-treated subjects, but is usually 
manageable without discontinuing treatment and disappears over time. 
Immune Reconstitution Syndrome 
In the MSP, 14 subjects (<1% of the MSP) experienced at least 1 AE identified by the investigator as 
probably related to IRIS.  A similar proportion of subjects were observed in all three treatment groups 
(Main Combined DOR 0.5%, Main DRV+r 1.8%, and Main Combined EFV 0.8%). 
Three subjects had AEs associated with IRIS that met the criteria to be considered SAE: tuberculosis (1 
subject in the Main Combined DOR group), tuberculosis of central nervous system (1 subject in the Main 
Combined DOR group), and meningitis tuberculosis (1 subject in the Main Combined DOR group).  Each 
of these events were not considered to be true cases of IRIS by the investigator.

 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more 
of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after 
the last dose of study medication. 
AIDS-Defining Conditions 
Seven subjects (<1% of the MSP) in the MSP experienced ≥1 AE identified as related to an AIDS-defining 
condition. None of the AEs were considered to be drug-related.   
Of the 2 subjects in the Main DOR group, 1 subject had a high grade B-cell unclassifiable lymphoma and 
1 subject had Kaposi’s sarcoma. Of the 4 subjects in the Main DRV+r group, 3 had tuberculosis and 1 had

The rates of IRIS and AIDS-defining conditions were similar between DOR, EFV and DRV+r groups. The 
very low number of total events precludes any comparison of subgroups or individual types of events. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were 16 Phase 1 trials conducted to investigate potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) with DOR.  
Across all DDI trials, the safety profile was similar to that observed when DOR was not co-administered 
with another medication.

Only CYP3A modulators have the potential to affect the exposure of DOR to a clinically meaningful extent. 
Moderate and strong inhibitors are expected to increase DOR AUC ~2 to 3 fold.   
Based on the safety and tolerability data from the Phase 1 trials, the use of strong inhibitors was 
permitted in Phase 3 trials. Supporting data include Phase 1 trials where single doses as high as 1200 mg 
and multiple once-daily doses as high as 750 mg were administered to subjects without any apparent 
safety issues. Other supporting data include the DDI trials with strong inhibitors (P002 and P010) and 
preclinical safety margins that provided at least a 3-fold exposure multiple over the increased DOR 
exposure when co-administered with strong inhibitors. 
Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers is likely to reduce DOR PK to a clinically 
meaningful extent, which has the potential to affect efficacy of DOR but without impact on safety. 
Clinical AE summary and counts tables were reviewed for subgroups based on concomitant use (for at 
least 7 days at any time during DOR treatment) of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors for subjects in the 
Main Combined DOR treatment group in the MSP. There were fewer subjects with concomitant use of 
moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (N=67) compared to the subjects without concomitant use of 
moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (N=788); this difference should be considered in the analysis and 
interpretation of data in these subgroups. Of the 67 subjects who were co-administered moderate or 
strong CYP3A inhibitors, 8 received co-administration after the initial 48-week period.  The safety profile 
for these subjects while co-administered moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors was similar to subjects 
without concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors. Concomitant use of moderate or strong 
CYP3A inhibitors did not appear to affect the incidence of AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs, deaths, or 
discontinuations due to AEs.

Only includes AEs occurring or worsening after the first dose of study medication through 14 days after the last dose of study medication. 
The proportions of subjects with diarrhea, nausea, and cough were higher in subjects with concomitant 
use of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors compared to the subjects without concomitant use of 
moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (25.4% vs 11.3%, 19.4% vs 8.6%, and 13.4% vs 3.6%, 
respectively)  
The frequency of several types of AEs is higher (p<0.001 using Fisher’s exact test) in the DOR-treated 
subjects who comedicate with CYP3A4 inhibitors. There was no specific pattern that indicates that the 
differences in AE rates are related to increased doravirine exposure. On the contrary, the most types of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors used in the studies indicate a reverse causality; that the clinical events leading to the 
need of a co medication also were associated with clinical symptoms that are registered as an adverse 
event (e.g. bacterial airway infection with cough requiring antibiotic treatment with azithromycin). 
To provide further justification that co-treatment with CYP inhibitors does not cause safety problems, the 
Applicant listed CYP3A4-inhibitors used in the phase 3 studies together and the rate of adverse events 
was presented separately for those with temporary use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (< 4 weeks) and those with 
concomitant use for more than 3 months. It was clarified that very few patients had used strong 
inhibitors; in practice moderate inhibitors had been used in relevant numbers for a safety evaluation.  
With that said, the AE pattern in those treated for >3 months with such inhibitors were not markedly 
Delstrigo public assessment report 
EMA/874672/2018 
Page 113/125 
 
 
 
 
different from that seen in all DOR treated patients. It was also shown that in the phase 3 studies there 
was no tendency of an association to DOR exposure (by AUC quartiles) for the incidence of the most 
common side effects (Headache, Diarrhea and Nausea). Taken into account that there are no signals for 
serious AEs related to doravirine from the phase 2/3 studies performed, and there is no issue around for 
example QT effects. The recommendation that no dose adjustment is needed in case of co-treatment with 
a strong CYP3A inhibitor is therefore considered acceptable. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study P018 
Through Week 48, a total of 18 subjects experienced AEs that resulted in discontinuation from the study:  
6 subjects (1.6%) in the DOR group and 12 subjects (3.1%) in the DRV+r group.   
Twelve of these 18 subjects discontinued due to drug-related AEs: 4 subjects (1.0%) in the DOR group 
(rash [2 subjects], nausea and nausea/abdominal pain), and 8 subjects (2.1%) in the DRV+r group.   
For 3 subjects (1 in the DOR group and 2 in the DRV+r group), discontinuation was due to an SAE 
(unrelated death in the DOR group; related peripheral edema and unrelated tuberculosis in the DRV+r 
group). 
In P018, there was a smaller risk of discontinuation due to AE in the DOR treatment group (4 events) 
compared with the DRV+r treatment group (12 events). Results of the log-rank test indicate that the time 
to discontinuation due to any AE through Week 48 was longer for DOR compared with DRV+r (p = 0.040, 
not adjusted for multiplicity). Note that for this analysis, 2 subjects in the DOR treatment group who 
discontinued (a subject whose death was reported as the reason for discontinuation on the disposition 
form and a subject who discontinued after the Week 48 window) were censored from the analysis of time 
to discontinuation due to AE.

(P018) 
Study P021 
By Week 48, 35 subjects in P021 experienced AEs that led to discontinuation.  A lower proportion of 
subjects in the DOR/3TC/TDF treatment group (11 subjects, 3.0%) were discontinued from the study due 
to an AE, compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group (24 subjects, 6.6%). The most common AE 
leading to discontinuation was rash, which occurred only in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (12 subjects. No 
single AE leading to discontinuation in the DOR/3TC/TDF group occurred in more than 1 subject. 
A lower proportion of subjects discontinued from the study due to drug-related AEs in the DOR/3TC/TDF 
treatment group (8 subjects [2.2%]) compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF group (21 subjects [5.8%]) by 
Week 48. The main reasons for discontinuation were: 
•  DOR/3TC/TDF group: 4 subjects discontinued from the study due to a drug-related CNS AE, 1 
subject due to drug-related alopecia, 1 subject due to drug-related abdominal pain upper, and 1 
subject with drug-related vomiting. 
•  EFV/FTC/TDF group: 12 subjects discontinued from the study due to a drug-related AE of rash 
and 9 subjects due to drug-related CNS-AE. 
Six (2 in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 4 in the EFV/FTC/TDF group) of the 35 subjects discontinued from 
the study due to an SAE(s):  
•  DOR/3TC/TDF group:  1 subject with drug-related asthenia, insomnia, and nightmare and 1 
subject with esophageal obstruction  
•  EFV/FTC/TDF group:  1 subject each with acute kidney injury, rash generalized, rash macular, 
and rash maculo-papular. 
Overall, the CHMP notes that there was a lower risk of discontinuation due to AE in the DOR/3TC/TDF 
treatment group (10 events) compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group (23 events).  Results of 
the log-rank test indicate that the time to discontinuation due to any AE was longer for DOR/3TC/TDF 
compared with EFV/FTC/TDF (p = 0.018, not adjusted for multiplicity. Subjects in the EFV treatment 
group experienced AEs that led to discontinuation from the study earlier in the trial (~Week 1 to 2 of the 
study) than the subjects in the DOR/3TC/TDF treatment group, and this difference was maintained 
thereafter.

(P021)  
The 48 week tolerability (estimated as time to discontinuation) of DOR appears to be at least comparable 
to DRV+r and superior to EFV. This is in line with the overall safety profiles of the respective study groups 
in the P018 and P021 studies. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of doravirine has been established in two pivotal phase 3 studies (P018 and 
P021), with supporting data from the P007 phase 2 study (P007), rendering a total of 667 patients that 
have been exposed to 100 mg doravirine daily for more than 48 weeks. Both comparators used (efavirenz 
and boosted darunavir) are current preferred (DRV+r) or alternate (EFV) options in the treatment of HIV 
according to EACS guidelines. 
Overall the CHMP is of the view that the safety profile of doravirine (with or without TDF and 3TC) appears 
favourable, with comparable or superior tolerability compared to darunavir (+ritonavir) and superior 
tolerability compared to efavirenz, with a longer time to discontinuation in the doravirine arms in both 
pivotal studies. Compared to efavirenz (also belonging to the NNRTI-group of antiretroviral drugs) 
subjects treated with doravirine present with fewer neuropsychiatric adverse events, a lower risk of rash 
and a more favourable lipid profile. Compared to darunavir boosted with ritonavir, doravirine treated 
subjects present with a more favourable lipid profile and less gastrointestinal adverse events. Airway 
symptoms such as cough slightly more common in the doravirine groups, but could be a random effect of 
the high statistical multiplicity arising when comparing a large number of AE categories between groups.

Low grade bilirubin elevations were more frequent in the doravirine treatment arms (around 6%) than 
with control (darunavir +ritonavir around 1.5%, efavirenz 0%), and this was raised as an “Other 
Concern”. The effect was not dose/exposure dependent within the dose span tested (phase 2b study 
included, where 200 mg was used in one arm), and it concerned mainly intermittent grade 1 elevations. 
After a thorough discussion, the difference seems more likely explained by the very low frequency of  
bilirubin increases with the control agents, where there is evidence for a lowering effect on bilirubin by 
efavirenz (enzyme induction), and where darunavir + ritonavir also have inducing effects. The frequency 
of bilirubin increases with doravirine was in fact in line with those seen in other trials with other agents 
deemed to have no effect of bilirubin clearance. In summary the CHMP considers that no specific further 
investigations are needed on this matter. 
In the phase 3 studies, concomitant medication with moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors were allowed 
although this could elevate doravirine exposure more than 3-fold. The SmPC (section 4.5) states that no 
dose adjustment is needed during co-treatment with strong inhibitors.  To provide further justification 
that such co-treatment does not cause safety problems, the safety outcomes in the phase 3 studies were 
further evaluated. It was clarified that very few patients had in fact used strong inhibitors as part of 
co-treatment. In practice only moderate inhibitors had been used in relevant numbers for a safety 
evaluation. The AE pattern in those treated for >3 months with such CYP inhibitors were not markedly 
different though from that seen in all DOR treated patients. It was also shown that there was no tendency 
of an association to DOR exposure (by AUC quartiles) for the incidence of the most common side effects 
(headache, diarrhoea and nausea). Preclinical safety was favourable, there are no signals for serious AEs 
related to doravirine in the phase 2/3 studies, and there is no issue around for example QT effects. The 
recommendation that no dose adjustment is needed in case of co-treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 
is therefore considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of doravirine, as a single entity and in fixed dose combination with TDF and 3TC, 
appear favourable to the CHMP. No specific safety issues have been identified.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considers that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 30 August 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.11.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of doravirine / lamivudine / tenofovir disoproxil with active 
substances contained in authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not 
a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers doravirine / lamivudine / tenofovir disoproxil to be a 
new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
2.12.  Product information 
2.12.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
2.12.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Delstrigo ( doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir 
disoproxil) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. In addition, it is a 
biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In 2016, around 37 million people around the world were living with HIV-1 infection, around 2 million in 
western and central Europe and North America. Around 2 million were newly infected, and an estimated 
1 million deaths occurred, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this global public health 
challenge, the United Nations AIDS program has led global efforts to establish new targets for HIV 
treatment.  The “90-90-90” goal for 2020 is that 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV 
status, 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV infection will receive sustained ART and 90% of all people 
receiving ART will have achieved viral suppression.  Modeling suggests that if these targets are achieved, 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be controlled globally by 2030, resulting in profound health and economic 
benefits.   
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A large number of antiretrovirals are available, as part of 6 different drug classes: NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, 
INIs, fusion inhibitors (i.e. enfuvirtide) and CCR5 inhibitors (i.e. maraviroc), where the NNRTI class has 
been an important anchor as part of first-line therapy for long, in particular in the low/middle-income 
regions. However, the NNRTI class has been downgraded to an alternative regimen by many treatment 
guidelines, since available agents are associated with some various disadvantages. In some regions, 
NNRTI resistance is increasing at a pace that calls for other first-line options, in particular, if lacking the 
means for resistance screening prior to therapy.  
Doravirine is a new NNRTI that was developed to address these shortcomings, both with regards to safety 
and efficacy. In vitro studies indicate a potential for doravirine to be used in the presence of common 
NNRTI resistance and with an improved barrier to resistance.  
3.2.  Main clinical studies 
Doravirine as single agent (100 mg given once daily), and in parallel a fixed-dose product consisting of 
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil (100/300/300 mg given once daily) has been studied in two 
pivotal double-blind studies in previously untreated patients. Of note, any resistance to the agents in the 
regimens, including to the NNRTI class, were part of exclusion criteria. 
In study P018 doravirine was compared to darunavir + ritonavir, both in combination with either tenofovir 
disoproxil/emtricitabine (as Truvada) or abacavir/lamivudine (as Kivexa/Epzicom); around 90% had 
Truvada as backbone NRTIs.  
In study P021, the fixe dose product was compared to efavirenz /emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (i.e. 
blinded Atripla). Therefore, P021 does not provide a direct comparison of doravirine and efavirenz 
(cytidine analogues being lamivudine and emtricitabine, respectively). Further, the difference in 
backbone between studies for those treated with doravirine precludes pooling of the two doravirine 
treatment arms, and results are presented for the separate studies.  
In a supportive study (P007, dose ranging phase 2b), a direct comparison to efavirenz was done; here 
both agents were given with tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine as backbone NRTIs. Similar response rates 
were seen for doravirine 100 mg qd (n=108) and efavirenz 600 mg qd (n=108).

3.2.1.  Favourable effects 
Doravirine was non-inferior to darunavir + ritonavir in study P018, and doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir 
disoproxil to efavirenz /emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil  in study P021, with the primary end point being 
proportions with HIV-RNA <40 copies/ml at week 48, using the FDA snapshot approach. Point estimates 
were slightly in favour of doravirine on both studies, and results were consistent between arms for 
relevant baseline parameters, including by baseline CD4 count, baseline viral loads, race and gender. The 
immunological improvement was fully similar between regimes. 
Patients failing therapy with documented de novo resistance was very low for doravirine-treated patients 
in study P018 (a single case of 383 treated), and in line with those treated with darunavir + ritonavir (0 
cases/383 treated). In study P021 de novo resistance was documented in 6/364 treated with doravirine 
and in 12/364 treated with efavirenz.  Whether the somewhat higher number of cases with de novo 
resistance development with the fixed dose combination in study P021 is explained by the difference in 
cytidine analogues (lamivudine vs emtricitabine) is unclear. There are disputing findings on that issue in 
the public domain. 
3.2.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal studies support that doravirine is similarly effective to the two relevant control agents used in 
the clinical studies; as stated above, these excluded patients with resistance relevant to the NNRTI class.  
A small study (P0030) was undertaken in patients where NNRTI resistance was detected prior to therapy. 
However, the study is limited to 10 patients, 2 of whom stopped therapy prior to week 48. Hence, a 
follow-up is available for 7 patients with a baseline virus carrying the K103N mutation, and the G190A 
mutation in the remaining case. Although the 7 patients were responders at week 48, this data set is too 
limited to clear the issue. Hence, the potential for doravirine to be also used in the setting of certain 
NNRTI resistance has not been evaluated in a way that would support therapy in the setting of any NNRTI 
resistance. There is a lack of knowledge what resistance and what breakpoints for phenotypic resistance 
are associated with a lowered efficacy. Available data therefore support an indication in patients with virus 
lacking resistance to the NNRTI class, and in addition to the NRTI backbone agents for the fixed dose 
product.  
3.2.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety profile of doravirine has been established in two pivotal phase 3 studies (P018 and 
P021), with supporting data from the P007 phase 2 study (P007), rendering a total of 667 patients that 
have been exposed to 100 mg doravirine daily for more than 48 weeks. 
Overall the safety profile of doravirine (with or without TDF and 3TC) appears favourable, with 
comparable or superior tolerability compared to control in the phase 3 studies, darunavir (+ritonavir) and 
efavirenz. A lower proportion stopped therapy due to AEs with doravirine than with both control regimens. 
Rash, frequently seen with efavirenz (same NNRTI class), was uncommon; 2/747 stopped doravirine 
therapy due to rash in the phase 3 studies. Doravirine does not seem to yield CNS side effects, typically 
seen with efavirenz. The frequency of such AEs was much less frequent with doravirine than with 
efavirenz, and similar in those treated with doravirine and darunavir/r. The frequency of gastrointestinal 
side effects were similarwith doravirine and efavirenz, and less frequent with doravirine than with 
darunavir/r. In contrast to the control regimens, doravirine is lipid neutral. In summary, there are few 
side effects that can be linked with certainty to doravirine therapy, and those reported were of mild 
intensity for the very most. Of note, there was a lack of findings in the pre-clinical repeat dose toxicity 
studies, where indeed no target organ of toxicity was found.

3.2.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the phase 3 studies, elevated bilirubin was seen in around 6% of those patients treated with doravirine 
(vast majority grade 1 elevation), as compared to in around 1.5% of those treated with darunavir + 
ritonavir and in none of those treated with efavirenz. Bilirubin elevations, unconjugated, were most often 
low-grade, isolated and sporadic, but in some cases more severe (grade 2) occurring intermittently or 
repeatedly. No other signs of liver toxicity were seen in these cases. The effect was not dose/exposure 
dependent within the dose span tested (phase 2b study included, where 200 mg was used in one arm). 
Doravirine is not expected to have any relevant effects on CYPs, or tested drug transporters, where an 
inhibition would yield an increase in unconjugated bilirubin. When comparing graded bilirubin toxicity in 
studies P018 and P021 to that seen in previous pivotal studies of other approved agents, it is noted that 
graded bil elevations  is in line with those seen with other antiretroviral regimens presumably lacking 
effects on bilirubin levels. With regards to the control agents, there is a clear evidence for a lowering effect 
on bilirubin levels by efavirenz (Mezger 2014, Lee 2012), likely due to induction of clearing enzymes. 
Darunavir + ritonavir is also an inducing regimen, and may consequently lower bilirubin levels, as 
indicated also in studies other than study P018. In summary, the difference in graded bilirubin toxicity 
between doravirine and control agents seems rather an effect caused by a bilirubin lowering effect of the 
control agents (efavirenz > darunavir + ritonavir).  
Doravirine is a CYP3A substrate, and concomitant medication with moderate and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, allowed for use in the phase 3 studies, could elevate doravirine exposure more than 3-fold. The 
SmPC (section 4.5) states that no dose adjustment is needed during co-treatment with strong inhibitors.  
The number of patients who in fact used strong inhibitors as part of co-treatment in the phase 3 studies 
is very limited. In practice co-treatment in relevant numbers for a safety evaluation concerned moderate 
inhibitors.  That said, the AE pattern in those treated for >3 months with such CYP inhibitors was not 
markedly different from that seen in all DOR treated patients. There was no tendency of an association to 
DOR exposure (by AUC quartiles) for the incidence of the most common side effects (headache, diarrhoea 
and nausea), preclinical safety was favourable and there are no signals for serious AEs related to 
doravirine in the phase 2/3 studies. Doravirine has no relevant effect on QT. The recommendation that no 
dose adjustment is needed in case of co-treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is therefore considered 
acceptable, notwithstanding the increased exposure.

3.3.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.3.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Doravirine in combination with 2 NRTIs yielded similar efficacy in previously untreated patients infected 
with HIV free from resistance to the NNRTI class as two valid controls, efavirenz and darunavir/r. In this 
setting, the resistance barrier seemed somewhat higher with doravirine than with efavirenz, while, as 
anticipated darunavir/r was associated with the lowest risk of resistance in cases of treatment failure (no 
cases). 
The safety profile is clearly favourable, with improvements both as compared to the prior standard NNRTI 
treatment, efavirenz, and the recommended first line boosted PI, darunavir/r. 
During the development of doravirine, a third class has moved forward as perhaps the main first line 
therapy in the EU and the US - the integrase inhibitor class. Agents of this class are also highly effective, 
some with a very high barrier to resistance, and well tolerated. Hence, some of the advantages shown 
with doravirine as compared to the regimens that were chosen as controls in the doravirine program are 
also seen with the integrase inhibitor class. 
In this procedure, the CHMP has concluded that the classification of HIV in the ICH M7 document is no 
longer supported due to the anticipated duration of therapy in HIV, which may well be more than 5-10 
years. The CHMP considers the 1.5 µg/day limit to be relevant for mutagenic impurities, rather than the 
10 µg/day. The applicant should commit to adjusting their control strategy accordingly.

3.3.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects of doravirine, which is in line with that of present standard-of-care, clearly 
outweigh unfavourable effects which seem limited and mild.   
Since doravirine single agent as well as this fixed dose product has been clinically evaluated in the 
absence of NNRTI-resistance, this balance applies to patients infected with HIV lacking resistance to the 
NNRTI-class, and for this fixed dose product in addition the absence of resistance to lamivudine and 
tenofovir disoproxil. 
3.4.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Doravirine/Lamivudine/Tenofovir (Delstrigo) is positive for the treatment of 
adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, 
or tenofovir.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Delstrigo is favourable in the following indication: 
“Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports

in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that doravirine is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

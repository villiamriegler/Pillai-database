The search of Takeda’s Global Safety Database (GSDB) for 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
pantoprazole and SCARs identified 961 cases (1098 events) 
that were reported from 1994 to 2021 across 36 Preferred 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.4 in order to add a warning on 
“Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs)” 
based on post-marketing experience. In addition, the 
MAH proposes to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to 
introduce information regarding Drug-Laboratory 
Interactions. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes and to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet.

Terms (PTs). There was a peak in SCAR cases in 2018 (45 
total, with 10 cases that resulted in death or were life-
threatening). Since then, case numbers have been lower, 
with less reactions resulting in either death and/or being 
life-threatening. There were only 19 cases reported in 
2021, with 2 events that resulted in death or were 
considered life-threatening. In the FAERS database, there 
were 721 cases cumulatively over 5 PTs (AGEP, DRESS, 
SJS, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and TEN). 
In the Vigibase database, there were 565 cases reported 
over 5 PTs (subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, TEN, 
DRESS, AGEP, and SJS). A warning on SCARs was added to 
4.4. of the SmPC accordingly. False positive results in urine 
THC screenings in patients receiving pantoprazole were 
reported in the literature. It was added to 4.5 of the SmPC 
to consider a confirmatory method in these cases.

1. Hypomagnesemia is a rare, potentially serious, adverse 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
1. To update section 4.8 of the SmPC adding 
Hypokalaemia to the list of adverse drug reactions of 
Takeda’s Pantoprazole containing drugs including a 
food note in 4.8 that hypokalaemia may be related to 
the occurrence of hypomagnesaemia based on a 
review of the global safety database for cases

class effect of PPIs. It is typically accompanied by 
and PL 
hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and functional 
hypoparathyroidism. Of the 97 cases of hypocalcaemia 
reported, 85 cases (87%) also included the event of 
hypomagnesemia. The remaining 12 cases which did not 
report hypomagnesemia as an additional event were 
confounded by the patient’s medical history and/or other 
concomitant medications. 32 cases out of 97 cases (33%) 
contained the event of hypokalaemia as well as 
hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesemia. Recovery on

containing the PT “hypocalcaemia” in patients who 
were treated with Takeda PPIs (Dexlansoprazole, 
Lansoprazole and Pantoprazole). The existing 
warning regarding Hypomagnesaemia in Section 4.4. 
is proposed to be adapted accordingly. adding also 
that Hypomagnesaemia may lead to hypocalcaemia 
and/or hypokalaemia and that hypomagnesaemia 
associated hypocalcaemia and/or hypokalaemia 
improved after magnesium replacement and 
discontinuation of the PPI. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly.  
2. To update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms) with the frequency “unknown” 
based on a comprehensive review of the global 
safety database for all cases containing the PT “Drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms” 
on  all PPIs that are currently marketed by Takeda 
(i.e. lansoprazole, pantoprazole sodium, 
pantoprazole magnesium and dexlansoprazole). The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the last QRD template (version 
10.1), to update the list of local representatives and 
to implement editorial corrections to the PI. 
The requested grouped work-sharing procedure 
proposed amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
cessation of PPI use and recurrence of the event upon re-
challenge, strengthened the causal association.  
2. 69 (72 events) cases of DRESS were identified with 
patients on pantoprazole. The cases reported with 
pantoprazole amounted to 69% of cases of DRESS 
identified with Takeda PPIs. 67 (97%) of those cases were 
classified as serious, 2 (3%) were considered non-serious. 
There were no cases of positive rechallenge for 
pantoprazole. However, re-challenge tests to ascertain the 
link between DRESS and any drug is particularly 
problematic, as reintroduction of the culprit drug in patients 
may result in fatality. This would explain why so few cases 
of re-challenge for this PT have been recorded. A 
postulated mechanism in the literature such as hapten, 
prohapten, and the p– i concept may play roles in the 
pathogenesis of these reactions. 48% of reported DRESS 
events appeared within 2 to 6 weeks following treatment 
with pantoprazole (and/or lansoprazole), which is 
consistent with the recognized pathophysiology of the 
disease. Pantoprazole have a significant number of reports 
for DRESS. 
DRESS is an established important identified risk 
documented umbrella term of SCAR in the pantoprazole 
RMP.

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and

considered that the benefit risk profile of non-prescription 
Pantoprazole continues to be favourable in the treatment of 
short-term reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. 
Posology 
Treatment (including routine prophylaxis) with bypassing agents (e.g. activated prothrombin complex 
concentrate [aPCC] and activated recombinant human FVII [rFVIIa]) should be discontinued the day 
before starting Hemlibra therapy (see section 4.4). 
Factor VIII (FVIII) prophylaxis may be continued for the first 7 days of Hemlibra treatment. 
The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks (loading dose), followed by a 
maintenance dose from week 5, of either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 
6 mg/kg every four weeks, all doses administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
The loading dose regimen is the same, irrespective of the maintenance dose regimen. 
The maintenance dose regimen should be selected based on physician and patient/caregiver dosing 
regimen preference to support adherence. 
The patient dose (in mg) and volume (in mL) should be calculated as follows: 
● 
● 
Loading dose (3 mg/kg) once weekly for the first 4 weeks:  
Patient bodyweight (kg) x dose (3 mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of emicizumab to be 
administered 
Followed by a maintenance dose from week 5, of either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every 
two weeks or 6 mg/kg every four weeks:  
Patient bodyweight (kg) x dose (1.5; 3 or 6 mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of emicizumab to be 
administered 
The total volume of Hemlibra to be injected subcutaneously is calculated as follows: 
Total amount (mg) of emicizumab to be administered ÷ vial concentration (mg/mL) = total volume of 
Hemlibra (mL) to be injected. 
Different Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in the same 
syringe when making up the total volume to be administered. 
A volume greater than 2 mL per injection should not be administered. 
Examples:  
Patient’s bodyweight of 16 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly: 
● 
Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 16 kg x 3 mg/kg = 48 mg of emicizumab needed for the 
loading dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 48 mg by 150 mg/mL: 48 mg 
of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.32 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be injected. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available. 
● 
● 
●  Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 16 kg x 1.5 mg/kg = 24 mg of emicizumab 
needed for the maintenance dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 24 mg by 30 mg/mL: 24 mg 
of emicizumab ÷ 30 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 30 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be injected once 
weekly. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available.  
● 
●

Patient’s bodyweight of 40 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 3 mg/kg every two weeks: 
● 
Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 40 kg x 3 mg/kg = 120 mg of emicizumab needed for the 
loading dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 120 mg by 150 mg/mL: 
120 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be 
injected. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available. 
● 
● 
●  Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 40 kg x 3 mg/kg = 120 mg of emicizumab needed 
for the maintenance dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 120 mg by 150 mg/mL: 
120 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 0.8 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be 
injected every two weeks. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available.  
● 
● 
Patient’s bodyweight of 60 kg, under a maintenance dose regimen of 6 mg/kg every four weeks: 
● 
Loading dose (first 4 weeks) example: 60 kg x 3 mg/kg = 180 mg of emicizumab needed for the 
loading dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 180 mg by 150 mg/mL: 
180 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 1.20 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be 
injected. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available.  
● 
● 
●  Maintenance dose (from week 5 on) example: 60 kg x 6 mg/kg = 360 mg of emicizumab needed 
for the maintenance dose. 
To calculate the volume to be administered divide calculated dose 360 mg by 150 mg/mL: 
360 mg of emicizumab ÷ 150 mg/mL = 2.4 mL of 150 mg/mL Hemlibra concentration to be 
injected every four weeks. 
Choose appropriate dose and volume from vial strengths available. 
● 
● 
Duration of treatment 
Hemlibra is intended for long-term prophylactic treatment.  
Dose adjustments during treatment  
No dose adjustments of Hemlibra are recommended. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If a patient misses a scheduled subcutaneous injection of Hemlibra, the patient should be instructed to 
take the missed dose as soon as possible, up to a day before the day of the next scheduled dose. The 
patient should then administer the next dose on the usual scheduled dosing day. The patient should not 
take two doses on the same day to make up for a missed dose. 
Special populations 
Paediatric 
No dose adjustments are recommended in paediatric patients (see section 5.2). There are no data in 
patients less than 1 year of age. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustments are recommended in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). There 
are no data in patients over 77 years old. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are recommended in patients with mild, renal or hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). There are limited data available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with moderate renal or 
hepatic impairment. Emicizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal or hepatic 
impairment 
Management in the perioperative setting 
The safety and efficacy of emicizumab have not been formally evaluated in the surgical setting. 
Patients have had surgical procedures without discontinuing emicizumab prophylaxis in clinical 
studies.  
If bypassing agents (e.g. aPCC and rFVIIa) are required in the perioperative period, please refer to the 
dosing guidance on the use of bypassing agents in section 4.4. If FVIII is required in the perioperative 
period, please refer to section 4.5. 
When monitoring a patient’s underlying haemostatic activity, please refer to section 4.4 for laboratory 
tests unaffected by emicizumab. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) 
The safety and efficacy of emicizumab in patients receiving ongoing immune tolerance induction have 
not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Hemlibra is for subcutaneous use only, and it should be administered using appropriate aseptic 
technique (see section 6.6). 
The injection should be restricted to the recommended injection sites: the abdomen, the upper outer 
arms and the thighs (see section 5.2).  
Administration of Hemlibra subcutaneous injection in the upper outer arm should be performed by a 
caregiver or healthcare professional. 
Alternating the site of injection may help prevent or reduce injection site reactions (see section 4.8). 
Hemlibra subcutaneous injection should not be administered into areas where the skin is red, bruised, 
tender or hard, or areas where there are moles or scars.  
During treatment with Hemlibra, other medicinal products for subcutaneous administration should, 
preferably, be injected at different anatomical sites. 
Administration by the patient and/or caregiver 
Hemlibra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. After proper training in 
subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject Hemlibra, or the patient’s caregiver may 
administer it, if their physician determines that it is appropriate.  
The physician and the caregiver should determine the appropriateness of the child self-injecting 
Hemlibra. However, self-administration is not recommended for children below 7 years of age. 
For comprehensive instructions on the administration of Hemlibra, see section 6.6 and package leaflet.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy associated with Hemlibra and aPCC 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were reported from a clinical study in patients receiving 
Hemlibra prophylaxis when on average a cumulative amount of >100U/kg/24 hours of aPCC for 
24 hours or more was administered (see section 4.8). Treatment for the TMA events included 
supportive care with or without plasmapheresis and haemodialysis. Evidence of improvement was 
seen within one week following discontinuation of aPCC and interruption of Hemlibra. This rapid 
improvement is distinct from the usual clinical course observed in atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome and classic TMAs, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (see section 4.8). One 
patient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of TMA and continued to be treated safely. 
Patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis should be monitored for the development of TMA when 
administering aPCC. The physician should immediately discontinue aPCC and interrupt Hemlibra 
therapy if clinical symptoms and/or laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as 
clinically indicated. Physicians and patients/caregivers should weigh the benefits and risks of 
resuming Hemlibra prophylaxis following complete resolution of TMA on a case-by-case basis. In 
case a bypassing agent is indicated in a patient receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, see below for dosing 
guidance on the use of bypassing agents. 
Caution should be used when treating patients who are at high risk for TMA (e.g. have a previous 
medical history or family history of TMA), or those who are receiving concomitant medicinal 
products known to be a risk factor for the development of TMA (e.g. ciclosporin, quinine, tacrolimus). 
Thromboembolism associated with Hemlibra and aPCC  
Serious thrombotic events were reported from a clinical study in patients receiving Hemlibra 
prophylaxis when on average a cumulative amount of >100U/kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or 
more was administered (see section 4.8). No cases required anticoagulation therapy. Following 
discontinuation of aPCC and interruption of Hemlibra, evidence of improvement or resolution was 
seen within one month (see section 4.8). One patient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of 
thrombotic event and continued to be treated safely.  
Patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis should be monitored for the development of 
thromboembolism when administering aPCC. The physician should immediately discontinue aPCC 
and interrupt Hemlibra therapy if clinical symptoms, imaging, and/or laboratory findings consistent 
with thrombotic events occur, and manage as clinically indicated. Physicians and patients/caregivers 
should weigh the benefits and risks of resuming Hemlibra prophylaxis following complete resolution 
of thrombotic events on a case-by-case basis. In case a bypassing agent is indicated in a patient 
receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, see below for dosing guidance on the use of bypassing agents. 
Guidance on the use of bypassing agents in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis 
Treatment with bypassing agents should be discontinued the day before starting Hemlibra therapy. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physicians should discuss with all patients and/or caregivers the exact dose and schedule of bypassing 
agents to use, if required while receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. 
Hemlibra increases the patient’s coagulation potential. The bypassing agent dose required may 
therefore be lower than that used without Hemlibra prophylaxis. The dose and duration of treatment 
with bypassing agents will depend on the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient’s clinical 
condition. Use of aPCC should be avoided unless no other treatment options/alternatives are available. 
If aPCC is indicated in a patient receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, the initial dose should not exceed 
50 U/kg and laboratory monitoring is recommended (including but not restricted to renal monitoring, 
platelet testing, and evaluation of thrombosis). If bleeding is not controlled with the initial dose of 
aPCC up to 50 U/kg, additional aPCC doses should be administered under medical guidance or 
supervision with consideration made to laboratory monitoring for the diagnosis of TMA or 
thromboembolism and verification of bleeds prior to repeated dosing. The total aPCC dose should not 
exceed 100 U/kg in the first 24-hours of treatment. Treating physicians must carefully weigh the risk 
of TMA and thromboembolism against the risk of bleeding when considering aPCC treatment beyond 
a maximum of 100 U/kg in the first 24-hours. 
In clinical studies, no cases of TMA or thrombotic events were observed with use of rFVIIa alone in 
patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. 
Bypassing agent dosing guidance should be followed for at least 6 months following discontinuation 
of Hemlibra prophylaxis (see section 5.2). 
Immunogenicity 
Development of neutralising anti-emicizumab antibodies with decreasing emicizumab concentration 
leading to loss of efficacy has been uncommonly observed during clinical studies (see sections 4.8 and 
5.1). Patients with clinical signs of loss of efficacy (e.g. increase in breakthrough bleeding events), 
should be promptly evaluated to assess the etiology and other therapeutic options should be considered 
if neutralising anti-emicizumab antibodies are suspected. 
Effects of emicizumab on coagulation tests 
Emicizumab restores the tenase cofactor activity of missing activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). 
Coagulation laboratory tests based on intrinsic clotting, including the activated clotting time (ACT), 
activated partial thromboplastin time (e.g. aPTT), measure the total clotting time including time 
needed for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa by thrombin. Such intrinsic pathway based tests will yield 
overly shortened clotting times with emicizumab, which does not require activation by thrombin. The 
overly shortened intrinsic clotting time will then disturb all single factor assays based on aPTT, such 
as the one stage FVIII activity assay (see section 4.4, Table 1). However, single factor assays utilising 
chromogenic or immuno-based methods are not affected by emicizumab and may be used to assess 
coagulation parameters during treatment, with specific considerations for FVIII chromogenic activity 
assays as described below. 
Chromogenic FVIII activity tests may be manufactured with either human or bovine coagulation 
proteins. Assays containing human coagulation factors are responsive to emicizumab but may 
overestimate the clinical haemostatic potential of emicizumab. In contrast, assays containing bovine 
coagulation factors are insensitive to emicizumab (no activity measured) and can be used to monitor 
endogenous or infused FVIII activity, or to measure anti FVIII inhibitors. 
Emicizumab remains active in the presence of inhibitors against FVIII and so will produce a false 
negative result in clotting based Bethesda assays for functional inhibition of FVIII. Instead, a 
chromogenic Bethesda assay utilising a bovine based FVIII chromogenic test that is insensitive to 
emicizumab may be used. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These two pharmacodynamic markers do not reflect the true haemostatic effect of emicizumab in vivo 
(aPTT is overly shortened and reported FVIII activity may be overestimated) but provide a relative 
indication of the pro-coagulant effect of emicizumab. 
In summary, intrinsic pathway clotting-based laboratory test results in patients treated with Hemlibra 
should not be used to monitor its activity, determine dosing for factor replacement or anti-coagulation, 
or measure FVIII inhibitors titers. Caution should be taken if intrinsic pathway clotting based 
laboratory tests are used, as misinterpretation of their results may lead to under-treatment of patients 
experiencing bleeding episodes, which can potentially result in severe or life-threatening bleeds.  
Laboratory tests affected and unaffected by emicizumab are shown in Table 1 below. Due to its long 
half-life, these effects on coagulation assays may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose (see 
section 5.2).

1For important considerations regarding FVIII chromogenic activity assays, see section 4.4. 
Paediatric population 
There are no data in children < 1 year of age. The developing haemostatic system in neonates and 
infants is dynamic and evolving, and the relative concentrations of pro- and anticoagulant proteins in 
these patients should be taken into consideration when making a benefit-risk assessment, including 
potential risk of thrombosis (e.g. central venous catheter-related thrombosis). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No adequate or well-controlled interaction studies have been conducted with emicizumab.  
Clinical experience indicates a medicinal product interaction exists with emicizumab and aPCC (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
There is a possibility for hypercoagulability with rFVIIa or FVIII with emicizumab based on 
preclinical experiments. Emicizumab increases coagulation potential, therefore the FVIIa or FVIII 
dose required to achieve haemostasis may be lower than when used without Hemlibra prophylaxis. 
In case of thrombotic complication, the physician should consider discontinuing rFVIIa or FVIII and 
interrupt Hemlibra prophylaxis as clinically indicated. Further management should be tailored to the 
individual clinical circumstances. 
● 
Decision about dose modifications should take into account the half-life of medicinal products; 
specifically, interruption of emicizumab may not have an immediate effect. 
●  Monitoring using a FVIII chromogenic assay may guide the administration of coagulation 
factors, and testing for thrombophilic traits may be considered. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with aPCC or rFVIIa in patients 
receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis is limited. However, the possibility of thrombotic events should be 
considered when systemic anti-fibrinolytics are used in combination with aPCC or rFVIIa in patients 
receiving emicizumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential receiving Hemlibra should use effective contraception during, and 
for at least 6 months after cessation of Hemlibra treatment (see section 5.2). 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical studies of emicizumab use in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have 
not been conducted with Hemlibra. It is not known whether emicizumab can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Hemlibra should be used 
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus 
taking into account that, during pregnancy and after parturition, the risk for thrombosis is increased 
and that several pregnancy complications are linked to an increased risk for disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether emicizumab is excreted in human milk. No studies have been conducted to 
assess the impact of emicizumab on milk production or its presence in breast milk. Human IgG is 
known to be present in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or 
to discontinue/abstain from Hemlibra therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). No fertility data are available in humans. Thus, the effect of emicizumab on male 
and female fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Hemlibra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety profile of Hemlibra is based on data from clinical studies and post-marketing 
surveillance. The most serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported from the clinical studies with 
Hemlibra were thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thrombotic events, including cavernous sinus 
thrombosis (CST) and superficial vein thrombosis contemporaneous with skin necrosis (see below and 
section 4.4).  
The most common ADRs reported in ≥ 10% of patients treated with at least one dose of Hemlibra 
were: injection site reactions (19.4 %), arthralgia (14.2 %) and headache (14.0 %). 
In total three patients (0.7 %) in the clinical studies receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis withdrew from 
treatment due to ADRs, which were TMA, skin necrosis contemporaneous with superficial 
thrombophlebitis, and headache.

Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions 
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are based on data from post-marketing surveillance and 
pooled data from five phase III clinical studies (adult and adolescent studies [BH29884 - HAVEN 1, 
BH30071 – HAVEN 3, and BO39182 – HAVEN 4], an all-age group study [BO41423 – HAVEN 6], 
and a paediatric study [BH29992 - HAVEN 2]), in which a total of 444 patients with haemophilia A 
received at least one dose of Hemlibra as routine prophylaxis (see section 5.1). Three hundred and 
seven (69.1 %) of the clinical study participants were adults (of which two were female), 61 (13.7 %) 
were adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years), 71 (16.0 %) were children (≥ 2 to < 12 years) and five (1.1 %) 
were infants and toddlers (1 month to < 2 years). The median duration of exposure across the studies 
was 32 weeks (range: 0.1 to 94.3 weeks).  
ADRs from the phase III clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance are listed by MedDRA 
system organ class (Table 2). The corresponding frequency categories for each ADR are based on the 
following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to 
< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data).

Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
Thrombotic microangiopathy 
In pooled phase III clinical studies, TMA events were reported in less than 1 % of patients (3/444) and 
in 9.7 % of patients (3/31) who received at least one dose of aPCC while being treated with 
emicizumab. All 3 TMAs occurred when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/Kg/24 hours of 
aPCC for 24 hours or more was administered during a treatment event (see section 4.4). Patients 
presented with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury, 
without severe deficiencies in ADAMTS13 activity. One patient resumed Hemlibra following 
resolution of TMA without recurrence. 
Thrombotic events 
In pooled phase III clinical studies, serious thrombotic events were reported in less than 1 % of 
patients (2/444) and in 6.5 % of patients (2/31) who received at least one dose of aPCC while being 
treated with emicizumab. Both serious thrombotic events occurred when on average a cumulative 
amount of > 100 U/Kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or more was administered during a treatment 
event. One patient resumed Hemlibra following resolution of the thrombotic event without recurrence 
(see section 4.4).  
Characterization of the interaction between emicizumab and aPCC treatment in pivotal clinical 
studies  
There were 82 instances of aPCC treatment* in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis, of which 
eight instances (10%) consisted of on average a cumulative amount of >100 U/kg/24 hours of aPCC 
for 24 hours or more; two of the eight instances were associated with thrombotic events and three of 
the eight instances were associated with TMA (Table 3). No TMA or thrombotic events were 
associated with the remaining instances of aPCC treatment. Of all instances of aPCC treatment, 68 % 
consisted of only one infusion < 100 U/kg.

Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported very commonly (19.4 %) from the pooled phase III 
clinical studies. All ISRs observed in the Hemlibra clinical studies were reported as being non-serious 
and mild to moderate in intensity, and 94.9 % resolved without treatment. The most commonly 
reported ISR symptoms were injection site erythema (10.6 %), injection site pain (4.1 %), injection 
site pruritus (2.9 %) and injection site swelling (2.7 %).

Immunogenicity  
In the pooled phase III clinical studies with Hemlibra, development of neutralising anti-emicizumab 
antibodies associated with decreasing emicizumab concentration was uncommon (see section 5.1). 
One patient, who developed neutralising anti-emicizumab antibodies with decreasing emicizumab 
concentration, experienced loss of efficacy (manifest as breakthrough bleeding) after five weeks of 
treatment and later discontinued Hemlibra treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The paediatric population studied comprises a total of 137 patients, of which 5 (3.6 %) were infants 
and toddlers (1 month to less than 2 years of age), 71 (51.8 %) were children (from 2 to less than 
12 years of age) and 61 (44.5 %) were adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years old). The safety 
profile of Hemlibra was overall consistent between infants, children, adolescents, and adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience with overdose of Hemlibra. 
Symptoms 
Accidental overdose may result in hypercoagulability.  
Management 
Patients who receive an accidental overdose should immediately contact their physician and be 
monitored closely.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics; ATC code: B02BX06 
Mechanism of action 
Emicizumab is a humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a 
bispecific antibody structure. 
Emicizumab bridges activated factor IX and factor X to restore the function of missing FVIIIa that is 
needed for effective haemostasis. 
Emicizumab has no structural relationship or sequence homology to FVIII and, as such, does not 
induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to FVIII. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Prophylactic therapy with Hemlibra shortens the aPTT and increases the reported FVIII activity (using 
a chromogenic assay with human coagulation factors). These two pharmacodynamic markers do not 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reflect the true haemostatic effect of emicizumab in vivo (aPTT is overly shortened and reported FVIII 
activity may be overestimated) but provide a relative indication of the pro-coagulant effect of 
emicizumab. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A was evaluated in five 
clinical studies (three adult and adolescent studies in patients with haemophilia A with or without 
FVIII inhibitors [HAVEN 1, HAVEN 3, and HAVEN 4], a paediatric study in patients with 
haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors [HAVEN 2] and an all-age group study in patients with mild or 
moderate haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors [HAVEN 6]).  
Clinical studies in adult and adolescent patients with haemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors 
Patients (aged ≥ 12 years old and > 40 kg) with haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors (Study 
BH30071 – HAVEN 3) 
The HAVEN 3 study was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase III clinical study in 152 adult 
and adolescent males (aged ≥ 12 years and > 40 kg) with severe haemophilia A without FVIII 
inhibitors who previously received either episodic (“on demand”) or prophylactic treatment with 
FVIII. Patients received subcutaneous Hemlibra, 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks 
followed by either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly (Arms A and D) or 3 mg/kg every two weeks (Arm B) 
thereafter, or no prophylaxis (Arm C). Patients in Arm C could switch to Hemlibra (3 mg/kg every 
two weeks) after completing at least 24 weeks without prophylaxis. For Arms A and B dose up-
titration to 3 mg/kg weekly was allowed after 24 weeks for patients who experienced two or more 
qualified bleeds (i.e., spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state). Arm D 
patients could up-titrate after the second qualifying bleed. At the time of the primary analysis, five 
patients underwent up-titration of their maintenance dose. 
Eighty-nine patients previously treated with episodic (“on demand”) FVIII were randomized in a 2:2:1 
ratio to receive Hemlibra either once weekly (Arm A; N = 36), every two weeks (Arm B; N = 35) or 
no prophylaxis (Arm C; N = 18), with stratification by prior 24-week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9). Sixty-
three patients previously treated with prophylactic FVIII were enrolled into Arm D to receive 
Hemlibra (1.5 mg/kg once weekly). 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate in patients previously treated with episodic FVIII 
the efficacy of prophylactic Hemlibra weekly (Arm A) or every two weeks (Arm B) compared to no 
prophylaxis (Arm C) based on the number of bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors (see 
Table 4). Other objectives of the study included evaluation of the randomised comparison of Arms A 
or B and Arm C for the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds, 
spontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds, and target joint bleeds (see Table 4), as well as assessing patient 
treatment preference using a preference survey. 
The efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis was also compared with previous prophylactic FVIII treatment 
(Arm D) in patients who had participated in a non-interventional study (NIS) prior to enrollment (see 
Table 5). Only patients from the NIS were included in this comparison, because bleed and treatment 
data were collected with the same level of granularity as used in HAVEN 3. The NIS is an 
observational study with the main objective of capturing detailed clinical data on the bleeding episodes 
and haemophilia medicinal product use of patients with haemophilia A outside of an interventional 
study setting. 
Patients (aged ≥ 12 years old) with haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors (Study BH29884 – HAVEN 1) 
The HAVEN 1 study was a randomised, multicentre, open-label clinical study in 109 adolescent and 
adult males (aged ≥ 12 years old) with haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who had previously 
received either episodic or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents (aPCC and rFVIIa). In the 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study, patients received weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis (Arms A, C, and D) — 3 mg/kg once weekly 
for four weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly thereafter — or no prophylaxis (Arm B). Patients 
randomised to Arm B could switch to Hemlibra prophylaxis after completing at least 24 weeks 
without prophylaxis. Dose up-titration to 3 mg/kg once weekly was allowed after 24 weeks on 
Hemlibra prophylaxis for patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds (i.e., spontaneous 
and verified clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state). At the time of the primary analysis, 
two patients underwent up-titration of their maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg once weekly.  
Fifty-three patients previously treated with episodic (“on-demand”) bypassing agents were randomised 
in a 2:1 ratio to receive Hemlibra prophylaxis (Arm A) or no prophylaxis (Arm B), with stratification 
by prior 24-week bleed rate (< 9 or ≥ 9). 
Forty-nine patients previously treated with prophylactic bypassing agents were enrolled in Arm C to 
receive Hemlibra prophylaxis. Seven patients previously treated with episodic (“on-demand”) 
bypassing agents who had participated in the NIS prior to enrolment but were unable to enroll in 
HAVEN 1 prior to the closure of Arms A and B were enrolled in Arm D to receive Hemlibra 
prophylaxis.  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate, among patients previously treated with episodic 
(“on-demand”) bypassing agents, the treatment effect of weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis compared with 
no prophylaxis (Arm A vs. Arm B) on the number of bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation 
factors over time (minimum of 24 weeks or date of discontinuation) (see Table 6). Other secondary 
objectives of the randomised comparison of Arms A and B were the efficacy of weekly Hemlibra 
prophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds and target joint 
bleeds (see Table 6), as well as assessing patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health 
status (see Tables 10 and 11). The mean exposure time (+SD) for all patients on study was 
21.38 weeks (12.01). For each treatment arm, the mean exposure times (+SD) were 28.86 weeks 
(8.37) for Arm A, 8.79 (3.62) for Arm B, 21.56 (11.85) for Arm C and 7.08 (3.89) for Arm D. One 
patient in Arm A withdrew from study prior to initiation of Hemlibra. 
The study also evaluated the efficacy of weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis compared with previous 
episodic (on-demand) and prophylactic bypassing agents (separate comparisons) in patients who had 
participated in the NIS prior to enrolment (Arms A and C, respectively) (see Table 7).  
Patients (aged ≥ 12 years old) with haemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors (Study 
BO39182 – HAVEN 4) 
Hemlibra was investigated in a single arm, multicentre, phase III clinical study in 41 adult and 
adolescent males (aged ≥ 12 years and > 40 kg) who have haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors or 
severe haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (“on demand”) 
or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents or FVIII. Patients received Hemlibra prophylaxis – 
3 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks thereafter. The primary 
objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis given every four weeks in 
maintaining adequate bleed control, based on treated bleeds. Other objectives were to evaluate the 
clinical efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis on all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds 
and treated target joint bleeds (see Table 8). Patient treatment preference was also assessed using a 
preference survey. 
Patients (all ages) with mild or moderate haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors (Study BO41423 – 
HAVEN 6) 
The HAVEN 6 study was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase III clinical study in 
71 emicizumab-treated patients (all ages) with mild (n = 20 [28.2%]) or moderate (n = 51 [71.8%]) 
haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors for whom prophylaxis was indicated, as assessed by the 
investigator. Most patients were male (69 patients [97.2%]), and 2 were female (2.8%). At study entry, 
34 patients (47.9%) were on episodic and 37 patients (52.1%) were on prophylactic treatment with 
FVIII. Patients received subcutaneous Hemlibra 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
followed by patient preference for one of the following maintenance regimens, from week 5: 
1.5 mg/kg once weekly (n = 24 [33.8%]), 3 mg/kg every two weeks (n = 39 [54.9%]) or 6 mg/kg every 
four weeks (n = 8 [11.3%]). Dose up-titration to 3 mg/kg weekly was allowed after 24 weeks for 
patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds (i.e., spontaneous and clinically significant 
bleeds occurring at steady state). At the time of interim analysis, no patients underwent up-titration of 
their maintenance dose.  
The primary efficacy objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis 
based on the number of bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors over time (i.e., bleed rate 
of treated bleeds, see Table 9). Other objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of Hemlibra prophylaxis 
based on the number of all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds, and target joint bleeds over time, 
as well as assessing patient reported HRQoL using the Comprehensive Assessment Tool of Challenges 
in Haemophilia (CATCH) questionnaire over time.

Although a higher adherence was observed with emicizumab prophylaxis than with prior FVIII

according to standard label requirements could be identified (data to be interpreted with caution due to 
small sample sizes). 
Due to the short half-life of FVIII, no carryover effect is assumed after its discontinuation.  
Only the first five emicizumab doses had to be administered under supervision to ensure safety and 
injection technique proficiency. Similar to FVIII prophylaxis, self-administration at home was allowed 
for all subsequent emicizumab doses.   
All patients were treated by haemophilia experts who confirmed that adequate FVIII prophylaxis was 
administered to patients included in the intra-patient comparison, supporting equivalent usual prophylaxis 
care across sites and patients.

Health-related outcome measures 
The HAVEN clinical studies evaluated HRQoL and health-status using clinical outcome assessment 
measures. HAVEN 1 and 2 used the Haemophilia-Specific Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) 
questionnaire for adults (> 18 years) and its adolescent version (Haemo-QoL-SF, for 8 to <18 years), 
respectively, for which the Physical Health Score (i.e. painful swellings, presence of joint pain, pain 
with movement, difficulty walking far and needing more time to get ready) and Total Score (summary 
of all scores) were protocol defined endpoints of interest. HAVEN 2 additionally used the Adapted 
InhibQoL with Aspects of Caregiver Burden questionnaire to obtain caregiver-report of HRQoL in 
paediatric patients < 12 years. HAVEN 6 assessed HRQoL in adult and paediatric patients, as well as 
caregivers of paediatric patients, using the Comprehensive Assessment Tool of Challenges in 
Haemophilia (CATCH) questionnaire. The domains of risk perception and impact of haemophilia on 
daily activities, social activities, recreational activities, and work/school, as well as preoccupation and 
treatment burden were examined. To measure change in health status, the Index Utility Score (IUS) 
and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from the EuroQoL Five-Dimension Five-Levels Questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-5L) were examined. 
HAVEN 1 health-related outcomes 
In this study baseline Total Scores (mean = 41.14 and 44.58, respectively) and Physical Health scale 
scores (mean = 52.41 and 57.19, respectively) were similar for Hemlibra prophylaxis and no 
prophylaxis. Table 10 provides a summary of the comparison between the Hemlibra prophylaxis arm 
(Arm A) and the no prophylaxis arm (Arm B) on the Haem-A-QoL Total Score and Physical Health 
scale after 24 weeks of treatment adjusting for baseline. Weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis showed a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement compared with no prophylaxis in the 
pre-specified endpoints of Haem-A-QoL Physical Health Scale score at the Week 25 assessment.

HAVEN 6 health-related outcomes 
In HAVEN 6, HRQoL for patients of all ages with moderate haemophilia A was evaluated at week 25 
based on the CATCH questionnaire. The CATCH questionnaire (version 1.0) is a validated instrument 
that assesses the effect of haemophilia and its treatment. Different versions of the questionnaire exist 
for adult patients, paediatric patients and caregivers of paediatric patients. 
Health-related quality of life on Hemlibra prophylaxis remained generally stable, with improvement in 
the treatment burden domain of CATCH consistently observed across respondent groups.   
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients (age < 12 years old, or 12 to 17 years old weighing < 40 kg) with haemophilia A 
with FVIII inhibitors (Study BH29992 – HAVEN 2) 
Hemlibra weekly prophylaxis was evaluated in a single-arm, multicentre, open-label clinical study in 
paediatric patients (age < 12 years old, or 12 to 17 years old weighing < 40 kg) with haemophilia A 
with FVIII inhibitors. Patients received Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 
4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly thereafter.  
The study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy including the efficacy of weekly 
Hemlibra prophylaxis compared with previous episodic and prophylactic bypassing agent treatment in 
patients who had participated in the NIS prior to enrolment (intra-patient comparison). 
Efficacy results 
HAVEN 2 (interim analysis) 
At the time of the interim analysis, efficacy was evaluated in 59 patients who were < 12 years old and 
had been receiving weekly Hemlibra prophylaxis for at least 12 weeks, including four patients aged 
< 2 years old, 17 patients aged 2 to < 6 years, 38 patients aged 6 to < 12 years old. Annualised bleed 
rate and percent of patients with zero bleeds were calculated (see Table 12). The median observation 
time for these patients was 29.6 weeks (range: 18.4 to 63.0 weeks).

Although a higher adherence was observed with emicizumab prophylaxis than with prior bypassing agent 
(BPA) prophylaxis, no difference in ABR in patients with ≥ 80% or < 80% compliant doses on BPA 
prophylaxis according to standard label requirements could be identified (data to be interpreted with caution 
due to small sample sizes). 
Due to the short half-life of bypassing agents, no carryover effect is assumed after its discontinuation. 
Only the first five emicizumab doses had to be administered under supervision to ensure safety and injection 
technique proficiency. Similar to BPA prophylaxis, self-administration at home was allowed for all subsequent 
emicizumab doses. 
Paediatric health-related outcomes results  
HAVEN 2 health-related outcomes 
In HAVEN 2, HRQoL for patients aged ≥ 8 to < 12 years was evaluated at week 25 based on the 
Haemo-QoL-SF questionnaire for children (see Table 14). The Haemo-QoL-SF is a valid and reliable 
measure of HRQoL. HRQoL for patients aged < 12 years was also evaluated at week 25 based on the 
Adapted InhibQoL with Aspects of Caregiver Burden questionnaire completed by caregivers (see 
Table 14). The Adapted InhibQoL is a valid and reliable measure of HRQoL.

There is limited experience with bypassing agent or FVIII use during surgeries and procedures. 
Bypassing agent or FVIII use during surgeries and procedures was determined by the investigator. 
In the event of breakthrough bleeding, patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis should be managed 
with available therapies. For bypassing agent guidance refer to section 4.4.  
Immunogenicity  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response in patients treated with 
emicizumab. A total of 739 patients were tested for anti-emicizumab antibodies in the pooled clinical 
studies. Thirty-six patients (4.9%) tested positive for anti-emicizumab antibodies. In 19 patients 
(2.6%), anti-emicizumab antibodies were neutralising in vitro. Of these 19 patients, the neutralising 
anti-emicizumab antibodies did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics or 
efficacy of Hemlibra in 15 patients, while decreased emicizumab plasma concentrations were 
observed in four patients (0.5%). One patient (0.1%) with neutralising anti-emicizumab antibodies and 
decreased emicizumab plasma concentrations experienced loss of efficacy after five weeks of 
treatment and discontinued Hemlibra. Overall, the safety profile of Hemlibra was similar between 
those patients with anti-emicizumab antibodies (including neutralising antibodies) and those without 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Elderly population 
Use of Hemlibra in patients aged 65 and over with haemophilia A is supported by studies HAVEN 1, 
HAVEN 3, HAVEN 4 and HAVEN 6. Based on limited data, there is no evidence to suggest a 
difference in efficacy or safety in patients aged 65 years or above.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was determined via non-compartmental analysis in healthy 
subjects and using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 389 patients with 
haemophilia A. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration in haemophilia A patients, the absorption half-life was 
1.6 days.  
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following multiple subcutaneous administrations of 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks in 
haemophilia A patients, mean (±SD) trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab achieved 
52.6±13.6 µg/mL at Week 5. 
The predicted mean (±SD) Ctrough ,and Cmax and ratios of Cmax/Ctrough at steady- state for the 
recommended maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks or 6 mg/kg 
every four weeks are shown in Table 15 .

Similar PK profiles were observed following once weekly dosing (3 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks followed 
by 1.5 mg/kg/week) in adults/adolescents (≥ 12 years) and children (< 12 years) (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1:

In healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg was 
between 80.4% and 93.1% depending on the injection site. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were 
observed following subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh. Emicizumab 
can be administered interchangeably at these anatomical sites (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Following a single intravenous dose of 0.25 mg/kg emicizumab in healthy subjects, the volume of 
distribution at steady state was 106 mL/kg (i.e. 7.4 L for a 70-kg adult).  
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F), estimated from the population PK analysis, in haemophilia 
A patients following multiple subcutaneous doses of emicizumab was 10.4 L. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of emicizumab has not been studied. IgG antibodies are mainly catabolised by 
lysosomal proteolysis and then eliminated from or reused by the body. 
Elimination 
Following intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the total clearance of 
emicizumab was 3.26 mL/kg/day (i.e. 0.228 L/d for a 70-kg adult) and the mean terminal half-life was 
26.7 days. 
Following single subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, the elimination half-life was 
approximately 4 to 5 weeks. 
Following multiple subcutaneous injections in haemophilia A patients, the apparent clearance was 
0.272 L/day and the elimination apparent half-life was 26.8 days. 
Dose linearity 
Emicizumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in patients with haemophilia A after the 
first dose of Hemlibra over a dose range from 0.3 to 6 mg/kg . The exposure (Cavg, ss) of multiple doses 
is comparable between 1.5 mg/kg every week, 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and 6mg/kg dose every 4 weeks. 
Special populations 
Paediatric 
The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis which included 5 infants (≥ 1 month to < 2 years), 55 children (less 
than 12 years) and 50 adolescents (12 to < 18 years) with haemophilia A. Age did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of emicizumab in paediatric patients.  
Elderly 
The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab was assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis which included thirteen subjects aged 65 years and older (no subjects were 
older than 77 years of age). Relative bioavailability decreased with older age, but no clinically 
important differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab between subjects 
< 65 years and subjects ≥ 65 years.  
Race 
Population pharmacokinetics analyses in patients with haemophilia A showed that race did not affect 
the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. No dose adjustment is required for this demographic factor.   
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender 
Data in female patients are too limited for conclusion.  
Renal impairment 
No dedicated studies of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have 
been conducted.  
Most of the patients with haemophilia A in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal 
function (N = 332; creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 90 mL/min) or mild renal impairment (N = 27; CLcr 
of 60-89 mL/min). Mild renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab. There 
are limited data available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with moderate renal impairment (only 2 
patients with CLcr of 30-59 mL/min) and no data in patients with severe renal impairment. The impact 
of moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab cannot be 
concluded. 
Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism rather than renal excretion and a 
change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated studies on the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab have 
been conducted. Most of the patients with haemophilia A in the population pharmacokinetic analysis 
had normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, N = 300) or mild hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin from 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST, N = 51). Only 
6 patients had moderate hepatic impairment (1.5 × ULN <  bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN and any AST). Mild 
hepatic impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab (see section 4.2). The safety 
and efficacy of emicizumab have not been specifically tested in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were included in clinical studies. No data are 
available on the use of Hemlibra in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and cleared via catabolism rather than hepatic metabolism and 
a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with hepatic impairment. 
Other special populations 
Modelling shows that less frequent dosing in patients with hypoalbuminemia and low body weight for 
their age results in lower emicizumab exposures; simulations indicate that these patients would still 
benefit from clinically meaningful bleed control. No patients with such characteristics were enrolled in 
clinical studies. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on studies of acute and repeated dose 
toxicity, including safety pharmacology endpoints and endpoints for reproductive toxicity.  
Fertility 
Emicizumab did not cause any changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus 
monkeys up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg/week (equivalent to 11 times the human exposure 
at the highest dose of 3 mg/kg/week, based on AUC).

Teratogenicity 
No data are available with respect to potential side effects of emicizumab on embryo-foetal 
development.  
Injection site reactions 
Reversible haemorrhage, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, degeneration/necrosis of subcutis 
and swelling of endothelium in the subcutis was noted in animals after subcutaneous injection.

D.  CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
● 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities 
and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
● 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
●  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
● 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to launch of Hemlibra in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at increasing communication and medical and patient education 
around the important identified risks of thromboembolic events and thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TMA) associated with the concomitant use of emicizumab and activated prothrombin complex 
concentrate (aPCC), and the important potential risk of life-threatening bleeding due to 
misinterpretation of the standard coagulation tests (unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab) and 
provide information on how to manage them. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Hemlibra is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals, patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use Hemlibra, and laboratory 
professionals, have access to/are provided with the following educational package: 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Physician educational material 
Patient/Carer educational material 
Laboratory professionals educational material 
Patient Card 
The physician educational material should contain: 
The Summary of Product Characteristics  
● 
Guide for healthcare professionals 
● 
● 
The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
- 
Brief introduction to emicizumab (chemical class, mode of action, pharmacodynamics 
and indication) 
Relevant information (e.g. seriousness, severity, frequency, time to onset, reversibility as 
applicable) of the following safety concerns associated with the use of Hemlibra: 
- 
thromboembolic events associated with the concomitant use of emicizumab and 
aPCC,  
TMA associated with the concomitant use of emicizumab and aPCC 
life-threatening bleeding due to misinterpretation of the standard coagulation tests 
(unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab)  
- 
- 
- 
- 
Guidance on the use of bypassing agents concomitantly with emicizumab, including the 
following information: 
- 
Treatment with prophylactic bypassing agents should be discontinued the day 
before starting emicizumab therapy; 
Physicians should discuss with all patients and/or caregivers the exact dose and 
schedule of bypassing agents to use, if required while receiving emicizumab 
prophylaxis; 
- 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Emicizumab increases the patient’s coagulation potential and the dose and duration 
of treatment with bypassing agents may require adjustment depending on the 
location and extent of bleeding and on the patient’s clinical conditions; 
For all coagulation agents (aPCC, rFVIIa, FVIII, etc.), consideration should be 
given to verifying bleeds prior to repeated dosing; 
Use of aPCC should be avoided unless no other treatment options/alternatives are 
available and aPCC dosing recommendations in case aPCC is the only option. 
Treating physicians must carefully weigh the risk of TMA and thromboembolism 
against the risk of bleeding when considering aPCC treatment. 
Information on emicizumab’s interference with certain laboratory coagulation tests which 
will affect their reliability in the emicizumab setting and warning that these tests should 
not be used to monitor for emicizumab activity, determine need for factor replacement 
dosing, or measure FVIII inhibitors.  
Information on assays and methods not affected by emicizumab that may be used to 
assess coagulation parameters during treatment, with specific considerations for FVIII 
chromogenic activity assays; 
Listing of laboratory tests unaffected by emicizumab; 
Reminder that all patients receiving treatment with emicizumab should be given a Patient 
Card and reminded to carry it at all times and show it to any healthcare professionals who 
may treat them and to laboratory professionals that will perform their coagulation testing; 
Reminder to report any adverse events associated with the use of emicizumab.

Instructions for use 
1. 
What Hemlibra is and what it is used for 
What Hemlibra is 
Hemlibra contains the active substance “emicizumab”. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
“monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that recognise and bind to a 
target in the body. 
What Hemlibra is used for 
Hemlibra is a medicine used for treating patients of all ages with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency): 
● 
● 
who have developed factor VIII inhibitors  
who have not developed factor VIII inhibitors with: 
-  severe disease (the factor VIII blood level is less than 1%)  
-  moderate disease (the factor VIII blood level is from 1% to 5%) with severe bleeding 
phenotype. 
Haemophilia A is an inherited condition caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential substance 
required for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. 
The medicine prevents bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes in people with this condition. 
Some patients with haemophilia A can develop factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies against factor VIII) 
which stop the replacement factor VIII from working. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Hemlibra works 
Hemlibra restores the function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective blood 
clotting. Its structure is different from factor VIII, therefore Hemlibra is not affected by factor VIII 
inhibitors.  
2. 
What you need to know before you use Hemlibra  
Do not use Hemlibra 
● 
if you are allergic to emicizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Hemlibra. 
Warnings and precautions  
Before you start using Hemlibra, it is very important to talk to your doctor about using 
“bypassing agents” (medicines that help blood clot but which work in a different way from 
factor VIII). This is because treatment with bypassing agents may need to change while receiving 
Hemlibra. Examples of bypassing agents include activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) 
and recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa). Serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur when 
aPCC is used in patients who are also receiving Hemlibra:  
Potentially serious side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra  
● 
Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) 
This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  
- 
- 
When people have this condition, the lining of the blood vessels can be damaged and 
blood clots may develop in small blood vessels. In some cases, this can cause damage to the 
kidneys and other organs.  
- 
Be cautious if you are at high risk for this condition (have had this condition in the 
past, or a member of your family have suffered from it), or if you are taking medicines that 
can increase the risk of developing this condition, such as ciclosporin, quinine or tacrolimus. 
-

It is important to know the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy, in case you 
Stop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices 
any symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy. 
● 
In rare cases, a blood clot can form inside blood vessels and block them, which may

It is important to know the symptoms of such internal blood clots, in case they 
Stop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices 
any symptoms of blood clots in blood vessels.     
Other important information about Hemlibra  
● 
Antibody formation (immunogenicity) 
You may notice that bleeding is not being controlled with your prescribed dose of this 
- 
medicine. This could be due to the development of antibodies to this medicine. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices an increase in bleeds. Your doctor may 
decide to change your treatment if this medicine stops working for you.  
Children below the age of 1 year 
In children less than one year of age, the blood system is still developing. If your child is less than one 
year old, your doctor may prescribe Hemlibra only after carefully weighing the expected benefits and 
risks of using this product.  
Other medicines and Hemlibra 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
● 
Before you start using Hemlibra, talk to your doctor and carefully follow their 
Use aPCC only if no other treatment can be used. If aPCC is required, talk to your

- 
instructions on when to use a bypassing agent and the dose and schedule you should use.

required may be lower than the dose you used before starting Hemlibra.  
- 
doctor in case you feel you need a total of more than 50 units/kg of aPCC. For more 
information on using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra, see in section 2: “Potentially serious

- 
aPCC or rFVIIa in patients treated with Hemlibra, you should know that there may be a 
possibility of thrombotic events using anti-fibrinolytics administered intravenously in 
combination with aPCC or rFVIIa. 
Despite limited experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with 
Laboratory tests 
Tell your doctor if you are using Hemlibra before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your 
blood is clotting. This is because Hemlibra in the blood may interfere with some laboratory tests, 
leading to inaccurate results. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
● 
● 
You should use an effective method of birth control (contraception) during treatment with 
Hemlibra and for 6 months after your last injection of Hemlibra. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit of you taking Hemlibra against the risk to your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to use Hemlibra 
Hemlibra is provided in single-use vials as ready to use solution which does not need to be diluted. 
A doctor qualified to care for patients with haemophilia will start you on treatment with Hemlibra. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your healthcare provider if 
you are not sure.  
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keeping a record 
Each time you use Hemlibra, record the name and batch number of the medicine. 
How much Hemlibra to use 
The dose of Hemlibra depends on your weight and your doctor will calculate the amount (in mg) and 
corresponding amount of Hemlibra solution (in mL) to be injected: 
● 
● 
Loading dose regimen: Weeks 1 to 4: The dose is 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you 
weigh, injected once a week. 
Maintenance dose regimen: Week 5 and onwards: The dose is either 1.5 milligrams for every 
1 kilogram you weigh, injected once a week, 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, 
injected every 2 weeks, or 6 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, injected every 
4 weeks.  
The decision, to use either the 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 
four weeks maintenance dose, should be made in consultation with your doctor and, where applicable, 
with your caregiver. 
Different Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in a single 
injection when making up the total volume to be injected. 
The amount of Hemlibra solution given in each injection must not be more than 2 mL.  
How Hemlibra is given 
If you inject Hemlibra yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must 
carefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”. 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Hemlibra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Hemlibra. 
Once you have been trained, you should be able to inject this medicine at home, by yourself or 
with the help of a caregiver.  
To correctly insert the needle under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the clean injection 
site with your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject under the skin 
(into fatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injecting into a muscle could cause 
discomfort. 
Prepare and give the injection in clean and germ-free conditions using aseptic technique. Your 
doctor or nurse will give more information about this. 
Where to inject Hemlibra  
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Your doctor will show you which areas of the body are suitable for injecting Hemlibra.  
The recommended places to give an injection are: the front of the waist (lower abdomen), 
upper outer arms, or the front of the thighs. Use only recommended places for injection.  
For each injection, use a different area of the body to the one you used last time.  
Do not give injections where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or areas where there are 
moles or scars. 
When using Hemlibra, any other medicine injected under the skin should be given in a 
different area. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using syringes and needles 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
A syringe, a transfer needle with 5 micrometre filter, and an injection needle are used to draw 
up the Hemlibra solution from the vial into the syringe and to inject it under the skin.  
Syringes, transfer needles with filter and injection needles are not provided in this pack. For 
more information, see in section 6 “What is needed for Hemlibra administration and is not 
contained in this pack”.  
Make sure that you use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after a 
single use. 
A 1 mL syringe should be used for an injection up to 1 mL of Hemlibra solution. 
A 2 to 3 mL syringe should be used for an injection greater than 1 mL and up to 2 mL of 
Hemlibra solution. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Hemlibra can be used in adolescents and children of all ages.  
● 
A child can self-inject the medicine provided the child’s healthcare provider and the parent or 
caregiver agree. Self-injection for children below the age of 7 years is not recommended.  
If you use more Hemlibra than you should 
If you use more Hemlibra than you are supposed to, tell your doctor immediately. This is because you 
may be at risk of developing side effects such as blood clots. Always use Hemlibra exactly as your 
doctor has told you, and check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
If you forget to use Hemlibra 
● 
● 
If you forget your scheduled injection, inject the forgotten dose as soon as possible before the 
day of the next scheduled dose. Then, continue to inject the medicine as scheduled. Do not 
inject two doses on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you stop using Hemlibra 
Do not stop using Hemlibra without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Hemlibra, you may no 
longer be protected against bleeding. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

PREPARATION 
Step 1. Remove vial cap and clean top 
•  Take the cap off the vial(s). 
•  Throw away the vial cap(s) into the sharps disposal 
container. 
•  Clean the top of the vial(s) stopper with an alcohol 
wipe.  
Step 2. Attach transfer needle with filter to 
syringe 
•  Push and twist the transfer needle with 
filter clockwise on to the syringe until it is fully 
attached. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3. Uncap transfer needle 
Step 4. Inject air into vial 
•  Slowly pull back on the plunger and draw air 
into the syringe that is the same amount as your 
prescribed dose. 
•  Hold the syringe by the barrel with the 
transfer needle pointing up. 
•  Carefully pull the transfer needle cap 
straight off and away from your body. Do not 
throw the cap away. Place the transfer needle 
cap down on a clean flat surface. You will 
need to recap the transfer needle after 
transferring the medicine. 
•  Do not touch the needle tip or place it on a 
surface after the needle cap has been removed. 
•  Keep the vial on the flat working surface and 
insert the transfer needle and syringe straight 
down into the centre of the vial stopper. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5. Transfer medicine to syringe 
•  Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial 
upside down. 
•  With the needle pointing upwards, push on 
the plunger to inject the air from the syringe 
above the medicine. 
•  Keep your finger pressed down on the 
syringe plunger. 
•  Do not inject air into the medicine as this 
could create air bubbles or foam in the medicine. 
•  Slide the tip of the needle down so that it is 
within the medicine. 
•  Slowly pull back the plunger to prevent air 
bubbles/foam. 
Fill the syringe with more than the amount of 
medicine needed for your prescribed dose. 
•  Be careful not to pull the plunger out of the 
syringe. 
Important: If your prescribed dose is more than 
the amount of medicine in the vial, withdraw 
all of the medicine and go to the “Combining 
Vials” section now. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 6. Remove air bubbles 
•  Keep the needle in the vial and check the 
syringe for larger air bubbles. Large air bubble 
can reduce the dose you receive. 
•  Remove the larger air bubbles by gently 
tapping the syringe barrel with your fingers until 
the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. 
Move the tip of the needle above the medicine 
and slowly push the plunger up to push the air 
bubbles out of the syringe. 
• 
If the amount of medicine in the syringe is 
now at or below your prescribed dose, move the 
tip of the needle to within the medicine and 
slowly pull back the plunger until you have 
more than the amount of medicine needed for 
your prescribed dose. 
•  Be careful not to pull the plunger out of the 
syringe. 
•  Repeat the steps above until you have 
removed the larger air bubbles. 
Note: Ensure you have enough medicine in the 
syringe to complete your dose before moving 
onto the next step. If you cannot remove all 
medicine, turn the vial upright to reach the 
remaining amount. 
 Do not use the transfer needle to inject medicine as this may cause pain and bleeding.

1. 
What Hemlibra is and what it is used for 
What Hemlibra is 
Hemlibra contains the active substance “emicizumab”. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
“monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that recognise and bind to a 
target in the body. 
What Hemlibra is used for 
Hemlibra is a medicine used for treating patients of all ages with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency): 
● 
● 
who have developed factor VIII inhibitors  
who have not developed factor VIII inhibitors with: 
-  severe disease (the factor VIII blood level is less than 1%)  
-  moderate disease (the factor VIII blood level is from 1% to 5%) with severe bleeding 
phenotype. 
Haemophilia A is an inherited condition caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential substance 
required for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. 
The medicine prevents bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes in people with this condition. 
Some patients with haemophilia A can develop factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies against factor VIII) 
which stop the replacement factor VIII from working. 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Hemlibra works 
Hemlibra restores the function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective blood 
clotting. Its structure is different from factor VIII, therefore Hemlibra is not affected by factor VIII 
inhibitors.  
2. 
What you need to know before you use Hemlibra  
Do not use Hemlibra 
● 
if you are allergic to emicizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Hemlibra. 
Warnings and precautions  
Before you start using Hemlibra, it is very important to talk to your doctor about using 
“bypassing agents” (medicines that help blood clot but which work in a different way from 
factor VIII). This is because treatment with bypassing agents may need to change while receiving 
Hemlibra. Examples of bypassing agents include activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) 
and recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa). Serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur when 
aPCC is used in patients who are also receiving Hemlibra:  
Potentially serious side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra  
● 
Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) 
This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.  
- 
- 
When people have this condition, the lining of the blood vessels can be damaged and 
blood clots may develop in small blood vessels. In some cases, this can cause damage to the 
kidneys and other organs.  
- 
Be cautious if you are at high risk for this condition (have had this condition in the 
past, or a member of your family have suffered from it), or if you are taking medicines that 
can increase the risk of developing this condition, such as ciclosporin, quinine or tacrolimus.

Other important information about Hemlibra  
● 
Antibody formation (immunogenicity) 
You may notice that bleeding is not being controlled with your prescribed dose of this

medicine. This could be due to the development of antibodies to this medicine. 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices an increase in bleeds. Your doctor may 
decide to change your treatment if this medicine stops working for you.  
Children below the age of 1 year 
In children less than one year of age, the blood system is still developing. If your child is less than one 
year old, your doctor may prescribe Hemlibra only after carefully weighing the expected benefits and 
risks of using this product.  
Other medicines and Hemlibra 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

Laboratory tests 
Tell your doctor if you are using Hemlibra before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your 
blood is clotting. This is because Hemlibra in the blood may interfere with some laboratory tests, 
leading to inaccurate results. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
● 
● 
You should use an effective method of birth control (contraception) during treatment with 
Hemlibra and for 6 months after your last injection of Hemlibra. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit of you taking Hemlibra against the risk to your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.

How to use Hemlibra 
Hemlibra is provided in single-use vials as ready to use solution which does not need to be diluted. 
A doctor qualified to care for patients with haemophilia will start you on treatment with Hemlibra. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your healthcare provider if 
you are not sure.  
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keeping a record 
Each time you use Hemlibra, record the name and batch number of the medicine. 
How much Hemlibra to use 
The dose of Hemlibra depends on your weight and your doctor will calculate the amount (in mg) and 
corresponding amount of Hemlibra solution (in mL) to be injected: 
● 
● 
Loading dose regimen: Weeks 1 to 4: The dose is 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you 
weigh, injected once a week. 
Maintenance dose regimen: Week 5 and onwards: The dose is either 1.5 milligrams for every 
1 kilogram you weigh, injected once a week, 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, 
injected every 2 weeks, or 6 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, injected every 
4 weeks.  
The decision, to use either the 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 
four weeks maintenance dose, should be made in consultation with your doctor and, where applicable, 
with your caregiver. 
Different Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in a single 
injection when making up the total volume to be injected. 
The amount of Hemlibra solution given in each injection must not be more than 2 mL.  
How Hemlibra is given 
If you inject Hemlibra yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must 
carefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”. 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Hemlibra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Hemlibra. 
Once you have been trained, you should be able to inject this medicine at home, by yourself or 
with the help of a caregiver.  
To correctly insert the needle under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the clean injection 
site with your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject under the skin 
(into fatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injecting into a muscle could cause 
discomfort. 
Prepare and give the injection in clean and germ-free conditions using aseptic technique. Your 
doctor or nurse will give more information about this. 
Where to inject Hemlibra  
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 
Your doctor will show you which areas of the body are suitable for injecting Hemlibra.  
The recommended places to give an injection are: the front of the waist (lower abdomen), 
upper outer arms, or the front of the thighs. Use only recommended places for injection.  
For each injection, use a different area of the body to the one you used last time.  
Do not give injections where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or areas where there are 
moles or scars.

1. 
PREPARATION 
Step 1. Remove vial cap and clean top 
•  Take the cap off the vial(s). 
•  Throw away the vial cap(s) into the sharps 
disposal container. 
•  Clean the top of the vial(s) stopper with an alcohol 
wipe.  
Step 2. Attach transfer needle with filter to 
syringe 
•  Push and twist the transfer needle with 
filter clockwise on to the syringe until it is fully 
attached. 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3. Uncap transfer needle 
Step 4. Inject air into vial 
•  Slowly pull back on the plunger and draw air 
into the syringe that is the same amount as your 
prescribed dose. 
•  Hold the syringe by the barrel with the 
transfer needle pointing up. 
•  Carefully pull the transfer needle cap 
straight off and away from your body. Do not 
throw the cap away. Place the transfer needle 
cap down on a clean flat surface. You will 
need to recap the transfer needle after 
transferring the medicine.

Step 5. Transfer medicine to syringe 
•  Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial 
upside down. 
•  With the needle pointing upwards, push on 
the plunger to inject the air from the syringe 
above the medicine. 
•  Keep your finger pressed down on the 
syringe plunger. 
•  Do not inject air into the medicine as this 
could create air bubbles or foam in the medicine. 
•  Slide the tip of the needle down so that it is 
within the medicine. 
•  Slowly pull back the plunger to prevent air 
bubbles/foam. 
Fill the syringe with more than the amount of 
medicine needed for your prescribed dose. 
•  Be careful not to pull the plunger out of the 
syringe. 
Important: If your prescribed dose is more than 
the amount of medicine in the vial, withdraw 
all of the medicine and go to the “Combining 
Vials” section now. 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 6. Remove air bubbles 
•  Keep the needle in the vial and check the 
syringe for larger air bubbles. Large air bubble 
can reduce the dose you receive. 
•  Remove the larger air bubbles by gently 
tapping the syringe barrel with your fingers until 
the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. 
Move the tip of the needle above the medicine 
and slowly push the plunger up to push the air 
bubbles out of the syringe. 
• 
If the amount of medicine in the syringe is 
now at or below your prescribed dose, move the 
tip of the needle to within the medicine and 
slowly pull back the plunger until you have 
more than the amount of medicine needed for 
your prescribed dose. 
•  Be careful not to pull the plunger out of the 
syringe. 
•  Repeat the steps above until you have 
removed the larger air bubbles. 
Note: Ensure you have enough medicine in the 
syringe to complete your dose before moving 
onto the next step. If you cannot remove all 
medicine, turn the vial upright to reach the 
remaining amount. 
 Do not use the transfer needle to inject medicine as this may cause pain and bleeding.

Note: You must use a new transfer needle with 
filter each time you withdraw medicine from 
a new vial. 
•  Push and twist a new transfer needle 
clockwise on to the syringe until it is fully 
attached. 
•  Slowly pull back the plunger and draw some 
air into the syringe.

Step D. Uncap transfer needle 
•  Hold the syringe by the barrel with the 
transfer needle cap pointing up. 
•  Carefully pull the transfer needle cap 
straight off and away from your body. Do not 
throw the cap away. You will need to recap the 
transfer needle after drawing up the medicine.  
•  Do not touch the needle tip.

Step E. Inject air into vial 
•  With the new vial on the flat working 
surface, insert the new transfer needle and 
syringe, straight down into the centre of the 
vial stopper. 
•  Keep the transfer needle in the vial and turn 
the vial upside down. 
•  With the needle pointing upwards, inject the 
air from the syringe above the medicine. 
•  Keep your finger pressed down on the 
syringe plunger. 
•  Do not inject air into the medicine as this 
could create air bubbles or foam in the 
medicine.

Step F. Transfer medicine to syringe 
•  Slide the tip of the needle down so that it is 
within the medicine. 
•  Slowly pull back the plunger to prevent air 
bubbles/foam.  
Fill the syringe barrel more than the amount of 
medicine needed for your prescribed dose.  
•  Be careful not to pull the plunger out of the 
syringe. 
Note: Ensure you have enough medicine in the 
syringe to complete your dose before moving onto 
the next steps. If you cannot remove all medicine, 
turn the vial upright to reach the remaining 
amount. 
        Do not use the transfer needle to inject medicine as this may cause harm such as pain and 
bleeding. 
Repeat steps A to F with each additional vial until you have more than 
your prescribed dose. Once completed, keep the transfer needle 
inserted in the vial and return to Step 6. Continue with the remaining 
steps.

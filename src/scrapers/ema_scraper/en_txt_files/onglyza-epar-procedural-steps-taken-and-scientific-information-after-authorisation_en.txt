Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC with regard to posology recommendations and 
warnings for use in elderly patients and patients with 
renal impairment, minor amendment of the existing 
patients, no dose adjustment is recommended based solely 
on age.  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild 
renal impairment. The dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg 
once daily in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment. Onglyza is not recommended for patients with 
end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis.

D1680L00002 (GENERATION), a study comparing 
saxagliptin with glimepiride in elderly patients.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

limited. Therefore, caution is warranted in these patients. 
In the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for 
hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the 
saxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo (see 
section 5.1). Additional analysis did not indicate a 
differential effect among NYHA classes. 
In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite did 
not inhibit CYP2C8. 
SAVOR was a cardiovascular outcome study conducted in 
16,492 patients with type II diabetes who had a history of, 
or were at risk for, cardiovascular events. Its results 
demonstrated that saxagliptin is non-inferior to placebo and 
does not induce an increased risk for cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal ischaemic 
stroke. 
GENERATION was a 52-week trial performed in 720 elderly 
patients. The purpose was to evaluate whether saxagliptin 
+ Metformin was superior to glimepiride + metformin on 
the primary endpoint of subjects reaching HbA1c < 7% 
without hypoglycaemia (confirmed or severe). There 
appeared to be no difference in responders. Glimepiride 
was more effective than saxagliptin in reducing HbA1c, but 
at the cost of more hypoglycaemia. Saxagliptin was less 
effective, but can still reduce HbA1c to some extent, and 
did not induce hypoglycaemia. Age appeared to be an 
important factor: results favoured saxagliptin in subjects < 
75, and glimepiride in subjects > 75 years.

and led to the extension of the indication of the product for 
the use as monotherapy in patients for whom metformin is 
inappropriate, triple oral therapy in combination with 
metformin plus a sulphonylurea, and combination therapy 
with insulin. There is no evidence of any subgroup 
differential benefit for any of the treatments. Since the 
initial Marketing Authorisation the product information has 
been updated with information on hypersensitivity 
reactions, pancreatitis, nausea, dermatitis, pruritus and 
abdominal pain. The benefit-risk balance of Onglyza in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes remains favourable and 
therefore the renewal of the marketing authorisation with 
unlimited validity is recommended.

Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated with new 
4.4 of the SmPC in order to add a warning on 
pancreatitis as well as update of section 4.8 with 
regard to additional adverse reactions (nausea, 
pancreatitis, dermatitis, pruritus). The Package 
Leaflet was updated in accordance.

45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
information based largely on accumulated case reports of 
Onglyza. 
Case reports of patients with nausea who experienced a 
positive rechallenge with Onglyza were indicative of a 
causal relationship, and since nausea can be expected to 
occur with saxagliptin since ‘vomiting’ is a listed reaction, 
nausea is now included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The 
frequency of nausea has been calculated based on an 
analysis of clinical trial data with a frequency in all 
saxagliptin treatment groups of 2.2% (common). 
Page 19/25
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pancreatitis has been reported infrequently with the use of 
Onglyza. However, although there have been confounding 
co-medications and/or underlying diseases, in several 
patients signs of pancreatitis occurred after start of 
saxagliptin and resolved after discontinuation, suggestive of 
a causal relationship. Moreover, pancreatitis has been 
recognized as an adverse event for other DPP-4 inhibitors. 
Therefore, information about pancreatitis is now included in 
the SmPC in section 4.4 as a warning and in section 4.8 to 
include pancreatitis as adverse reaction, with the frequency 
“uncommon”. 
Dermatitis and pruritus are now included as adverse 
reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC, with the frequencies 
of these reactions calculated based on a pooled analysis of 
clinical trial data. The frequency of dermatitis in all 
saxagliptin treatment groups was 0.3% (uncommon). The 
frequency of pruritus in all saxagliptin treatment groups 
was 0.7% (uncommon). This followed the more detailed 
analysis of cumulative data of skin reactions (erythema, 
eczema, rash, allergic dermatitis).

18 weeks, saxagliptin was non-inferior to sitagliptin in 
mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c in both 
the per-protocol and the full analysis sets . The reductions 
from baseline in HbA1c respectively for 
saxagliptin and sitagliptin in the primary per-protocol 
analysis were -0.5% (mean and median) and 
-0.6% (mean and median). In the confirmatory full analysis 
set, mean reductions were -0.4% and

52 weeks, the saxagliptin and glipizide groups had similar 
mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c in the per-protocol 
analysis (-0.7% vs. -0.8%, respectively, mean baseline 
HbA1c of 7.5% for both groups). The intent-to-treat 
analysis showed consistent results. The reduction in FPG 
was slightly, less in the saxagliptin-group and there were 
more discontinuations (3.5% vs 1.2%) due to lack of 
efficacy based on FPG criteria during the first 24 weeks of 
the study. Saxagliptin also resulted in a significantly lower 
proportion of patients with hypoglycaemia, 3% (19 events 
in 13 subjects) vs. 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) for 
glipizide. Patients treated with saxagliptin exhibited a 
significant decrease from baseline in body weight compared 
to a weight gain in patients administered glipizide (- 1.1 vs. 
+1.1 kg).

At the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation (MA) the

II, Labelling 
MAH committed to submit long-term data from the core 
a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
saxagliptin add-on to glibenclamide, a study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin add-on 
to thiazolidinedione therapy and a study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination 
with metformin as initial therapy. 
In addition the MAH made amendments in section 
5.1 of the SPC regarding the information on 
saxagliptin add-on to metformin therapy study. 
The MAH took the opportunity to update the SPC, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet in line with the latest 
and PL 
studies CV181040 (FUM 006), CV181013 (FUM 007) and 
CV181039 (FUM 009). These studies were conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin add-on to 
glibenclamide, saxagliptin add-on to thiazolidinedione 
therapy and saxagliptin in combination with metformin as 
initial therapy, respectively. 
The CHMP concluded for study CV181040 that the addition 
of saxagliptin to glyburide provided a sustained reduction in 
glycaemic parameters, including HBA1C and PPG, when 
compared with treatment with uptitrated glyburide, without 
an increase in hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic symptoms.

Saxagliptin was well tolerated. 
For study CV181013 the CHMP concluded that the results of 
the long-term analysis of this study demonstrate that the 
administration of saxagliptin as add on therapy to 
background treatment with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) with 
or without rescue with metformin for up to 76 weeks was 
well tolerated. The addition of saxagliptin to TZD provided a 
long term reduction in glycaemic parameters, including 
HBA1C, FPG, and PPG, when compared with treatment with 
a TZD alone, without an increase in hypoglycaemia or 
hypoglycaemic symptoms. 
For study CV181039 the CHMP concluded that the addition 
of saxagliptin to metformin provided a sustained reduction 
in glycaemic parameters, including HBA1C, FPG, and PPG, 
without an increase in hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic 
symptoms. The difference in change in HbA1C was 
statistically significant compared to metformin, but the 
95% CI is wide and the clinical relevance debatable. 
The results of the long-term analysis of this study 
demonstrate that the administration of saxagliptin as initial 
combination therapy with metformin or as initial 
monotherapy for up t

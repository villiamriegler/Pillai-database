The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar 13 
and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
II. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) 
13vPnC contains saccharides from  pneumococcal  serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A,  6B,  7F,  9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria toxin cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197). 
The  vaccine  is  formulated  to  contain  2.2  μg  of  each  saccharide,  except  for  4.4  μg  of  6B  per  0.5-mL 
dose. The final formulation contains 5 mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, with 0.125 mg of 
aluminum as aluminum phosphate per 0.5-mL dose. 
Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
Wyeth  has  developed  Prevenar  13,  a  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC),  as  a 
successor  to  the  currently  registered  vaccine,  Prevenar,  for  use  in  infants  and  young  children  to 
prevent pneumococcal disease (invasive pneumococcal disease [IPD], nonbacteremic pneumonia, and 
acute  otitis  media  [AOM])  caused  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  contained  in  the  vaccine. 
Prevenar is a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) that contains serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 
18C, 19F, and 23F. In addition to these serotypes, 13vPnC contains serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. 
The MAH submitted final reports for:

Safety  data  collected  after  the  infant  series,  ie,  the  period  from  after  the  dose  3  blood  draw  to  the 
toddler  dose  vaccination  is  also  included.  A  review  of  these  additional  data  is  also  presented  in  this 
Module  2.5  addendum.  For  the  other  3  studies  (6096A1-006,  6096A1-500,  and  6096A1-501)  safety 
data from the 6-month follow-up period are presented, and once again it should be noted that both the 
infant series and toddler dose were submitted with the MAA. 
2. Clinical studies 
Study 6096A1-006: Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Toddler Report (Pivotal EU study):  
A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Double-Blind  Trial  of  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  and 
Immunologic  Non-inferiority  of  a  13-valent  Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine Compared to  a  7-valent 
Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  in  Healthy  Infants  Given  in  a  2-,  3-,  4-,  and  11-  to  12-Month 
Schedule With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations. 
Description 
Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original 
MAA procedure.  
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Demonstrate that the PnC serotype-specific IgG responses induced by 13vPnC are non-inferior to those 
induced by 7vPnC or 7vPnC reference measured 1 month after the infant series. 
Assess the non-inferiority of antigen-specific response (Dip, HBV, Hib) 1 month after dose 3 of PnC and 
concomitant vaccine in the 13vPnC group relative to the 7vPnC group 
  Study design 
This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to 
evaluate  the  immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  13vPnC  compared  with  7vPnC  in  healthy 
infants. The trial was conducted at 56 sites in Germany. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately  600  subjects  (300  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to 
achieve 270 evaluable subjects per group.  
 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  to  be  randomly  assigned  (in  a  1:1  ratio  prospectively)  to  receive  either  13vPnC  and 
Infanrix hexa or 7vPnC and Infanrix hexa given in a 2-, 3-, 4- (infant series) and 11- to 12- (toddler 
dose) month schedule. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
AEs were to be recorded on the eCRF based on ancillary information on the e-diary, clinical evaluation 
during a study visit, and verbal questioning of the parent about the child’s health since the last visit. 
AEs were recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 4 and from visit 5 to visit 6. 
At  visit  5,  any  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions  since  visit  4  were  recorded.  All  serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  recorded  from  the  signing  of  the  ICF  to  6  months  after  the  last  study 
vaccination. 
A  telephone  contact  was  to  be  made  6  months  after  the  last  study  vaccination  to  record  any  newly 
diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions,  hospitalizations,  SAEs,  and  other  reportable  information  (ORI) 
that occurred since the last study visit. 
  Statistical Methods 
The data are descriptive. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The  actual  number  of  vaccinated  subjects  was  603,  ie,  300  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  group  and  303 
subjects in the 7vPnC group. The actual number of subjects who completed the toddler dose of study 
vaccine was 574, ie, 289 subjects in the 13vPnC group and 285 subjects in the 7vPnC group (including 
Prevenar 13 P46 035

blood draw). A total of 578 subjects completed the 6-month follow-up, 288 in the 13vPnC  group and 
290 subjects in the 7vPnC group. 
The safety population for this report totaled 578 subjects. 
Of  these,  4  subjects  received  an  incorrect  vaccination  and  are  not  included  in  the  summary  tables 
(none of them had AEs). Subjects were analyzed according to the vaccine actually administered; thus, 
the summary table shows 574 subjects, 287 subjects in each of the vaccine groups. 
 
Efficacy results 
N.a. 
  Safety results 
AEs were reported for 20 (7.0%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 22 (7.7%) subjects in the 7vPnC 
group.  These  AEs  reflected  common  childhood  illnesses  and  accidents.  The  AEs  categorized  as 
infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most  frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups.  The  individual  AE 
with the highest incidence was gastroenteritis, which occurred in 6 subjects overall (3 subjects, 1.0%, 
in  each  of  the  2  vaccine  groups).  When  data  for  all  AEs  were  analyzed,  no  significant  differences 
between  vaccine  groups  were  noted.  Moreover,  none  of  the  AEs  were  considered  related  to  study 
vaccine. 
A  total  of  18  severe  AEs  were  reported  for  11  subjects  overall,  including  6  (2.1%)  subjects  in  the 
13vPnC group and 5 (1.7%) subjects in the 7vPnC group. The most frequently reported severe AE was 
gastroenteritis, which occurred in 2 (0.7%) subjects in each of the vaccine groups.  
SAEs were reported for 11 (3.8%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 14 (4.9%) subjects in the 7vPnC 
group. SAEs categorized as infections and infestations were reported most frequently in both vaccine 
groups. Of the individual SAEs, the highest incidence was for gastroenteritis, which was reported in 6 
subjects  overall  (3  subjects,  1.0%,  in  each  of  the  2  vaccine  groups).  There  were  no  significant 
differences between vaccine groups for SAEs, and none were considered related to study vaccine. None 
of the SAEs were life-threatening. 
There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The definition  of  severe  AEs  was  not  included  in  the  study  protocol,  other  than 
that  all  adverse  events  were  defined  as  mild  moderate  severe  or  life  threatening.  The  standard 
definition of Serious Adverse events (SAEs) was used. However, considering that none of the adverse 
events were considered related to the vaccine, this issue is of less importance. 
Study 6096A1-500: Final 6-Month Follow-up Addendum to Final Infant and Toddler Report: 
A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Active-Controlled,  Double-blind  Trial  Evaluating  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  and 
Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine 
Pediatric Vaccinations in Italy 
  Description 
Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original 
MAA procedure.  
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Demonstrate that the immune response after Infanrix hexa (antigen assessed: 
HBV)  and  13vPnC  is  non-inferior  to  the  response  after  Infanrix  hexa  and  7vPnC  measured  1  month 
after the toddler dose. 
Assess the immune response to 13vPnC measured 1 month after the infant series and just before the 
toddler dose. 
Assess  the  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  relative  to  7vPnC  measured  1  month  after  the 
toddler dose. 
  Study design

This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to 
evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  given  with  routine  pediatric 
vaccinations in healthy infants. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 600 subjects were to participate in this study at approximately 10 to 30 sites. Enrolled 
subjects  were  randomly  assigned  at  a  ratio  of  1:1  into  1  of  the  2  vaccine  groups  to  receive  either 
13vPnC + Infanrix hexa or 7vPnC + Infanrix hexa. Three hundred (300) subjects were to be enrolled in 
each vaccine group to obtain a final number of 225 evaluable subjects per group at the toddler dose. 
 
Treatments 
Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either  13vPnC or 7vPnC together with a concomitant 
dose (0.5 mL) of Infanrix hexa at each of the 3 vaccination visits.  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Each  subject’s  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  was  contacted  by  telephone  approximately  6  months  after 
the last study vaccination and asked to report any hospitalizations, serious adverse events (SAEs), or 
newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions that occurred since the last study visit. 
  Statistical Methods 
The data are descriptive. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
604 subjects received the first infant series dose, 589 received the second dose, and 569 received the 
toddler  dose.  Of  those  who  received  the  toddler  dose,  285  and  281  subjects  completed  the  toddler 
dose period in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. After the toddler dose interval, 2 subjects 
in the 7vPnC group were withdrawn from the study, so that 285 and 279 subjects completed the study. 
Because a telephone contact was to be attempted on all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination 
(regardless of the number of vaccinations), the numbers of subjects for the 6-month follow-up period 
were greater than the numbers of subjects completing the study. In the 13vPnC group, 290 subjects 
entered and all completed the 6-month follow-up. In the 7vPnC group, 288 subjects entered and 286 
subjects completed the 6-month follow-up. 
 
Efficacy results 
N.a. 
  Safety results 
AEs were reported for 21 subjects during the relevant period, 10 (3.3%) in the 13vPnC group and 11 
(3.6%)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  AEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most 
frequently in both vaccine groups. Of the individual AEs, the highest incidence was for gastroenteritis 
(4  [1.3%]  subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group)  and  febrile  convulsion  (2  [0.7%]  subjects  for  13vPnC  and  1 
[0.3%]  subject  for  7vPnC).  When  data  for  all  AEs  were  analyzed,  no  significant  differences  between 
vaccine  groups  were  noted  for  any  AE.  None  of  the  AEs  reported  were  considered  to  be  related  to 
study vaccine. 
Four (4) severe AEs were reported for 3 subjects in the 7vPnC group and none were reported for the 
13vPnC  group.  The  severe  AEs  included  atrioventricular  block,  bronchitis,  and  pneumonia.  No  life-
threatening AEs were reported. There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period. 
SAEs  were  reported  during  the  6  month  follow-up  period  for  20  subjects,  9  (3.0%)  in  the  13vPnC 
group  and  11  (3.6%)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  SAEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were 
reported most frequently in both vaccine groups. Of the individual SAEs, the highest incidence was for 
gastroenteritis  (4  [1.3%] subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group)  and  febrile  convulsion  (2  [0.7%]  subjects  for 
13vPnC  and  1  [0.3%]  subject  for  7vPnC).  As  with  the  AEs,  there  were  no  significant  differences 
between vaccine groups for SAEs and none of the SAEs were considered to be related to study vaccine.

Immunogenicity of a 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants Given With Routine 
Pediatric Vaccinations in Spain. 
  Description 
Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original 
MAA procedure.  
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Demonstrate that the immune response after Meningitec (antigen assessed: MnC by SBA) and 13vPnC 
is  non-inferior  to  response  after  Meningitec  and  7vPnC  measured  1  month  after  a  2-dose  Meningitec 
infant series. 
Assess the non-inferiority of antigen-specific response to PT, FHA, PRN, Dip, Tet, and polio types 1, 2, 
3 after Infanrix hexa and 13vPnC relative to Infanrix hexa and 7vPnC. 
Assess the immune responses to 13vPnC measured 1 month after dose 2 and 1 month after dose 3 of 
the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose. 
  Study design 
This  was  a  phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC in healthy infants. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately  600  subjects  (300  subjects  per  group)  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study  in  order  to 
achieve 270 evaluable subjects per group across 35 sites.  
 
Treatments 
Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC or 7vPnC together with 1 dose (0.5 mL) 
of  each  of  the  following  concomitant  vaccines:  Infanrix  hexa/Infanrix-IPV+Hib,  Meningitec,  and  MMR 
II. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Each  subject’s  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  was  contacted  by  telephone  approximately  6  months  after 
the  last  study  vaccination;  this  included  both  subjects  who  completed  the  study  and  those  who 
discontinued prematurely. They were asked to report any newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, 
hospitalizations,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and  other  reportable  information  that  had  occurred 
since the last study visit. 
  Statistical Methods 
The data are descriptive. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
619  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  study  vaccine;  616  subjects  received  the  first  infant  series 
dose, 605 received the second dose, 597 received the third dose, and 582 received the toddler dose. 
Five  hundred  seventy-nine  (579)  subjects  completed  the  toddler  dose  and  the  study.  Because  a 
telephone contact was to be attempted for all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination (regardless 
of the number of vaccinations), the numbers of subjects for the 6-month follow-up period were greater 
than the numbers of subjects completing the study. In the 13vPnC group, 299 subjects entered and all 
completed  the  6-month  follow-up.  In  the  7vPnC  group,  292  subjects  entered  and  289  subjects 
completed the 6-month follow-up. 
 
Efficacy results 
N.a. 
  Safety results 
AEs  were  reported  for  13  subjects  during  the  relevant  period,  6  (1.9%)  in  the  13vPnC  group  and  7 
(2.3%)  in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  AEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most 
frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups.  When  data  for  all  AEs  were  analyzed,  no  significant  differences

between vaccine groups were noted for any AE. None of the AEs reported were considered related to 
study  vaccine.  Most  of  the  AEs  reported  were  the  types  of  conditions  and  symptoms  expected  in 
infants  of  this  age.  Four  (4)  severe  AEs  were  reported  for  1  subject  (501-015-000813)  in  the  7vPnC 
group and none were reported for the 13vPnC group.  
There were no deaths reported during the 6-month follow-up period. 
SAEs were reported during this period for 9 subjects, 3 (1.0%) in the 13vPnC group and 6 (2.0%) in 
the  7vPnC  group.  SAEs  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  most  frequently  in 
both  vaccine  groups.  Of  the  individual  SAEs,  the  highest  incidence  in  the  13vPnC  group  was  for 
gastroenteritis  (2  subjects,  0.6%)  and  in  the  7vPnC  group  was  for  febrile  convulsion  (2  subjects, 
0.7%).  As  with  the  AEs,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  vaccine  groups  for  SAEs  and 
none of the SAEs were considered related to study vaccine.  
Study 6096A1-3005:  Final Toddler Report:  A Phase  3, Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-Blind 
Trial  Evaluating  The  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  3  lots  of  13-  Valent  Pneumococcal 
Conjugate Vaccine In Healthy Infants given with Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in The United States. 
  Description 
Only a brief description of the study will be included as it has already been assessed during the original 
MAA procedure. The immunogenicity and safety data from the toddler dose from Study 6096A1-3005 
are presented in the CSR submitted at this time, however it should be noted that the infant series data 
were  already  submitted  as  part  of  the  MAA.  This  present  CSR  also  includes  the  additional  non-
inferiority  comparison  of  the  anti-polysaccharide  IgG  responses  after  the  infant  series  that  were 
submitted in response to questions during review of the MAA. The safety data collected after the infant 
series  (ie,  the  period  from  after  the  dose  3  blood  draw  to  the  toddler  dose  vaccination)  are  also 
described. 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Demonstrate that the immune responses induced by 3 lots of 13vPnC are equivalent at 1 month after 
the infant series. 
Demonstrate the non-inferiority of immune response induced by Pediarix given with 13vPnC relative to 
Pediarix given with 7vPnC 1 month after the infant series (antigens assessed: Tet; polio types 1, 2, 3; 
HBV). (The results relating to this objective were assessed previously) 
The secondary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the immune responses induced by the 3 
lots of 13vPnC are equivalent when measured by serum IgG levels 1 month after the toddler dose. 
  Study design 
This  was  a  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  conducted  to 
evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  3  lots  of  13vPnC  in  healthy  infants  when 
coadministered with routine pediatric vaccinations. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 1645 subjects (470 subjects in the 13vPnC pilot scale lot 1 group, 470 subjects in the 
13vPnC  pilot  scale  lot  2  group,  470  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  manufacturing  scale  lot  group,  and  235 
subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group)  were  to  participate  in  this  study  at  approximately  85  sites,  to  achieve 
1400  evaluable  subjects  (400  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  pilot  scale  lot  1  group,  400  subjects  in  the 
13vPnC  pilot  scale  lot  2  group,  400  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  manufacturing  scale  lot  group,  and  200 
subjects in the 7vPnC group). 
 
Treatments 
All subjects were to receive 1 dose  (0.5 mL)  of  either 13vPnC or 7vPnC at each of the 4 vaccination 
visits along with a concomitant dose of Pediarix and Hib vaccine at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month visits, and 
with MMR, varicella, and hepatitis A vaccines at the 12-month visit according to their randomization.  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Blood  samples  (approximately  5  mL)  were  to  be  collected  at  visit  4  (28  to  42  days  after  the  infant 
series) and at visit 6 (28 to 42 days after the toddler dose), with a total volume of approximately 10 
mL of blood for the duration of the study.

For subjects in the 7vPnC and 13vPnC groups, serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 
13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined 
for each blood sample and expressed as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL).   
For each of the concomitant vaccine antigen responses described below, the assays were performed for 
all subjects in the 7vPnC group, and for an equal number of subjects from the 13vPnC groups: 
  Serum  levels  of  IgG  antibodies  to  tetanus  toxoid  were  measured  using  an  antitetanus  toxoid 
ELISA  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Results  were 
reported as international units per milliliter (IU/mL). 
  Serum  levels  of  antibody  to  poliovirus  (strains  1,  2,  and  3)  were  measured  using  a  polio  in 
vitro  plaque  neutralization  assay  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the 
infant series. Results were reported as antibody titers. 
  Serum levels of antibody to HBsAg  were measured using an FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic 
kit  and  performed  on  blood  samples  collected  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  Results  were 
reported as milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). 
  Statistical Methods 
The pneumococcal IgG serotype antibody concentrations were logarithmically transformed for analysis. 
Within  each  lot  and  for  each  antibody  concentration  separately,  geometric  means  of  the  antibody 
concentration  at  each  of  the  visits  were  calculated  and  rank  ordered  from  lowest  (1)  to  highest  (3). 
Two  (2)-sided,  95%  CIs  were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for  the  mean  of  the 
logarithmically  transformed  assay  results  computed  using  the  Student  t  distribution.  In  addition,  the 
ratio  of  the  GMCs  and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were  computed  to  aid  in  interpretation  of 
results. For the geometric mean ratio, the CIs were computed using the Student t distribution for the 
mean difference of the measures on the log scale (lowest relative to middle, lowest relative to highest 
and  middle  relative  to  highest).  To  evaluate  equivalency  among  the  3  lots,  the  equivalence  test  of 
Wiens and Iglewicz was used. 
For  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serum  IgG  ≥0.35 
µg/mL  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serum  IgG  ≥1.00  µg/mL  1  month  after  the  infant 
series  and  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  were  computed.  In  addition,  the  proportions  of  subjects 
achieving antibody concentration ≥0.15 μg/mL 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the 
toddler  dose  were  computed.  Exact,  unconditional,  2-sided,  95%  CIs  on  the  pairwise  difference  in 
proportions were calculated to aid in interpretation of results. The CIs were computed using the non-
inferiority procedure of Chan and Zhang, using the standardized test statistics and gamma=0.000001. 
To  evaluate  the  consistency  among  the  3  lots,  the  equivalence  test  of  Wiens  and  Iglewicz  was  used. 
The 3 lots of 13vPnC were to be considered equivalent if, for all 13 serotypes, the maximum difference 
between any 2 lots is less than 0.693 and greater than –0.693 using the equivalence testing procedure 
for 3 vaccine groups given by Wiens and Iglewicz. Similar descriptive procedures were used for other 
time points. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 1712 subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to receive 13vPnC pilot scale lot 1, 
13vPnC pilot scale lot 2, 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot, or 7vPnC, together with concomitant Pediarix 
and  Hib  vaccine  at  2,  4,  and  6  months  of  age  for  the  infant  series.  However,  of  the  1712  randomly 
assigned subjects, 3 subjects (2 randomly assigned subjects to 13vPnC pilot scale lot 2 and 1 subject 
assigned to 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot) had not given consent to be in  the study, and thus were 
withdrawn  from  the  study  prior  to  receiving  study  vaccine.  A  total  of  1508  subjects  were  previously 
reported as completing the infant series (see section 8.1 in infant CSR-74251), however, the data for 1 
subject randomly assigned to 13vPnC manufacturing scale lot changed after the analysis of the infant 
series. Therefore, 1507 subjects (88.0%) completed the infant series. 
A  total  of  76  subjects  (4.4%)  were  withdrawn  after  the  infant  series  (after  the  blood  draw  following 
dose 3 of the infant series up to administration of the toddler dose); a similar percentage of subjects 
were  withdrawn  after the infant  series  from  each  13vPnC  group  (4.1%  in the pilot  scale lot  1  group, 
5.9%  in  the  pilot  scale  lot  2  group,  and  3.7%  in  the  manufacturing  scale  lot  group)  and  the  7vPnC 
group (3.7%). An additional 3 subjects (0.1%) with an unknown completion status also withdrew after 
the  infant  series,  but  the  study  conclusion  form  was  completed  at  a  subsequent  visit.  The  remaining 
1428  subjects  (1220  in  the  13vPnC  groups  and  208  in  the  7vPnC  group)  were  vaccinated  with  the 
toddler dose and made up the safety population. A total of 25 subjects (1.5%) were withdrawn during 
the toddler dose period before the blood sample was obtained (17 in the 13vPnC groups and 8 subjects 
in the 7vPnC group). Thus, 1403 subjects (82.0%) completed the toddler dose portion of the study. A 
telephone contact was to be attempted for all subjects 6 months after their last vaccination (including 
Prevenar 13 P46 035

subjects who did not complete the study because of early discontinuation). Of the 1464 subjects who 
agreed to be contacted, 1430 subjects 85.3%, 83.2%, and 83.0% in the 13vPnC groups, and 81.7% in 
the  7vPnC  group)  completed  the  6-month  follow-up  telephone  contact.  A  total  of  1376  subjects 
(80.4%) completed the study; a similar percentage of subjects completed the study from each 13vPnC 
group  (82.4%,  78.7%,  and  80.4%  in  the  13vPnC  groups)  and  the  7vPnC  group  (79.7%).  Twenty-
seven (27) subjects were withdrawn after the toddler dose. One (1) subject (13vPnC pilot scale lot 1) 
was withdrawn because of an SAE; the remaining 26 subjects were lost to follow-up. 
 
Efficacy results 
This  assessment  report  presents  the  planned  assessments  of  pneumococcal  immune  responses  in 
13vPnC lots measured 1 month after the toddler dose (visit 6), a secondary objective of the study. In 
addition,  this  report  presents  the  additional  assessments  of  pneumococcal  immune  responses 
measured  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  in  the  7vPnC  group,  and  varicella  and  mumps  immune 
responses measured 1 month after the toddler dose. 
Immune Response to Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines 
The  three  13vPnC  lots  were  determined  to  be  equivalent  across  all  serotypes as  confidence  intervals 
for  the  differences  between  each  2-way  comparison  of  vaccine  lots,  expressed  as  the  natural  log-
transformed  geometric  mean  concentration  (GMC)  values,  was  less  than  the  absolute  value  of  0.693 
(2-fold criterion). The differences between vaccine lots in log-transformed geometric means were small 
for all serotypes (table 9-2). Across the common serotypes, the largest differences were 0.18 for lot 1 
to lot 2 (serotype 6B), -0.37 for lot 1 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 19F), and -0.33 for lot 2 
to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 19F). Across the additional serotypes, the largest differences 
were 0.17 for lot 1 to lot 2 (serotype 5), 0.10 for lot 1 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotypes 5 and 
6A), and -0.13 for lot 2 to the manufacturing scale lot (serotype 3). Similar results were seen for the 
all-available population.

The percentage of responders in the evaluable pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population with 
antibody concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 7 common serotypes was at least 98.3% for the 3 lots. 
For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  percentage  of  responders  was  at  least  99.1%  for  all  serotypes 
except serotype 3, where the percentage of responders was 83.6% for the pilot lot 1 group, 80.8% for 
the pilot lot 2 group, and 88.5% for the manufacturing lot group. Similar results were seen in the all-
available toddler immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes.  
The percentage of responders in the evaluable pneumococcal toddler immunogenicity population  with 
antibody  concentrations  ≥1.00  μg/mL  for  the  7  common  serotypes  of  the  three  13vPnC  lots  was  at 
least  79.6%  (Table  9-4).  For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  percentage  of  responders  was  at  least 
91.0%  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype  3,  where  the  percentage  of  responders  with  antibody 
concentrations ≥1.00 μg/mL was 32.0%, 30.3%, and 36.8% for the 3 lots of 13vPnC. Similar results 
were seen in the all-available toddler immunogenicity population for all 13 serotypes.

A non-inferiority comparison of the anti-polysaccharide IgG responses after the infant series and after 
the toddler dose  was performed during the procedure and submitted in response  to questions. These 
analyses  showed  that  the  responses  to  the  7  common  serotypes  in  13vPnC  were  non-inferior  to  the 
7vPnC  responses.  Additional  analyses  comparing  the  responses  to  the  6  additional  serotypes  to  the 
lowest responder to the 7 common serotypes in 7vPnC recipients are presented in the CSR. These data 
showed  that  responses  to  the  6  additional  serotypes  were  non-inferior  for  all  serotypes,  except  for 
serotype 3. At the additional comparison level of ≥0.15 μg/mL, non-inferiority criterion was met for all 
13 serotypes, including serotype 3. And, when compared to the actual responses in 7vPnC recipients, 
the responses to the 6 additional serotypes, including serotype 3, were superior in 13vPnC recipients. 
These data are similar to what was seen in the US pivotal trial, study 004. The inability of the serotype 
3 response to meet the non-inferiority criteria in these 2 studies performed in a US infant population is 
very different from  the responses  to serotype 3  in all other phase  3 clinical trials which were higher. 
These  studies  were  performed  in  various  European  countries  using  several  infant  vaccination 
schedules.  The  differences  in  responses  cannot  be  attributed  to  differences  in  vaccine  or  monovalent 
conjugated  serotype  3  bulk  substance,  because  common  vaccine  and  drug  substance  lots  were  used 
across studies. The reason for the relatively lower responses seen in the US trials is unknown.

Responses to concomitant vaccine antigens 
Varivax was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC or 7vPnC at the 12-month visit. Responses 
to  the  varicella  antigen  in  Varivax  were  evaluated  at  2  prespecified  antibody  levels  associated  with 
seroconversion  (≥1.25  gpELISA  units/mL)  and  long-term  protection  (≥5.00  gpELISA  units/mL).  The 
proportion of responders in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups were similar. All (100%) Varivax recipients 
in both the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups achieved antibody levels ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL; 98.8% and 
97.7%  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups,  respectively,  achieved  antibody  levels  ≥5.00  gpELISA 
units/mL.  
Geometric  mean  values  were  15.38  gpELISA  units/mL  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  and  16.04 
gpELISA units/mL in the 7vPnC  group. The geometric mean ratio (13vPnC/ 7vPnC) was 0.96 and the 
ratio at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.85. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  concomitant  vaccine  toddler  immunogenicity  population 
achieving  a  mumps  serum  antibody  titer  ≥10.0  antibody  (Ab)  units/mL  was  95.7%  in  the  13vPnC 
combined  group  and  97.6%  in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  difference  (13vPnC  combined  –  7vPnC)  in  the 
proportion of responders between vaccine groups was -1.9, and the difference at the lower limit of the 
95% CI was -6.5. 
The geometric mean levels of mumps antibodies after the toddler dose were 58.55 Ab units/mL for the 
13vPnC  combined  group  and  66.91  Ab  units/mL  for  the  7vPnC  group  in  the  evaluable  concomitant 
vaccine toddler immunogenicity population. The ratio (13vPnC/  7vPnC) was 0.88 and the ratio at the 
lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.71. 
  Safety results 
Safety results after the toddler dose 
The endpoints for the safety analysis were the incidence of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs. 
Parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  were  required  to  monitor  the  occurrence  of  local  reactions  and  systemic 
events that occurred within 7 days after the toddler dose and enter these into an e-diary. 
Local  reactions  included  tenderness,  induration,  and  erythema  at  the  site  of  the  pneumococcal 
conjugate injection. The systemic events specified in the protocol were fever (core [rectal] temperature 
of  equal  to  or  greater  than  100.4°F  [38.0°C])  and  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  treat  and  to 
prevent  symptoms,  as  well  as  decreased  appetite,  irritability,  hives  (urticaria),  increased  sleep,  and 
decreased sleep. The severity of local reactions was also assessed and reported in the e-diary. 
Adverse  events  were  to  be  collected  from  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  until  the  infant  series 
blood draw at 1 month after dose 3 and between visit 5 and visit 6. All SAEs were to be recorded from 
the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  to  6  months  after  the  last  study  vaccination  when  a  telephone 
contact  was  to  be  made  to  record  any  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions,  hospitalizations, 
SAEs,  and  other  reportable  information  that  occurred  since  the  last  study  visit.  Presented  in  this 
section are the safety results from the toddler dose and the 6-month follow-up telephone contact. 
Safety data from the infant series visits were presented and assessed previously. 
Reactogenicity 
A summary of local reaction reported wihthi 7 days of the toddler dose is presented in Table 10-1. The 
frequency of subjects with at least 1 local reaction was similar in the 13vPnC combined group (69.0%) 
and the 7vPnC group (75.2%; Table 10-1). Most local reactions were mild in severity.

The number and percentage of subjects with systemic events within 7 days after the toddler dose are 
summarized  in  Table  10-3.  Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  having  1  or  more  systemic  events, 
excluding the use of antipyretic medications, was 90.5% in the 13vPnC combined group and 88.9% in 
the 7vPnC group. There were no significant differences between the vaccine groups in the incidence of 
individual systemic events or for any systemic event.

Other adverse events 
During the toddler dose, ie, the period from the toddler dose to the blood draw after the toddler dose, 
438  subjects  (36.2%)  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  had  728  AEs  and  76  subjects  (36.5%)  in  the 
7vPnC group had 138 AEs. The AEs categorized under infections and infestations were reported most 
frequently  in  both  vaccine  groups,  with  otitis  media  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  being  the 
most  common  infections.  Otitis  media  was  reported  in  70  recipients  (5.8%)  of  13vPnC  and  20 
recipients (9.6%) of 7vPnC, and upper respiratory tract infection was reported in 62 recipients (5.1%) 
of 13vPnC and 11 recipients (5.3%) of 7vPnC. No  statistically significant differences  between vaccine 
groups  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  were  observed  for  any  system  organ  class;  however,  a  significantly 
(p=0.045)  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group  had  otitis  media  than  in  the  13vPnC 
combined group  and  a  significantly  (p=0.044)  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC  group  had 
constipation than in the 13vPnC combined group. 
During  the  toddler  dose  7  subjects  (0.6%)  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  had  8  severe  or  life-
threatening AEs and 2 subjects (1.0%) in the 7vPnC group had 3 events. A single life-threatening AE, 
near  drowning,  was  reported  in  a  13vPnC  recipient.  No  event  considered  severe  occurred  in  multiple 
subjects. No statistically significant differences between vaccine groups were noted for individual AEs, 
however,  in  the  system  organ  class  of  gastrointestinal  disorders,  a  significantly  (p=0.021)  higher 
percentage  of  7vPnC  recipients  than  13vPnC  recipients  reported  severe  AEs.  This  included  severe 
diarrhea in 1 subject and severe constipation in 1 subject; both subjects were recipients of 7vPnC. 
During the toddler dose 21 recipients (1.7%) of 13vPnC had 24 related AEs and 1 recipient (0.5%) of 
7vPnC had a related AE. The most frequent related AEs were in the category of general disorders and 
administration site conditions. The  majority of these events occurred at concomitant vaccine injection 
sites, and the others described reactions that were not captured in the e-diary  (bruising  or “knot” at 
injection  site).  The  most  frequent  related  AEs  were  pyrexia  and  rash.  Pyrexia  assessed  as  related 
occurred  in  3  recipients  (0.2%)  of  13vPnC  and  1  recipient  (0.5%)  of  7vPnC.  All  4  cases  of  rash 
assessed  as  related  were  reported  in  4  recipients  (0.3%)  of  13vPnC.  No  statistically  significant 
differences between vaccine groups were noted for any related AE. 
During the toddler dose, 9 recipients (0.7%) of 13vPnC had a total of 11 SAEs and 1 recipient (0.5%) 
of  7vPnC  had  3  SAEs.  The  most  common  SAEs  were  in  the  category  of  infections  and  infestations, 
which  were  in  0.3%  of  subjects  in  the  13vPnC  combined  group  and  0.5%  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC 
group.  No  statistically  significant  differences  between  vaccine  groups  were  noted  in  the  incidence  of 
SAEs. 
One (1) SAE was assessed as related to study vaccine. Subject 3005-040-003830 received the 13vPnC 
manufacturing  lot  at  the  toddler  dose  and  concomitant  MMR,  varicella,  and  HAV.  Four  (4)  days  later 
the  subject  had  bronchial  hyperreactivity,  which  was  considered  to  be  of  moderate  severity. 
Approximately  8  months preceding  this  event,  2  days  after  receiving  dose  2 of  the  infant  series,  the 
subject  also  had  an  SAE  of  bronchiolitis,  which  was  considered  to  be  of  moderate  severity  and  not 
related to the study vaccine.  
No subjects were withdrawn because of AEs during the toddler dose. 
No deaths were reported after the toddler dose. 
6 months follow-up after the infant dose 
Summaries  of  the  AEs  to  be  reported  after  the  infant  series,  up  until  the  toddler  dose  are  provided 
below. After the infant series, 111 subjects (7.7%) in the 13vPnC combined group had 140 AEs and 14 
subjects  (5.7%)  in  the  7vPnC  group  had  15  AEs.  In  addition,  an  AE  was  reported  for  1  subject  who 
received a vaccination other than the randomly assigned vaccine during the infant series.  
The  AEs  reported  most  frequently  after  the  infant  series  were  categorized  as  infections  and 
infestations,  including  38  events  in  32  recipients  of  13vPnC  (2.2%)  and  2  events  in  2  recipients  of 
7vPnC  (0.8%);  and  as  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders,  including  29  events  in  25 
recipients of 13vPnC (1.7%) and 6 events in 5 recipients of 7vPnC (2.0%). The incidence of individual 
AEs  did  not  exceed  1.0%  of  recipients  of  either  study  vaccine;  rhinitis  allergic,  bronchial 
hyperreactivity, and eczema had  the highest incidences  and were reported by no more than  0.8% of 
Prevenar 13 P46 035 
Page 14/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recipients  of  either  study  vaccine.  Any  differences  between  the  13vPnC  combined  and  7vPnC  groups 
were not statistically significant. 
After  the  infant  series,  25  severe  or  life  threatening  AEs  were  reported  in  17  subjects  (1.2%)  in  the 
13vPnC combined group and 2 events in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the 7vPnC group. None of the severe or 
life threatening AEs after the infant series were related to study vaccination. 
One  (1)  of  the  AEs  was  life  threatening.  Subject  3005-038-003637  was  hospitalized  for  respiratory 
arrest. This AE resolved on the day of onset. 
No significant differences were observed between the 13vPnC combined group and the 7vPnC 
group. 
Thirty-seven (37) SAEs were reported in 25 recipients of 13vPnC (1.7%) and 3 SAEs were reported in 
3  recipients  of  7vPnC  (1.2%)  after  the  infant  series.  In  addition,  1  SAE  (respiratory  syncytial  virus 
bronchiolitis) was reported in a subject who received a vaccination other than the randomly assigned 
vaccine. None of the SAEs were considered related to the vaccine. The most common SAEs were those 
categorized  as  infections  and  infestations.  Serious  infections  occurred  in  17  recipients  of  13vPnC 
(1.2%),  which  includes  the  1  subject  who  received  a  vaccination  other  than  the  randomly  assigned 
vaccine. Cellulitis was the most common event in this category and occurred in 3 recipients of 13vPnC 
(0.2%);  no  recipients  of  7vPnC  reported  cellulitis.  Among  the  recipients  of  7vPnC,  1  subject  (0.4%) 
had  a  serious  infection  of  pneumonia.  No  statistically  significant  differences  between  vaccine  groups 
were noted in the incidence of SAEs. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH overall conclusions: 
Additional  pneumococcal  immunogenicity  data  from  study  3005  show  that  the  responses  elicited  by 
13vPnC in its final formulation are comparable and non-inferior to those elicited by 7vPnC following a 
2, 4, 6-month infant series and following the toddler dose.  The results from  study 3005 also indicate 
that  coadministration  of  13vPnC  does  not  interfere  with  responses  to  mumps  or  varicella  antigens  in 
comparison with results following coadminstration of 7vPnC. 
The  toddler  dose  safety  data  from  study  3005  demonstrated  similar  rates  of  local  reactions  and 
systemic  events  among  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  recipients.  There  were  no  differences  in  the  rates  and 
nature  of  SAEs  and  other  AEs  associated  with  13vPnC  compared  with  7vPnC  in  the  additional  safety 
data from studies 006, 500, 501, and 3005. The safety profile of 13vPnC was shown to be comparable 
with 7vPnC and the  frequency of adverse  drug  reactions (ADRs) has  not changed compared with the 
frequency reported in the MAA. 
The data presented in this Article 46 submission package does not alter the benefit-risk assessment of 
13vPnC. 
III. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Immunogenicity: The results of study 3005 confirm what was reported during the MAA procedure. The 
responses to serotype 3 were considerably lower than to the other serotypes, which was also seen in 
the  previously  reported  clinical  trials.  Many  of  the  data  presented  in  the  clinical  study  report  were 
already discussed during the procedure, and will not be addressed again here.   
Safety: The results presented confirm the previous safety profile of Prevenar 13. No new safety signals 
were detected.

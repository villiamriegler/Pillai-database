1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

psoriatic arthritis in adults patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to 
one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) for Bimzelx, based on results of a Phase 
III study in biological DMARD naïve study 
participants (PA0010; BE OPTIMAL) and a Phase III 
study in study participants who are inadequate 
responders (inadequate response or intolerant) to ≤2 
prior TNF inhibitors (PA0011; BE COMPLETE). Both 
Phase III studies are interventional studies aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab. For 
PA0010, the Initial Treatment Period was placebo- 
and no inferential active reference (adalimumab)-
controlled, while PA0011 was placebo-controlled. As 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 to the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP 
version 1.7 is acceptable. Furthermore, the PI is 
brought in line with the latest QRD template version 
10.2 rev.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

interventional and controlled phase III clinical

MOBILE 2), which provide evidence of the efficacy 
and safety of bimekizumab in axSpA (nr-axSpA and 
AS), both compared to placebo treatment. As a

The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab was evaluated in a 
efficacy information based on interim results from 
study PS0015; this is a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, active comparator controlled, parallel 
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
bimekizumab compared with secukinumab in adult 
study participants with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.2.

double-blind study compared with secukinumab, an IL-17A 
inhibitor. Bimekizumab-treated patients achieved 
significantly higher response rates compared to 
secukinumab. The results are consistent with the previous 
pivotal study results previously assessed and reported in 
the SmPC. For more information, please refer to the

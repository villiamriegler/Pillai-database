are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (MEA-060.5). 
This is an observational study to assess the 
effectiveness of the Neulasta patient alert card and 
to measure medication errors related to the use of 
the On-Body Injector. Data provided justified 
additional activity to be included in the Patient 
Instruction for use in the package leaflet. The MAH 
took the occasion to amend local representative 
details for Malta, Germany and to align the PI to the 
recent QRD template version 10.2. The RMP version

SmPC, Annex 
In the post-marketing observational study setting, 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 
II and PL 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid 
retrospective cohort study with primary outcome the 
time from index date to diagnosis of MDS or AML 
(safety). As a result, section 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC is updated to add a new warning on 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML), and to add them in the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 
uncommon; the Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.1.

The MAH implemented a pregnancy surveillance 
Amgen’s pregnancy surveillance program (PSP) and

programme (PSP) and lactation surveillance programme 
lactation surveillance program (LSP) and section 4.9 
and PL 
(LSP) to facilitate the reporting of all available information 
on the use of Amgen products during pregnancy and 
lactation. This information has been included in the SmPC 
and PL to help increase awareness of the programmes 
among healthcare professionals. The MAH also updated the 
PI according to the latest QRD version 9.0. 
on information on overdose. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. Amgen also addressed in this 
submission the Quality Review of Documents (QRD) 
groups comments on the SmPC, PL (including the 
instructions for use) and labelling made during the 
recently concluded procedure to introduce minor 
changes to the Automatic Needle Guard for the 6mg 
pre-filled syringes (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/000420/IB/0067). 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the

granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim) including patients undergoing chemotherapy 
and a healthy donor undergoing peripheral blood progenitor 
cell mobilisation. It has been reported rarely in cancer 
patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration 
of Neulasta. Capillary leak syndrome is characterised by 
hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and 
hemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of 
capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and 
receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may 
include a need for intensive care. This information is 
reflected in the revised product information.

The safety and efficacy data from study 990130 in 
update of the SPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 to 
add information for physicians on recommended use 
in paediatric patients based on a clinical study 
990130 and a publication. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
paediatric patients lead to the amendment of section 4.2 
and introduction of new information in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SPC.  
Section 4.2 
Paediatric patients 
The experience in children is limited. See sections 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2. 
Section 4.8  
A higher frequency of serious adverse events in younger 
children aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed 
compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 years 
respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common 
adverse study medicinal product reaction was bone pain 
(see section 5.1 and 5.2). 
Section 5.1  
In a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label 
study of paediatric sarcoma patients receiving 100 ?g/kg 
pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide (VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a 
longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 
Page 24/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
109) was observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (8.9 
days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and 12-
21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. 
Additionally a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was 
observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (75%) 
compared to older children aged 6 11 years and 12-21 
years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Section 5.2 Paediatric patients 
The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 
paediatric patients with sarcoma, who received 100 ?g/kg 
pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE 
chemotherapy.  The youngest age group (0-5 years) had a 
higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (± Standard 
Deviation) (47.9 ± 22.5 ?g·hr/ml) than older children aged 
6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 ± 13.1 ?g·hr/ml and 
29.3 ± 23.2 ?g·hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With 
the exception of the youngest age group (0 5 years), the 
mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that 
for adult patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer 
and receiving 100 ?g/kg pegfilgrasti

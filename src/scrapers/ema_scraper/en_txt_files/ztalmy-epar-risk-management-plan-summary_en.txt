ZTALMYÂ® 
Centralised 
Chemical class: 
Neurosteroid; a methyl substituted analogue of the endogenous 
neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a derivative of progesterone. 
Summary of mode of action: 
Ganaxolone (GNX) has the same core structure as allopregnanolone, 
but with the addition of a 3Î²-methyl group to prevent enzymatic 
conversion to an entity (i.e., 3-keto) active at nuclear progesterone 
receptors. GNX is a neuroactive steroid that positively and 
allosterically modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) 
receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) by interacting with a 
recognition site that is distinct from other allosteric GABAA receptor 
modulators.  
The precise mechanism by which GNX exerts its therapeutic effects 
in the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-
like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is unknown, but its 
anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from this modulation of 
GABAA receptor function providing constant, or tonic, modulation 
of GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. 
Important information about its composition: 
The chemical name for GNX is 3Î±-hydroxy-3Î²-methyl-5Î±-pregnan-
20-one (C22H36O2) with a molecular weight of 332.53 kD. It is a 
neutral hydrocarbon molecule. The oral suspension of GNX has a 
shelf life of 2 years.

Indication 
ZTALMY is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with cyclin-
dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 to 17 years of age. 
ZTALMY may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. 
Incidence and prevalence  
CDD is classed as a rare disease with an estimated global prevalence of 1:42,000 (CDKL5 UK 
2021, LouLou Foundation, 2021). The exact prevalence of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 
(CDKL5) mutations in the European Union (EU) is currently unknown. Mutations in CDKL5 are 
estimated at approximately 1 in 40,000â60,000 live births (Jakimiec 2020; Olsen 2019, Demarest 
2019). 
An estimate for birth prevalence of CDD in Australia was published in 2017 based on an analysis 
of data from the International CDKL5 Disorder Database (ICDD) (Hector 2017). These authors 
suggest a lower estimate of birth prevalence in Australia of 0.21 cases per 100,000 live births 
(95% CI 0.12â0.33) for the years 1982 to 2014. However, these authors cautioned that, whilst a 
birth prevalence in this range would indicate that CDKL5 deficiency is an ultra-rare disorder, it 
was likely that this figure would increase as targeted next-generation sequencing for investigation 
of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy becomes more common and more families contribute to 
the database. Indeed, the frequency of patients diagnosed with CDD is already increasing due to 
growing awareness of the disorder and the inclusion of CDKL5 in routine genetic testing of early 
epileptic encephalopathies (Gokben 2017). In 2016, the LouLou Foundation was aware of over 
1,200 documented cases worldwide (LouLou Foundation, 2021). 
A study conducted in the United Kingdom recruited 343 children presenting with epilepsy under 
the age of 3 years between May 2014 and May 2017 from all 20 regional paediatric departments 
and four tertiary childrenâs hospitals in Scotland. Four unrelated cases of CDKL5 epilepsy were 
identified from the 333 patients who completed genetic testing (4/333; 1.2%), giving an annual 
incidence of 1 per 42,400 live births (2.36/100,000 [95% CI, 0.805-5.59]; Symonds 2019). A 
population-based approach was taken to avoid selection bias with broad inclusion criteria and 
proactive recruitment strategy, although a small cohort was assessed and only considered patients 
aged <3 years. An earlier study was conducted in the US on 8565 individuals with epilepsy 
and/or neurodevelopment disorders over a 4-year period from December 2011 to December 2015. 
Genetic diagnosis was positive in 1315 cases, from which 99 cases of CDKL5 epilepsy were 
identified (99/1315; 7.6%), with patient age at molecular diagnosis ranging from 0.1 â 31.1 years 
(mean age 3.3 years, median age 1.8 years) (Lindy 2018). 
A distribution of cases by country of residence, based on data in the ICDD, is publicly available 
(Figure 1). Based on this breakdown, roughly 25% of cases in the ICDD are in EU27+3 
countries, although the extent of reporting to this database from EU countries is not known. 
Prevalence estimates based on this type of data are likely to suffer from ascertainment bias, as 
well as bias due to variable availability of routine next-generation genetic testing for early onset 
epileptic encephalopathy (Mangatt 2016). Furthermore, CDKL5 has only recently been included 
 
in the panel of genes screened for mutations. Many historical cases are likely to remain 
misclassified, and/or are included in the RettBASE database (RettSyndrome.org Variation 
Database: http://mecp2.chw.edu.au/) instead of, or in addition to ICDD. As of June 5, 2016, there 
were 498 cases of CDD recorded in RettBASE (Krishnaraj 2017).

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication â age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
CDD is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with onset early in life (median age of 6 
weeks) with 90% beginning by 3 months (Olsen 2019), caused by a mutation in the catalytic 
domain of the CDKL5 gene (Fehr 2013). The CDKL5 gene is located on the X chromosome; the 
majority of CDD patients are heterozygous females carrying missense, nonsense, splice, or 
frameshift CDKL5 gene mutations, or a genomic deletion (Bahi-Buisson 2011; Fuchs 2018). 
Boys carrying mutations in CDKL5 are much rarer (Mangatt 2016; Amendola 2014; Fehr 2013) 
and show more severe epileptic encephalopathy than girls (Fehr 2016; Fehr 2015; Mirzaa 2013), 
probably due to the more severe consequences of dominant X-linked mutations in males than in 
females. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in many ethnic groups, with more females than 
males being reported with an approximate ratio of 4:1 (NORD 2020). 
 
Other risk factors include a family history of CDKL5 mutations. This is probably the effect of 
germline mosaicism in one of the parents, such that the offspring can inherit the mutated gene; 
the frequency of mosaicism variants being estimated at about 8.8% of CDDs (Jakimiec 2020). 
The main existing treatment options 
There is currently no targeted therapy available to solve the underlying problem related to CDD 
(Wilcox 2020). Treatments are symptomatic and directed at the most disabling consequences of 
the disorder. Additional care may be provided through physiotherapy, occupational therapy, 
neurological speech therapy, and dietetics (Bahi-Buisson 2011, Jakimiec 2020). 
Eighty percent of children with CDD have daily seizures and 20% have weekly to monthly 
seizures (Olsen 2019). Current treatment methods for CDD-related seizures include anti-epileptic 
drugs (AEDs), ketogenic diet, vagal nerve stimulation, neurosurgery, and steroid treatment 
(International Foundation for CDKL5 Research 2014). In the case of AEDs, none is specifically 
indicated for the treatment of CDD, and all are incompletely effective as chronic treatments, with 
a few of the more effective AEDs leading to seizure control lasting only a few weeks to a few 
months. An international survey of current practice in CDD was conducted amongst 47 experts, 
including 30 paediatric neurologists, 10 epileptologists, and 2 geneticists, as well as a general 
paediatrician, a development/community paediatrician, and an allied health professional. Two of 
the 47 respondents did not describe their specialty. The aim of the survey was to provide 
consensus guidance for the delivery of best clinical care. There was no consensus for any of the 
first, second, third, or fourth line suggested therapies for epileptic spasms associated with CDD 
although consensus recommendation was identified for GNX and cannabidiol (CBD) to be 
offered if clinically indicated (Amin 2022). 
Although existing licensed AEDs (ILAE 2021; Glauser 2013) are used to treat CDD, they have 
limited efficacy in this condition. In one cohort of 86 patients derived from the International Rett 
Syndrome patient registry and database (InterRett), overall control of seizures was poor, with 
52/72 (72%) females and 8/9 (89%) males having daily seizures, 5/72 (7%) females having 
weekly seizures, and 10/72 (14%) females and 1/9 (11%) males having monthly seizures. Only 
5/72 (7%) females had experienced no seizures in the last year (Fehr 2013). A larger cohort with 
seizure information (n=137) from the ICDD (which may partially overlap the InterRett database) 
also suggests a poor therapeutic outcome with current therapies. Ninety-five patients (69.3%) 
were experiencing seizures daily, on average between 1 and 21 seizures/day, 19 (13.9%) 
experienced weekly seizures, 13 (9.5%) experienced monthly seizures, and 1 (0.7%) experienced 
occasional seizures. Only 9 (6.6%) individuals were seizure free for >1 year (Mangatt 2016). 
These publications suggest poor seizure control; however, neither explicitly characterises the 
range of therapeutic interventions these cohorts of CDD patients were or had been receiving. 
A retrospective review of 39 CDD patients (34 females; age 0.6-22.4 years; mean 7.3 years; 
median 5.8 years) who had gone through a multitude of AED treatments, including the ketogenic 
diet, illustrates the generally poor treatment response (MÃ¼ller 2016). Patients were treated with 3 
to 21 (mean 9; median 9) AEDs, most commonly valproic acid (87%), levetiracetam (79%), 
topiramate (79%), steroids (67%), phenobarbital (67%) and vigabatrin (64%); 31% undertook a 
ketogenic diet. A responder rate (defined as 50% seizure reduction) to at least one AED of 69% 
was observed at 3 months, 45% at 6 months, falling to 24% at 12 months. Medications with the 
highest rates of seizure reduction at 3 months included felbamate, vigabatrin, clobazam, valproic 
acid, steroids, lamotrigine and zonisamide. At 12 months, the responder rate dropped to 0â20% 
except for 1/3 (33%) still responding to felbamate. Only 2 patients became seizure free: one with 
carbamazepine for 10 years, and another with vigabatrin plus phenobarbital for 3 years. In all 
other patients, seizures reoccurred within weeks to months of initiating a new AED. Most patients 
showed transient responses of varying degrees to AEDs with different modes of action, which 
was typically lost 3 months following the AED regimen change. Currently, there is no disease-
specific AED regime available with long-term efficacy in patients with CDD (MÃ¼ller 2016).  
Despite the availability of many new AEDs with differing mechanisms of action, overall 
outcomes in newly diagnosed epilepsy have not improved. A longitudinal observational cohort 
study was conducted at the Epilepsy Unit of the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, Scotland on 1795 
individuals who were newly treated for epilepsy with AEDs between July 1982 and October 
2012. Individuals were followed up for a minimum of 2 years (until October 2014) or until death, 
whichever came sooner. During the first decade of the study, the most prescribed drugs were 
carbamazepine, valproate and phenytoin. By the final decade, the predominant AEDs were 
valproate, levetiracetam and lamotrigine. Most patients who attain control do so with the first or 
second AED. The probability of achieving seizure freedom diminishes substantially with each 
subsequent AED regimen tried. More than one-third of patients experience epilepsy that remains 
uncontrolled (Chen 2018). 
Cannabidiol (CBD; EPIDYOLEXÂ® SmPC) is authorised in Europe for the adjunctive treatment 
of seizures in patients from 2 years of age with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome or 
tuberous sclerosis complex. Studies have also been conducted on the effectiveness of cannabidiol 
therapy in patients with mutations in the CDKL5 gene and other genetic epileptic 
encephalopathies. In an open-label interventional trial of 17 CDD patients, the median convulsive 
frequency decreased from baseline by 41% after 12 weeks of therapy (n=11, interquartile range 
[IQR]:3-65%) and by almost 60% after 48 weeks of treatment (n=10, IQR:5-75%). The decrease 
in seizure frequency at baseline (66.4 [n=17], IQR: 25.9â212.0) to that at Week 12 (35.8 [n=11], 
IQR: 8.9â141.6) was statistically significant (p=0.032). The percentage of responders (â¥50%) 
was 41% at Week 12 and 53% by Week 48 (Devinsky 2018).  
Other treatment approaches in CDD that can be used as adjuncts to AEDs include the ketogenic 
diet, vagal nerve stimulation, steroids including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and 
neurosurgery (International Foundation for CDKL5 Research 2014). The ketogenic diet has 
modest efficacy in treating epilepsy in CDD (Olsen 2019). A cohort of 104 individuals with CDD 
treated with a ketogenic diet were studied; median duration of ketogenic diet use was 17 months 
and positive seizure effects were observed in 58.7% (61/104) (Lim 2017). Of the 61 individuals 
with positive effects, 49 (80%) reported improvement in seizure frequency, 31 (51%) in seizure 
duration, and 37 (61%) in seizure intensity. However, compared to those who had never been on 
the ketogenic diet, the seizure rates were slightly higher in those currently on the diet (incidence 
rate ratio [IRR] = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.75â1.93) after adjusting for gender, variant group, presence 
of seizure-free period, and duration of epilepsy. At ascertainment, only 33 individuals (32%) 
remained on the diet; the most common reason cited for discontinuing the ketogenic diet (in 70 
individuals) was the lack of long-term efficacy (51%), followed by severe side effects (26%) 
(Lim 2017). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
The primary symptoms of CDD include early-onset epilepsy (mostly drug-refractory), 
generalised hypotonia, neurodevelopmental disability, and cortical vision disorders. Several 
accompanying symptoms are observed, such as autistic features (poor social interactions, poor 
eye contact), hand stereotypies, gastrointestinal (GI) and orthopaedic abnormalities, or 
dysmorphic facial features. Despite extensive studies the correlation between the type or location 
of the mutation and the severity of symptoms cannot be clearly determined (Jakimiec 2020).  
Epileptic seizures are usually the first symptom of CDD; the first seizure episodes occurring in 
96.9% of patients in the first six months of life and in 90% in the first three months of life 
(Jakimiec 2020; Mangatt 2016). A 3-stage progression has been reported consisting of early 
epilepsy (stage 1), followed by infantile spasms (stage 2) and, finally, multifocal and refractory 
myoclonic epilepsy (stage 3) (Bahi-Buisson 2011). Early diagnosis may have a considerable 
impact on the quality of life of patients and their families, as well as on psychomotor and 
intellectual development. Retardation of psychomotor development and intellectual disability 
affects all patients with CDD (Jakimiec 2020), with an IQ <40 in all 19 CDD patients with a 
documented IQ score as identified in the Rett Networked Database (Frullanti 2019). The 
impairment seems to be more related to speech and fine motor skills than achievements in gross 
motor skills. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates nonspecific abnormalities of 
varying severity, often showing cortical atrophy and hyperintensities in the white matter of the 
temporal lobe (Bahi-Buisson 2011). Neuroimaging therefore has limited use for diagnosis, 
differentiation, or prognosis in CDD. 
Due to the rarity of CDD, very little is known about long-term prognosis and life expectancy. 
Most individuals who have been identified are under 18 years of age; it is often difficult to 
identify older children and adults due to the frequent lack of complete infant and childhood 
developmental records and less frequent genetic testing in older individuals.  
Important co-morbidities 
The establishment of the ICDD has provided opportunity to examine the prevalence of 
comorbidities of CDD, such as epilepsy, GI problems including feeding difficulties, sleep and 
respiratory problems and scoliosis. In 167 individuals with the disorder, at least one episode of GI 
dysfunction was experienced by 86.5% patients, with 71% of patients affected by constipation, 
64% with gastroesophageal reflux disease, and 27% experiencing aerophagia (Mangatt 2016). 
Gastrointestinal disorders are 3.5 times (p=0.02) more prevalent in patients over 10 years of age 
compared to children under 5 years. Feeding difficulties were reported for 51% of the orally fed 
individuals with 60% of the children over 2 years of age completely dependent on their families 
and carers for eating and drinking. A fifth of affected individuals were exclusively enterally fed 
(gastrostomy tube or nasogastric tube feeding). The majority (86.5%) of individuals were 
reported to have experienced a sleep problem during their lifetime with current night waking 
occurring in 58.5%. Almost one-third (32.5 %) were reported to have breathing irregularities at 
the time of registration, including hyperventilation (13.6%) and breath holding (26.4%). A history 
of pneumonia was reported for 21.4% and aspiration for 22.6%. The risk of developing scoliosis 
increased with age with a 68.5% (95% CI 0.53, 0.80) likelihood of developing scoliosis by age 10 
years. In comparison to other comorbidities, scoliosis was the least frequently observed and has 
been rarely reported previously in the literature, possibly due to the younger age distributions in 
earlier studies since this is a comorbidity that develops over time (Mangatt 2016).  
An earlier study of 86 individuals with a CDKL5 mutation identified through the InterRett 
database (Fehr 2013) observed that CDD patients present with a subtle dysmorphism. Frequently 
observed facial phenotypic features included a prominent and/or broad forehead (74%), deep-set 
but âlargeâ-appearing eyes (73%), full lips/everted lower (67%), and well-defined philtrum 
(61%). Fingers in young children are often tapered with proximally puffy fingers/prominent 
proximal interphalangeal joint observed in 42% and hallux vagus observed in 25% (Fehr 2013). 
Overall, the likelihood of experiencing epilepsy, GI problems, respiratory problems, and scoliosis 
increased with age and males were more vulnerable to respiratory and sleep problems than 
females. There was no clear relationship observed between mutation group and prevalence of 
comorbidities (Mangatt 2016). 
With any epileptic syndrome that affects multiple systems in the body, as CDD does, there is a 
higher possibility of premature death due to the epilepsy syndrome per se, or other contributing 
factors like respiratory and GI problems/failure. Unexpected death, most likely due to sudden 
unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is also a risk for patients with CDD (Jakimiec 2020). 
 
Part II:  Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
A comprehensive nonclinical programme evaluated the safety of GNX in safety pharmacology, 
PK, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (including juvenile toxicity) studies in rats, 
mice, and dogs. The key safety findings from non-clinical studies were 1) CNS-related findings 
(sedation effects) in adult and juvenile animals; 2) cardiovascular findings 3) prolonged 
pregnancies and dystocia; and 4) delayed sexual maturation in juvenile animals. A brief 
description of these findings and their clinical relevance is provided below. 
CNS-related findings (sedation effects) in adult and juvenile animals 
Findings common to all repeat-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats, and dogs were CNS-related 
clinical signs. The sedation effects were reversible; dose dependent in both incidence and 
severity; and followed a predictable pattern. The CNS effects tended to be most severe within the 
first few hours after a daily dose was administered, particularly in the first week of dosing. At 
lower doses, the CNS effects resolved by the next daily dose, suggesting a Cmax driven effect, and 
abated with duration of administration, suggesting tolerance to the sedation effects over time. At 
high doses, the sedation effects were accompanied by clinical signs of bodies being cold to the 
touch, tremors and/or laboured respiration. The sedation effects observed in the toxicology 
studies are consistent with the findings in the modified Irwin test (Study 8396690) and the other 
non-GLP CNS Safety Pharmacology studies (rotarod, locomotor, and cognitive function) 
conducted with GNX. The sedation effects observed following GNX administration were 
attributed to the exaggerated pharmacology of GNX, a positive modulator of GABAA receptors 
(2.4 Nonclinical Overview). 
Similar to findings in nonclinical studies, the adverse events of somnolence and sedation reported 
in clinical studies appeared early in treatment, were dose related, and in some cases diminished 
with continued treatment. In the CDD pivotal study (Study 1042-CDD-3001), somnolence and 
sedation were reported with a higher incidence in GNX-treated subjects (34.0% and 6.0%, 
respectively) compared with placebo-treated subjects (5.9% and 3.9%, respectively). CNS-related 
clinical signs, such as sedation, are a known risk for humans. The SmPC warns that Ztalmy 
causes somnolence and sedation and use with other CNS depressants, including concomitantly 
used anti-seizure medicinal products, could potentiate the somnolence and sedation effect. 
Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines (see SV.1.1). 
Cardiovascular findings 
There were no changes in QTc intervals, blood pressure parameters, or histopathologic correlates. 
GNX did not inhibit human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (hERG) channels at a concentration of 
10 ÂµM (Study 1245-007).  In the 12-month repeat-dose toxicology study in dogs 
(Study 1245-011), a dose-dependent increase in heart rate at â¥3 mg/kg/day (similar to clinical 
exposure levels) was observed and there were incidences of sinus tachycardia at higher doses. In 
a GLP-compliant safety pharmacology study in conscious, telemetered beagle dogs 
(Study 1245-008), there were no alterations in heart rate, or qualitative or quantitative ECG 
parameters attributed to GNX. The NOEL for the cardiovascular endpoints was the highest dose 
tested, 15 mg/kg (2.4 Nonclinical Overview).  
Sinus tachycardia in the 12-month dog study was noted at Cmax values that are 8 to 10-fold higher 
than demonstrated Cmax values in human subjects, which lowers the potential for these findings to 
occur in the clinical setting (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). Overall, nonclinical safety studies 
suggest that GNX is unlikely to have significant cardiovascular safety concerns in humans. No 
cardiovascular risk has been identified in GNX clinical studies. In a Thorough QT study 
(1042-TQT-1001), GNX at maximal concentrations at steady state had no clinically relevant 
effects on cardiac repolarization or other ECG parameters (2.5 Clinical Overview). 
Prolonged pregnancies and dystocia 
In the combined embryo-foetal development and pre- and post-natal development study 
(COY 7/961509) in rats, there was a slight but statistically significant prolongation of gestation 
at 40 mg/kg/day and 1 female in that dose group showed dystocia. Based on this information, 
20 mg/kg/day is considered a reasonable NOAEL for effects of GNX on maternal reproductive 
function. In first generation offspring (F1), reductions in body weight gain and slight delays in 
development occurred in the 40 mg/kg/day group, but there were no effects on behaviour or 
reproductive capacity in the F1 generation as adults. The NOAEL for the study was considered 
20 mg/kg/day based on effects on F1 postnatal growth and development. 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are of limited value since exposure levels 
were far below clinically relevant levels. There are limited data on the use of GNX in pregnant 
women. ZTALMY is not recommended during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing 
potential not using contraception. Use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding is included as 
missing information in the RMP. 
Delayed sexual maturation in juvenile animals 
Two GLP compliant juvenile toxicology studies were conducted in neonatal rats, with dosing 
starting on prenatal Day 7 and continuing for 7 weeks in the first study (Study COY 2/950920) 
and 12 weeks in the second study (Study 00398514). The findings between the 2 studies were 
consistent and demonstrated that responses in juvenile rats were similar to those in adult rats on 
an AUC exposure basis. A significant delay in attainment of sexual maturation occurred in 
females, but this did not result in any effects on oestrous cyclicity or fertility or reproductive 
parameters (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). 
There was no observed effect on sexual maturation or clinically meaningful effect on growth 
(height and weight) in clinical studies with GNX. However, as effects on sexual maturation have 
a longer latency and need to be followed up for a longer period, âlong term safety (including 
sexual maturation and growth)â is included as a potential risk in the RMP ( SVII.3.1.). 
Overall, there were no findings in the nonclinical assessment that would preclude the use of GNX 
in the targeted population. 
M2 Metabolite 
M2 is a metabolite identified in human subjects administered GNX that contributes between 10% 
and 20% of total drug-related material in human plasma. 
M2 was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames Test at concentrations up to 5000 Âµg/plate 
(Study 9603168). However, M2 did elicit statistically significant increases in the incidence of 
aberrant metaphases in the mammalian chromosome aberration assay at concentrations 
â¥256 Âµg/mL (Study 9603173) (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). M2 administration did not cause an 
increase in micronuclei in bone marrow, nor did it increase comet morphology in liver in an 
in vivo genotoxicity Study 9800811. 
In a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study (Study 1020-7461) with M2, microscopic changes 
considered related to the administration of M2 were observed in the seminal vesicles and prostate 
glands of male rats. Minimal to moderate acinar atrophy and decreased secretion were noted 
microscopically in the seminal vesicles and prostate glands of males that received 
â¥50 mg/kg/day, with a dose- related increase in the incidence and/or severity. These findings 
correlated with small seminal vesicles and small prostate glands noted grossly in several male 
animals that received â¥100 mg/kg/day of M2 metabolite, as well as decreased prostate weights in 
animals that received â¥25 mg/kg/day of M2. Similar preliminary findings were observed in a 
13-week rat toxicity study of M2 (Study 1020 7471) which is expected to report in the May 2023. 
In this study, macroscopic changes related to the administration of M2 were observed in the 
prostate gland of males dosed at â¥50 mg/kg/day, and in the seminal vesicles of males dosed at 
100 mg/kg/day with M2, at the end of the main scheduled euthanasia. Microscopic changes 
considered related to the administration of M2 metabolite were also noted in the male sex 
accessory glands, in particular there was a dose-dependent, minimal to moderate decreased 
secretion in the prostate gland of males dosed at â¥50 mg/kg/day, minimal to mild acinar atrophy 
in the seminal vesicles of males dosed at 100 mg/kg/day and minimal to mild decreased secretion 
in the seminal vesicles of males dosed at â¥50 mg/kg/day with M2. 
Findings observed in Study 1020-7461 (acinar atrophy, decreased secretion in the prostate gland 
and seminal vesicle glands, and the corresponding decreased prostate gland weight) occurred at 
levels slightly above clinical exposure levels; the clinical relevance of these findings remains 
unknown. 
A 6-month toxicity study with M2 in rats is ongoing and a 6-month carcinogenicity study in 
transgenic mice with GNX and M2 is planned to start in Q4 2023 to further address the long-term 
safety of GNX and the impact of its metabolite M2. Formal Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) 
assessments to evaluate the need for 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats with GNX and M2 are 
planned for submission in Q2 2024. In addition, the need for a juvenile toxicity study with M2 
will be evaluated in a WoE assessment planned for Q2 2024. An embryo-foetal development 
study with M2 in rats is planned to start in the Q1 2024. These studies are additional 
pharmacovigilance activities and post-authorisation measures (see Part III.2). 
The human metabolite, M2, is not thought to present a safety concern in humans. The compound 
is a close analogue of an endogenous steroid (allopregnanolone) that is found in high levels in 
human plasma and the safety of GNX has been thoroughly evaluated in >1900 human subjects 
with no safety issues (and with presumably high M2 levels). 
M43=M17 Metabolite 
The characterisation of metabolite M43=M17 is not complete and in view of the potential long 
half-life of this metabolite, the long-term safety of this metabolite is currently unknown. Studies 
are planned with M17 to investigate in vitro drug-drug interactions (DDI) and in vivo 
pharmacokinetics (PK) with brain penetrance (see Part III.2). 
 
 
 
Part II:  Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
As of 24 February 2021, 1,837 subjects across 42 completed clinical studies have received at 
least 1 dose of oral GNX, with another 77 subjects exposed to IV GNX and 16 subjects 
administered both oral and IV GNX. Study conduct was completed for 16 Phase 1 single-dose 
studies and 7 Phase 1 multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects (n=417). Patient studies include 
one Phase 1 study in adult migraine, and 18 Phase 2 or 3 studies in adult (partial onset seizures, 
migraine, postpartum depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) and paediatric indications 
(infantile spasms, CDD [double-blind portion only] fragile X, protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) 
[double-blind portion only]). In these studies, oral doses ranged from 50 to 2000 mg/day using 
oral suspension, oral tablet, and oral capsule formulations. Overall, the to-be-marketed oral 
suspension formulation and dose was utilised in 8 Phase 2/3 studies with 381 patients exposed to 
GNX. Of these, 240 were paediatric patients and 141 were adults. 
A summary of the overall patient safety database for all GNX formulations is presented in 
Table 2.

The evaluation of the safety of GNX oral suspension for the adjunctive treatment of seizures 
associated with CDD in patients 2 years of age and older is based primarily on the cumulative 
safety data available from one pivotal Phase 3 study and one supportive Phase 2a study in which 
a total of 102 subjects with CDD received GNX for a mean duration of exposure 351.4 days at 
doses up to the recommended therapeutic dose of 1800 mg/day for subjects weighing >28 kg and 
up to 63 mg/kg/day for subjects weighing â¤28 kg. 
A single data pool, the âAll GNX CDD Populationâ, consists of CDD subjects included in the 
safety populations who had at least 1 dose of the study drug in the following studies (data cut-off 
24 Feb 2021): 
â¢  Study 1042-CDD-3001 
A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive GNX treatment 
in children and young adults with CDD followed by long-term OL treatment 
Of 101 subjects randomised in Study 1042-CDD-3001, 95 (94.1 %) completed the 
17-week double-blind phase; 6 (5.9%) subjects discontinued from the study. The 
percentage of subjects who completed the double-blind phase was slightly higher in the 
GNX group (48/51 [96.0%]) than in the placebo group (47/50 [92.2%]). Overall, a total of 
88 subjects (43 GNX and 45 placebo) continued in the open-label phase. 
â¢  Study 1042-0900 
Open label, proof-of-concept study of GNX in children with PCDH19 female 
paediatric epilepsy and other rare genetic epilepsies 
Seven (7) subjects were enrolled in the CDD cohort of which 4 (57.1%) subjects 
completed the 26-week open-label phase of the study; all 4 subjects entered and 
completed the 52-week open-label extension phase. Subjects who completed the 52-week 
open-label extension and continued to show a clinical response were permitted to continue 
GNX dosing; 1 subject was ongoing at the 24 Feb 2021 cut-off. 
The All GNX CDD Population (n=102) is composed of 50 subjects from Study 1042-CDD-3001 
who received GNX during the double-blind phase (of which 43 continued into the open-label 
phase), 45 subjects from Study 1042-CDD-3001 who first received placebo during the double-
blind phase and then went on to receive GNX during the open-label phase, and 7 CDD subjects 
from Study 1042-0900. The extent of exposure of subjects in the All GNX CDD Population is 
shown in Table 4. The mean duration of exposure was 351.4 days (minimum 14 days, maximum 
1337 days, median 358.5 days). Modal dose for most subjects was the target dose of 1800 mg/day 
for subjects >28 kg or 63 mg/kg/day for subjects â¤28 kg (see Table 5).

Part II:  Module SIV - Populations not studied in clinical trials  
SIV.1 
Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the 
development programme 
Exclusion criteria from Study 1042-CDD-3001 are detailed below: 
Exclusion criteria whose purpose is to ensure standardisation of the trial population that are 
common to most clinical trials are not discussed in this section, including: 
â¢  Previous exposure to GNX (i.e., the medicinal product under investigation) 
â¢  Exposure to any other investigational drug within 30 days or less than 5 half-lives prior to 
screening. 
â¢  Known sensitivity or allergy to any component in the investigational medicinal product, 
progesterone, or other related steroid compounds. 
Exclusion criteria related to ongoing or recent conditions or treatments that may interfere with the 
study results and impact the safety and efficacy assessment of GNX are similarly not discussed, 
including: 
â¢  Concurrent use of ACTH, prednisone or other glucocorticoid was not permitted, nor use 
of moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7. Moderate or strong inducer 
or inhibitor anti-epileptic drugs were allowed (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc.)  
â¢  Subjects on ACTH, prednisone or other systemically (non-inhaled) administered steroids 
were to be off the product greater than 28 days prior to screening.  
â¢  Subjects with a positive result on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) test 
(via urine or plasma drug screen) at the screening visit, and a positive result on THC or 
CBD test (via plasma) at the baseline visit without prescription for Epidyolex in epilepsy 
were excluded from the study. Concomitant Epidyolex (CBD) use was allowed in the 
double-blind phase provided the subject had been on a stable dose for at least 1 month 
prior to screening and was expected to remain on a stable dose without a foreseeable 
change for the duration of the double-blind phase. THC and/or CBD were allowed in the 
open-label phase. 
â¢  Use of dietary supplements or herbal preparations were not permitted if subject had been 
using them consistently for less than 3 months prior to screening or did not plan to remain 
on stable doses for the duration of the double-blind phase. Use of St. Johnâs Wort was not 
permitted. 
â¢  Changes in anti-epileptic drugs within the last month prior to screening: All AEDs must 
have been stable in dose for at least 1-month prior to screening unless otherwise noted.  
â¢  Any disease or condition (medical or surgical; other than CDKL5) at screening that might 
have compromised the haematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, 
or hepatic systems; or other conditions that might have interfered with absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the investigational product, or would have placed 
the subject at increased risk. 
Exclusion criteria identified for discussion are presented below: 
West Syndrome with hypsarrhythmia pattern on EEG or seizures predominantly of 
Infantile Spasms (IS) type; if EEG pattern/seizure type is uncertain, study inclusion should 
be reviewed and determined by the sponsor/sponsor delegate. 
Reason for exclusion: West syndrome is a constellation of symptoms characterised by 
epileptic/infantile spasms, abnormal brain wave patterns called hypsarrhythmia and sometimes 
intellectual disability (NORD 2020). Any disorder that can lead to brain damage can be an 
underlying cause of West syndrome including a mutation in the CDKL5 gene. Patients with 
known West syndrome were excluded from the study to avoid confounding factors that might 
impact the assessment of the efficacy and safety of GNX in the genetically defined CDD patient 
population. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: GNX is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with 
CDD in patients 2 years of age and older, as specified in the ZTALMY SmPC. Patients with 
West syndrome will not be treated unless identified as having a mutation in the CDKL5 gene and 
hence diagnosed with CDD. 
Active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease, or CNS 
disease deemed progressive as evaluated by brain imaging (MRI). 
Reason for exclusion: CDD is a complex epileptic encephalopathy. The translational product of 
the CDKL5 gene is a protein of the serine-threonine kinase family. Changes in the level of 
CDKL5 protein suggest an important role in the process of neuronal formation and maturation. 
Although the exact molecular role of the protein has not been precisely defined, it is currently 
known that it is involved in proliferation, neuronal migration, neuronal formation, and neuronal 
growth, as well as in the development and functioning of synapses in brain maturation. Severe 
forms of epileptic encephalopathy include attacks not responsive to drug therapy, microcephaly, 
profound mental and psychomotor retardation, generalised hypotonia, and cortical vision 
disorders (Jakimiec 2020). Despite abnormal neuroimages being observed under MRI of CDD 
patients the changes are not very specific and are mostly related to (frontal) brain atrophy and 
white matter enhancement, mainly involving temporal lobes. Such abnormalities occur in many 
other neurological conditions and diseases and, therefore, cannot be used as the basis for 
diagnosis, differentiation, or prognosis of CDD. Patients with active CNS infection, 
demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease, or progressive CNS disease were 
excluded from the study to avoid confounding factors that might impact the assessment of the 
efficacy and safety of GNX. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: In clinical practice, patients with active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, 
degenerative neurological disease, or progressive CNS disease are not indicated for treatment 
with GNX. Adjunctive treatment of patients with epileptic seizures associated with CDD is the 
proposed indication for ZTALMY. 
Unwillingness to withhold grapefruit, Seville oranges or star fruit from diet during the 
entire clinical trial. 
Reason for exclusion: GNX is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The effect of grapefruit 
juice varies widely among brands and is concentration-, dose-, and preparation-dependent. 
Studies have shown that grapefruit juice, Seville orange juice and star fruit juice inhibit CYP3A 
isozymes. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Inhibition of CYP3A4 has been shown to have mild to no effect on the exposure to 
GNX (Study 1042-DDI-1001). Following coadministration of GNX with itraconazole, a strong 
CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, the AUC0-inf of GNX was increased by 17% and Cmax was relatively 
unchanged (2.5 Clinical Overview, Section 3.2.4.2). In Study 1042-0115, results showed that 
grapefruit juice increases GNX Cmax and AUC by 2- and 2.6-fold, respectively in the fasted state; 
however, the increased exposure did not reach the plasma concentration for GNX achieved in the 
fed condition, which was 4.2-fold for Cmax and 2.8-fold for AUC (2.5 Clinical Overview, Section 
3.2.4.2). However, since itraconazole has only a small effect on the PK of GNX and 
grapefruit/Seville orange/starfruit juices are weaker inhibitors, affecting primarily only intestinal 
enzymes (versus intestinal and hepatic enzymes for itraconazole), these fruits are no longer 
expected to have an effect on the PK of GNX. 
Patients treated with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors can be monitored and any adverse reactions 
experienced by patients in clinical practice will be managed by guidance in the ZTALMY SmPC 
whereby ZTALMY should be titrated gradually to achieve the recommended daily dose. 
Physicians experienced in treating patients who are on concomitant medicinal products should 
evaluate the need for dose adjustments of ZTALMY or of the concomitant medicinal product(s) 
to manage potential drug interactions. 
Unwillingness to withhold alcohol throughout the entire clinical trial. 
Reason for exclusion: GNX can cause somnolence and sedation. These adverse reactions appear 
early in treatment and are dose-related; symptoms may decrease with continued treatment. 
Alcohol is a CNS depressant and could potentiate the somnolence and sedation effect. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: In animal models, GNX has been shown to potentiate the effects of alcohol in a similar 
manner to that of benzodiazepines and valproic acid. Concomitant use of ZTALMY with CNS 
depressants (including alcohol) may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence. However, no 
reports of adverse effects with GNX and alcohol in adult epileptic subjects have been reported. 
The ZTALMY SmPC specifies that patients should be prohibited from drinking alcohol during 
treatment with ZTALMY. 
Active suicidal plan/intent or active suicidal thoughts in the past 6 months or a suicide 
attempt in the past 3 years. 
Reason for exclusion: As specified in the ZTALMY SmPC, AEDs have a class warning 
regarding an increased risk of suicidality and patients with epilepsy are known to have an 
elevated risk for suicide as compared to population controls. Suicidal behaviour and ideation have 
been reported in patients treated with AEDs in several indications. A meta-analysis of 
randomised placebo-controlled trials with AEDs has shown a small increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Patients with known suicidal 
tendencies were excluded from the study to avoid confounding factors that might impact the 
assessment of the efficacy and safety of GNX and to reduce the risk of premature discontinuation 
from the study. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: GNX acts by increasing seizure threshold and blocking seizure propagation and is 
classed as an AED. Clinical trial data do not support an increased risk of suicidality in subjects 
treated with GNX. The ZTALMY SmPC advises patientâs caregivers to monitor for signs of 
suicidal behaviour and ideation, or self-harm behaviour during treatment with GNX and when 
changes in the treatment regimen become necessary. Caregivers should be advised to seek 
medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation, or self-harm emerge. 
Pregnant or breastfeeding 
Reason for exclusion: Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(Module SII). It is not known if GNX crosses the placenta. As specified in the ZTALMY SmPC, 
GNX and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A milk excretion study conducted in five 
healthy adult lactating women treated with a 300 mg oral dose of GNX showed GNX 
concentrations in breast milk to be approximately 4-fold higher than in plasma. The calculated 
maximum relative infant dose for GNX is approximately 0.157 mg/kg/day based on an average 
milk intake of 150 mL/kg/day, which is less than 1% of the maternal dose, and approximately 
0.24% the labelled paediatric dose of 63 mg/kg/day. The effect of GNX on breastfed 
newborns/infants is unknown. As a precautionary measure, pregnant or breastfeeding patients 
were excluded from the clinical development programme, as is the case for the majority of 
investigative clinical trials. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes 
Plasma allopregnanolone sulphate (Allo-S) levels â¥ 6.0 ng/mL at the screening visit. 
Reason for exclusion: Plasma allopregnanolone-sulphate (Allo-S) was hypothesized to be a 
predictive biomarker of the anti-epileptic treatment effect of GNX in patients with PCDH19-
related epilepsy, which is caused by an inherited mutation of the PCDH19 gene located on the 
X chromosome. This gene encodes for a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule 
(PCDH19) that is expressed in the CNS and which appears to be involved in synaptic 
transmission and formation of synaptic connections during brain development (Depienne 2009). 
An anticonvulsant treatment effect signal of GNX in PCDH19-related epilepsy has emerged from 
an ongoing open-label flexible-dose exploratory study (Study 1042-0900) of GNX in children 
(age range 2-15 years) with rare genetic epilepsies with uncontrolled seizures despite multiple 
AED regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02358538). In a PCDH19 patient cohort, 
distinctly different Allo-S levels were observed between responders, defined as a â¥25% decrease 
in seizure rate, and non-responders. Responders and non-responders had mean (Â± SD) plasma 
Allo-S concentrations of 501 Â±430 pg/mL and 9,829 Â±6,638 pg/mL, respectively. Subjects with 
high Allo-S are considered less likely to respond to GNX treatment. Patients with Allo-S levels 
â¥6.0 ng/ml at the screening visit were excluded from the Phase 3 study to avoid confounding 
factors that might impact the assessment of the efficacy of GNX in patients with CDD-related 
epilepsy. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Preliminary analysis of a subsequent placebo-controlled study in PCDH19-related 
epilepsy (Study 1042-PCDH19-3002) did not demonstrate a treatment response based on the 
putative biomarker, Allo-S. Similarly, the Phase 3 CDD study (1042-CDD-3001) has 
demonstrated that Allo-S levels do not predict treatment response and failed to support the 
original hypothesis. Patients with epileptic seizures associated with CDD will not be assessed for 
Allo-S levels prior to treatment with GNX. All patients to be treated will have ZTALMY titrated 
gradually over 4 weeks to allow for assessment of clinical response and tolerability in the process 
of attaining the recommended daily dose. 
Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than 3 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) at study entry. If AST or ALT increases >3 times ULN during 
the study, subject should be followed with weekly laboratory repeat testing and continue in 
study if levels trending down. Subject will be discontinued if levels do not decline to under 3 
x ULN. 
Total bilirubin levels greater than ULN at study entry. In cases of documented, stable 
medical condition (i.e., Gilbertâs Syndrome) resulting in levels of total bilirubin greater 
than ULN, the medical monitor can determine if a protocol exception can be made. If total 
bilirubin increases to 1.5 x ULN or more during study, the subject will be discontinued. 
Reason for exclusion: The influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of GNX had not been 
studied prior to the start of Study 1042-CDD-3001. As GNX is thought to be primarily cleared 
through hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment would be expected to influence the PK of GNX 
and to increase exposure to GNX. Therefore, patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment were excluded from the study to avoid confounding factors that might impact the 
assessment of the efficacy and safety of GNX.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: 
The influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of GNX was investigated in a Phase 1, open-label 
hepatic impairment study (Study 1042 IHF-1001). The clinical study report (CSR) was completed 
on the 09 December 2022. No clinically significant effects on the exposures of GNX were 
observed following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg in patients with mild (Child-
Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) 
hepatic impairment had an approximately 5.8-fold increase in AUC0-inf compared to those with 
normal hepatic function. The SmPC informs that the initial target dose should be one-half the 
recommended target dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Specific 
dose titration tables for patients with severe hepatic impairment are provided. Higher or lower 
doses of GNX may be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment based on individual 
clinical response and tolerability. Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild (Child-
Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. 
Subjects with significant renal insufficiency, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
<30 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or Paediatric GFR calculator or 
Bedside Schwartz), were excluded from study entry or discontinued if the criterion was met 
post baseline. 
Reason for exclusion: GNX is excreted in both faeces and urine, with the majority excreted in the 
faeces. Patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment were excluded from the study to 
avoid confounding factors that might impact the assessment of the efficacy and safety of GNX.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: A Phase 1, open-label renal impairment study (Study 1042-IRF-1001) has completed. 
The study demonstrated that for both GNX and unbound GNX, the rate and extent of absorption 
for subjects with normal renal function were numerically only slightly greater than or similar to 
those with severe renal impairment suggesting no impact on exposure for renally impaired 
subjects. This is further corroborated by the low estimate of the slope (Î²) on the impact of eGFR 
and creatinine clearance observed, suggesting no correlation between renal impairment and eGFR 
and creatinine clearance following oral dose administration of GNX. Further, oral GNX at a dose 
of 300 mg was safe and well tolerated in this study with no observed relationship in reporting of 
adverse events and GNX. There was 1 reported adverse event (back pain) in the severe renal 
impairment group that was mild in intensity and considered not related to the study drug. No 
subjects discontinued as a result of an adverse event or abnormal safety assessment finding. The 
ZTALMY SmPC advises that patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment can be 
administered ZTALMY without dose adjustment.  
SIV.2 
Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial 
development programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure.  
As of 24 February 2021, 102 unique subjects with CDD (All GNX CDD Population) have 
received treatment with GNX ranging in duration from 14 days to 1337 days (median duration 
358.5 days), with doses ranging from 457 to 2057 mg/day. Adverse reactions with a frequency 
greater than 1 in 34 could be detected and quantified assuming the background incidence of the 
adverse event is zero.  
Alternatively, considering the 1135 GNX-treated patients (All GNX Subjects) regardless of 
indication, from studies where datasets are available (see Module SIII), adverse reactions with a 
frequency greater than 1 in 378 could be quantified in a data set of this size.

Patients with relevant comorbidities: 
â¢  Patients with hepatic

In the clinical development programme patients were included if they 
had adequate hepatic function at study entry (AST and ALT â¤3 x ULN; 
bilirubin â¤ULN). If AST or ALT increased >3 x ULN during the study, 
subject was followed with weekly laboratory repeat testing and 
continued in study if levels were trending down. Subject was 
discontinued if levels did not decline to <3 x ULN. Patients with stable 
Gilbertâs Syndrome resulting in bilirubin levels >ULN could be 
included if the medical monitor considered a protocol exception could 
be made. If total bilirubin increased to â¥1.5 x ULN during study, the 
subject was discontinued. (Module SIV.1). 
All subjects in the GNX treatment group in Study 1042-CDD-3001 had 
adequate hepatic function. However, the CSR for a Phase 1 hepatic 
impairment study in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe 
impairment along with matched controls was completed on 
09 Dec 2022 and dosage recommendations for patients with hepatic 
impairment are included in the SmPC (Module SIV.1).

In the clinical development programme patients were included if they 
had adequate renal function at study entry (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate [eGFR] â¥30 mL/min) (Module SIV.1).  
GNX is biotransformed primarily by hepatic metabolism and a 
significant increase in exposure is not expected in subjects with renal 
insufficiency. To further characterise the use of GNX in patients with 
renal impairment, a Phase 1 study of oral GNX in subjects with renal 
impairment compared with matched normal controls was initiated after 
the 24 Feb 2021 data cut-off for this RMP and has completed. The 
study demonstrated that for both GNX and unbound GNX, the rate and 
extent of absorption for subjects with normal renal function were 
numerically only slightly greater than or similar to those with severe 
renal impairment suggesting no impact on exposure for renally 
impaired subjects. 
Patients with any disease or condition at screening that might 
compromise the cardiovascular system; were excluded from 
participation (Module SIV.1). 
In the GNX clinical development programme no cardiovascular risk has 
been identified (Module SII). 
None of the exclusion criteria prohibited immunocompromised 
subjects. 
Not included in the clinical development programme. 
Study 1042-CDD-3001 (n=101) comprised subjects who were White 
(92%), Asian (5%) and Other (3%) and mainly Not Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity (86%). Ten percent (10%) of subjects were Hispanic/Latino 
with 2% of unknown ethnicity and 2% not reported (2.7.4 Summary of 
Clinical Safety, Table 16) 
The baseline demographics of subjects treated with GNX in the clinical 
development programme by ethnicity are presented in Table 7 (Module 
SIII). 
Not applicable. All recruited patients had molecular confirmation of a 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant. 
The genetic test classification for subjects participating in Study 1042-

Part II:  Module SV - Post-authorisation experience    
SV.1 
Post-authorisation exposure 
GNX was granted approval in the United States in March 2022. GNX has not been approved in 
any country outside of the United States. The data lock point for this RMP (24 February 2021) is 
prior to both approval and launch of GNX in the United States; there are minimal available post-
marketing exposure data to present.

Part II:  Module SVI - Additional EU requirements for the safety 
specification 
SVI.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
GNX is associated with CNS-effects and therefore adverse events associated with abuse 
(e.g., euphoric mood, somnolence, dizziness) have been reported with GNX treatment. No 
intentional overdose abuse or misuse of GNX has been reported to date.  
A validated clinical study was performed to evaluate the abuse potential of single oral doses of 
GNX in healthy recreational CNS depressant users (1042-HAP-1001). GNX at doses of up to a 
supratherapeutic dose of 2000 mg showed significantly less abuse potential compared with 
lorazepam (6 mg). Subjective effects of GNX peaked between 1 to 3 hours post-dose, but were 
relatively transient, generally lasting approximately 6 hours post-dose compared with 12 hours 
post-dose with lorazepam 6 mg. Effects of GNX on cognitive or motor impairment were small, 
sporadic, and markedly lower than those of lorazepam. 
Regarding absolute abuse potential, GNX 400 mg produced responses that showed similar abuse 
potential to placebo; however, GNX 800 and 2000 mg each produced responses that were not 
similar to those of placebo. GNX 400 mg was not significantly different from placebo on key 
secondary endpoints (Overall Drug Liking visual analogue scale (VAS) maximum effect (Emax) 
and Take Drug Again VAS Emax), but did show significantly greater positive, sedative, and other 
effects compared with placebo. GNX 800 and 2000 mg showed significantly greater effects 
compared with placebo on the key secondary endpoints, as well as measures of positive, sedative, 
and other drug effects. GNX was not associated with significant negative effects at any dose level 
(2.5 Clinical Overview, Section 3.5.3). 
In Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) pharmacology studies that assessed drug abuse liability, the 
responses elicited with GNX are consistent with Schedule IV drugs (drugs characterised with a 
low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence, such as benzodiazepines). Recently, GNX 
was placed in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of the United States. Schedule 
V controlled substances have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule 
IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics (DEA 
2022). 
Whilst the potential for abuse is considered minimal, the ZTALMY SmPC includes a warning 
that ZTALMY has potential for abuse. GNX shares an internal/subjective interoceptive cue with 
benzodiazepines and dose-dependently supported self-administration in a rodent model of 
reward, suggested GNX has reinforcing characteristics similar to benzodiazepines.

Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP  
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP: 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated: 
â¢  None 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered to by 
prescribers (e.g., actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state 
where the product is authorised): 
â¢  Somnolence and sedation 
GNX is a methyl analogue of the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a derivative of 
progesterone. It is a neuroactive steroid that allosterically positively modulates GABAA 
receptors (comprised of Î± and Î³ units) in the CNS at sites that are distinct from other allosteric 
GABAA receptor modulators, such as benzodiazepines (Campo-Soria 2006). GNX also 
modulates extrasynaptic GABAA receptors that are comprised of Î± and Î´ subunits (Belelli 
2006; Belelli 2005). CNS-related effects are not unanticipated based on the mechanism of 
action of GNX and in this way GNX can exhibit anticonvulsant activity as well as sedative 
effects. 
In Study 1042-CDD-3001 (double-blind phase) GNX caused somnolence and sedation in 
36.0% and 6.0%, respectively, of patients treated with GNX, compared with 15.7% and 3.9%, 
respectively, of patients treated with placebo (Table 10). Adverse reactions of somnolence 
andsedation appear early in treatment and are dose-related, and symptoms may diminish with 
continued treatment. In the open-label phase of Study 1042-CDD-3001, where all subjects 
received GNX, TEAEs were similar to the double-blind phase with somnolence (18.2%) 
being the second most frequently observed. Somnolence was reported by a higher proportion 
of subjects in the double-blind placebo group compared with the double-blind GNX group 
(22.2% vs 14.0%) which is consistent with these events occurring early in treatment or 
reducing with long-term treatment (2.5 Clinical Overview, Section 5.4.2). 
A cut-off of â¥2% of participants of the All GNX CDD Population was used to define the most 
frequent TEAEs. In the All GNX CDD Population (n=102), somnolence was the most 
frequently reported TEAE (30 [29.4%] GNX subjects vs 8 [15.7%] placebo; Table 10). TEAE 
PTs related to somnolence such as of sedation (4 [3.9%] subjects), hypersomnia (4 [3.9%] 
subjects), and lethargy (4 [3.9%] subjects) were also reported (vs 3.9%, 0%, and 3.9% for 
placebo subjects, respectively). (Table 10; 2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety Table 30).

When a more recent cut of the data (22 June 2021) was analysed the TEAE profile in the All 
GNX CDD population was consistent with that of the earlier data cutoff. (23 February 2021). 
The same TEAEs were the most common and remained in the same ranking of frequency. 
The median treatment duration was 358.5 and 119.0 days, respectively, for GNX-treated 
subjects versus placebo group, a 3-fold difference in extent of exposure. In the All GNX CDD 
Population (N=102), following adjustment for duration of treatment exposure, TEAEs 
occurred at a lower rate of 6.66/year (95% CI 6.17, 7.19) versus 11.01/year (95% CI 9.49, 
12.77) for the placebo group (N=51). Specifically, the rates for the CNS-related TEAEs of 
somnolence, lethargy and sedation were all lower in GNX-treated subjects than those 
observed in placebo treated subjects (N=51) (0.4 vs 0.5, 0.05 vs 0.13 and 0.04 vs 0.13, 
respectively). Hypersomnia occurred at a higher rate (0.04 vs 0), with no difference in rate for 
gait disturbance (0.06) and no events of dizziness reported in either GNX-treated or placebo 
groups (RMP TLFs, Table 6A).

the end of the study period. Special attention will be needed for subjects who were assigned to placebo during 
double-blind phase, as their reference dates for TEAEs were different during the double-blind period and open-

Most TEAEs reported in the All GNX CDD Population were mild or moderate in severity 
(24.5% and 46.1%, respectively). A total of 21 (20.6%) subjects in the All GNX CDD 
Population reported severe TEAEs (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.4). 
Overall, 6 (5.9%) subjects reported serious drug-related TEAEs in the All GNX CDD 
Population with one case each for the TEAEs of somnolence, lethargy and gait disturbance 
(2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.6.2). 
Specifically, in the double-blind phase of Study 1042-CDD-3001 the most frequent study 
drug related, according to the investigator, TEAE by PT was somnolence and was reported by 
higher proportions of subjects in the GNX group compared to placebo group (17 [34.0%] vs 3 
[5.9%]) (Table 12). 
The most frequently reported drug-related TEAE in the All GNX CDD Population was 
somnolence (27 [26.5%] subjects) and PTs related to somnolence such as sedation (4 [3.9%] 
subjects), hypersomnia (3 [2.9%] subjects), and lethargy (3 [2.9%] subjects) were also 
reported (Table 12). Most drug-related TEAEs reported in the All GNX CDD Population 
were mild or moderate in severity (21 [20.6%] and 33 [32.4%] subjects, respectively). Seven 
(6.9%) subjects reported severe drug-related TEAEs in the All GNX CDD Population, of 
which one was somnolence, and one was hypersomnia These TEAEs are consistent with 
GNXâs CNS effects and were reported in previous studies with GNX (2.7.4 Summary of 
Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.4).

The number of subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was 26 (25.5%) in the All 
GNX CDD Population (vs 5 [9.8%] for placebo). Overall, six (5.9%) subjects reported drug-
related treatment-emergent SAEs in the All GNX CDD Population of which one subject 
experienced moderate somnolence along with dysphagia and hypotonia (both moderate 
severity) (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.6.2). 
A total of 13 (12.7%) subjects in the All GNX CDD Population have discontinued study drug 
due to TEAEs. Somnolence was the second most common TEAE leading to discontinuation 
(3 [2.9%] subjects). Hypersomnia led to discontinuation of study drug in 1 (1.0%) subject, 
with no TEAEs of sedation, lethargy, or gait disturbance leading to treatment discontinuation 
being reported (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Table 50). 
Somnolence was the most frequent TEAE leading to dose reduction or temporary study drug 
discontinuation (8 [7.8%] subjects) in the All GNX CDD Population and PTs related to 
somnolence such as sedation and hypersomnia (1 [1.0%] subject each) were also reported. 
2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.7.3). 
Somnolence was numerically higher in non-Hispanic subjects, but the small number of 
Hispanic subjects makes interpretation difficult. In general, the small numbers of subjects 
â¥12 years old, male, other race, Hispanic, and >28 kg weight category dosing hinders 
detection of meaningful differences by these subgroups (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, 
Section 5.1.3). 
In general, the CNS effects of somnolence and sedation were typically non-serious, mild to 
moderate in intensity, appeared early in treatment, were self-limiting, dose-related, and 
reversible. The frequency, severity, and seriousness of these events were consistent with the 
previous GNX clinical experience, indicating that these events are not specific for the CDD 
population. 
Sedative complications occur with any number of AEDs and neurologists are sufficiently 
familiar with the management of the sedative effects of AEDs to be able to manage these 
adverse reactions during clinical practice. Somnolence and sedation are not an important risk 
of GNX as these reactions can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional 
awareness of the precautions to take with AEDs and adhering to the guidance in the 
ZTALMY SmPC. 
The ZTALMY SmPC advises physicians that, based on individual clinical response and 
tolerability, any patient not tolerating the next dose step can be maintained at the lower dose 
for additional days before advancing to the next dose. If the next dose is still not tolerated, 
patients can drop back to the previous lower dose. In addition, although the recommendation 
is to administer the total daily dosage in 3 equal doses throughout the day, if this is not 
tolerated by a patient, the dose can be adjusted to manage symptoms such as somnolence, 
provided that the total daily dose is administered.  
Somnolence and sedation are included in the special warnings and precautions section of the 
ZTALMY SmPC, which also advises that other CNS depressants, including concomitantly 
used anti-seizure medicinal products, opioids, antidepressants, and alcohol, could potentiate 
the somnolence and sedation effect. 
In addition, the ZTALMY SmPC specifies that ZTALMY has a moderate to major influence 
on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause somnolence, sedation, and 
sedation-related adverse reactions, such as fatigue and ataxia, and other CNS-related events 
such as dizziness. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines. 
â¢  Rash 
Rash is a common side effect of several AEDs. In the GNX development programme rash 
adverse events were identified as warranting special attention to better characterise the safety 
profile of the study drug. Rash was considered an Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) 
(Protocol 1042-CDD-3001; IB 07 Dec 2020) due to the structural and pharmacologic 
similarity of GNX to endogenous allopregnanolone which is derived from progesterone, and 
which is associated with autoimmune dermatitis and rash. Even though GNX lacks classical 
steroid hormone effects, and the 3-Ã substitution of a methyl group prevents back-
transformation of GNX to steroid intermediates, its structural similarity to pregnanolone 
prompted monitoring of rash as an AESI (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 1.1.2). 
Only 2 SAEs of rash have been reported in the GNX development programme; during the 
most recent DSUR reporting period (11 Oct 2019 to 10 Oct 2020) no subjects treated with 
either GNX or placebo reported SAEs of rash. Of the 2 reported SAEs to date, one of the 
events resolved after discontinuation of the study drug. The second SAE was reported in the 
ongoing trial 1042-0900 and the event was resolving as of 10 Oct 2020. There have been no 
cases of Stevens Johnson syndrome or other clinically important skin toxicities reported in the 
GNX clinical development programme. In the All GNX CDD Population (n=102) 7 (6.9%) 
subjects reported rash versus 4 (7.8%) subjects in the placebo group. In Study 1042-CDD-
3001 (double-blind phase), rash was the most common treatment-emergent AESI by PT, 
reported in 3 subjects in the GNX group and 2 subjects in the placebo group (2.7.4 Summary 
of Clinical Safety, Section 2.1.7.2). 
In the All GNX CDD Population (N=102), following adjustment for duration of treatment 
exposure, rash occurred at a lower rate of 0.08/year (95% CI 0.04, 0.16) versus 0.25/year 
(95% CI 0.09, 0.67) for the placebo group (N=51) (RMP TLFs, Table 6A). 
Overall, the accumulated evidence suggests that the cases of treatment-emergent skin rashes 
reported do not differ from non-serious rashes that are relatively commonly encountered and 
there has not been evidence to date of significant autoimmune skin reactions to GNX. Given 
the paucity of evidence and the absence of a safety signal, there are insufficient grounds to 
retain rash as an AESI or as an important potential risk, nor does the evidence suggest a 
causal association between the administration of GNX and the occurrence of rash. 
Furthermore, there is no evidence that history of allergic reactions in the CDD population 
predisposed subjects to later skin reactions when taking GNX (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical 
Safety, Section 2.1.7.2). 
â¢  Drug interactions with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers 
Drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers is not an important risk of 
GNX as these can be managed in clinical practice, through increased awareness of potential 
interactions and recommendations in the ZTALMY SmPC.  
The changes in GNX exposures when coadministered with strong, moderate, or weak 
CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant. Coadministration of GNX 
with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the GNX AUC by 17% in healthy 
subjects (the Cmax was unchanged).   
Concomitant use of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased the AUC0-inf of GNX by 
approximately 57-68%. Enzyme inducing antiepileptics (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, and primidone) and St. Johnâs Wort may result in similarly lower plasma 
exposures of GNX. In patients on a stable dose of GNX or in patients initiating or increasing 
the dose of concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs or St. Johnâs Wort, a dose 
increase may be necessary; however, the maximum daily dose must not be exceeded. 
AEDs that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine and phenytoin) have been 
administered concomitantly with GNX in clinical studies. 
â¢  Ethanol interaction 
In animal models, GNX has been shown to potentiate the effects of alcohol in a similar 
manner to that of benzodiazepines and valproic acid. Concomitant use of GNX with CNS 
depressants (including alcohol) may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence. Patients 
should not use alcohol during treatment with ZTALMY.

SVII.1.2. 
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
There are no identified risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns for 
GNX. 
 
Important Potential Risk 1: Long term safety (including sexual maturation and growth) 
Risk-benefit impact: 
In non-clinical studies, a delay in sexual maturation and growth were observed at exposure levels 
that were similar or lower to clinical exposure levels. The observed delay in sexual maturation 
did not result in any effects on reproductive capability as adults (Module SII). Available clinical 
data and the duration of exposure are limited (SVII.3.1.). Effects on sexual maturation and 
growth need to be followed up for a longer period considering that these potential adverse events 
will have a longer latency.  
ZTALMY is subject to additional monitoring to allow quick identification of new safety 
information. Furthermore, additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to further 
characterise the important potential risk of long term safety (including delay in sexual maturation 
and growth) (Part III.2). 
The benefit of GNX as adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients 
who are often subject to frequent and debilitating daily seizures may outweigh the concern of 
long-term use of GNX. The risk to patients with long-term use of ZTALMY is currently not 
known. 
Important Potential Risk 2: Suicidal behaviour and ideation 
AEDs have a class warning about an increased risk of suicidality. Patients with epilepsy are at 
elevated risk for suicide as compared to population controls (Christensen 2007). In a 
comprehensive search of the entire GNX clinical development programme including completed 
and ongoing studies, a total of 9 reports of suicidality were identified in >1600 subjects exposed 
to GNX. In completed placebo-controlled studies, 1 (0.1%) TEAE of suicidality (PT Suicidal 
ideation) occurred in the GNX group (N=1101) while 3 TEAEs (0.4%; Suicidal ideation [2] and 
Suicide attempt [1]) occurred in the placebo group (N=743) (GNX IB, 03 Jun 2021, Table 56). 
Specifically, in subjects with epilepsy in completed placebo-controlled studies there were no 
TEAEs of suicidality in the GNX group (N=325) and 1 (0.4%) TEAE (Suicidal ideation) in the 
placebo group (N=274) (GNX IB, 03 Jun 2021, Table 59). 
In the All GNX CDD Population (N=102), following adjustment for duration of treatment 
exposure, both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt had a zero rate per year; the placebo group 
(N=51) also had a zero rate for these TEAEs (RMP TLFs, Table 6A). 
Suicidality has been reported in open-label GNX studies in 3 subjects with epilepsy and in 3 
subjects with postpartum depression. For the 3 subjects with epilepsy, all were also receiving 1 to 
3 AEDs at the time of the event; all 3 subjects with postpartum depression reported active 
suicidal ideations at 1 time point each and the subsequent visit results returned to baseline. In a 
Phase 3 trial (Study 1042-0603) of GNX in treatment refractory focal onset seizures, shifts to the 
category of any suicidal ideation or behaviour assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS) during the study were very infrequent and were similar for both the GNX and 
placebo groups (GNX IB, 03 Jun 2021).  
Risk-benefit impact:  
The benefit of GNX as adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients 
who are often subject to frequent and debilitating daily seizures outweighs the important potential 
risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation that has yet to be confirmed in patients treated with GNX 
and can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional awareness of the 
precautions to take with AEDs and adhering to the guidance in the ZTALMY SmPC. 
The ZTALMY SmPC informs healthcare professionals that suicidal behaviour and ideation have 
been reported in patients treated with AEDs in several indications. A meta-analysis of 
randomised placebo-controlled trials with AEDs has shown a small increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour and ideation. However, the mechanism of this risk is unknown, and the available data 
do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk with GNX.  
Patientâs caregivers are advised to monitor for signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation, or self-
harm behaviour during treatment with GNX and when changes in the treatment regimen become 
necessary. Caregivers should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal 
behaviour and ideation, or self-harm emerge. 
Missing information 1: Use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding 
There are limited data on use of GNX in pregnant women since pregnant or breastfeeding 
patients were excluded from the clinical development programme (Module SIV.1; Module 
SIV.3). Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of GNX and its 
metabolites in milk. A milk excretion study conducted in five healthy adult lactating women 
treated with a 300 mg oral dose of GNX showed GNX concentrations in breast milk to be 
approximately 4-fold higher than in plasma (Module SIV.1). 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The benefit of GNX as adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients 
who are often subject to frequent and debilitating daily seizures may outweigh the use of GNX in 
pregnancy and during breastfeeding based on an individual risk-benefit assessment conducted by 
the prescriber. The risk to pregnant women and mothers nursing an infant are currently not 
known. 
The ZTALMY SmPC informs healthcare professionals that there are limited data on the use of 
GNX in pregnant women whilst animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive 
toxicity. ZTALMY is not recommended during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing 
potential not using contraception. 
Furthermore, the ZTALMY SmPC specifies that GNX and its metabolites are excreted in human 
milk. However, since the effect of GNX on breastfed newborns/infants is unknown, healthcare 
professionals must decide whether the patient should discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue 
ZTALMY therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
There are no identified risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns for 
GNX. 
 
Important Potential Risk 1: long term safety (including delayed sexual maturation and 
growth) 
Potential mechanisms: 
Ganaxolone has the same core structure as allopregnanolone, but with the addition of a 3Î²-methyl 
group to prevent enzymatic conversion to an entity (i.e., 3-keto) active at nuclear progesterone 
receptors. GNX is a neuroactive steroid that positively and allosterically modulates gamma-
aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). 
A study investigating circulating levels of allopregnalone in children of different ages suggested 
that allopregnalone may be involved in adaptive neuroendocrine mechanisms related to puberty 
(Fadalti 1999). However, a mechanism whereby GNX may cause a delay in sexual maturity and 
growth is not known. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Decreased bodyweight gain and a significant delay in sexual maturation was observed in 
non-clinical studies. However, the observed delay in sexual maturation did not result in any 
effects on reproductive capability as adults. The human relevance of these findings is unknown at 
present as there are insufficient clinical safety data to assess adverse effects with a long latency or 
long term use effects. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Clinical safety data generated to date from healthy volunteers, adult and paediatric patients show 
no significant toxicity for GNX and a lack of hormonal effects suggesting a lack of hormonal 
impact on bone density. There were no effects observed on steroidal reproductive hormones in 
rats and dogs following repeated dosing. 
Non-clinically, there was a significant delay in sexual maturation. However, this this did not 
affect oestrous cyclicity or any fertility or reproductive parameters (Part II:Module SII). 
In 2 juvenile animal studies a delay in sexual maturation was observed; however, there are 
inconsistencies between the 2 studies. In the first study (COY 2/950920) the observed delay in 
sexual maturation was attributed to a growth delay rather than a direct effect on sexual 
maturation. In the second study (00398515) the findings were not secondary to a growth delay 
and were therefore considered test article-related and adverse; however, the observed delay in 
sexual maturation did not result in any effects on reproductive capability in these animals as 
adults. 
Regarding Tanner staging, in CDD patients participating in study 1042 CDD-3001, at screening, 
more than half of all subjects in each treatment group (71.4% in the GNX group, 65.0% in the 
placebo group) were Tanner Stage 1 (1042 CDD-3001 CSR Table 14.3.10). Overall, there were 
no medically important differences in baseline Tanner Stage between the GNX and placebo 
groups. At Week 52, there was an overall small numerical shift from lower Tanner stages to 
higher Tanner stages. This small shift was expected given that the majority subjects were at the 
pre-puberty age (mean and median age of 7.26 and 6.00 years old, respectively [see 1042-CDD-
3001 CSR Table 5]). Furthermore, the same trend appeared in subjects regardless of if they had 
received placebo or GNX in the double-blind period of study 1042-CDD-3001. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
General risk factors for a delay in sexual maturation include: chronic illnesses (sickle cell 
anaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, etc); psychosocial 
conditions (depression, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, excessive exercise), Genetic conditions 
(Kallman syndrome, brain mass or tumour, Klinefelter syndrome, testicular regression syndrome, 
autoimmune ovarian failure, Turner syndrome), radiation therapy, testicular surgery, surgery to 
ovaries (Tang 2022). 
Preventability: 
The SmPC informs of the delay in sexual maturation and growth observed in the non-clinical 
studies. ZTALMY is a prescription only medicine and is prescribed by physicians experienced in 
the treatment of epilepsy. No other specific risk minimisation measures are in place for this 
potential risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The benefit of GNX as adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients 
who are often subject to frequent and debilitating daily seizures may outweigh the concern of 
long-term use of GNX.  However, the long-term risks of ZTALMY have not been established 
currently and additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to further characterise the risks 
(Part III.2). 
Public health impact: 
There is insufficient clinical data to assess the public health impact of this potential risk. 
Important Potential Risk 2: Suicidal behaviour and ideation 
Potential mechanisms: 
AEDs have a class warning about an increased risk of suicidality. Patients with epilepsy are at 
elevated risk for suicide as compared to population controls (Christensen 2007). The mechanism 
of this risk is unknown. The available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk with 
GNX. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In a comprehensive search of the entire GNX clinical development programme including 
completed and ongoing studies, a total of 9 reports of suicidality were identified in >1600 
subjects exposed to GNX. In completed placebo-controlled studies, 1 (0.1%) event of suicidality 
occurred in the GNX group while 3 events (0.3%) occurred in the placebo group. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Specifically, in subjects with epilepsy in completed placebo-controlled studies there were no 
TEAEs of suicidality in the GNX group (N=325) and 1 (0.4%) TEAE (PT Suicidal ideation) in 
the placebo group (N=274) (GNX IB, 03 Jun 2021, Table 59). 
Suicidality has been reported in open-label GNX studies in 3 subjects with epilepsy and in 3 
subjects with postpartum depression. For the 3 subjects with epilepsy, all were also receiving 1 to 
3 AEDs at the time of the event; all 3 subjects with postpartum depression reported active 
suicidal ideations at 1 time point each and the subsequent visit results returned to baseline. No 
suicidality has been reported in GNX studies conducted in healthy subjects. In a Phase 3 trial 
(Study 1042-0603) of GNX in treatment refractory focal onset seizures, shifts to the category of 
any suicidal ideation or behaviour assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) during the study were very infrequent and comparable between GNX and placebo 
groups (GNX IB, 03 Jun 2021).  
There were no events of suicidality reported in subjects in Study 1042-CDD-3001 nor in the All 
GNX CDD Population. Overall clinical trial data to date do not support an increased risk of 
suicidality in subjects treated with GNX. Patients treated with GNX should be monitored for the 
emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviour, and/or any unusual 
changes in mood or behaviour. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO 2021), more than 700,000 people die due to 
suicide every year in the general population, with suicide being the fourth leading cause of death 
in 15 to 19-year-olds. While suicide is relatively rare in children, in Europe, where youth suicide 
rates are tending to decrease, suicide is ranked as the second most frequent cause of death in 
those aged 10-19 years. In general, the presence of a mental disorder substantially increases 
suicide risk but moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses (such 
as education, living situation, or peer pressure) can have a contributory role (Bilson 2018). 
It is unknown if there is a background tendency towards suicidal behaviour and ideation in the 
specific CDD population. 
Preventability: 
In general key prevention strategies can be population based involving mental health promotion, 
education, awareness by campaigns on mental resilience, careful media coverage, and limited 
access to means of committing suicide. In addition, high-risk subgroups can be targeted for 
example by implementing specific school-based programmes, providing crisis hotlines and online 
help, and where possible detecting and coaching dysfunctional families (Bilson 2018). 
The ZTALMY SmPC advises patientâs caregivers to monitor for signs of suicidal behaviour and 
ideation, and self-harm behaviour during treatment with GNX and when changes in the treatment 
regimen become necessary. Caregivers are advised to seek medical advice should any signs of 
suicidal behaviour and ideation, or self-harm behaviour emerge. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Suicidality is an important potential risk although currently the clinical data do not support an 
increased risk of suicidality in subjects treated with GNX. CDD is a serious and potentially life-
threatening condition with limited effective therapeutic options for treatment of the CDD 
associated epileptic seizures.  
The benefit of GNX as adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD outweighs 
the important potential risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation which can be appropriately 
managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional awareness of key aspects of the 
proposed labelling and adherence to the guidance in the ZTALMY SmPC that advises monitoring 
of patients for signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation, or self-harm behaviour. 
The data do not impact the overall positive benefit-risk profile for GNX as adjunctive treatment 
for patients with CDD. 
Public health impact: 
Although AEDs have a class warning about an increased risk of suicidality, clinical data in 
subjects treated with GNX do not currently support a similar increased risk of suicidality and the 
impact on public health is expected to be low. 
 
SVII.3.2. 
Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information 1: Use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding 
Evidence source:  
Use of GNX during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been evaluated in the clinical 
development programme and there are no data available for GNX exposure in pregnant women or 
during breastfeeding. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of GNX 
and its metabolites in milk. A milk excretion study conducted in five healthy adult lactating 
women treated with a 300 mg oral dose of GNX showed GNX concentrations in breast milk to be 
approximately 4-fold higher than in plasma (Module SIV.1). Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at maximum tolerated 
doses that were below clinical exposures (Module SII). In the rat fertility and early embryonic 
development study, alterations in oestrous cyclicity occurred at the high dose level, however, 
there were no effects on spermatogenesis, reproductive performance, fertility, and early 
embryonic development. In the combined embryo-foetal development and pre- and postnatal 
development study in rats, there were no effects of GNX on embryo-foetal growth, survival, or 
morphology at the high dose level. In the postnatal phase of the study, gestation length was 
slightly lengthened and slight delays in offspring growth and related developmental milestones 
occurred at the high dose level of 40 mg/kg/day. There were no effects of GNX on postnatal 
survival, behavioural function, or reproductive capability at the high dose level of 40 mg/kg/day. 
Use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding is an area of missing information. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
Findings from studies in animals may be relevant for humans and in the absence of data in 
humans suggest minimal safety concern with use of GNX during pregnancy. Furthermore, 
ZTALMY is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in 
patients 2 years of age and older. Epileptic seizures are usually the first symptom of CDD 
commencing in 96.9% of patients in the first six months of life and in 90% in the first three 
months of life (Jakimiec 2020; Mangatt 2016), with most individuals who have been identified 
with CDD being under 18 years of age (Module SI).  
Hence, with the majority use of ZTALMY anticipated in children and adolescents, use of 
ZTALMY during pregnancy or breastfeeding is anticipated to be very minimal. ZTALMY is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Furthermore, the SmPC advises healthcare professionals to decide whether a female patient 
should discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue ZTALMY therapy taking into account the 
benefit of ZTALMY therapy for the woman versus the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant.

Study 1042-CDD-3001 (open-label extension) summary 
Study short name and title: 
Study 1042-CDD-3001 
A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial of Adjunctive GNX Treatment in 
Children and Young Adults with CDD Followed by Long-term Open-label Treatment 
Rationale and study objectives: 
This study originally assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GNX compared with 
placebo as adjunctive therapy to the subjectâs standard anti-seizure medication for the treatment 
of seizures in children and young adults with genetically confirmed CDD during a 17-week, 
double-blind phase. An optional long-term open-label extension phase follows the double-blind 
phase at which point all subjects receive GNX as an adjunct to their standard anti-seizure 
medication; efficacy, safety and tolerability, and PK assessments will continue to be performed. 
Study design: 
The study consists of a 6-week prospective baseline period to collect seizure data, followed by a 
17-week double-blind treatment phase, which is then followed by a long-term open-label phase
(approximately 3 yearsâ duration). Subjects will continue receiving GNX in the open-label phase
until GNX is approved or until research on GNX is discontinued.
After completing the initial 17-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, all subjects who 
agreed to continue are receiving GNX in the open-label phase of the study. Ganaxolone subjects 
continued GNX treatment whilst placebo subjects titrated onto GNX. To maintain the blind, 
subjects initially randomised to GNX underwent a false titration (increasing placebo doses) for 
4 weeks, while placebo subjects titrated up to 63 mg/kg/day GNX (1800 mg/day maximum) 
during the same time period. 
Except for the changes in seizure frequency during the titration phase and during the maintenance 
phase, the same efficacy, exploratory, quality of life, and safety endpoints for the double-blind 
phase will also be used for the open-label phase. In addition, Tanner Staging, which is performed 
at Screening in the double-blind phase, will be repeated during the open-label phase and assessed 
as a safety endpoint. 
Participants will be required to complete a daily seizure calendar noting seizure type and 
frequency in an eDiary calendar to determine GNXâs effect on seizures. A variety of clinician and 
caregiver administered instruments will be used to assess the efficacy of GNX in CDKL5, and 
include: Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Attention (CGICA), Caregiver Global 
Impression of Change (CGI-C) in parent/caregiver identified behavioural target-potential 
domains of sociability, communication, irritability, and hyperactivity, Clinical Global Impression 
of Improvement (CGI-I) by parent/caregiver and clinician, Caregiver Global Impression of 
Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration (CGI-CSID), Childrenâs Sleep Habit Questionnaire 
(CSHQ), Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), Quality of Life Inventory-Disability 
(QI-Disability), and Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Safety and tolerability will be assessed by 
monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, weight, and 
height), ECGs, clinical laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), physical, 
neurological, and developmental examinations, and frequency, type, and severity of adverse 
events during the 17-week, double-blind phase, and the open-label phase. 
Study population: 
One hundred and one (101) male or female children and young adults aged 2-21 years with CDD 
were randomly assigned to receive GNX or placebo (1:1 ratio) for 17 weeks in addition to their 
standard anti-seizure treatment in the double-blind phase and are continuing into the long-term 
open-label phase. Molecular confirmation of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant, 
early onset, difficult to control seizures, and neurodevelopmental impairment were required 
criteria for entry into the study. Initial double-blind participants were required to have at least 16 
seizures of primary seizure types: bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity â¥3 seconds), 
generalised tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, atonic/drop or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic per 28 days 
in each 1-month period in the 2-month period prior to screening. These participants were required 
to be on a stable regimen of 0-4 anti-seizure medications (including moderate or strong inducer or 
inhibitor anti-seizure medications e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc.) for â¥1 month prior to the 
screening visit, without a foreseeable change in dosing for the duration of the double-blind phase.

EURAP Observational Study Summary 
Study short name and title: 
EURAP Observational Study 
An International Registry of Antiepileptic Drugs and Pregnancy 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The use of AEDs during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of birth defects. It 
is unclear if some AEDs are safer to use during pregnancy than others. There are limited data on 
use of GNX in pregnant women since pregnant or breastfeeding patients were excluded from the 
clinical development programme. The primary objective of participation in the EURAP 
observational study is to evaluate and determine the comparative degree of safety of GNX in 
pregnant women, with reference to and in combination with other antiepileptic drugs, including 
the evaluation of any specific pattern of major malformations, dose-effect relationships and other 
risk factors.  
Participation in the EURAP observational study will help to provide meaningful conclusions with 
respect to the safety of GNX in pregnancy through an international collaboration generating large 
numbers of female patients of childbearing age. 
Study design: 
This is an observational study and does not interfere with the treatment prescribed by the 
patientâs physician. The aim is to collect information concerning risk factors, exposures during 
pregnancy and pregnancy outcome. The data collected are part of the information that should be 
generally available during good medical care; the study does not entail any special evaluation 
procedure or extra visits. 
All data collection is conducted using a standardised Case Record Form (CRF). Once enrolled 
women are followed up and information on progress of the gestation entered in the CRF at the 
end of each pregnancy trimester. Follow-up should continue until the infant reaches one year of 
age. Five sub-forms (A-E) of the CRF are available for completion at enrolment; after the first, 
second, and third trimesters; within 3 months after delivery; and after proband has completed one 
year of age (no later than 14 months post-delivery).  
Baseline demographic variables, risk factors and relevant clinical variables will be summarised 
descriptively to characterise the study population. For continuous data, statistical description will 
include arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and range, whilst categorical data will be tabulated 
by frequencies and percentages. Multiple logistic regression will be used to evaluate AED effects 
on the incidence of major malformations and intrauterine growth retardation, both as main effects 
and interactions when administered in polytherapy. In particular, multivariable analysis will focus 
on the assessment of the effects of individual AEDs and their combinations in relation to: 1) 
maternal age; 2) familiar history of teratogenic events; 3) exposure to other (non-AED) known 
teratogens; 4) smokerâs status; 5) alcohol consumption; 6) other potential teratogens; 7) AED 
dosage (in absolute terms and in terms of defined daily dosages or their sums); 8) type of epilepsy 
(partial or generalised) and 9) frequency of convulsive seizures during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. All computations will be performed using SAS software procedures. 
Study population: 
All women taking AEDs at the time of conception are eligible for inclusion whether the 
indication for treatment is epilepsy or other disorders. To avoid selection bias, only pregnancies 
enrolled before foetal outcome is known and within week 16 of gestation contribute to the 
prospective study. 
Milestones: 
Update reports will be received half-yearly from the EURAP Central Project Committee, along 
with more detailed but anonymised information on pregnancy outcome after exposure 
specifically to GNX. Data received will be reviewed on an on-going basis as a part of signal 
detection and reported within PSURs, when available. 
CANDID Study Summary 
Study short name and title: 
Study LLF001 (CANDID) 
Endpoint Enabling Study in Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 Deficiency Disorder 
Rationale and study objectives: 
 
The objectives of this global study are to assess the clinical characteristics of CDD across 
multiple domains and to understand the longitudinal trajectories of CDD patients across the 
various clinical outcomes. The study will assess clinical outcomes related to seizures, sleep, 
behaviour, cognition, global development, and quality of life as well as regular safety 
assessments, including adverse events. Adverse events of particular interest are infection-related 
adverse events, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and somnolence. 
As this is an exploratory observational study, no formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned, 
and data will be presented using descriptive statistics.  
Study design: 
This is a longitudinal, observational study which will prospectively follow individuals with 
confirmed CDD over the course of 3 years. It is formally sponsored by the Loulou Foundation 
with support from 7 distinct organisations including Marinus. Medical history and concomitant 
medications will be collected during the baseline visit as well as during follow-up visits over the 
planned 3-year study. Medical history will include developmental history, seizure onset (age), 
seizure classification, clinically significant co-occurring conditions, and prior medical 
interventions. All past and present medications used within 4 weeks prior to baseline will also be 
collected as well as details of psychosocial and non-pharmacological interventions used over the 
past year. Demographic data collected will include age, sex, race/ethnicity, as well as 
participation in early intervention programs. A complete physical exam will be collected by the 
investigator. A paper diary will be provided to the parents/caregivers for their completion daily 
for the first year of the study. For the second- and third-year visits, the diary will be completed 
over a week on a monthly basis. Monitoring and recording of all adverse events and SAE will be 
performed up to the 12-month follow-up visit. After the 12-month visit, only adverse events 
related to study procedures (ie, fatigue) and SAEs will be recorded.  
Enrolment will occur on a rolling basis in up to 40 centres. Planned countries include the US, 
Canada, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Belgium. Study procedures will include in-clinic 
evaluations at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months with remote assessments, using an 
abbreviated schedule of assessments, at 3, 9 and 30 months. 
Study population: 
The study aims to enrol up to 100 patients, males and females, with CDD between the ages of 
newborn and 55 years. Of these patients, it is anticipated that approximately 10 patients recruited 
will have taken GNX at some point given that GNX is now approved in the United States and is 
available in many countries, globally, via a compassionate use mechanism. It is recognised that 
this sample will not provide an adequate basis for confident conclusions regarding the long-term 
safety of GNX. 
Milestones: 
Milestone reports will be provided after at least 10 participants in one age group have completed 
baseline, after at least 50 participants have completed baseline, after 50 participants have 
completed the first-year visit, and once approximately 100 participants have completed the first 
year. Annual study updates will be available to Marinus on or before the 31 January each year. 
Orphan Disease Center CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder International Patient Registry 
Study short name and title: CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder International Patient Registry 
(ODC-IPR-CDD-01, NCT04486768) 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The primary objective of the registry is to collect and enable sharing of real-world demographic, 
clinical, patient reported outcome (PRO), and treatment data collected from patients with CDD or 
their legal guardians, and ultimately, their clinicians. 
Secondarily, the CDKL5 Registry aims to aid in establishing best practices in standard of care for 
CDD, to inform clinical study design by collecting real-world data and providing access to the 
scientific and research community, to enable research through data sharing, to understand patient 
needs and quality of life factors, and to enable rapid recruitment by connecting patients to clinical 
trials. 
Study design: 
This non-interventional, observational, international, prospective, natural history registry will 
follow up to 500 patients diagnosed with CDD over several years through both the 
patients/caregivers and their clinicians. The reporting will be descriptive with no formal 
hypotheses to be tested. Initial data will be collected upon enrolment in the registry, followed by 
the collection of additional CDD-specific data on a bi-annual/ annual basis. No procedures will 
be performed as part of this registry. Clinician-entered data will be collected following standard 
of care visits conducted as part of patients' ongoing clinical care.  
This registry contains several surveys that will be released for patient/caregiver completion at 
enrolment and at time points following enrolment. These surveys can be completed on any 
computer that is connected to the internet. The structure of the CDKL5 Registry allows for the 
addition of new questionnaires to the data collection effort and questions concerning sexual 
maturation and growth are to be included.  
Study population: 
Patients of any age with a diagnosis of CDD confirmed by a clinician or a genetic test.  
Milestones: 
Progress reports every 6 months commencing 2Q 2024. 
GNX Steady-State Metabolite Study 
Study short name and title: 
GNX Steady-State Metabolite Study 
Rationale and study objectives: 
To characterise the GNX metabolite pattern at steady state either through a re-analysis of samples 
retained from the 1042-TQT-1001 study (if feasible) or through the conduct of an additional 
Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (if relevant).  
Study design: 
A re-analysis of retained samples from Study 1042-TQT-1001 will be performed if feasible. 
If the re-analysis is not feasible, a PK study in healthy subjects receiving 600 mg GNX oral 
suspension three-times daily for 3 weeks will be conducted with PK assessments performed 
weekly. The PK profile of GNX, M2, and any other potential metabolites will be characterised.  
Study population: 
Healthy subjects (N=12) (if relevant) 
Milestones: 
Re-analysis of 1042-TQT-1001 study (if feasible) Q3 2023

Metabolite) in Hemizygous CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic Mice  
Rationale and study objectives: 
In addition to the 6-month toxicity study in rats, a 6-month carcinogenicity study in mice is 
planned to further evaluate mortality and morbidity, terminal histopathology, and tumour 
statistics in order to address the safety concern of long-term use. Study results will help support 
the long-term safety of GNX and its metabolites in humans. 
Study design:  
Compliance: GLP 
Pretreatment period: approximately 10 days 
Dosing Regimen:  
â¢  GNX (twice daily [12 hours apart] for 182 days).

â¢  Positive control (three times during Week 1) 
Route of Administration: oral gavage (GNX and M2); positive control dosed via IP injection 
Mortality/Morbidity: Twice daily 
Detailed observations: Weekly and at termination on all main animals 
Cage-side Observations: Daily on all animals 
Body Weight: Day 4, weekly, and at termination on all animals 
Clinical Pathology Parameters: A blood sample will be collected at termination from all animals 
and a blood smear will be prepared. Slide review will only by performed if necessary. 
Toxicokinetic sample collection will be conducted on Days 1 and 180 (relative to the first daily 
dose): 2 timepoints from the control (3/sex) and 6 timepoints from the test groups (3/sex/group) 
for a total of 456 samples. The TK report will include assessment of TK parameters such as Cmax, 
tmax, AUC, dose proportionality for two analytes and single dose route.

M2 Chronic Toxicity Study 
Study short name and title: 
M2 Chronic Toxicity Study 
A 26-Week Oral Gavage Toxicity Study of M2 (Ganaxolone metabolite) in the Albino Rat 
Followed by a 14-Day Recovery 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The M2 metabolite is not formed in any of the non-clinical species used for toxicity testing. In 
rats, M2 was found only at small levels relative to humans after repeated GNX administration. 
Following a recently completed 28-day toxicity study of the M2 metabolite in adult rats 
(Study 1020-7461), a 6-month repeat dose-toxicity study is planned to further evaluate treatment-
related clinical signs, M2 exposure and accumulation, and gender differences in order to address 
the safety concern of long-term use. Study results will help support the long-term safety of GNX 
and its metabolites in humans. 
Study design:  
Compliance: GLP 
Regimen: once daily for 26 weeks followed by a 2-week recovery period. 
Route of administration: oral gavage

Study short name and title: 
M2 Embryo-foetal Development Study 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The embryo-foetal development study is designed to detect potential adverse effects of the M2 
metabolite of GNX on pregnant female rats and the development of embryos and foetuses after 
receiving M2 during organogenesis. The study results will be used to assess any potential risks 
for use of GNX in pregnant women or the developing human embryo and foetus. 
Study design:  
Compliance: GLP

M17 in vitro DDI Studies 
Study short name and title: 
M17 in vitro DDI Studies 
An in vitro assessment of the drug interaction potential of the M17 metabolite as a perpetrator for 
major drug metabolising enzymes and transporters 
Rationale and study objectives:  
The in vitro studies are designed to determine if the M17 sulphated metabolite has the potential to 
cause DDIs. 
Study design: 
Plasma stability study in human and rat plasma. M17 stability will be measured at a single 
concentration (2 Î¼M) in K2EDTA plasma matrix. Stability will be measured at multiple time 
points from 0-4 hrs at 37oC and the percent remaining relative to Time 0 will be reported. 
Time dependent CYP450 inhibition. CYP450 isozymes from human liver microsomes will be 
used. IC50 determinations will be derived from 10 M17 concentrations (0.003 â 100 Î¼M). M17 
will be preincubated for 30 min prior to addition of substrates. The CYP450 substrates to be used 
are as follows: 
â¢  1A2 (phenacetin) 
â¢  2B6 (buproprion) 
â¢  2C8 (amodiaquine) 
â¢  2C9 (diclofenac) 
â¢  2C19 (mephenytoin) 
â¢  2D6 (dextromethorphan) 
â¢  3A4 (midazolam and testosterone) 
There will be a single control inhibitor for each isozyme. Percent inhibition will be calculated 
relative to full activity and no activity control conditions, using peak area ratios. 
Protein Binding, (Equilibrium Dialysis) will be conducted from plasma protein derived from rat 
and human. Protein binding will be assessed in plasma and in brain homogenate. M17 protein 
binding to be conducted at a single concentration (5 Î¼M), at 6 hrs and at 37oC. Warfarin will be 
used as positive control. Percent binding calculated based on analytic area ratios. 
CYP450 Induction 
M17 will first be evaluated for cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes. M17 will be tested in 
concentration response format (0.01 â 100 Î¼M) and IC50 determined. CYP Induction will be 
conducted in human hepatocytes at 3 concentrations of M17 (TBD). Three CYP isozymes will be 
tested: 1A2 (omeprazole control inducer), 2B6 (phenobarbital control inducer), 3A4 (rifampicin 
control inducer). Induction will be measured after 48 hrs of incubation and the per cent induction 
calculated relative to vehicle control. 
CYP450 Reaction Phenotyping for M17 will be conducted in human liver microsomes with 
inhibitors. The metabolic stability of M17 in presence and absence of known inhibitors. Multiple 
time points for half-life calculation will be tested (0-120 min; 37o C). 
The following CYP450 isozymes will be tested: 
â¢ 
 Furafylline (1A2) 
â¢  2-phenyl-2-(1-piperidinyl)propane (2B6) 
â¢  Quercetin (2C8) 
â¢  Sulfaphenazole (2C9) 
â¢  Omeprazole (2C19) 
â¢  Quinidine (2D6) 
â¢  Ketoconazole (3A4) 
Caco-2 Permeability (bi-directional) with Preliminary Transporter Assessment [Pgp (MDR1) 
and BCRP] (SDL-2). These permeability studies will be conducted using human Caco-2 cells and 
measuring bi-directional flux (A-B and B-A). A single M17 concentration will be tested (10 Î¼M) 
at a single time point (2 hrs). Transporter inhibitors for Pgp (MDR1 and BCRP) will also be 
incorporated into the assay.

M17 in vivo PK Study with Brain Penetrance 
Study short name and title: 
M17 in vivo PK Study with Brain Penetrance 
A central nervous system (CNS) distribution study of the major human plasma metabolite, M17 
(sulphate-conjugated metabolite), in rat 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The in vivo studies are designed to determine if M17 is capable of penetrating into the brain and, 
if so, the levels of M17 in the brain. 
Study design: 
M17 will be evaluated for pharmacokinetic characteristics and brain penetrance properties. The in 
vivo PK study will be conducted in adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Eighteen rats will be 
included in the study. There will be 3 rats per time point. Rats will be bled and brains collected 
once at the timepoint described in the table below. Rats will be administered a single dose GNX 
level of M17 (10 mg/kg). The route of administration will be intraperitoneal (IP) to avoid 
intestinal absorption.

Plasma will be prepared for collected blood. Prior to brain dissection, animals will be perfused 
with saline to remove excess blood from collected brain. Brains will be homogenised in 
appropriate homogenisation buffer and M17 extracted. Plasma and brain levels of M17 will be 
measured by standard bioanalytical measures (e.g., LC/MS/MS). PK parameters will be analysed 
using WinNonlin PK non-compartmental analysis.

Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for ZTALMY (Ganaxolone) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ZTALMY. The RMP details 
important risks of ZTALMY, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about ZTALMY's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ZTALMY's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ZTALMY should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for ZTALMY should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ZTALMY's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
ZTALMY is authorised for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with cyclin-
dependent kinase-like 5 deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 to 17 years of age. ZTALMY 
may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older (see SmPC for the full indication). 
It contains ganaxolone as the active substance and it is given as an oral suspension. 
Further information about the evaluation of ZTALMYâs benefits can be found in ZTALMYâs 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicineâs webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ztalmy. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise these risks  
Important risks of ZTALMY, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ZTALMY's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Important advice on the medicineâs packaging 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly 
The medicineâs legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ZTALMY is not yet available, it is listed 
under âmissing informationâ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of ZTALMY are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of ZTALMY. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important potential risk 1:  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Long term safety (including delayed sexual maturation and 
growth) 
Decreased body weight gain and a significant delay in sexual 
maturation was observed in non-clinical studies. However, the 
observed delay in sexual maturation did not result in any effects on 
reproductive capability as adults. The human relevance of this 
finding is unknown as there is insufficient clinical safety data to 
assess long term use effects currently.

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
In a comprehensive search of the entire GNX clinical development 
programme including completed and ongoing studies, a total of 9 
reports of suicidality were identified in >1600 subjects exposed to 
GNX. In completed placebo-controlled studies, 1 (0.1%) event of 
suicidality occurred in the GNX group while 3 events (0.3%) 
occurred in the placebo group. 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO 2021), 
more than 700,000 people die due to suicide every year in the 
general population, with suicide being the fourth leading cause 
of death in 15 to 19-year-olds. While suicide is relatively rare 
in children, in Europe, where youth suicide rates are tending to 
decrease, suicide is ranked as the second most frequent cause 
of death in those aged 10-19 years. In general, the presence of 
a mental disorder substantially increases suicide risk but 
moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with 
life stresses (such as education, living situation, or peer 
pressure) can have a contributory role (Bilson 2018). 
It is unknown if there is a background tendency towards 
suicidal behaviour and ideation in the specific CDD 
population.

placebo as adjunctive therapy to the subjectâs standard anti-seizure medication for the treatment 
of seizures in children and young adults with genetically confirmed CDD during a 17-week, 
double-blind phase. An optional long-term open-label extension phase follows the double-blind 
phase at which point all subjects receive GNX as an adjunct to their standard anti-seizure 
medication; efficacy, safety and tolerability, and PK assessments will continue to be performed. 
EURAP Observational Study 
Purpose of the study: 
The primary objective of participation in the EURAP observational study is to evaluate and 
determine the comparative degree of safety of GNX in pregnant women, with reference to and in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs, including the evaluation of any specific pattern of 
major malformations, dose-effect relationships and other risk factors. Participation in the EURAP 
observational study will help to provide meaningful conclusions with respect to the safety of 
GNX in pregnancy through an international collaboration generating large numbers of female 
patients of childbearing age. 
Study LLF001 (CANDID) 
Purpose of the study: 
The objectives of this global study are to assess the clinical characteristics of CDD across 
multiple domains and to understand the longitudinal trajectories of CDD patients across the 
various clinical outcomes. The study will assess clinical outcomes related to seizures, sleep, 
behaviour, cognition, global development, and quality of life as well as regular safety 
assessments, including adverse events. Adverse events of particular interest are infection-related 
adverse events, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and somnolence. 
As this is an exploratory observational study, no formal statistical hypothesis testing is planned, 
and data will be presented using descriptive statistics. 
 
 
 
 
CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder International Patient Registry 
Purpose of the study: 
The primary objective of the patient registry is to collect and enable sharing of real-world 
demographic, clinical, patient reported outcome (PRO), and treatment data collected from 
patients with CDD or their legal guardians, and ultimately, their clinicians.  Secondarily, the 
CDKL5 Registry aims to aid in establishing best practices in standard of care for CDD, to inform 
clinical study design by collecting real-world data and providing access to the scientific and 
research community, to enable research through data sharing, to understand patient needs and 
quality of life factors, and to enable rapid recruitment by connecting patients to clinical trials. 
GNX Steady-State Metabolite Study 
Purpose of the study: 
To determine the amount of various GNX metabolites in the blood following administration of 
repeated doses of GNX to humans. The study results will be used to assess the long term safety of 
GNX. 
GNX and M2 Transgenic Mouse Carcinogenicity Study 
Purpose of the study: 
This 6-month carcinogenicity study in mice is planned to further evaluate mortality and 
morbidity, terminal histopathology, and tumour statistics to address the safety concern of 
long-term use. Study results will help support the long-term safety of GNX and its metabolites in 
humans. 
M2 Chronic Toxicity Study 
Purpose of the study: 
This 6-month repeat dose-toxicity study is planned to further evaluate treatment-related clinical 
signs, M2 exposure and accumulation, and gender differences in order to address the safety 
concern of long-term use. Study results will help support the long-term safety of GNX and its 
metabolites in humans. 
M2 Embryo-foetal Development Study 
Purpose of the study: 
The embryo-foetal development study is designed to detect potential adverse effects of the M2 
metabolite of GNX on pregnant female rats and the development of embryos and foetuses after 
receiving M2 during the period when organs are formed. The study results will be used to assess 
any potential risks for use of GNX in pregnant women or the developing human embryo and 
foetus. 
Weight of Evidence (WoE) Assessments 
Following completion of the M2 chronic toxicity study, WoE assessments will be made to 
determine whether any further carcinogenicity or juvenile studies are necessary to evaluate long-
term safety.M17 in vitro DDI Studies 
To determine if the M17 sulphated metabolite of GNX has the potential to cause drug-drug 
interactions that may impact the long- term safety. 
M17 in vivo PK Study with Brain Penetrance 
To determine if M17 sulphated metabolite of GNX is capable of penetrating into the brain and, if 
so, the levels of M17 in the brain.

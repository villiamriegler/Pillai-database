SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR WAYLIVRA 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for WAYLIVRA. The RMP details 
important risks of WAYLIVRA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about WAYLIVRA's risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
WAYLIVRA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how WAYLIVRA should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for WAYLIVRA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
WAYLIVRA's RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
WAYLIVRA is authorised for use as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adult patients with 
genetically confirmed FCS (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains volanesorsen as the 
active substance and it is given as 300 mg in 1.5 mL injected subcutaneously once weekly using 
a single-use prefilled syringe. 
Further information about the evaluation of WAYLIVRA’s benefits can be found in 
WAYLIVRA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/waylivra).  
II.  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of WAYLIVRA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about WAYLIVRA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of WAYLIVRA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of WAYLIVRA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of WAYLIVRA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of WAYLIVRA. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
Educational materials will be available for potential prescribers, patients 
and carers and will include information on participation in the 
 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
WAYLIVRA™ Product Registry. The distribution of educational 
materials will be linked to product distribution from a centralized 
warehouse for all of Europe and this will enable the Company to have 
visibility to ordering pharmacies. The product will be shipped along with 
the Prescriber Kit containing educational materials for the treating 
physician, dispensing pharmacist and the patient/carer, and with each 
shipment.  
Enhanced Pharmacovigilance 
The following thrombocytopenia-associated events are considered adverse 
events of special interest (AESI): 
•  Platelet count reduction to < 50 × 109/L with or without bleeding 
events. 
•  Serious bleeding events associated with death, life-threatening nature, 
or hospitalisation. 
Enhanced pharmacovigilance practices will be implemented during the 
collection, collation, assessment and reporting of thrombocytopenia 
associated events. All thrombocytopenia-associated events will be actively 
followed up to achieve a complete dataset for each case. 
A targeted questionnaire for post-marketing AE reports (spontaneous and 
organised data collection sources) will be implemented to solicit case 
details for all reports of thrombocytopenia or platelet count declines. 
ICSRs of thrombocytopenia AESIs will be expedited to the regulatory 
authorities within 15 calendar days. Thrombocytopenia-associated events 
will be reviewed on a monthly basis individually and cumulatively and 
aggregate safety data will be comprehensively analysed and discussed in 
PBRERs on an ongoing basis.

II.C  Post-authorisation Development Plan 
II.C.1 
Studies which are Conditions of the Marketing Authorisation 
The following study is a condition of the marketing authorisation:  
WAYLIVRA™ Product Registry 
Purpose of study: The WAYLIVRA™ Product Registry will enroll patients with FCS prescribed 
WAYLIVRA. Data on platelet monitoring and dose adjustments and incidence of 
 
 
 
 
 
thrombocytopenia and bleeding events will be collected for each patient, and periodic safety 
evaluations will be provided to the EMA in interim annual registry reports and the PBRER. 
This registry will enroll patients treated with WAYLIVRA and will monitor the incidence and 
risk of thrombocytopenia (and any bleeding outcomes associated with thrombocytopenia), as 
well as adherence with platelet monitoring and dose adjustment requirements in the SmPC. The 
registry will also monitor hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, severe injection site reactions, 
immunogenicity/immunological events, safety in elderly patients, safety in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment, outcomes in WAYLIVRA-exposed pregnancies, and the long-term safety 
profile of WAYLIVRA. Efficacy outcomes in terms of triglyceride reduction and clinical 
outcomes of pancreatitis events will also be monitored. All enrolled patients will be 
prospectively followed to collect data while they are on treatment with WAYLIVRA and for 
twelve months following treatment termination.  The registry will exist for the commercial life of 
the drug. The registry will also aim to collect targeted retrospective FCS disease data from the 
patient’s medical history prior to registry enrollment. 
Information on the registry will be included in educational materials for prescribers and patients. 
These will be available to all prescribers and will also be available to pharmacists and clinic staff 
(e.g., nurses, counsellors) and will provide information on the objectives of the registry, the 
importance of the registry, which is being conducted at the request of the CHMP as a Condition 
of the Marketing Authorisation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Benepali in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.  
Benepali can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Benepali is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in 
adults not previously treated with methotrexate. 
Benepali, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression 
of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have 
proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral 
joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or 
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who 
are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Benepali treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque 
psoriasis. Patients treated with Benepali should be given the Patient Card. 
Benepali is available in strengths of 25 and 50 mg. 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg 
administered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). 
Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The recommended dose is 25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once 
weekly. 
For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved 
within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not 
responding within this time period. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The recommended dose of etanercept is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once 
weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or a dose of 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with Benepali 
should continue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks 
may be appropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in 
patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with Benepali is indicated, the same 
guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg 
once weekly. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of 
age. 
Paediatric population 
Benepali is only available as 25 mg pre-filled syringe, 50 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg pre-filled 
pen. 
Thus, it is not possible to administer Benepali to paediatric patients that require less than a full 25 mg 
or 50 mg dose. Paediatric patients who require a dose other than a full 25 mg or 50 mg should not 
receive Benepali. If an alternate dose is required, other etanercept products offering such an option 
should be used.  
The dosage of etanercept is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than 
62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for 
injection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for 
specific indications). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled 
syringe or pre-filled pen.  
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in children aged less than 2 years has not been established. 
No data are available 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a 
subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 
50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients 
who show no response after 4 months. 
A 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the 
weight of 25 kg. 
No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety 
data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar 
to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg 
subcutaneously (see section 5.1). 
There is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 2 years in the indication 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) 
The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 
24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If re-treatment with Benepali is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be 
followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. 
There is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 6 years in the indication 
plaque psoriasis. 
Method of administration 
Benepali is for subcutaneous use (see section 6.6). 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, “Instructions 
for use”. 
Detailed instructions on unintentional dosing or scheduling variations, including missed doses, are 
provided in section 3 of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Sepsis or risk of sepsis. 
Treatment with Benepali should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or 
localised infections. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the brand name and batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with Benepali, taking 
into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 
7 to 300 hours). 
Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal 
infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of etanercept (see section 4.8). 
These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). 
In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting 
in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the 
patient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be 
considered. 
Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Benepali should be monitored 
closely. Administration of Benepali should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. 
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Benepali in patients with a history of 
recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to 
infections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. 
Tuberculosis 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary 
location, have been reported in patients treated with etanercept.  
Before starting treatment with Benepali, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive 
(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history 
of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current 
immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, 
should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the 
conduct of these tests should be recorded in the Patient Card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of 
false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or 
immunocompromised. 
If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Benepali therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) 
tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis 
therapy before the initiation of Benepali, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this 
situation, the benefit/risk balance of Benepali therapy should be very carefully considered. 
All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis 
(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Benepali 
treatment. 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including etanercept, has been reported. This includes 
reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. 
Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Benepali. For patients who 
test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of 
hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering Benepali in patients 
previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active 
HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate 
data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-
antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, Benepali should be 
stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. 
Worsening of hepatitis C 
There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving etanercept. Benepali should 
be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
Concurrent administration of etanercept and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of 
serious infections and neutropenia compared to etanercept alone. This combination has not 
demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of Benepali and anakinra is not 
recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Concurrent treatment with abatacept 
In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased 
incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical 
benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Allergic reactions 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions associated with etanercept administration have been reported commonly. Allergic 
reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious 
allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, Benepali therapy should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate therapy initiated. 
Immunosuppression 
The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including etanercept, to affect host defences against 
infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune 
responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept, there was 
no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or 
change in enumeration of effector cell populations. 
Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of 
aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella 
virus should temporarily discontinue Benepali therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment 
with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers)  
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been 
received in the post-marketing period (see section 4.8). 
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been 
observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the 
occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients 
receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been 
reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for 
lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, 
inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. 
Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other 
haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. 
Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of 
malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. 
Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 
22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including 
etanercept, in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other 
cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically 
associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and 
adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. 
Skin cancers 
Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-
antagonists, including etanercept. Post-marketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported 
very infrequently in patients treated with etanercept. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all 
patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. 
Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients 
receiving etanercept compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.

Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Benepali. No data are available on the secondary 
transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving etanercept. In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also 
received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic 
arthritis patients receiving etanercept were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients 
had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving etanercept. The clinical significance of 
this is unknown. 
Autoantibody formation 
Treatment with Benepali may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). 
Haematologic reactions 
Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have 
been reported in patients treated with etanercept. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated 
with Benepali who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers 
should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or 
infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding and paleness) whilst on Benepali, they 
should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full 
blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, Benepali should be discontinued. 
Neurological disorders 
There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with etanercept (see 
section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies 
(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 
demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have 
been performed evaluating etanercept therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other 
TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful 
risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing Benepali 
to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered 
to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. 
Combination therapy 
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of 
etanercept and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of 
etanercept when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies 
of etanercept and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are 
ongoing. The long-term safety of etanercept in combination with other disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. 
The use of etanercept in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment 
of psoriasis has not been studied. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. 
Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physicians should use caution when using Benepali in patients who have congestive heart failure 
(CHF). There have been post-marketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable 
precipitating factors, in patients taking etanercept. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new 
onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of 
these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of 
etanercept in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not 
conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those 
patients assigned to etanercept treatment. 
Alcoholic hepatitis 
In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with etanercept or 
placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, etanercept was not efficacious, and the mortality 
rate in patients treated with etanercept was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, Benepali 
should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution 
when using Benepali in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. 
Wegener's granulomatosis 
A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with etanercept in addition to 
standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median 
duration of 25 months, has not shown etanercept to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s 
granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly 
higher in patients treated with etanercept than in the control group. Benepali is not recommended for 
the treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes 
There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of etanercept in patients receiving 
medicinal products for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medicinal products in some 
of these patients. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall 
differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older 
who received etanercept were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be 
exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of 
infections.  
Paediatric population 
Vaccinations 
It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating etanercept therapy (see 
Vaccinations, above). 
Benepali contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
Adult patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious 
infection when compared with patients treated with either etanercept or anakinra alone (historical 
data). 
In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background 
methotrexate, patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of 
serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). The combination etanercept and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is 
therefore not recommended. 
Concurrent treatment with abatacept 
In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased 
incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical 
benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine 
In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which 
etanercept was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant 
decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with etanercept or 
sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use 
caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. 
Non-interactions 
In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when etanercept was administered with 
glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
analgesics, or methotrexate (see section 4.4 for vaccination advice). 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, 
digoxin or warfarin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Pregnancy 
Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the 
foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been 
investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in 
an observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester, 
with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 
95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most commonly reported 
in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the 
rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational 
multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to 
etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic medicinal 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products (n=3,497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio 
[OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, 
maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no 
increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for 
infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. Benepali should only be used during 
pregnancy if clearly needed. 
Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients 
treated with etanercept during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants 
may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the 
mother’s last dose of Benepali is generally not recommended. 
Breast-feeding 
In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and 
detected in the serum of pups. Limited information from the published literature indicates etanercept 
has been detected at low levels in human milk. Etanercept could be considered for use during 
breast-feeding taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
While systemic exposure in a breastfed infant is expected to be low because etanercept is largely 
degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, limited data regarding systemic exposure in the breastfed infant 
are available. Therefore, the administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG) to a breastfed infant when the 
mother is receiving etanercept could be considered 16 weeks after stopping breast-feeding (or at an 
earlier timepoint if the infant etanercept serum levels are undetectable). 
Fertility 
Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility 
and general reproductive performance are not available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Etanercept has no or neglegible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, 
itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, 
bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), headache, allergic reactions, development of 
autoantibodies, itching, and fever. 
Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for etanercept. TNF-antagonists, such as etanercept, 
affect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. 
Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with etanercept. Reports have included 
fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use 
of etanercept, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). 
Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These 
include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral 
demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with etanercept use. There 
have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 
rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with etanercept for up to approximately 6 years, 
including 231 patients treated with etanercept in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-
controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those 
expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of 
approximately 2 years duration involving 240 etanercept-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical 
studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were 
reported in etanercept-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with 
etanercept in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 
nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. 
In a group of 7,416 patients treated with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. 
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been 
received in the post-marketing period (see section 4.4). 
Injection site reactions 
Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with etanercept had a significantly 
higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in 
the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the 
majority of injection site reactions in the etanercept treatment groups, and the majority of patients who 
were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. 
Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at 
the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at 
previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. 
In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with 
etanercept developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during 
the first 12 weeks of treatment. 
Serious infections 
In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or 
requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% 
of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with etanercept for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at 
various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, 
endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, 
osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin 
infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-
controlled study where patients were treated with either etanercept alone, methotrexate alone or 
etanercept in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the 
treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of etanercept with 
methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. 
There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with etanercept and those treated 
with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious 
infections experienced by etanercept-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, 
cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, 
diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported 
a serious infection (pneumonia). 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of etanercept; reported pathogens include 
bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few 
weeks after initiating treatment with etanercept in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., 
diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their 
rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). Benepali treatment may increase mortality in patients with 
established sepsis.  
Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with etanercept, including invasive fungal, 
parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and 
Legionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall 
incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received etanercept. The 
exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In post-marketing experience, 
approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive 
fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, 
Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half 
of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports 
with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal 
infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). 
Autoantibodies 
Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid 
arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed 
new positive ANA (≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with etanercept (11%) than in placebo-
treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded 
DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with etanercept 
compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated 
with etanercept compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with 
etanercept who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-
treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with etanercept on the development of 
autoimmune diseases is unknown. 
There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have 
developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are 
compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy.  
Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia 
There have been post-marketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had 
fatal outcomes (see section 4.4). 
Interstitial lung disease 
In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of 
interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% 
(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept 
and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% 
(frequency uncommon). There have been post-marketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including 
pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with etanercept plus anakinra, a higher 
rate of serious infections compared to etanercept alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) 
developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient 
developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elevated liver enzymes 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the 
frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving 
etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind 
periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and 
methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 
4.18% (frequency common). 
Autoimmune hepatitis 
In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of 
autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% 
(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept 
and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% 
(frequency uncommon).  
Paediatric population 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in 
frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special 
considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years 
were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric 
populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic 
meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, 
depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic 
shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. 
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children 
experienced an infection while receiving etanercept during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), 
and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-
label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
patients were similar to those seen in trials of etanercept in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of etanercept compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid 
arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 
1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 
0.74 events per patient year). 
There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse 
events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The 
highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient 
mistakenly self-administered 62 mg etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without 
experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to etanercept. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, 
ATC code: L04AB01 
Benepali is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with 
psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque 
psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in 
psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of 
TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and 
lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-
kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist 
naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF 
biological activity. 
TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on 
cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher 
affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of 
TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion 
element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. 
Mechanism of action 
Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in 
plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by 
TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF 
binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF 
biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional 
downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or 
regulated by TNF. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, 
two studies in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study 
in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, 
three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. 
Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The 
study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least 
one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 
25 mg etanercept or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid 
arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. 
ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with etanercept at 3 and 6 months than in 
patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: etanercept 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 
6 months, respectively: ACR 50: etanercept 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, 
respectively; p < 0.01 etanercept vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 
responses).  
Approximately 15% of subjects who received etanercept achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and 
month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving 
etanercept, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and 
nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate 
between placebo and 25 mg. Etanercept was significantly better than placebo in all components of the 
ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the 
ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which 
included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status 
subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were 
improved in patients treated with etanercept compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. 
After discontinuation of etanercept, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. 
Reintroduction of treatment with etanercept after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the 
same magnitudes of responses as patients who received etanercept without interruption of therapy 
based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years 
in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received etanercept without interruption. 
The efficacy of etanercept was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study 
with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active 
rheumatoid arthritis (< 3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses 
of 10 mg or 25 mg etanercept were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 
24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over 
the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset 
of action within 2 weeks with etanercept 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was 
maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean 
HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with etanercept 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 
12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was 
maintained in Year 2 of this study. 
In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total 
Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. 
Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg 
etanercept dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. Etanercept 
25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The 
differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and etanercept 
25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below.

In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and 
radiographic progression in RA patients treated with etanercept alone (25 mg twice weekly), 
methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of etanercept and 
methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to 
at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. 
Patients in the etanercept in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher 
ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 
52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). 
Significant advantages for etanercept in combination with methotrexate compared with etanercept 
monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

Significant advantages for etanercept in combination with methotrexate compared with etanercept 
monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the 
significant advantages for etanercept monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were 
also observed after 24 months. 
In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to 
have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was 
higher in the etanercept in combination with methotrexate group compared with the etanercept alone 
and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05). The difference between 
etanercept alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p < 0.05). Among patients who 
completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 
61%, respectively. 
The safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly 
were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this 
study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg etanercept once weekly and 
153 patients received 25 mg etanercept twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two 
etanercept treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of 
RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. 
Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active 
psoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) 
distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules 
and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-
like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter.

Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids 
(24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable 
dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-finding studies in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the 
end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total 
duration of up to 2 years. 
Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 
response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC). Results 
are summarised in the table below.

Among patients with psoriatic arthritis who received etanercept, the clinical responses were apparent 
at the time of the first visit (4 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. Etanercept 
was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p < 0.001), and responses 
were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis 
patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index 
score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with etanercept, 
relative to placebo (p < 0.001). 
Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists 
were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in 
the table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were 
considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 
12 months was higher in the etanercept group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, 
respectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of etanercept on radiographic progression was maintained in 
patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage 
was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement.

There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of etanercept in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like 
and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied. 
No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once-weekly dosing 
regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been 
based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. 
Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
The efficacy of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind 
studies comparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg etanercept with placebo. A total of 401 
patients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with etanercept. The largest of these trials 
(n = 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing 
spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity 
of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient 
global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 
questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving 
DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete 
ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-
finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously 
twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. 
The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 
Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, 
BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 
70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. 
Compared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, 
ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received etanercept, the clinical responses were 
apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. 
Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline.  
Similar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials.

In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered 
once weekly vs. 25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy 
profiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. 
Adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Study 1 
The efficacy of etanercept in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was 
assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 
215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), 
defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not 
meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate 
response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received 
etanercept 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 
40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the 
remaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all 
patients receive etanercept 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint 
and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. 
Compared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in statistically significant improvement in the 
ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial 
remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below.

At week 12, there was a statistically significant improvement in the SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis 
Research Consortium of Canada) score for the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as measured by MRI for patients 
receiving etanercept. Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for etanercept treated (n = 95) 
versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n = 105) patients (p < 0.001). At week 104, the mean change from 
baseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all etanercept-treated subjects was 4.64 for the 
SIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). 
Etanercept showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared 
to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI 
(Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 
Physical Component Score. 
Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received etanercept were apparent at the time of the 
first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related 
quality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data 
did not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral

Study 2 
This multi-center, open-label, phase 4, 3-period study evaluated the withdrawal and retreatment of 
etanercept in patients with active nr-AxSpa who achieved an adequate response (inactive disease 
defined as Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) C-reactive protein (CRP) less 
than 1.3) following 24 weeks of treatment.  
209 adult patients with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the 
Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria of axial 
spondyloarthritis (but not meeting the modified New York criteria for AS), having positive MRI 
findings (active inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated with SpA) and/or 
positive hsCRP (defined as high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > 3 mg/l), and active 
symptoms defined by an ASDAS CRP greater than or equal to 2.1 at the screening visit received open 
label etanercept 50 mg weekly plus stable background NSAID at the optimal tolerated anti-
inflammatory dosage for 24 weeks in Period 1. Patients were also required to have an inadequate 
response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. At week 24, 119 (57%) patients achieved inactive 
disease and entered into the Period 2 40-week withdrawal phase where subjects discontinued 
etanercept, yet maintained the background NSAID. The primary measure of efficacy was the 
occurrence of flare (defined as an ASDAS erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than or equal 
to 2.1) within 40 weeks following withdrawal of etanercept. Patients who flared were retreated with 
etanercept 50 mg weekly for 12 weeks (Period 3). 
In Period 2, the proportion of patients experiencing ≥1 flare increased from 22% (25/112) at week 4 to 
67% (77/115) at week 40. Overall, 75% (86/115) patients experienced a flare at any time point within 
40 weeks following withdrawal of etanercept.  
The key secondary objective of Study 2 was to estimate time to flare after withdrawal of etanercept 
and additionally compare the time to flare to patients from Study 1 who met the Study 2 withdrawal 
phase entry requirements and continued etanercept therapy.   
The median time to flare following withdrawal of etanercept was 16 weeks (95% CI: 13-24 weeks). 
Less than 25% of patients in Study 1 who did not have treatment withdrawn experienced a flare over 
the equivalent 40-weeks as in Period 2 Study 2. The time to flare was statistically significantly shorter 
in subjects who discontinued etanercept treatment (Study 2) compared to subjects who received 
continuous etanercept treatment (Study 1), p<0.0001. 
Of the 87 patients who entered Period 3 and were retreated with etanercept 50 mg weekly for 12 
weeks, 62% (54/87) reachieved inactive disease, with 50% of them reachieving it within 5 weeks 
(95% CI: 4 8 weeks). 
Adult patients with plaque psoriasis 
Etanercept is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who “failed to 
respond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than 
good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a 
sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least one of the three major systemic therapies as 
available.   
The efficacy of etanercept versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis 
(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing 
etanercept with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed 
in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four 
studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least 
a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks.

Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving 
≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were 
randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of etanercept (n = 57) or placebo (n = 55) twice a week for 24 
weeks. 
Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 
1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. 
Etanercept was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a 
week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, 
patients received placebo or one of the above three etanercept doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, 
patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded etanercept (25 mg twice a week); patients 
in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally 
randomised. 
Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study 
received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg etanercept, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all 
patients received open-label 25 mg etanercept twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. 
Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this 
study received a dose of 50 mg etanercept or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients 
received open-label 50 mg etanercept once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. 
In study 1, the etanercept-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 
75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p < 0.0001). At 24 weeks, 
56% of patients in the etanercept-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-
treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received etanercept, significant responses relative to

Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement 
of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the 
occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at 
least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, 
symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No 
rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was 
some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with etanercept in patients initially responding to 
treatment. 
In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and 
had their etanercept dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 
response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the 
PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. 
In study 4, the etanercept-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 
(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once 
weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving 
PASI 75 at week 24. 
In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where etanercept was given without interruption, 
clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. 
An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist 
clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, 
the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and 
individual patient needs. 
Antibodies to etanercept 
Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These 
antibodies have generally been non-neutralising and transient. There appears to be no correlation 
between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with 
polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset 
types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to 
severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, 
methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients 
received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, 
patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on etanercept or receive placebo 
for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, 
defined as 30% improvement in at least three of six and 30% worsening in no more than one of six 
JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent 
global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare 
was defined as a 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and 30% improvement in not 
more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. 
In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In 
part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on etanercept experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 
26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p = 0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was 
116 days for patients who received etanercept and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of 
patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients remaining on etanercept continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those 
who received placebo did not improve. 
In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 
4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive etanercept for up to 10 years. Rates of serious 
adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. 
Long-term safety of etanercept monotherapy (n = 103), etanercept plus methotrexate (n = 294), or 
methotrexate monotherapy (n = 197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 
2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, 
infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate 
alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. 
In another open-label single-arm study (n=127), 60 patients with extended oligoarthrits (EO) (15 
patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with 
enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years 
old) were treated with etanercept at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) 
administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 
30 criteria and demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender 
joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other 
JIA studies. 
Of the 127 patients in the parent study, 109 participated in the open-label extension study and were 
followed for an additional 8 years for a total of up to 10 years. At the end of the extension study, 
84/109 (77%) patients had completed the study; 27 (25%) while actively taking etanercept, 7 (6%) had 
withdrawn from treatment due to low/inactive disease; 5 (5%) had re-started etanercept following an 
earlier withdrawal from treatment; and 45 (41%) had stopped etanercept (but remained under 
observation); 25/109 (23%) patients permanently discontinued from the study. Improvements in 
clinical status achieved in the parent study were generally maintained for all efficacy endpoints during 
the entire follow-up period. Patients actively taking etanercept could enter an optional withdrawal-
retreatment period once during the extension study based on investigator’s judgement of clinical 
response. 30 patients entered the withdrawal period. 17 patients were reported to have a flare (defined 
as ≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 ACR Pedi components with ≥ 30% improvement in not more 
than 1 of the remaining 6 components and a minimum of 2 active joints); median time to flare after 
etanercept withdrawal was 190 days. 13 patients were re-treated and the median time to re-treatment 
from withdrawal was estimated as 274 days. Due to the small number of data points, these results 
should be interpreted with caution. 
The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the parent study. 
Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of 
continued etanercept therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating etanercept 
therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of reducing the 
recommended dose of etanercept following its long-term use in patients with JIA. 
Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an 
sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of 
receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. 
Patients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At 
week 12, more patients randomised to etanercept had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than 
those randomised to placebo.

After the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 
50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were 
similar to those observed in the double-blind period. 
During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo 
experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to 
etanercept. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. 
The long-term safety and effectiveness of etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was 
assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 
2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with etanercept was 
generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) 
method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. 
Absorption 
Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum 
concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With 
twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high 
as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg etanercept, the average 
maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area 
under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg × hr/ml. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in 
treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC 
of 297 mg × hr/l vs. 316 mg × hr/l for 50 mg etanercept once weekly (n = 21) vs. 25 mg etanercept 
twice weekly (n = 16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in 
healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be 
bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. 
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady 
state AUCs were 466 μg × hr/ml and 474 μg × hr/ml for 50 mg etanercept once weekly (n = 154) and 
25 mg twice weekly (n = 148), respectively. 
Distribution 
A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central 
volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 L, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 L. 
Elimination 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is 
approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 
0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of etanercept in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. 
There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. 
Linearity 
Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance 
across the dosing range. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept 
to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with 
acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. 
Hepatic impairment 
Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The 
presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. 
Elderly 
The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept 
serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to 
estimates in patients less than 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with etanercept, 69 patients (aged 4 to 
17 years) were administered 0.4 mg etanercept/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration 
profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children 
(4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared 
with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older 
children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children 
will have appreciably lower levels. 
Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum 
steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean 
concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed 
in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to 
maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult 
patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the toxicological studies with etanercept, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. 
Etanercept was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not 
performed with etanercept due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Etanercept did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single 
subcutaneous dose of 2,000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1,000 mg/kg. Etanercept did not 
elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly 
subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-
based serum concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the 
recommended dose of 25 mg.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Benepali in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.  
Benepali can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Benepali is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in 
adults not previously treated with methotrexate. 
Benepali, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression 
of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have 
proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral 
joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or 
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who 
are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Benepali treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque 
psoriasis. Patients treated with Benepali should be given the Patient Card. 
Benepali is available in strengths of 25 and 50 mg. 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The recommended dose is 50 mg etanercept administered once weekly (see section 5.1). 
Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The recommended dose is 50 mg etanercept administered once weekly. 
For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved 
within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responding within this time period. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The recommended dose of etanercept is 50 mg administered once weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given 
twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 50 mg once weekly. 
Treatment with Benepali should continue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous 
therapy beyond 24 weeks may be appropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment 
should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with Benepali 
is indicated, the same guidance on treatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 50 mg 
once weekly. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18-64 years of 
age. 
Paediatric population 
Benepali is only available as 25 mg pre-filled syringe, 50 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg pre-filled 
pen. 
Thus, it is not possible to administer Benepali to paediatric patients that require less than a full 25 mg 
or 50 mg dose. Paediatric patients who require a dose other than a full 25 mg or 50 mg should not 
receive Benepali. If an alternate dose is required, other etanercept products offering such an option 
should be used. 
The dosage of etanercept is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than 
62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for 
injection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for 
specific indications). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more, may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled 
syringe or pre-filled pen.  
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in children aged less than 2 years has not been established. 
No data are available. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a 
subcutaneous injection with an interval of 3-4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 
50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients 
who show no response after 4 months. 
A 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the 
weight of 25 kg. 
No formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety 
data from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar 
to that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg 
subcutaneously (see section 5.1). 
There is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 2 years in the indication 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to 
24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. 
If re-treatment with Benepali is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be 
followed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. 
There is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 6 years in the indication 
plaque psoriasis. 
Method of administration 
Benepali is for subcutaneous use (see section 6.6). 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, “Instructions 
for use”. 
Detailed instructions on unintentional dosing or scheduling variations, including missed doses, are 
provided in section 3 of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Sepsis or risk of sepsis. 
Treatment with Benepali should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or 
localised infections. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the brand name and batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Patients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with Benepali, taking 
into consideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 
7 to 300 hours). 
Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal 
infections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of etanercept (see section 4.8). 
These infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). 
In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting 
in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the 
patient’s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be 
considered. 
Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Benepali should be monitored 
closely. Administration of Benepali should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. 
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Benepali in patients with a history of 
recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to 
infections, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tuberculosis 
Cases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary 
location, have been reported in patients treated with etanercept.  
Before starting treatment with Benepali, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive 
(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history 
of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current 
immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, 
should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the 
conduct of these tests should be recorded in the Patient Card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of 
false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or 
immunocompromised. 
If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Benepali therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) 
tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis 
therapy before the initiation of Benepali, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this 
situation, the benefit/risk balance of Benepali therapy should be very carefully considered. 
All patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis 
(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Benepali 
treatment. 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
and had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including etanercept, has been reported. This includes 
reports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. 
Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Benepali. For patients who 
test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of 
hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering Benepali in patients 
previously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active 
HBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate 
data from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-
antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, Benepali should be 
stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. 
Worsening of hepatitis C 
There have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving etanercept. Benepali should 
be used with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
Concurrent administration of etanercept and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of 
serious infections and neutropenia compared to etanercept alone. This combination has not 
demonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of Benepali and anakinra is not 
recommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Concurrent treatment with abatacept 
In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased 
incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical 
benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions associated with etanercept administration have been reported commonly. Allergic 
reactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious 
allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, Benepali therapy should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate therapy initiated. 
Immunosuppression 
The possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including etanercept, to affect host defences against 
infections and malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune 
responses. In a study of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept, there was 
no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or 
change in enumeration of effector cell populations. 
Two juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of 
aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella 
virus should temporarily discontinue Benepali therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment 
with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated. 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
Solid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers)  
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been 
received in the post-marketing period (see section 4.8). 
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been 
observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the 
occurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients 
receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been 
reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for 
lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, 
inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. 
Based on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other 
haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. 
Caution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of 
malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. 
Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 
22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including 
etanercept, in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other 
cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically 
associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and 
adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. 
Skin cancers 
Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-
antagonists, including etanercept. Post-marketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported 
very infrequently in patients treated with etanercept. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all 
patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients 
receiving etanercept compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. 
Vaccinations 
Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Benepali. No data are available on the secondary 
transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving etanercept. In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also 
received a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic 
arthritis patients receiving etanercept were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients 
had two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving etanercept. The clinical significance of 
this is unknown. 
Autoantibody formation 
Treatment with Benepali may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). 
Haematologic reactions 
Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have 
been reported in patients treated with etanercept. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated 
with Benepali who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers 
should be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or 
infections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, and paleness) whilst on Benepali, they 
should seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full 
blood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, Benepali should be discontinued. 
Neurological disorders 
There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with etanercept (see 
section 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies 
(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 
demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have 
been performed evaluating etanercept therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other 
TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful 
risk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing Benepali 
to patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered 
to have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. 
Combination therapy 
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of 
etanercept and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of 
etanercept when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies 
of etanercept and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are 
ongoing. The long-term safety of etanercept in combination with other disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) has not been established. 
The use of etanercept in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment 
of psoriasis has not been studied. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. 
Congestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) 
Physicians should use caution when using Benepali in patients who have congestive heart failure 
(CHF). There have been post-marketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable 
precipitating factors, in patients taking etanercept. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new 
onset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of 
these patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of 
etanercept in the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not 
conclusive, data from one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those 
patients assigned to etanercept treatment. 
Alcoholic hepatitis 
In a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with etanercept or 
placebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, etanercept was not efficacious, and the mortality 
rate in patients treated with etanercept was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, Benepali 
should not be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution 
when using Benepali in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. 
Wegener's granulomatosis 
A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with etanercept in addition to 
standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median 
duration of 25 months, has not shown etanercept to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s 
granulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly 
higher in patients treated with etanercept than in the control group. Benepali is not recommended for 
the treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes 
There have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of etanercept in patients receiving 
medicinal products for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medicinal products in some 
of these patients. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
In the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall 
differences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older 
who received etanercept were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be 
exercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of 
infections.  
Paediatric population 
Vaccinations 
It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating etanercept therapy (see 
Vaccinations, above). 
Benepali contains sodium 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 50 mg, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
Adult patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious 
infection when compared with patients treated with either etanercept or anakinra alone (historical 
data). 
In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background 
methotrexate, patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of 
serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). The combination etanercept and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is 
therefore not recommended. 
Concurrent treatment with abatacept 
In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased 
incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical 
benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine 
In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which 
etanercept was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant 
decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with etanercept or 
sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use 
caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine. 
Non-interactions 
In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when etanercept was administered with 
glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
analgesics, or methotrexate (see section 4.4 for vaccination advice). 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, 
digoxin or warfarin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Pregnancy 
Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the 
foetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been 
investigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in 
an observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first trimester, 
with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 
95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most commonly reported 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. No change in the 
rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In another observational 
multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to 
etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic medicinal 
products (n=3,497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio 
[OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, 
maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no 
increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for 
infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. Benepali should only be used during 
pregnancy if clearly needed. 
Etanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients 
treated with etanercept during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants 
may be at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the 
mother’s last dose of Benepali is generally not recommended. 
Breast-feeding 
In lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and 
detected in the serum of pups. Limited information from the published literature indicates etanercept 
has been detected at low levels in human milk. Etanercept could be considered for use during 
breast-feeding taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
While systemic exposure in a breastfed infant is expected to be low because etanercept is largely 
degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, limited data regarding systemic exposure in the breastfed infant 
are available. Therefore, the administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG) to a breastfed infant when the 
mother is receiving etanercept could be considered 16 weeks after stopping breast-feeding (or at an 
earlier timepoint if the infant etanercept serum levels are undetectable). 
Fertility 
Preclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility 
and general reproductive performance are not available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Etanercept has no or neglegible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, 
itching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, 
bronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), headache, allergic reactions, development of 
autoantibodies, itching, and fever. 
Serious adverse reactions have also been reported for etanercept. TNF-antagonists, such as etanercept, 
affect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defenses against infection and cancer. 
Serious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with etanercept. Reports have included 
fatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use 
of etanercept, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These 
include rare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral 
demyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with etanercept use. There 
have been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis.

Glomerulo-
nephritis 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders 
One hundred and twenty-nine (129) new malignancies of various types were observed in 4,114 
rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials with etanercept for up to approximately 6 years, 
including 231 patients treated with etanercept in combination with methotrexate in the 2-year active-
controlled study. The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those 
expected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of 
approximately 2 years duration involving 240 etanercept-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical 
studies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were 
reported in etanercept-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with 
etanercept in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and 43 
nonmelanoma skin cancers were reported. 
In a group of 7,416 patients treated with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. 
Reports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been 
received in the post-marketing period (see section 4.4). 
Injection site reactions 
Compared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with etanercept had a significantly 
higher incidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in 
the first month. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the 
majority of injection site reactions in the etanercept treatment groups, and the majority of patients who 
were given treatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. 
Additionally, some patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at 
the most recent site of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at 
previous injection sites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. 
In controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with 
etanercept developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during 
the first 12 weeks of treatment.

Serious infections 
In placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or 
requiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% 
of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with etanercept for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at 
various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, 
endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, 
osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin 
infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In the 2-year active-
controlled study where patients were treated with either etanercept alone, methotrexate alone or 
etanercept in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the 
treatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of etanercept with 
methotrexate could be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. 
There were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with etanercept and those treated 
with placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious 
infections experienced by etanercept-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, 
cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, 
diverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported 
a serious infection (pneumonia). 
Serious and fatal infections have been reported during use of etanercept; reported pathogens include 
bacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few 
weeks after initiating treatment with etanercept in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., 
diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their 
rheumatoid arthritis (see section 4.4). Benepali treatment may increase mortality in patients with 
established sepsis.  
Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with etanercept, including invasive fungal, 
parasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and 
Legionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall 
incidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received etanercept. The 
exposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In post-marketing experience, 
approximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive 
fungal infections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, 
Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half 
of the fatalities amongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports 
with a fatal outcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal 
infections, and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). 
Autoantibodies 
Adult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid 
arthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed 
new positive ANA (≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with etanercept (11%) than in placebo-
treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded 
DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with etanercept 
compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated 
with etanercept compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with 
etanercept who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-
treated patients. The impact of long-term treatment with etanercept on the development of 
autoimmune diseases is unknown. 
There have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have 
developed other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are 
compatible with subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy.  
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia 
There have been post-marketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had 
fatal outcomes (see section 4.4). 
Interstitial lung disease 
In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of 
interstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% 
(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept 
and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% 
(frequency uncommon). There have been post-marketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including 
pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. 
Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
In studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with etanercept plus anakinra, a higher 
rate of serious infections compared to etanercept alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) 
developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient 
developed cellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elevated liver enzymes 
In the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the 
frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving 
etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind 
periods of controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and 
methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 
4.18% (frequency common). 
Autoimmune hepatitis 
In controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of 
autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% 
(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept 
and methotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% 
(frequency uncommon).  
Paediatric population 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in 
frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special 
considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
The types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years 
were generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric 
populations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic 
meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, 
depression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic 
shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. 
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children 
experienced an infection while receiving etanercept during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), 
and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-
label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
patients were similar to those seen in trials of etanercept in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
and the majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis patients receiving 3 months of etanercept compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid 
arthritis patients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.0 event per patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 
0.74 events per patient year). 
There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials. 
Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse 
events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The 
highest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by 
subcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient 
mistakenly self-administered 62 mg etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without 
experiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to etanercept.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, 
ATC code: L04AB01 
Benepali is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with 
psoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque 
psoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in 
psoriatic lesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of 
TNF binding to its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and 
lymphotoxin are pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-
kilodalton (p55) and 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist 
naturally in membrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF 
biological activity. 
TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on 
cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher 
affinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of 
TNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion 
element in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. 
Mechanism of action 
Much of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in 
plaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF 
binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF 
biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional 
downstream molecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or 
regulated by TNF. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, 
one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, two studies 
in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, 
three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. 
Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The 
study evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least 
one but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or 
25 mg etanercept or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive 
months. The results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid 
arthritis using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. 
ACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with etanercept at 3 and 6 months than in 
patients treated with placebo (ACR 20: etanercept 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and 
6 months, respectively: ACR 50: etanercept 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, 
respectively; p < 0.01 etanercept vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 
responses).  
Approximately 15% of subjects who received etanercept achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and 
month 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving 
etanercept, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and 
nearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate 
between placebo and 25 mg. Etanercept was significantly better than placebo in all components of the 
ACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the 
ACR response criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which 
included disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status 
subdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were 
improved in patients treated with etanercept compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. 
After discontinuation of etanercept, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. 
Reintroduction of treatment with etanercept after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the 
same magnitudes of responses as patients who received etanercept without interruption of therapy 
based on results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years 
in open-label extension treatment trials when patients received etanercept without interruption. 
The efficacy of etanercept was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study 
with blinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active 
rheumatoid arthritis (< 3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses 
of 10 mg or 25 mg etanercept were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 
24 months. Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over 
the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset 
of action within 2 weeks with etanercept 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was 
maintained for up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean 
HAQ scores of 1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with etanercept 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 
12 months, with about 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was 
maintained in Year 2 of this study.

In this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total 
Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. 
Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg 
etanercept dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. Etanercept 
25 mg was significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The 
differences in TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and etanercept 
25 mg. The results are shown in the figure below.

In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and 
radiographic progression in RA patients treated with etanercept alone (25 mg twice weekly), 
methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of etanercept and 
methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid 
arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to 
at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. 
Patients in the etanercept in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher 
ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and 
52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). 
Significant advantages for etanercept in combination with methotrexate compared with etanercept 
monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months.

In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to 
have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was 
higher in the etanercept in combination with methotrexate group compared with the etanercept alone 
and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05). The difference between 
etanercept alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p < 0.05). Among patients who 
completed a full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 
61%, respectively. 
The safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly 
were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this 
study, 53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg etanercept once weekly and 
153 patients received 25 mg etanercept twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two 
etanercept treatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of 
RA; data at week 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single 
50 mg/ml injection of etanercept was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 
25 mg/ml. 
Adult patients with psoriatic arthritis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active 
psoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) 
distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules 
and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-
like ankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. 
Patients had previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids 
(24%). Patients currently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable 
dose of ≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-finding studies in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the 
end of the double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total 
duration of up to 2 years. 
Clinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 
response and percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC). Results 
are summarised in the table below.

Among patients with psoriatic arthritis who received etanercept, the clinical responses were apparent 
at the time of the first visit (4 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. Etanercept 
was significantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p < 0.001), and responses 
were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis 
patients was assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index 
score was significantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with etanercept, 
relative to placebo (p < 0.001). 
Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists 
were obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in 
the table below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were 
considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 
12 months was higher in the etanercept group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, 
respectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of etanercept on radiographic progression was maintained in 
patients who continued on treatment during the second year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage 
was observed in patients with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement.

Etanercept treatment resulted in improvement in physical function during the double-blind period, and 
this benefit was maintained during the longer-term exposure of up to 2 years. 
There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of etanercept in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like 
and arthritis mutilans psoriatic arthropathies due to the small number of patients studied. 
No study has been performed in patients with psoriatic arthritis using the 50 mg once-weekly dosing 
regimen. Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been 
based on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. 
Adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
The efficacy of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind 
studies comparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg etanercept with placebo. A total of 401 
patients were enrolled, from which 203 were treated with etanercept. The largest of these trials 
(n = 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing 
spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity 
of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient 
global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 
questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving 
DMARDs, NSAIDS, or corticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete 
ankylosis of the spine were not included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-
finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously 
twice a week for 6 months in 138 patients. 
The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 
Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, 
BASFI, and inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 
70 responses used the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. 
Compared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, 
ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received etanercept, the clinical responses were 
apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. 
Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline.  
Similar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. 
In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered 
once weekly vs. 25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy 
profiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. 
Adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Study 1 
The efficacy of etanercept in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was 
assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated 
215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), 
defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not 
meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate 
response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received 
etanercept 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 
40% improvement in at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the 
remaining domain. The double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all 
patients receive etanercept 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint 
and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104. 
Compared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in statistically significant improvement in the 
ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial 
remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below.

At week 12, there was a statistically significant improvement in the SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis 
Research Consortium of Canada) score for the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as measured by MRI for patients 
receiving etanercept. Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for etanercept treated (n = 95) 
versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n = 105) patients (p < 0.001). At week 104, the mean change from 
baseline in the SPARCC score measured on MRI for all etanercept-treated subjects was 4.64 for the 
SIJ (n=153) and 1.40 the spine (n=154). 
Etanercept showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared 
to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI 
(Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 
Physical Component Score. 
Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received etanercept were apparent at the time of the 
first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related 
quality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data 
did not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral 
Grade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial 
spondyloarthropathy. 
Study 2 
This multi-center, open-label, phase 4, 3-period study evaluated the withdrawal and retreatment of 
etanercept in patients with active nr-AxSpa who achieved an adequate response (inactive disease 
defined as Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) C-reactive protein (CRP) less 
than 1.3) following 24 weeks of treatment.  
209 adult patients with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the 
Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria of axial 
spondyloarthritis (but not meeting the modified New York criteria for AS), having positive MRI 
findings (active inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated with SpA) and/or 
positive hsCRP (defined as high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > 3 mg/l), and active 
symptoms defined by an ASDAS CRP greater than or equal to 2.1 at the screening visit received open 
label etanercept 50 mg weekly plus stable background NSAID at the optimal tolerated anti-
inflammatory dosage for 24 weeks in Period 1. Patients were also required to have an inadequate 
response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. At week 24, 119 (57%) patients achieved inactive 
disease and entered into the Period 2 40-week withdrawal phase where subjects discontinued 
etanercept, yet maintained the background NSAID. The primary measure of efficacy was the 
occurrence of flare (defined as an ASDAS erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than or equal 
to 2.1) within 40 weeks following withdrawal of etanercept. Patients who flared were retreated with 
etanercept 50 mg weekly for 12 weeks (Period 3). 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Period 2, the proportion of patients experiencing ≥1 flare increased from 22% (25/112) at week 4 to 
67% (77/115) at week 40. Overall, 75% (86/115) patients experienced a flare at any time point within 
40 weeks following withdrawal of etanercept.  
The key secondary objective of Study 2 was to estimate time to flare after withdrawal of etanercept 
and additionally compare the time to flare to patients from Study 1 who met the Study 2 withdrawal 
phase entry requirements and continued etanercept therapy.   
The median time to flare following withdrawal of etanercept was 16 weeks (95% CI: 13-24 weeks). 
Less than 25% of patients in Study 1 who did not have treatment withdrawn experienced a flare over 
the equivalent 40-weeks as in Period 2 Study 2. The time to flare was statistically significantly shorter 
in subjects who discontinued etanercept treatment (Study 2) compared to subjects who received 
continuous etanercept treatment (Study 1), p<0.0001. 
Of the 87 patients who entered Period 3 and were retreated with etanercept 50 mg weekly for 12 
weeks, 62% (54/87) reachieved inactive disease, with 50% of them reachieving it within 5 weeks 
(95% CI: 4 8 weeks). 
Adult patients with plaque psoriasis 
Etanercept is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who “failed to 
respond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than 
good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a 
sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least one of the three major systemic therapies as 
available.  
The efficacy of etanercept versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis 
(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing 
etanercept with other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed 
in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four 
studies was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least 
a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. 
Study 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving 
≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were 
randomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of etanercept (n = 57) or placebo (n = 55) twice a week for 24 
weeks. 
Study 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 
1 with the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. 
Etanercept was administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a 
week for 6 consecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, 
patients received placebo or one of the above three etanercept doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, 
patients in the placebo group began treatment with blinded etanercept (25 mg twice a week); patients 
in the active treatment groups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally 
randomised. 
Study 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study 
received a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg etanercept, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all 
patients received open-label 25 mg etanercept twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. 
Study 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this 
study received a dose of 50 mg etanercept or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients 
received open-label 50 mg etanercept once weekly for an additional 12 weeks.

In study 1, the etanercept-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 
75 response at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p < 0.0001). At 24 weeks, 
56% of patients in the etanercept-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-
treated patients. Key results of studies 2, 3 and 4 are shown below.

Among patients with plaque psoriasis who received etanercept, significant responses relative to 
placebo were apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of 
therapy. 
Study 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement 
of at least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the 
occurrence of rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at 
least half of the improvement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, 
symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No 
rebound flare of disease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was 
some evidence to support a benefit of re-treatment with etanercept in patients initially responding to 
treatment. 
In study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and 
had their etanercept dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 
response through week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the 
PASI 75 response continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. 
In study 4, the etanercept-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 
(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p<0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once 
weekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving 
PASI 75 at week 24. 
In long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where etanercept was given without interruption, 
clinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist 
clinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, 
the choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and 
individual patient needs. 
Antibodies to etanercept 
Antibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These 
antibodies have generally been non-neutralising and transient. There appears to be no correlation 
between antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with 
polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset 
types (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to 
severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, 
methotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients 
received 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, 
patients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on etanercept or receive placebo 
for four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, 
defined as 30% improvement in at least three of six and 30% worsening in no more than one of six 
JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent 
global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare 
was defined as a 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and 30% improvement in not 
more than one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. 
In part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In 
part 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on etanercept experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 
26 (77%) patients receiving placebo (p = 0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was 
116 days for patients who received etanercept and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of 
patients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the 
patients remaining on etanercept continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those 
who received placebo did not improve. 
In an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of 
4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive etanercept for up to 10 years. Rates of serious 
adverse events and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. 
Long-term safety of etanercept monotherapy (n = 103), etanercept plus methotrexate (n = 294), or 
methotrexate monotherapy (n = 197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 
2 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, 
infections were more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate 
alone (3.8 versus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. 
In another open-label single-arm study (n=127), 60 patients with extended oligoarthrits (EO) (15 
patients aged 2 to 4, 23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with 
enthesitis-related arthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years 
old) were treated with etanercept at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) 
administered weekly for 12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 
30 criteria and demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender 
joints and physician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other 
JIA studies. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Of the 127 patients in the parent study, 109 participated in the open-label extension study and were 
followed for an additional 8 years for a total of up to 10 years. At the end of the extension study, 
84/109 (77%) patients had completed the study; 27 (25%) while actively taking etanercept, 7 (6%) had 
withdrawn from treatment due to low/inactive disease; 5 (5%) had re-started etanercept following an 
earlier withdrawal from treatment; and 45 (41%) had stopped etanercept (but remained under 
observation); 25/109 (23%) patients permanently discontinued from the study. Improvements in 
clinical status achieved in the parent study were generally maintained for all efficacy endpoints during 
the entire follow-up period. Patients actively taking etanercept could enter an optional withdrawal-
retreatment period once during the extension study based on investigator’s judgement of clinical 
response. 30 patients entered the withdrawal period. 17 patients were reported to have a flare (defined 
as ≥ 30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 ACR Pedi components with ≥ 30% improvement in not more 
than 1 of the remaining 6 components and a minimum of 2 active joints); median time to flare after 
etanercept withdrawal was 190 days. 13 patients were re-treated and the median time to re-treatment 
from withdrawal was estimated as 274 days. Due to the small number of data points, these results 
should be interpreted with caution. 
The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the parent study. 
Studies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of 
continued etanercept therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating etanercept 
therapy. Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of reducing the 
recommended dose of etanercept following its long-term use in patients with JIA. 
Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
The efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an 
sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of 
receiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. 
Patients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At 
week 12, more patients randomised to etanercept had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than 
those randomised to placebo.

After the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 
50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were 
similar to those observed in the double-blind period. 
During a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo 
experienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to 
etanercept. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. 
The long-term safety and effectiveness of etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was 
assessed in an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 years beyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with etanercept was 
generally comparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Etanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) 
method, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. 
Absorption 
Etanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum 
concentration approximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With 
twice-weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high 
as those observed after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg etanercept, the average 
maximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 μg/ml, and the area 
under the curve was 235 ± 96.6 μg × hr/ml. Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in 
treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. 2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC 
of 297 mg × hr/l vs. 316 mg × hr/l for 50 mg etanercept once weekly (n = 21) vs. 25 mg etanercept 
twice weekly (n = 16), respectively. In an open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in 
healthy volunteers, etanercept administered as a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be 
bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. 
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady 
state AUCs were 466 μg × hr/ml and 474 μg × hr/ml for 50 mg etanercept once weekly (n = 154) and 
25 mg twice weekly (n = 148), respectively. 
Distribution 
A biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central 
volume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 L, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 L. 
Elimination 
Etanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is 
approximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of 
0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of etanercept in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. 
There is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females. 
Linearity 
Dose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance 
across the dosing range. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Although there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept 
to patients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with 
acute renal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. 
Hepatic impairment 
Increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The 
presence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
The impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept 
serum concentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to 
estimates in patients less than 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
In a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with etanercept, 69 patients (aged 4 to 
17 years) were administered 0.4 mg etanercept/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration 
profiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children 
(4 years of age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared 
with older children (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older 
children (10-17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children 
will have appreciably lower levels. 
Paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis 
Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum 
steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean 
concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed 
in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to 
maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult 
patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the toxicological studies with etanercept, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. 
Etanercept was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not 
performed with etanercept due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents.  
Etanercept did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single 
subcutaneous dose of 2,000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1,000 mg/kg. Etanercept did not 
elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly 
subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-
based serum concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the 
recommended dose of 25 mg.

Instructions for use (see overleaf) 
1.  What Benepali is and what it is used for 
Benepali contains the active substance etanercept. 
Benepali is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein 
in the body that causes inflammation. Benepali works by reducing the inflammation associated with 
certain diseases. 
In adults (aged 18 and over), Benepali can be used for:  
• 
moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis;  
• 
psoriatic arthritis;  
• 
severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis; 
• 
moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. 
In each case Benepali is used, usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well 
enough or are not suitable for you. 
For rheumatoid arthritis, Benepali is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may 
also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Benepali can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. 
For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Benepali can improve your ability to 
do normal daily activities.  
For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), 
Benepali can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease.  
Benepali is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents. 
97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them: 
  Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients 
from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
  Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them. 
Severe plaque psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who 
have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic 
therapies. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Benepali 
Do not use Benepali 
• 
if you or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as 
chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your 
doctor immediately.  
if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor. 
if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Benepali. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your doctor immediately. 
Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Benepali. 
Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. 
Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If 
you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the 
presence of infections after you stop using Benepali. 
Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Benepali, 
your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Benepali. This 
may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of 
these tests should be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor 
if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, 
listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
Benepali. Treatment with Benepali may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using 
Benepali. 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with Benepali in case the infection worsens. 
Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or 
symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms 
may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require 
discontinuation of Benepali. 
Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of 
the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Benepali is an appropriate treatment. 
Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure, because Benepali needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. 
Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or 
any other cancer before you are given Benepali. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who 
have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing 
lymphoma. Children and adults taking Benepali may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received etanercept 
or other medicines that work the same way as etanercept have developed cancers, including 
unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving Benepali have 
developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the 
appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. 
Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using 
Benepali. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. 
Alcohol abuse: Benepali should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol 
abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse.  
•  Wegener’s granulomatosis: Benepali is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. 
Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while taking Benepali. 
Vaccinations: Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given during Benepali 
therapy. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Benepali is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. 
• 
Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Benepali. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Benepali. 
Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
Benepali should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below 
the age of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or 
psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis 
below the age of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. 
Other medicines and Benepali 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine).  
You or the child should not use Benepali with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Benepali should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.  
If you received Benepali during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. 
In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-
antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no 
increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. Talk to 
your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Benepali treatment. It is important that you tell your 
baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Benepali during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
No information is available if the use of Benepali effects the ability to drive or use machines. 
Benepali contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Benepali 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
If you feel that the effect of Benepali is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Use in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) 
Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis 
The usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. 
However, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject Benepali. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week. 
Alternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week 
or 50 mg once a week. 
Your doctor will decide how long you should use Benepali and whether retreatment is needed based 
on your response. If Benepali has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you 
to stop using this medicine.  
Use in children and adolescents 
Dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight and disease. 
Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate strength of 
etanercept.  
Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given 
once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. 
Other etanercept products with appropriate dosage forms for children are available. 
100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or 
more, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and 
weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given once a week. 
For psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 50 mg 
and should be given once weekly. If Benepali has no effect on the child’s condition after 12 weeks, 
your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. 
The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. 
Method and route of administration 
Benepali is administered by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous use). 
Detailed instructions on how to inject Benepali are provided in section 7 “Instructions for use”. 
Do not mix the Benepali solution with any other medicine. 
To help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Benepali should 
be used. 
If you use more Benepali than you should 
If you have used more Benepali than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or 
by using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer 
carton of the medicine with you, even if it is empty. 
If you forget to use Benepali 
If you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is 
the next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on 
the usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a 
double dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Benepali 
Your symptoms may return upon discontinuation. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

How to store Benepali 
Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label of the pre-
filled syringe after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. 
Keep the pre-filled syringes in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
After taking a syringe from the refrigerator, wait approximately 30 minutes to allow the Benepali 
solution in the syringe to reach room temperature. Do not warm in any other way. Immediate use 
is then recommended. 
Benepali may be stored outside of the refrigerator at temperatures up to a maximum of 30°C for a 
single period of up to 31 days; after which, it should not be refrigerated again. Benepali should be 
discarded if not used within 31 days after removal from the refrigerator. It is recommended that you 
record the date that Benepali is removed from the refrigerator and the date after which Benepali should 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be discarded (no more than 31 days following the removal from the refrigerator). 
Inspect the solution in the syringe. It should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless or pale yellow, 
and may contain small white or almost transparent particles of protein. This appearance is normal for 
Benepali. Do not use this medicine if you notice the solution is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles 
other than those described above are present. If you are concerned with the appearance of the solution, 
then contact your pharmacist for assistance. 
Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

Instructions for use 
Read the instructions for use before you start using Benepali and each time you get a refill of your 
prescription. There may be new information. 
•  Do not try to give yourself the injection unless your doctor or nurse has shown you how to 
give the injection. 
A single-use pre-filled syringe contains one 25 mg dose of Benepali. 
Find a well-lit, clean surface and gather all the equipment you need: 
•  A new Benepali pre-filled syringe  
o 
 Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. 
Not included in pack: 
• 
1 alcohol swab, gauze pad and plaster 
• 
Sharps disposal container  
A.  Before you start 
1.  Inspect the pre-filled syringe: 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe past the expiration date. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped onto a hard surface. Components 
inside the pre-filled syringe may be broken. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the needle cover is missing or not securely attached. 
2.  Inspect the solution: 
Look at the medicine in the pre-filled syringe. 
The medicine should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless or pale yellow, and may contain 
small white or almost transparent particles of protein. 
•  Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described 
above are present. 
3.  Allow the medicine to reach room temperature: 
107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Remove one pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for at 
least 30 minutes before injecting. 
This is important to make the medicine easier and more comfortable to inject. 
•  Do not remove the needle cover until you are ready to inject. 
•  Do not use heat sources, such as a microwave or hot water, to warm Benepali. 
4.  Choose an injection site: 
Front
Back
The Benepali pre-filled syringe is for a subcutaneous injection. It should be injected into the 
thigh, abdomen, or back of the upper arm (see image on the left). 
Rotate the site for each injection. 
If you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is at least 5 cm away from the belly 
button. 
•  Do not inject into areas that are red, hard, bruised, or tender.  
•  Do not inject into scars or stretch marks. 
• 
If you have psoriasis, do not inject into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches, or 
lesions. 
B.  Injection steps 
Step 1: 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: 
Step 3:  
Step 4:  
Step 5: 
Wipe the skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
See ‘Choose an injection site’ for guidance with choosing an 
injection site. 
•  Do not touch this area again before giving the 
injection. 
Pull the needle cover straight off and dispose of it in the 
bin or sharps container. 
See ‘Choose an injection site’ for guidance with choosing an 
injection site. 
•  Do not twist or bend the needle cover while removing 
it, as this may damage the needle. 
•  Do not touch the plunger rod while removing the 
needle cover. 
•  Never recap the needle. 
Gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned injection site. 
Hold the pre-filled syringe at 45 degrees to the skin. 
With a quick, dart-like motion, insert the needle fully 
into the skin. 
You can let go of the skin that you are pinching after the 
needle is completely inserted. 
Slowly push down the plunger to inject all of the 
Benepali solution. 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 6: 
Disposal:  
When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the 
skin at the same angle as inserted. 
•  Never recap the needle. Recapping could lead to a 
needle stick injury. 
Dispose of the entire syringe in an approved sharps 
container. 
Check with your healthcare provider for instructions on how 
to properly dispose a filled sharps container. Sharps disposal 
containers may be purchased at your local pharmacy. 
•  Do not throw the sharps container in household bin. 
•  Do not recycle.  
•  Do not reuse the Benepali pre-filled syringe. 
•  Always keep the container out of the sight and reach 
of children.  
C.  Injection site care 
If there is bleeding at the injection site, press a gauze pad over the injection site. 
•  Do not rub the injection site. 
If needed, cover the injection site with a plaster.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use (see overleaf) 
1.  What Benepali is and what it is used for 
Benepali contains the active substance etanercept. 
Benepali is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein 
in the body that causes inflammation. Benepali works by reducing the inflammation associated with 
certain diseases.  
In adults (aged 18 and over), Benepali can be used for:  
• 
moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis;  
• 
psoriatic arthritis;  
• 
severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis; 
• 
moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. 
In each case Benepali is used, usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well 
enough or are not suitable for you. 
For rheumatoid arthritis, Benepali is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may 
also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Benepali can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. 
For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Benepali can improve your ability to 
do normal daily activities.  
For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), 
Benepali can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease. 
Benepali is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents. 
111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them: 
  Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients 
from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
  Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them. 
Severe plaque psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who 
have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic 
therapies. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Benepali 
Do not use Benepali 
• 
if you or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as 
chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your 
doctor immediately.  
if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor. 
if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Benepali. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your doctor immediately. 
Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Benepali. 
Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. 
Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If 
you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the 
presence of infections after you stop using Benepali. 
Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Benepali, 
your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Benepali. This 
may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of 
these tests should be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor 
if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, 
listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
Benepali. Treatment with Benepali may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using 
Benepali.

Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with Benepali in case the infection worsens. 
Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or 
symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms 
may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require 
discontinuation of Benepali. 
Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of 
the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Benepali is an appropriate treatment. 
Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure, because Benepali needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. 
Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or 
any other cancer before you are given Benepali. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who 
have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing 
lymphoma. Children and adults taking Benepali may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received etanercept 
or other medicines that work the same way as etanercept have developed cancers, including 
unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving Benepali have 
developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the 
appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. 
Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using 
Benepali. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. 
Alcohol abuse: Benepali should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol 
abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse.  
•  Wegener’s granulomatosis: Benepali is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. 
Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while taking Benepali. 
Vaccinations: Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given during Benepali 
therapy. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Benepali is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. 
• 
Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Benepali. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Benepali. 
Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
Benepali should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below 
the age of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or 
psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis 
below the age of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. 
Other medicines and Benepali 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine).  
You or the child should not use Benepali with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
113 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Benepali should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.  
If you received Benepali during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. 
In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-
antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no 
increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. Talk to 
your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Benepali treatment. It is important that you tell your 
baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Benepali during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
No information is available if the use of Benepali effects the ability to drive or use machines. 
Benepali contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 50 mg, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Benepali 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
If you feel that the effect of Benepali is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Use in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) 
Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis 
The usual dose is 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. 
However, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject Benepali. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The usual dose is 50 mg once a week. 
Alternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 50 mg once a week. 
Your doctor will decide how long you should use Benepali and whether retreatment is needed based 
on your response. If Benepali has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you 
to stop using this medicine. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight and disease. 
Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate strength of 
etanercept. Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a week or 50 
mg given once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. 
Other etanercept products with appropriate dosage forms for children are available. 
For polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or 
more, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and 
weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given once a week. 
114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 50 mg 
and should be given once weekly. If Benepali has no effect on the child’s condition after 12 weeks, 
your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. 
The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. 
Method and route of administration 
Benepali is administered by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous use). 
Detailed instructions on how to inject Benepali are provided in section 7 “Instructions for use”. 
Do not mix the Benepali solution with any other medicine. 
To help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Benepali should 
be used. 
If you use more Benepali than you should 
If you have used more Benepali than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or 
by using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer 
carton of the medicine with you, even if it is empty. 
If you forget to use Benepali 
If you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is 
the next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on 
the usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a 
double dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Benepali 
Your symptoms may return upon discontinuation. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

A.  Before you start 
1.  Inspect the pre-filled syringe: 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe past the expiration date. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped onto a hard surface. Components 
inside the pre-filled syringe may be broken. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the needle cover is missing or not securely attached. 
2.  Inspect the solution: 
Look at the medicine in the pre-filled syringe. 
The medicine should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless or pale yellow, and may contain 
small white or almost transparent particles of protein. 
•  Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described 
above are present. 
3.  Allow the medicine to reach room temperature: 
Remove one pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for at 
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least 30 minutes before injecting. 
This is important to make the medicine easier and more comfortable to inject. 
•  Do not remove the needle cover until you are ready to inject. 
•  Do not use heat sources, such as a microwave or hot water, to warm Benepali. 
4.  Choose an injection site: 
Front
Back
The Benepali pre-filled syringe is for a subcutaneous injection. It should be injected into the 
thigh, abdomen, or back of the upper arm (see image on the left). 
Rotate the site for each injection. 
If you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is at least 5 cm away from the belly 
button. 
•  Do not inject into areas that are red, hard, bruised, or tender.  
•  Do not inject into scars or stretch marks. 
• 
If you have psoriasis, do not inject into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches, or 
lesions. 
B.  Injection steps 
Step 1: 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: 
Step 3:  
Step 4:  
Step 5:

•  Do not twist or bend the needle cover while removing 
it, as this may damage the needle. 
•  Do not touch the plunger rod while removing the 
needle cover. 
•  Never recap the needle. 
Gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned injection site. 
Hold the pre-filled syringe at 45 degrees to the skin. 
With a quick, dart-like motion, insert the needle fully 
into the skin. 
You can let go of the skin that you are pinching after the 
needle is completely inserted. 
Slowly push down the plunger to inject all of the 
Benepali solution. 
122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 6: 
Disposal:  
When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the 
skin at the same angle as inserted. 
•  Never recap the needle. Recapping could lead to a 
needle stick injury. 
Dispose of the entire syringe in an approved sharps 
container. 
Check with your healthcare provider for instructions on how 
to properly dispose a filled sharps container. Sharps disposal 
containers may be purchased at your local pharmacy. 
•  Do not throw the sharps container in household bin. 
•  Do not recycle.  
•  Do not reuse the Benepali pre-filled syringe.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use (see overleaf) 
1.  What Benepali is and what it is used for 
Benepali contains the active substance etanercept. 
Benepali is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein 
in the body that causes inflammation. Benepali works by reducing the inflammation associated with 
certain diseases. 
In adults (aged 18 and over), Benepali can be used for:  
• 
moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis;  
• 
psoriatic arthritis;  
• 
severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis; 
• 
moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. 
In each case Benepali is used, usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well 
enough or are not suitable for you. 
For rheumatoid arthritis, Benepali is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may 
also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Benepali can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. 
For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Benepali can improve your ability to 
do normal daily activities.  
For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), 
Benepali can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease. 
Benepali is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents. 
124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them: 
  Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients 
from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
  Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. 
For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them. 
Severe plaque psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who 
have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic 
therapies. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Benepali 
Do not use Benepali 
• 
if you or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as 
chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your 
doctor immediately.  
if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor. 
if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Benepali. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your doctor immediately. 
Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Benepali. 
Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. 
Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If 
you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the 
presence of infections after you stop using Benepali. 
Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Benepali, 
your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Benepali. This 
may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of 
these tests should be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor 
if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, 
listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
Benepali. Treatment with Benepali may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using 
Benepali.

Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with Benepali in case the infection worsens. 
Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or 
symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms 
may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require 
discontinuation of Benepali. 
Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of 
the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Benepali is an appropriate treatment. 
Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure, because Benepali needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. 
Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or 
any other cancer before you are given Benepali. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who 
have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing 
lymphoma. Children and adults taking Benepali may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received etanercept 
or other medicines that work the same way as etanercept have developed cancers, including 
unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving Benepali have 
developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the 
appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. 
Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using 
Benepali. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. 
Alcohol abuse: Benepali should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol 
abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse.  
•  Wegener’s granulomatosis: Benepali is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. 
Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while taking Benepali. 
Vaccinations: Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given during Benepali 
therapy. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Benepali is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. 
• 
Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Benepali. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Benepali. 
Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. 
Benepali should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below 
the age of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or 
psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis 
below the age of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. 
Other medicines and Benepali 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine).  
You or the child should not use Benepali with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 
Benepali should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.  
If you received Benepali during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. 
In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-
antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no 
increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. Talk to 
your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Benepali treatment. It is important that you tell your 
baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Benepali during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
No information is available if the use of Benepali effects the ability to drive or use machines. 
Benepali contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 50 mg, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Benepali 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
If you feel that the effect of Benepali is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Use in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) 
Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis 
The usual dose is 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. 
However, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject Benepali. 
Plaque psoriasis 
The usual dose is 50 mg once a week. 
Alternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 50 mg once a week. 
Your doctor will decide how long you should use Benepali and whether retreatment is needed based 
on your response. If Benepali has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you 
to stop using this medicine. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight and disease. 
Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate strength of 
etanercept. Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a week or 50 
mg given once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. 
Other etanercept products with appropriate dosage forms for children are available. 
For polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or 
more, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and 
weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given once a week. 
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 50 mg 
and should be given once weekly. If Benepali has no effect on the child’s condition after 12 weeks, 
your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. 
The doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. 
Method and route of administration 
Benepali is administered by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous use). 
Detailed instructions on how to inject Benepali are provided in section 7 “Instructions for use”. 
Do not mix the Benepali solution with any other medicine. 
To help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Benepali should 
be used. 
If you use more Benepali than you should 
If you have used more Benepali than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or 
by using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer 
carton of the medicine with you, even if it is empty. 
If you forget to use Benepali 
If you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is 
the next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on 
the usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a 
double dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Benepali 
Your symptoms may return upon discontinuation. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

7. 
Instructions for use 
Read the instructions for use before you start using Benepali and each time you get a refill of your 
prescription. There may be new information. 
•  Do not try to give yourself the injection unless your doctor or nurse has shown you how to 
give the injection. 
A single-use pre-filled pen contains one 50 mg dose of Benepali. 
Find a well-lit, clean surface and gather all the equipment you need: 
•  A new Benepali pre-filled pen 
o  Do not shake the pre-filled pen. 
Not included in pack: 
• 
• 
1 alcohol swab, gauze pad and plaster 
Sharps disposal container  
A.  Before you start 
1.  Inspect the pre-filled pen: 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled pen label. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled pen past the expiration date. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled pen if it has been dropped onto a hard surface. Components inside 
the pre-filled pen may be broken. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled pen if the needle cap is missing or not securely attached. 
2.  Inspect the solution: 
Look at the medicine through the viewing window. 
The medicine should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless or pale yellow, and may contain 
small white or almost transparent particles of protein. 
•  Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described 
above are present. 
3.  Allow the medicine to reach room temperature: 
Remove one pre-filled pen from the carton that is stored in the refrigerator and leave at 
room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. 
This is important to make the medicine easier and more comfortable to inject. 
133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject. 
•  Do not use heat sources, such as a microwave or hot water, to warm Benepali. 
4.  Choose an injection site: 
Front
Back
The Benepali pre-filled pen is for a subcutaneous injection. It should be injected into the 
thigh, abdomen, or back of the upper arm (see image on the left). 
Rotate the site for each injection. 
If you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is at least 5 cm away from the belly 
button. 
•  Do not inject into areas that are red, hard, bruised, or tender.  
•  Do not inject into scars or stretch marks. 
• 
If you have psoriasis, do not inject into any raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches, or 
lesions. 
B.  Injection steps 
Step 1: 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: 
Step 3:  
Step 4:  
Step 5: 
Wipe the skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
See ‘Choose an injection site’ for guidance with choosing 
an injection site. 
•  Do not touch this area again before giving the 
injection. 
Pull the needle cap straight off and dispose of it in the 
bin or sharps container. 
•  Do not twist or bend the needle cap while removing it, 
as this may damage the needle. Do not recap the needle.  
•  Never recap the needle. 
Gently stretch the skin at the cleaned injection site. 
Position the pre-filled pen approximately 90 degrees to 
the skin. 
•  Do not pinch the skin. 
•  Stretching the skin creates a firm surface. 
Firmly press the pre-filled pen down into the site to start 
the injection. 
The device will click when the injection begins.  
Continue to hold the pre-filled pen firmly pressed into 
the site. 
The device will click a second time.

Step 6: 
Step 7: 
Disposal:  
After the second click, count slowly to 15 to make sure 
that the injection is complete. 
•  Do not release pressure against the injection site before 
the injection is complete. 
•  Do not move the pre-filled pen during the injection. 
Remove the empty pen from the skin. 
The needle guard will completely cover the needle. 
Check for the yellow plunger rod in the window to con-
firm that the full dose has been delivered. 
Dispose of the empty pen in an approved sharps 
container. 
Check with your healthcare provider for instructions on how 
to properly dispose a filled sharps container. Sharps disposal 
containers may be purchased at your local pharmacy. 
•  Do not throw the sharps container in household bin. 
•  Do not recycle. 
•  Always keep the container out of the sight and reach 
of children.  
C.  Injection site care 
If there is bleeding at the injection site, press a gauze pad over the injection site. 
•  Do not rub the injection site. 
If needed, cover the injection site with a plaster.

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisation(s) 
Annex IV 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for etanercept, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  risk  of  occurrence  of  glomerulonephritis  from  the  literature  and 
spontaneous  reports  in  post-marketing  surveillance,  including  in  some  cases  a  close  temporal 
relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between etanercept 
and  glomerulonephritis  cannot  be  excluded.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of 
medicinal products containing etanercept should be amended accordingly.  
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall 
conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for etanercept the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing etanercept is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

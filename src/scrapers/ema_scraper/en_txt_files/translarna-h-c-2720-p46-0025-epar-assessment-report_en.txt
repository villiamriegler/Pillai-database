1.  Introduction 
On 7 August 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study 020e “A Phase 3 Extension Study 
of Ataluren (PTC124) in Patients with Nonsense Mutation Dystrophinopathy”, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study 020e “A Phase 3 Extension Study of Ataluren (PTC124) in Patients with 
Nonsense Mutation Dystrophinopathy” is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Ataluren used in Study 020e is the same drug as approved in EU. It is a white to off-white granules for 
oral suspension packaged in child-resistant sachets (packets) and supplied in dose strengths containing 
125, 250, or 1000 mg of the active drug substance, which is 25% of the total formulation weight. The 
excipients were tested to pharmaceutical or food grade and are generally safe. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
DMD  is  a  X-linked  genetic  disorder  (Worton  2001,  Khurana  2003)  caused  by  defects  in  the  gene  for 
dystrophin (Lapidos 2004). The role of the dystrophin protein is to act as a shock absorber, bearing the 
mechanical  stresses  that  occur  during  muscle  contraction,  stabilizing  muscle  cell  membranes,  and 
protecting  muscles  from  injury  (Petrof  1993).  In  the  absence  of  dystrophin,  the  shear  placed  on  the 
membranes during contractions causes  them to  tear,  leading to membrane damage and muscle loss. 
Progressive  muscle  weakness  is  seen  initially  in  the  lower-extremity  muscles  and  later  in  the  upper 
extremity, respiratory, and cardiac muscles.  Deterioration of ambulation occurs in the first decade of 
life,  wheelchair  dependency  in  the  second  decade,  and  eventual  respiratory  and  cardiac  failure  with 
death  by  the  third  or  fourth  decade  (Passamano  2012).  Supportive  care  and  off-label  use  of 
corticosteroids (usually prednisone or deflazacort) are currently the main treatment options. Mutation-
specific  therapies  aimed  at  restoring  dystrophin  production,  including  ataluren  and  exon-skipping 
drugs,  are  being  investigated,  and  ataluren  is  marketed  for  this  indication  in  DMD.  The  goal  of 
dystrophin restoration therapies is to slow the progression of DMD (Merlini 2015). 
Ataluren  is  an  orally  bioavailable  drug,  has  a  Marketing  Authorization  in  Europe,  Chile,  Israel,  South 
Korea and Brazil and is investigational in other regions. Ataluren promotes ribosomal read through of 
premature stop codons, enabling production of full-length dystrophin (Welch 2007).  
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study  020e  “A  Phase  3  Extension  Study  of  Ataluren  (PTC124)  in  Patients  with  Nonsense 
Mutation  Dystrophinopathy ”;  Study  020e  was  a  Phase  3  safety  extension  study  following 
Study 020 of ataluren (PTC124) in patients with nonsense mutation DMD.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study  020e  “A  Phase  3  Extension  Study  of  Ataluren  in  Patients  with  Nonsense  Mutation 
Dystrophinopathy” 
Description 
Study 020e was an international, open-label, single group, extension of the previous specific obligation 
study  for  conditional  market  authorization,  Study  020.  Study  020e  included  patients  with  nonsense 
mutation DMD who successfully completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of study 020. 
Note: a new specific obligation study to further confirm clinical efficacy in nmDMD patients is currently 
ongoing.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the extension phase was to obtain long-term ataluren safety data to augment 
the  ataluren  safety.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to  augment  the  efficacy  data  collected  in  the 
double-blind study (Study 020). 
Study design 
Study 020e was a Phase 3, international, open-label, single group, extension safety and efficacy study. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study enrolled 218 patients with nonsense mutation DMD, aged ≥7 to ≤16 years of age, who had 
successfully  completed  the  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Study  020.  A  total  of  68  patients 
completed 144 weeks of treatment. One patient discontinued due to an AE (anxiety of mild intensity). 
The high rate of study non-completion was due primarily to the commercial availability of ataluren.

CHMP comment 
The main reason for drop out is the availability of commercial ataluren. It can be questioned whether 
this  is  a  valid  justification  for  study  discontinuation  considering  that  DMD  patients  are  screened 
regularly and data could have been collected. 
This issue will not be pursued as the MAH is currently conducting a long-term safety and efficacy study 
in  patients  on  commercially  available  ataluren  (study025o).  In  addition,  the  MAH  is  conducting  a 
confirmative randomized placebo control study in nmDMD patients aged >5 years of age.  
Treatments 
All patients received ataluren administered three times a day (morning, noon, and evening at 10, 10, 
and 20 mg/kg, respectively). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
All AEs and laboratory abnormalities were assessed as the primary endpoints in this extension study. 
The  secondary  endpoints  of  this  study  included  physical  assessment  (6MWT,  TFT,  NSAA,  and  PUL), 
pulmonary assessments, patient-reported outcomes (PODCI and ADL), and exposure assessments. 
Statistical Methods/ Handling of data 
Several  patients  had  early  terminations  or  unscheduled  visits  during  the  study,  thus  the  derived 
analysis  visits  were  generated  by  visit  window  defined  according  to  Section  6.1  of  the  SAP  (Section 
16.1.9).  Imputation rules for missing/incomplete date information for AEs and for prior or concomitant 
medications are provided in Section 6.4 of the SAP.  
No interim analyses were planned for this extension study.  
Data from all sites were pooled for all analyses unless otherwise specified based on ITT. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Two-hundred-eighteen (218) patients, 198 ambulatory and 20 non-ambulatory were treated in Study 
020e.  
Baseline data 
The mean age at baseline was 9.9 years with 80% of the patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years, 
inclusive.  The  majority  (77.5%)  of  patients  were  white.  Mean  baseline  6-minute  walk  distance  was 
317.95 meters with little difference in the number of patients between baseline walk distance groups of 
<300 meters, ≥300 - <400 meters, and ≥400.  
Safety results 
The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  ( ≥ 15%)  included 
nasopharyngitis  (26.1%),  disease  progression  (25.7%),  fall  (22%),  headache  (19.3%),  and  vomiting 
(17.0 %). Based on exposure-adjusted event rates, headache (23.2%), nasopharyngitis (19.8%), fall 
(15.2%)  and  vomiting  (14.2%),  were  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs.  The  exposure-adjusted 
event rate for disease progression was 11.2%.  
Loss of ambulation was recorded as disease progression on the AE case report form in this study.

There  were  no  TEAEs  leading  to  fatal  outcomes;  one  TEAE  (anxiety)  of  mild  intensity  led  to  study 
discontinuation.  Forty-four  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in  24  patients  (11%),  none  of  which  were 
considered  related  to  study  drug.  Sixteen  (7.3%)  patients  had  serious  TEAEs  that  were  also  severe 
(Grade  3)  in  intensity  and  2  patients  had  life-threatening  events,  including  hypoxia,  femur  fracture, 
hypotension, bradycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumonia aspiration, all of which 
resolved.  Thirty-five  patients  had  51  adrenal,  hepatic  or  renal  TEAEs  that  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
intensity  except  for  1  event  each  of  nephrolithiasis  and  hematuria,  that  were  severe  (Grade  3)  in 
intensity.  A  total  of  68  TEAEs  in  44  (20.2%)  patients  were  reported  as  being  related  to  study 
medication.  Hematuria  (n  =  11)  was  the  only  related  preferred  term  occurring  in  ≥5%  of  patients. 
Narratives for these patients are in CSR 020e Section 12.3.2. 
Mean high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, and triglycerides levels 
were  in  the  upper  range  of  normal/borderline  high  at  baseline.  Small  mean  increases  in  LDL,  total 
cholesterol, and triglycerides levels were observed; but  were not  considered  clinically relevant. There 
were no Grade 2, 3 or 4 TEAEs for hypercholesterolemia or for hypertriglyceridemia. 
Laboratory  monitoring  of  adrenal,  renal  and  hepatic  function  revealed  no  evidence  of  injury  to  these 
organ systems. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in any other laboratory 
parameters at any post-baseline assessment. 
There  were  no  clinically  significant  differences  from  baseline  in  vital  sign  measurements.  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  were  prehypertensive  or  hypertensive  during  the  study  was  relatively 
consistent with that observed at baseline. No clinically meaningful abnormalities were identified based 
on physical examinations. 
Clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities were present in 2 (0.9%) patients at baseline and 
in 3 (1.4%) patients at Week 48. 
CHMP comment 
The adverse events reported are in line with the adverse events known for the patients aged  ≥5years 
of age. Electrocardiogram abnormalities, which was reported in 1 more patient compared to baseline, 
could also be associated with the disease  progression. Overall, no  clinically  significant mean changes 
were observed in vital sign parameters. 
Efficacy results 
Note to reader  
Efficacy was assessed as a secondary outcome and a comparator arm is lacking.  
The  MAH’s  Critical  Expert  Overview  focused  on  the  outcomes  in  non-ambulatory  patients,  i.e.  age  at 
loss  of  ambulation,  forced  vital  capacity  and  Performance  of  the  Upper  Limb  (PUL).  This  focus  may 
wrongfully  suggest  that  the  patients  included  in  the  study  were  non-ambulant.  To  correctly  balance 
this report also the assessments in ambulatory patients (i.e. 6-MWD, TFT and NSAA,) which were the 
main group included is presented.  
In  the  CSR-body  submitted  by  the  MAH  focused  on  the  48-week  results.  However,  this  study  lasted 
144 weeks. To allow adequate representation of the efficacy data collected during the 144 weeks, the 
tables presented below were made by the assessor.

CHMP comment 
There appears to be a gradual decline in the performance of the 6-MWD. Patients with higher baseline 
values remained longer in the study.  
Overall, no conclusions on efficacy can be drawn, due to lack of a comparator.  
Timed function Tests 
For  the  overall  population,  the  mean  (SD)  time  to  walk/run  10  meters  at  baseline  was  8.71  (6.592) 
seconds. At 48 weeks the time to walk/run 10 meters had increased by 1.66 (3.579) seconds. 
At  baseline,  the  mean  (SD)  time  to  ascend  4  stairs  was  9.03  (8.939)  seconds  for  the  overall 
population; the mean (SD) time to descend 4 stairs was 7.52 (8.401) seconds. At 48 weeks, the mean 
(SD) time to ascend 4 stairs increased by 2.41 (4.329) seconds over baseline; the time to descend 4 
stairs increased by 1.92 (4.827) seconds over baseline.

North Star Ambulatory Assessment 
The NSAA mean (SD)  total score at baseline  was 20.73 (8.513) for ambulatory patients. The change 
from baseline at 48 weeks was -3.41 (4.082). Of the 17 NSAA items the greatest loss of function at 48 
weeks was noted for the ability to jump (28.4%), the ability to stand on heels (27%), the ability to hop 
on right and left legs (25.2% and 26.5%, respectively), and the ability to rise from the floor (25.0%).

Not only the ability to jump, stand on heels, hop (right and left leg) and rise from floor change is lost 
in 25% of the patients. Also, the ability to rise from a chair (20.9%), climb box steps (21.3% R, 24.8 
L) and descend box steps were reduced in approximately 20% of the patients. This is not unexpected 
as the average age of patients was 9.9 years at study entry. A decline in function is expected, however 
the actual decline in function may be higher than presented by the MAH as missing data is handled by 
last observation carried forward.  
No conclusion on efficacy of ataluren can be drawn as the primary aim of the study was to assess the 
safety. The efficacy is considered only exploratory as a comparison is lacking.  
Age at Loss of Ambulation 
At study entry, 198 patients (90.8%) were ambulatory, 20 were not. During the study period,59/198 
patients  lost  ambulation.  Based  on  Kaplan-Meier  analysis,  the  median  age  at  loss  of  ambulation  was 
15.3 years (95% confidence interval 13.36, 16.40). Among patients who used deflazacort, the median 
age  at 
loss  of  ambulation  was  16.1  years  and  14.0  years 
for  patients  who  used 
prednisone/prednisolone.  The  median  age  at  loss  of  ambulation  was  13.4  years  for  patients  with  a 
cumulative  corticosteroid  use  of  <12  months  at  study  entry,  and  15.7  years  for  patients  with  ≥12 
months of corticosteroid use prior to study entry.

CHMP comment 
No conclusions can be drawn on the data presented. It is unclear why the Applicant also performed KM 
analysis  comparing  deflazacort  to  prednisone/prednisolone  and  comparing  corticosteroid  use  of  <12 
months to >12 months use. These are known factors that impact the outcome. However, the analysis 
performed do not allow any conclusion on whether ataluren lengthens the time to loss of ambulation as 
there is no comparator arm present in the study.  
Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity 
At 48 weeks the mean (SD) changes from baseline for percent predicted forced vital capacity (%pFVC) 
and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%pFEV1) were 9.82% (14.88) and 9.76% 
(16.743),  respectively  in  patients  (n  =  17)  who  were  non-ambulatory  at  baseline.  Results  for  peak 
expiratory flow (PEF) and peak cough flow (PCF) were consistent with other spirometry outcomes.

CHMP comment 
There  is  a  gradual  decline  in  the  spirometry  performance,  which  is  not  unexpected,  based  on  the 
population included in the study. Due to the lack of a comparator arm, no conclusions can be drawn

Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL)  
The mean PUL total score for the last visit was 65.9 among ataluren-treated patients in the As-treated 
Population  between  the  ages  of  13  and  21.9.  For  the  subset  of  patients  in  this  age  group  who  were 
non-ambulatory at their last visit, the mean total last visit PUL score was 61.1. Pull total score and per 
dimension are presented for the as-treated group, non-ambulatory group and natural history control in 
Figure 2.

CHMP comment 
The MAH present comparative PUL data to a historical control. However, no information is provided on 
how  the  control  group  was  constructed.  For  further  comments  on  the  use  of  external  controls  in  a 
safety  study,  see  also  the  Type  II  variation,  modification  of  the  current  therapeutic  indication 
(EMEA/H/C/002720/II/0047). No conclusions can be drawn on the data presented above. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study concerns the extension phase of the previous specific obligation study, i.e. Study 020, to 
establish efficacy in ambulatory patients aged >5 years of age. A new specific obligation study is 
currently ongoing. 
The MAH submitted efficacy and safety data of 144 weeks ataluren treatment. A total of 219 patients 
were included, however only 68 completed the study. The MAH indicated that this is due to commercial 
availability. It is questioned if this is a valid justification for study discontinuation considering that DMD 
patients are screened regularly and data could have been collected. This issue will not be pursued as 
currently 2 trials are ongoing addressing the efficacy and safety.   
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nasopharyngitis 
(26.1%), disease progression (25.7%), fall (22%), headache (19.3%), and vomiting (17.0 %). The is 
in line with the already known safety profile of ataluren.  
No conclusions on efficacy in ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients can be drawn due to the design 
of the study, i.e. powered on safety and lack of a comparator arm.

The MAH does not propose any changes to the SmPC, which is endorsed. As the applicant has provided 
the  final  study  results  as  obligated,  the  requirements  of  the  paediatric  article  46  are  considered 
fulfilled.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No claims are made by the MAH in this procedure. No amendments to the SmPC are proposed by the 
MAH, which is endorsed. Therefore, the Paediatric Article 46 requirement is considered fulfilled with no 
regulatory action required.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

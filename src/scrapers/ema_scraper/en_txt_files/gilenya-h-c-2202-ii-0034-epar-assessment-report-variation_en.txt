Fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya) is an oral, once daily, synthetic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 
modulator that is marketed in the European Union (EU) under the name Gilenya for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P 
receptors on lymphocytes, fingolimod-phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from 
lymph nodes, causing a redistribution of lymphocytes. 
This redistribution reduces the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes into the CNS, where they would be 
involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage. Fingolimod readily crosses the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) to bind to S1P receptors located on neural cells in the CNS which may reduce 
proinflammatory activity and inhibit astrogliosis. Due to the presence of S1P receptors in multiple tissues, 
fingolimod manifests a number of other biological effects in addition to the reduction in circulating 
lymphocytes. These include a transient reduction in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction upon 
treatment initiation, a dose-dependent mild increase in airway resistance, macular edema, a mild 
increase in blood pressure, and asymptomatic elevations in serum levels of hepatic transaminases. 
GILENYA (fingolimod) 0.5 mg has been approved on March 2011 and its current indication is the 
following:  
“Gilenya  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) for the following adult patient groups:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 6/66 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for 
exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients should have 
had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions 
in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” could also be defined as a 
patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as  compared  to  the 
previous year. 
or  
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling 
relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a  significant 
increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI”. 
Fingolimod at 0.5 mg daily demonstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses by greater than 
50% as compared to both placebo (2-year Study FTY720D2301) and IFN-β1a (1–year Study 
FTY720D2302) in patients with RRMS as well as in reducing the risk of disability progression relative to 
placebo over 2 years. The clinical benefits of fingolimod were further supported by the robust efficacy 
seen on MRI measures, including a significant reduction in the number of new T2 lesions and gadolinium 
(Gd)- enhancing lesions, decreased total T2 and T1 lesion burden, and reduction in brain volume loss 
(BVL). 
Based on the principles used in the revision to the McDonald criteria led to updated diagnostic criteria that 
accounted for subclinical disease activity as evidenced by MRI lesions, the MAH submit a type II variation 
to update section 4.1 of SmPC “Therapeutic indications”. This submission seeks to modify the criteria for 
disease activity that need to be fulfilled in order to enable a switch from a first line disease modifying 
therapy (DMT) to Gilenya. 
The wording for section 4.1 which was applied for was the following:  
“Gilenya  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
- Patients with high active disease activity defined by clinical or imaging features despite a 
full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and 
information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
-  These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients should have 
had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2- hyperintense lesions 
in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “nonresponder” could also be defined as a 
patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as  compared  to  the 
previous year. 
or 
-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain 
MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.” 
According to the proposal, the disease activity is to be defined by either clinical or imaging features, 
instead of the current label wording which refers to highly active disease criteria defined by imaging and 
clinical features. With the currently proposed modification in the indication Gilenya would remain as 
second line therapy except in patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS (which remains unchanged).

2.2.1.2.  Phase I: Estimation of exposure 
2.2.1.2.1.  Assessment of persistence, bioaccumation and toxicity 
Based on the fact that fingolimod is a surface active substance, diffusion of fingolimod through an octanol 
liquid membrane is considered as the most reliable parameter to assess the partition coefficients for this 
API.  This  experiment  revealed  a  log  P  value  of  5.5  and  extrapolated  log  D  at  pH  7.4  of  4.5., 
therefore exceeding the trigger value for screening for bioaccumulation potential.  
A screening for bioaccumulation potential has subsequently been conducted according to the criteria laid 
down in the current guidance on PBT assessment used for the implementation of REACH (ECHA, 2008) 
leading to the conclusion that fingolimod cannot be considered as PBT or vPvB substance for the following 
reasons: 
• 
The  criteria  for  persistence  is  not  fulfilled  as  a  study  on  transformation  in  aquatic  sediment 
systems following OECD 308 showed half-lives of 0.23 - 0.25 days for the water phase and 0.35 – 0.39 
days for the total systems (Harlan Laboratories Study  B53998). These results suggest rapid degradation 
of fingolimod in surface waters and consequently no risk for the aquatic environment and no significant 
bioaccumulation potential. 
• 
As the relevant pathway investigated by the current environmental risk assessment according to 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 is via patient use, it has to be taken into account that fingolimod will pass the 
human body and be significantly metabolised before excretion by patients and subsequently entry into 
the environment. In this regard, about 81% of a dose of fingolimod has been found to be excreted in the 
urine as pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Only 2.5% of the dose is excreted by patients as parent 
substance in faeces. 
• 
Considering  results  from  aquatic  toxicity  testing,  the  criteria  for  toxicity  is  not  fulfilled  as  No 
Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) from chronic toxicity testing in fish, Daphnia and algae do not 
meet the trigger value of 0.01 mg/L with NOECs of 0.090 mg/L, 0.089 mg/L, 0.020 mg/L for zebra fish, 
Daphnia  and  algae  growth  rate  reduction,  respectively  (RCC  Study  B54022),  (RCC  Study  B54000), 
(NOTOX Study 305101).

Fingolimod log D was 4.5. Fingolimod did not meet the criteria for persistence and toxicity 
2.2.1.2.2.  Calculation if the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is given by the formula proposed in guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00: 
PECsurface water = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION) 
= (0.5 mg * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10) 
= 0.0025 µg/L 
Where:  
DOSEai 
= 0.5 mg/inhabitant/day 
Fpen 
= 1% (default) 
WASTEWinhab = 200 L/inhabitant/day 
= 10 
DILUTION 
CHMP comment 
PECsurfacewater is below the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, fingolimod is unlikely to represent a 
risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. Nevertheless the applicant had 
submitted PhII ERA which was assessed.

2.2.1.3.3.  Calculation of PNEC using assessment factors 
The PNECsurface water derived from the NOEC for algae as the most sensitive species is  
0.0203 mg/L /10 = 2.03 µg/L. 
For microorganisms, an assessment factor of 10 is generally used, hence the PNECmicroorg. derived 
from the activated sludge respiration inhibition  study is 26.0 mg/L / 10 = 2.6 mg/L. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 9/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PNECgroundwater is based on the NOEC of the test with Daphnia sp. and applying an assessment 
factor of 10 thus calculates as 0.089 mg/L / 10 = 8.9 µg/L. 
2.2.1.3.4.  PECs 
PECsurfacewater is 0.0025 µg/L (see 1.2). 
Based on the default dilution factor of 10 used between surface water and sewage treatment plants, the 
PECmicroorg is ten times higher than the PECsurface water. 
PECmicroorg = 0.025 µg/L 
According to the guideline, the PECgroundwater can be assumed to be typically 0.25 times the PECsurface water. 
This leads to a PECgroundwater of 0.000625 µg/L for fingolimod.  
2.2.1.4.  Outcome of Tier A fate and effects analysis 
Surface water assessment 
Refined PECsurface water = 0.0025 µg/L 
PNECsurface water = 2.03 µg/L 
PEC/PNECsurface water = 0.0025 µg/L / 2.03 µg/L= 0.00123 
Microorganisms / sewage treatment plant assessment 
PECmicroorg. = 0.025 µg/L 
PNECmicroorg = 2.6 mg/L = 2600 µg/L 
PEC/PNECmicroorg. = 0.025 µg/L / 2600 µg/L = 0.0000096 
Groundwater assessment 
PECgroundwater = 0.000625 µg/L 
PNECgroundwater = 8.9 µg/L  
PEC/PNECgroundwater = 0.000625 µg/L / 8.9 µg/L = 0.00007 
All the PEC/PNEC are below the trigger values. No further action is required.

2.2.1.5.  Conclusion on ERA 
Based on the high lipophilicity of fingolimod a screening for PBT potential has been conducted for this 
active pharmaceutical ingredient. Fingolimod is not readily biodegradable, but shows very short half-lives

in water-sediment systems and does therefore not fulfill the criteria for persistence. Moreover, the 
pathway considered for APIs in the current ERA, i.e. through use in patients, is expected to result in very 
low amounts of fingolimod entering the environment based on extensive metabolism during patient’s 
passage. In spite of significant toxicity found in aquatic organisms, the criteria for toxicity is not met 
based on the chronic toxicity studies. In general, fingolimod cannot be considered a PBT or vPvB 
substance. 
The low persistence of fingolimod in water-sediment systems and consequently low partitioning of 
fingolimod to sediments suggests no risk for sediment compartments. Moreover, the potential to adsorb 
to sludge has been found to be low resulting in no concern for terrestrial compartments.  
In the current ERA, the highest risk ratio has been observed for surface waters with 0.00123, thus 
remaining significantly below any concern for the environment, including surface waters, groundwater, 
sewage treatment plants, sediments and terrestrial compartments. 
In spite of the fact that no concern for the environment is anticipated from the use of fingolimod by 
patients, intake of active pharmaceutical ingredients into surface waters should be avoided as far as 
possible. Therefore, as with all non-readily biodegradable human medicines, patients should be advised 
not to dispose of unused drug product via sinks or toilets. The package leaflet accompanying FTY720 drug 
product should thus include the following statement: “Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater 
or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These 
measures will help to protect the environment.” 
Based on the assessment, no concern has been raised regarding fingolimod impact on the aquatic 
environment, the microorganisms, the sediment or the terrestrial compartment. Fingolimod did not meet 
the criteria for persistence and toxicity. No further studies are necessary. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of fingolimod.  
- Considering the above data, fingolimod is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Updated diagnostic criteria for MS acknowledge the role of MRI as an important and sensitive measure of 
disease activity relevant to MS diagnosis: at the core of the 2010 revision to the McDonald criteria (after 
fingolimod approval) is the importance of considering subclinical disease activity as evidenced by MRI 
lesions (Polman et al 2011). Capturing dissemination of subclinical activity through MRI in time (rather 
than clinical dissemination in time alone) allows a more rapid diagnosis and earlier treatment of MS as per 
the revised diagnostic criteria. Appearance of new MRI activity, even if clinically silent, is considered 
sufficient to diagnose the patient with having the disease that can negatively impact long-term patient 
outcomes if not treated in a timely manner. 
Acute MS disease activity is a consequence of focal disruption of the BBB with ensuing infiltration of 
auto-reactive immune cells into a region of the CNS parenchyma that ultimately results in edema, 
demyelination, and axonal injury. Such an event, if occurring in a clinically eloquent region, will result in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 11/66 
 
 
 
 
 
a clinical relapse, an acute deterioration of the patient’s physical or cognitive functioning. It is a purely 
random occurrence if this focal pathology will induce a clinical relapse or remain silent. In the latter case, 
such MS activity would be evidenced by MRI. 
While it has been shown that MS relapses are associated with the appearance of “active” Gd T1 lesions on 
MRI scans (Noseworthy et al 2000), the frequency of active MRI lesions outnumber relapses (Thorpe et al 
1996). New Gd-enhancing lesions, even when completely asymptomatic, are associated with significant 
demyelination and axonal loss and up to 55% of them may become chronic T1 hypointense lesions (ie, 
“black holes”) indicative of permanent tissue loss (Bagnato et al 2003). This accumulation of permanent 
tissue loss, as seen on MRI, ultimately has proven prognostic value for disability progression (Rieckmann 
2005, Goodin and Bates 2009, Gold et al 2010). 
The MAH position was that for patients who already receive a DMT, evidence of MRI activity could be an 
indicator of poor response with consecutive risk of treatment failure leading to relapses or permanent 
clinical progression. Thus, the occurrence of MRI activity in this setting would justify a treatment switch 
to prevent future disability. Rio et al (2008) showed that active and new MRI lesions can predict future MS 
disease course. Patients receiving IFN-β1a and with high numbers of new MRI lesions have significantly 
more disease progression i.e. were treatment non-responders (Rudick et al 2004). In patients treated 
with IFN-β, development of new T2-hyperintense lesions and Gd lesions predicted long-term response to 
therapy (Prosperini et al 2009, Bermel et al 2013). The ability of MRI changes (new T2 lesions and the 
presence of Gd enhancement) to predict long-term clinical outcomes was confirmed by Dobson et al 
(2014). Further evidence of the prognostic value of MRI in identifying poor responders can be obtained 
from meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Sormani et al 2009) and a more recent 
meta-analysis that included fingolimod studies (Sormani and Bruzzi 2013). 
Based on the above, the MAH claimed that the totality of data available in the published literature at this 
point supported the conclusion that the effectiveness of DMTs could be assessed by MRI active lesions and 
that MRI activity correlated with long-term clinical outcomes. 
This was the reasoning to propose revision of the second-line part of the fingolimod indication to: 
“patients with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features despite treatment with at least 1 
DMT.” Based on this proposal fingolimod would still remain a second-line therapy, with the exception of 
patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS as per current SmPC. 
The post-hoc efficacy analyses provided by the MAH aimed to show that the overall treatment effect in the 
current SmPC population and, in conjunction with a comparable safety profile for these populations, the 
benefit-risk ratio remained favorable. To confirm that efficacy remained consistent under the conditions 
of the proposed updated indication, efficacy was compared in the full analysis set (FAS)-current SmPC 
and FAS-proposed SmPC subpopulations using data from pooled and individual controlled studies. 
To further support the proposed change in the SmPC, additional study groupings were identified and 
subgroups defined to examine the treatment effect in the presence or absence of a priori defined clinical 
and/or imaging features. 
Clinical activity was defined as 1 relapse in the previous 6 months, as this cut-off has been described as 
an appropriate time to evaluate the efficacy of a DMT and potentially trigger a decision for treatment 
switch (Teter et al 2014). Patients receiving DMT treatment for 6 months and experiencing relapses may 
be considered as having a suboptimal response to treatment. MRI activity was defined as Gd+ lesions at 
baseline MRI scan, as such lesions often result demyelination (later evidenced as T2 lesions). 
These comparisons (in the supportive analysis based on subgroups defined by imaging and/or clinical 
features) were conducted in:

Patients with prior DMT exposure in the pooled placebo-controlled, 2-year Studies D2301 + 
D2309  
Patients with prior DMT exposure in active-controlled, 1-year Study D2302  
Patients who received IFN-β1a during the core study of Study D2302 and switched to receiving 
fingolimod 0.5 mg during extension Study D2302E1 (using data from the 12-month dose-blind 
phase of the extension study)  
Within these groups of patients, the following subgroups were evaluated: 
- 
- 
- 
Patients with imaging AND clinical features 
Patients with imaging OR clinical features (but not both) 
Patients who comprised the proposed SmPC (i.e. “patients with imaging features only” and 
“patients with clinical features only”). 
The first 2 of these subgroups were chosen to represent the patient populations covered by the current 
label as compared to the proposed label; the patients with imaging AND clinical features represent 
patients in the current SmPC and patients with imaging OR clinical features represent additional patients 
in the proposed SmPC but not in current SmPC. For completeness, treatment effects were also evaluated 
for the second 2 subgroups for patients who comprised the proposed SmPC (ie, “patients with imaging 
features only” and “patients with clinical features only”) and all analyses were presented for the endpoint 
of ARR.As RRMS patients experience relapses that lead to accumulation of disability over time a reduction 
in relapses is therefore an acceptable endpoint, also relevant for long-term outcomes. 
The ARR (relapse rate) endpoint was assessed in all clinical studies conducted, and was the primary 
endpoint in the Phase 3 studies with fingolimod. Since ARR is widely used for the demonstration of 
efficacy in patients with RRMS, in the context of this submission, ARR provides a meaningful clinical 
endpoint to be analyzed in the selected subgroups. Disability progression (Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS)) was not analyzed in the subgroups; the low number of patients with disability progression 
during the relatively short duration of the studies would not provide reliable estimates.

2.3.2.1.  Overview of efficacy studies relevant to the current procedure 
The post-hoc efficacy analyses for this submission are based on data from all randomized, placebo- and 
active-controlled, double-blind studies which included the approved 0.5 mg dose: Studies D2301, D2309, 
D2302, and D1201 and Study D2302E1. 
Study D2301 and Study D2302 formed the basis of the original MAA submission (2009). 
Study D2309 and Study D2302E1 were ongoing at the time of the initial submission for fingolimod; these 
studies have since been completed. Full results from completed [Study D2309] were provided in the 
submission for the Follow-up Measure (FUM)-009 and full results from [Study D2302E1] were provided in 
FUM-008.

Study D2301 was a 24-month double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg administered orally once daily  
versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The efficacy evaluations included 
relapses, EDSS, MSFC and MRI.  
Study D2302 was a 12-month double-blind, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel group 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg fingolimod (FTY720) administered orally 
once daily versus interferon β-1a (Avonex®) administered i.m. once weekly in patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Study D2309 was 24-month double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg fingolimod administered orally once daily 
versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  
Study D2302E1 was an extension of the 12-month double-blind, randomized, multicenter, 
active-controlled, parallel group study comparing the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg 
fingolimod (FTY720) administered orally once daily versus interferon β-1a (Avonex®) administered i.m. 
once weekly in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  
Study D1201 was a 6-month, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
trial that enrolled 171 patients with relapsing MS at 43 centers in Japan. Patients were randomized to 
receive oral fingolimod 1.25 mg/day, fingolimod 0.5 mg/day, or placebo. The primary objective was to 
evaluate the effect of 2 doses (0.5 mg and 1.25 mg) of fingolimod compared to placebo on the percentage 
of patients free of Gd-enhancing T1 weighted MRI lesions at both 3 months and 6 months of treatment. 
This study enrolled a patient population with substantially higher disease activity than that in the other 
studies; this study has not been submitted previously and the study report was included with this 
submission. 
The doses of 0.5 mg, 1.25 mg, and 5 mg/day have been evaluated in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in 
MS. In this submission, the emphasis is placed on the approved dose of fingolimod 0.5 mg as compared 
to placebo or IFN-β1a. 
2.3.2.2.  Summary of controlled efficacy studies 
The randomized, controlled, double-blind studies of at least 6 months duration were conducted on a total 
of 3818 patients (Randomized population).  
For the D2302/D2302E1 post-hoc analyses, data from the 12-month core study (Study D2302) and the 
12-month dose-blind phase of the extension study (Study D2302E1) were used. 
Prospectively collected data from the core phase of Study D2302 for patients receiving IFN- β1a were 
compared with data from the extension of Study D2302E1. Patients who received IFN-β1a during the core 
phase of Study D2302 were re-randomized to fingolimod (1.25 mg or 0.5 mg) for extension Study 
D2302E1. 
Study groupings used for efficacy analyses 
For the evaluation based on the current and proposed SmPC (see Table 1-3), the following data were used 
from the Phase 2 and 3 placebo- and active-controlled studies as listed below: 
- 
Pooled data from Studies D1201, D2301, and D2309 (all placebo-controlled, double-blind with at 
least 6 months duration)

Pooled data from Studies D2301 and D2309 (placebo-controlled, double-blind with 2 years of 
treatment duration and comparable design) 
Study D2301 
Study D2309 
Study D1201 
Study D2302 (active-controlled, double-blind with 1 year of treatment duration) 
The above studies comprise data from all randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind 
studies of at least 6 months duration which included the approved 0.5 mg dose of fingolimod (Studies 
D1201, D2301, D2302, and D2309). 
Study groupings for imaging and/or clinical features subgroups 
For the evaluation based on imaging and/or clinical features, the following 3 study groupings were 
defined: 
- 
- 
- 
Pooled data from Studies D2301 and D2309 (placebo-controlled, double-blind with 2 years of 
treatment duration and comparable design) 
Study D2302 (active-controlled, double-blind with 1 year of treatment duration) 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
Study D1201, 6 months duration, was not included in the pooled study grouping due to the small number 
of patients in the study, resulting in low (single digit) patients in the according subgroups.  
For the third study grouping (Study D2302/D2302E1), a within-subgroup comparison was conducted for 
patients who were re-randomized from IFN-β1a during Study D2302 to fingolimod 0.5 mg during the 
extension of Study D2302E1. These post-hoc analyses are considered supportive given the prospective 
collection of data during the core study phase. 
The data provide a detailed understanding of MRI activity and DMT exposure prior to switching to 
fingolimod 0.5 mg. It is noted that patients who are included in the analyses from Study D2302/D2302E1 
for this submission received IFN-β1a for the full 12 months during the core phase prior to switching to 
fingolimod. 
Subpopulation and subgroup definitions 
Definition of current and proposed SmPC subpopulations 
The objective of this submission was to revise the Gilenya indication to: “patients with active disease 
defined by clinical or imaging features despite treatment with at least 1 DMT.” 
To support the proposed label change, 2 subpopulations were defined and analyzed based on the MS 
history data collected during the studies at Baseline: the FAS-current SmPC and the FAS-proposed SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 15/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall FAS population represents patients who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study 
medication. This includes patients who were previously treated with DMTs and patients who were 
treatment naïve. The FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC, however, include only patients who 
were previously treated in the year prior to treatment initiation (with the exception of rapidly progressing 
patients), leading to a notable difference in the number of patients in the FAS compared to the 
FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC subpopulations (see Table 1-4). 
For the FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC it is noted that the definition for patients with rapidly 
evolving severe RRMS remains the same for both subpopulations. 
Prior DMTs are defined as any prior MS medication as reported by the investigator on the case report form 
at baseline. This definition includes the 5 treatments that were approved at the time of the conduct of the 
Phase 3 trials (IFN-β1a im, IFN-β1a sc, IFN-β1b sc, glatiramer acetate, and natalizumab) and also “other 
MS medications”, e.g. investigational treatments. 
MRI activity in the FAS-proposed SmPC subpopulation is defined as the presence of Gd enhancement at 
the baseline MRI scan. New or newly enlarging T2 lesions could not inherently be included in the 
subpopulation definition since determination of this variable would require comparison to a previous scan, 
which was not planned in the clinical studies. 
It is noted that patients included in FAS-current SmPC account for more than 95% of patients included in 
FAS-proposed SmPC in the pooled studies of interest. The inclusion criteria of the studies required 
patients to have clinical disease activity during the year prior to randomization, with the majority of the 
patients having relapses in the year prior to randomization. Therefore, there is a notable overlap between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 16/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the patients included in each subpopulation due to the inclusion criteria, leading to a small difference 
between the FAS-proposed SmPC and FAS-current SmPC for pooled Studies D1201 + D2301 + D2309 
and Study D2302 (Table 1-4). For that reason, the difference between the FAS-current SmPC and the 
FAS-proposed SmPC was not evaluated. The number of patients included in the overall FAS, FAS-current, 
and FAS-proposed are presented in Table 1-4. 
Definition of imaging and/or clinical features subgroups 
To further support the proposed label change which would allow second-line treatment in RRMS patients 
with disease activity defined by either imaging and/or clinical features, further subgroups were defined 
for the evaluation based on imaging and/or clinical features (Table1.5). 
MRI activity in the imaging subgroups is defined as the presence of Gd enhancement at the baseline MRI 
scan. New or newly enlarging T2 lesions could not inherently be included in the imaging subgroup 
definition since determination of this variable would require comparison to a previous scan which was not 
planned in the clinical studies. 
For the subgroups defined for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 and Study D2302 the time period used to 
define clinical features (i.e. relapse) was 6 months prior to randomization. The 6 month time frame has 
been described as an appropriate time to evaluate the efficacy of a DMT and potentially trigger a decision 
for treatment switch (Teter et al 2014).  
For the evaluation based on imaging and/or clinical features including pooled data from Studies D2301 + 
D2309 and Study D2302, patients were considered who were previously treated with DMTs 1 year prior 
to randomization and that had MRI at Baseline, and relapse 6 months prior to randomization. In these 3 
Phase 3 studies where ARR was the primary endpoint, an “active” patient population was studied. For 
inclusion, the patients should have had 1 relapse in the past year (vast majority of patients, 97%) or 2 
relapses in the past 2 years. 
In this submission for the subgroup analysis, ‘clinical features’ was defined as 1 relapse or more in the 
past 6 months, as this would extract the most clinically “active” patients from the Phase 3 patient 
population. 
Treatment effect for fingolimod vs control based on ARR was evaluated for each subgroup as reduction in 
relapse rate is considered relevant for long-term clinical outcomes. In addition, demonstration of the 
efficacy of fingolimod on ARR in the Phase 3 studies is consistent with other relapse-related variables 
(proportion of relapse-free patients; time to first relapse) and MRI endpoints that mark inflammatory 
disease activity (number of Gd lesions, new/ newly enlarging T2 lesions, brain volume).

MRI endpoints were not analyzed, as the focus of this submission is to demonstrate benefit on clinical 
endpoints in patients receiving DMT with MRI activity. Disability progression is not analyzed in the 
subgroups; the low number of patients with disability progression in relatively small subgroups of patients 
would not provide reliable estimates. In summary, ARR is included as a relevant and representative 
parameter for demonstration of the efficacy of fingolimod in the subpopulations and for the purpose of 
this submission. 
The numbers of patients included in each of the study groupings by analysis population and by subgroup 
are presented in Table 1-6.

2.3.2.3.  Results 
Summary of results of individual studies not assessed in other procedures 
All studies (Studies D2301, D2302, D2309 and SD1201) demonstrate a comparable, clinically meaningful 
effect on ARR (48% to 54% reduction for fingolimod 0.5 mg vs comparator placebo or IFN-β1a). 
The main efficacy results on ARR for Gilenya have been demonstrated in studies D2301 and D2302 which 
had been submitted for initial marketing authorization application.  A third study (D2309) was completed 
after registration and has shown comparable results. Study D2302E1 was a 12 month, optional extension 
phase of Study D2302 consisting of a double-blind/dose-blind period followed by an open-label period 
and was assessed in the context of a post –approval measure.  
Study D1201  was a 6 month, double-blind, placebo -controlled randomized study in patients 18 to 60 
years, with RRMS and an EDSS score of 0 to 6.0 who had had at least one relapse in the previous year or 
at least two relapses in the previous two years. Less than half of all patients were treatment naïve 
(approximatively 42-49% across the groups). Among those who had been previously treated, interferon 
beta had been used (95%). In this trial 2 doses of fingolimod were tested (0.5 mg and 1.25 mg, once a 
day). Only results with the 0.5 mh dose are of interest. The Primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion 
of patients free of Gd enhanced T1 weighted MRI lesions at both month 3 and month 6. 
The population has included 69% of women. The mean age was 35.3. The mean duration of the disease 
was 7.9 years and the mean of relapses in the last year was 1.5 and in the last two years 2.4. The mean 
EDSS score was 2.10. The number of randomized patients in each group was 57. 
The results on primary efficacy parameter (ITT population) showed statistically significantly higher 
percentage of patients free of Gd-enhanced T1 lesions at both Month 3 and Month 6 with 0.5 mg ( 70%)   
versus placebo (40.4) ; odds ratio (95%CI) for 0.5 mg 3.628 (1.504, 8.753), p:0.004. 
Regarding the results on the  secondary MS relapse-related endpoint, fingolimod 0.5 mg decreased the 
aggregate ARR estimates at Month 6 (0.50 for fingolimod 0.5 mg) with statistically significant reductions 
compared to placebo (49% (p=0.047)) compared to placebo. 
Overall incidence of AEs by proportion of patients was higher in the 2 fingolimod treatment groups than 
in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AEs in the fingolimod treatment group were 
nasopharyngitis and liver function test abnormal.

Combined efficacy data analysis 
Statistical analyses 
Evaluation based on the current and proposed SmPC 
The efficacy endpoint analyzed for this SCE is ARR based on confirmed relapses only. This endpoint was 
analyzed by study and in a meta-analysis for the pooled studies (ie, Studies D1201 + D2301 + D2309 and 
Studies D2301 + D2309) and was assessed for the overall FAS, FAS-current SmPC, FAS-proposed SmPC. 
The ARR of a treatment group was calculated as the sum of the number of confirmed relapses of all 
patients in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all patients in the group and 
multiplied by 365.25. As previously noted, other clinical endpoints such as disability progression are not 
analyzed in this submission; the low number of patients with disability progression in relatively small 
subgroups of patients would not provide reliable estimates. 
The treatment effect based on ARR was evaluated by between-group comparisons in ARR for fingolimod 
1.25 mg vs placebo and fingolimod 0.5 mg vs placebo for pooled Studies D1201 D2301 + D2309, pooled 
Studies D2301 + D2309, and individual Study D1201, Study D2301, and Study D2309 (see Table 2-1). 
The treatment effect for fingolimod 1.25 mg vs IFN-β1 and fingolimod 0.5 mg vs IFN-β1a was evaluated 
by between-group comparisons in ARR based on Study D2302. Comparisons of fingolimod 0.5 mg are the 
main presentations and included in-text below; comparisons of fingolimod 1.25 mg are considered 
supportive and are included in post-text summaries. 
Results from an alternate random effects model based on pooled studies D1201 + D2301 D2309 were 
also provided for evaluation of treatment effect assuming uncommon effect size between studies. 
To determine if the treatment effect differed between different placebo-controlled studies, an exploratory 
p-value was obtained from the global type 3 test of the study-by-treatment interaction from the statistical 
model on the 3 subgroups (FAS, FAS-current SmPC, and FAS-proposed SmPC) for the pooled Studies 
D1201 + D2301 + D2309 and pool Studies D2301 + D2309. 
No multiplicity adjustment was applied to these efficacy analyses. These post-hoc analyses as such have 
limitations; data for the evaluation of efficacy for subgroups are reviewed in their totality. Of note, only 
the efficacy of the fingolimod 0.5 mg (approved dose) is of interest for this submission and the fingolimod 
1.25 mg comparisons to placebo or IFN-β1a are used as supportive evidence. 
A summary of the analyses conducted for ARR is presented in Table 2-1.

Evaluation based on imaging and/or clinical features  
For analysis based on pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 and Study D2302, as previously noted, the efficacy 
endpoint analyzed for this SCE is ARR (confirmed relapses only). For analyses based on imaging and/or 
clinical features, the treatment effect of fingolimod 0.5 mg vs comparator treatment was estimated for 
ARR based on the same fixed effect model included in Table 2-1 and was analyzed by study (Study 
D2301, D2309, and D2302) and for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 for each subgroup defined in Table 
1-5. A summary of the analyses conducted for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 and Study D2302 is 
presented in Table 2-2. 
For analyses based on Study D2302/D2302E1, a within-subgroup comparison of ARR during the 
extension (Month 12 to Month 24) vs ARR during the core phase (Month 0 to Month 12) was conducted for 
each subgroup defined in Table 1-6. A summary of the analyses conducted for Study D2302/D2302E1 is 
presented in Table 2-2. 
Depending on the size of the subgroup, the models may not have converged, in which case, a reduced 
model without baseline covariate(s) was applied to the corresponding subgroup(s) interest.

Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
Study populations 
A summary of the number of patients included in the overall FAS, FAS-current, and FAS-proposed is 
presented in Table 3-1. In the overall FAS, there were 3803 patients, of which, 1786 patients and 1831 
patients were included in the FAS-current SmPC and FAS proposed SmPC, respectively. There is a notable 
overlap between the patients included in the FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC subpopulations. 
As previously noted, the overall FAS population represents patients who were randomized and took at 
least 1 dose of study medication. This includes patients who were previously treated with DMTs and 
patients who were treatment naïve. The FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC, however, includes 
only patients who were previously treated in the year prior to treatment initiation (with the exception of 
rapidly progressing patients), leading to a notable difference in the number of patients in the FAS 
compared to the FAS-current SmPC and FAS-proposed SmPC subpopulations.

Comparison of efficacy results of all studies 
ARR for evaluation based on the current and proposed SmPC Studies (Studies D2301 and 
D2309) 
The primary data presented for ARR analysis for evaluation based on the current and proposed SmPC are 
the pooled placebo-controlled Studies. 
The data presented below provide evidence that patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in 
subpopulations defined to closely match the current SmPC and proposed SmPC demonstrate treatment 
benefits based on reductions in ARR. 
In both subpopulations (current restricted indication and proposed broader indication populations) of the 
pooled studies (D2301 + D2309), there was a significant percent reduction in ARR (45.7% and 44.8% 
reduction, respectively) in the fingolimod groups compared to placebo (p<0.0001). Additionally, a 
significant percent reduction in ARR was observed for the overall initial population (52.1%) in the 
fingolimod group compared to placebo (p<0.0001), with a similar reduction as was observed for both 
subgroups. There was a consistent reduction in ARR for fingolimod compared to placebo for all 
populations, overall initial population (naïve and previously treated patients), as well for current 
restricted indication and proposed broader indication populations (subpopulations of patients who were 
all previously treated with DMT).

For the pooled Studies D1201 + D2301 + D2309, there was an ARR reduction of 52% in the overall 
population, 45.6% in the current restricted population and 45% in the proposed broader population as 
compared to placebo. 
Comparison of ARR results in subgroups 
This section includes results for the evaluation based on imaging and/or clinical features which identifies 
subgroups based on the presence or absence of MRI lesions and/or relapses prior to receiving fingolimod. 
The study groupings included for this analysis are: 
1. Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 
2. Study D2302 
3. Study D2302/D2302E1 
For each of the 3 study groupings above, the following 4 subgroups were defined for this analysis : 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Patients with imaging AND clinical features 
Patients with imaging OR clinical features (but not both) 
Patients with imaging features only (“imaging AND NO clinical features”) 
Patients with clinical features only (“NO imaging AND WITH clinical features”)

The “imaging AND clinical features” subgroup represents patients covered by the current SmPC. 
The “imaging OR clinical features” subgroup represents the additional patients with active disease 
who would be included in the proposed SmPC but not in the current SmPC. 
The “imaging OR clinical features” subgroup is pooled from 2 other subgroups: “imaging AND NO 
clinical features” and “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features”. 
Number of patients by subgroup 
Patient disposition and study discontinuation by subgroup 
Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309

In pooled Studies D2301 + D2309, the proportion of patients who completed the study for all 4 subgroups 
was greater for patients in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group (range: 79.5% to 85.2%) compared with patients 
in the placebo group (range: 64.2% to 76.9%). 
Study D2302 
Patient disposition and reasons for discontinuing the study were similar across the subgroups. 
The proportion of patients who completed the study was slightly greater for patients in the fingolimod 0.5 
mg group (range: 91.9% to 94.9%) compared with patients in the IFN-β1a group (79.3% to 91.5%). 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
The proportion of patients who received IFN-β1a during Study D2302 and switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg 
during Study D2302E1 and discontinued the study prior to 24 months during the extension phase was 
similar across all 4 subgroups (range: 15.8% to 17.9%). 
Demographics and MS disease baseline characteristics by subgroup 
Demographics 
Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 
 Overall, demographics were similar across all 4 subgroups in pooled Studies D2301 + D2309. 
The mean age ranged from 36.7 to 40.1 years, as expected there were notably more women (range: 
73.3% to 76.9%), and the majority of patients were Caucasian (approximately 90%).

Overall, demographics were similar across all 4 subgroups in Study D2302. The mean age ranged from 
34.3 to 38.0 years, as expected there were notably more women (range: 67.1% to 72.6%), and the 
majority of patients were Caucasian (>91%). 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
Demographics in each of the 4 subgroups are presented for patients who received IFN-β1a 
during Study D2302 and switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg during Study D2302E1 in 
[SCS-Appendix 1-Table S3.3-1.1a, Table S3.3-1.1b, Table S3.3-1.1c, and Table S3.3-1.1d]. 
Overall, demographics were similar across all 4 subgroups for patients included in the Study 
D2302/D2302E1 analysis. The mean age was ranged from 34.0 to 38.2 years, there were notably more 
women (range: 64.2% to 68.4%), and the majority of patients were Caucasian (range: 88.7% to 100%). 
MS disease history 
Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 
MS disease history in each of the 4 subgroups is presented for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 in 
[SCS-Appendix 1-Table S2.4-1.1a, Table S2.4-1.1b, Table S2.4-1.1c, and Table S2.4-1.1d]. 
Overall, MS disease history was similar across all 4 subgroups in pooled Studies D2301 + D2309. The 
duration of MS since first symptom was approximately 9.5 years and the number of relapses in the 
previous year ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 relapses. For the subgroup of “imaging AND NO clinical features”, 
the mean time since onset of most recent relapse was notably longer (10.49 months prior to 
randomization) compared with the subgroups of “imaging AND clinical features” (3.67 months), “imaging 
OR clinical features” (6.16 months), and “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features” (3.78 months), as

expected based on the definition of this subgroup (patients who had a Gd-enhancing T1 lesion at Baseline 
and no relapse during the 6 months prior to randomization). 
Study D2302 
Overall, MS disease history was similar across all 4 subgroups in Study D2302. The duration of MS since 
first symptom ranged from 8.13 to 9.47 years and the number of relapses in the previous year ranged 
from 1.2 to 1.9 relapses. For the subgroup of “imaging AND NO clinical features”, the mean time since 
onset of most recent relapse was notably longer (10.52 months since randomization) compared with the 
subgroups  of  “imaging  AND  clinical  features”  (3.62  months),  “imaging  OR  clinical  features”  (5.67 
months),  and  “NO  imaging  AND  WITH  clinical  features”  (3.68  months),  as  expected  based  on  the 
definition of this subgroup (patients who had a Gd-enhancing T1 lesion at Baseline and no relapse during 
the 6 months prior to randomization). 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
Overall,  MS  disease  history  was  similar  across  all  4  subgroups  for  patients  included  in  the  Study 
D2302/D2302E1  analysis.  The  mean  duration  of  MS  since  first  symptoms  was  slightly  higher  for  the 
subgroup of “NO imaging  AND WITH clinical features” (10.35 years) compared with the subgroups of 
“imaging AND clinical features” (7.50 years), “imaging OR clinical features” (7.31 years), and “imaging 
AND NO clinical features” (6.22 years). The mean number of relapses in the previous year ranged from 
1.3 to 1.5 relapses, and the time of onset since the most recent relapse was approximately 6.5 months. 
MRI baseline characteristics 
Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 
Overall, MRI baseline characteristics were representative of the subgroups based on their respective 
definitions for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309. For example, for the subgroups of “imaging AND clinical 
features” and “imaging AND NO clinical features”, all patients included in these subgroups by definition 
had a Gd-enhancing T1 lesion at Baseline, therefore, the proportion of patients free of Gd-enhancing T1 
lesions at Baseline is 0 for both subgroups. 
Similarly, for the subgroup of “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features”, no patients in this subgroup were 
to have a Gd-enhancing T1 lesion at Baseline, therefore, the number and volume of Gd-enhancing T1 
lesions at Baseline is 0 for this subgroup. 
Study D2302 
As noted for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309, MRI baseline characteristics were representative of the 
subgroups based on their respective definitions for Study D2302. 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
The majority of patients who were randomized in Study D2302 and are included in 4 defined subgroups 
did not have a Gd-enhancing T1 lesion at Baseline (the proportion of patients free of Gd-enhancing T1 
lesions at Baseline is >50% in 3 of the 4 subgroups); however, patients did have notable T2 lesion burden 
(median lesion volume: 5164, 3395, 2712, and 3774 mm3 for “imaging AND clinical features”, “imaging 
OR clinical features”, “imaging AND NO clinical features”, and “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features”, 
respectively). 
ARR by subgroup 
The data in subsequent sections provide evidence that patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 28/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subgroups defined by imaging and clinical features demonstrate treatment benefits based on reductions 
in ARR in placebo- and active-controlled studies and in patients who received 12 months of treatment 
with IFN-β1a and were re-randomized to receive fingolimod 0.5 mg. 
As previously noted, no multiplicity adjustment was applied to these efficacy analyses. These post-hoc 
analyses as such, have limitations; data for the evaluation of efficacy for subgroups are reviewed in their 
totality. 
Pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 
A summary of ARR by subgroup for pooled Studies D2301 + D2309 is presented in Table 3-5;  
Patients with both “imaging AND clinical features” (representing the current SmPC) had a lower ARR when 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 29/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with placebo (41.5% reduction in ARR). 
For patients representing the proposed SmPC who were previously treated with DMTs and who had MRI 
activity at Baseline or with relapse in the 6 months prior to randomization, not both (“imaging OR clinical 
features”), a lower ARR was observed when treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with placebo 
(38.5% reduction in ARR). 
Patients previously treated with DMTs who had MRI activity at Baseline and without relapse in the 6 
months prior to randomization (“imaging AND NO clinical features”) demonstrated the greatest reduction 
in ARR, with a lower ARR when treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with placebo (75.4% reduction 
in ARR). 
For the subgroup of patients without MRI activity at Baseline and with a relapse in the 6 months prior to 
randomization (“NO imaging AND WITH clinical features”), the treatment outcome on ARR for patients 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg was comparable to the other subgroups (ARR=0.30) and the reduction in 
ARR compared with placebo was 13.1%. The lower magnitude of the relative treatment effect may be 
explained by the fact that lower MRI disease burden is associated with less relapse activity evidenced by 
the outcome in the placebo group. 
The results across all 4 subgroups demonstrate that all patients with imaging and/or clinical features at 
Baseline have a reduced ARR when switching from another DMT to fingolimod 0.5 mg. 
Study D2302 
A summary of ARR by subgroup for Study D2302 is presented in Table 3-6. 
Patients with both “imaging AND clinical features” (matching the current SmPC) had a lower ARR when 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with IFN-β1a (56.4% reduction in ARR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 30/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients matching the proposed SmPC who were previously treated with DMTs and who had MRI 
activity at Baseline or with relapse in the 6 months prior to randomization, but not both (“imaging OR 
clinical features”), a lower ARR was observed when treated with 
fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with IFN-β1a (53.8% reduction in ARR) in line with the results observed for 
the subgroup of patients with both “imaging AND clinical features”. 
Patients previously treated with DMTs who had MRI activity at Baseline and without relapse in the 6 
months prior to randomization (“imaging AND NO clinical features”) demonstrated the greatest reduction 
in ARR, with a lower ARR when treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with IFN-β1a (69.8% reduction 
in ARR). 
Similarly for patients without MRI activity at Baseline and with a relapses in the 6 months prior to 
randomization (NO imaging AND WITH clinical features), a reduction in ARR was observed for patients 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared with IFN-β1a (42.2% reduction in ARR). 
Study D2302/D2302E1 
A summary of ARR by subgroup for patients who received IFN-β1a during Study D2302 and then switched 
to fingolimod 0.5 mg during Study D2302E1 is presented in Table 3-7. 
Upon switching from IFN-β1a (Month 0 to 12) to fingolimod 0.5 mg (Month 12 to 24), a lower ARR was 
observed for the subgroup of “imaging AND clinical features” (0.642) with a substantial reduction in ARR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 31/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 52.2%. 
The subgroup of “imaging OR clinical features” comprises to a substantial degree the patients with no 
relapses and only imaging during Month 0 to 12, which leads to a reduced ARR for this subgroup. A 
reduction in ARR of 37.1% was observed (0.230) from Month 12 to 24. 
Upon switching from IFN-β1a (Month 0 to 12) to fingolimod 0.5 mg (Month 12 to 24) a lower ARR was 
observed on fingolimod for the subgroup of “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features” (0.501) with a 
reduction in ARR of 64.4%. 
The reduction in ARR is consistent across these 3 subgroups, demonstrating that patients defined by 
imaging and/or clinical features have a reduced ARR when switching from 
IFN-β1a to fingolimod 0.5 mg. 
It should be noted that for the subgroup of “imaging AND NO clinical features”, ARR was 0 due to the 
definition of this subgroup (patients had no relapses from Baseline to Month 12 of 
Study D2302). Therefore, the ARR in these patients by definition could only numerically increase from 
Month 0 to 12 to Month 12 to 24. The ARR observed for this subgroup was low on fingolimod for Month 12 
to 24 (0.136). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Post-hoc analyses of data from previously submitted studies and a newly submitted study (D1201) have 
been performed to support the proposed indication of Gilenya. 
The MAH has compared the results on ARR between two subpopulations corresponding respectively to the 
current  restricted  indication  and  to  the  proposed  broader  indication  and  extracted  from  the  overall 
population of the abovementioned studies. In the pooled data analysis submitted by the applicant, the 
new  conditions  proposed  for  the  broader  indication  provide  a  difference  in  size  between  the  current 
restricted and proposed new indication sub-populations included in these data of only around 2%. 
Regarding  the  results  of  the  new  data  analysis  proposed  by  the  applicant,  the  clinical  efficacy 
demonstrated  in  previously  submitted  studies  are  confirmed  in  the  subpopulations  and  subgroups 
targeted in this new analysis. In both subpopulations (current restricted indication and proposed broader 
indication populations) of the pooled studies (D2301 + D2309), there was a significant percent reduction 
in  ARR  (45.7%  and  44.8%  reduction,  respectively)  in  the  fingolimod  groups  compared  to  placebo 
(p<0.0001).  Additionally,  a  significant  percent  reduction  in  ARR  was  observed  for  the  overall  initial 
population (52.1%) in the fingolimod group compared to placebo (p<0.0001), with a similar reduction as 
was observed for both subgroups. The consistency between the subpopulations was also observed within 
the  individual  studies  (Studies  D1201,  D2301,  D2309,  and  D2302)  except  for study  1201,  where  the 
benefit was not clearly demonstrated in the defined current and proposed SmPC populations.  
The applicant as well performed subgroup analyses, where 4 subgroups were defined according to the 
different examinations that triggered the treatment: 1) Imaging AND clinical features, 2) Imaging OR 
clinical features, 3) Imaging AND NO clinical features, 4) NO imaging AND WITH clinical features. 
For the pooled studies D2301 + D2309, the analysis indicates that patients with both imaging AND clinical 
features are likely to have more active disease than those who have either imaging OR clinical features. 
The ARR ratio was similar for both subgroups. The results further indicate that, within these studies, there 
was  no  advantage  with  fingolimod 0.5  mg  over  placebo  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  NO  imaging 
activity AND WITH clinical features within the 6 month preceding start of trial medication. These patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 32/66 
 
 
 
 
 
also  had  the  lowest  absolute  risk  of  clinical  relapses.  For  those  patients  with  only  imaging  features 
(defined as subjects having Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline) the absolute risk of relapse was highest 
and the ARR was 0.11 on fingolimod compared with 0.46 on placebo, showing a relative reduction with 
75.4 % (p=0.0003). These results indicate that imaging activity without clinical activity had a higher risk 
of  relapse  than  those  without  imaging  activity,  and  the  greatest  relative  effect  of  fingolimod  was 
registered in this group.  
In  study  D2302  there  was  only  a  slight  increase  of  ARR  in  those  with  imaging  AND  clinical  features 
compared  to  those  with  imaging  OR  clinical  features.  Again,  for  this  subgroup  with  imaging  AND  NO 
clinical features, the effect size was larger than for those with NO imaging AND WITH clinical features, in 
analogy with the results for pooled studies D2301+D2309. Efficacy in those with clinical features AND NO 
imaging activity was of borderline significance over beta interferon. 
For patients switching from Interferon to Gilenya in extension study D2302/D2302E1), the reduction in 
ARR was consistent across 3 subgroups (Imaging AND clinical features, Imaging OR clinical features, NO 
imaging AND WITH clinical features).  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The criteria for diagnosis of MS have been updated in 2001, 2005 and 2010. During recent years more 
emphasis has been put on the role of MRI and how MRI can measure disease activity in order to reach a 
diagnosis of MS. In a previous version of the criteria for MS diagnosis, reference was made to a specific 
number of 9 T2 hyperintense brain lesions; however this reference has been removed in the 2010 revision 
of the McDonald criteria. This reference can be considered outdated and it should be removed from the 
indication text.  
To support the current variation application, the applicant has performed post-hoc analyses of data from 
previously  conducted  clinical  studies  with  fingolimod.  The  applicant  compared  the  ARR  in  the  overall 
population and in subgroups defined according to the currently approved indication and the new proposed 
indication. Additional supportive post-hoc analyses were also performed. The results for the subgroups 
defined according to the current SmPC and the proposed SmPC indicated that patients with both imaging 
and clinical features are likely to have more active disease than those who have either imaging or clinical 
features.  The  positive  results  from  the  performed  analyses  in  the  subgroups  confirm  the  efficacy  of 
fingolimod  in  the  intended  population  after  the  extension  of  indication  which,  as  mentioned  above, 
overlaps a great deal with the population covered in the current wording of the indication. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current application seeks a modification to the Gilenya indication, to include patients with active MS 
disease defined by clinical or imaging features despite treatment with at least 1 DMT. To support the 
proposed change, the current submission presents the results of post-hoc analyses of safety data from all 
4 completed, randomized, double-blind, controlled studies within the fingolimod Phase 2 and 3 clinical 
development programs which explored the fingolimod 0.5 mg dose for at least 6 months. Integrated 
long-term safety information is provided from the aforementioned core studies and from open-label 
extension studies. Safety data for the proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and current 
SmPC subpopulation was compared.

2.4.1.  Safety analysis 
•  Evaluation of SmPC subpopulations (Group D and Group F analyses) 
The key safety analyses for this submission are based on the following datasets: 
•  Group  D  Pooled  data  from  3  placebo-controlled  core  studies  D1201,  D2301,  D2309  and 
active-controlled study D2302. For study D2302 only fingolimod data was included. These studies 
provided a pooled dataset (Group D) of 3818 patients from completed, randomized, controlled, 
double-blind  studies  of  at  least  6  months  duration  which  tested  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
fingolimod 0.5 mg. An overview of the 4 controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies contributing to the 
post-hoc safety analyses is provided in Table 1-1 below. 
•  Group F Pooled integrated data from core and extension studies D1201, D2301, D2302, D2309, 
D1201E1,  D2301E1,  D2302E1,  D2309E1,  2399E1,  and  D2399  (Study  D2399  only  contains 
patients from the 4 Group D core studies) that comprised 3458 patients. Only patients who had 
participated in the core studies and had fingolimod exposure will be included in the long-term 
safety analysis (Table 1-2).

The consistency of safety was evaluated by the MAH for the overall safety population, and for the current 
and proposed SmPC subpopulations (Table 1-4), based on pooled study data (Table 1-3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015

From the pooled dataset Group D, 1269 patients received treatment with fingolimod 0.5 mg. The 
SAF-current SmPC population accounted for more than 95% of the SAF-proposed SmPC population in the 
pooled studies of interest (Table 1-5).

Safety analyses (based on a data lock point of 01-Oct-2014) were performed for pooled and individual 
study data using MedDRA 17.0. The safety analysis focuses on adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events (SAEs), from the core phases (Group D) of controlled studies using incidence and exposure 
adjusted incidence rate (IR) of AEs/SAEs. All data for AEs while patients were on study drug and up to 45 
days after the study drug discontinuation were included. For analyses in Group D, all data available in the 
clinical database for SAEs were included regardless of the 45-day cutoff, but excluding those after the first 
dose of an extension study if patients continued in an extension. For analyses in Group F, all data 
available in the clinical database for SAEs were included regardless of extension. All important identified 
and potential risk definitions were based on predefined risk search criteria. Level 1 corresponds to the 
overarching risk search term, which may have MedDRA substructures or NMQs (Level 2, 3, 4 or 5). These 
NMQs levels follow the same rules as SMQ levels. The priority focus of the safety information was the 
analysis of AEs of fingolimod in pooled core Studies D1201, D2301, D2302, D2309, and specifically the 
AEs classified as 'important identified risks' or 'important potential risks. 
Patient disposition was summarized for all randomized patients in Group D and the safety set in Group F. 
MS disease baseline characteristics (including MS history) were summarized by treatment using

frequency distributions (for categorical variables) and summary statistics (for continuous variables) using 
the randomized set in Group D only. 
•  Evaluation of subgroups based on imaging/clinical features 
Additional supportive analyses, in which patients were allocated to 4 subgroups based on imaging and/or 
clinical features at baseline, were performed using the following studies: 
- 
- 
 Patients from pooled placebo-controlled Studies D2301 and D2309, and active-controlled study 
D2302 who were previously treated with DMT within 1 year prior to treatment initiation. 
Patients switching from IFN-β1a in core study D2302 to fingolimod 0.5 mg in extension study 
D2302E1 
For safety, only the “imaging AND clinical features” and “imaging OR clinical features” subgroups are 
provided for the AE/SAE safety analyses for comparison. It should be noted that the “imaging OR clinical 
features” subgroup is pooled from the 2 subgroups which represent the opposite ends of the subgroup 
definition: “imaging AND NO clinical features” and “NO imaging AND WITH clinical features.” Since the 
safety analysis focuses on comparison of patients under the current and proposed label, only the 2 
subgroups that most closely matched these populations were analyzed. However, results are available 
from all 4 subgroups, for exposure, demographics, disposition, baseline MS disease history and baseline 
MS disease characteristics. 
The additional safety information mentioned above from subgroup analyses of patients based on clinical 
and/or imaging features is included for completeness. For the safety results however, it needs to be taken 
into consideration that these are being based on a small number of patients and at the same time explore 
a high number of endpoints (ie different preferred terms), each with a relatively low frequency of 
occurrence. This multiplicity of events assessed in conjunction with the low within subgroup incidence 
rates increases the risk of chance findings.

2.4.2.  Patient exposure 
•  Exposure to treatment 
Exposure is defined as the sum of days spent in study minus the sum of days of all treatment interruptions 
irrespective of the identity and dose of the treatment medication. Patient-years are defined as the sum of 
the number of days on study drug for all patients in the group divided by 365.25. Exposure data is 
presented for Group D SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC (Table 1-9) and Group F 
SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC (Table 1-10). 
•  Exposure in controlled studies (Group D analysis) 
Duration of exposure was similar between fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo in the individual studies. 
The mean duration of exposure was to some degree higher in the placebo arm compared to the fingolimod 
0.5 mg arm for both the SAF proposed SmPC (488.2 days in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm and 540.5 days 
in the placebo arm) and the SAF current SmPC (486.2 days in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm and 536.2 days 
in the placebo arm). Since the 1 year Study D2302 was included only in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm, there 
was a higher percentage of patients receiving treatment for ≥2 years in the placebo arm for both the 
SAF-proposed SmPC and the SAF-current SmPC (45.3% and 44.3%, respectively) when compared to the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg arm (27.6% and 27.3%, respectively). The median duration of exposure was higher 
for patients on placebo compared to the patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg for both the SAF-proposed SmPC 
(379.0 days in the fingolimod 0.5 mg and 710.0 days in the placebo), and the 
SAF-current SmPC (378.0 days in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm and 708.5 days in the placebo arm). The 
differences in median duration of exposure between fingolimod 0.5 mg and the placebo reflects the 
inclusion of Study D2302 for which only the patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg are included, while the patients 
treated with the active comparator IFN-β1a are not. 
Since Study D2302 was only 1 year in duration, the median duration of exposure was noticeably 
impacted, while the mean duration of overall exposure decreased only to a minor degree (see Table 1-9). 
Exposure adjusted AE incidence rates were provided in addition to AE incidence to allow further 
comparison, as needed.

•  Exposure in the long-term safety population (Group F analysis) 
The durations of study drug exposure to fingolimod 0.5 mg in the Group F analysis for both the 
SAF-proposed SmPC and the SAF-current SmPC reflect the increased long-term safety study durations 
(Table 1-2) and allow for valid comparisons of safety. 
The median duration of exposure was similar in the patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg for both the 
SAF-proposed SmPC (1358.0 days), and the SAF-current SmPC (1358.5 days; Table 1- 10). The mean 
study drug exposure for patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg was also similar between the SAF-proposed SmPC 
and the SAF-current SmPC. There was no meaningful difference between the PTYs of exposure in the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg arm for both the SAF-proposed SmPC (3342.6 PTYs) and the SAF-current SmPC 
(3277.7 PTYs). 
Duration of actual exposure to study medication by administered study drug and dose for individual 
studies is presented in Table 1-10.

•  Exposure in subgroups based on imaging/clinical features 
o  Exposure in pooled D2301+D2309 studies 
The mean exposure was similar among all 4 subgroups. The number of PTYs varied proportionally with the 
number of patients in each of the 4 subgroups. For complete exposure data see [SCS-Appendix 1-Table 
S2.6-1.1a to Table S2.6-1.1d]. 
o  Exposure in Study D2302 
The mean exposure was similar among all 4 subgroups. The number of PTYs varied proportionally with the 
number of patients in each of the 4 subgroups. For complete exposure data see [SCS-Appendix 1-Table 
S2.6-1.2a to Table S2.6-1.2d]. 
o  Exposure in D2302/D2302E1 
The mean exposure was similar among all 4 subpopulations. The number of PTYs varied proportionally 
with the number of patients in each of the 4 subgroups. For complete exposure data see [SCS-Appendix 
1-Table S3.6-1.1a to Table S3.6-1.1d]. 
•  Post-marketing exposure 
Combining the exposure information from MS clinical trials and sales information, it is conservatively 
estimated that approximately 104 757 MS patients have been exposed to fingolimod for a total of 
approximately 175 217 patient years (DSUR-FTY720-001 (Issue 4)).

“erythema” in the SAF-proposed SmPC subpopulation appeared to be twice the incidence in the 
SAF-current SmPC subpopulation: 0.5% (n=3) versus 0.2% (n=1) respectively. 
The most common AEs (≥5% incidence) observed in the SAF were consistent with the known safety 
profile of fingolimod. In addition the incidences of the most common AEs did not show any relevant 
differences (of ≥1%) between the subpopulations.  This is expected given the substantial patient overlap 
between the SmPC subpopulations. 
•  Adverse events in imaging/clinical subgroups  
Pooled studies D2301+D2309 
In the fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment group, some numeric differences in incidences were observed 
between the 2 subgroups of interest. However, there was no clear association between higher incidences 
and one particular subgroup, and it is concluded by the MAH that these variations are due to small sample 
sizes and random variation.

Study D2302/D2302E1 
Some differences in types of AEs and incidences were observed between the 2 subgroups of interest. 
However, based on the small sample sizes, it is expected that variations were due to random variation 
according to the MAH. 
2.4.3.2.  Adverse events of special interest 
The  safety  profile  of  fingolimod  was  also  assessed  based  on  the  following  AE  risk  terms  listed  as 
“important identified risks” or “important potential risks” in the current RMP [EU RMP version 8.1]: 
•  Bradyarrhythmia 
•  Hypertension 
• 
Liver transaminase elevation 
•  Macular edema 
• 
• 
Infections 
Leucopenia and lymphopenia 
•  Reproductive toxicity 
•  Bronchoconstriction 
•  Hypersensitivity 
•  Skin cancer 
•  Other malignant neoplasms 
• 
Thromboembolic events 
•  QT interval prolongation 
•  Convulsions 
•  Herpes zoster / varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
•  Herpes viral infections other than VZV 
• 
Pulmonary edema 
•  Decreased renal function 
Bradyarrhythmia 
For Level 1 term ‘bradyarrhythmia’, the IR in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the core studies were similar 
for both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations. In both SmPC subpopulations the IRs of 
bradyarrhythmia were marginally higher for the fingolimod 0.5 mg as compared to the placebo groups 
(11.4 (n=86) versus 10.6 (n=52) ( IRR of 1.08) in the proposed-SmPC subpopulation; and 11.0 (n=82) 
versus 11.0 (n=52) (IRR of 1.01) in the current-SmPC subpopulation. 
In the core studies, IRs and IRRs for Level 1 terms were comparable across the 2 SmPC subpopulations. 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in core studies had a higher IR of 
bradyarrhythmia than placebo patients: 10.4 (n=167) versus 9.4 (n=113), respectively, resulting in an 
IRR of 1.10 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). This IR is dominated by occurrence after fingolimod 
treatment initiation. Thus, the bradyarrhythmia IR in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group decreased with longer 
exposure, from 10.4 (n=167) to 4.4 (n=282) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). 
No meaningful differences in IRs were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis).

Hypertension 
For the Level 1 term ‘hypertension’, and its Level 2 terms, the IRs in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the 
core studies were comparable for both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations (5.0 
(n=41) and 5.1 (n=41), respectively). The IRs with fingolimod 0.5 mg were higher than with placebo: 5.0 
(n=41) versus 2.4 (n=13) in the SAF-proposed SmPC and 5.1 (n=41) versus 2.3 (n=12) in the 
SAF-current SmPC subpopulation. The apparently lower IRR versus placebo in the SAF-proposed SmPC 
subpopulation was due to a difference in the number of events in the placebo group; the number of Level 
1 events in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group was the same in both SmPC subpopulations. 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a higher IR of 
hypertension than placebo patients: 5.4 (n=94) versus 2.8 (n=36), respectively, (IRR of 1.96) (SAF, 
Group D analysis, Level 1 term). 
For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR decreased with longer exposure (from 5.4 (n=94) to 3.4 (n=231), IRR 
0.63) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC groups over longer exposure durations 
(Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Liver transaminase elevation 
For the Level 1 term ‘liver transaminase elevation’, the IRs of fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies were 
comparable for both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations (10.9 (n=86) versus 11.0 
(n=85)). The IRRs in fingolimod versus placebo in the core studies were comparable in the SAF-proposed 
subpopulation and the SAF-current SmPC subpopulation: 2.77 versus 2.72, respectively. This was also 
the case for the Level 2 terms (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a higher IR of liver 
transaminase elevation than placebo patients: 12.8 (n=211) versus 3.8 (n=50) (IRR of 3.36) (SAF, 
Group D analysis, Level 1 term). 
For fingolimod 0.5 mg the IR decreased with long term exposure, from 12.8 (n=211) to 5.5 (n=356), IRR 
0.43 (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). These results are in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP 
version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Macular edema 
Patients in the MS program underwent mandatory special assessments that included frequent 
examinations by an ophthalmologist including eye history, visual acuity, and dilated ophthalmoscopy, 
optical coherence tomography at Screening and end-of-treatment and at any time in case of suspicion of 
macular edema. Medical records of all potential macular edema cases were reviewed by the DSMB 
ophthalmologist, a retinal specialist. In the extension studies, ophthalmological monitoring was not as 
extensive. 
For the term Macular edema, the IR of Level 1 and 2 terms in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the core 
studies were identical in both the SAF-proposed SmPC and the SAF-current SmPC subpopulations: 0.2 
(n=2) and 0.2 (n=2), respectively. An apparent lower IRR versus placebo in the SAF-proposed SmPC 
subpopulation (0.43 versus 0.64) was due to a difference in the number of patients in the placebo group 
in the 2 SmPC subpopulations (n=3 versus n=2). 
For the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a higher IR of macular 
edema than placebo patients, although the IR were low in both groups: 0.3 (n=6) versus 0.2 (n=3) (IRR

of 1.48) (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For the fingolimod 0.5 mg group, the IR showed a slight 
decrease with longer observation, from 0.3 (n=6) to 0.2 (n=12), IRR 0.48 (SAF, Group D versus Group 
F analysis). 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis)  
Infections 
For the Level 1 term ‘infections’, IR and IRRs versus placebo in the core studies were comparable for the 
SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations. This was also the case for the Level 2 terms (Group 
D analysis). 
As part of a previous health authority request related to PSUR, Novartis has been routinely assessing 
cellulitis infections as a subgroup of infections. For the Level 1 term ‘infections (cellulitis)’, the IRs and 
IRRs in fingolimod 0.5 mg versus placebo in the core studies were also comparable for the SAF-proposed 
and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a similar IR of 
infections compared to placebo patients: 93.2 (n=827) versus 96.6 (n=586) (IRR of 0.96) (SAF, Group D 
analysis, Level 1 term). For fingolimod 0.5 mg the IR decreased with longer term exposure, from 93.2 
(n=827) to 66.9 (n=1368) (IRR of 0.72) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). These results are in line 
with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Leukopenia and lymphopenia 
For the Level 1 term ‘leukopenia and lymphopenia’, the IRs for fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies were 
marginally higher in the SAF-proposed subpopulation than in the SAF-current SmPC subpopulation (6.3 
(n=51) versus 6.1 (n=49)). The IRR versus placebo in the core studies was also marginally higher in the 
SAF-proposed subpopulation than in the SAF-current SmPC subpopulation (17.38 versus 16.50). The IRs 
and IRRs for Level 2 terms were also higher in the SAF-proposed subpopulation than in the SAF-current 
SmPC subpopulation (Group D analysis). 
For the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a higher IR of 
leucopenia and lymphopenia than placebo patients: 4.7 (n=82) versus 0.2 (n=3) (IRR 21.02) (SAF, 
Group D analysis, Level 1 term). 
For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR increased with exposure, from (n=82) to 6.4 (n=395) (SAF, Group D versus 
Group F analysis). This is primarily due to the open label nature of the extension studies. In the core 
studies, investigators were blinded and only laboratory values which were lower than the threshold of 200 
cells/mm3 were flagged to the investigator. In the noncontrolled extension studies, the investigators had 
access to laboratory values and were free to exercise medical judgment. 
Leucopenia and lymphopenia are expected pharmacodynamic effects of fingolimod and thus have a 
higher incidence in the fingolimod group as compared to placebo. These results are in line with what is 
discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Bronchoconstriction 
Assessment report

For Level 1 term ‘asthma/bronchospasm’, IRs and IRRs for fingolimod 0.5 mg versus placebo in the core 
studies were comparable for the SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations. This was 
also the case for Level 2 terms (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a similar IR of 
asthma/bronchospasm to placebo: 1.5 (n=27) versus 1.6 (n=21), respectively, (IRR of 0.95) (SAF, 
Group D analysis, Level 1 term), The IR in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group remained stable, with a tendency 
to decrease (from 1.5 (n=27) to 1.1 (n=77)) with longer exposure (SAF, Group D versus Group F 
comparison).  
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Hypersensitivity 
For the Level 1 term of hypersensitivity there were no apparent differences in IR between patients on 
fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo for both the SAF-proposed (10.6 (n=82) versus 13.3 (n=65)) and 
SAF-current (10.6 (n=80) versus 13.5 (n=64)) subpopulations. 
In the overall SAF population, there was no difference in IR and IRR (0.80 for SAF-proposed versus 0.78 
for SAF-current). There was no difference in the IRR between the Group D and F analyses for both SmPC 
subpopulations (10.6 (n=82) versus 5.7 (n=168) for SAF-proposed and 10.6 (n=80) versus 5.5 (n=161) 
for SAF-current). The results from the Group D versus Group F analysis align with what is observed in [EU 
RMP version 8.1]. 
Reproductive toxicity 
For the Level 1 risk search term ‘pregnancy and neonatal topics (SMQ) (broad)’ and its associated Level 
2 terms, the IRs and IRRs for fingolimod 0.5 mg versus placebo in the core studies were comparable in the 
SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis) 
For the overall SAF, the IR of pregnancy and neonatal topics (SMQ) (broad) in the core studies was 1.2 
(n=21) in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group and 1.9 (n=25) in the placebo group, (IRR of 0.62) (SAF, Group 
D analysis, Level 1 grouped terms. For fingolimod 0.5 mg the IR remained stable or decreased (from 1.2 
(n=21) to 0.8 (n=61), IRR 0.71) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). 
These results are in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis) 
Skin cancer 
For the Level 1 term 'skin cancer', the IRs in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the core studies were similar 
for both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations). Inboth subpopulations the IRs were 
marginally lower for the fingolimod 0.5 mg as compared to the placebo group (3.1 (n=26) versus 3.5 
(n=19)and 3.0 (n=25) and 3.6 (n=19), respectively), resulting in an IRR of <1 in both SmPC 
subpopulations (0.88 and 0.83 respectively). 
Overall, the IRs and IRRs for Level 1 and 2 terms were similar in the proposed-SmPC subpopulation and 
the current-SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis, Table 2-23), with only the IRR for the Level 2 term 
Skin premalignant disorders (SMQ) being numerically slightly higher in the proposed-SmPC 
subpopulation than in the current-SmPC subpopulation (0.74 versus 0.68, respectively). 
In the overall SAF however, the IR for fingolimod 0.5 mg was higher as compared with placebo (3.0 
(n=54) versus 2.2 (n=29) respectively), resulting in an IRR of 1.38 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 
term). This is in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
Assessment report

No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer 
exposure durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Other malignant neoplasms 
For the Level 1 term ‘other malignant neoplasms’ and its associated Level 2 terms, the IRs and IRRs 
versus placebo in the core studies were similar in the SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC 
subpopulations (Group D analysis). This was also the case for the Level 1 term ‘malignant neoplasms 
(cervical cancer)’ and its Level 2 terms (Group D analysis). 
For the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a similar IR to placebo 
patients: 1.5 (n=28) versus 1.3 (n=18) (IRR of 1.15) (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR was stable or reduced with longer exposure (from 1.5 (n=28) to 1.1 (n=81), 
IRR 0.71) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). The IR of other malignant neoplasms (cervical cancer) 
in the core studies were 0.3 (n=5) for patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg versus 0.1 (n=2) in the 
placebo group, IRR 1.85 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term. For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR was stable 
or reduced with longer exposure (from 0.3 (n=5) to 0.1 (n=9), IRR 0.44) (SAF, Group D versus Group F 
analysis). 
QT interval prolongation 
For the Level 1 term ‘Torsade de pointes/QT interval prolongation’ the IRs and IRRs for fingolimod 0.5 mg 
versus placebo in the core studies was similar for the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations. 
This was also the case for the Level 2 terms (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, the IRs for the Level 1 term in the core studies were comparable in the fingolimod 0.5 
mg and placebo groups (1.3 (n=23) versus 1.1 (n=15), respectively, IRR 1.13) (SAF, Group D analysis, 
Level 1 term). The IR in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group decreased with longer exposure: from 1.3 (n=23) 
to 
0.6 (n=48), IRR 0.51 (SAF Group D versus Group F comparison). This reduction is understandable as QTc 
prolongation was most often observed in the context of the first-dose observation. These results are in 
line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Thrombo-embolic events 
For the Level 1 term ‘thromboembolic events’, the IRs for the fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies were 
comparable for both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations; the IRRs versus placebo in 
the core studies were 1.08 and 1.20, respectively. 
For the Level 2 term embolic and thromboembolic events (SMQ), the IRR versus placebo was lower in the 
proposed-SmPC subpopulation than in the current-SmPC subpopulation (0.81 versus 1.07, respectively). 
The IRRs for the other Level 2 terms were similar for the 2 SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a lower IR of 
thromboembolic events than with placebo: 1.0 (n=18) versus 1.7 (n=22) respectively (IRR of 0.60) (SAF, 
Group D analysis, Level 1 term).  
For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with a tendency to decrease with longer exposure, from 1.0 
(n=18) to 0.8 (n=59), IRR 0.80 (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). No meaningful differences were 
observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure durations (Group D versus Group F 
analysis. 
Assessment report

For the Level 1 term ‘thrombo-embolic events (all stroke)’, the IRs in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the 
core studies were similarly low: 0.1 (n=1) in both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations; 
IRR versus placebo was not calculated since no events were reported in the placebo group . This was also 
the case for the Level 2 terms. In the overall SAF, the IR for fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo were both 0.1 
(n=1 and n=2, respectively), with an IRR of 0.37 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For fingolimod 
0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with longer exposure (0.1 (n=1) versus 0.1 (n=9), IRR 2.18 (SAF, Group 
D versus Group F analysis). No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations 
over longer exposure durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
For the Level 1 term ‘thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction)’, the IRs and IRRs in the fingolimod 
0.5 mg group in the core studies versus placebo were comparable in the proposed-SmPC and 
current-SmPC subpopulations. The IRs for Level 1 and 2 terms for myocardial infarction were comparable 
for the 2 SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis). For the overall SAF, the IRs in the core studies were 
low: 0.4 (n=8) in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group versus 0.8 (n=11) in the placebo group, with an IRR of 
0.54 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term).For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with longer 
exposure (0.4 (n=8) versus 0.2 (n=16), IRR 0.48 (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis) 
Convulsions 
For Level 1 term ‘convulsions (SMQ) (Broad)’, the IRs with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies were 
comparable in both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulation (0.6 (n=5) versus 0.5 (n=4)). 
In both SmPC subpopulations the IRs of convulsions in the core studies were higher for the fingolimod 0.5 
mg group compared to the placebo group, but the actual incidences were low: 0.6 (n=5) versus 0.2 
(n=1), (IRR of 3.24) in the proposed-SmPC subpopulation; and 0.5 (n=4) versus 0.2 (n=1), (IRR of 2.57) 
in the current-SmPC subpopulation. This difference in IRR is attributed to a difference of one additional 
patient with convulsions in the proposed SmPC subpopulation. 
In the core studies, IRs and IRRs for Level 2 terms were comparable across the 2 SmPC subpopulations, 
except the IR for Level 2 term convulsions (PT) which was higher in the proposed-SmPC subpopulation 
versus the current-SmPC subpopulation (0.4 versus 0.2). This is attributed to a difference of just 1 
patient with PT of convulsions between the groups. 
In the overall SAF, the IRs of Level 1 term convulsions in the core studies were low in both groups, but 
higher in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group than in placebo patients: 0.4 versus 0.1 respectively (IRR of 2.59) 
(SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR did not show any meaningful change 
with longer exposure (from 0.4 to 0.3, IRR of 0.80) (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). These results 
are in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences in IRs were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis. 
Herpes zoster 
For the Level 1 term ‘herpes zoster infections’, the IRs and IRRs versus placebo in the core studies were 
comparable for the SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations. This was also the case for the 
Level 2 terms (Group D analysis). In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core 
studies had a higher IR of herpes zoster infections than placebo patients: (n=19) versus 0.5 (n=7) (IRR 
2.01) (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with longer 
exposure (1.1 (n=19) versus 1.1 (n=78), IRR 1.02 (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis. No meaningful

versus Group F analysis) 
For the Level 1 term ‘herpes zoster without dissemination’, the IRs and IRR versus placebo in the core 
studies were comparable for the SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC subpopulations. This was also the 
case for the Level 2 terms (Group D analysis,). In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg 
in core studies had a higher IR of Herpes zoster without dissemination than placebo patients: (n=19) 
versus 0.5 (n=7), respectively, resulting in an IRR of 2.01 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term). For 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with longer exposure (1.1 (n=19) versus 1.1 (n=77), 
incidence rate ratio 1.00 (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis. For the Level 1 term ‘herpes zoster 
disseminated’, 2 cases were reported in the fingolimod 1.25 mg group in the core studies (SAF, Group D 
analysis, Level 1 term) and 1 case was reported in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the extension studies 
(SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). 
The results for herpes zoster infections are in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
Herpes viral infections other than VZV 
For the Level 1 term ‘herpes viral infections other than VZV’, the IRs and IRRs fingolimod 0.5 mg versus 
placebo in the core studies were comparable for the SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC 
subpopulations. This was also the case for the Level 2 terms (Group D Analysis. For the SAF, patients 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies did not show any meaningful difference in IR of the 
Level 1 term ‘herpes viral infections other than VZV’ when compared to placebo patients: 3.3 (n=59) 
versus 3.7 (n=49), IRR 0.89. This was also the case for the Level 2 terms (SAF, Group D analysis); 
For patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the SAF Group D versus Group F analysis, the IR tended to 
decrease with longer exposure (from 3.3 (n=59) to 2.6 (n=177), IRR 0.77. The results for the SAF are in 
line with what is discussed in [EU RMP version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences in IRs were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
Decreased renal function 
Decreased renal function had been added as an important potential risk to the RMP based on renal 
transplant studies with fingolimod. The MAH considers that this potential risk has not been confirmed in 
MS patients and that there is no increased risk of renal dysfunction in patients treated with fingolimod. 
Most cases of “decreased renal function” in MS patients are nonserious and asymptomatic changes in 
laboratory parameters. Symptomatic cases are confounded by pre-existing comorbidities and/or acute 
illnesses. 
Given the lack of clinical relevance of the reported cases and no change in the characterization of this risk 
over time, the MAH proposed to remove decreased renal function as an important potential risk from the 
RMP and continue to monitor with routine pharmacovigilance activities. However, decreased renal 
function was still included in the search criteria at the time of data cutoff for this submission, and is 
presented here for completeness. 
For Level 1 term ‘decreased renal function’, the IRs in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the core studies 
were 0.4 (n=3) in both the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC subpopulations. In both SmPC 
subpopulations the IR of decreased renal function in the core studies was marginally higher for the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg as compared to the placebo groups (0.4 (n=3) versus 0.2 (n=1), (IRR 1.94) in the 
proposed-SmPC subpopulation; and 0.4 (n=3) versus 0.2 (n=1), (IRR 1.92) in the current-SmPC 
subpopulation.

In the core studies, IRs and IRRs for Level 2 terms were similar for the proposed-SmPC and current-SmPC 
subpopulations. 
For the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a higher IR of 
decreased renal function than placebo patients, although the overall rates were low in both groups: 0.3 
(n=6) versus 0.1 (n=1) (IRR 4.44), (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 term.For fingolimod 0.5 mg, the 
incidence rate was stable or lower with extended exposure (from 0.3 (n=6) to 0.2 (n=17), (IRR 0.69) 
(SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis) . 
No meaningful differences in IRs were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F 
Pulmonary edema 
For the Level 1 term ‘pulmonary edema’ and its associated Level 2 terms, the IRs and IRRs for fingolimod 
0.5 mg group in the core studies, versus placebo, were similar in the SAF-proposed and SAF-current 
SmPC subpopulations (Group D analysis). 
In the overall SAF, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core studies had a similar IR of 
pulmonary edema to placebo patients, and the overall rates were low in both groups: 0.2 
(n=3) versus 0.1 (n=2) respectively, IRR 1.11 (SAF, Group D analysis, Level 1 grouped terms). For 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, the IR remained stable with longer exposure (0.2 (n=3) versus 0.1 (n=4), IRR 0.32) 
(SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). These results are in line with what is discussed in [EU RMP 
version 8.1]. 
No meaningful differences were observed between the SmPC subpopulations over longer exposure 
durations (Group D versus Group F analysis). 
2.4.4.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
•  Deaths in completed studies 
Across the studies, SAEs (including deaths) were required to be reported from the time the patient 
provided informed consent until up to 3 months after the patient stopped participating in the study. 
Deaths which occurred after this period were reported to Novartis at the discretion of the investigator. 
SAEs, including deaths that were reported to Novartis were recorded in the Drug Safety database 
(ARGUS) irrespective of protocol requirements. 
•  Deaths in ongoing studies 
Study D2399 is the only ongoing study in this submission. Deaths for this study were reported in [PSUR 
7] and the annual interim analysis report for this study. 
•  Other serious adverse events 
The overall profile of SAEs in the pooled studies was consistent with that previously observed. 
Overall, 10.4% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg and 12.5% of placebo patients experienced 
SAEs during the core studies D1201, D2301, D2302 and D2309 (SAF, Group D analysis). 
In the core studies, the incidence of individual PTs in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group showed no meaningful 
differences between the current- and proposed-SmPC subpopulations: all PTs were below 1%, with the 
exception of basal cell carcinoma, which had an incidence of 1.2% in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group in the 
current-SmPC subpopulation and 1.1% in the proposed-SmPC subpopulation (Group D analysis. 
Based on exposure adjusted incidence rates, the SAE profile for the fingolimod 0.5 mg group did not show 
any meaningful differences with longer exposure: the incidence rates for the majority of SAE PTs

remained stable or decreased. As would be expected, some SAEs were reported in the long-term 
extension studies which had not been observed previously in the core studies. However, in each case, the 
incidence rate change was from 0 to 0.1% (SAF, Group D versus Group F analysis). This was also the case 
for both the current and proposed SmPC subpopulations, and no meaningful differences were observed 
between the 2 subpopulations (Group D versus Group F analysis) 
Serious adverse events based on identified and potential risks are presented for core and long-term 
studies. Group D and Group F comparisons are presented for identified and potential risks that could be 
impacted by duration of treatment or time. Since the composition of the SAF-proposed SmPC and 
SAF-current SmPC populations were similar no major differences in SAEs were expected. 
Bradyarrhythmia 
Patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in core studies had a higher incidence rate of bradyarrhythmia 
SAEs than patients treated with placebo in both the SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC. The IRs 
and IRR for Level 1 and 2 terms were identical for the SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC. 
In the overall SAF-population, the IR was higher for patients taking fingolimod compared to placebo. No 
meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between the SmPC groups in the comparison of core 
and long-term studies. 
Bronchoconstriction 
Patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg in core studies had a similarly low incidence rate of 
bronchoconstriction (asthma/bronchospasm) in both the SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC 
subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.1 (n=0) respectively; IRR versus placebo was not calculated 
since none of the patients in the placebo group had SAEs). The IRs and IRR for Level 1 and 2 terms were 
identical for the SAF-proposed SmPC and SAF-current SmPC. 
In the overall SAF-population, the IR was similar for patients taking fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.1 
(n=1) versus IR=0.1 (n=1), respectively; IRR=0.74). No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were 
observed in the core and long-term studies for the overall SAF (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 
(n=1), IRR=0.24), or in each SmPC subpopulation). 
Convulsions 
The IR of SAEs for the risk search term of convulsions was higher in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 
mg compared to placebo in the SAF-proposed SmPC population (0.4 (n=3) versus 0.2 (n=1), IRR=1.94) 
but not in the SAF-current SmPC population (0.2 (n=2) versus 0.2 (n=1), IRR=1.28). 
In the overall SAF-population, the IR was higher for patients taking fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to 
placebo (IR=0.3 (n=5) versus IR=0.1 (n=2), respectively; IRR=1.85). 
The IR of convulsions was marginally lower in the long-term studies compared to core studies in the 
proposed SmPC subpopulation (IR=0.2 (n=7) versus (IR=0.4 (n=3), respectively); however, there was 
no difference between the long term and core studies in the current SmPC subpopulation (IR=0.2 (n=6) 
versus IR=0.2 (n=2). 
There was no meaningful difference between the IRR of SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC 
subpopulations (IRR=0.56 versus 0.72). 
Herpes zoster infections 
The IR for herpes zoster infections similarly low in the SAF-proposed and SAF-current populations in 
Group D (IR=0.1 (n=1) in each SmPC subpopulation); IRR was not calculated since none of the patients 
in the placebo group had SAEs). For the overall SAF population, the IR was higher for patients on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 52/66 
 
 
 
 
 
fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to patients on placebo (IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.0 (n=0), respectively; 
IRR was not calculated since none of the patients in the placebo group had SAEs)). For the Group D and 
Group F comparison, there was no change in the IR and IRRs of herpes zoster infection in the long-term 
studies compared to core studies in the both SAF-proposed and SAF-current populations (IR=0.1 (n=4) 
versus IR=0.1 (n=1); IRR=0.96 in each SmPC subpopulation).  
Herpes viral infections other than VZV 
The IR of SAEs of herpes zoster infections other than VZV was similarly low for both SmPC subpopulations 
(IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=0) in placebo; IRR was not calculated since none of the patients in the 
placebo group had SAEs). For the overall SAF, patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg had a higher IR than patients 
on placebo (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=0), respectively; IRR was not calculated since none of the 
patients in the placebo group had SAEs). 
No meaningful differences were observed in the IR or IRRs in the Group D and Group F analysis in the both 
SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC populations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.1 (n=2); IRR=0.48 in each 
SmPC subpopulation).  
Infections 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of infections were of similarly low incidence in the 
SAF-proposed and SAF-current SmPC populations (IR=1.1 (n=9) versus IR=1.1 (n=6) in placebo; 
IRR=0.97 versus 0.96, respectively). There was no obvious difference in the profile of serious infections 
between the 2 subpopulations. For the overall SAF, patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg had a marginally higher 
IR than patients on placebo (IR=1.1 (n=19) versus IR=0.9 (n=12), respectively; IRR=1.17). No 
meaningful differences in SAEs of infection were observed in the Group D versus Group F comparison 
between the SAF-proposed SmPC and the SAF-current SmPC subpopulations. 
No serious cases of infections (cellulitis) were reported in Group D for both fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo 
in both the SmPC subpopulations and overall SAF. No meaningful differences were observed in SAEs for 
infections (cellulitis) for groups D and F comparison (IR=0.0 (n=0) versus IR=0.0 (n=1), respectively in 
each SmPC subpopulation). 
Hypertension 
There were no SAEs of hypertension reported for the SAF-proposed SmPC or SAF-current SmPC in the 
core studies. This was also the case for the overall SAF in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group. For the Group D 
and F comparison, 2 patients in Group F experienced SAEs of hypertension but the IR remained similarly 
low in both the SAF-proposed and SAF-current population (IR=0.0 (n=1) in each SmPC subpopulation). 
Hypersensitivity 
The IR of hypersensitivity SAEs in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg was marginally lower compared 
to placebo and was the same for both the subpopulations (IR=0.2 (n=2) versus IR=0.4 (n=2), 
respectively in each SmPC subpopulation; IRR=0.65 and 0.64 for SAF proposed and SAF-current SmPC 
subpopulations, respectively). In the overall SAF-population, the IR was the similar for patients taking 
fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.2 (n=3), respectively; IRR=0.49). 
For the Group D and F comparison there were no meaningful differences in IR or IRRs (IR=0.2 (n=2) 
versus IR=0.1 (n=4), IRR=0.48, in each SmPC subpopulation. 
Leukopenia and Lymphopenia 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of leukopenia and lymphopenia were similarly low in 
both SmPC subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=0) in each SmPC subpopulation; IRR was 
not calculated since none of the patients in the placebo group had SAEs). This was the case for overall 
Assessment report

SAF-population (IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.0 (n=0), respectively). No meaningful differences in IRs or 
IRRs were observed between Group D and Group F in both SmPC subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus 
IR=0.1 (n=5), IRR=1.20, in each SmPC subpopulation). 
Liver transaminase elevation 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of liver transaminase elevation were of similarly low 
incidence in both SmPC subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group versus IR=0.0 
(n=0) in the placebo group in each SmPC subpopulation; IRR was not calculated since none of the 
patients in the placebo group had SAEs). In the overall SAF-population, there were no meaningful 
differences in IR between fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo (IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.1 (n=1), 
respectively; IRR=1.48). No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between the Group D 
and Group F in both SmPC subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.1 (n=3), IRR=0.72, in each SmPC 
subpopulation. 
Macular edema 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of macular edema were similar and low in both SmPC 
subpopulations for fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.2 (n=1), respectively; 
IRR=0.65, SAF-proposed and 0.64, SAF-current). In the overall SAF, patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg had 
a similar IR to patients on placebo (IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.1 (n=1); IRR=1.48). No meaningful 
differences in IRs and IRRs were observed between Group D and Group F and between both the SmPC 
subpopulations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=1), IRR=0.24, in each SmPC subpopulation). 
Other malignant neoplasms 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of other malignant neoplasms were similar in both 
SmPC subpopulations with marginally higher IR in the fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo (IR=1.2 
(n=10) versus IR=1.6 (n=9), IRR=0.72, SAF-proposed; IR=1.2 (n=10) versus IR=1.7 (n=9), IRR=0.71, 
SAF-current).  However,  in  the  overall  SAF  population,  there  was  no  meaningful  difference  in  the  IR 
between fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo (IR=1.3 (n=24) versus IR=1.1 (n=15); IRR=1.18). 
No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between Group D and Group F and between both 
SmPC  populations  (IR=1.2  (n=10)  versus  IR=0.9  (n=32),  IRR=0.77,  SAF-proposed;  IR=1.2  (n=10) 
versus IR=0.9 (n=31), IRR=0.75, SAF-current). 
Other malignant neoplasms (cervical cancer) 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of other malignant neoplasms (cervical cancer) were 
of similarly low incidence in both SmPC subpopulations in fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.0 (n=0) 
versus IR=0.2 (n=1), respectively; IRR=0) (Table 2-50). This was also the case with overall SAF 
population (IR=0.0 (n=0) versus IR=0.1 (n=1), respectively; IRR=0). There were no serious cases of 
cervical cancer in the SAF-proposed and SAF-current Group D and Group F comparisons. 
Skin cancer 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of skin cancer were of similarly low incidence in both 
SmPC subpopulations and were similar between fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo (IR=1.2 (n=10) versus 
IR=1.1 (n=6), respectively in each SmPC subpopulation; 
IRR=1.08 for SAF-proposed and 1.07 for SAF-current). For the overall SAF, patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg 
had a higher IR than patients on placebo (IR=1.2 (n=21) versus IR=0.5 (n=7), IRR=2.22). 
No meaningful differences in IRs and IRRs were observed between Group D and Group F and between 
both the SmPC populations (IR=1.2 (n=10) versus IR=0.7 (n=24), IRR=0.58, SAF proposed; IR=1.2 
(n=10) versus IR=0.7 (n=23), IRR=0.55, SAF-current).

Pulmonary edema 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of pulmonary edema were similar and of low incidence 
in both SmPC subpopulations for fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=0); IRR 
was not calculated since none of the patients in the placebo group had SAEs). This was also the case for 
overall SAF population. No meaningful differences in IRs and IRRs were observed between Group D and 
Group F and between both the SmPC subpopulations (IR=0.1 
(n=1) versus IR=0.0 (n=1), IRR=0.24, in each SmPC subpopulation). 
QT interval prolongation 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of QT interval prolongation were similar and low in 
both SmPC subpopulations for fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.2 (n=1), 
respectively; IRR=0.64 in each SmPC subpopulation). In the overall SAF, IRs were similarly low between 
the fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo groups (IR=0.3 (n=5) versus IR=0.2 (n=3), IRR=1.23). No 
meaningful differences in IRs or IRRSs were observed between Group D and Group F and between both 
SmPC populations (IR=0.1 (n=1) versus IR=0.1 (n=4), IRR=0.96, in each SmPC subpopulation). 
Reproductive toxicity 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of pregnancy and neonatal topics (Level 1) were of 
similar and low incidence in both SmPC subpopulations for fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.2 (n=2) 
versus IR=0.4 (n=2), respectively; IRR=0.65 for SAF-proposed and 0.64 for SAF-current) . In the overall 
SAF, IRs were similarly low in the fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo groups (IR=0.2 (n=3) versus IR=0.4 
(n=6), IRR=0.37). No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between Group D and Group 
F in both SmPC populations (IR=0.2 (n=2) versus IR=0.2 (n=7), IRR=0.84, SAF proposed; IR=0.2 (n=2) 
versus IR=0.2 (n=6), IRR=0.72, SAF current). 
Thrombo-embolic events 
Serious adverse events under the risk search term of thrombo-embolic events were of similar and low 
incidence in both SmPC subpopulations for fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.3 (n=3) versus IR=0.2 
(n=1), IRR=1.94, SAF-proposed; IR=0.4 (n=3) versus IR=0.2 (n=1), IRR=1.92 SAF-current). In the 
overall SAF population, the IRs were similarly low (IR=0.2 (n=4) versus IR=0.5 (n=7), IRR=0.42. 
No meaningful differences in IRs or IRRs were observed between Group D and Group F and between both 
SmPC populations (IR=0.3 (n=3) versus IR=0.3 (n=12), IRR=0.97, SAF-proposed; IR=0.4 (n=3) versus 
IR=0.3 (n=12), IRR=0.97, SAF-current). 
Similarly, SAEs under the risk search term of thrombo-embolic events (myocardial infarction) were of low 
incidence both SmPC subpopulations in fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo (IR=0.2 (n=2) versus IR=0.0 (n=0) 
in each SmPC subpopulation; IRR was not calculated since none of the patients in the placebo group had 
SAEs). In the overall SAF population, the IRs were similarly of low incidence IR=0.1 (n=2) versus IR=0.3 
(n=4), IRR=0.37). No meaningful differences in IRs were observed between Group D and Group F, and 
between both SmPC populations (IR=0.2 (n=2) versus IR=0.1 (n=3), IRR=0.36) in each SmPC 
subpopulation. 
Serious adverse events in imaging/clinical subgroups 
• 
Pooled studies D2301/D2309 
In the fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment group, some numeric differences in incidences were observed 
between the 2 subgroups of interest. However, there was no clear association between higher incidences 
and one particular subgroup, and it is concluded by the MAH that these variations are due to small sample 
sizes and random variation.

2.4.9.  Post-marketing experience 
Relevant publications containing important new safety information, a summary of significant findings 
from ongoing clinical studies, and estimated patient exposure and use patterns were provided in Global 
PSUR 7 and PSUR 8 (EUPSUR7).  
2.4.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main results for this submission were adverse events analysis based on safety data from the 
completed randomized controlled studies within the fingolimod phase 2 and 3 clinical development 
programs which explored the fingolimod 0.5 mg dose for at least 6 months. Only study D1201 has not 
been previously submitted for analysis neither in the original MAA nor in the subsequent applications. This 
study provides limited safety information as duration of exposure was 6 months and this study involved 
only 73 patients in the safety analysis set. 
The analysis sets were of sufficient size for comparison of safety in the SAF-proposed SmPC (n=725), and 
FAS-current SmPC (n=710) subpopulations. However the FAS-current SmPC population accounted for 
more than 95% of the SAF-proposed SmPC population in the pooled studies of interest, with a difference 
in size between the new proposed SmPC population and the current one around 2% only, and an overlap 
between both groups.  Therefore analyses by subpopulations subgroups provide a more relevant 
comparison as these subgroups were disjunctive without patients in common. However interpretation of 
results in this case was somewhat limited by the small sample sizes of the different subgroups. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed based on AE/SAE results only. Treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were not presented through this application. This precludes 
an accurate analysis of causal relationship between AEs and study treatments, notably with fingolimod. 
Some minor differences between the SmPC subpopulations were observed, with regards to convulsions, 
hypertension, leucopenia and lymphopenia, macular edema, skin cancer, thromboembolic events, 
however no firm conclusion can be drawn from these results due to the small size groups. 
It should be considered that the strategy to extend the use of Gilenya to a broader population of 
relapsing/remitting MS patients, by relaxing the conditions of eligibility to the treatment, could potentially 
increase the risk to observe ADRs, notably the important risks previously reported with fingolimod.  
Overall, the provided safety data confirmed that the safety profile remained consistent and comparable 
for patients with active MS selected according to the conditions of the proposed label and patients 
selected according to the current SmPC. The safety profile of fingolimod is unchanged for the targeted 
patient population and could be manageable as outlined in the current Risk Management Plan. 
2.4.11.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Post-hoc analyses have shown that the safety profile of Gilenya remains consistent in the two populations 
(current restricted indication and proposed new indication). Overall, no relevant differences were 
observed between the SmPC subpopulations, and the safety profile was consistent with the known safety 
profile of fingolimod.

2.4.12.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP considered that the current RMP (version 8.1) is considered equally applicable to the revised 
target population, and that no specific updates were considered necessary. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
The MAH proposed to update section 4.1 of the SmPC as follows: 
Gilenya  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- 
Patients with high active  disease defined by clinical or imaging features activity despite a 
full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and 
information about washout periods see Sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. 
Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2- 
hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadoliniumenhancing lesion. A “nonresponder” could also 
be  defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as 
compared to the previous year. 
Or 
- 
 Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or 
a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
No update in other sections of SmPC was proposed as well as no change in other annexes. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
As demonstrated in the phase III studies for the initial MAA, a relative reduction of the frequency by 
relapses by approximately 50 % versus placebo was observed in patients with RRMS in one 2-year and 
one 1-year study. Fingolimod also demonstrated a reduction in risk of disability progression relative to 
placebo over 2 years. In a comparative 1-year study against IFN-beta-1a, no statistically significant 
difference was seen for risk of disability progression between fingolimod and IFN-beta-1a. 
The post-hoc analyses of data from previously submitted studies and a newly submitted study (D1201) 
have been performed and the obtained results (see Section 2.3.2.3. ) have confirmed the conclusions on 
the benefits of Gilenya. 
In the pooled data analysis submitted by the applicant, for the new conditions proposed for the broader 
indication a population size difference of only 2% was identified from the original group. The MAH has 
compared the results on ARR between two subgroups corresponding respectively to the current restricted 
indication and to the proposed broader indication and extracted from the overall population of the 4 
studies mentioned. The performed analyses demonstrated the beneficial effects of Gilenya on ARR in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 58/66 
 
 
 
 
 
constructed subgroups of patients defined according to the proposed broader indication. These benefits 
were expressed as a significant percent reduction in ARR in the fingolimod groups compared to placebo 
which was consistent between the sub-groups within the individual studies.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The subgroups of patients with differing disease/imaging activity during the six months preceding 
treatment initiation in the relevant trials were small creating consequent uncertainty about the precision 
of estimates. The absolute risk of relapse within the relevant subgroups included in the proposed formal 
indication has not been defined nor has the absolute benefit of fingolimod within this full scope. Within the 
available data, it is notable that the effect on ARR in the total population was primarily driven by patients 
who had MRI activity, whereas those with only clinical relapses had less reduction of ARR.  
From the presented literature no consensus could be distilled on the definition of treatment failure to first 
line therapies and on the definition of highly active disease as well as the role of MRI imaging in these. An 
increase in T2 lesion load in patients receiving a DMT could indeed represent a suboptimal response to 
DMT as it has been shown for interferon-beta, although no prospective data exist to validate a MRI 
measure of activity as a reliable predictor of a poor response in general. Thus the appropriateness of any 
changes in therapy, based only on MRI imaging without supportive clinical symptoms has not yet been 
established at the level of a therapeutic guideline or consensus and remains a subject of discussion. 
The Committee recognized that clinical and MRI measures can be used in the detection of disease activity 
in RRMS patients receiving DMTs and that by combining these measures, clinicians might be able to more 
accurately predict which patients will need a switch or escalation of treatment.  Their use in the process 
of evaluation of MS patients is supported by the increased use of a new composite outcome measure for 
the ultimate goal of complete remission that is the concept of “no evidence of disease activity”(NEDA - 
integrating relapse rate and disability progression on the clinical side and new or enlarging T2- or contrast 
enhancing lesions on the MRI side) and the currently validated RIO score (scoring system that consists of 
a combination of clinical and MRI parameters to predict suboptimal responders) (Rio and al Mult. Scler., 
2009;15:848-853 and Sormani and al, Mult. Scler., 2013;19:605-612).  
Notwithstanding this, it was also recognized that MRI is capable of detecting the continuous inflammation 
in  MS  patients  which,  even  if  not  clinically  manifesting  itself  as  a  relapse,  is  a  known  feature  of  the 
disease.  Additionally,  the  data  in  literature  suggests  that  MRI  imaging  correlates  with  the  long-term 
outcome (Rudick et al, 2006) and that MS patients show higher recruitment of functional brain areas as 
compared to healthy controls in order to fulfil the same task as measured by functional MRI (Rachbauer 
et al, 2006), indicating the need to compensate for existing, but still subclinical brain damage. The CHMP 
was of the opinion that this suggests that disease activity in MS can lead to brain damage already before 
becoming clinically detectable as sustained disability and that MRI evidence of continuing disease activity 
without  corresponding  clinical  symptoms  could  equally  qualify,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  for  active 
treatment.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects appear similar to effects described so far in the RMP for the approved indication or 
raised in last PSUR8 (EuPSUR7).  
The most relevant effects for the current procedure are described in the effects table below, and include 
notably immunosuppression-related effects. 
With the new wording of the indication, MS patients would probably switch to Gilenya at an earlier time in 
the course of their disease. To be treated at an earlier time by Gilenya could potentially result in the

earlier exposure of patients to the immunosuppressive effects of the drug and the risks associated with 
them. It will also extend the period of fingolimod exposure in general, and thus the occurrence of serious 
adverse events associated with prolonged immunosuppression. These unfavourable effects related to 
immunosuppression are described in the current RMP and most notably include opportunistic infections 
and PML.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties about the unfavourable effects remain similar to those considered for the current population 
treated with fingolimod. In addition, uncertainties were increased with regard to the consequences of a 
potential prolonged immunosuppression further to fingolimod exposure. Lastly, uncertainties remain on 
the effect of fingolimod exposure to patients with false positive MRI response.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The demonstrated positive effect of fingolimod on ARR in the evaluated populations represents a clinically 
important benefit as the frequency of relapses is indicative of the activity of the disease and is closely 
related to the accumulation of disability in MS patients. It was recognized that to be treated at an earlier 
time by fingolimod would potentially mean an earlier exposure of patients to the immunosuppressive 
effects of the drug, thus potentially increasing the chances of experiencing the related adverse events. 
Among these, most notably the risk of infections would potentially be increased as exposure increases. 
Nevertheless, in reality, the target population within the new proposed indication will be similar to the 
current indication although is it acknowledged that a switch to fingolimod may occur at an earlier time in 
the natural course of the disease. Thus the safety profile for fingolimod with the new proposed indication 
will not change to any appreciable degree. Fingolimod is and will remain a second line drug and as such 
the CHMP did not consider that the risks associated with fingolimod will fundamentally change given the 
proposed wording of the new indication. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
In  recent  years,  the  treatment  landscape  for  multiple  sclerosis  has  changed  with  the  introduction  of 
several new pharmacological treatments. The monoclonal antibody natalizumab approved in 2006, and 
the  oral  MS  medication  fingolimod  approved in  2011  both  received  a  restricted  second  line  indication 
mainly  due  to  safety  concerns.  A  second  monoclonal  antibody,  alemtuzumab,  approved  in  2013,  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/549382/2015 
Page 61/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
given a broader indication where it was specified that “patients with RRMS with active disease defined by 
clinical OR imaging features” could be treated. The current therapeutic indication for fingolimod in the EU 
is treatment of adult patients with high disease activity, defined by specific clinical (relapse) and imaging 
criteria,  despite  treatment  with  at  least  1  disease  modifying  therapy  (DMT),  or  patients  with  rapidly 
evolving severe RRMS.  
The applicant has proposed to extend the second-line indication, notably, with this modification, 
fingolimod would remain a second-line therapy, with the exception of patients with rapidly evolving MS, 
which remains unchanged.  
To support the presently proposed change in indication, the MAH for Gilenya has submitted the results of 
post-hoc analyses from controlled studies within the fingolimod development program with the aim to 
show that the efficacy and safety of fingolimod remains unchanged under the conditions of the current 
and the proposed definitions for active disease in the SmPC.  
The data on efficacy have confirmed the postulated treatment benefits in both the population covered by 
the current and the proposed new indication. It was recognized that the strategy to extend the use of 
fingolimod to a broader population of relapsing/remitting MS patients, by modifying the conditions of 
eligibility to the treatment, could potentially increase the exposure and have an effect on the safety 
concerns reported with fingolimod. Nevertheless it was concluded that in reality the safety profile of 
fingolimod would not change to any appreciable degree. Taking into account all the above mentioned 
points, the CHMP concluded that the risk-benefit profile of fingolimod in the new extended indication 
remains favourable.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

Extension of Indication to update the Gilenya indication in second line use to ‘Patients with highly 
active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying 
therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see Sections 4.4 and 5.1).’ 
As a consequence, section 4.1 of the SmPC is updated.  
In addition, the applicant took the opportunity to relocate documents from section 5.3.5.1 to 5.3.5.2. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Page 63/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when: 
o treatment is interrupted for one day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
o treatment is interrupted for more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. 
o treatment is interrupted for more than 2 weeks after at least 1 month of treatment. 
o 
Recommendation for overnight monitoring after the first dose (or if the first dose monitoring 
applies during treatment re-initiation) 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of 
findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during monitoring at treatment 
initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first dose monitoring after the second dose of GILENYA. 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of 
findings in patients: 
o With third degree AV block occurring at any time. 
o Where at the 6-hour time point: 
•  Heart rate <45 bpm. 
•  New onset second degree or higher AV block. 
•  QTc interval ≥500 msec. 
That GILENYA is not recommended in patients with: 
o Second degree Mobitz Type II or higher AV block 
o Sick-sinus syndrome 
o Sino-atrial heart block 
o QTc prolongation >470 msec (females) or >450 msec (males) 
o Ischaemic cardiac disease including angina pectoris 
o Cerebrovascular disease 
o History of myocardial infarction 
o Congestive heart failure 
o History of cardiac arrest 
o Severe sleep apnoea 
o History of symptomatic bradycardia 
o History of recurrent syncope 
o Uncontrolled hypertension 
If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits must outweigh potential 
risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring, at least overnight 
extended monitoring is recommended. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients concomitantly taking Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic 
medicines. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients concomitantly taking medicines which are known to 
decrease the heart rate. If GILENYA treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits 
must outweigh potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to switch to non 
heart-rate-lowering therapy or, if not possible, to determine appropriate monitoring. At least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended. 
GILENYA reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. There is a need to check the patient’s 
peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) prior to initiation and to monitor during treatment with 
GILENYA. 
GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. Treatment initiation in patients with severe active 
infection should be delayed until the infection is resolved. Suspension of treatment during serious 
infections should be considered. Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive 
therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive immune system effects. For the 
same reason, a decision to use prolonged concomitant treatment with corticosteroids should be 
taken after careful consideration.

That they will have a baseline ECG and blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of 
GILENYA. 
That their heart rate will need to be monitored for 6 or more hours after the first dose of GILENYA, 
including hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. Patients may be monitored with a continuous 
ECG during the first 6 hours. They will need an ECG at 6 hours and in some circumstances 
monitoring may involve an overnight stay. 
The need to call the doctor in case of treatment interruption as the 1st dose monitoring may need 
to be repeated depending on duration of the interruption and time since start of GILENYA 
treatment. 
The need to report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of GILENYA. 
GILENYA is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or those taking medicines 
concomitantly known to decrease heart rate and they should tell any doctor they see that they are 
being treated with GILENYA.

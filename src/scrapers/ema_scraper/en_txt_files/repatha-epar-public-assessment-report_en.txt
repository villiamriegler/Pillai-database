2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Primary hypercholesterolemia by definition is any hypercholesterolemia which is caused by a disorder 
(either familial- or nonfamilial-) in lipid metabolisms and is not caused secondarily by another reason, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 10/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hyperlipidemia is the heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excess of lipids (ie, 
cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides) in the bloodstream. Hypercholesterolemia, specifically refers to 
the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to genetic 
causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle. Primary 
nonfamilial hyperlipidemia is hyperlipidemia that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, although there 
are polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidemia is generally defined as elevated LDL-C and high 
triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.  
Familial Hyperlipidemia is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum lipid concentrations. 
Among the conditions that comprise familial hyperlipidemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a 
form of inherited hypercholesterolemia characterized by elevated serum LDL-C and the development of 
premature CVD. The overwhelming majority of culprit mutations manifesting in a diagnosis of FH exist 
within the LDL receptor (LDLR), although contributions from the genes for ApoB and for PCSK9 have been 
described. The heterozygous form of this condition (commonly referred to as heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) is estimated to occur between 1:200 and 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C 
levels in affected individuals are significantly elevated, and in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still 
a 2-fold excess of CHD-related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this population. 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is rare (approximately 1/300 000 – 1/million) 
inherited disorder in which very high cholesterol values are seen from childhood on, cardiovascular 
manifestations of CVD appear in early life, and the life expectancy is significantly shortened due to CVD 
manifestations. Several subtypes of the disorder are known, of which in most cases (approximately 95%) 
there is a mutation in LDLR gene. In the remaining cases the mutation is either in ApoB (5%) or in in 
PCSK9 (<0.5%). 
A large body of epidemiological evidence exists demonstrating a strong positive correlation and causal 
relationship between serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the risk of coronary heart 
disease (CHD). Other clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis also appear linked to plasma LDL-C levels 
such as cerebrovascular disease (i.e. stroke) or peripheral vascular disease. In addition, clinical trials 
have shown that LDL lowering therapy with HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors (and possibly ezetimibe) 
reduces risk for CHD. The relationship between LDL-C levels and CHD risk is present over a broad range 
of LDL levels. Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous increasing risk from very low to “normal” and high 
levels of LDL-C. 
A list of interventions to achieve LDL-C control in patients with elevated LDL-C and with high 
cardiovascular risk are available, such as statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. Often however these 
are not sufficiently effective or their use is limited by toxicity. There is an undisputed medical need for new 
effective and well tolerated treatments of lipid disorders. The primary goal of treating lipid disorders is to 
prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with disturbed lipid levels and ideally this 
effect should be demonstrated pre-approval. Nevertheless, for medicinal products acting on LDL-C, at 
least a detrimental effect on mortality and morbidity should be excluded prior to registration (Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
[EMA/CHMP/748108/2013]).  
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) plays a critical role in the 
maintenance of cellular and whole body cholesterol balance by regulating plasma LDL-C levels. It has 
been shown that PCSK9 plays an important role in the recycling and regulation of LDLR (Horton et al, 
2007; Brown and Goldstein, 2006). PCSK9 is a member of the subtilisin family of serine proteases and is 
expressed predominantly in the liver, kidney, and intestine (Zaid et al, 2008). Following secretion, it 
causes post-translational decrease in the expression of hepatic cell surface LDLR by binding it and 
targeting the LDLR for lysosomal destruction. The reduction in hepatic LDLR leads to increased levels of 
Assessment report

Page 11/122 
 
 
 
 
 
circulating LDL-C. Thus, PCSK9 may represent a target for inhibition by novel therapeutics in the 
indications of (1) primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia 
and (2) HoFH. 
Evolocumab is a first in class fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against human 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Evolocumab binds selectively and with high 
affinity to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the LDLR on the liver cell surface, thus 
preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. The inhibition of PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased 
LDLR expression and subsequent decreased circulating concentrations of LDL-C (see Figure 1 below). In 
addition to LDL-C, inhibition of PCSK9 by evolocumab reduce total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), 
non high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non HDL C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL C), 
triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), total cholesterol/HDL C, ApoB/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and 
increase HDL C and ApoA1.  
Figure 1. Mechanism of action for evolocumab 
LDL = low-density lipoprotein; LDL-R = LDL receptor; PCSK9 = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
With its novel mechanism of action, evolocumab could offer an addition to standard of care and available 
therapies in the reduction of LDL-C and improvements in other lipid parameters as a lipid-lowering agent. 
The following indications were approved by the CHMP: 
“Repatha is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet:  
-in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach 
LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or,  
-alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or 
for whom a statin is contra-indicated 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 12/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repatha is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. 
The effect of Repatha on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined.” 
Evolocumab is intended for subcutaneous (SC) administration with either a prefilled syringe (PFS) 
prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen). The dose is either 140 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 420 mg once 
monthly (QM). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of Repatha, evolucumab, is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody (mAb; 
IgG2). Evolocumab specifically binds to human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and 
prevents its interaction with the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The epitope targeted by 
evolocumab spans the interaction domain of PCSK9 with repeat A of the epidermal growth factor 
homology (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR.  
PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation and thereby reduces the liver's ability to 
remove low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the blood. By binding to PCSK9 evolocumab 
inhibits PCSK9 from binding to LDL-receptors and prevents PCSK9-mediated LDL-receptor degradation 
thus resulting in increase of LDL-receptors on the surface of the liver cells and subsequent decreased 
circulating concentrations of LDL-C.  
Evolocumab finished product (140 mg/ml) is formulated in a water for injection solution containing acetic 
acid, proline, polysorbate 80 and sodium hydroxide as excipients. Evolocumab finished product is 
provided in pre-filled syringes (PFS) and auto-injector pens (AI/Pen) for subcutaneous administration.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The general information provided on nomenclature, structure and general properties of the active 
substance, evolocumab, is considered sufficient. The amino acid sequences for the heavy chains (HC) and 
light chains (LC), glycosylation sites at Asn291 on the HCs, disulphide bonds, molecular formulas and 
weights were given. Evolocumab does not involve Fc-region effector functions as a part of its mode of 
action i.e. binding and inhibition of PCSK9. Potentially immunogenic glycans i.e. N-glycoylneuraminic acid 
(NGNA), non-human sialic acid or terminal α-(1-3) galactose were not detected. 
Structure: 
Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody consisting of 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains of the lambda 
subclass. Evolocumab contains 36 total cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and interchain 
disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain contains 441 amino acids with 4 intrachain disulfides. Each light chain 
contains 215 amino acids with 2 intrachain disulfides. Each heavy chain contains an N-linked glycan at a 
consensus glycosylation site on asparagine 291. The theoretical amino acid sequences of evolocumab 
heavy and light chains are provided.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The manufacture of evolocumab active substance represents a conventional monoclonal antibody 
production process (fermentation, recovery, purification and viral inactivation/removal steps). 
The applicant has sufficiently described the outline of the manufacturing process and its control. Flow 
diagrams for the cell culturing process and purification process have been provided, including information 
on operational parameters and in process controls, and lifetime of resins and membranes used.  
The defined criteria for re-processing of selected process steps can be accepted. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
The applicant has provided sufficient information on the compendial and non-compendial materials used 
in the active substance production process. The qualitative composition of the different cell culture media 
used during production is provided. No material of animal or human tissue origin is used.  
Expression construct and cell banking 
The applicant has adequately described the source, history and generation of the cell substrate and cell 
line development. Upon request the applicant also clarified the origin and history of the cell line. 
A two-tiered cell banking system, with a WCB derived from the Master Cell Bank (MCB) has been 
established. The applicant has adequately described the creation of the MCB and WCB, and the procedure 
to establish future WCBs. Identity and purity of the MCB and WCB have been evaluated in line with ICH 
Q5D. No adventitious agents, with the exception of A- and C-type retrovirus-like particles in the MCB, 
were detected. Genetic stability of MCB, WCB, and cells at the limit of in vitro age (LIVCA) was studied. 
The provided results support stability, and demonstrate that product titre and product quality at the 
LIVCA is consistent with other lots produced with lower population doubling levels. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The applicant applied a ranking system from insignificant to severe to assess the criticality of quality 
attributes. The outcome of the severity ranking, which was based on potential impact on patient safety 
(toxicology, immunogenicity) and product efficacy (potency, pharmacokinetics (PK)), is in general 
reasonable. For some quality attributes the applicant provided further justification on request, which was 
accepted.   
Initially, no Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) as such were identified, which complicated the identification 
of critical process parameters (CPPs). All quality attributes that were ranked moderate (5), major (7), or 
severe (9) were classified as CQAs. In addition, criticality assignment of Process Parameters was further 
addressed. All parameters that had statistical significant and practical important effects on CQAs in the 
DOE studies were re-evaluated. Criticality was determined based on the magnitude of this effect, which 
was calculated taken into account the change in the quality attribute caused by the operational parameter 
and the acceptable limits of the quality attribute. The re-evaluation of process parameter criticality is 
considered acceptable. Upon request, limits for some critical process parameters were included for some 
manufacturing steps. 
The critical in-process controls (IPCs) were identified by the applicant. Action or rejection limits were set 
for all IPCs and the actions taken when limits are exceeded were indicated. Upon request, the limits for

some parameters have been tightened. Also, the applicant has provided additional data to demonstrate 
that product-related impurities, which were identified as the main degradation products of evolocumab, 
are appropriately controlled. 
Upon request, the applicant described how future changes to non-critical and critical Process Parameters 
and In Process Controls included in the CTD will be handled during the product life cycle. The applicant 
proposed to report changes to critical PPs and IPCs as Type IB or Type II variation and changes to 
non-critical operational PPs and IPCs as a Type IA variation. The latter was not accepted by default at 
D180 because the applicant should comply with the Variation Regulation. In response, the applicant 
confirmed that changes will be reported in accordance with the Variation Regulation. 
Process validation 
The validation of the evolocumab active substance commercial manufacturing process has been 
performed by producing four consecutive commercial scale batches at the Amgen Rhode Island 
manufacturing site (AML). The process evaluation and verification data demonstrate that the process 
consistently meets its predefined output parameters and that the purification process is capable to reduce 
levels of product and process-related impurities.  Upon request, also information was provided on 
operational performance of the process, demonstrating that it is operated within the limits defined in the 
description of the manufacturing process. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of evolocumab active substance manufactured by the commercial Process (ARI) has 
been performed using state-of-art methods to comprehensively analyse structure, variants and potency. 
The studies have included analysis of primary structure by specifying amino acid sequence, N- and 
C-terminal variants, methionine oxidation, asparagine deamidation and hydroxylysine variants. 
Secondary and tertiary structures were shown to be typical for IgG2 antibodies. Disulfide bond analysis 
identified three types of disulfide isoforms. Further analysis demonstrated that the biological activities of 
these isoforms are comparable to that of the active substance. Evaluation of free sulfhydryl content of 
evolocumab showed low levels of free sulfhydryl typical to antibodies. The charged heterogeneity of 
evolocumab and carbohydrate structures at the N-linked glycosylation site (HC Asn291) have been 
thoroughly characterized. The site is almost fully glycosylated. Deglycosylation had no impact on the 
potency of evolocumab. No O-linked glycosylation was identified, as expected for IgG. Potentially 
immunogenic glycans i.e. N-glycoylneuraminic acid (NGNA), non-human sialic acid or terminal α-(1-3) 
galactose were not detected. The charge heterogeneity of evolocumab has been thoroughly 
characterized, the active substance can be fractioned into three peaks (acidic, main and basic peaks). The 
further fractioned Acidic peak contained deamidated asparagines at evolocumab CDR region having 
multiple sites of deamidation with a minor reduction in potency. The basic region was enriched in high 
molecular weight (HMW) species, methionine oxidation variants, heavy chain C-terminal lysine variants, 
and light chain N-terminal truncated variants, these fractions were fully potent. The detected variability 
can be considered common for antibodies. 
Size heterogeneity of evolocumab was also analysed and the mAb was shown to exist predominantly 
monomeric, with low levels of HMW dimeric forms. Low molecular weight (LMW) structures were 
comprised of LC-LC and LC species. No higher order structures were observed. The antigen specificity of 
evolocumab i.e. binding to the PCSK9 was demonstrated. The functional mechanism of evolocumab does 
not involve Fc effector functions considering PCSK9 being a soluble target, furthermore human IgG2 
isotype is known to have low affinity to FcγRs and C1q therefore having minimal immune effector 
functions. However the binding of evolocumab to FcRn receptor was confirmed using cell-based FcRn 
binding assay.

Specification 
After revision during the evaluation procedure, the active substance specifications are considered 
adequately set and justified.  
Analytical methods 
The descriptions of analytical methods are in general acceptable. 
Data demonstrated proper validation of the assays. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analytical data are provided for all evolocumab active substance lots used during clinical 
development through to process validation at the commercial facility. Each lot was tested to the 
specification in place at the time of lot disposition. The analytical data of active substance manufactured 
by individual processes was consistent suggesting that the processes were under control.  
Reference materials 
The applicant has adequately described the reference standards (RS) used. The primary and working RS 
have been appropriately qualified and characterised with state of art analytical methods. The analysis has 
included the release testing methods and additional characterisation. The results are within the 
specifications. 
Stability of the reference standards is monitored in the ongoing stability program 
Stability 
The stability data support the proposed active substance shelf life at the recommended storage 
temperature. At the recommended storage temperature and at accelerated conditions no trends were 
observed in any of the parameters tested for the duration of the study. 
Post-approval, the applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies and to annually add one 
active substance lot from each manufacturing site to the stability program. The applicant has sufficiently 
justified the testing program. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The applicant has sufficiently described the process changes made during development towards the 
commercial scale manufacturing Process (ARI).  
The applicant evaluated comparability for Process changes. The evaluation consisted of a comparison of 
lot release testing and biochemical, biophysical and biological characteristics.  
Differences were appropriately discussed and give no reason for concern.  
Stressed stability studies showed some differences. At the recommended storage temperature and at 
accelerated conditions no trends were observed in any of the parameters tested. 
In conclusion, the provided data do not indicate the presence of meaningful differences between 
processes, and the nonclinical/clinical data obtained may be used in the benefit risk evaluation.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Composition 
Evolocumab finished product is supplied as a 140 mg/mL formulation in a sterile, single-use, 
preservative-free solution for delivery by subcutaneous injection. 
The finished product is supplied in either a prefilled syringe (PFS) or a prefilled Autoinjector pen (AI/pen), 
which is a disposable, handheld, mechanical (spring-based) injection device that is provided ready-to-use 
and pre-assembled with the same PFS.  
The primary container closure for both presentations consists of a 1 mL Type I glass syringe with a 
staked-in-place stainless steel needle covered with an elastomeric needle shield. For the PFS, a plastic 
plunger rod is threaded into the plunger-stopper. The PFS assembled with the AI/pen does not employ the 
additional outer plastic rigid cover or the plastic plunger rod. 
The devices are not CE marked as they are single integral products at the time of product administration, 
intended exclusively for use in the given combination, and are not reusable.

Pharmaceutical development 
The active substance protein concentration and excipient composition are not modified during 
manufacturing of the finished product. The active substance contains 140 mg/mL formulated evolocumab 
in proline, acetate, polysorbate 80, and is stored at a recommended storage condition of -30°C. 
The excipients chosen for the finished product formulation include proline, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 
80, and sodium hydroxide. Proline was added as both as tonicifier and as viscosity reducing agent. A 
viscosity reducing agent was needed in this formulation due to the high protein concentration, which 
increases viscosity. Acetate was selected for its buffering capacity at the selected pH. Polysorbate 80 was 
added to inhibit soluble and insoluble aggregates of evolocumab in a glass PFS. 
Development of the evolocumab finished product formulation occurred in two stages; initial clinical 
studies and late stage development. Finished product developed for initial clinical studies was supplied as 
a frozen liquid to minimize potential chemical and physical degradation in a 5 mL glass vial consisting of

70 mg/mL evolocumab formulated in acetate, sucrose, polysorbate 20. This formulation has been used 
throughout the preclinical, phase I, phase II and early phase III clinical studies. 
Later stage development targeted a stable, high protein concentration formulation stored as a liquid at 
2°C to 8°C. The evolocumab concentration in the formulation was increased from 70 mg/mL to 140 
mg/mL in proline, acetate, polysorbate 80, (formulation proposed for Marketing Authorisation) 
Device development 
To enhance ease of administration, an Autoinjector/Pen (AI/pen) pre-assembled with the same glass PFS, 
was developed. 
Amgen developed the prefilled Autoinjector/Pen 1.0 (AI/Pen 1.0) and subsequently the prefilled 
Autoinjector/Pen 1.5 (AI/Pen 1.5) on the basis of the existing SureClick® AI/Pen. The AI/Pen version 1.0 
is used throughout the phase 3 clinical studies and is regarded as clinically validated. The AI/pen 1.0 
differs from the SureClick® autoinjector in colour, plunger spring force (increased for the AI/pen due to 
the higher viscosity of evolocumab) and syringe carrier material (provides increased impact resistance for 
the higher spring force). The PFS and AI/Pen are not CE-marked. 
The AI/Pen was further modified as a result of observations during human factors studies, clinical trials 
and design verification studies and designated as AI/pen version 1.5. The final design has been verified 
and validated, but has not been tested in clinical studies. 
The proper functioning of the AI/pen versions 1.0 and 1.5 after long time storage at 2-8 °C has been 
sufficiently validated. The injection time is comparable for both versions of the AI/pen.   
No formula overages are included. The 140 mg/mL PFS is filled to ensure a deliverable volume of 1.0 mL. 
No novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing of evolocumab 
finished product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process 
The finished product manufacturing process has been adequately described. Detailed flow charts and 
descriptions of each unit operation of the manufacturing process were provided for the PFS. In addition, 
process flow diagrams for the assembly, labelling, and packaging of the 140 mg/mL prefilled syringe 
(PFS) and AI/Pen were provided, respectively.  
In addition, for the assembly, labelling, and packaging of the 140 mg/mL PFS as well as the assembly of 
the 140 mg/mL in the AI/pen (rear sub-assembly, front subassembly), the labelling and secondary 
packaging were sufficiently described.  
In-process tests are conducted during the manufacturing process and additional product tests are 
conducted prior to release. Appropriate controls are in place.  
The process validation program included validation of the PFS manufacturing process steps as well as 
filter validation, aseptic process and sterilization validation, environmental monitoring validation and 
transportation validation of the PFS and AI/PEN. Three consecutive PFS lots were produced. PFS release 
specification testing results for the syringe lots were provided and all lots release results passed the 
proposed commercial specification. In conclusion, validation data demonstrate that the process is 
controlled and consistent when operated within the defined operating ranges. 
Control of excipients 
Adequate information has been provided on the control of the excipients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015

All excipients used are of Ph. Eur. quality. 
Product specification 
The finished product specification for the 140 mg/ml PFS and additional specifications for the prefilled 
AI/pen are presented. 
The AI/pen is assembled with the PFS prior to testing, additional test methods and acceptance criteria are 
used to assure the quality of the 140 mg/mL prefilled AI/pen at release. 
The proposed list of finished product release test comprises the same methods as used for the active 
substance, with some additional tests.  
Where necessary specifications were appropriately tightened or justified.    
Analytical methods 
Summaries of the analytical methods used to assess both evolocumab active substance and finished 
product were provided and are appropriate. Some analytical methods are specific to either the 140 
mg/mL PFS or the 140 mg/ml AI/pen. 
In conclusion, the methods proposed for the finished product release testing in addition to the ones for 
active substance release testing have been sufficiently described and appropriately validated. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analytical data were provided for all 140 mg/mL PFS lots used during clinical development and for 
product manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facilities. The data complied with the respective 
specifications. 
Reference materials 
The same reference standard(s) are used for both evolocumab active substance and finished product 
testing (reference is made to the active substance section).  
Stability of the product 
Finished product stability studies were performed per the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines Stability 
Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products (ICH Q5C) and Stability Testing of New Active substances 
and Products (ICH Q1A). Stability studies were conducted at the recommended storage condition of 5°C 
to support expiry and at elevated temperatures to support limited room temperature storage (controlled, 
25°C or less) and to support potential temperature deviations during handling and transportation. The 
finished product is sensitive to light, but shown to be stable during temperature cycling studies. 
Stability data compiled to date for the 140 mg/mL PFS and 140 mg/mL AI/pen primary, validation and 
supporting lots stored at the recommended and accelerated storage conditions of 5°C, 25°C, and 30°C 
remain within the proposed stability specification acceptance criteria through the latest time points 
tested. Overall the stability data support the shelf life as claimed in the SmPC. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
Early phase clinical finished product was manufactured at Amgen Thousand Oaks (ATO), using 70 mg/mL 
active substance. The primary container used during early phase clinical studies was a 5 mL Type I glass 
vial containing 70 mg/mL evolocumab. The primary container used during late phase clinical development 
was a 1 mL Type I glass PFS (or prefilled AI/pen version 1.0) containing 140 mg/mL active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 19/122 
 
 
 
 
 
For commercial production, the evolocumab finished product process was transferred to the facility at 
Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML 1) located in Juncos, Puerto Rico. The comparability of product in the 
vial (ATO) and PFS (ATO) was discussed. The differences found are not expected to have impact on 
quality, safety and efficacy. 
PFS (ATO), PFS (AML-1), prefilled AI/pen 1.0 (AML-1) and prefilled AI/pen 1.5 (AML-1) finished product 
were comparable, as demonstrated by the lot release, characterization, and stressed stability data 
presented.  
Adventitious agents 
The information provided on non-viral adventitious agents is sufficient. No material of animal origin are 
used in the manufacturing process of evolocumab. No virus particles were detected in the cell banks, 
other than A-type and C-type retrovirus-like particles. 
Viral clearance studies were performed for the chromatography steps, the viral inactivation step, and the 
filtration step using appropriate model viruses. Appropriately validated scaled down models were used for 
the different manufacturing steps.  
The results of the virus clearance studies show acceptable reduction of the model virus studied. No 
significant differences were observed when comparing results for new and used resin. The total 
(cumulative) estimated XMuLV reduction shows an excess retrovirus clearance. 
Virus carry over was assessed with used resin by executing a non-spiked run after cleaning and 
regeneration of the column. The results gave no reason for concern. 
Post Approval Change Management Protocol 
The applicant submitted a Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) for the addition, an 
alternative manufacturing facility for the formulation and aseptic filling of evolocumab 140 mg/mL 
prefilled syringes (PFS).  
The changes in the manufacturing process were considered to be primarily of GMP concern which would 
be evaluated at the relevant GMP inspection for the use AML-14. The presented investigational quality 
results did not reveal any significant impact on quality attributes. Overall the strategy described in the 
comparability protocol seems suitable. The approach taken by the applicant in determining the 
equivalence limits is considered acceptable and would be appropriate for the PACMP as well. The proposed 
post approval change management protocol is considered suitable to support a finished product 
manufacturing site addition. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant submitted a full dossier for its product Repatha (evolocumab). In summary, the CTD is of 
appropriate quality and provides an adequate description of the characterisation, manufacture and 
control of the active substance and finished product. The different aspects of the chemical, 
pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The information provided 
demonstrates consistent batch-to-batch production of Repatha achieving a well-defined quality for the 
active substance and the finished product. No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the 
product manufacture and there is no risk of contamination with viral or TSE agents by these ingredients.  
No major issues were raised during the initial assessment of the dossier; however a number of 
deficiencies and points for clarification were identified. The main issue concerned the control strategy, 
including the identification of Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), criticality assignment of process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 20/122 
 
 
 
 
 
parameters (PPs) and in process controls (IPCs), some aspects of the finished product and active 
substance specifications, and the handling of potential future changes to PPs and IPCs included in the CTD. 
The applicant applied a ranking system from insignificant to severe to assess the criticality of quality 
attributes, nevertheless initially did not identify CQAs as such. As this complicated the identification of 
critical PPs, the applicant was asked to clearly identify and justify the CQAs. In addition, the applicant was 
asked to re-assess criticality of PPs, focussing on PPs that were shown to have a statistical significant and 
practical important effect on the identified CQAs and on PPs. Critical IPCs were identified and appropriate 
action and/or rejection limits were set. Upon request, the applicant confirmed that future changes to 
non-critical and critical PPs and IPCs included in the CTD will be reported in accordance with the Variation 
Regulation.  
The discussion on active substance and finished product release testing focussed on the inclusion of tests 
and setting of appropriate release and end of shelf life specifications for some of the quality attributes. 
The stability data support the proposed shelf life of the active substance and of the finished product as 
stated in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  All issues raised have been adequately addressed by the applicant 
with two recommendations for future development remaining (see section 
2.2.6 below). Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  As only 10 DS batches have been used so far, it is recommended to the applicant to re-assess the 
finished product specifications after production of 30 commercial scale active substance lots. 
2.  It is recommended that the first post-approval lot that will come available is put on a stability 
study which includes the optional short term storage (1 week at 25°C). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 
type 9 (PCSK9). When PCSK9 binds to LDLR, the LDLR is targeted for destruction rather than being 
recycled back to the cell surface, thereby reducing the levels of LDLR available for low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-c) clearance from the bloodstream.  
Evolocumab binds selectively and with high affinity to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding 
to the LDLR on the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. The inhibition of 
PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased LDLR expression and subsequent decreased circulating 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 21/122 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations of LDL-c. The antibody is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Pharmacodynamics at molecular level: Binding affinities of evolocumab to human, cynomolgus monkey, 
hamster, and mouse PCSK9 were evaluated by KinExA and BIAcore™ solution equilibrium binding assays. 
The KD values were determined to be approximately 16 pM, 8 pM, 14 pM, and 17000 pM for binding to 
human, cynomolgus monkey, hamster, and mouse PCSK9, respectively. The capability of anti-PCSK9 
antibodies (AMG-145 or 31H4.2) to compete with wildtype (WT) PCSK9 or the gain-of-function (GOF) 
variant PCSK9-D374Y for binding to LDLR was analysed using an ELISA assay. The evolocumab IC50 
values were 1.94 ± 0.32 nM (mean ± SD; n = 3) with WT PCSK9. 
Pharmacodynamics in vitro: HepG2 cells treated with anti PCSK9 antibodies (AMG-145 or 31H4.2) slightly 
increase total LDLR levels, which is also reflected on the cell surface for AMG-145. Upon treatment with 
statins, total LDLR increases more efficiently, which is also reflected in increase in cell surface levels of 
LDLR. Incubation with statins causes a dose-dependent increase in PCSK9 protein expression in 
HepG2cells. 
The applicant tested the capacity of anti-PCSK9 antibodies to influence uptake of fluorescently labelled 
LDL by HepG2 cells transfected with LDLR, either the wild-type or the Gain of Function variant harbouring 
the D374Y mutation. Both tested antibodies, AMG145 and 31H4.2, were able to increase LDL uptake upon 
incubation of the cells with these antibodies. The effect was more potent in the cells transfected with the 
gain of function mutant of LDLR. The proposed mechanism is the inhibition of the degradation process of 
LDLR by inhibition of PCSK9. 
Pharmacodynamics in vivo: Evolocumab binds to PCSK9 in Hamster and is pharmacologically active as 
well, lowering cholesterol (both HDL-c and LDL-c). Using Gold Syrian Hamster, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic parameters could be determined for anti PCSK9 antibody evolocumab / AMG 145. 
Levels of LDL-c, HDL-c and total cholesterol levels were decreased. Hepatic LDLR protein levels were 
increased. Duration of both effects was dose dependent. 
A single subcutaneous injection of evolocumab in Cynomolgous monkey led to a dose dependent decrease 
in LDL-c and total cholesterol. HDL-c in serum seems not to be affected by evolocumab administration in 
Cynomolgous monkey. A slight decrease in TG was also observed. In the clinic, slightly decreased TG 
levels were observed as well, but not regarded to be a risk. 
Next to evolocumab / AMG145, the applicant also assessed the effectiveness of other PCSK9 antibodies in 
mice (after introducing PCSK9 with AAV) and in cynomolgous monkey. Serum concentration of antibody 
over time and concentration of non HDL in serum were followed. AMG-145 was most potent in decreasing 
the levels of serum cholesterol.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Consistent with its role in regulating hepatic LDLR, PCSK9 is predominantly expressed in the liver but has 
also been detected in other organs, including the intestine, kidney, pancreas and brain. Free PCSK9 is also 
found in the systemic circulation but human plasma concentrations can vary widely. The broad 
localization of PCSK9 raises the expectation of processes that could be secondarily affected by 
evolocumab treatment. Several possible processes involving cholesterol have been evaluated by the 
Assessment report

applicant performing a thorough literature survey and discussing the potential of evolocumab to influence 
other processes than the primary pharmacological LDL-c lowering.  
From the current understanding from literature as reviewed by the applicant and results from (non-) 
clinical studies it is strongly suggested that evolocumab is not likely to: have impact on the brain and 
cognitive function, play a role in hepatitis C infectivity, have impact on insulin resistance and diabetes 
risk, be involved in mechanistic basis of statin-mediated myopathy. 
The potential of PCSK9 to interact with other LDLR family members have been investigated in vivo and in 
vitro. PCSK9 has affinity for and interacts with LDLR. Contradictory results are reported in literature for 
the interaction between PCSK9 with VLDLR and ApoER2. APoER2 is mainly localized to the brain. 
Antibodies do only minimally cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), if at all. Since evolocumab is an 
antibody likely not present in the brain, a possible interaction with this receptor might be of less 
relevance. The possible binding of PCSK9 to VLDLR might be relevant. Levels of VLDL and triglycerides are 
decreased upon evolocumab treatment in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Whether this is a direct or 
indirect effect is not clear, but it does not lead to a risk for the patient.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The impact of a single intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg to cynomolgous monkey did not reveal an impact 
of evolocumab treatment on cardiovascular parameters, respiratory rate and neurobehavioral evaluation. 
These safety pharmacology parameters were addressed sufficiently in this study and give no reason for 
further studies.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have not been investigated by the applicant. The antibody is 
designed to bind specifically to PCSK9 and it is very unlikely that it will bind to other human targets. The 
applicant performed tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies to explore the binding of monoclonal antibodies 
and related antibody-like products to antigenic determinants in tissues from hamster and cynomolgous 
monkey and human. The CHMP agreed there was no need to perform pharmacodynamics drug interaction 
studies, apart from the TCR studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bio-analytical methods: Unbound serum evolocumab concentration in hamster and cynomolgus monkey 
serum was determined according to the validated analytical procedure for the determination of 
evolocumab in cynomolgus monkey serum and hamster. Unbound (free) PCSK9 in cynomolgus monkey 
serum was measured using a qualified, sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). The methods were originally developed at Amgen Inc., Seattle, WA. The validation reports for 
determination of anti-evolocumab antibodies or neutralising antibodies were not included in the dossier.  
Analytical Method Validation Report for an Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay for the Detection of 
Antibodies Against AMG 145 in Cynomolgus Monkey Serum (MVR-000326): The ECL method validation 
included establishment of cut-point and lower limit of reliable detection (LLRD), assay sensitivity, 
specificity, drug tolerance, stability, and intra- and inter-assay variability. The validation was 
appropriately performed. At high drug serum concentrations drug interference might affect accurate 
detection of anti-drug antibodies. However, based on the study results the method cam be considered 
appropriate and sufficient to inform about the cynomolgus monkey toxicity data.

Analytical Method Validation Report for an Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay for the Detection of 
Antibodies Against AMG 145 in Hamster Serum (MVR-000365): The ECL method validation included 
establishment of cut-point and lower limit of reliable detection (LLRD), assay sensitivity, specificity, drug 
tolerance, stability, and intra- and inter-assay variability. The validation was appropriately performed. 
The presence of high concentration of evolocumab in the hamster serum at the higher dose levels might 
interfere with the detection of anti-drug antibodies since the drug levels exceeded the assay tolerance 
limits. However, as pharmacological activity was demonstrated it can be concluded that interpretation of 
the hamster toxicity data is not hampered. 
Validation of a Receptor Binding Assay for the Detection of a Neutralizing Antibodies Against AMG 145 in 
Cynomolgus Monkey Serum (MVR-000326): This assay is a receptor-ligand binding assay that detects 
antibodies present in cynomolgus monkey serum that neutralize the biological activity of evolocumab. 
Biotinylated human PCSK9-D374Y is used as a ligand that will bind to recombinant human LDL-R coated 
on the plate. The complex is being detected using streptavidin conjugated ruthenium. Methodology 
includes a screening phase and a specificity phase. The validation included establishment of cut points, 
specificity, drug interference, and freeze-thaw stability. The validation was appropriately performed, and 
the method can be considered appropriate and sufficient for the purpose. 
The possibility of interference in measurements with anti-drug-antibodies is not addressed by the 
company. However, this issue is discussed in the toxicology section of antigenicity. 
Absorption: Following SC administration in monkeys; the following pharmacokinetic parameters were 
determined  
- 
- 
The absolute bioavailability was approximately 82%.  
The mean Cmax and Tmax increased with dose, ranging from 1.82 μg/mL to 833 μg/mL and 
approximately 1 day to 4 days for the 0.2 and 30 mg/kg doses, respectively.  
- 
The Cmax increased 457-fold increase for a 150-fold increase in dose (0.2 to 30 mg/kg).  
-  Non-linearity in exposure was also observed based on mean area under the serum evolocumab 
concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf). 
- 
- 
- 
The values increased greater than dose-proportionally from 0.2 to 30 mg/kg (~3000-fold for an 
approximate 150-fold increase in dose).  
The mean AUCinf values were approximately dose-proportional (< 2-fold change in AUC when 
adjusted for dose) from 10 to 30 mg/kg. 
These pharmacokinetic observations were consistent with target-mediated elimination. 
Distribution: Following IV administration of 3 mg/kg to cynomolgous monkeys, the estimated unbound 
mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) value in the serum was 25.3 mL/kg and comparable to 
plasma volume (45 mL/kg). Following SC administration, the apparent unbound volume of distribution 
(Vz/F) declined as a function of dose ranging from 64.8 mL/kg at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg to 19.9 mL/kg at 
a dose of 30 mg/kg. This is consistent with antibodies that exhibit capacity-limited binding. 
Metabolism: Evolocumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic 
pathways.  
Excretion: As a monoclonal antibody, no renal excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. 
Therefore, no specific studies to measure excretion of evolocumab were conducted.

PK different formulations: PK and PD from three different formulations were compared. Reference 
formulation was 70 mg/mL and the two test formulations had evolocumab concentration of 120 or 140 
mg/mL. The PK and PD were slightly different. Cmax and AUC0-t were slightly lower for the two test 
concentrations compared to the reference formulation of 70 mg/mL. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No formal single-dose toxicity study have been performed which was agreed. Cynomolgus monkey or 
Hamster did not show acute toxicity after a first dose with evolocumab up to 300 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Evolocumab is pharmacological active in human, Cynomolgous monkey and hamster. The latter two were 
used in toxicology studies, where also the pharmacodynamics parameters were measured. In the 
repeated dose toxicity studies animals were exposed to evolocumab, up to 300 mg/kg, for max. of 3 
months (hamster) and 6 months (monkey). No toxicity was observed upon administration of evolocumab 
up to 300 mg/kg QW up to 3 months (hamster) and up to 6 months in Cynomolgous monkeys. Only the 
intended pharmacological effect of decreased serum LDL-c and total cholesterol (up to approximately 
85% and 40%, respectively) were observed in these studies and was reversible upon cessation of 
treatment.  
No adverse effects were observed when evolocumab (up to 100 mg/kg Q2W) was dosed in combination 
with rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg daily [QD], oral) to Cynomolgus monkeys for 3 months. In this combination 
study, reductions in serum LDL-c and total cholesterol were slightly more pronounced than observed 
previously with evolocumab alone, and were reversible upon cessation of treatment. However, the lack of 
pharmacological activity of rosuvastatin needs to be explained.  
The Applicant refers to recent publications which describe inconsistent results for statin-mediated effects 
on LDL-C in the Cynomolgus monkey. The Applicant further clarifies that one explanation for the lack of 
pharmacological activity may be related to the statin-induced increase in PCSK9 expression. The 
Applicant further refers to the recent published data on additive effects for another PCSK9 inhibitor 
monoclonal antibody when administered to Cynomolgus monkeys in combination with atorvastatin.  
This may be the case, but as these are hypotheses it is not changing the situation that the data do not 
enable the evaluation of the additive effects of evolocumab and rosuvastatin on lowering of the 
cholesterol levels. The low dose (5 mg/kg) may explain the lack of pharmacological activity of 
rosuvastatin but does not justify the dose selection for the study; according to the publically available 
data, the therapeutic range seems to be higher than the 5 mg/kg used in the toxicological study. 
However, neither drug had significant effect on the PK of the other drug in Cynomolgus monkeys. In 
addition, the effect of statins, including rosuvastatin, on evolocumab has also been evaluated in clinical 
studies (leading to a modest decrease in evolocumab exposure that does not affect the 
pharmacodynamics of LDL-C lowering). Based on these data pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions 
were considered not likely.  
Thus, the effect of treatment with evolocumab, at exposure levels higher than clinical exposure was 
limited to the pharmacological effect, which was a reduction in LDL-c, cholesterol and, not consistently, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 25/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
triglycerides. Apparently, this did not lead to any toxicological effect, suggesting that laboratory animals 
have excess levels of LDL-c and cholesterol.  
Genotoxicity 
Evolocumab is a recombinant protein, made up entirely of naturally occurring amino acids. Therefore 
there were no genotoxicity studies performed which was agreed by the CHMP.  
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant performed a long term repeated dose toxicity or carcinogenicity study with evolocumab in 
hamsters. No evolocumab related neoplasm has been found in this study. Evolocumab related effects in 
this study were also limited to the expected pharmacodynamics effects and further supported the 
observations that evolocumab does not evoke adverse effect when tested in animals at exposure levels up 
to 15 times the clinical exposure. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The nonclinical reproductive and developmental safety profile of evolocumab was informed by three 
studies: (1) an enhanced pre-postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys, (2) a fertility and 
early embryonic development study in hamsters and (3) assessment of male and female fertility 
endpoints in the 6 month cynomolgus monkey study.  
Evolocumab treatment did not affect male and female fertility in hamsters (analysed in study 114975) 
and monkeys (analysed in study 110359). Infant monkeys from mothers treated with 50 mg/kg/dose 
evolocumab Q2W (which was pharmacological active in mothers) were exposed via transfer of the 
antibody over the placenta, or via the colostrum. Levels of evolocumab could be measured at birthday 14 
(100 µg/ml). This level of antibody in serum evokes a pharmacological effect in adults, however in infants 
only a minimal reduction in LDL-c and total cholesterol was observed. The serum LDL-C levels were 
decreased in infants of the mothers that had been treated with evolocumab compared to the infants of the 
untreated mothers. The LDL-C levels remained lower until the end of the observation period of 6 months. 
The concern was whether evolocumab treatment during pregnancy could lead to adverse effects in infants 
that have been exposed to evolocumab in utero. The data (group means) implied that the LDL-C levels of 
infants of the mothers that had been treated with evolocumab during pregnancy until parturition were 
consistently lower than in the infants that had not been exposed to evolocumab in utero. Knowing that 
evolocumab concentrations in infant sera were too low to have pharmacological activity raised a concern 
of whether in utero exposure to evolocumab might induce some other effects that would lead to sustained 
reduction in serum LDL-C levels in infants as seen at 6 months (PND180). A newly insightful graphical 
presentation of the data provided clarification and alleviated the concern. The data were considered 
sufficient to conclude that in utero exposure to evolocumab did not adversely impact the infants up to 6 
months of observation. 
Three mothers made anti-evolocumab antibodies, of which one had neutralizing antibodies. No anti- 
evolocumab antibodies were measured in infants. The lack of treatment related findings suggested that 
infants are not so dependent on cholesterol from maternal circulation, but rather from endogenous 
production, which is also suggested in literature.

Peadiatric safety:  
Evolocumab is being evaluated for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in 
patients 12 years and older. No dedicated juvenile animal studies have been performed (and none are 
planned), but the completed studies provided adequate nonclinical safety support for evaluation of the 
intended paediatric population.  
In accordance with the PIP for evolocumab the applicant provided studies agreed with the PCDO:  
(1) a 3-months toxicity study with Cynomolgus monkeys between age of 3 and 7 years and (2) an 
Embryo-foetal and Postnatal Development (EFPD) were infants could be followed. The first of these 
studies tested evolocumab in Cynomolgus monkeys of 2.5 years and older (in the 6-weeks study), which 
would generally correspond to human ages of approximately 10 years and older, but for some postnatal 
events (e.g., immune system development), extrapolation to younger human ages would be appropriate. 
The supportive EFPD study was age’s equivalent to 0 to 2 years in humans as claimed by the applicant. 
The developmental NOEL was 50 mg/kg Q2W and evolocumab-related effects were limited to expected 
pharmacology (serum LDL-c and total cholesterol lowering) in the mothers.  
No toxicity has been observed, but also the pharmacodynamic effect was less apparent in these animals. 
In contrast, mature animals exposed at these levels do show a PD effect. Fourteen cases (3 placebo and 
11 patients) in the age of 12-18 years old have been treated with evolocumab in the clinical studies. The 
6-weeks rather than the EFPD study provided support for the peadiatric indication. The CHMP issued a 
positive opinion for evolocumab in the treatment adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Exposure levels in female animals are slightly lower than in male animals. Exposure increases more than 
dose proportional and Cmax is increasing dose proportional. These pharmacokinetic observations are 
consistent with target-mediated elimination. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance tests with formulations from process 1 (70 mg/mL) and process 2 (140 mg/mL) showed 
no irritation of injection site reactions and has been sufficiently addressed. In repeat-dose studies, 
routinely assessed the potential for evolocumab-related injection site reactions and none were observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity was sufficiently addressed in the repeated dose studies and the pre and post-natal 
reproduction toxicity study. No antigenic response in the Gold Syrian Hamster against evolocumab has 
been observed, which was not surprising since the antibody is produced by Hamster cells (CHO). The only 
species that remained available for testing the antigenic capacity of evolocumab were Cynomolgus 
monkey. As stated by the applicant, 10% of the monkeys showed antibody development against 
evolocumab, half of which appeared to be neutralizing antibodies. In some animals, an effect on the 
pharmacological action of evolocumab was detectable. No neutralizing antibodies have been observed in 
the clinical development. 
Immunotoxicity has been sufficiently addressed in the repeated dose toxicity studies and evolocumab 
treatment did not show an effect on peripheral blood immunophenotyping, anti-KLH antibody (IgM and 
Assessment report

IgG) responses in the TDAR assay or Natural Killer Cell cytotoxicity (NKC) function. Thereby, it was 
discussed in the secondary pharmacology section.  
In the 6 months repeat dose toxicity study, the analysis of T cell dependent antibody responses (TDAR) 
revealed a statistically significant reduction of anti-KLH IgG response at evolocumab dose levels of 3 and 
300 mg/kg, and a statistically significant reduced trend in the secondary IgG response. These data 
suggested that evolocumab treatment might impair the T cell dependent antibody responses. The 
Applicant re-analysed the TDAR data after removing the animals with pre-existing anti-KLH antibodies 
from the analysis. It was acknowledged that removing baseline positive samples reduced the background 
noise and might increase the informative value of the TDAR analyses. The re-analysed data from selected 
animals showed no effect on IgG or IgM antibody responses. However, the selection of animals that were 
removed from the re-analyses seemed inappropriate and unjustified. The Applicant explained and 
justified their re-analyses. The applicant discussed their approach of selective data analysis, which was 
not entirely accepted. The CHMP agreed that the data do not indicate that evolocumab treatment would 
result in immunotoxicity. The re-analysis of available TDAR data was not considered however 
appropriately justified, and since the full data set had to be taken into consideration, the concern of 
potential risk of impairment of T cell dependent antibody response at least after long term treatment (3 
months) remained. Whether or not the reduced TDAR upon evolocumab treatment in monkey would be a 
risk in humans, was uncertain and is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Tissue Cross Reactivity: A TCR assay with evolocumab has been performed on Human, Hamster and 
Monkey tissue. In vitro binding of evolocumab to extracellular surface elements in the following normal 
tissues was observed:- human - striated skeletal muscle, cardiomyocytes, and smooth muscle myocytes 
in the skin;- Cynomolgous monkey - striated skeletal muscle, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle 
myocytes in the eye (iris) and skin; - hamster - striated skeletal muscle; cardiomyocytes; and smooth 
muscle myocytes in the skin. 
However, in vivo evaluations of cardiac function and histopathological evaluations of cardiac and skeletal 
muscle, skin, and eye, revealed no functional or morphological effects of evolocumab on these tissues. 
The poor specificity of the assay is also recognized by the authorities and reflected in ICH S6(R1). Tissue 
binding per se does not indicate biological activity in vivo. Findings should be evaluated and interpreted in 
the context of the overall pharmacology and safety assessment package.” 
The lack of further studies addressing immunotoxicity, dependence potential, metabolites and impurities 
is agreed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA have been done, which is agreed seen the nature of the product. Evolocumab is a protein 
composed of normal amino acids and readily biodegradable. Therefore it does not pose a risk for the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of evolocumab were studied in HepG2 cells 
and in Mice, Gold Syrian Hamster and Cynomolous monkey.  
Influence of Evolocumab on LDLR levels 
The applicant focussed on the in vivo increase of LDL receptors (LDLR) in the liver of evolocumab treated 
Gold Syrian Hamster and a subsequent decrease in LDL-c in serum, the pharmacological effect that was

EMA/CHMP/222019/2015

also noticed in the Cynomolous monkey. PCSK9 antibody targets PCSK9 present in serum. Functioning of 
LDLR present in other than liver tissues might be also influenced by evolocumab therapy leading to 
increase of LDLR levels and more efficient LDL-c uptake in that specific tissue. These tissues may thus 
accumulate LDL-c upon evolocumab treatment. Data on tissue distribution of LDLR, which could be 
upregulated due to evolocumab treatment, were discussed during current procedure including a 
discussion on the effect of evolocumab on LDLR other than hepatic and the influence of evolocumab on 
LDL-c uptake in tissues other than hepatic tissue. Literature data indicated that, unlike the liver, PCSK9 
plays a much less important role in regulating LDLR levels in extra-hepatic tissues. There were no signs 
of cholesterol accumulation in extra-hepatic tissues and no adverse effects in extra-hepatic tissues were 
observed. Thereby, in case of minor increase of LDL in extra-hepatic tissues, feedback systems are in 
place within all cells of the body to tightly regulate intracellular cholesterol levels and prevent cholesterol 
accumulation. 
Justification for selection of animals in TDAR analyses 
A statistically significant reduction of anti-KLH (anti- Keyhole limpet hemocyanin) IgG response at 
evolocumab dose levels of 3 and 300 mg/kg, and a statistically significant reduced trend in the secondary 
IgG response suggesting a potential impairment of the T cell dependent antibody responses (TDAR) was 
observed in Cynomolgus monkeys. The Applicant re-analysed the TDAR data after removing the animals 
with pre-existing anti-KLH antibodies. The data set from selected animals showed no effect on IgG or IgM 
antibody responses. However, the selection of animals that were removed from the re-analyses seems 
inappropriate and unjustified, and thus the applicant was requested to explain and justify their 
re-analyses, and re-discuss the overall safety of evolocumab. It was agreed that the data did not indicate 
that evolocumab treatment would result in immunotoxicity however the re-analysis of available TDAR 
data was not considered appropriately justified, and since the full data set should be taken into 
consideration, the concern of potential risk of impairment of T cell dependent antibody response at least 
after long term treatment (3 months) remained. Whether or not the reduced TDAR upon evolocumab 
treatment in monkey would be a risk in humans was uncertain and is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity anti-drug-antibodies 
The occurrence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) was assessed in hamster and Cynomolgous monkey. 
However, the validation reports for the analytical methods for anti-evolocumab antibody detection in the 
hamster and in the Cynomolgus monkey, as well as for determination of neutralising antibodies were 
initially lacking in the dossier and were provided during procedure. In hamster, evolocumab was not 
immunogenic. In Cynomolgus monkey the incidence of anti-evolocumab antibodies (antidrug antibodies, 
ADA) was not higher than 10%. In some animals these ADA were neutralising. At high dose levels no ADA 
were detected, but it could not be excluded that high levels of circulating test article during the dosing 
phase may have interfered with the detection of ADA. The formation of neutralizing antibodies was 
included in the RMP as a potential risk. It was found reassuring that neutralising antibodies were not found 
to be formed in clinical studies. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Evolocumab is being evaluated for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in 
patients 12 years and older. No dedicated juvenile animal studies have been performed (and none are 
planned), but the completed studies provided adequate nonclinical safety support for evaluation of the 
intended paediatric population.  
The applicant provided studies: (1) a repeat dose 3-months toxicity study with Cynomolgus monkeys 
between age of 3 and 7 years and (2) an Embryo-foetal and Postnatal Development (EFPD) were infants 
Assessment report

were followed. The first of these studies tested evolocumab in Cynomolgus monkeys that were 2.5 years 
and older (over 6-weeks). This would generally correspond to human ages of approximately 10 years and 
older. The supportive EFPD study was age’s equivalent to 0 to 2 years in humans. The developmental 
NOEL was 50 mg/kg Q2W and evolocumab-related effects were limited to expected pharmacology (serum 
LDL-c and total cholesterol lowering) in the mothers. No toxicity has been observed, but also the 
pharmacodynamic effect was less apparent in these animals. In contrast, mature animals exposed at 
these levels do show a PD effect. Fourteen cases (3 placebo and 11 patients) in the age of 12-18 years old 
have been treated with evolocumab in the clinical studies. The 6-weeks rather than the EFPD study 
provided support for the peadiatric indication. The CHMP issued a positive opinion for evolocumab in the 
treatment adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in 
combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive pharmacological and toxicological data package was provided to support the application 
for evolocumab in treatment of adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidaemia 
and in adults and adolescents with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.  
Evolocumab was not carcinogenic in hamsters at exposures much higher than patients receiving 
evolocumab at 420 mg once monthly. The mutagenic potential of evolocumab has not been evaluated 
which was agreed. In hamsters and Cynomolgus monkeys at exposures much higher than patients 
receiving 420 mg evolocumab once monthly, no effect on male or female fertility was observed. In 
Cynomolgus monkeys at exposures much higher than patients receiving 420 mg evolocumab once 
monthly, no effects on embryo-foetal or postnatal development (up to 6 months of age) were observed.  
Apart from a reduced T-cell Dependent Antibody Response in cynomolgus monkeys immunized with KLH 
after 3 months of treatment with evolocumab, no adverse effects were observed in hamsters (up to 3 
months) and Cynomolgus monkeys (up to 6 months) at exposures much higher than patients receiving 
evolocumab at 420 mg once monthly. The intended pharmacological effect of decreased serum LDL-C and 
total cholesterol were observed in these studies and was reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
In combination with rosuvastatin for 3 months, no adverse effects were observed in Cynomolgous 
monkeys at exposures much higher than patients receiving 420 mg evolocumab once monthly. 
Reductions in serum LDL-C and total cholesterol were more pronounced than observed previously with 
evolocumab alone, and were reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant was seeking approval for the use of evolucumab in a variety of settings: 
−  Primary Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia 
o  patients on a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies (eg, ezetimibe),  
o  patients with statin intolerance, and  
o  patients in whom a statin is not clinically appropriate (e.g., patients on fibrates, cyclosporine, 
certain CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as certain HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, and 
itraconazole, and patients with statin hypersensitivity).

•  Overview of clinical studies 
The following clinical programme was performed and submitted within current application: 
Figure Organization of the Evolocumab Clinical Studies in the Submission 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology program were to characterize the initial safety, tolerability, 
PK, PD, and exposure-response properties of evolocumab in healthy subjects, patients with primary 
hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia, and patients with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The PK and PD data in this application were used to:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
support the selection of the dosing regimens for phase 3 studies in the 2 proposed indications; 
assess the relationships between dose and exposure and between exposure and 
pharmacodynamic response; 
assess the effect of mild to moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of evolocumab (subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not 
evaluated); 
assess the effect of other patient-specific factors (familial hypercholesterolemia, renal 
impairment, statin treatment, or demographic covariates such as age, sex, or body weight) on 
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of evolocumab; 
evaluate potential effects of anti-evolocumab antibodies on evolocumab pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
In Table PK01 the studies are listed in which PK and PD data with rich sampling schemes were collected. 
In other Phase III studies, limited blood samples were taken for PK purpose. These data are also used for 
the population PK analysis.

Two clinical PK equivalence studies to bridge the data from phase 3 studies that used the AI/pen 
presentation containing commercial drug substance (Process 2) to the AMD and PFS presentations 
containing commercial drug substance: 
•  Study 20110168 was an open-label, randomized, parallel study in 292 healthy volunteers that 
was conducted to demonstrate pharmacokinetic equivalence of 1 AMD (test article) to 3 AI/pens 
(reference article). 
•  Study 20120133 was an open-label, randomized, crossover study in 96 healthy volunteers that 
was conducted to demonstrate pharmacokinetic equivalence of 1 PFS (test article) to 1 AI/pen 
(reference article). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical program consists of ten studies of which 9 studies are performed in healthy subjects and one 
study in patients with hypercholesterolemia (familial and non-familial). The different studies performed 
seem appropriate to characterise the PK and PD of evolocumab.

Population Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic Modelling 
The applicant performed an extensive Population pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of evolocumab in healthy volunteers and different type of 
patients. Analyses were based on pooled data from 5474 patients from 11 studies (see Table PK03), 
including 3414 subjects that received evolocumab and were included in the final population 
pharmacokinetic analysis: phase 1 Studies 20080397 and 20080398; phase 2 studies 20101154, 
20101155, 20090158, and 20090159; and phase 3 studies 20110109, 20110114, 20110115, 20110116, 
and 20110117. Sparse PK data were collected in the phase 3 studies. 
The updated population pharmacokinetic model fit the data adequately, and parameter estimates of the 
updated model were similar to those from the phase 1+2 model. In the final PK covariate model, body 
weight, sex (female), statin co-administration, statin + ezetimibe co-administration, and PCSK9 baseline 
emerged as statistically significant covariates on evolocumab pharmacokinetics. The outcome of the 
study with respect to the intrinsic variables is discussed under the specific headings. 
Absorption and bioequivalence 
The relative bioavailability of evolocumab after subcutaneous administration is about 55% compared with 
the intravenous route of administration. 
Study 20110168 showed that the 420 mg dose administered with the AMD presentation at 120 mg/mL 
with a 3.5 mL fill was pharmacokinetically equivalent to the reference presentation of 3 AI/pens (1 mL 
each, 140 mg/mL). Study 20120133 showed that the 140 mg dose administered with the PFS 
presentation at 140 mg/mL with a 1 mL fill was pharmacokinetically equivalent to the reference 
presentation of 1 AI/Pen (140 mg/mL, 1mL pen).  
Bioequivalence between different devices and volumes of administrations has been demonstrated. This 
application includes 1 mL prefilled syringe and 1 mL AI/pen. The AMD device is not part of this application. 
For pharmacokinetic analysis, the Applicant included only subjects who had sufficient number of samples 
for reliable estimation of PK parameters (exclusion criteria - sample missing before or after Cmax; for AUC 
missing 2 or more samples or sample before LLOQ missing). These definitions are not in line with the 
Guideline on Bioequivalence Investigation.  A sensitivity analysis including all subjects with calculation of 
the AUC0-∞ was submitted, to fully characterise also terminal elimination phase. With this parameter 
bioequivalence was also established. 
Both bioequivalence studies were conducted using evolocumab manufactured by Process 2. Some phase 
1 and 2 studies were conducted using evolocumab manufactured by Process 1. The Applicant did submit 
comparative data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics from the OLE Study 20110110 where 
subjects transitioned from Process 1 to Process 2 with sufficient evidence of comparability. These data 
was further supported by comparative data from population PK analysis. Hence, bridging of clinical data 
between Process 1 and 2 product was considered acceptable. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution after iv administration is about 3.3 l. This is considered similar to the plasma 
volume. The apparent elimination half-life is about 11 to 15 days. 
In the figure below a typical concentration-time curve of evolocumab upon subcutaneous administration 
420 mg in serum is given.

Metabolism 
⨪
As evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody, no in vitro permeability, in vitro metabolism, or in vitro 
metabolic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. The absence of in vitro and in vivo metabolism 
studies are considered acceptable as monoclonal antibody are degraded in the body to small peptide 
molecules by non-specific processes.  
Elimination 
Evolocumab is eliminated mainly by target mediated binding to PCSK9 at low concentrations. This is a 
saturable process and causes non-linear pharmacokinetics in the lower concentration range. Evolocumab 
is also eliminated by non-specific cleavage to small peptides. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The Cmax and AUClast of evolocumab in patients receiving a high-dose statin were slightly lower compared 
with subjects receiving lower statin doses probably due to higher basal PCSK9 levels. The Cmax of 
evolocumab in subjects with HeFH was slightly lower compared with subjects without HeFH on low- to 
moderate-dose statins receiving the same evolocumab dose regimen (140 mg SC Q2W × 3). However, 
the AUClast values were comparable. 
Pharmacokinetic changes did not result in differences in unbound PCSK9 and LDL-C responses between 
subjects with and without HeFH (See Pharmacodynamic Assessment). 
In patients with HoFH the evolocumab concentrations seems lower than in HeFH patients due to the 
higher basal levels of PCSK9 in this group of patients. However, when evolocumab was used in 
combination with a statin, with or without other lipid lowering therapy, HoFH did not have a clinically 
meaningful effect on the observed PK profile for evolocumab compared with non-HoFH populations.

Intrinsic factors 
As expected for monoclonal antibodies, renal impairment did not show a clinical significant effect on the 
clearance of evolocumab. 
After a single dose of evolocumab 140 mg SC in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, 
exposure decreased with increasing hepatic impairment (See Figure below). Median tmax was 4.5 or 5.0 
days in each group. Compared with healthy subjects, subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment had mean AUC last values that were 39% and 47% lower, respectively and mean Cmax values 
that were 21% and 34% lower, respectively. The basal PCSK9 levels were similar between the groups 
investigated. 
Figure PK02: Mean (SD) concentration-time curves for evolocumab after single-dose 
administration of 140 mg SC in hepatic impaired or healthy subjects 
As in the SmPC is recommended that no dose adjustment is considered necessary, the clinical relevancy 
of this diminished exposure in moderate impaired patients is not clear. Therefore, the efficacy in 
moderate and severe hepatic impaired patients is not warranted. This should be mentioned in the SmPC 
under 4.4. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis reveal that the gender, race, age, weight did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of evolocumab in a clinical significant way. 
Ctrough concentrations tended to be slightly lower in heavier subjects as estimated in population PK/PD 
analysis, but this did not result in PD differences based on reductions in LDL-C. In subjects with small 
body weight (40 kg), the model predicted AUCweek 8-12 was approximately 4-fold higher than is reference 
subject (male, 84 kg, no co-medications). The Applicant has submitted model predicted and observed 
evolocumab trough concentrations and LDL-C reductions. These data clearly demonstrates significant 
impact of body weight on evolocumab PK, but no apparent effect on PD. Therefore, the Applicant has 
reflected in the SmPC that body weight was significant covariate in pop PK analysis impacting evolocumab 
trough concentrations (section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following a single 420 mg intravenous dose, the mean (SD) systemic clearance was estimated to be 
12 (2) mL/hr. In clinical studies with repeated subcutaneous dosing over 12 weeks, dose proportional 
increases in exposure were observed with dose regimens of 140 mg and greater. An approximate two to 
three-fold accumulation was observed in trough serum concentrations (Cmin (SD) 7.21 (6.6)) following 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 37/122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
140 mg doses every 2 weeks or following 420 mg doses administered monthly (Cmin (SD) 11.2 (10.8)), 
and serum trough concentrations approached steady-state by 12 weeks of dosing. 
No time dependent changes were observed in serum concentrations over a period of 124 weeks. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment was considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from evolocumab clinical trials did not reveal a 
difference in pharmacokinetics of evolocumab in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment relative 
to non-renally impaired patients. Evolocumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment and this is reflected in the RMP and SmPC. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment was considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class 
A). Single 140mg subcutaneous doses of evolocumab were studied in 8 patients with mild hepatic 
impairment, 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects. The exposure to 
evolocumab was found to be approximately 40-50% lower compared to healthy subjects. However, 
baseline PCSK9 levels and the degree and time course of PCSK9 neutralisation were found to be similar 
between patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. This resulted in 
similar time course and extent of absolute LDL-C lowering. Evolocumab has not been studied in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) and this is reflected in the RMP and the SmPC. 
Body Weight  
Body weight was a significant covariate in population PK analysis impacting evolocumab trough 
concentrations, however there was no impact on LDL-C reduction. The week 12 trough concentration 
following repeat subcutaneous administration of 140 mg were in patients of 69 kg and 93 kg, 147% 
higher and 70% lower, respectively, than the trough concentration of the typical 81 kg subject. Less 
impact from body weight was seen with repeated subcutaneous evolocumab 420 mg monthly doses. 
Other special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age, race or 
gender. The pharmacokinetics of evolocumab was influenced by body weight without having any notable 
effect on LDL-C lowering. Therefore, no dose adjustments were considered necessary based on body 
weight.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro interaction studies were performed. This was considered acceptable; no interactions on the 
level of CYP co-enzymes or transporters were expected as evolocumab is a human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin.  
As evolocumab is not metabolised by specific enzymes, its potential for interaction is low. Only due to 
target mediated clearance by PCSK9 interaction on the level of PCSK9 concentrations (like statins) are 
considered of clinical significance.  
Statins do decrease the evolocumab exposure is a clinical significant way. Again this may be caused by 
the higher basal levels of PCSK9 and consequently higher initial clearance of evolocumab. In steady state 
this effect is diminished.  
Unbound levels of PCSK9 are sensitive to the type of lipid lowering agent in the presence of evolocumab. 
The effect of the increase in unbound PCSK9 is also reflected in lower unbound concentration of 
evolocumab after administration of the same lipid lowering compound but not on the percent change in 
LDL-C from baseline. 
These effects can be extrapolated to concomitant use with fibrates but as fibrates do have a similar effect 
on PCSK9 it can be expected that the unbound concentrations of evolocumab will not differ significantly 
compared to co medication with statins. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Evolocumab binds selectively to PCSK9 and prevents circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. 
Increasing liver LDLR levels results in associated reductions in serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A single SC or IV phase 1 proof-of–concept first in human study conducted in 56 healthy subjects as 
shown below (Figure PD01 and PD02), showed that the dose response for decrease in unbound PCSK9 
over time after dosing correlated well with dose responses for a decrease in LDL-C. Complete suppression 
of PCSK-9 was found for doses of 70 mg or more with longer suppression found with higher doses. This 
translated in larger reduction in LDL-C for the higher 210 and 420 mg doses with apparently no difference 
for the 420 mg SC and 420 mg IV doses.

Multiple dosing with evolocumab (see Table PD01 and Figure PD03) resulted in dose-dependent 
decreases in LDL-C on top of statin treatment. The dose level of statins did not impact the 
pharmacodynamic response to evolocumab in terms of LDL-C and PCSK9 reduction as these were similar 
when comparing subjects on low- to moderate-dose statin therapy versus subjects on high-dose statin 
therapy receiving the same evolocumab dose regimen. Likewise, the diagnosis of HeFH did not impact the 
pharmacodynamics response to evolocumab following similar comparison.

In multiple-dose studies (phase II study 20090158, 20090159, 20101154, and 2010115), temporal 
changes in LDL-C and unbound PCSK9 serum concentrations were observed in both the Q2W and QM 
regimens and were characterized by a return toward baseline at the end of the dosing interval. 
Furthermore, as expected from a regimen with more frequent dosing, the Q2W regimen resulted in less 
return toward baseline for LDL-C at the end of the dosing interval than the QM regimen (Figure PD05).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In study 20080397, evolocumab as a single dose of 21 mg and 420 mg was administered via SC and IV 
route. Absolute bioavailability after SC administration was approximately 10% and 55%, for 21 mg and 
for 420 mg dose, respectively. Hence, at clinically relevant doses bioavailability after SC route is 
approximately 50%, similar to other monoclonal antibodies. 
Drug substance for phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies was initially manufactured by Process 1. Drug 
substance for the majority of the phase 3 studies was manufactured by Process 2. The commercial drug 
substance will be manufactured using Process 2. Bioequivalence studies 20110168 and 20120133 were 
conducted with different devices, but evolocumab in all treatment arms was manufactured by Process 2. 
Both bioequivalence studies were conducted using evolocumab manufactured by Process 2. Some phase 
1 and 2 studies were conducted using evolocumab manufactured by Process 1. The Applicant did submit 
comparative data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics from the OLE Study 20110110 where 
subjects transitioned from Process 1 to Process 2 with sufficient evidence of comparability. These data 
were further supported by comparative data from population PK analysis. Hence, bridging of clinical data 
between Process 1 and 2 products was considered acceptable. 
The volume of distribution was 3-4 L indicating that evolocumab is greatly confined to the blood 
compartment. Evolocumab is eliminated via 2 mechanisms: one mechanism that predominates at low 
doses (< 140 mg SC) and becomes saturated at higher doses (≥140 mg SC). The saturable 
target-mediated clearance is likely related to evolocumab binding to PCSK9 and elimination of the 
antibody-PCSK9 complex. The nonsaturable mechanism of evolocumab elimination is likely nonspecific 
catabolism in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The mean clearance for evolocumab 420 mg IV 
(Study 20080397) was 11.6 mL/hr which is approximately 1.5-fold greater than values reported for 
natural Ig (clearance of 6.0 to 8.4 mL/hr). This represents both linear (associated with the clearance 
processes and rates for natural immunoglobulins) and nonlinear (associated with the PCSK9 target) 
contributions to the total clearance of unbound evolocumab. Population PK model predicted effective 
half-life for 140 mg SC Q2W was 11.4 days, and the model predictive effective half-life for 420 mg SC QM 
was 16.8 days. 
In population PK analysis multiple SC doses of evolocumab ≥ 140 mg SC Q2W resulted in nearly dose 
proportional increase in the AUC from week 8 to week 12 (AUCwk8-12), but the PK was higher than dose 
proportional for fixed doses of 70 to 140 mg SC Q2W.  
At repeated administration, evolocumab demonstrated 2 to 3 fold accumulation as evidenced by 
measured trough and maximal concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies. Steady state was achieved by 
week 12 with no apparent differences in the PK between subjects with primary hyperlimidemia/mixed 
dyslipidemia and subjects with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. 
In healthy subjects with normal baseline LDL-C evolocumab at single dose of 140 mg SC exhibited highly 
variable pharmacokinetics as evidenced by intrasubject CV% for Cmax 32% and for AUClast 45%, 
whereas pharmacodynamic effects were less variable with intrasubject CV% for the reductions in LDL-C 
7.5%. 
Antibodies have a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Therefore no in vitro and in vivo 
drug interaction studies and they are not are considered necessary at this moment. 
In patients on high dose statin, the systemic exposure of evolocumab was slightly lower than in subjects 
on low-to-moderate dose statin (ratio of AUClast 0.74), but this did not seem to affect PD of evolocumab 
based on the LS mean LDL-C and PCSK9 AUCs. Slightly lower systemic exposure in patients on high dose 
statin could be due to statin induced increases in PCSK9.

In line with pharmacokinetics of other IgG type monoclonal antibodies, renal impairment does not affect 
evolocumab elimination based on population PK analysis. 
Interestingly, in subjects with hepatic impairment the systemic exposure of evolocumab was lower than 
in healthy subjects (ratio of AUClast 0.5 to 0.6 in mild to moderate impairment), most likely due to 
differences in target-mediated clearance. Differences in the Cmax were smaller (LS mean Cmax values 
were 21% and 34% lower). This resulted in lower LDL-C reductions (ratio of AUECday1-57 approximately 
0.8 in both mild and moderate group). No differences in PCSK9 levels were seen, in line with complete 
inhibition of target as seen already at lower evolocumab doses.  
Gender, race and age had no impact on the PK and PD of evolocumab. Ctrough concentrations tended to 
be slightly lower in heavier subjects as estimated in population PK/PD analysis, but this did not result in 
PD differences based on reductions in LDL-C. 
No apparent difference in the systemic exposure of evolocumab was seen in patients with HeFH and 
without HeFH on low-to-moderate dose statin. No apparent differences in LDL-C and PCSK9 reductions 
were seen between the 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg Q1M, but the duration of action was longer in the higher 
dose group, supporting less frequent dosing with the higher dose.   
The decreases in mean LDL-C values were dose-related. Mean nadirs as low as 40 to 44 mg/dL were 
reached at approximately study day 22 (in the 420 mg SC group and the 420 mg IV group), with 
subsequent returns to near baseline by approximately study day 71. In the 210 mg dose group and in the 
420 mg groups (SC or IV), mean unbound PCSK9 decreased within hours after dosing to values below the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (15 ng/mL), remained below the LLOQ until study day 11, and 
subsequently returned to or toward baseline. The dose response for decrease in unbound PCSK9 over 
time after dosing correlated well with the dose responses for decreases in LDL-C. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proof of concept of evolocumab in inhibition of PCSK9, as measured by a decrease in unbound PCSK9, 
and the subsequent decrease in LDL-C has sufficiently been demonstrated. Reduction in LDL-C has both 
been demonstrated in healthy subjects after a single dose of evolocumab as well as in 
hypercholesterolemia patients on stable statin therapy after multiple dose administration of evolocumab.  
No significant difference in LDL-C or PCSK9 reduction was observed when comparing subjects on 
high-dose statin therapy receiving evolocumab versus subjects on low- to moderate-dose statin therapy 
receiving the same evolocumab dose regimen at any time point during the study. In addition, 
heterogenous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) status also had no effect on the evolocumab 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. 
In addition to LDL-C reduction, multiple dosing with evolocumab resulted in decreased mean total 
cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and increased HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I, while no significant effect in TG 
levels were observed. Evolocumab was well tolerated by healthy subjects and patients after a single 
intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) dose, and after repeated SC doses.  
The incidence of anti-evolocumab binding antibodies was low and did not appear to influence the PK and 
PD of evolocumab. Furthermore, results from population PK and PD analyses support clinical use of the 
proposed 140 mg SC Q2W or 420 mg SC QM dosing regimens.

This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of 
evolocumab administered SC for 12 weeks in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed 
dyslipidemia. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 8 treatment groups: evolocumab SC Q2W (70 mg, 105 
mg, or 140 mg), evolocumab SC QM (280 mg, 350 mg, or 420 mg), placebo Q2W, or placebo QM. The 
primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC Q2W or QM, compared with 
placebo, on percent change from baseline in UC LDL-C when used in addition to a statin with or without 
ezetimibe in subjects with hyperlipidemia.

Study 20090158 (RUTHERFORD-1) 
This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of evolocumab in 
subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Subjects were on a stable dose(s) of statin and 
other allowed lipid-regulating drugs for at least 4 weeks before LDL-C screening. Subjects were 
randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: evolocumab SC QM (350 mg or 420 mg) or placebo SC QM. The 
primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC QM, compared with placebo, 
on percent change from baseline in UC LDL-C in subjects with HeFH. Secondary objectives were 
comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on other lipid parameters, and pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
Study 20090159 (GAUSS-1) 
This was a phase 2, multi center, double-blind (except open-label ezetimibe), randomized, placebo- and 
ezetimibe-controlled study of evolocumab administered SC for 12 weeks in subjects with primary 
hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia who were statin-intolerant. Subjects had tried at least 1 statin and 
were unable to tolerate any dose or an increase in statin dose above total weekly maximum doses of 
statins specified in the protocol due to intolerable myopathy. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 5 
treatment groups: evolocumab SC QM (280 mg, 350 mg, or 420 mg); evolocumab 420 mg SC QM and 
ezetimibe 10 mg oral (PO) daily (QD); or placebo SC QM and ezetimibe 10 mg PO QD. The primary 
objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC QM, compared with ezetimibe, on 
percent change from baseline in UC LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic subjects unable to tolerate an 
effective dose of a statin. Secondary objectives were comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on other 
lipid parameters, and pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
Study 20101154 (MENDEL-1) 
This was a phase 2, multi center, randomized, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled, dose ranging study of 
evolocumab in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia and a 10-year Framingham 
risk score of 10% or less. Subjects were randomized into 1 of 9 treatment arms: evolocumab SC Q2W (70 
mg, 105 mg, or 140 mg); evolocumab SC QM (280 mg, 350 mg, or 420 mg); ezetimibe 10 mg PO QD; 
placebo SC (Q2W or QM). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of 
evolocumab SC administered Q2W or QM, compared with placebo, on percent change from baseline in UC 
LDL-C when used as monotherapy in hyperlipidemic subjects with a 10-year Framingham risk score of 
10% or less. Secondary objectives were comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on other lipid 
parameters, and pharmacokinetic evaluation. The overall study results for phase 2 studies for LDL-C 
lowering effect of evolocumab are provided in Table E03 below.

The company has conducted several studies in different type of patients. Adequate separation between 
different patients types have been made for evaluation in separate studies. Clinical evaluation has been 
conducted in controlled studies for 12 weeks. However, patients were subsequently enrolled in long term 
follow up studies, which were considered adequate to evaluate longer term effects in terms of efficacy and 
safety. 
Methods 
Study participants  
Studies have been conducted in the following patients groups: 
• 
Primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
o 
o 
In combination with statins 
In statin intolerant subjects 
o  As monotherapy 
• 
Familial Hypercholesterolemia (severe FH and HoFH) 
Patient populations were defined in the evolocumab clinical program as follows: 
Primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia are defined by 
elevated LDL-C only (primary hyperlipidemia) or elevated LDL-C along with high triglycerides or low 
HDL-C (mixed dyslipidemia). Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is defined by the 
diagnostic criteria outlined by the Simon Broome Register Group (Scientific Steering Committee, 1991). 
Nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia is the more common form of primary hypercholesterolemia where 
genes interact with dietary and other lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, sex, and age. 
Additional definitions for primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia populations evaluated include 
the following: 
-  Mixed dyslipidemia defined as triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L]), triglycerides (≥ 200 mg/dL 
[2.3 mmol/L]) or HDL-C (< 40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L] in males or < 50 mg/dL [1.3 mmol/L] in females). 
-  Severe hypercholesterolemia defined as a calculated LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L) while 
receiving a statin at screening or ≥ 240 mg/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L) without statin therapy. 
HoFH was defined as familial or inherited defect leading to severe elevations in cholesterol. 
In the placebo-controlled studies, subjects were either on physician optimized background statin therapy 
(Studies 20101155, 20090158, 20110231, 20110117), randomized background statin therapy per 
protocol (Study 20110115), or risk-based optimized background lipid-lowering therapy per protocol 
(Study 20110109).  
In the phase 2 Study 20090159, statin intolerance was defined as the inability to tolerate at least 1 statin 
at any dose, or an increase in statin dose above a total weekly maximum due to intolerable myopathy (ie, 
myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis), and having a history of symptom improvement or resolution with 
statin discontinuation. In phase 3 Study 20110116, the definition of statin intolerance was modified to 
include a history of being intolerant to at least 2 statins. 
Subjects for whom a statin is not considered clinically appropriate (eg, patients on fibrates, cyclosporine, 
certain CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as certain HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors,

clarithromycin, and itraconazole, and patients with statin hypersensitivity) were not directly evaluated in 
this program due to small population, the Applicant believes the monotherapy placebo controlled studies 
to support the efficacy of evolocumab in this population.

Inclusion criteria seemed generally appropriate with generally fasting LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L and at CHD 
risk (for MENDEL-2 this was low CHD risk), this was >4.0 mmol/L in the LAPLACE-2 for patients not taking 
already a statin, and >2.0 mmol/L in the long term DESCARTES study, in hypercholesterolaemia and 
mixed dyslipidaemia patients. 
For statin-intolerant patients, subjects had a history of statin intolerance as evidenced by both of the 
following (per subject or physician report): 
a.  Tried at least 2 statins and was unable to tolerate any dose or increase statin dose above the total 
weekly maximum doses due to intolerable myopathy, ie, myalgia (muscle pain, ache, or 
weakness without CK elevation), myositis (muscle symptoms with increased CK levels), or 
rhabdomyolysis (muscle symptoms with marked CK elevation); 
b.  Symptoms resolved or improved when statin dose was decreased or discontinued. 
Patients with HoFH should have been genetic confirmed or a clinical diagnosis based on a history of an 
untreated LDL cholesterol concentration greater than 13 mmol/L together with either xanthoma before 10 
years of age or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents, LDL>3.4 mmol/L. 
For the long term study this was diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia and LDL> 2.6 mmol/L (and 
high CHD risk). 
Exclusion criteria were generally poorly controlled or newly diagnosed diabetes; NYHA class III or IV; 
uncontrolled serious cardiac arrhythmia; uncontrolled hypertension; hypo/hyperthyroidism; severe 
hepatic impairment; eGFR < 30mL/min/1.73m2; ALT/AST > 2 x ULN; creatine kinase (CK) > 3 x ULN; 
myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass, or 
stroke within 3 months prior to randomization; and malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancers, 
cervical in-situ carcinoma, breast ductal carcinoma in situ, or stage 1 prostate carcinoma) within the last 
5 years.   
The studies included a range of patients’ representative of the target population and the subject selection 
was appropriate for the efficacy evaluation. Controlled hypertensive and diabetic patients were allowed to 
be enrolled. The very elderly were excluded from the studies, which is contrary to the EMA Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders (EMA/CHMP/748108/2013) 
recommendations. The definition of the statin intolerance in the phase 3 study was according to the CHMP 
Guideline.

Treatments 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Efficacy was evaluated in each individual study as well as in a prospective integrated efficacy analysis of 
the 4 pivotal, 12-week, phase 3 studies in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
(Studies 20110114, 20110115, 20110116, and 20110117). The integrated analysis also evaluated 
efficacy of evolocumab in 4 subpopulations of the primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
indication.

In the study OSLER-2, subjects who completed a qualifying evolocumab protocol and did not discontinue 
IP in the parent study for any reason, including an adverse event, were eligible for this study. All subjects 
who entered the study kept the same subject identification number from the parent study. Each site that 
participated in this study was assigned a different site number from that of the parent study. Subjects 
were randomized 2:1 after the parent study’s end-of-study (EOS) visit to receive either evolocumab and 
standard of care or standard of care alone. Sites were encouraged to have the day 1 OLE visit occur within 
30 days of completion of the parent EOS laboratory visit. If the day 1 OLE visit did not occur within 30 
days of completion of the parent EOS laboratory visit, then all end of parent study laboratory procedures 
had to be repeated prior to OLE study entry in order to confirm eligibility. After week 48 all subjects 
received open-label evolocumab for approximately 1 year.

Figure E09. Study Design and Treatment Schema Phase 3 (TAUSSIG: 20110271) 
The designs of the MENDEL-2, GAUSS-2 and RUTHERFORD-2 studies were very similar and were 
considered appropriate. The run-in period of a maximum of 6 weeks was sufficient to establish a stable 
run-in cholesterol level and to study the randomized comparison of evolocumab versus placebo or 
ezetimibe for MENDEL-2 and evolocumab versus ezetimibe in GAUSS-2 and evolocumab versus placebo 
on a maximum background therapy (statin with or without ezetimibe)(RUTHERFORD-2). A 12 week 
period with the 2 doses evaluated in the dose findings studies was considered appropriate to provide 
reasonable results on the LDL-C (and other cholesterol parameters) lowering effect of evolocumab. Two 
of the six and one of the three dosings for Q2W and QM were in a non-clinical setting, which is acceptable, 
considering that patients have to be able to administer evolocumab also in a home setting. 
For the LAPLACE-2 study a run-in period of 4 weeks was considered appropriate to establish a stable 
run-in cholesterol level and to evaluate the effect of evolocumab on top of different doses of different 
statins during 12 weeks of treatment. It was considered essential to study the effect of evolocumab on 
maximum doses of the most potent statins as has been done in this study. 
A 2:1 randomization was used for the controlled studies, which was considered appropriate. 
Screening of 4 to 16 weeks in the DESCARTES study of patients with a range of CV risk, LDL level and prior 
statin therapy were appropriate. The controlled effect of evolocumab for a longer follow up of 52 weeks 
could be evaluated in this study.  
Patients assigned to one of the 4 parent studies could be assigned to be included in the OSLER-2 study to 
be randomized according to evolocumab treatment of Q2W 140 mg or QM 420 mg and compared to a

background therapy in the first year and open label in the second year. The open-label design was 
acceptable, considering the long term follow up.  
In the HoFH population part A of the TESLA study was appropriate for a first exploratory evaluation of 
evolocumab in this population. Study TESLA B was 12 weeks placebo controlled, which provided a better 
understanding of the effect of evolocumab on cholesterol reduction than part A. In the longer term 
TAUSSIG study patients could be uptitrated according to response to a Q2W dosing scheme on the 
highest dose instead of QM dosing scheme on the highest dose. 
Objectives 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Study 20110114 (MENDEL-2) 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC Q2W or QM, 
compared with placebo and ezetimibe, on percent change from baseline in reflexive LDL-C in 
hyperlipidemic subjects with a 10-year Framingham risk score of 10% or less.  Secondary objectives were 
comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on other lipid parameters, and LDL-C goal attainment. 
Study 20110115 (LAPLACE-2) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC administered Q2W or QM 
when used in combination with a statin, on percent change from baseline in reflexive LDL-C compared 
with placebo and ezetimibe. Secondary objectives were comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on 
other lipid parameters, and LDL-C goal attainment.  
Study 20110116 (GAUSS-2) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC Q2W and QM, compared 
with ezetimibe, on percent change from baseline in reflexive LDL-C in hyperlipidemic subjects unable to 
tolerate an effective dose of a statin.  Secondary objectives were comprised of safety and tolerability, 
effect on other lipid parameters, and LDL-C goal attainment. 
Study 20110117 (RUTHERFORD-2)

Study 20120138 (OSLER-2) 
The primary objective was to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of 
evolocumab. The secondary objective is to characterize the efficacy of long-term administration of 
evolocumab as assessed by LDL-C. 
Study 20110271 (Severe FH Subjects) (TAUSSIG) 
The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of 
evolocumab. The secondary objective is to characterize the efficacy of long-term administration of 
evolocumab as assessed by reflexive LDL-C and other lipid parameters. 
HoFH patients 
Study 20110233 (TESLA) 
The primary objective of the phase 2 portion was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab SC QM 
on percent change from baseline in UC and calculated LDL-C in HoFH subjects.  Secondary objectives 
were comprised of safety and tolerability, effect on other lipid parameters, pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamic evaluation. 
Long-term Efficacy: Study 20110271 (HoFH Subjects) (TAUSSIG) 
The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of 
evolocumab. The secondary objective is to characterize the efficacy of long-term administration of 
evolocumab as assessed by reflexive LDL-C and other lipid parameters. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
“Mean percent change in LDL-C at weeks 10 and 12” and “the percent change in LDL-C at week 12” were 
used as co-primary endpoints in Phase 3 studies. The mean percent change from baseline at weeks 10 
and 12 in LDL-C and other lipid parameters was considered representative of the time-averaged effect 
and characterized LDL-C reduction and other lipid parameters better than the percent change at week 12 
alone. 
Analyses of LDL-C in the evolocumab clinical development program utilized 3 different methods: (1) 
preparative ultracentrifugation (UC) LDL-C, (2) a reflexive approach, and (3) calculated LDL-C. In the 
phase 2 studies, UC LDL-C values were used for the analysis of the primary endpoint to achieve the most 
rigorous and accurate LDL-C assessment possible for dose rationale and safety evaluations. Following 
phase 2, a reflexive testing approach was evaluated in order to assess whether calculated LDL-C 
concentrations could be used in place of UC LDL-C concentrations in the primary analysis. In this analysis, 
calculated LDL-C values < 25 mg/dL, < 40 mg/dL, or < 50 mg/dL were replaced with the corresponding 
UC LDL-C values. Results demonstrated that calculated LDL-C at a cut off value of 40 mg/dL using the 
reflexive approach was highly correlated with UC LDL-C concentrations. 
For analyses of the individual phase 3 parent studies and integrated phase 3 data related to LDL-C, unless 
specified otherwise, a reflexive approach was used, where the calculated LDL-C was employed unless the 
calculated LDL-C was < 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) or triglycerides were > 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L), in 
which case UC LDL-C was determined and utilized. This approach was chosen to provide a robust, 
conservative, and accurate assessment of LDL-C in the rigorous environment of a controlled clinical

study. In order to provide data to physicians on the efficacy of evolocumab under conditions which will 
likely be utilized in clinical practice, analysis of the percent change in LDL-C was also evaluated using only 
calculated LDL-C values. 
The absolute and percent change from baseline in ApoB, total cholesterol/HDL-C, total cholesterol, 
non-HDL-C, Apo B/Apo A1, Lp(a), triglycerides, VLDL-C, HDL-C, and ApoA1 were also incorporated as 
secondary, tertiary, or exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
The percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 12 was used as the primary efficacy endpoint in the 
controlled HoFH Study 20110233; however, mean LDL-C reduction at week 6 and 12 was added as a 
secondary endpoint instead of as a co-primary endpoint. The same other lipid parameters (ApoB, total 
cholesterol/HDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, Apo B/Apo A1, Lp(a), triglycerides, VLDL-C, HDL-C, and 
ApoA1) were evaluated in this population as well. 
The primary endpoints were considered appropriate to establish the LDL-C lowering effect of evolocumab 
at 12 weeks of treatment and to account for the time dependent effect using the mean of the 10-12 weeks 
LDL-C lowering effect. The methods of calculated and UC LDL-C were also considered appropriate. 
Sample size 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Phase 2 and 3 represents a total of total of 6026 patients, who received either any control or evolocumab. 
HoFH patients 
Phase 2 and 3 represents a total of 96 patients who all received evolocumab. 
Severe FH 
Phase 3 represents a total of 102 patients who all received evolocumab. For exact sample sizes in the 
different phase 3 studies see Table S04 and S05. 
Randomisation 
In phase 3, eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (evolocumab or placebo) on the 
basis of a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by the applicant before the start of the 
study. Randomization could be stratified on the basis of screening LDL-C serum concentration. A site 
representative used an IVRS to assign a randomization number and group to the subject. A subject was 
considered randomized into the study after undergoing randomization procedures by IVRS. 
Blinding (masking) 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
All subjects, investigators, and the sponsor investigative staff were blinded to treatment assignments 
with the exception of ezetimibe therapy, which was provided in tablet form and was self-administered 
daily by mouth. The sponsor staff members who were involved in randomization and biological sample 
management were unblinded to treatment assignment information, but they did not have access to 
subject-level data from the clinical trial database. The ezetimibe treatment group was not blinded 
because it was provided in tablet form and was self-administered daily by mouth as opposed to SC 
injection in cases of AMG 145 and placebo groups.

HoFH patients 
Phase 2 (Open-label Pilot): Phase 2 of the study was an open-label, single-arm pilot study; blinding was 
not utilized. Phase 3 (Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled): To maintain blinding in phase 3, 
evolocumab and placebo were provided in identical presentations. The site was unblinded to a subject’s 
treatment assignment only when knowledge of the treatment was essential for the subject’s safety or for 
further medical management of the subject. No subject was unblinded to IP assignment. The external 
independent DMC members and Independent Biostatistical Group had access to unblinded subject data 
per the DMC charter. Amgen PK scientists and the programmer(s) preparing the population 
PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) datasets had access to the treatment assignments and limited subject level 
data. To maintain study integrity, these Amgen staff members were not within the evolocumab study 
team. 
General blinding principles were considered appropriate.

Results 
Participant flow 
3152 subjects from 24 countries in Europe (52.2%), North America (40.4%), and Asia Pacific (7.5%) 
were randomized in the 4 phase 3 parent studies, and randomization within each country was balanced 
across treatment groups.  
Of the 3152 subjects randomized, 3146 (99.8%) subjects received IP and were included in the FAS: 
−  1848 evolocumab (921 evolocumab SC Q2W, 927 evolocumab SC QM) 
−  821 placebo (411 placebo SC Q2W, 410 placebo SC QM) 
−  477 ezetimibe (240 ezetimibe [placebo SC Q2W], 237 ezetimibe [placebo SC QM]) 
3005 (95.3%) completed IP, 3026 (96.0%) subjects completed the study and 69 (2.2%) subjects 
discontinued the study early, not including the 57 (1.8%) subjects who enrolled into extension studies 
without completing the final follow-up visit in the parent studies.

Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
In each parent study, the primary efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which 
included all randomized subjects who had received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Of the 3152 
subjects randomized, 3146 (99.8%) subjects received IP (investigational product) and were included in 
the FAS: 
• 1848 evolocumab (921 evolocumab SC Q2W, 927 evolocumab SC QM) 
• 821 placebo (411 placebo SC Q2W, 410 placebo SC QM) 
• 477 ezetimibe (240 ezetimibe [placebo SC Q2W], 237 ezetimibe [placebo SC QM]) 
HoFH patients 
Thirty three patients in the placebo controlled study and 99 patients in the long term HoFH study were 
analysed.

Outcomes and estimation 
LDL-C reduction of approximately 55% to 75% was achieved with evolocumab as early as week 1 and 
maintained during long-term therapy. Maximal response was generally achieved within 1 to 2 weeks after 
dosing with 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly.  
Evolocumab reduced LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B, TC, Lp(a), VLDL-C, TG, TC/HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1and 
increased HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia. Evolocumab was superior to ezetimibe in reducing 
LDL-C, TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, Lp(a), TC/HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1. 
The clinical relevance, including the long-term safety, of sustained very low levels of LDL C (i.e., < 0.65 
mmol/L [< 25 mg/dL]) have not yet been established. 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
•  Combination with a statin and statin with other lipid-lowering therapies  
LAPLACE-2: Evolocumab significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 
compared with placebo for the rosuvastatin and simvastatin groups and compared with placebo and 
ezetimibe for the atorvastatin group (p < 0.001).  
RUTHERFORD-2: Evolocumab significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 
compared with placebo (p < 0.001). 
•  Statin intolerant patients 
GAUSS-2: Evolocumab significantly reduced LDL-C compared with ezetimibe (p < 0.001). 
• 
Treatment in the absence of a statin 
MENDEL-2: Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 compared 
with both placebo and ezetimibe (p < 0.001).

Long term effect  
Evolocumab demonstrates a long-term reduction in LDL-C as expressed in the figures below for the 
different phase 2/phase 3 open label long term ongoing studies.  
DESCARTES: Evolocumab 420 mg once monthly significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline at 52 weeks 
compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Treatment effects were sustained over 1 year as demonstrated by 
reduction in LDL-C from week 12 to week 52(-59% LDL-C reduction with the 420 mg QM dose at 52 weeks 
versus standard of care) . Reduction in LDL-C from baseline at week 52 compared with placebo was 
consistent across background lipid-lowering therapies optimised for LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. 
Evolocumab significantly reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a), 
and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 at week 52 compared with placebo (p < 0.001). 
OSLER and OSLER-2 are two ongoing, randomised, controlled, open-label extension studies to assess the 
long-term safety and efficacy of evolocumab in patients who completed treatment in a ‘parent’ study. A 
total of 1324 patients enrolled in OSLER. Evolocumab 420 mg once monthly significantly reduced LDL-C 
from baseline at week 12 and week 52 compared with control (nominal p < 0.001). Treatment effects 
were maintained over 124 weeks as demonstrated by reduction in LDL-C from week 12 in the parent 
study to week 112 in the open-label extension. A total of 2928 patients enrolled in OSLER-2. Evolocumab 
significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline at week 12 compared with control (nominal p < 0.001). 
Treatment effects were maintained as demonstrated by reduction in LDL-C from week 12 to week 24 in 
the open-label extension. Evolocumab significantly reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C,

ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a) , and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 from baseline to week 52 in OSLER 
and to week 24 in OSLER-2 compared with control (nominal p < 0.001). LDL-C and other lipid parameters 
returned to baseline within 12 weeks after discontinuation of evolocumab at the beginning of OSLER or 
OSLER-2 without evidence of rebound.

hypercholesterolaemia, including homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. A total of 102 severe 
familial hypercholesterolaemia patients and 96 homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia patients 
enrolled in TAUSSIG. Patients could be uptitrated after 12 weeks according to response to a Q2W dosing 
scheme on the highest dose instead of QM dosing scheme on the highest dose and could be downtitrated 
during the study as well. Long-term use of evolocumab demonstrated a sustained treatment effect as 
evidenced by reduction of LDL-C in patients with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia. Patients on 
apheresis showed slightly less effect. The highest Q2W dose showed slightly increased effect compared to 
the QM dose. The limited number of adolescent patients showed similar effect as the overall adult 
population.  
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
TESLA: Evolocumab 420 mg once monthly, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, 
bile-acid sequestrants), significantly reduced LDL C and ApoB at week 12 compared with placebo (p < 
0.001). 
In TAUSSIG, long-term use of evolocumab demonstrated a sustained treatment effect as evidenced by 
reduction of LDL-C of approximately 20% to 30% in patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia not on apheresis and approximately 15% to 25% in patients with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia on apheresis.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy on LDL-C reduction was substantial for the pivotal trials according to Q2W and QM dose, as 
presented below, for both components of the primary endpoint, the mean LDL-C reduction from week 10 
and 12, and the LDL-C reduction at week 12. Reflexive LDL-C is a combination of calculated LDL-C and UC 
measurement when LDL-C drops below 40 mg/dL. The method of measurements seems to be 
approximately similar. In addition, the data were supported by other lipid parameters in both study 
groups.

Supportive studies 
Study YUKAWA-1 
This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of evolocumab in 
Japanese subjects with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia and high cardiovascular risk. 
Subjects were randomized into 1 of 6 treatment groups: evolocumab SC Q2W (70 mg or 140 mg); 
evolocumab SC QM (280 mg or 420 mg); or placebo SC (Q2W or QM) to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks 
of SC evolocumab administered Q2W or QM, compared with placebo, on percent change from baseline in 
UC LDL-C when used in addition to statin therapy. Mean (SD) serum concentration of UC LDL-C at 
baseline was 141.8 (20.9) mg/dL (3.7 [0.5] mmol/L). Compared with placebo, evolocumab resulted in 
statistically significant reductions in LDL-C at week 12 when administered Q2W (-57 to -72%) and QM 
(-60% to -66%). Evolocumab Q2W and QM also showed statistically significant improvement in 
secondary lipid endpoints.   
Other Studies – Home- Use Setting 
Study THOMAS-1 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, study designed to assess subjects’ ability to administer a 
full dose of evolocumab SC in a home-use setting using either a PFS or an AI/pen.  Eligible subjects with 
primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia on statin therapy with or without ezetimibe were 
randomized to receive evolocumab 140 mg SC Q2W for 4 weeks (day 1, week 2, and week 4) for a total 
of 3 administrations (the first performed in the clinic and 2 subsequent self-administrations performed at 
home) via PFS or AI/pen. The percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline to week 6 was clinically equivalent 
between the PFS and AI/pen groups. Treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 29.3% and 
27.0% of subjects in the PFS and AI/pen groups, respectively.  Overall, 3 (2.0%) subjects discontinued IP 
due to adverse events, including 2 (2.7%) in the PFS group and 1 (1.4%) in the AI/pen group.  No subject 
tested positive for anti-evolocumab antibodies. 
Study THOMAS-2 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, study designed to assess subjects’ ability to administer a 
full dose of evolocumab in a home-use setting using either an AMD or 3 AI/pens. Eligible subjects with 
primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia on statin therapy with or without ezetimibe were 
randomized to receive evolocumab 420 mg SC QM for 8 weeks (day 1, week 4, and week 8) for a total of 
3 administrations (the first performed in the clinic and 2 subsequent self-administrations performed at 
home) via AMD or 3 AI/pens. The percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline at the mean of weeks 10 and 
12 was clinically equivalent between the AMD and AI/pen groups. Treatment emergent adverse events 
Assessment report

were reported in 25.6% and 32.9% of subjects in the AMD and AI/pen groups, respectively. One (1.2%) 
subject in the AI/pen group discontinued IP due to an adverse event.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
General 
The company has conducted several studies in different type of patients. The objectives of the presented 
studies were considered in line with the claimed indications. Studies are conducted in patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia on top of maximum statin therapy, statin intolerant 
patients, and patients also using ezetimibe. The criteria applied to identify statin intolerant patients were 
considered sufficiently rigorous with patients who had to try at least 2 statins and be unable to tolerate 
them based on adverse events which resolved or improved when statin dose was decreased or 
discontinued. Clinical evaluation has been conducted in controlled studies for 12 weeks. The primary 
endpoints were considered appropriate to establish the LDL-C lowering effect of evolocumab at 12 weeks 
of treatment and to account for the time dependent effect using the mean of the 10-12 weeks LDL-C 
lowering effect. Patients were subsequently enrolled in long term follow up studies, partly in a controlled 
fashion, which seems adequate to evaluate longer term effects in terms of efficacy and safety.  
Analyses of LDL-C in the evolocumab clinical development program utilized 3 different methods: (1) 
preparative ultracentrifugation (UC) LDL-C, (2) a reflexive approach, and (3) calculated LDL-C. The 
methods used to analyse the LDL-C were considered appropriate. The randomisation and the general 
blinding principals were considered appropriate. Ezetimibe and the 2QW and QM differentiation in dosing 
have not been blinded, but this was considered unfeasible, as ezetimibe is a tablet and the dosing interval 
cannot be mimicked. Appropriate secure blinding principles of measurements and evaluation were applied 
for assessment of laboratory values by an independent laboratory and an external independent 
monitoring committee to review the safety data to avoid a possible increased risk. The statistical methods 
used were considered appropriate. The objective to also evaluate other lipid parameters was agreed to be 
supportive and provided a good understanding of the evolocumab effect. An important limitation of the 
presented data was the lack of clinical outcome data and these were agreed to be provided 
postauthorisation. Although LDL-C reduction was considered an established surrogate marker for 
cardiovascular risk reduction, this is primarily been demonstrated for statin therapy and not for newer 
therapies such as evolocumab treatment. 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
The designs of the MENDEL-2, GAUSS-2 and RUTHERFORD-2 studies were similar and were considered 
appropriate. The run-in period of a maximum of 6 weeks was sufficient to establish a stable run-in 
cholesterol level and to study the randomized comparison of evolocumab versus placebo or ezetimibe for 
MENDEL-2 and evolocumab versus ezetimibe in GAUSS-2 and evolocumab versus placebo on a maximum 
background therapy (statin with or without ezetimibe)(RUTHERFORD-2). A 12 week period with the 2 
doses evaluated in the dose findings studies was sufficient to provide data regarding the LDL-C (and other 
cholesterol parameters) lowering effect of evolocumab. Two of the six and one of the three doses for Q2W 
and QM were tested outside the clinical settings, which were acceptable, considering that patients have to 
be able to administer evolocumab also in a home setting. For the LAPLACE-2 study a run-in period of 4 
weeks was considered appropriate to establish a stable run-in cholesterol level and to evaluate the effect 
of evolocumab on top of different doses of different statins during 12 weeks of treatment. It was 
considered essential to study the effect of evolocumab on maximum doses of the most potent statins as 
has been done in this study. A 2:1 randomization was used for the controlled studies, which was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 81/122 
 
 
 
 
 
considered appropriate. Screening of 4 to 16 weeks in the DESCARTES study of patients with a range of 
CV risk, LDL level and prior statin therapy was considered appropriate. The controlled effect of 
evolocumab for a longer follow up of 52 weeks was evaluated in this study. This period was agreed to be 
minimal for a intended life-long treatment. Patients assigned to one of the 4 parent studies were 
afterwards included in the OSLER-2 long term study where they were randomized according to 
evolocumab treatment of Q2W 140 mg or QM 420 mg and compared to a background therapy in the first 
year and studied open label in the second year. The open-label design was considered acceptable, given 
the long term follow up.  
HoFH population 
Studies were presented with the objective to demonstrate controlled as well as long term effect of 
evolocumab in patients with HoFH. Due to the small number of patients available, hard outcome studies 
were less feasible, but outcome data derived from other studies may provide indication of the predicted 
effect in this HoFH population. Part A of the TESLA study was considered appropriate for a first exploratory 
evaluation of evolocumab in this population. Study TESLA B was 12 weeks placebo controlled, which 
provided a better understanding of the effect of evolocumab on cholesterol reduction than part A. In the 
longer term TAUSSIG study patients could be up-titrated and back-titrated according to response to a 
Q2W dosing scheme on the highest dose instead of QM dosing scheme on the highest dose. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase 2 dose evaluation 
In the phase 2 evaluation several doses have been investigated in different patient populations. In all 
studies a dose dependent effect was observed for the treatment of evolocumab for both the Q2W dosing 
and the QM dosing in comparison to the control group. In those studies where both the Q2W and the QM 
dosing were tested, the LAPLACE study on top of statin therapy showed a slightly better efficacy for the 
Q2W dosing when comparing the 140 Q2W dose with the 420 QM dose, while in MENDEL-1 versus 
placebo, the 420 mg QM was slightly more effective except on top of ezetimibe where the Q2W 
demonstrated higher efficacy. In the other studies only QM dosing was tested and a dose dependent 
effect was demonstrated. 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
In the studies including hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia patients, there was a high 
proportion of patients (around 95%) completing these studies. An acceptably low number of patients was 
lost to follow-up or discontinued the study due to withdrawal of consent or other reasons. The “parent” 
studies were multicenter and recruited patients across the globe, which was also judged to be sufficiently 
representative for the European population. Overall baseline data for the hypercholesterolaemia and 
mixed dyslipidaemia patients was sufficiently well distributed across the different treatment groups, with 
some slight imbalances for some of the characteristics. For instance, LDL-C levels were slightly higher in 
the evolocumab treatment arms in comparison to placebo and slightly lower in comparison to the 
ezetimibe randomised patients. This could have slightly influenced the results. All studies included 
substantial number of patients with high cardiovascular risk, except the monotherapy study due to ethical 
reasons. 
Evolocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in the co primary endpoint of: “mean percent change 
in LDL-C at weeks 10 and 12” and “the percent change in LDL-C at week 12” for both the Q2W 140 mg 
dose and the 420 mg QM dose in a consistent fashion across all of the pivotal phase 3 studies evaluating 
different patients including high risk CV patients, HeFH patients, and patients at low CV risk. On top of 
placebo or on top of standard of treatment a reduction of between 60 and 70 percent was demonstrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 82/122 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared to patients who were treated with ezetimibe, evolocumab demonstrated a less reduction of 
around 40% across the 3 pivotal studies on top of SoC, statin intolerant patients, and on top of placebo.  
Primary endpoint analyses were supported by the secondary cholesterol profile evaluations showing 
significant reductions in e.g. ApoB, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C and triglycerides and increase in HDL-C. 
In addition, the effect of LDL-C reduction was maintained as compared to SoC up to 48 to 64 weeks of 
treatment and in an open label single-arm fashion up to 124 weeks, although the studies are still ongoing 
and limited data have been evaluated for this long time frame. For the severe FH population, reduction of 
approximately 40% in LDL-C was sustained during 48 weeks of treatment in the interim analysis. These 
data were generally supported by beneficial effects in the secondary cholesterol parameters.  
The pooled analyses demonstrate a substantial and comparable efficacy between the 140 mg Q2W dosing 
and the 420 QM dosing both in terms of LDL-C reduction over time (mean Week 10 and 12) as well as 
LDL-C reduction at the week 12 endpoint. This was similar for both comparisons: against placebo as well 
as against ezetimibe. The used method of reflexive LDL-C measurement seems not substantially differ 
from the calculated LDL-C measurement method when the overall data are considered. 
The applicant presented the data of the number of patients older than 65 and 75 in the safety information. 
A substantial proportion of patients was older than 65. This subgroup does not show a difference in 
efficacy compared to younger patients. However, patients over 75 of age were underrepresented, 
although similar efficacy was demonstrated in this subgroup as well. Other subgroup analyses also 
demonstrated no major differences in effect. 
The study in a Japanese patients also demonstrate efficacy in this patient population. In addition, both the 
study THOMAS-1 and THOMAS-2 demonstrated a comparable efficacy for different administration 
formulations of AMD, PFS, and the AI/pen in a home setting. Therefore it was considered acceptable to 
combine results from studies using different formulation in performed analyses. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
HoFH patients 
A high proportion of patients completed TESLA phase 3 study. Currently, an acceptable high proportion of 
patients are on study drug (approximately 90%) in the long term study (TAUSSING) with a slightly 
smaller proportion of patients who are on study drug and on apheresis and for paediatric patients 
(approximately 83%). Most discontinuations were due to physician decision. Although the number of 
patients with HoFH included in the studies is limited, distribution across the treatment group and placebo 
group appears to be acceptable. Despite baseline values for LDL-C and PCSK9 were slightly different 
between the treatment and the placebo groups, this was still considered acceptable. Similar differences 
also appeared in the long term follow-up studies across the categories of apheresis, non-apheresis and 
patients <18 years, however, patients were not randomised across these categories. Approximately half 
of the patients had a HoFH mutation and half were compound HeFH (with a different mutation in each 
allele). The number of patients with HeFH remained very limited in the controlled phase 3 study. The 
applicant made a distinction between patients with a defective LDL receptor and with a negative or 
undetermined LDL-R receptor in HoFH population. Efficacy in the defective LDL-R population was weaker 
as compared to the negative or undetermined LDL-R population. In the small group of patients with HoFH 
younger than 18 years of age (n=14) evolocumab showed approximately similar efficacy as compared to 
adult patients.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, evolocumab demonstrated efficacy as measured by substantial and consistent reduction in 
LDL-C and other lipid parameters on top of existing therapy options for both patient groups: (1) of 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, and subgroups of those, and (2) for patients with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition, limited data have been provided for adolescents 
showing consistent results. Ongoing long term studies provide data regarding maintenance of effect in 
the long term. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical safety profile includes data from 16 phase 2 and phase 3 studies: 12 studies that were ~12 
weeks in duration and 4 studies that were long term studies (a 52 week completed study [20110109] and 
3 ongoing extension studies [20110110, 20120138 and 20110271). Some of the data have been updated 
from safety data of 01 April 2014 to 01 July 2014. 
Three integrated analysis sets are used to describe the data from the primary hyperlipidemia 
(heterozygous familial and non-familial) and mixed dyslipidemia studies: 
•  The Integrated Parent Analysis Set (IPAS) comprises integrated data from the phase 2 and phase 
3 parent studies, all being controlled blinded studies, i.e. the 12 week studies 20101154, 
20101155, 20090158, 20090159, 20110114, 20110115, 20110116, 20110117, 20120348, 
20120356, and 20110231 and the 52 weeks study 20110109.  
•  The Integrated Extension Standard of Care (SoC) Controlled Period Analysis Set (IECAS) 
comprises integrated data from year 1 (the controlled period) of the open label extension (OLE) 
studies 20110110 and 20120138. 
•  The Integrated Extension All Investigational Product (IP) Period Analysis Set (IEAAS) comprises 
integrated data from year 2+ (the all IP period) of the open label extension studies 20110110 
and 20120138.  
Exposure data are presented below for both the primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) and mixed dyslipidemia studies, as well as the more limited data of the HoFH population.

Neurocognitive adverse events 
Neurocognitive adverse events analyses were performed for the LDL-C subgroups. In the LDL C < 25 
mg/dL (< 0.6 mmol/L) subgroup, 2 evolocumab subjects reported amnesia. In the LDL-C < 40 mg/dL (< 
1.0 mmol/L) subgroup, 3 subjects reported amnesia, 1 subject reported disorientation, 1 subject reported 
mental impairment, and 4 subjects reported memory impairment; all 9 subjects were in an evolocumab 
treatment group. However, there was no overall difference in neurocognitive adverse events with the 
LDL-C < 25mg/dL and LDL-C<40 mg/dL subgroups compared with LDL-C≥ 40 mg/dL. 
Vitamin E 
Analyses of vitamin E in the long-term studies (20110109, 20110110, 20120138) were performed by LDL 
C subgroups (< 25 mg/dL [< 0.6 mmol/L], < 40 mg/dL [< 1.0 mmol/L], or ≥ 40 mg/dL [≥ 1.0 mmol/L]).  
The analyses were overall consistent across the LDL-C subgroups. 
Steroid Analytes 
Analyses of steroid analytes were performed by LDL-C subgroups (< 25 mg/dL [< 0.6 mmol/L], < 40 
mg/dL [< 1.0 mmol/L], or ≥ 40 mg/dL [≥ 1.0 mmol/L]).  The analyses were overall consistent across the 
LDL C subgroups (data not shown). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Muscle adverse events 
Given the concerns with statins, muscle events were monitored throughout the evolocumab clinical 
program. In the controlled blinded studies, adverse events for the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue 
Disorders system organ class were reported in 581 (14.7%) subjects in the any evolocumab group and 
284 (13.7%) subjects in the any control group, of which the most common adverse events in the any 
evolocumab group and any control group were back pain (3.0% and 2.7%), myalgia (2.5% and 2.6%), 
and arthralgia (2.3% and 2.2%). Serious events in this system organ class were reported in 9 (0.2%) and 
in 2 (0.1%) subjects in the any evolocumab and any control group, respectively. Back pain was the only 
serious adverse event in this system organ class to be reported in > 1 subject during the parent studies 
(3 subjects in the any evolocumab group). 
To examine cases of CK elevation most likely to represent clinically meaningful muscle events, subjects 
were identified who had normal baseline CK levels, a post baseline CK elevation > 5 x ULN, and a 
concurrent muscle related adverse event.  There were 51 subjects with CK elevation > 5 x ULN (normal 
at baseline) and 613 subjects with an adverse event from the HLGT “Muscle Disorders.” Of those 
identified subjects, 6 subjects had both a muscle adverse event and an elevated CK.  Four of these 6 
subjects were on evolocumab treatment (2 myalgia, 1 muscle spasms, and 1 myositis) and 2 were on SoC 
(2 muscle spasms).  Of the 4 cases occurring during treatment with evolocumab, evolocumab was 
continued in all but 1 subject, who was participating in the statin intolerance study (20090159).  In 5 of 
the 6 cases for which post peak CK values were available, serum CK rapidly improved. For the other 
subject (on statin only), the final reported CK level was the peak CK. Creatinine was normal for all 6 
subjects at the time of and post CK elevation. One of the 6 events was reported by the site as likely due 
to hard physical labor preceding the CK elevation (subject on evolocumab only), and in 2 other subjects 
the adverse event duration did not overlap the CK elevation (1 subject on evolocumab plus statin and 1 
on statin only). Of the other 3 subjects, 2 were treated with statins. 
Hepatic adverse events 
In the controlled blinded studies, adverse events for the hepatobiliary disorders system organ class were 
reported in 13 (0.3%) subjects in the any evolocumab group and 9 (0.4%) subjects in the any control 
group, of which the most common adverse events in the any evolocumab group and any control group 
Assessment report

were cholelithiasis (0.1% and 0.2%), hepatic steatosis (0.1% and < 0.1%), and biliary colic (0.1% and 
0%). Serious adverse events for this system organ class were reported in 4 (0.1%) subjects in the any 
evolocumab group (cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and biliary tract disorder) and 2 (0.1%) subjects in the 
any control group (cholecystitis acute, drug-induced liver injury).  
In the year 1 SoC controlled period, 15 (0.5%) subjects and 8 (0.6%) subjects reported an adverse event 
for this system organ class in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC alone group, respectively. The 
most common adverse events in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC alone group were hepatic 
steatosis (0.2% in both groups), cholelithiasis (0.1% and 0.2%), and hepatic function abnormal (0.1% 
and 0%). Three (0.1%) subjects and 1 (0.1%) subject reported a serious adverse event in the 
evolocumab plus SoC group (cholelithiasis, hepatic function abnormal, and hepatotoxicity) and SoC alone 
group (bile duct stone and cholecystitis chronic), respectively. In the year 2+ OLE period, 9 (0.9%) 
subjects reported an adverse event, of which most common adverse event was cholelithiasis (0.3%). Five 
(0.5%) subjects reported a serious adverse event, including biliary dyskinesia, cholecystitis, and 
cholecystits acute. No HoFH subjects in Studies 20110233 or 20110271 reported an adverse event in the 
hepatobiliary disorders system organ class. 
Diabetes 
Since diabetes related adverse events have been observed with statins, broad and narrow search 
strategies were used to assess safety risks with evolocumab therapy. The incidence of diabetes events 
was low in the controlled blinded studies (any evolocumab: 0.9%; any control 0.8%), the year 1 
SoC-controlled period (evolocumab plus SoC: 2.1%; SoC alone: 1.6%), and the year 2+ OLE period 
(1.8%). Additional analyses were performed to evaluate adverse events, HbA1c levels, fasting blood 
glucose levels, and proteinuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, or neither 
type 2 diabetes nor metabolic syndrome at baseline. 
Changes in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose in the controlled blinded and the extension studies were 
similar and were also comparable across treatment groups within the analysis periods.  
There were no differences in adverse events, HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose levels, and proteinuria 
in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, or neither type 2 diabetes nor metabolic 
syndrome at baseline. 
Renal adverse events 
In the controlled blinded studies, adverse events for the Renal and Urinary Disorders system organ class 
were reported in 58 (1.5%) subjects in the any evolocumab group and 24 (1.2%) subjects in the any 
control group, of which the most common adverse events in the any evolocumab group and any control 
group were hematuria (0.3% and 0.3%), nephrolithiasis (0.3% and 0.1%), and pollakiuria (0.2% and 
0.1%).  Serious adverse events for this system organ class were reported in 4 (0.1%) subjects in the any 
evolocumab group (glomerulonephritis acute, glomerulonephritis minimal lesion, iga nephropathy, and 
renal failure acute) and no subjects in the any control group. 
In the year 1 SoC-controlled period, 47 (1.7%) subjects and 29 (2.0%) subjects reported an adverse 
event in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC alone group, respectively. The most common 
adverse events in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC alone group were hematuria (0.4% and 
0.2%) and nephrolithiasis (0.2% and 0.4%). Six (0.2%) subjects and 1 (0.1%) subjects reported a 
serious adverse event in the evolocumab plus SoC group (nephrolithiasis, urinary incontinence, Calculus 
Ureteric, and renal failure acute) and SoC alone group (renal failure acute), respectively. In the year 
2+OLE period, 22 (2.3%) subjects reported an adverse event, and the most common adverse event was 
nephrolithiasis (0.7%). Two (0.2%) subjects reported a serious adverse event (nephrolithiasis).

For HoFH in study 20110271, 3 (3.1%) HoFH subjects reported adverse events.  Hematuria was the only 
adverse event reported in > 1 subject; and in 1 of the 2 subjects who reported it, the adverse event of 
hematuria was reported as serious. 
Treatment related adverse events 
Treatment related AEs in the parent studies are provided below. No evolocumab related adverse event 
was reported in > 1% of subjects in the any evolocumab group.  Myalgia was the only adverse event 
reported in > 1% of subjects in the any control group (33 [0.8%] any evolocumab, 22 [1.1%] subjects 
any control. No trends in the incidences of adverse events related to IP were observed between the any 
evolocumab and any control groups.

For the extension controlled period, the treatment related AEs were substantially higher for evolocumab 
vs control (n=283 (9.5%) vs 4 (0.3%)), which could be exposure related, as the subjects randomised to 
SoC did not receive evolocumab in the first year. In the 2 years extension period 4.2% of treatment 
related AEs were observed. 
Device Related Adverse Events  
Data from clinical studies demonstrate that all 3 subcutaneous (SC) presentations (ie, prefilled syringe 
[PFS], autoinjector/pen [AI/pen] and automated mini doser [AMD]) evaluated during the evolocumab 
clinical development program exhibited device related adverse events that were uncommon, mostly 
grade 1, and generally limited to injection site reactions. 
The AI/pen was used in the phase 3 parent studies. Across the controlled blinded phase 3 device studies, 
fewer than 3% of subjects reported a device related adverse event. The overall incidence of device related 
adverse events across treatment groups were 1.5% in evolocumab 140 mg Q2W; 2.8% in evolocumab 
420 mg QM, 0.8% in placebo Q2W, and 2.6% in placebo QM. The large majority of device related adverse 
events were related to the injection site (i.e., injection site bruising, injection site erythema, and injection 
site pain). Most devices related adverse events were grade 1 in severity. Furthermore, there were no 
serious or unexpected device related adverse events reported in clinical studies of evolocumab. 
In the year 1 SoC-controlled period, thirty seven (1.9%) subjects reported device related adverse events 
in the evolocumab plus SoC group. All 37 subjects were in the evolocumab group because subjects 
assigned to SoC alone did not receive any placebo injections. Most devices related adverse events were 
grade 1 in severity.

During the year 2+ OLE period, 17 subjects received evolocumab via AI/pen in study 20120138, and no 
device related adverse events were reported. 
Two phase 3, evolocumab clinical home-use studies (20120348 and 20120356) assessed the effective 
administration of evolocumab by subjects or caregivers in the home use setting (self-administration) 
using the 3 different SC presentations (PFS, AI/pen, and AMD) and showed consistent results with the 
safety profile across the evolocumab program. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the controlled blinded studies, serious adverse events were reported in 110 (2.8%) subjects in the any 
evolocumab group and 43 (2.1%) subjects in the any control group (Table S08). The incidence of serious 
adverse events between the evolocumab 140 mg Q2W group (36 [2.9%] subjects) and the 420 mg QM 
group (59 [3.0%] subjects) was similar. In the year 1 SoC controlled period, serious adverse events were 
reported in 153 (5.4%) subjects in the evolocumab plus SoC group and 82 (5.8%) subjects in the SoC 
alone group (Table S09). In addition, serious adverse events were reported in 76 (8.0%) subjects in the 
year 2+ OLE period (Table S10).

For the HoFH studies, there were no serious adverse events in part A or part B of study 20110233. Seven 
(7.3%) subjects reported a serious adverse event in study 20110271, of which six occurred after 
enrolment from the parent study (Table S11). Additionally, for the severe FH subjects, one subject 
(1.0%) a serious adverse event (uterine prolapse).

The data showed a reduction in the cumulative incidence and relative risk of all cause death, myocardial 
infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, coronary revascularisation, stroke or transient ischemic 
attack, or hospitalisation for heart failure with evolocumab, and excludes evidence of cardiovascular harm 
with an observed hazard ratio (95% CIs) of 0.50 (0.29, 0.86). The median exposure in this analysis was 
approximately 11 months and number of cardiovascular events was 52. 
Deaths 
Overall, 15 deaths were reported (n=12 in subjects who ever received evolocumab and n= 3 in subjects 
who received placebo and/or SoC).  Six deaths occurred during the controlled blinded studies (n=4 
(0.1%) for evolocumab and n=2 (0.1%) in SoC; 2 deaths occurred after the end of the parent study), 7 
deaths occurred during the year 1 SoC controlled period (n=3 (0.1%) for evolocumab and n=4 (0.3%) in 
SoC), 2 deaths occurred during the year 2+ OLE period. All deaths were reviewed and adjudicated by the 
Clinical Endpoint Committee and as cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular deaths. A total of 11 deaths 
were deemed to be cardiovascular. Only 1 death in a 69 year old subject (11521012010 of Study 
20120138) was reported by the investigator as related to IP. The investigator reported the cause as 
unknown, but presumed it to be myocardial infarction.

There were no deaths reported in the HoFH studies, including severe FH subjects. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver and renal function laboratory findings were balanced between treatment groups within the 3 
analysis periods. Changes in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose in the integrated parent and the integrated 
extension studies were similar and were also comparable across treatment groups within the analysis 
periods. The incidence of potential hepatitis C was low in the year 1 SoC-controlled period (evolocumab 
plus SoC: 0%; SoC alone: 0.1%) and the year 2+ OLE period (0.1%). Of the 94 subjects identified at risk 
for HCV and tested for HCV antibody, 9 subjects had confirmed positive antibody tests. In those 9 
subjects, LFTs were all < 2 x ULN. A total of 3 subjects had measurable HCV RNA on day 1 or subsequent 
visits: two of them transaminase levels remained < 2 x ULN; the third subject (10966402015) had mildly 
elevated LFTs from day 1. No HCV infection events were noted for any HoFH subject. Concentrations of 
overall vitamin E and vitamin E normalized to total cholesterol were evaluated in the long-term study 
(20110109), the phase 2 OLE study (20110110), and the phase 3 OLE study (20120138, only when UC 
LDL-C was < 25 mg/dL [< 0.6 mmol/L]). The serum total vitamin E decreased in the evolocumab group 
compared with control. This decrease in serum total vitamin E reflected the evolocumab-mediated 
decrease in total cholesterol, which is responsible for the transport of vitamin E. When serum total vitamin 
E was normalized by total cholesterol, the normalized serum total vitamin E was unchanged.

Pediatric HoFH Subjects 
A total of 14 adolescent subjects (≥ 12 to < 18 years), all of whom were HoFH, were enrolled into Studies 
20110233 and 20110271 of the evolocumab clinical program. All adolescent subjects from 20110233 with 
the exception of 1 adolescent subject in part B continued in the 20110271 extension study. Three 
additional adolescent subjects who did not participate in the 20110233 parent study were enrolled into 
Study 20110271 as well.  
Analyses of adverse events were performed according age ≥ 12 to < 18 years (Table S14) or ≥ 18 years. 
While the number of HoFH subjects precludes detailed analyses, the overall pattern of adverse events in 
HoFH adolescents is consistent with that seen in adult HoFH subjects and subjects with primary 
hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In the subgroup of adolescent subjects, adverse events were 
reported in 3 (42.9%) subjects in the evolocumab group and 2 (66.7%) subjects in the placebo group, 
and no preferred term was reported for > 1 adolescent subject in either treatment group.

Immunological events 
General findings 
In the controlled blinded studies, adverse events for the Immune System Disorders system organ class 
were reported in 20 (0.5%) subjects in the any evolocumab group and 14 (0.7%) subjects in the any 
control group. The most common adverse events in the any evolocumab group and any control group 
were seasonal allergy (0.4% and 0.5%) and hypersensitivity (0.1% and 0.1%). In the year 1 
SoC-controlled period, 31 (1.1%) subjects and 12 (0.8%) subjects reported an adverse event for the 
Immune System Disorders system organ class in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC alone

group, respectively. The most common adverse events in the evolocumab plus SoC group and the SoC 
alone group were seasonal allergy (0.7% and 0.5%) and hypersensitivity (0.2% in both groups). In the 
year 2+ OLE period, 22 (2.3%) subjects reported an adverse event in this system organ class, and the 
most common adverse event was seasonal allergy (1.6%). For HoFH, no subjects in study 20110233 
reported an adverse event in the Immune System Disorders system organ class In study 20110271, 1 
(2.4%) HoFH subject (who did not participate in the 20110233 parent study) reported a non-serious 
adverse event of seasonal allergy in this system organ class. 
Anti-evolocumab antibody formation 
Across 6026 subjects of the evolocumab clinical program of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed, 15 
subjects (from all subjects tested and including pre-existing antibodies) tested positive for binding 
antibodies (Table S16).  
No HoFH subject (0 out of 80) developed anti-evolocumab antibodies after receiving at least 1 dose of 
evolocumab. Two HoFH subjects tested positive for pre-existing anti-evolocumab binding antibodies at 
baseline (prior to receiving evolocumab). 
Based on a review of adverse events for the subjects with binding antibodies, there were no adverse 
events (ie, hypersensitivity) determined to be due to the presence of a binding antibody. No serious 
adverse events were temporally associated with a positive antibody result.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies on potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions were conducted with evolocumab due to the 
fact that no PK drug-drug interactions are expected with evolocumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the controlled blinded period, adverse events leading to discontinuation of IP were reported in 75 
(1.9%) subjects in the any evolocumab group and 48 (2.3%) subjects in the any control group. The only 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of IP (any evolocumab and any control groups, respectively) 
occurring in ≥ 0.2% subjects in the any evolocumab group or the any control group were myalgia (0.3% 
and 0.5%), nausea (0.2% and 0.1%), and dizziness (0% and 0.2%). In the year 1 SoC-controlled period, 
58 (2.0%) subjects in the evolocumab plus SoC group reported an adverse event leading to 
discontinuation. During this period, the only adverse events leading to discontinuation of IP occurring in 
≥ 0.2% subjects in the evolocumab plus SoC group was myalgia (0.2%). In the year 2+ OLE period, 10 
(1.0%) subjects reported an adverse event leading to discontinuation of evolocumab, while no adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of IP occurred in ≥ 0.2% subjects. 
In the HoFH studies, 1 (2.4%) HoFH subject discontinued study treatment due to a grade 3 adverse event 
of rash.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A substantial number of 6026 subjects were exposed to any dose of evolocumab representing 5246 
patient-years of exposure, with 3549 evolocumab dosed subjects for at least 6 months, 2458 for at least 
12 months, and 1124 evolocumab for 2 years or more. This was mainly attributable to patients with 
primary hyperlipidaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) and mixed dyslipidemia. In terms of 
numbers this was sufficient according to guideline recommendations and considering that evolocumab 
may be used as a life-long treatment. In addition, sufficient number of patients treated with evolocumab 
(compared to subjects on placebo or standard of care) was evaluated to be able to identify evolocumab 
related safety effects, observed in the controlled pivotal studies and in 1 year controlled follow-up. 
However, safety data in patients with HoFH were far more limited due to the rarity of the condition, 
with 8 subjects with a mean exposure of 18 months, 33 patients included in the 12 weeks phase 3 study 
and 99 patients included in the still ongoing long term study. This resulted in 81 HoFH subjects who 
received evolocumab for at least 3 months and 56 HoFH subjects for at least 6 months.  
Overall, evolocumab displays a safety profile similar to that of the control treated (51.1% vs 49.6%) 
groups. The most common adverse events were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache and back pain, which occurred at approximately similar incidence in both evolocumab and 
control treatment groups (5.9% vs 4.8%, 3.2% vs 2.7%, 3.0% vs 3.2% and 3.0% vs 2.5% in the 
controlled studies, respectively). The frequency was only slightly different when separated according to 
placebo controlled data, evolocumab treatment on top of statins, or for statin-intolerant patients. Also, 
treatment related AEs in the “parent” studies were approximately similar. For the extension controlled 
period, the treatment related AEs were substantially higher for evolocumab vs control (n=283 (9.5%) vs 
4 (0.3%)), however the CHMP agreed with the applicant that this could be exposure related, as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 108/122 
 
 
  
 
 
 
subjects randomised to control did not receive evolocumab in the first year. For HoFH patients, an 
approximately similar safety profile was observed with nasopharyngitis, headache, and influenza being 
the most prominent adverse events observed. As expected in a population with very high cardiovascular 
risk, a high incidence of 4.2% of angina pectoris was reported. Incidence of adverse events in subjects on 
apheresis were comparable with subjects not on apheresis (76.5% vs 75%, respectively).  
When considering longer treatment, overall frequency of adverse events increased slightly (51.1% for the 
controlled blinded studies, 60.3% during first year, and 74.7% during 2 years) with also a slightly higher 
incidence in the evolocumab group compared to the standard of care (60.3% vs 55.0% during first year). 
However, for the overall population, the annualized adverse event rate was comparable between the 
evolocumab and control groups in each period and the rates decreased over long-term treatment: 
integrated “parent” studies (any evolocumab: 90.8%; any control 89.7%), the year 1 standard of 
care-controlled period (evolocumab plus SoC: 77.6%; SoC alone: 71.6%), and the year 2+ open 
extension period (75.8%). The most common serious adverse events were myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris, pneumonia, osteoarthritis, and non-cardiac chest pain.  
Cardiovascular events and deaths were of major interest, as a harmful effect should at least be 
excluded prior to approval of medicinal products from the new pharmacological class according to the EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013). Overall the number of cardiovascular events was limited (n=103), although 
this was only slightly lower than the expected number of events to occur. A relative risk analysis based on 
the 1 year data of all cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, coronary 
revascularisation, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or hospitalisation for heart failure with 
evolocumab, excluded evidence of cardiovascular harm with an observed hazard ratio (95% CIs) of 0.50 
(0.29, 0.86). Therefore, these limited data cannot identify any possible harmful effect of evolocumab with 
respect to cardiovascular events. There were 15 deaths reported with the data cut off of 1 April 2014, of 
which 12 in the evolocumab treated patients. This seemed imbalanced; however, evolocumab was 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio versus placebo. Furthermore, in the pivotal studies, the incidences of deaths 
were similar in the evolocumab group versus control (0.1% each), and in the 1 year data, less deaths in 
the evolocumab group (0.1%) versus SoC (0.3%) were observed. Also, exposure to evolocumab was 
longer due to the open-label 2 years extension. Moreover, from the detailed descriptions of each death 
case, one cannot exclude that the underlying condition may have importantly contributed to death. 
Therefore, overall the data were reassuring and did not indicate any higher incidence of death that could 
be attributed to evolocumab treatment, although no firm conclusions could be made due to the limited 
number of deaths observed and the lack of long-term experience. 
Hardly any discontinuations during the studies were observed (1.9% vs 2.3% in the controlled blinded 
studies), with even more limited number of patients discontinuing due to adverse events (myalgia (0.3% 
and 0.5%), nausea (0.2% and 0.1%), and dizziness (0% and 0.2%), 2.0% during first year, and 1.0% 
(n=10) during 2 years).  
Specific attention was given to safety of different doses proposed for registration. The incidence in 
adverse events in 420 mg QM dose group was slightly higher compared with 140 mg Q2W group however, 
a similar pattern was also observed in Q2W and QM placebo groups. This could be mainly attributed to the 
longer term DESCARTES study using only the 420 mg QM dose. The prefilled autoinjector/pen 
(AI/pen) and prefilled syringe (PFS) were proposed for approval within this MAA. In phase 2 studies 
most of the subjects received the investigational product (IP) via vial and syringe and in the phase 3 
studies all subjects received IP via the AI/Pen (with the exception of the long term controlled DESCARTES 
study where subjects were exposed to the vial and syringe). A PK study showed that the 140 mg dose 
administered with the PFS was equivalent to evolocumab administered with the AI/pen from PK and 
clinical point of view. Device related adverse events were uncommon, mostly not severe, and generally 
limited to injection site reactions (injection site bruising, erythema and pain).

Of particular interest was whether patients achieving very low levels of LDL-C would display a different 
safety profile to patients with less low LDL-C levels achieved, in particular, as very low levels of LDL-C 
have been associated with increased risk of cancer, hemorrhagic stroke, non-cardiovascular death and 
neurocognitive abnormalities and could affect steroid production. Specific interest has been given to 
neurocognitive adverse events, vitamin E and steroid analytes in this respect. Overall, similar incidence of 
AEs was observed across each of the groups of subjects who achieved: LDL-C < 25mg/dL, LDL-C<40 
mg/dL or LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL during the controlled blinded studies as well as during 1 year treatment 
period. However the incidence of AEs was slightly higher in subjects who achieved LDL-C < 25mg/dL and 
LDL-C<40 mg/dL (82.4% and 77.3%), compared to subjects who achieved LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL (74.5%) 
in the 2 years treatment period. Some differences were found in the type of most frequently observed 
adverse events within each group of LDL-C achieved level, however without any clear pattern. No safety 
signal was identified regarding vitamin E and steroid analytes and these remained within the normal 
levels. Several neurocognitive adverse events in the < 25mg/dL and < 40mg/dL patients were reported, 
all in the evolocumab treatment group. However, the data cannot be considered controlled, as hardly any 
patients in the control group achieved these LDL-C levels, and thus meaningful comparisons to the control 
groups could not be made.  
Since evolocumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin, specific attention was given to 
anti-evolocumab antibodies. These were infrequent (n=15) and not associated with clinically relevant 
adverse events. In addition, no neutralizing antibodies were detected in any subject.  
Specific attention was given to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, hepatic disorders, renal 
disorders, and diabetes, as these are known to be associated with treatment with several lipid lowering 
agents. Evolocumab treatment did not show any effect on musculoskeletal disorders. A slightly higher 
incidences of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders was observed and was increasing over time 
(evolocumab vs control 14.7% vs 13.7% in controlled blinded studies, 19.1% vs 15.2% in 1 year and 
28.1% in 2 years). From the 51 subjects with CK elevation > 5x ULN and 613 subjects with a muscle 
related adverse event, 6 subjects had both a muscle adverse event and an elevated CK. Four of these 6 
subjects were on evolocumab treatment (2 myalgias, 1 muscle spasms and 1 myositis) and 2 were on 
standard of care (2 muscle spasms). However, no clear pattern could be identified among the type of 
adverse events observed. Moreover, such events could also likely to be related to the background statin 
therapy. Serious events related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were uncommon. In 
addition, no safety signal concerning creatine kinase has been identified in the HoFH subjects. No clear 
effect was observed with evolocumab concerning hepatic disorders or liver function tests, with a low 
and comparable incidence versus control: 0.9% vs 0.8% in controlled blinded studies, 1.1% vs 1.2% 
during 1 year and 1.4% during 2 years. Also, a specific phase 1 study in subjects with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment did not indicate any issues related to PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of evolocumab, 
as expected, as evolocumab is not metabolised by the liver. Overall, any evolocumab effect on renal 
disorders was limited with low and comparable to control adverse effects, which can be expected since 
evolocumab is not cleared by the kidneys. Some higher incidences for evolocumab were found in statin 
intolerant and diabetes patients; however, these could be confounded or explained by baseline 
differences. No effect on the incidence of diabetes or HbA1C was observed with evolocumab or in 
patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Also no patterns indicative of clinically important 
treatment related laboratory abnormalities in vitamin E, and steroid analytes were observed. 
Changes from baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not reveal clinically 
important differences among treatment groups.  
Safety according to age was also assessed, displaying more adverse events for longer term in the >75 
years age group in comparison to the overall population, although the numbers were small which made 
firm conclusion difficult.

The diagnosis of HeFH did not affect the safety profile of evolocumab. 
There is limited amount of data from the use of evolocumab in pregnant women and in women who are 
breast-feeding. As a result, as proposed by the applicant in the SmPC, evolocumab should not be used 
during pregnancy or during breast-feeding. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Fourteen adolescent patients were included in the studies of whom 8 patients were HoFH patients. A 
similar safety profile was observed in these patients, although number of patients was limited. To be more 
specific, adverse events were reported in 3 (42.9%) subjects in the evolocumab group and 2 (66.7%) 
subjects in the placebo group, and no preferred term was reported for > 1 adolescent subject in either 
treatment group.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Evolocumab displayed an acceptable safety profile comparable to that of the comparator therapy (placebo 
or standard of care), with very limited patients discontinuing treatment or showing serious adverse 
events. Any signs of a harmful effect on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality could not be clearly 
identified, while data on this were limited and were agreed to be provided in the post-authorisation phase. 
Safety in patients achieving very low LDL-C levels, mainly focused on neurocognitive adverse events, 
vitamin E and steroid analytes and was similar to patients who did not achieve very low LDL-C levels. Any 
antibody formation was very rare and not of any concern. Any substantial effects on known safety issues 
identified with known lipid lowering therapy such as liver disorders, renal disorders, diabetes and 
musculoskeletal disorders were not observed with evolocumab treatment. A limited number of 
adolescents was included in the study and displayed a similar safety profile. Similarly, HoFH patients also 
displayed a similar safety profile, although data were far more limited. Slightly more adverse events was 
observed in elderly patients (>75 age) although data was limited. Any safety differences between the 
Q2W and QM dosing were considered to be only marginal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Evolocumab is a first in class fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against human 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to 
the LDLR on the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. This leads to 
LDL-C reduction. The pharmacokinetics of evolocumab is similar to other human monoclonal antibodies. 
At low concentrations the elimination is target mediated by PCSK9 and at higher concentration by 
non-specific processes. The proposed indication for evolocumab includes patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, and patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), including treatment of adolescents.

Evolocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction of 60-70% versus placebo or on top of statins 
(including maximal doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) and of approximately 40% versus ezetimibe 
in the co-primary endpoints of: “mean percent change in LDL-C at weeks 10 and 12” and “the percent 
change in LDL-C at week 12” in patients with baseline LDL-C levels between 2.8-5.0 mmol/L. Efficacy was 
supported by significant and beneficial changes in other parameters of the cholesterol profile, i.e. 
triglycerides (- 15-20%), HDL-C (+ 6-8%) and also ApoB, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, total cholesterol, 
non-HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, Lp(a), and VLDL-C (with no significant reductions  in TG and VLDL-C 
vs ezetimibe). This efficacy in terms of reduction of LDL-C and other lipid parameters was consistent 
across the phase 2 (n=1359) and phase 3 studies (n=3146) (phase 3: LAPLACE-2, RUTHERFORD-2, 
GAUSS-2, and MENDEL-2) including high CV risk patients (47% across the different studies), 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) patients (n=331 in phase 3), and statin intolerant 
patients (n=307 in phase 3).  
The criteria applied to identify statin intolerant patients in GAUSS-2 study were rigorous as patients 
had to have tried at least 2 statins and be unable to tolerate statins based on adverse events which 
resolved or improved when statin dose was decreased or discontinued. A consistent effect on LDL-C 
reduction (of 38-39%) has been demonstrated versus ezetimibe therapy in these patients. 
Efficacy was found to be similar for the intended doses of 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM dose. The LDL-C 
effect of evolocumab was consistent in all subgroups, i.e. race, ethnicity, age, gender, region, glucose 
tolerance status, CV risk, statin intensity at baseline, and HDL-C. A comparable efficacy was found when 
the medicinal product was administered with different devices of automated mini-doser (AMD), prefilled 
syringe (PFS), prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen) in a home setting as separately analysed in two small 
studies (THOMAS-1 and THOMAS-2). 
A sustained effect of LDL-C reduction has been demonstrated up to 52-68 weeks in the ongoing long 
term studies [OSLER-1, OSLER-2, DESCARTES (completed)] including patients from the controlled 
blinded studies but also unique patients, with 1 year of controlled data. For the severe FH population, 
a reduction of approximately 40% in LDL-C was sustained during 48 weeks of treatment in the interim 
analysis. 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) population 
Evolocumab demonstrated an overall significant LDL-C reduction of 15-32% on top of standard of care 
in the co-primary endpoint of LDL-C reduction after 12 weeks or the mean of 10 to 12 weeks compared to 
standard of care in patients with baseline LDL-C levels of 8.3-11.4 mmol/L. The efficacy was supported by 
improvement in other lipid parameters (total cholesterol, ApoB, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C, 
and ApoB/ApoA1). The LDL-C reduction was sustained during 28 weeks of treatment for both patients on 
apheresis and not on apheresis, with evolocumab being slightly less effective in apheresis patients. The 
limited number of 14 adolescent HoFH subjects (age 12 to< 18 years) showed similar reductions in 
LDL-C (-21.5%) and changes in other lipid parameters compared with adult patients. Patients up titrated 
to the Q2W 420 mg dose demonstrated an additional decrease in lipid parameters compared to the QM 
dose (approximately 5%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
Efficacy has been demonstrated based on the reduction in LDL-C level, an established surrogate 
marker for CV disease but the outcome data were not available. The number of cardiac events was 
very low and no meta-analytic approach could be used to analyse the data in terms of CV outcome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 116/122 
 
 
  
 
 
Although similar efficacy of evolocumab was demonstrated in patients over 75 years of age, patients in 
this subgroup were underrepresented. 
HoFH population 
Efficacy data in the HoFH patients was based on only 96 patients included in the long term study, which 
may be considered limited, however, HoFH patients are rare. Also in this population, hard clinical 
outcome data are missing. The applicant distinguishes between patients with a defective LDL receptor 
and patients with a negative or undetermined LDL-R receptor for HoFH. It was confirmed that for patients 
with undetermined or negative LDLR some efficacy could be observed, although less than for patients 
with defective LDLR, since evolocumab has its mechanism of action through the LDLR receptor. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
Sufficient number of patients was evaluated for safety according to ICH guideline on the extent of 
population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of 
non-life-threatening conditions (ICH E1), including 6026 evolocumab dosed subjects for at least 6 
months, 2458 for at least 12 months, and 1124 evolocumab for 2 years or more. These were mainly 
patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. 
Evolocumab displayed a safety profile approximately similar to that of the control, (i.e. placebo, 
ezetimibe, or maximum statin therapy with or without ezetimibe). The incidence of AEs reported in the 
controlled blinded studies was 51.1% and 49.6% in the evolocumab and control treated group, 
respectively. Also, treatment related AEs in the “parent” studies were approximately similar. For the 
extension controlled period, the treatment related AEs were substantially higher for evolocumab vs 
control (n=283 (9.5%) vs 4 (0.3%)), however it was agreed with the applicant that this could be 
exposure related, as the subjects randomised to control did not receive evolocumab in the first year.The 
most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and back 
pain, which occurred at approximately similar incidence in both evolocumab and control treatment groups 
(5.9% vs 4.8%, 3.2% vs 2.7%, 3.0% vs 3.2% and 3.0% vs 2.5%, respectively). The frequency of 
adverse events was only slightly different when separated according to the different therapeutic settings, 
i.e. placebo controlled data, evolocumab treatment on top of statins, or for statin-intolerant patients. In 
statin intolerant patients, type and incidence of adverse events were comparable between evolocumab 
and control groups, with even slightly higher incidence of myalgia in control group patients during the 
controlled blinded period. The safety profile in severe HeFH patients is similar as for the whole population 
investigated. 
Evolocumab was well tolerated with very low number of discontinuations during the studies (1.9% in 
evolocumab vs 2.3% in controls in the controlled blinded studies). Even less patients discontinued due to 
adverse events (1.8%). This included myalgia (0.3% and 0.5%), nausea (0.2% and 0.1%), and dizziness 
(0% and 0.2%). An incidence of discontinuations of 2.0% and 1.0% during the first and 2 years of 
treatment were reported, respectively.  
A slightly higher incidence in adverse events in 420 mg QM (54.0%) compared with 140 mg Q2W 
(43.6%) of evolocumab was found; a pattern also observed in QM and Q2W dosing in placebo groups 
(54.6% and 41.0%). This was mainly attributed to the long term DESCARTES study where only the 420 
mg QM dose was used.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 117/122 
 
 
  
 
 
No safety signal was identified regarding changes from baseline for systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and heart rate did not reveal clinically important differences among treatment groups. 
Overall, a similar incidence of AEs was found across each of the subgroups of subjects who achieved very 
low levels of LDL-C (LDL-C < 25mg/dL, LDL-C<40 mg/dL) compared to the groups with normal levels 
(LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL) during the controlled blinded studies as well as during the 1 year treatment period. 
However, this was slightly higher (82.4% and 77.3% compared to 74.5%) in the 2 years treatment 
period. The incidence of neurocognitive adverse event, vitamin E and steroid analytes was 
consistent across patients reaching very low LDL-C levels (LDL-C < 25mg/dL, LDL-C<40 mg/dL) 
compared to normal levels (LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL), with vitamin E and steroid analytes remaining within 
normal levels. 
Evolocumab treatment was not associated with any apparent musculoskeletal AEs, adverse events 
known to be associated with existing lipid lowering therapies. Although, a slightly higher incidences of 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were observed over time (evolocumab vs control 14.7% 
vs 13.7% in the controlled blinded studies, 19.1% vs 15.2% in 1 year and 28.1% in 2 years), no clear 
pattern could be identified among the type of adverse events observed in the different safety analysis sets 
and events were also likely to be related to the background statin therapy and heavy physical activity. In 
addition, the incidence of CK elevation was comparable across the different treatment groups within the 
controlled blinded period and the 1 year treatment period. Serious events related to musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders were uncommon. 
Specific attention has also been given to hepatic disorders as such adverse events were also associated 
with the existing lipid lowering therapies. The incidence of hepatic disorders observed during the 
treatment with evolocumab was low and comparable with control patients (0.9% vs 0.8% in the 
controlled blinded studies, 1.1% vs 1.2% during 1 year and 1.4% during 2 years). A specific phase 1 
study in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment did not indicate any safety issues, which was 
expected as evolocumab is not metabolized by the liver. 
No effect on incidence of diabetes or HbA1C, suggested to be associated with statin therapy, was 
found for evolocumab. Also, no patterns indicate clinically important treatment related laboratory 
abnormalities in vitamin E, and steroid analytes. 
Since evolocumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin, specific attention was paid to the possibility of 
developing anti-evolocumab antibodies. The number of patient who developed anti-evolocumab 
antibodies was low (n=15) and his finding was not associated with clinically relevant adverse events. In 
addition, no neutralizing antibodies have been detected in any subject. 
Device related adverse events were uncommon, mostly not severe, and generally limited to injection 
site reactions (injection site: bruising, erythema and pain).  
HoFH patients 
An approximately similar safety profile compared to primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia 
studies was observed in HoFH subjects with nasopharyngitis, headache, and influenza being the most 
prominent adverse events observed. A similar safety profile as for adults was observed for the fourteen 
adolescent patients of whom 10 patients were included in the controlled 12 week HoFH study. Adverse 
events were reported in 3 (42.9%) HoFH subjects in the evolocumab group and 2 (66.7%) in the placebo 
group. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The number of cardiovascular events was 103 in 6026 patients, which was considered relatively low, but 
only slightly lower as compared to what may be expected. In the pivotal studies, a slightly higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 118/122 
 
 
  
 
percentage of subjects had positively adjudicated cardiovascular events of death (CV or non CV), MI, UA, 
and coronary revascularisation in the evolocumab group (25, 0.6%) compared with control (9, 0.4%), 
while in the year 1 controlled data this was 22[0.8%] versus 19[1.3%]. A relative risk analysis based on 
the 1 year data of these (extended) MACE events with evolocumab excludes evidence of cardiovascular 
harm with an observed hazard ratio (95% CIs) of 0.50 (0.29, 0.86).  
During the clinical development program, 15 deaths have been reported (with a cutoff date of 1 April 
2014), of which 12 were reported in the evolocumab treated patients. This seemed imbalanced, however, 
evolocumab was randomized in a ratio 2:1 versus placebo. Furthermore, in the pivotal studies, the 
incidence of death was similar in the evolocumab group versus control group (0.1% each), and in the 1 
year data less deaths in the evolocumab group (0.1%) versus standard of care (0.3%) were observed. 
Also, exposure to evolocumab was longer due to the open-label 2 years extension. Moreover, from the 
detailed descriptions of each death case, it appeared that the underlying condition may have importantly 
contributed to death. Therefore, overall data were reassuring and did not indicate a higher incidence of 
death that could be attributed to evolocumab treatment. 
Although, any evolocumab effect on renal function was considered limited and comparable to the renal 
adverse effects in the control group, a higher incidence in proteinuria in statin intolerant and diabetes 
subjects was noticed, however, it was agreed that these could be confounded or clarified by baseline 
differences. 
More adverse events were observed in the long term treatment of patients above 75 years of age (not 
for the controlled blinded data) in comparison to the overall population, although the numbers were small 
(n=23) which made firm conclusion difficult.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Evolocumab has demonstrated a substantial and consistent reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters 
alone and on top of existing therapy options including statins and ezetimibe in several groups of patients 
with hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia. These were considered to be clinically relevant effects as reduction in the 
LDL-cholesterol is an important surrogate marker with potential benefits in terms of cardiovascular 
outcome. MACE analyses did not indicate any trend towards cardiovascular harm. However, the actual 
impact of the long-term lipid reduction with evolocumab in terms of improved cardiovascular outcome 
was still missing and need to be addressed in the post-authorisation phase.  
Regarding safety, evolocumab displayed an acceptable safety profile with a comparable or slightly higher 
incidence of adverse events to that of the comparator therapy (placebo or standard of care), with very 
limited patients discontinuing treatment or showing serious adverse events. In addition, evolocumab 
treatment did not cause any major effects on known safety problems associated with existing lipid 
lowering therapies such as liver disorders, renal disorders, diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders.  
The long term studies provided data indicating maintenance of efficacy and safety, although the period 
was considered limited taking into account that intended evolocumab treatment could be lifelong. 
Cardiovascular events have been reported, but did not give rise to specific concern but also did not allow 
for any conclusions due to the limited numbers and limited duration of treatment.  
The method of administration of evolocumab (injections) did not give a rise to any safety issue and could 
be done in a home setting. A comparable efficacy was found across different devices, including the 
prefilled syringe (PFS) and prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen) in a home setting, of which the autoinjector 
was largely been used in the phase 3 studies.

Benefit-risk balance 
Evolocumab demonstrated a consistent and substantial beneficial effect on LDL-C in several patient’s 
groups (including patients at low cardiovascular risk, patients on maximum statin therapy, patients 
intolerant to statins and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] patients) with 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidemia, as well as for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(HoFH) patients on top of currently available therapies for LDL-C reduction. Evolocumab administered 
every 2 weeks or every month has an acceptable safety profile and is well tolerated, which is considered 
important for an intended life-long treatment. Thus, the benefit/risk balance is considered positive 
regarding the LDL-C lowering effect. However, duration of treatment was still limited and further data to 
be provided post-authorisation are considered necessary to assess long term safety and the occurrence of 
unexpected events. One major uncertainty remained on whether the substantial LDL-C reduction 
translates into cardiovascular mortality/morbidity benefit. An outcome study to address this issue 
post-authorisation is already ongoing. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The applicant conducted studies in patients in need for further LDL-C reduction based on their increased 
cardiovascular risk profile including patients on maximum statin therapy, patients intolerant for statins 
and HeFH/HoFH patients. Most of these patients have been well characterised. In particular, patients with 
statin intolerance were well defined. Across the different studies efficacy was found to be similar for the 
proposed doses of 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM.  
The increased cardiovascular risk was considered obvious in HeFH and HoFH patients due to the highly 
elevated LDL-C levels from early age that remained elevated throughout their lifetime even with 
aggressive available lipid lowering therapy. These patients are difficult to treat and available treatment 
options are limited (in particular for HoFH). They often require apheresis that is available in some 
specialised clinics only, time consuming and burdensome to the patient. Therefore, there was still an 
unmet medical need in these types of patients from an early age, which justifies that some adolescent 
patients were included in the current clinical development program. 
Also, for the limited number of HoFH patients investigated, evolocumab showed a consistent reduction in 
lipid levels, although less than in the population of patients with hypercholesterolaemia and mixed 
dyslipidemia, but still significantly beyond what could be achieved with current lipid lowering therapy 
options. This was also found in the 14 adolescent HoFH patients with a similar safety profile as in adults, 
justifying the approval of indication in these patients.  
Generally, included patients achieved LDL-C levels close to the recommended in the European clinical 
practice guideline (2011 ESC/EAS Guideline for the management of dyslipidaemias) and sometimes even 
lower. There is an ongoing discussion in the clinical community regarding the optimal treatment target 
and the concept of “the lower, the better”. In general, the opinion is shifting in the direction of treating 
patients to LDL-C levels as low as possible (2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood 
Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults), but the question of whether a 
so-called J-shaped curve may exist remained open. Clearly, with evolocumab very low levels of LDL-C 
(<40 mg/L) could be achieved in some patients. Although data did not indicate a higher incidence of 
adverse events compared to LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL in the 2 years treatment period, more data need to be 
collected on this important issue, in particular from the ongoing CV outcome study. This is also reflected 
in the agreed version of the RMP. In the past, with statins, concerns were raised of assumed increased risk 
when cholesterol would be lowered too much, including an increased risk for cancer, hemorrhagic stroke, 
non-cardiovascular death, neurocognitive abnormalities and alterations in steroid production, but these 
concerns have never been confirmed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/222019/2015 
Page 120/122 
 
 
  
 
 
As already concluded above, with regards to the safety profile of evolocumab, the CHMP did not identify 
any substantial safety issues and the incidence of adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients as 
compared to different background therapies was similar or slightly increased. Adverse events specifically 
known to be associated with existing lipid lowering therapy, including muscle related events, hepatic 
events, renal events and diabetes risk, have been closely monitored throughout the evolocumab 
development program, and did mostly not give rise to specific concerns. These issues certainly need to be 
investigated further in the post-authorisation programme as agreed within the RMP.  
Finally, an important limitation of the dossier is the lack of cardiovascular outcome data. Although 
reduction in LDL-C was considered to be a strong surrogate for cardiovascular risk reduction, this was 
mainly based on outcome data obtained with statins. The results of the recent IMPROVE-IT trial (with 
ezetimibe, a lipid lowering agent different from statins) strengthen the value of LDL-C as a surrogate 
marker. Still the value of the LDL-C in terms of CV outcomes will need further confirmation with 
evolocumab and other novel therapies. The limited data that are currently available, are reassuring, but 
do not exclude long-term harm in this respect. The cardiovascular outcome trial (FOURIER study) is 
already ongoing and the final results are expected in 2017. Given new mechanism of action of 
evolocumab and the lack of long-term experience the use of evolocumab was restricted to second line 
therapy in patients not sufficiently controlled by a maximum tolerated dose of a statin or who are 
intolerant to statins. The indication included both groups of patients: with hypercholesterolemia and with 
mixed hyperlipidemia (including patients with diabetes mellitus), as both may be at increased 
cardiovascular risk and in need for further lowering of (LDL-)cholesterol as also specified by the current 
clinical practice guidelines. For homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients a CV outcome study 
was considered not feasible due to the limited number of patients available, but reassurance on the 
surrogate effect could be extrapolated from the clinical event data of the aforementioned FOURIER study. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Repatha in the following indication is favourable: 
Hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
Repatha is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach 
LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
• 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or 
for whom a statin is contra-indicated. 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
Repatha is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies.  
The effect of Repatha on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. And 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Zinplava. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication to include treatment of paediatric patients from 
1 to 18 years of age.  
For information, the full indication for Zinplava will therefore be as follows:2

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of

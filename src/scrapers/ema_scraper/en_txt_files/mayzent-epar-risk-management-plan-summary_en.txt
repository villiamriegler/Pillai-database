Summary of the risk management plan for Mayzent™ (Siponimod)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Mayzent. The  RMP  details 
important risks of Mayzent, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Mayzent’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Mayzent’s SmPC/summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Mayzent should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for Mayzent should be read in the context of all this information 
including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Mayzent’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis  (SPMS)  with  active  disease  evidenced  by  relapses  or  imaging  features  of 
inflammatory  activity.  It  contains  siponimod  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  as 
0.25 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg film-coated tablets.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Mayzent’s benefits  can  be  found  in 
Mayzent’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage.
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/mayzent .
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimize  or further 
characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  Mayzent, together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Mayzent’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use including 
treatment  adherence,  in  the  Package  Leaflet and  SmPC  addressed  to  patients  and 
healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.



Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of Mayzent, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Mayzent is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Mayzent are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Mayzent. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Given  the  biologic  plausibility  and  the  well-characterized  risk 
of infections with the other S1P modulator, infections are not 
unexpected.
In  the  controlled  pool,  reactivation  of  VZV  infection  was 
reported for a higher percentage of Mayzent 2 mg patients vs.
placebo,  but  incidences  were  low  (2.9%  of  Mayzent  2 mg 
patients and 0.7% of placebo patients). The exposure adjusted 
rate  of  VZV  reactivation  did  not  increase  with  long-term 
exposure  (IR:  1.7,  95%  CI: 1.4,  2.2,  for  Long-term  pool 
(broad) vs IR: 1.9, 95% CI 1.3, 2.7 for the Controlled pool).
In the Phase III study, decrease in lymphocyte count observed 
in  patients  in  the  Mayzent  2 mg  group  is  seen  early  after 
commencing  treatment  and  is  maintained  as  long  as  the 
patient continues Mayzent therapy.

the reported cases in the Long-term pool were consistent with 
the observations in the Controlled pool.
Patients  with  a  history  of  diabetes  mellitus,  uveitis  and 
underlying/co-existing  retinal  disorders  are  considered  at

An exploratory PK/pharmacogenetic (PG) analysis in the first-
in-human  study  indicated  that  heterozygous  CYP2C9*3 
carriers  tend  to  have  a  higher  AUC  of  Mayzent  compared  to 
subjects  not  carrying  the  *3  allele.  Consequently,  the  PK  of 
Mayzent  was  assessed  in  CYP2C9  extensive  and  poor 
metabolizers  (CYP2C9*1*1  genotype  and  CYP2C9*2*3  or 
*3*3 genotypes, respectively) in [Study A2128]. In addition, 
two PopPK analyses on Phase I/II and Phase III data identified 
CYP2C9  as  a  significant  predictor  of  Mayzent  systemic 
clearance.
In  clinical  DDI  studies,  a  2-fold  higher  and  a  2-fold  lower 
Mayzent  exposure  was  observed  when  co-administered  with 
fluconazole  (a  moderate  CYP2C9/CYP3A4  inhibitor)  and  with 
rifampin  (a  moderate  CYP2C9/strong  CYP3A4 
inducer), 
respectively.  Complementary  PBPK  modeling  indicated  that 
with  decreased  CYP2C9  metabolic  activity  in  the  respective 
genotypes,  a  stronger  effect  of  the  CYP3A4  perpetrators  on 
Mayzent exposure is anticipated, especially for inhibitors.
Under the proposed genotype-based dosing recommendations, 
Mayzent  exposure  is  predicted  to  increase  by  1.05-1.71-fold 
across genotypes in presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
itraconazole, ketoconazole), moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
erythromycin),  or  weak  CYP3A4/2C9
(e.g. 
fluvoxamine) when  compared  to  CYP2C9*1*1  subjects 
receiving  a  2  mg  qd  maintenance  dose  without  co-
administration  of  any  CYP2C9/CYP3A4  perpetrator  drug. In 
presence  of  moderate  CYP2C9 /CYP3A4 inhibitors  (e.g. 
fluconazole), Mayzent exposure is expected to  be 1.78-2.15-
fold  higher  in  all  genotypes  except  CYP2C9*2*2.  A  larger 
increase of 2.73-fold is predicted for the CYP2C9*2*2 patients.
Strong  CYP3A4/moderate  CYP2C9  inducers  (e.g.,  rifampin, 
carbamazepine) are predicted to reduce Mayzent exposure by 
approximately 61% to 76%. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
modafinil)  are  predicted  to  reduce  Mayzent  exposure  by 
approximately 19% to 51%.

Patients with CYP2C9*3*3 genotype
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Section 4.2 included following recommendations:
 Before initiation of treatment, patients must be genotyped 
for CYP2C9 to determine their metaboliser status.
 Mayzent should not be used in patients with a CYP2C9*3*3 
genotype
 A  maintenance  dose  of  1  mg  daily  is  recommended  in 
patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes.
SmPC section 4.3 includes following contraindications:
Patients  homozygous  for  CYP2C9*3  (CYP2C9*3*3)  genotype 
(poor metabolizer).
SmPC Section 4.4 included following recommendations:
 Before initiation of treatment with Mayzent, patients should 
be  genotyped  for  CYP2C9  to  determine  their  metaboliser 
status.
 Patients  homozygous  for  CYP2C9*3  should  not  be  treated 
in 
these  population  results 
with  Mayzent,  use 
substantially elevated Mayzent plasma levels.
in 
 A  maintenance  dose  of  1  mg  daily  is  recommended  in 
patients  with  a  CYP2C9*2*3  or  *1*3  genotypes  to  avoid 
increased exposure to Mayzent.
SmPC Section 4.5 included following recommendations:
 Because of a significant increase in exposure to Mayzent, 
concomitant  use  of  Mayzent  and  medicinal  products  that 
cause  moderate  CYP2C9  and  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A4 
inhibition  is  not  recommended.  This  concomitant  drug 
regimen  can  consist  of  a  moderate  CYP2C9/CYP3A4  dual 
inhibitor (e.g. fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor 
in combination with a separate moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor.
 Due  to  an  expected  reduction  in  Mayzent  exposure, 
appropriateness  and  possible  benefit  of  the  treatment 
should be considered when Mayzent is combined
 with  strong  CYP3A4/moderate  CYP2C9  inducers  (e.g. 
carbamazepine) in all patients regardless of genotype.
 with  moderate  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g.  modafinil)  in 
patients with a CYP2C9*1*3 or *2*3 genotype.

(2.3%)].
Cases  of  herpes  viral  infections,  opportunistic  infections 
(includes cryptococcal infections) and PML were observed while 
on  treatment  with  other  S1P  modulator  (Fingolimod).  In  the 
post-marketing  setting  cases  of  infections  with  opportunistic 
pathogens,  such  as  viral  (e.g.  VZV,  JCV  causing  PML,  HSV),

term safety data as well as additional information on efficacy 
measures.
The  overall  objective  of  the  Mayzent  PRegnancy  Outcome 
Intensive Monitoring program is to prospectively collect and 
evaluate safety data on pregnancy outcomes and congenital 
malformations  related  to  Mayzent  exposure  immediately 
before (up to 10 days  before last menstrual period [LMP]) 
and during pregnancy
The  objective  of 
this  survey,  amongst  HCPs  and 
patients/caregivers  in  selected  European  countries,  is  to 
evaluate whether HCPs and patients/caregivers receive the 
educational  materials  and  to  capture  their  knowledge  and 
behavior around specific Mayzent safety measures

Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 25 July 1997. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  3  October 
1997.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 
1 October 1997. 
During the November 1997 meeting, the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions to 
be sent to the company. The final consolidated list of questions was sent to the Company on 18 
November 1997. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 8 December 1997. 
The clock restarted on 19 December 1997. 
The  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  the  joint  assessment  report  on  the  company’s 
responses  to  the  list  of  questions  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  23  January  1998.  The  joint 
assessment  report  on  responses  to  the  outstanding  points  on  Part  II  was  circulated  on 
10 March 1998. 
During the February 1998 meeting, the CPMP adopted the Rapporteur’s proposed questions for 
oral explanation to be addressed by the company in March 1998. Company’s written responses 
to these proposed questions were provided in advance of the oral explanation. However, upon 
the CPMP request, the hearing was postponed to April 1998 in order to allow an assessment of 
the data and evaluation of the overall benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product.  
The Rapporteur circulated to all CPMP Members on 18 March 1998 a draft assessment report 
on  the  company’s  responses  to  the  pending  issues  for  oral  explanation,  and  additional 
assessment was given on 16 April 1998. 
The CPMP adopted the revised list of pending issues for the oral explanation on 20 April 1998. 
A hearing was held on 21 April 1998, at the CPMP meeting to address the remaining questions 
regarding  data  on  mortality,  endometrial  thickness/carcinoma,  breast  cancer  incidence, 
cardiovascular  effects,  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  and  risk  to  benefit  balance  of 
raloxifene in comparison to estrogen/HRT.

January 2023 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2014 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB 
linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data 
showing haemoglobin increase in non-transfusion dependent patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the severe anaemia, the need 
for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these, in particular in beta- thalassaemia 
major patients; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 people in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain 
of human Activin Receptor IIB linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain may be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data showing that 
treatment of patients with the product may improve anaemia, which is a different aspect to the target 
of the iron chelation products authorised. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000072540 
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified 
form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain, as 
an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and 
major. 
2.2.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
The COMP opinion on the initial review of the orphan medicinal product designation in 2020 was based 
on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1 in 
10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the severe anaemia, the need 
for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Reblozyl may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data that support a 
reduction in transfusion burden, in a population that is broader than the one covered by the 
currently authorised products. The COMP considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Reblozyl, recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked 
to the human IgG1 Fc domain, luspatercept, for treatment of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major 
(EU/3/14/1300) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Beta thalassaemias are a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders caused by genetic 
mutations that reduce or eliminate the expression of β-globin, which results in an α to non-α globin 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000072540 
Page 5/11 
 
 
 
 
 
chain imbalance and decrease in adult haemoglobin (HbA) tetramers in red blood cells (RBCs). 
Unpaired α-globin chains precipitate, leading to destruction of erythroid precursors and ineffective 
erythropoiesis (i.e., destruction of RBC precursors in the bone marrow) and peripheral haemolysis. 
β-thalassaemia is caused by point mutations or, more rarely, deletions in the HBB gene, leading to 
reduced (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the β-chains of haemoglobin. 
Historically, individuals with beta thalassemia were classified as having beta thalassemia major, 
intermedia, and minor (decreasing severity). 
The most severe form is thalassaemia major, which is characterised by a severe (Hb 3 to 4 g/dl) 
transfusion dependent microcytic anaemia with genotype β0/ β0 or β0 / β+ and corresponding 
haemoglobin constitution of HbA2 ≥5%, HbF up to 95% and no HbA. Beta thalassaemia intermedia 
gives a clinical manifestation of moderate microcytic anaemia, has a genotype of β+/ β+ and on typical 
values on haemoglobin analysis HbA2 ≥4%, HbF up to 50%. A moderate, mild microcytic anaemia is 
the characteristic feature of minor beta thalassaemia (also called trait) where the genotype is β/β0 or 
β/β+ haemoglobin analysis and HbF is up to 5%. Subsequently, β-thalassemia has been classified 
Transfusion dependent (TD) β-thalassemia and Non-Transfusion Dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia 
(Taher, 2017). 
The COMP has previously considered that individuals with beta thalassaemia trait are not to be 
included in the proposed orphan condition, because of their limited clinical relevance (Premawardhena 
A Br J Haematol. 2008;141(3):407). 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
anaemia associated with non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “Treatment of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has previously considered that the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating 
due to the severe anaemia, the need for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these. 
This view is still retained.  
All of the pathophysiologic features of β-thalassaemias can be linked to the primary imbalance and 
accumulation of unpaired α-globin chains within the developing erythrocytes, resulting in ineffective 
erythropoiesis and peripheral haemolysis that led to clinical complications including chronic anaemia, 
primary iron overload, and hypercoagulable state (Musallam, 2013a; Taher, 2018a; Sleiman, 2018). 
In the absence of transfusion therapy for the treatment of anaemia, the ineffective erythropoiesis in 
patients with β thalassaemia leads to i) chronic anaemia, which can worsen as patients age, and is 
directly and independently associated with morbidity (Taher, 2010a; Taher, 2010b; Taher, 2015; 
Taher, 2018), ii) iron overload due to erythroid factors produced by erythroid cells, especially under 
conditions of ineffective erythropoiesis and anaemia/hypoxia, that suppress hepcidin synthesis in the 
liver, leading to increased intestinal iron absorption and increased release of recycled iron from the 
reticuloendothelial system (Camaschella, 2016; Rivella, 2015) and iii) other morbidities, such as bone 
marrow expansion and bone changes or mineral density reduction, hypercoagulability due to 
haemolyzed prothrombotic red cell production and vascular disease, as well as gallstone formation due 
to peripheral haemolysis (Musallam, 2013d; Taher, 2017; Taher, 2018). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Non-transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia (NTDT) does not depend on regular transfusion therapy for 
survival. They sporadically need transfusion therapy, e.g., with significant infection, during surgery or 
pregnancy or for limited periods of time with growth retardation in children or when the chronic 
anaemia causes clinical morbidity such as splenomegaly, EMH pseudo tumours, leg ulcers. 
Complications commonly seen in NTDT have been associated with iron overload, such as multisystemic 
iron deposition to the liver, heart, and endocrine system. 
Number of people affected or at risk  
The sponsor proposed a prevalence of approximately 1 in 10,000 persons.  
A number of difference sources were used, as comprehensive prevalence data are not available for 
every EU country. These sources include (i) national databases of rare diseases (from those EU 
countries in which such registries are maintained), (ii) registries from patient advocacy organizations, 
and (iii) primary epidemiological data from peer-reviewed medical literature. Additionally, a 
conservative calculation of prevalence is presented based upon the number of annual conceptions 
carrying combinations of significant haemoglobin gene variants associated with the orphan condition 
(Model, 2007; Model, 2008). 
The calculated prevalence of β-thalassaemia for each EU27 Member State, based on known frequencies 
of haemoglobin gene variants and affected conceptions is presented in Table 1 below. For countries in 
which gene frequency data are not available, the median prevalence value of 0.4 per 10,000 was used 
to estimate disease prevalence across the EU27 Member States.

considered acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Based on the Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) guidelines for the Management of NTDT 
(Thalassaemia International Federation TIF, 2017), current treatment options for NTDT include 
pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions: 
a)  Pharmaceuticals: iron chelation therapy (ICT), prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, and the (at the 
moment off-label) use of hydroxyurea as enhancer of foetal haemoglobin (HbF). A gene therapy - 
autologous CD34+ cells encoding βA-T87Q-globin gene (Zynteglo) – had been authorised in the 
EU, but then withdrawn by the sponsor for marketing reasons.

b)  Non-Pharmaceutical: RBC transfusions, splenectomy.  
The sponsor presented in the Table 2 below the products authorised in the EU for the treatment of β 
thalassaemia intermedia and major. The COMP discussed the authorised products that would be 
considered satisfactory for this new target patient population and if applicable form the basis for the 
justification of significant benefit.

Treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood 
transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate in the following 
patient groups: 
1) in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia 
major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood 
cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
2) in adult and paediatric patients with beta 
thalassaemia major with iron overload due to 
infrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of 
packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
Treatment of chronic iron overload requiring 
chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-
transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes 
aged 10 years and older. 
The proposed new indication for Reblozyl is: ‘‘treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with 
non-transfusion dependent beta thalassemia’.  
The iron chelating agents presented in the table above are used for managing iron overload. Their 
indication is specifically for the treatment of iron overload while the indication for Reblozyl is for the 
treatment of patients with anaemia. There is a recognised overlap in the NTD patients to be treated, 
i.e. patients having both anaemia and iron overload. However, due to fact that Reblozyl is targeting a 
different aspect of the condition than deferoxamine/deferoxamine mesilate (Desferal), deferiprone 
(Ferriprox) and deferasirox (Exjade), the latter three products are not considered as satisfactory 
methods, especially in treating anaemia.

4.  COMP position adopted on 31 January 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 1 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the severe anaemia, the need 
for blood transfusions, and the complications related to these, in particular in beta- thalassaemia 
major patients; 
at present, no satisfactory methods have been authorised in the EU for patients covered by the 
currently approved therapeutic indication, i.e. treatment of adult patients with non-transfusion 
dependent beta thalassemia associated with anaemia. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Reblozyl, recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of human activin receptor IIB linked 
to the human IgG1 Fc domain, luspatercept for treatment of beta-thalassaemia intermedia and major 
(EU/3/14/1300) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

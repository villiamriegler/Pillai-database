Clinical study R668-EE-1774 
Study Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, 3-Part Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab 
in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) 
Description 
Study R668-EE-1774 was a Phase 3, Randomized, 3-Part Study (Part A, B and C) to investigate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Adults and Adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). 
Part A and Part B each consisting of a 24-week double-blind treatment period. Part C was a 28-week 
extended active treatment period. 
Study 1 Flow Diagram (Parts A, B, and C) 
Study R668-EE-1774 was conducted from 24 Sep 2018 (date of first consent to first screened 
participant in Part A) to 07 Jun 2022 (date of last visit in 12-week follow-up period for participants in 
Part B/C). 
The Part A, A/C and B CSRs of R668-EE-1774 were submitted on 1 April 2022 in EoE Type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0062 eCTD sequence 0160). The part B/C results made available subsequently 
were included in response to request for supplementary information submitted on 7 September (eCTD 
sequence 0173). 
Part A/C (Addendum 2) 
The results from the 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C) of Study R668-EE-1774 for 
participants who entered Part A were reported in the Part A/C clinical study report (CSR) (data cut-off

and database lock dated 18 Nov 2020 and 17 Dec 2020, respectively). At the time of the data cut-off 
for the Part A/C CSR, 66 participants had completed week 52 with 22 of these participants continuing 
in the follow-up period. Additionally, 6 participants were still in the extended active treatment period 
for Part A/C at the time of the data cut-off of 18 Nov 2020. Therefore, a total of 28 participants were 
ongoing at the 18 Nov 2020 data cut-off point.  
Among the 66 participants, 50 participants had follow-up period data that were reported in the Part 
A/C CSR. Individual patient data profiles containing data for the 6 participants collected from 18 Nov 
2020 (data cut-off for Part A/C CSR) to 27 May 2021 (last participant last visit [LPLV]) were included in 
the first addendum to the R668-EE-1774 Part A/C CSR. The first addendum also included additional 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and antidrug antibody (ADA) data that were not available at the time of the data 
cut-off and additional database errata from Part A/C arising since the data cut-off for the Part A/C CSR. 
Study R668-EE-1774 is now complete and the final database lock has occurred. Addendum 2 to the 
R668-EE-1774 Part A/C CSR includes the following information: 
•  A summary which includes the complete data for all 65 participants who completed the Part 
A/C 12-week follow-up period. This includes the post-treatment follow-up period data which 
was included in the Part A/C CSR and new data from the participants who were ongoing at the 
time of the data cut-off for the Part A/C CSR. Refer to Section 3. 
•  A summary of additional data collected following the initial week 52 database lock for the Part 
A/C CSR (on 17 Dec 2020). Several data points previously summarized in the Part A/C CSR 
have been updated based on additional data collected by the final database lock (on 14 Jul 
2022). 
Methods 
Study 2 Design of Part A/C 
In Part A, participants were randomized to receive either placebo or dupilumab 300 mg SC once QW 
for 24 weeks. All participants who completed Part A and entered the extended active treatment period 
received dupilumab 300 mg QW for 28 weeks in Part A/C regardless of treatment in Part A (ie, 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW). The participants 
who entered Part C after completing Part A then continued in the 12-week follow-up period. No study 
treatment was administered during the 12-week follow-up period. 
Study participants 
The study population of Part A/C consisted of adult males and females ≥18 years of age and adolescent 
males and females ≥12 to <18 years of age with EoE at the time of study entry into Part A. Participants 
who developed a serious or drug related adverse event during Parts A or B, which in the opinion of the 
investigator could indicate that continued treatment may have presented an unreasonable risk for the

participant, poor compliance or inability to complete required study assessments, became pregnant, 
prematurely discontinued from study, did not undergo endoscopy with biopsies prior to receiving 
rescue treatment or systemic hypersensitivity to dupilumab or the excipients were excluded. 
Treatments 
All participants who continued into Part A/C of the study were treated with SC dupilumab 300 mg QW, 
regardless of randomized treatment received in Part A. All participants received at least 1 dose of 
dupilumab 300 mg QW during Part A/C and are included in the Part C SAF. 
Objectives 
The objective of the 12-week safety follow-up period was to assess the safety of dupilumab treatment 
in adult and adolescent participants with EoE after the 52 weeks of treatment. 
There were no efficacy objectives or endpoints defined for the 12-week follow-up period. However, the 
DSQ continued to be collected during the 12-week follow up period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The Main Endpoints from Part C were: 
• 
Proportion of participants achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 
eos/hpf at week 52 
•  Absolute change in DSQ score from baseline to week 52 
•  Absolute change in EoE-EREFS from baseline to week 52 
• 
Percent change in peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count (eos/hpf) from baseline to 
week 52 
•  Absolute change in EoE Grade Score from the EoEHSS from baseline to week 52 
•  Absolute change in EoE Stage Score from the EoEHSS from baseline to week 52 
• 
Proportion of participants achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of <15 
eos/hpf at week 52 
Proportion of participants achieving peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤1 
eos/hpf at week 52 
Percent change in DSQ from baseline to week 52

• 
Sample size 
Of the 77 participants who entered Part C from Part A, 65 participants (84.4%) completed the study 
(ie, completed Part A, Part A/C, and 12-week follow-up period) and 12 participants (15.6%) 
prematurely discontinued from the study. Eleven participants discontinued prior to the follow-up period 
and 1 participant prematurely discontinued during the follow-up period. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Part A: randomised 1:1 to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=42) or placebo (N=39), 
stratified by age (≥18 vs. ≥12 to <18 years of age) and use of PPI at randomization (yes vs. no). 
Part C: all patients who previously participated in Part A received 300 mg dupilumab (N=77) every 
week.

Chart 1 Participant Disposition for Participants in the Part A/C Follow-up Period 
Seventy-seven participants from Part A entered Part C of the study. Overall, 65 participants (84.4%) 
completed the study (Part A, Part A/C, and 12-week follow-up period) and 12 participants (15.6%) 
prematurely discontinued from the study. Eleven participants discontinued prior to the follow-up period 
and 1 participant prematurely discontinued during the follow-up period. The reasons for premature 
discontinuation from the study included lost to follow-up (7.8%), withdrawal by participant (5.2%), AE 
(1.3% with an AE of arthralgia) and other reasons (1.3%). The other reason for discontinuation was 
that the participant was not comfortable coming on-site for the week 52 esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
(EGD) procedure/clinic visit due to the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Recruitment 
24 Sep 2018 (date of first consent to first screened participant in Part A of the study) to 27 May 2021 
(date of last participant last visit in the 12-week follow-up period for participants in Part A/C of the 
study). 
The analyses presented in Addendum 2 are based on an end of study (final) database lock date of 14 
Jul 2022.

Baseline data 
At baseline of Part A/C, demographic characteristics were consistent with that for participants from the 
Part A FAS. The majority of participants were male (61.0%) and most participants were white (96.1%) 
and not Hispanic or Latino (93.5%).  The mean age of participants at study entry was 31.8 years with 
24.1% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 41.6% of participants ≥18 to <40 years of age, and 
33.8% of participants ≥40 to <65 years of age.  No participants in Part C were ≥65 years of age. Most 
participants were from the United States (96.1%), with 3.9% from Spain. Demographic characteristics 
for participants from Part A who enrolled in Part C were consistent with that for participants from the 
Part A FAS. 
At the start of Part C, the mean peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 3 oesophageal 
regions was 66.7 eos/hpf in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 12.3 eos/hpf in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/ dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
A total of 98.7% in the Part C (Participants from Part A) used at least 1 medication prior to Part C of 
the study (other than PPIs for EoE). The most frequently reported ATC Therapeutic Classes of prior 
medications were Anesthetics (80.5%), Antihistamines for Systemic Use (57.1%), Drugs for 
Obstructive Airway Disease (57.1%), Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Anti-inflammatory / Anti-infective 
Agents (55.8%), and Blood Substitutes and Perfusion Solutions (44.2%). The most frequently reported 
procedure aside from endoscopies and esophagogastroduodenoscopies, was the oesophageal dilation 
procedure (42.9%), which was done for treatment of EoE. 
Adolescents 
In Part A, a total of 20 participants were adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age). 11 adolescents were 
randomized to the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 9 to the placebo group. The mean age of the adolescent 
subgroup was 14.9 years. The majority were male (80.0%) and most participants were white (90.0%). 
The mean weight and BMI of adolescent participants was 58.9 kg and 20.8 kg/m2, respectively with 
35.0% ≥60 kg. Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment 
groups. The majority had previously used STCs for EoE (85.0%) and 10.0% had prior oesophageal 
dilations with a mean of 2.5 previous dilations. 
Number analysed 
37 subjects (22 dupilumab, 15 placebo subjects) included in absolute change from DSQ score (Part A) 
until week 64 (week 12 of follow-up). 37 subjects (22 dupilumab, 15 placebo subjects) included in 
absolute change from DSQ score (Part C) until week 64 (week 12 of follow-up).

Table 1 Summary of Study Analysis Set (All Randomized Participants in Part A Who Entered Part C) 
Efficacy results 
There were no efficacy objectives or endpoints defined for the 12-week follow-up period. 
However, the DSQ continued to be collected during the 12-week follow up period. DSQ results for Part 
C are presented for all observed values regardless of rescue treatment use. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire Total Score 
Absolute Change from Part A Baseline 
The DSQ total score was calculated based on the daily responses over a 14-day period. A minimum of 
8 diary entries was required for each 14-day period to derive a standardized DSQ total score. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the mean absolute change from the Part 
A baseline was −21.95 at the Part A/C baseline (N=35) and −24.27 points (15.261) at week 52 
(N=30). These findings show that dysphagia symptoms continued to improve with an additional 28 
weeks of treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW. 
A similar improvement can be seen for the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the mean absolute 
change in DSQ total score from the Part A baseline was −9.43 points at the Part A/C baseline (N=31) 
and −21.53 points at week 52 (N=24). 
Absolute Change from Part A Baseline 
The mean DSQ total score at week 64 (end of the 12-week follow-up period) increased when compared 
to the mean score at week 52, suggesting a worsening in dysphagia once treatment is stopped. 
The mean DSQ total score at week 52 and at week 64 by treatment group were dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group: 7.73 at week 52 (N=30) and 9.72 at week 64 (N=22); 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group: 11.81 at week 52 (N=24) and 13.74 at week 64 (N=15).

Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use (Part A/C Follow-up Period SAF) 
Absolute Change from Part A/C Baseline (ie, week 24) 
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the mean absolute change in DSQ total 
score from the Part A/C baseline was −2.35 points at week 52 (N=30). In the placebo/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group, the mean absolute change in DSQ total score from the Part A/C baseline was −10.79 at 
week 52 (N=24). These findings show improvement in DSQ total score with dupilumab 300 mg QW 
during the extended active treatment period. 
Adolescents 
In Part A/C, 3 of 9 (33.3%) adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group and 6/8 (75.0%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak oesophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 52. Two adolescent participants in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count 
≤6 eos/hpf at baseline of Part C but were no longer responders at week 52. 
Adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained 
improvement in DSQ total score with continued treatment during Part C. The mean change from the 
Part A baseline (36.21) was -24.80 points at the Part C baseline (week 24; N=10) and −25.57 points 
at week 52 (N=6). Adolescent participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started 
dupilumab treatment in Part C showed progressive improvement. The mean change from the Part A 
baseline (36.04) was -25.45 points at week 52 (N=5).

Safety results 
Table 2 Overall Summary of Number of Participants with TEAEs During Follow-up Period (Part A/C 
Follow-up Period SAF) 
Overall, 12 participants (18.2%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the follow up 
period (Table 2). One participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group reported 
2 TEAEs (Preferred Term [PT]: Nausea and Constipation) mild in severity and assessed by the 
investigator as related to the study drug. The remainder of the TEAEs were assessed by the 
investigators as not related to the study drug. 
Overall, the system organ classes (SOCs) with >5% incidence were Gastrointestinal disorders and 
Infections and infestations. Within these SOCs, all TEAEs were reported in 1 participant (1.5%) each 
and were either mild or moderate in severity. No severe TEAEs were reported for any participant 
during the Part A/C follow-up period. 
No treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the Part A/C follow up 
period at the time of the first database lock. After the final database lock (14 Jul 2022), 1 SAE of 
Pneumonia mycoplasmal was reported in 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group. The adverse event (AE) started as a non-serious AE 70 days after the 52nd and last 
dose of the study drug and became an SAE (because it required hospitalization) 73 days after the last 
dose of study drug. The SAE was moderate in intensity and assessed as not related to study drug by 
the study investigator. The outcome of the SAE was reported as recovering/resolving. The SAE was 
reported by the site after the participant’s participation in the study had ended. The participant did not 
complete the study per protocol due to being lost to follow-up after completing week 52. 
No deaths were reported during the Part A/C follow-up period. 
CHMP comment 
The submitted Addendum 2 summarizes the complete data for the Part A/C 12-week follow-up period 
and updates to data reported in Part A/C CSR versus data collected through final database lock (14 Jul 
2022). No new safety findings were identified during the follow-up period or from updates in the data. 
The changes to the Part A/C data are considered not clinically relevant and are generally consistent 
with the previous results and conclusions reported. These updates have no impact on the conclusions 
regarding the efficacy and safety of the dupilumab 300 mg QW for the treatment of adult and 
adolescent participants with EoE.

PART B/C 
Part B/C of the study assessed the maintenance of efficacy over the 52-week treatment period for 
participants who received dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W during both Part B and Part B/C and 
the treatment effect for participants who received 24 weeks of placebo during Part B and switched to 
28 weeks of treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW or Q2W during Part B/C. All endpoints in Part B/C 
were considered secondary.  
The secondary endpoints were assessed at week 52, 1 week after the last dose of study drug during 
the extended active treatment period. 
Methods 
After completing the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week treatment period (Part B), 
eligible participants could enter a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C). Participants who 
were randomized to placebo during Part B were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 
mg once weekly (QW) or dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W; with matching placebo alternating 
with dupilumab doses) in Part B/C, and those who were randomized to dupilumab in Part B remained 
on the same dupilumab dose regimen (300 mg QW or Q2W) in Part B/C. 
Figure 2 Study Design - Part B, Part B/C, and Follow-up Period 
Efficacy assessments were performed at specified time points and included an oesophageal endoscopy 
with biopsies for histologic assessments including intraepithelial eosinophil count and EoE Histology 
Scoring System (EoEHSS, EoE-EREFS) performed by the investigator during the endoscopy to assess 
oesophageal mucosal inflammatory and remodelling features. Patient-reported outcomes including 
Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) were completed daily to assess the frequency and severity 
of dysphagia, EoE Impact Questionnaire (EoE-IQ) to assess disease-specific health-related quality of 
life and EoE Symptom Questionnaire (EoE-SQ) to assess the frequency and severity of symptoms other 
than dysphagia and swallowing pain.

The impact of dupilumab on disease markers, including markers associated with the EoE disease 
process or markers of type 2 inflammation was assessed. In addition, circulating biomarkers of type 2 
inflammation, which are believed to be relevant to the pathophysiology of EoE were assessed. 
Change(s) in Study Conduct 
Five protocol amendments were published during the study. All changes in the conduct of the study 
were implemented by protocol amendments. 
Of note, the purpose of protocol amendment 4, finalized on 16 Apr 2020) was to protect participant 
safety and data integrity during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by allowing for 
certain study procedures to occur at delayed time points and/or outside of the clinic environment. All 
temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures in response to COVID-
19 were to be documented as being related to COVID-19 and remain in effect only for the duration of 
the public health emergency. Protocol Amendment 5, finalized on 06 Nov 2020, clarified that any 
additional analysis and methods required to investigate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, 
including extended dosing, on the safety evaluation would be specified in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). 
Study participants 
The study population consisted of adult males and females ≥18 years of age and adolescent males and 
females ≥12 to <18 years of age with EoE at the time of study entry into Part B. 
At the start of Part B, study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of EoE that was 
not responsive to high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Participants who were receiving PPIs 
during the screening period and eligible to enrol in the study were to continue a stable high-dose PPI 
regimen during the study. All participants were required to have an oesophageal endoscopy with 
biopsies at the baseline visit, which demonstrated ≥15 intraepithelial eos/hpf in at least 2 of 3 
oesophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal). Study participants were also required to have a 
history of an average of at least 2 episodes of dysphagia per week in the 4 weeks prior to screening, 
and at least 4 episodes of dysphagia in the 2 weeks prior to baseline. Participants must also have 
completed at least 11 of 14 days of the DSQ eDiary data entry in the 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit 
and have a baseline DSQ score ≥10. 
Participants who completed Part B of the study could have either entered Part B/C (28-week extended 
active treatment period) or continued into a 12-week follow-up period. Excluded from Part B/C were 
participants who developed a serious adverse event (SAE) and/or AE related to the study drug during 
Part B, prematurely withdrawn during Part B due to a protocol violation, became pregnant during Part 
B, prematurely discontinued from study drug due to an AE, did not undergo endoscopy with biopsies 
prior to receiving rescue treatment or systemic hypersensitivity to dupilumab or the excipients. 
Treatments 
All participants entering Part B/C from Part B received dupilumab 300 mg, regardless of randomized 
treatment received during Part B. Participants who were randomized to placebo during Part B were re-
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W with matching 
placebo alternating with dupilumab doses so the injection frequency was identical for both groups for 
regimen-blinding purposes in Part B/C, and those who were randomized to one of the dupilumab dose 
regimens in Part B remained on the same dupilumab dose regimen in Part B/C. No treatment was 
administered during the 12-week follow-up period.

Part B/C study drug treatment was extended for 15 participants beyond the planned 28-week 
treatment period (>28 injections). Protocol Amendment 4 allowed participants to continue Part B/C 
study drug treatment beyond the planned 28-week treatment period if the week 52 endoscopy with 
biopsies was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Exposure: 
Overall, the mean treatment compliance during Part B/C was high (98.86%) with a mean number of 
study drug administrations (injections) during Part B/C of 26.6 and mean treatment duration of 190.6 
days. Mean dupilumab treatment duration inclusive of during both Part B and Part B/C of the study was 
310.0 days. 
Objectives and endpoints 
Sample size 
Of the 240 participants who were randomized into Part B of the study, 227 participants (74 placebo, 74 
dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 79 dupilumab 300 mg Q2W) entered Part B/C from multiple global sites.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Part B: randomised 1:1:1 to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=80), 300 mg dupilumab 
every other week (N=81; the 300 mg every other week dosage regimen is not approved for EoE) or 
placebo (N=79) stratified by age (≥18 vs ≥12 to <18 years of age) and use of PPI at randomization 
(yes vs. no). 
Of the patients who previously participated in Part B, those who received dupilumab in Part B 
continued their dosing regimen in Part C and those who received placebo were randomised to either 
dosing regimen. 
Participants who received 300 mg Q2W in Part B also continued with matching placebo alternating with 
dupilumab doses so the injection frequency was identical for both groups for regimen-blinding 
purposes. 
Statistical Methods 
The co-primary and secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 during Part B were assessed at week 52 
as secondary endpoints for the extended treatment period (Part B/C) and summarized with descriptive 
statistics based on the treatment assignment in the double-blind treatment period, as well as the 
extended active treatment assignment for participants previously in the placebo group (i.e., 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW, placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 
300 mg QW, and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W). 
For continuous endpoints, in addition to summary of change from the Part B baseline, summary of 
change from the Part B/C baseline was provided to assess the maintenance of effect with continued 
treatment of dupilumab from the end of Part B (Week 24) through the end of Part B/C (Week 52) in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W groups.

Chart 2 Participant Disposition for Participants in the Part B/C Follow-up Period 
Continuation into Part B/C 
Of the 240 participants who were randomized into Part B of the study, 227 participants (74 placebo, 74 
dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 79 dupilumab 300 mg Q2W) entered Part B/C and were included in the 
current analysis. The remaining 13 participants (5 placebo, 6 dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 2 dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W) did not participate in Part B/C.  
Reasons for not participating in Part B/C were: 
•  Developed an AE deemed related to study drug and/or SAE in Part B (1 dupilumab 300 mg QW 
[Breast cancer] and 1 dupilumab 300 mg Q2W [Rhabdomyolysis] participants) 
•  Withdrew from Part B due to a protocol violation, poor compliance, or inability to complete 
required study assessments (1 dupilumab 300 mg QW participant) 
• 
Prematurely discontinued from study drug due to an AE during Part B (2 placebo [Hepatic 
enzyme increased and Oral herpes], 1 dupilumab 300 mg QW [Hypermobility syndrome and 
Myalgia], and 1 dupilumab 300 mg Q2W [Congenital coronary artery malformation and 
Dyspnoea] participants); 
•  Other reasons including: 
-  COVID-19 restrictions causing continued delay in visit 11 and psychosocial acopia (1 
placebo participant) 
-  Withdrawn consent due to AE (PT of Oral herpes [verbatim term: worsening cold sore] 
considered related to study drug; 1 placebo participant) 
-  Did not complete visit 11/week 24 (1 placebo participant decided to stop due to COVID-19 
pandemic) 
-  Did not receive study drug (1 placebo participant) 
-  Withdrawn consent (2 dupilumab 300 mg QW participants).

Part B/C Study Treatment Completion Status 
All 227 participants from Part B who continued into Part B/C were treated with at least 1 dose of 
dupilumab 300 mg SC during Part B/C (37 placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW, 37 placebo/dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W, 74 dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 79 dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W) and were included in the Part B/C SAF. Most participants (209/227, 
92.1%) completed 52 weeks of study treatment (ie, 24 weeks of study drug in Part B plus 28 weeks of 
study drug in Part B/C). Eighteen of 227 participants (7.9%) discontinued study drug during Part B/C. 
The most frequent reason for discontinuation of study treatment was withdrawal by participant (1 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW, 4 dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 1 dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W participants).  
Two participants discontinued study treatment due to AEs ([PTs: Aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, Alanine aminotransferase increased, and Blood creatine phosphokinase increased] and [PT: 
Joint noise]), both in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. One participant, in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, discontinued study treatment due to the COVID-19 
pandemic (ie, physician decision due to COVID-19). 
Study Completion Status 
Of the 227 participants who entered Part B/C, 200 (88.1%) completed the study (defined as 
completing Part B, Part B/C, and 12-week follow-up period) and 27 (11.9%) discontinued the study, 
including 4 participants who discontinued the study during the 12-week follow-up period. The most 
frequent reasons for discontinuing from the study were lost to follow-up and withdrawal by participant. 
One participant, in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, discontinued the study during the 
follow-up period due to an AE (PT of Joint noise). No participant discontinued from the study due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
Adolescents 
Of the 227 participants who entered Part B/C, 75 were adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age). Of these 
75 adolescent participants, 71 completed 52 weeks of study drug and 4 discontinued study drug during 
Part B/C. Three of these adolescent participants were in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group (withdrawal by participant [1], protocol violation [1], Other [missed visit 18] [1]) and 1 was 
in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (withdrawal by participant [1]) 
discontinued study drug during Part B/C. 
Of the 75 adolescent participants, 67 completed the study, and 9 discontinued the study. Of the 9 
adolescent participants who discontinued the study, 3 participants were in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (withdrawal by participant [n=2], protocol violation [n=1]), 5 
participants were in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (protocol violation 
[n=1], lost to follow-up [n=3], withdrawal by participant [n=1]), and 1 participant was in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (lost to follow-up). 
Recruitment 
Study Period was from 12 Aug 2019 (date of first consent for first screened participant in Part B) to 07 
Jun 2022 (date of last visit in 12-week follow-up period for participants in Part B/C). The analyses 
presented in the report are based on an end of study (final) database lock date of 14 Jul 2022.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants at study entry (Part B) for participants 
included in Part B/C of the study were generally balanced across treatment groups and similar to a 
typical EoE patient population published in the literature with respect to sex, ethnicity, and race. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for participants who enrolled in Part B/C were also consistent 
with those for participants from the Part B. 
Overall, the majority of participants in Part B/C were male (63.9%) and most participants were White 
(90.7%) and not Hispanic or Latino (94.3%). The mean age of these participants at study entry was 
28.1 years with 33.0% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 45.4% of participants ≥18 to <40 years 
of age, and 20.7% of participants ≥40 to <65 years of age. 
Two participants (0.9%) were ≥65 years of age. Most participants were from the US with 81.5%, with 
4.0% from Australia, 3.5% from Canada, 3.1% from Italy, 2.6% from Spain, 1.8% from Netherlands, 
1.3% from Belgium, 0.9% from Germany, 0.9% from UK and 0.4% from France. 
The placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group had a higher percentage of male participants (81.1%) than 
in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW (64.9%), dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(64.9%), or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (54.4%) groups. The placebo/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group had a smaller percentage of participants <60 kg (10.8%) than in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (21.6%), dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW (28.4%), or 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (27.8%) groups. 
Baseline disease characteristics at study entry (i.e., Part B baseline) indicated a highly symptomatic 
population, often refractory to other therapies, with the majority of participants having previously used 
STCs for the treatment of EoE (74.0%) and approximately one-third of participants having prior 
oesophageal dilations (35.2%) with a mean of 2.4 previous dilations. Overall, 28.6% had a history of 
both STC used for the treatment of EoE and prior oesophageal dilation.  
Only 30.8% reported STCs as being effective for EoE. Overall 49.3% had a history of an inadequate 
response, intolerance, and /or contraindication to STCs. Approximately 70% of participants were 
receiving PPIs at the time of randomization. More than one-half of participants (59.9%) had been on a 
food elimination diet in the past.  
The mean peak eosinophil count of 3 oesophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal) at the Part B 
baseline was 86.8 eos/hpf. The mean EREFS total score at Part B baseline was 7.1 points. The mean 
DSQ score at the Part B baseline was 36.6, indicating substantial dysphagia symptom burden. The 
mean number of days with dysphagia at the Part B baseline was 10.7 days out of 14 days, with more 
than two-thirds of participants (70.5%) having dysphagia for ≥10 out of 14 days.  
A number of participants in the SAF had other type 2 co-morbidities, including atopic dermatitis 
(26.4%), asthma (43.6%), and allergic rhinitis (63.4%). 
At the start of Part B/C, the mean peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 3 oesophageal 
regions was higher in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W groups than in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W groups 
consistent with the clinically and statistically significant reduction in peak eosinophil score at the end of 
Part B. At the start of Part B/C, the mean DSQ total scores were higher in the placebo/dupilumab 300 
mg QW, placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
groups than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. These findings demonstrate 
the clinically and statistically significant symptomatic improvement in dysphagia symptoms observed 
after treatment with dupilumab 300 QW at the end of Part B.

Results from Part B/C support the long-term efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg in adult and adolescent 
participants with EoE. 
Efficacy with the dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen observed at the Part B/C baseline continued to 
improve during Part B/C (dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group). While 64.9% of 
participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part B achieved peak oesophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at the Part B/C baseline (Week 24) this increased to 84.6% after 52 
weeks, and remarkably, 100% of participants on this regimen achieved <15 eos/hpf after 52 weeks of 
treatment (89.2% after 24 weeks). Similarly, DSQ total scores continued to improve (mean decrease 
from Part B baseline) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/ dupilumab 300 mg QW group from −25.99 at the 
Part B/C baseline (ie, week 24) to −30.26 at week 52. 
In addition, participants who received placebo in Part B achieved improvements in efficacy after 28 
weeks on dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part B/C (placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group) that were similar 
to improvements observed for participants who received 24 weeks of dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment 
during Part B. 
Except for dysphagia, the predominant symptom of EoE, the magnitude of improvements in other 
histologic, endoscopic, and molecular outcomes after 24 weeks of treatment with dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W were similar to those observed with dupilumab 300 mg QW. After 24 weeks of treatment, the 
dupilumab Q2W dosing regimen showed numerically less improvement in dysphagia symptoms 
compared with the dupilumab 300 mg QW regimen. During Part B/C, continued treatment with 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W showed improvement in dysphagia and maintenance of effect on histologic, 
endoscopic, and molecular measures at week 52. Except for dysphagia, the magnitude of 
improvements with continued treatment with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in Part B/C were consistent with 
those observed with the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen. A reason for 
this difference was discussed during the Extension of indication procedure. The reason for the 
disparate results of the two different dupilumab dosing regimens for the co-primary endpoint of peak 
oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count (≤6/hpf defining a histologic remission) and the DSQ (a 
validated tool to measure the frequency and severity of dysphagia) could not be finally identified, 
although it is known that dupilumab has a broader pharmacologic effect than influencing eosinophil 
infiltration to oesophageal mucosa alone. One hypothesis may be that, in addition to the effect 
compartment for the drug effect on infiltration of eosinophils in the oesophageal mucosa, the drug 
effect on dysphagia may be modulated by a different effect compartment (e.g., muscularis layer, 
oesophageal nervous plexus).   
Treatment effects on dysphagia, histologic, endoscopic, and molecular measures at week 52 in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group showed a similar trend to the treatment effects observed at the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Part B/C baseline for participants who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W during Part B. However, 
participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W who switched from placebo treatment in Part B 
achieved a lower level of improvement in dysphagia compared with placebo participants who were re-
randomized to treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part B/C. 
The DSQ total score was the only efficacy outcome that was collected after week 52 to the end of the 
study (week 64). As observed from the follow-up period, there was worsening of DSQ total score from 
week 52 to week 64 in all treatment groups when dupilumab treatment was stopped, suggesting an 
increase in disease activity. However, it is not clear at what point after treatment discontinuation 
worsening of DSQ total score was seen. The persistence in effect of about 8 weeks post dosing is 
expected based on the PK profile of dupilumab. 
Figure 3 1/1C-bf Mean (+/-SE) of Absolute Change in DSQ Total Score From Part C Baseline to Week 
64, All Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use (Follow-up Period Safety Analysis Set – 
Patients in Part B Who Entered Follow-Up After Part C) 
For other secondary efficacy endpoints of patient-reported outcomes, including measures to assess 
non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE-SQ) and disease-specific health-related QOL (EoE-IQ), numerical 
improvements from the Part B baseline were observed at week 52 in participants treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW and to a lesser extent Q2W during Part B/C. 
Similar effects on efficacy as observed for the overall population were demonstrated for the subgroup 
of adolescent participants and for the subgroups of participants with prior use of STCs and participants 
who were inadequately controlled by, or were intolerant to, or had contraindications to STCs. 
These findings provide clinical evidence of the durability of the histological response, symptomatic 
response, endoscopic response and molecular outcomes in adult and adolescent participants with EoE 
after treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW for up to 52 weeks. These findings also demonstrated the 
robust efficacy with 28 weeks of dupilumab 300 mg QW following 24 weeks of placebo treatment. 
Adolescents 
The dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW treated group demonstrated continued 
improvement in the proportion of adolescent participants who achieved a peak oesophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf in all 3 regions of the esophagus (histologic remission) at 
Week 52. At baseline of Part C (Week 24), 66.7% of adolescent participants treated with dupilumab 
300 mg QW achieved histologic remission. The results from Part B/C show continued improvement with 
81.8% adolescent participants achieving histological remission at Week 52. The dupilumab 300 mg

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/113518/2023

Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group also demonstrated sustained improvement. Overall 53.8% of 
participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W achieved histologic remission at Week 24, with 
60.0% achieving histological remission in all 3 regions at Week 52.  
This observation is consistent with the Part B data, showing that highest rates in histologic response in 
adolescent participants are reached with the 300 mg QW dosing regimen. 
The results from Part B/C also show that adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained improvement in DSQ total score, with lower scores with 
continued treatment during Part C. The mean absolute change from the Part B baseline was -22.26 
points at the Part C baseline (Week 24; N=24) and -26.86 points at Week 52 (N=15).  
The adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group also showed 
improvement at Week 52. However, the magnitude of improvements in DSQ total score achieved were 
lower than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, either at Week 24 or Week 52. The mean absolute 
change from the Part B baseline was -17.00 points at Week 52 (N=16). Based on these results from 
the 300 mg Q2W treatment group, the treatment effect improves but the results are of lesser extent. 
Overall the 300 mg QW dosing regimen showed higher efficacy in achieving histological remission and 
the reduction of dysphagia burden in the adolescent participants. 
Safety results 
Safety was evaluated in participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Table 5 Overall Summary of Number of Participants with TEAEs During Part B/C 28-Week Treatment 
Period (Part B/C SAF) 
The proportion of participants who experienced a TEAE across the treatment groups ranged from 
59.5% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group to 70.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. By PT, the most frequent TEAEs reported overall (in ≥5% of 
participants) were Injection site reaction (13.7%), Injection site pain (8.4%), Injection site erythema 
(6.6%), and COVID-19 (7.9%). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The 
proportions of participants experiencing a treatment-related TEAE was 18.9% in participants receiving 
dupilumab QW in Part B/C (placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW groups) and higher in those receiving dupilumab Q2W in Part B/C (32.4% in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 31.6% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W group).

No deaths were reported during Part B/C.  
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
by PT: Diarrhoea and Rectal tenesmus (2 SAEs in 1 participant), Enterocolitis infectious (1 participant) 
and Chest pain (1 participant) and in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group Vomiting (1 
participant) and Cellulitis (1 participant). None of the SAEs were assessed to be related to study drug 
by the investigator. None of these SAEs lead to permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
There were no TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study drug in any of the 
dupilumab/dupilumab groups or in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. In the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, there were 2 participants with TEAEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of the study drug (Joint noise in 1 participant and Aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, Alanine aminotransferase increased, and Blood creatine phosphokinase increased in another 
participant). The TEAE of Joint noise was assessed by the investigator to be related to study drug, 
while the other TEAEs were assessed as unrelated. There was no pattern among the reported SAEs or 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug identified to suggest any relationship to 
dupilumab treatment. 
TEAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC were closely examined to determine if there was an 
association of TEAEs with dupilumab use. The most frequently reported PT in this SOC was COVID-19 
(7.9% overall) followed by Nasopharyngitis (4.4%) and Urinary tract infection (2.6%). All other PTs in 
this SOC were reported in <2% of participants overall.  
The majority of TEAEs in this SOC were mild (18.5%) or moderate (6.6%) in intensity and all were 
assessed as not related to the study drug. Two participants (0.9% overall) experienced severe events 
in this SOC category (PTs: COVID-19 and Cellulitis). Both events were assessed as not related to study 
drug. The Cellulitis event was considered serious, as well as a PT of Enterocolitis. No TEAEs that led to 
permanent withdrawal of the study drug were reported in this SOC in any group. There was no pattern 
among the reported events in this SOC identified to suggest any relationship to dupilumab treatment. 
A review of COVID-19 cases throughout the dupilumab program clinical database, post-marketing 
data, as well as the published literature did not reveal a systemic imbalance in COVID-19 TEAEs 
During Part B/C of the study, 3.1% of the participants overall had an AESI. One participant each in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (2.7%; PT of Anaphylactic reaction), the placebo/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group (2.7%; PT of Arthralgia), and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group (1.3%; PT of Oral herpes), and 4 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group (5.4%; all PTs of Arthralgia).  
All the AESIs were non-serious and assessed by the investigator to be not related to the study drug. 
The study drug was continued in all cases, except in 1 participant for which it was reported unknown. 
Overall, 24.5% experienced TEAEs during the 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. The majority 
of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. One participant (in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group) had a treatment-related TEAE (mild Rash) during the follow-up period.  
No deaths were reported during the follow-up period. 
One SAE was reported during the follow-up period in 1 participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W group (Open globe injury in 1 participant). After database lock, another 2 SAEs in 1 participant in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group were reported (Generalized anxiety 
disorder and Substance use disorder). The events were severe in intensity, assessed by the 
investigator as not related to study drug and the events resolved before the end of the follow-up 
period.

There was no consistent trend towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time 
from the Part B/C baseline for any haematology or chemistry parameter except eosinophil counts. 
Mean eosinophil counts at Part B/C baseline were higher in participants previously receiving placebo 
than dupilumab, with larger mean changes from the Part B/C baseline at week 52 in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.1697×109/L) and placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
(−0.1800×109/L) groups than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.0332×109/L) 
and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (−0.0014×109/L) groups. 
Otherwise, there were no clinically meaningful changes or differences between the treatment groups 
observed for chemistry, haematology, urinalysis laboratory values, vital signs, ECG, or physical 
examination findings. 
Adolescents 
During the Extension of indication procedure for EoE the data from 75 adolescent participants with EoE 
up to 1 year (exposure from Part B and Part C combined) were already submitted and discussed. 
Table 6 Overall Summary of Number of Adolescent Participants (≥12 to <18 Years of Age) with TEAEs 
During Part B/C 28-Week Treatment Period (Part B/C SAF) 
The incidence of all TEAEs reported in adolescent participants during Part B/C of the study was similar 
across the treatment groups (69.2% to 73.3%). Most TEAEs in adolescent participants were mild or 
moderate in intensity. Two treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 1 adolescent participant in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (Diarrhoea, Rectal tenesmus); these SAEs were 
assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study drug. No adolescent participant experienced a 
TEAE that led to permanent study drug discontinuation during Part B/C of the study. 
During the Extension of indication procedure for EoE the MAH submitted the data from 75 adolescent 
participants with EoE up to 1 year (exposure from Part B and Part C combined). 
Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 70.7% of adolescent 
participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. This was similar to the adult population where 
TEAEs were reported in 65.1% of adult participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. The 
proportion of adolescent participants who experienced a TEAE was similar across the treatment groups, 
ranging from 69.2% (18/26) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 70.0% 
(7/10) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 70.8% (17/24) in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, to 73.3% (11/15) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. 
The majority of TEAEs in both adolescents and adults were mild in intensity.

The most commonly affected system organ class (SOC) in adolescents was General disorders and 
administration site conditions with 33.3% (25/75 adolescent participants), while the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had the lowest incidence (20.0%). This SOC incidence was 
mostly driven by various injection site reaction preferred terms (PTs) including injection site reaction 
(17.3% of adolescent participants), injection site pain (10.7% of adolescent participants), injection site 
erythema (5.3% of adolescent participants), and injection site swelling (5.3% of adolescent 
participants). The proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) was low with 1 
adolescent participant (1.3%) reporting a SAE in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group. 
CHMP comment 
The results from Part B/C have already been submitted and extensively discussed during the Extension 
of Indication for EoE. The SmPC has been modified to address all issues that have been identified in 
this procedure. 
For further discussion of the results see below and EoE Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0062 
eCTD sequence 0160). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study design of the Phase 3 Study R668-EE-1774 carried out as separate sequential independent 
parts was adequate.  
Addendum 2 summarizes the complete data for the Part A/C 12-week follow-up period for Part A/C 
participants and updates to data reported in Part A/C CSR versus data collected through final database 
lock (14 Jul 2022). No new safety findings associated with dupilumab in adult and adolescent 
participants with EoE were identified during the follow-up period or from updates in the data. The 
changes to the Part A/C data are considered minor and are generally consistent with the previous 
findings and conclusions reported. These updates did not impact the overall conclusions regarding the 
efficacy or safety of dupilumab for the treatment of EoE in adult and adolescent participants as 
previously reported. 
The results from Part C (A/C and B/C) of Study R668-EE-1774 show that the improvements in signs 
and symptoms of EoE in participants with substantial disease burden achieved during Part A and B 
were maintained or even further improved with long-term treatment through week 52. In addition, 
participants who switched from placebo to dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part C showed similar 
improvement as participant treated with dupilumab in the previous study parts. The dupilumab 300 mg 
QW dosing regimen is therefore considered to have meaningful benefit for patients with EoE.  
In contrast, in Part B/C dupilumab 300 mg Q2W did not show improvements in clinical symptoms or 
health-related QoL compared with placebo, even though the magnitude of improvements in all 
histologic, endoscopic, and molecular endpoints of EoE were similar to those observed with the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen. 
The safety of the Dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen has already been evaluated in different trials. 
Approximately 3,000 participants have been exposed to dupilumab 300 mg QW mainly in the AD 
indication. No new safety signals associated with the use of dupilumab in participants with EoE were 
identified. The overall safety profile was consistent with that seen in multiple other indications in the 
dupilumab development program (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). 
The SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups was General disorders and 
administration site conditions. Injection site swelling and Injection site bruising met the criteria for

ADRs based on the safety pool results. Injection site reactions, including injection site swelling, are 
already identified ADRs for other approved indications for dupilumab. Although these TEAEs were of 
mild to moderate intensity, there was a high incidence especially in the adolescent participants.  
The rate of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events leading to discontinuation was low in all 
treatment groups and no clear pattern was identified indicating a relationship to the study treatment. 
Overall, the safety profile in adult participants is adequately evaluated and consistent with the safety 
profile of 300 mg QW reported in other indications. In adolescent participants, the rates of TEAEs are 
higher in adolescents compared to the adults and most SAEs were reported in this age group. The 300 
mg QW dose of dupilumab has not been administered to adolescents outside of study R668-EE-1774. 
Data from 10 adolescent participants with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in Study Part A/C and 75 
adolescent participants in Study Part B/C, who completed 52 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg every week 
(QW), were submitted. These participant numbers are considered important especially in the context of 
a rare disease like EoE. The data confirmed a broadly similar safety profile in adolescents with EoE to 
that seen in adults with EoE, even though slightly higher rates of TEAE are suggested.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit risk of the 300mg weekly dose in adults and adolescents can be considered positive for up 
to 52 weeks of treatment. 
The results from Part B/C have already been submitted and discussed during the EoE Type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0062 eCTD sequence 0160). The SmPC has been modified to address issues 
that have been identified.

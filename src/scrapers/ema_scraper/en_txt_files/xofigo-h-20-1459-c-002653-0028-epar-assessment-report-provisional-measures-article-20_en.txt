1.  Information on the procedure 
Analyses of uncleaned preliminary data of a clinical trial evaluating Xofigo in combination with 
abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone in a patient population with asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic prostate cancer (ERA 223 [1]), found that the incidences of treatment emergent fractures 
and deaths were increased in the treatment arm (radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone) compared to the control arm (placebo plus abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone). 
In view of the significance of the findings of the ERA 223 clinical trial, it was considered that they 
should be thoroughly reviewed in the context of all available data related to radium-223 dichloride 
(including evidence from non-authorised use that might impact the authorised use) in order to assess 
their potential impact on the benefit-risk balance of Xofigo in the authorised indication of the treatment 
of adults with castration-resistant prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases and no known 
visceral metastases. 
On 30 November 2017 the EC therefore triggered a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the impact of the 
above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of Xofigo and to issue a recommendation on whether the 
marketing authorisation of this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The current report relates only to provisional measures recommended by the PRAC for radium-223 
dichloride based on the preliminary data available at this time. These provisional measures are without 
prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing review under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
Radium-223 dichloride is an alpha particle-emitter with a half-life of 11.4 days. The six-stage decay of 
radium-223 to lead-207 occurs via short-lived daughters, and is accompanied by a number of alpha, 
beta and gamma emissions with different energies and emission probabilities. The fraction of energy 
emitted from radium-223 and its daughters as alpha-particles is 95.3% (energy range of 5.0−7.5 
MeV). The fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6% (average energies are 0.445 MeV and 0.492 
MeV), and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1% (energy range of 0.01−1.27 MeV). 
Radium-223 dichloride mimics calcium and, after systemic administration, selectively targets bone by 
forming complexes with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. The high linear energy transfer of alpha 
emitters (80 keV/µm) leads to a high frequency of double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breaks 
in adjacent tumour cells, resulting in a potent cytotoxic effect. Additional effects on the tumour 
microenvironment including osteoblasts and osteoclasts also contribute to the in vivo efficacy.  
Xofigo is a radiopharmaceutical containing radium Ra223 dichloride (also radium-223 herein) as active 
substance. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with castration-resistant prostate cancer, 
symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases. Marketing authorisation was granted 
in the European Union (EU) on 13 November 2013. The dose regimen of radium-223 dichloride is an 
activity of 55 kBq per kg body weight, given at 4-week intervals for 6 injections.  
1 Study 15396 (ERA-223); NCT02043678; A phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of radium-223 
dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone in the treatment of asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve subjects with bone predominant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)

Since the first marketing authorisation (United States [US], 15/05/13) until 30 November 2017, it is 
estimated that cumulatively, approximately 41,262 patients have been exposed to the marketed 
product worldwide, of which 15,251 patients are from EU member states. Cumulative exposure to 
radium-223 dichloride in clinical studies until 30 November 2017 is approximately 4,828 subjects 
(2,762 in on-going studies and 2,066 from completed studies). 
The alpha particle range from radium-223 is less than 100 µm (less than 10 cell diameters) which 
minimises damage to the surrounding normal tissue. However, bone marrow toxicity, including 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are recognised adverse drug reactions. In addition, a potential 
signal of a risk of fractures was raised by non-clinical data during the initial marketing authorisation 
application; the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Fractures have not been identified as a 
risk of treatment with radium-223 dichloride and therefore are not identified as a safety concern in the 
risk management plan (RMP). However, the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xofigo 
specifies under warning and precautions that in patients with untreated imminent or established spinal 
cord compression, treatment with standard of care, as clinically indicated, should be completed before 
starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo and further, in patients with bone fractures, orthopaedic 
stabilisation of fractures should be performed before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo. 
On 17 November 2017, the EMA was notified by the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) that Study 
15396 had been un-blinded early on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) because of significant imbalances in fractures and death between the two treatment 
groups. These initial data had been released prior to a survival sweep and data cleaning. Emerging 
analyses from Study 15396 (ERA-223) initially triggered a signal review (EPITT 19132), as an outcome 
of which, at the same time as this Article 20 procedure was started, the PRAC agreed on the wording 
of a “direct healthcare professional communication” (DHPC) together with a communication plan for 
relevant HCPs to be informed of the preliminary results available and be advised not to treat patients 
with radium-223 dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Having assessed analyses submitted by the marketing authorisation holder in responses to the list of 
questions, the PRAC considered that provisional measures were necessary in order to protect public 
health while the review is ongoing. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
The PRAC considered all data submitted by the MAH. This included updated interim analysis of Study 
15396 (ERA-223) and data from the pivotal ALSYMPCA trial [2]. In addition the MAH provided available 
results from a number of completed and ongoing randomised and non-randomised clinical studies 
including, non-interventional studies, investigator-initiated studies and from publications. A summary 
of the most relevant information is included below. 
2.2.1.  Data related to the emerging findings on fractures and deaths 
2.2.1.1.  Study 15396 (ERA-223)  
Study 15396 (ERA 223) is an on-going, randomised, double blind, phase III study, which started on 30 
March 2014. Enrolment was completed in September 2016, the last patient last radium-223 dichloride 
injection was in February 2017 and primary completion as per protocol is anticipated to occur around 
March 2018.  
2 A Phase III Study of radium-223 dichloride in patients with symptomatic hormone refractory prostate cancer with skeletal 
metastases (ALSYMPCA) 
Assessment report on provisional measures

The MAH has now provided updated analyses performed based on the uncleaned data as of 14 
December 2017 after the survival sweep was completed. All death-related analyses included death 
events up to the cut-off date of 24 November 2017, which is the starting date of the survival sweep. 
Most of the additional death events occurred before the death cut-off date of 24 November 17. Any 
other analyses included all data up to 14 December 2017. Data cleaning activity and central 
radiological review of fractures, which had been initiated after the imbalance in incidence of fractures 
had become apparent, is still on-going. Additional analyses of clinical data including clinical response 
markers (e.g. prostate-specific antigen [PSA]/ alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), time to non-bone 
progression, treatment emergent adverse events leading to any treatment discontinuation/dose 
modifications, summary of all fractures for patients with exposure to denosumab/bisphosphonates, 
treatment duration of bone health agents (BHAs), and lab abnormalities are also still expected. 
2.2.1.1.1.  Patients 
The study enrolled asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, chemotherapy-naïve patients with bone 
predominant metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Asymptomatic was defined as a 
worst pain score (WPS) of 0 on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form Question #3 (worst pain in last 24 
hours) and mildly symptomatic was defined as a WPS of 1-3; 46% of patients in the study were mildly 
symptomatic patients. Maintenance of testosterone to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) was required 
through medical (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] analogues) or surgical castration. 
2.2.1.1.2.  Study design 
Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The study period 
consists of screening/randomization 1:1, treatment period, active follow-up with clinic visits, active 
follow-up without clinic visits and long-term follow-up phases. 
The treatment period consisted of two phases:  
• 
Treatment with up to 6 cycles of intravenous (IV) administrations of radium-223 dichloride 55 
kBq/kg body weight (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B), each separated by an interval of 4 weeks, plus 
abiraterone acetate 1000 mg every day plus prednisone/prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Radium-
223 dichloride/placebo treatment was started on the same day as the abiraterone/prednisone 
treatment and used concurrently. 
•  Ongoing treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone. After completion of treatment 
with radium-223 dichloride (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B), all randomized subjects will continue to 
receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg every day plus prednisone/prednisolone 5 mg twice daily until 
an on-study symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) occurs (or other withdrawal criteria are met).

Of the 136 deaths in the radium-223 group: 
- 2 deaths occurred in the treatment phase, before or on the last dose date of radium-223 (+ 30 days) 
- 19 deaths occurred in the treatment phase, before or on the last dose date of treatment with 
abiraterone/prednisone (+ 30 days)

- 115 deaths occurred after the last dose date of treatment with radium-223 and/or abiraterone 
acetate + prednisolone/prednisone (+30 days). 
Death due to progressive disease was reported as the main reason for the imbalance in deaths 
observed between the treatment arms (Table 2). It is not known at this stage whether the deaths due 
to disease progression in the radium-223 group were due to bone progression or progression in soft 
tissue/visceral disease. 
Table 2. Primary cause of death (safety analysis set) 
In the safety analysis set, most deaths in the radium-223 (97/136 [71%]) and placebo groups (99/111 
[89%]) occurred without any prior fracture reported (Table 3).

In the safety analysis set, a higher proportion of patients in the radium-223 group had at least 1 
fracture than in the placebo group (102/392 [26.0%] vs 32/394 [8.1%]) (Table 1). The Kaplan-Meier 
figure of time to fracture is shown below (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier figure of time to first fracture 
In the radium-223 group, of the 102 patients who had ≥1 fracture: 
- 22 (21.5%) had a fracture in the treatment period, before or on the last radium-223 dose 
- 69 (67.5%) had a fracture in the treatment period, after concurrent treatment with radium-223 
dichloride plus abiraterone/prednisone and before the last dose of subsequent abiraterone/prednisone 
treatment.  
- 11 patients (11%) had a fracture that was reported after the last study dose (radium-223 and/or 
abiraterone acetate/prednisolone).   
Radiological review of all fractures is currently on-going. Data from the first batch including 80 scans 
from 54 patients suggest that fractures occurred both at sites of metastases and outside of bone 
metastases. 
2.2.1.1.3.3.  Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival 
A summary of SSE-FS events by components ((1) an on-study SSE, which is defined as: a. the use of 
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal symptoms, b. the occurrence of new 
symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral), c. the occurrence of spinal cord 
compression, d. a tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention; or (2) death from any cause) 
indicate that the most notable differences between the two treatment arms are an increased incidence 
of symptomatic pathological fracture (9.7% vs 3.7%) and death (34.7% vs 27.4%) in the radium-223 
group compared to the placebo group. There was a slightly lower frequency of spinal cord compression 
events in the radium-223 group compared to the placebo group.

In two of the studies, 16544 and 15469, the sample sizes were small (63 patients treated in each 
study) and there was a high degree of censoring for the OS endpoint. 
Study 16507 is a randomized, 3-arm, open-label Phase 2 study that evaluated 3 different doses. The 
proportion of patients with an SSE-bone fracture was increased in the high dose (9/130 [10.6%]) and 
extended dose (10/131 [10.9%]) groups compared to the standard dosing group, (1/130 [5.0%]). 
The pivotal Phase III study, ALSYMPCA was a randomized (2:1), double blind, placebo controlled 
multinational study of radium-223 plus best standard of care (BSC) compared with placebo plus BSC in 
CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases. Analyses submitted to support the marketing 
authorisation application are presented and discussed further below (see section 2.2.3. and 2.2.4.). 
The incidence of all fractures was similar in the radium-223 and placebo arms (6.5% vs 6.6%). 
2.2.1.3.  Data from non-randomised clinical studies 
Based on the ALSYMPCA trial, two clinical studies (Expanded Access Program) were conducted in order 
to provide access to radium-223 dichloride for patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer patients 
with bone metastases prior to reimbursement decisions by national health services. Study 15995

(NCT01516762 [3]) was conducted in the US, and Study 16216 (NCT01618370 [4]) was conducted 
outside of the US.  
Several non-interventional clinical studies investigating the efficacy and/or safety of radium-223 
dichloride are currently ongoing. Preliminary data from the global REASSURE study (5) and the 
PARABO study (6) conducted in Germany only are available. In addition, several Real-World (RW) 
datasets should provide information on current treatment patterns of radium-223 dichloride in real-life 
use: the Navigant study (7) and the FlatIron Database (8). However, results of the Navigant study and 
FlatIron RW database are not available yet. 
If all patients from all studies are pooled, 449 out of 3449 (13.0%) patients received abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone together with radium-223 dichloride. However the baseline 
characteristics of all patients in the above studies vary widely in terms of lines of treatment received 
before therapy with radium-223 dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone. The use in combination in these studies refers to any overlap between the 
treatment of abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone and radium-223 regardless of timing of 
initiation. This is not identical to the study design of ERA-223 where both medicinal products were 
started at the same time. In the REASSURE study 3 out of 73 patients (4.1%) started radium-223 
dichloride within the first month of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone, which would 
correspond to the situation of the ERA-223 trial. The interim data from REASSURE also indicate 
significant concomitant use with the anti-androgen enzalutamide (22%). Interim analysis from this 
study also shows concomitant use of corticosteroids and radium-223 in 21% (124/583) of patients. 
In Study 15995 (US Early Access Program), 184 patients received at least one dose of radium-223. 
Concurrent abiraterone was administered to 25 of 184 (14%) patients (Sartor, 2017). Patients had 
symptomatic, progressive, bone-predominant mCRPC with ≥ 2 bone metastases on imaging with no 
lung, liver, or brain metastases. The incidence of deaths was lower in the subgroup with concurrent 
abiraterone compared to the total population (4/25 [16%] vs 50/184 [27%]). There were few 
pathological fractures (4 in the total population, including 1 in the subgroup with concurrent 
abiraterone) and only 1.1% of patients had a non-pathological fracture during the treatment period. 
In Study 16216 (international Early Access Program) of 708 patients who received radium-223, 119 
(17%) received concomitant abiraterone (Saad, 2016). Patient eligibility criteria were similar to the 
ALSYMPCA trial, although unlike ALSYMPCA, asymptomatic patients were eligible for this study. The 
incidence of deaths was lower in the subgroup with concurrent abiraterone compared to the total 
population (31/119 [26%]) vs 224/708 [32%]).  
2.2.2.  Discussion on the emerging findings related to fractures and deaths 
Based on the available data, Study 15396 shows that in chemotherapy-naïve asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic patients with CRPC, radium-223 in combination with concurrent abiraterone acetate and 
prednisolone/prednisone decreases overall survival and increases the risk of fractures compared to

placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone. Important prognostic 
factors were balanced between the two groups at baseline. Also, the use of BHAs was balanced at 
baseline (~ 40%) and these medicines could not be started during the study. Therefore, the observed 
results are unlikely to be due to bias. In addition, the median OS in the control group in Study 15396 
(33.3 months) is similar to the median OS in the abiraterone + prednisone group in COU-AA-302 (34.7 
months; abiraterone product information) (9), adding to the validity of the results. While a similar 
signal was not seen in other studies where radium-223 was administered in combination with 
concurrent abiraterone acetate and prednisolone/prednisone, only a small proportion of patients in 
these studies started the combination at the same time, as was the case in ERA-223. Further, 
these studies have important limitations either in term of sample size and censoring for the OS 
endpoint or the absence of control group, the absence of random assignment or blinding, small 
subgroup of patients with concomitant abiraterone acetate, short follow up and the potential for 
selection bias i.e. patients with better prognosis being selected for combination treatment. 
The higher risk of death in the radium-223 group in study 15396 appears to be driven by a higher 
incidence of disease progression as a cause of death. However it is not excluded at this stage 
that fractures may be an important contributory factor to the increased risk of death. Further other 
unknown factors may also have contributed. Subgroup analysis, which should be interpreted with 
caution, suggests that bone health agents (BHAs) did not mitigate the increased risk of death in the 
radium-223 group; further analyses are required to try to establish if this is correct. 
For the majority of patients who experienced a fracture, the fracture occurred after their final dose of 
radium-223. This delayed occurrence of fractures has been observed with post-radiation therapy 
fractures, which can occur several months after radiation is administered (Shimoyama, 2017 [10]). 
Data from a post hoc subgroup analysis, which should therefore be interpreted with caution, suggest 
that the use of BHA was associated with a reduced risk of fractures (symptomatic pathological 
fractures and non-SSE fractures) in both treatment groups of study ERA-223. Based on this post hoc 
analysis the use of BHA seems to also reduce the risk of the SSE-FS events external beam 
radiotherapy and to a lesser extent tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention, but not spinal 
cord compression and death in the radium-223 treatment arm. Further, the use of BHA appeared to 
eliminate the increased risk of symptomatic pathological fractures in the radium-223 group compared 
to the placebo group. No clear predictive baseline characteristic for fractures has been identified so far, 
except for concurrent use of BHA which appeared to reduce the risk of fractures in both arms. 
Nonetheless, another post hoc, subgroup analysis, suggest that in the radium-223 group, the risk of 
fracture appears to be higher in patients with <6 bone metastases compared to patients with ≥6 bone 
metastases. 
Fractures (other than pathological fractures) are a recognised risk of treatment with abiraterone 
acetate (Zytiga SmPC). Unlike other anti-androgens, abiraterone blocks the synthesis of androgens 
and subsequently reduces oestrogen levels, thereby inhibiting osteoblasts and increasing osteoclast net 
activity. An abiraterone study, COU-301, in a post-docetaxel metastatic CRPC population, showed that 
the incidence of pathological fractures was higher in the abiraterone acetate + prednisone group than 
the placebo + prednisone group (15.3% vs 6.2%). However, this increase in the risk of pathological 
fractures should be interpreted with caution. BHAs were allowed to be initiated during the study in case 
of new skeletal event or bone progression, therefore, imbalances in the use of BHAs may have 
confounded the results (Logothetis, 2012 [11]). Furthermore, although prednisone (5 mg twice a day)

was administered in both arms of the study, the median duration of treatment in the abiraterone group 
was twice that of the placebo group (8 cycles vs. 4 cycles) (Zytiga EPAR, Procedure No.: 
EMEA/H/C/002321). At this stage it is not excluded that the concurrent administration of radium-223 + 
abiraterone + prednisolone/prednisone is critical to the subsequent increased risk of fractures 
observed in study ERA-223. 
Fractures are also a known risk for second-generation androgen receptor antagonists such as 
enzalutamide (Xtandi SmPC). The on-going PEACE-3 trial, which is comparing radium-223 in 
combination with enzalutamide in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic CRPC patients, has not raised 
any signals regarding fractures and death; however, there are only 50 evaluable patients, therefore no 
conclusion can be made at this stage. The study aims to enrol 560 patients and the estimated study 
completion date is April 2021 (12).  
Fractures are furthermore a known risk with first-generation androgen receptor antagonists such as 
flutamide, especially when combined with LHRH analogues (flutamide SmPC). About 15% of patients in 
the radium-223 group in the pivotal study, ALSYMPCA, received concomitant first-generation androgen 
receptor antagonists in the treatment phase. While it cannot be excluded that the risk of fractures 
observed when radium-223 is combined concurrently with abiraterone acetate also extends to other 
androgen receptor antagonists, in view of the population in which radium-223 is currently authorised, 
it is not expected that it would be administered as part of combination therapy with first-generation 
androgen receptor antagonists in clinical practice.  
Based on data from the observational study REASSURE, it appears that radium-223 is combined to 
some extent with other anti-androgens in clinical practice, notably abiraterone and enzalutamide.  
2.2.3.  Data on efficacy in the authorised indication 
The clinical efficacy of radium-223 dichloride in the authorised indication had been established during 
the initial marketing authorisation application based on the assessment of data from one pivotal Phase 
III study (15245/BC1-06, ALSYMPCA).  
The study was conducted in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone 
metastases. Symptomatic was defined as either regular (not occasional) use of analgesic medication 
for cancer related bone pain (≥ level 1; WHO ladder for cancer pain), or treatment with EBRT for bone 
pain (the EBRT should have been within previous 12 weeks before randomisation). The study included 
41.9% of mildly symptomatic patients. 
Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either radium-223 dichloride or placebo. Other treatments for 
prostate cancer, best standard of care (BSC), could be used in accordance with routine clinical practice, 
at the discretion of the Investigator. BSC included local external beam radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, 
corticosteroids, oestrogens, estramustine, ketoconazole or anti-androgens (bicalutamide, flutamide and 
nilutamide). 40% of patients were receiving bone health agents at baseline and up to 51% in the 
follow-up period. Approximately 15% of patients received a first-generation anti-androgen (e.g. 
bicalutamide) in the treatment phase and approximately 40% to 60% received concomitant 
corticosteroids at different stages of the study. When this study was being conducted, abiraterone 
acetate and enzalutamide were not authorised. 
The results of both the interim and updated analysis had shown that overall survival was significantly 
longer in patients treated with radium-223 plus BSC compared to patients treated with placebo plus 
BSC (Table 8 and Figure 3).

The results of the interim analysis and the updated analysis had also shown a significant improvement 
in all main secondary endpoints in the radium-223 arm compared to the placebo arm, although the 
effect of delaying median PSA progression (median 0.2 months) was small (Table 9).

2.2.4.  Discussion on efficacy in the authorised indication 
In the single pivotal Phase III, placebo-controlled study in symptomatic patients with bone metastases 
from CRPC without visceral metastases, overall survival was longer in the radium-223 group compared 
to the placebo group by 2.8 months, based on the pre-specified interim analysis (HR 0.695, 95% CI 
0.552-0.875, p=0.00185). The OS benefit persisted after correcting for baseline imbalances. Also, 
treatment of patients with radium-223 delayed the composite endpoint symptomatic skeletal events 
compared to placebo (median 13.5 months vs 8.4 months). At the time of authorisation, several 
uncertainties about the benefits of radium-223 dichloride were recognised, including but not limited to 
the absence of demonstration of a direct anti-tumour effect and to the potential impact of co-
medication (e.g. bisphosphonates) on skeletal-related events. 
The PRAC noted that radium-223 was an add-on to BSC in the pivotal clinical trial ALSYMPCA. 
However, several new medicinal products (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide) have been authorised for 
metastatic CRPC in the meantime, therefore it is difficult to put the beneficial effects of a bone-specific 
agent into context with current treatment standards. The PRAC also noted that overall survival analysis 
(including Kaplan-Meier graph) for the end of the follow-up period (database lock 10 October 2014) 
should be provided by the MAH.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride) is a centrally authorised product indicated for the treatment of adults 
with castration-resistant prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral 
metastases.  
The PRAC considered preliminary data analyses from a randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre 
phase III study (15396/ERA-223) in chemotherapy-naïve patients with asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic castration resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases (CRPC). The PRAC also 
considered data from the pivotal clinical trial ALSYMPCA which supported the marketing authorisation 
of Xofigo, as well as data from other completed and ongoing studies which became available since the 
marketing authorisation. 
The clinical efficacy of radium-223 dichloride in the authorised indication was established during the 
initial marketing authorisation application based on the assessment of data from one pivotal phase III 
study (15245/BC1-06, ALSYMPCA), in which an improved overall survival and delayed symptomatic 
skeletal events were observed. 
Based on the available data, Study 15396 shows that in chemotherapy-naïve asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic patients with CRPC, radium-223 in combination with concurrent abiraterone acetate and 
prednisolone/prednisone decreases overall survival and increases the risk of fractures compared to 
placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone. The PRAC concluded 
that the risks observed were unlikely to be due to bias.   
Whilst the exact extent of use of radium-223 in combination with abiraterone acetate and 
prednisolone/prednisone in clinical practice is not known, interim data from an observational study 
(REASSURE) reported that 5% of patients were treated with this combination. In view of the 
seriousness of these results, the fact that they were observed in a patient population with earlier 
disease characteristics but partly overlapping with that described in the authorised indication, and 
considering that the mechanism behind the events observed remain largely unexplained at this stage, 
the PRAC considered that, as a provisional measure, the use of radium-223 in combination with 
abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone should be contraindicated. Healthcare professionals 
should be informed of the increased incidence of fractures and deaths among patients receiving Xofigo 
in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients receiving 
placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone in Study ERA-223, and 
of the reduced incidence of fractures observed in both treatment arms with concurrent use of 
bisphosphonates or denosumab bone health agents. 
Whilst at this stage it is not excluded that the concurrent administration of radium-223 + abiraterone 
+ prednisolone/prednisone is critical to the subsequent increased risks of fractures and death, it 
cannot be excluded either that the risks observed could apply to other effective androgen receptor 
antagonists. Interim results of the REASSURE study report also a significant concomitant use with 
enzalutamide in clinical practice (22%). Considering current therapeutic options available for patients 
with symptomatic castration resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases, the PRAC considered that 
as a provisional measure, a warning that the safety and efficacy of Xofigo in combination with 
second-generation androgen receptor antagonists such as enzalutamide have not been established, 
should be included in the product information.  
These recommendations should be reflected in the product information and communicated to 
healthcare professionals via a dedicated letter. These measures will be further reviewed as part of the 
ongoing Article 20 procedure.

4.  Risk management 
4.1.  Risk minimisation activities  
4.1.1.  Amendments to the product information 
The PRAC considered that provisional routine risk minimisation measures in the form of updates to the 
product information would be necessary in order to minimise the risks of fractures and death 
associated with the use of radium-223 dichloride treatment initiated concurrently with abiraterone 
acetate and prednisone/prednisolone treatment. These changes include amendments to sections 4.3, 
4.4, and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The PRAC considered that radium-223 dichloride should be contraindicated in combination with 
abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone  
Further warnings and precautions of use relating to the risks of fracture and death among patients 
receiving Xofigo in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone were also 
included together with important information that the safety and efficacy of combination with 
second-generation androgen receptor antagonists (e.g. enzalutamide) have not been established. 
The Package Leaflet was amended accordingly. 
4.1.2.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communications/Communication 
plan 
The PRAC adopted the wording of a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) to inform 
healthcare professionals of the recommended temporary contraindication and warnings regarding 
radium-223 dichloride. 
5.  Grounds for Recommendation 
Whereas, 
• 
• 
The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting 
from pharmacovigilance data, in particular regarding the need for provisional measures in 
accordance with Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Xofigo (radium Ra223 
dichloride) and taking into account the grounds set out in Articles 116 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The PRAC reviewed the preliminary data analyses of Study ERA 223 that suggested an 
increased risk of fracture and mortality when radium Ra223 dichloride treatment, compared to 
placebo, is initiated concurrently with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone 
treatment. The PRAC also considered other available data, including further data from the 
ALSYMPCA clinical trial submitted in support of the initial marketing authorisation, in relation to 
the potential impact of results of Study ERA 223 on the benefit-risk balance of radium Ra223 
dichloride in its authorised indication. 
• 
The PRAC noted that the use of radium Ra223 dichloride in Study ERA 223 was at earlier 
stages of the disease, albeit partially overlapping with that included in the authorised 
indication. The PRAC also noted that data available show that radium Ra223 dichloride is used 
to some extent in clinical practice in combination with anti-androgens such as abiraterone and 
enzalutamide. 
Assessment report on provisional measures  
EMA/170170/2018 
Page 18/19 
 
 
 
 
• 
Further to the review of the preliminary analyses available, the underlying mechanism for the 
increased risks of fracture and mortality observed in ERA 233, and therefore the potential 
impact of these findings in the authorised indication, remain uncertain. Therefore and in view 
of the seriousness of the events observed, the PRAC recommended provisional amendments to 
the product information to contraindicate the use of radium Ra223 dichloride in combination 
with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone and inform on the results of Study 
ERA 223.   
• 
In addition, in the absence of definite evidence that the results observed were specific to the 
combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone, the PRAC considered that 
healthcare professionals and patients should be warned that the safety and efficacy of radium 
Ra223 dichloride in combination with second-generation androgen receptor antagonists 
including enzalutamide have not been established. 
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of Xofigo (radium Ra223 
dichloride) remains favourable subject to the agreed provisional amendments to the product 
information. The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the 
marketing authorisation for Xofigo (radium Ra223 dichloride). 
This recommendation is without prejudice to the final conclusions of the ongoing procedure under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

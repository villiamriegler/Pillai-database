2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary cutaneous lymphoma’s (PCL) are defined as non-Hodgkin lymphoma that present in the skin 
with no evidence of extra-cutaneous disease at diagnosis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In Western countries the estimated annual incidence of PCL is around 1/100.000 and CTCL represent 
approximately 75 to 80 percent of all PCLs. CTCL is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms of skin-
homing T cells that show considerable variation in clinical presentation, histologic appearance and 
prognosis.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The most common type of CTCL (50-60%) is mycosis fungoides (MF) and its histological variants. 
Classic MF is an epidermotropic CTCL clinically characterised by the progression from patch stage to 
plaques stage and lastly to tumour stage. In the literature, the percentage of CD30 positive cells in MF 
greatly varies (0-80%), but is usually low. The peak age is between 55 and 60 years and the incidence 
is between 1/350.000 and 1/110.000 (Orphanet).  
Other CTCL subtypes 
Sezary syndrome (SS, 3% of CTCL) is a leukaemia closely related to MF and should be treated with 
systemic treatment, such as IFN, retinoids, TSEBT and ECP. Some of the other rarely occurring 
subtypes also have an aggressive course with poor prognosis and require extensive systemic therapy 
or multi-agent chemotherapy (e.g. primary CTCL NOS, pc ɣδ T-cell lymphoma (though rare case with 
indolent course have been reported), extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma nasal type). While other subtypes 
(subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma, pc CD4+ small/medium sized pleomorphic T cell 
lymphoma proliferative disorder and pc acral CD8+ T cell lymphoma) have excellent prognoses. CD30 
expression has been observed for o.a. SS with a median 10% of cells positive. CD30 expression has 
also been described in PTCL NOS and extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma in various levels, though 
literature, as these subtypes, is scarce. 
Background CD30 
CD30 is a type I transmembrane glycosylated protein and a member of the tumour-necrosis factor 
receptor superfamily. It was originally identified on Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin Lymphoma, but is 
also expressed on cell subsets of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
and CTCL as well as on embryonal carcinomas. The CTCL subtype “primary cutaneous 
CD30+lymphoproliferative disorders” (LPD) have (per definition) a strong and homogenous 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 7/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CD30expression. Other CTCL subtypes may also express CD30 expression, however, at much lower 
and variable levels. Other subtypes in which CD30 expression is observed are MF, PTCL NOS and 
extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma. 
In non-malignant cells, CD30 is expressed on activated (T, B and NK cells), in lower levels of 
expression on activated macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils and in negligible expression on 
naïve or resting lymphocytes. The CD30 signalling pathway mainly activates MAP kinases and NF-κB, 
which can promote cell proliferation and survival as well as induction of anti-proliferative responses 
and cell death, depending on the cell type and the co-stimulatory signals involved.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and prognosis  
Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) (>75% expression of CD30) are the 
second most common group of CTCL, accounting for around 30 percent. This group mainly constitutes 
of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) (13%) and lymphomatoid papulosis 
(LyP) (19%). PcALCL presents with (ulcerating) skin tumours up to several centimetres. The mean age 
at presentation is 60 years. The exact incidence of pcALCL is unknown. PcALCL has considerable 
overlap with LyP, which is a recurrent, chronic, but (mostly) self-limiting disease. 
Prognosis 
MF is a disease with a persistent and relapsing course and prognosis is stage dependent. MF stage IA 
or IB has excellent prognosis, however progression to advanced stages occurs in around 25% of the 
patients. MF Stage IIB and III has a median survival of 4-6 years and stage IV has a poor prognosis 
with a median survival of less than 4 years. The prognosis for LPD is excellent with a ten year survival 
of 90% for pcALCL and 100% for Lyp. Up to 40% of the pcALCL localised lesions show some 
spontaneous regression. Most patients with pcALCL will attain a CR following initial therapy, however, 
recurrences occur often (>40%) and patients can experience serial relapses. Extra-cutaneous spread 
occurs in up to 13% at time of relapse. 
Management  
Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of PCL controlled trials are rare, there is no standard initial 
therapy. The early stages of MF can be managed with skin direct therapies (e.g. topical steroids, 
psoralens +UVA [PUVA], UVB, topical cytostatic agents, local electron beam therapy [EBT]). Ledaga 
(chlormethine as gel) was recently approved by the EMA for the topical treatment of mycosis 
fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL) in adult patients. In advanced stages (IIB-
IV) recommended options include, in combination or alone: total skin EBT (CR44-74%), PUVA (CR 30-
70%), interferon (RR30-60%) and retinoids (RR45-55%) including (second line option) bexarotene 
(RR30-50%). Many clinicians administer oral methotrexate in refractory (RR ±35%) or in advanced 
stage disease (RR30-50%), however methotrexate is currently not recommended for MF by the ESMO. 
In advanced refractory disease gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin (RR 40-80%) could be 
considered. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with extensive disease (stage IV).  
Although a broad spectrum of therapy regimens has been reported, these have been limited to small 
cohort series or case reports. PcALCL patients with isolated lesions should receive surgical excision or 
radiation, which can be again used in case of recurrence. With multiple recurrences and/or multiple 
lesions systemic therapy is recommended due to the morbidity of repeated surgery/radiation. First 
choice is oral methotrexate (RR 87%). Patients often have recurrence after discontinuation. In case of 
progression bexarotene (RR ±50% in CTCL patients) and interferon (RR 60% in CTCL patients) are

options. In case of wide spread nodal or visceral involvement or refractory disease gemcitabine and 
etoposide are options. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients presenting with extra-
cutaneous disease or rapidly progressive skin disease (rare). 
About the product 
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the monoclonal 
antibody (cAC10) covalently linked, via an enzyme-cleavable linker, to the antimitotic small molecule 
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Binding of the ADC to CD30 on the cell surface initiates 
internalisation of the ADC-CD30 complex, which then traffics to the lysosomal compartment. Within 
the cell MMAE is released via proteolytic cleavage and degradation of the drug linker. Binding of MMAE 
to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, induces cell cycle arrest and results in 
apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumour cell.  
A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for Adcetris was granted in October 2012 for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) CD30+ HL following autologous stem cell 
transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is 
not a treatment option. It is also indicated for the treatment of r/r systemic anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (sALCL). Specific obligations related to the CMA include OS follow up data for the sALCL 
population, post-authorisation safety data in HL and sALCL and performing single arm studies in similar 
sALCL patients and r/r HL patients not eligible for ASCT. 
In May 2016 Adcetris was approved for patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse or 
progression following ASCT.  
The current Type II variation was submitted for the following extension of the indication: 
“Adcetris is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
(CTCL) who require systemic therapy” 
Extension of indication to include the new indication “ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who require systemic therapy”, based on data 
from study C25001 (the ‘ALCANZA’ study): “A Phase 3 Trial of brentuximab vedotin(SGN-35) Versus 
Physician's Choice (Methotrexate or Bexarotene) in Patients With CD30-Positive Cutaneous T-Cell 
Lymphoma” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Brentuximab vedotin is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in 
the environment. Thus, according to the "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use" (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), brentuximab vedotin is exempt from the 
submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose 
a significant risk to the environment. Concerning the antimitotic small molecule MMAE, the 
PECsurfacewater calculation was adapted to include the newly added indication. The PECsurfacewater 
value is 0.0029 ug/L, which is below the trigger value for a phase II assessment. Overall, it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 9/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considered that no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated with brentuximab 
vedotin. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted for this application which is considered acceptable. 
Brentuximab vedotin is not considered to pose a significant risk to the environment. Brentuximab 
vedotin should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any 
potential risks to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the non-clinical data already submitted in the previous variations and the 
updated ERA are sufficient to address the non-clinical aspects of this application.

This section therefore only summarizes additional findings from the Phase 3 study C25001 (ALCANZA) 
in (CTCL subtype) MF and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL) patients. 
Relevant PK and pharmacodynamic secondary and exploratory objectives in Study C25001 were: 
 
 
 
To further describe the PK of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE in blood. 
To further determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin. 
To investigate possible correlations between expression of serum protein markers and 
response.  
Distribution 
PK parameters of brentuximab vedotin ADC from Study C25001 
PK results for Cmax and Ctrough of brentuximab vedotin ADC from Study C25001 are presented in 
Table 2 by individual and combined disease subgroups (pcALCL and MF). A concentration versus time 
curve showing median serum concentration of brentuximab vedotin is displayed in Figure 1.

of MMAE is displayed in Figure 3. Due to the sparse PK sampling scheme used in this study, PK 
samples were not obtained 24 hours post infusion after Cycle 3, which explains the apparent lower 
Cmax for MMAE in these cycles.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling 
Data obtained from Study C25001 were used in the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models for 
brentuximab vedotin ADCand MMAE. These models were built based on PK data collected in adult 
patients with CD30+ malignancies who received brentuximab vedotin. There were 380 patients in the 
dataset, which included data from patients with CTCL, i.e., MF, pcALCL, in Study C25001 combined 
with data from patients enrolled in 5 other studies with various tumour types (Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and other hematologic malignancies) (SG035-0001, 
SG035-0002, SG035-0003, SG035-0004, C25007). 
The objectives of the PopPK modelling were: 
1. To understand the impact of various patient factors (covariates) on the PK of the brentuximab 
vedotin ADC and MMAE. 
2. To use the PopPK models to summarize the systemic exposures of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE 
in patients with CTCL in Study C25001. 
3. To provide a quantitative framework for derivation of individual patient-level exposure metrics for 
subsequent use in exposure-response analyses of efficacy and safety in Study C25001. 
Methodology 
Baseline demographic and characteristics data of the patients included in the PopPK model are 
summarised in Table 5 and Table 6. Age distribution for Study C25001 is depicted in Table 7.

The population PK model was developed using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. NONMEM 
7.3 software with the first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE) was used.  
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as gender, body weight, race, age, ethnicity, disease, 
baseline albumin levels, baseline tumour size, indicators of renal and hepatic function, 
immunogenicity, and manufacturing process on the PK of ADC and MMAE were explored in the PopPK 
model. 
The concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE after treatment with brentuximab vedotin 
have been modelled previously with data available at the time of the original MAA. These previously 
developed models were used as the structural base models for the current analysis, which includes 
additional data from Study C25001 (ALCANZA) and Study C25007. 
These previous PopPK models for ADC and MMAE were based on a base model which included 
structural components of the model, which was used to conduct a graphical evaluation of the 
covariates. Covariates that showed a graphical trend or required further evaluation based on 
physiological relevance or observation during previous clinical trials of BV were tested as single 
covariate models (p<0.01). A full model including all of the statistically relevant pre-specified covariate 
effects of interest was then developed. A final model was chosen by retaining only the statistically 
significant covariate effects (p<0.001). The magnitude of the impact of the covariates was also 
considered, if the magnitude of the impact was small (less than a 20% change over the range of 
covariate values in the database) or the covariate effect was poorly estimated [e.g., standard error 
(SE) > 45%] then the covariate was allowed to be reparameterised or discarded.  
The final basic structural model was selected on the basis of goodness-of-fit as judged by change in 
objective function (OBJ), and various diagnostic plots [predicted(PRED)/individual predicted (IPRED) 
versus observed concentrations, WRES/individual weighted residuals (IWRES) versus time, 
WRES/IWRES versus PRED/IPRED]. CWRES was used in lieu of or in addition to WRES. 
Data from the 6 studies used in the analysis included 22,660 records with 3,450 dosing records and 
19,210 concentration records. Of the concentration records 9,541 were for ADC and 9,669 were for 
MMAE. Overall there were 1,287 concentration records that were BLQ, 649 MMAE (6.7%) and 638 ADC 
(6.7%) and about half (359 for ADC and 356 for MMAE) of these records were pre-dose 
concentrations. Therefore approximately 3% (279 for ADC and 393 for MMAE) of the post dose records 
for each analyte were BLQ. Due to the low proportion of BLQ records in the dataset, these were 
ignored. 
The patients in C25001 were generally the oldest patients in the dataset. The median age for the 
patients in the entire dataset was 37 years old (mean 42 years) and the median age for patients in 
C25001 was 61 years old (mean 59 years).  
ADC model 
A schematic of the ADC PK model is shown in Figure 4 below and was based on the previous analysis. 
The model for brentuximab vedotin ADC PK was a linear 3-compartment model with zero-order input 
and first-order elimination.

The final model included the effect of pcALCL tumour type on CL, anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) on 
CL, albumin (ALB) on CL, and body surface area (BSA) on CL and central volume of distribution (Vc). 
There were 3 possible ATA status values in the database (positive, negative, or missing) with the base 
value (no additional parameters) for patients who had negative ATA status. Separate parameters were 
estimated for patients with missing values, patients from the older studies (SG035-0001, SG035- 
0002, SG035-0003, and SG035-0004) with positive values, and patients from the newer studies 
(C25001 and C25007) with positive values. 
The results showed that ATA-positivity status, regardless of the assay used, consistently resulted in 
fractionally higher CLs. Further, patients with pcALCL (N=16) showed higher concentrations than 
patients with other tumour types. A pcALCL tumour-type effect was added to CL and resulted in a 
lower CL than the non-pcALCL patients. The other covariate effects in the model showed that 
brentuximab vedotin ADC CL and Vc increase with increasing body size, and brentuximab vedotin ADC 
CL decreases with increasing ALB concentration. The final brentuximab vedotin ADC model parameter 
estimates are shown in Table 8.

The final PopPK model was evaluated by the Visual Predictive Check (VPC) method. For the VPC 
evaluation, the 2.5th and 97.5th prediction intervals (PIs) were constructed by simulating replicates of 
the dataset from which the model was developed. The observed data were then overlaid and compared

with the PIs. For the model to be acceptable, approximately 2.5% of the observed data should lie 
above the 97.5th PI, and 2.5% should lie below the 2.5th PI. The combined data from all the studies 
as shown in Figure 5 were well predicted by the model. The observed and predicted 95% PI are similar 
and generally within the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the PI. Overall, the simulated 
concentrations appeared to be reasonably consistent with the observed concentrations, with no 
systematic bias.

The final PK model for ADC was used to simulate the concentrations produced after a 1.8 mg/kg dose 
of BV every 21 days for 3 cycles. The dose was capped at 180 mg for patients weighing more than 100 
kg. The results showed/confirmed that there is minor accumulation of ADC with this dosing regimen. 
Simulation of the AUCs in the various tumour types indicated a 35% estimated higher geometric mean 
AUC in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types in the overall population, and 16% higher AUC in patients 
with MF in C25001 compared with patients with HL in Study C25007) (Figure 6).

The  model  for  MMAE  included  a  link  to  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  elimination  using  the  individual 
parameter  estimates  from  the  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  model  to  predict  the  brentuximab  vedotin 
ADC  concentrations  in  the  MMAE  model.  The  PK  of  MMAE  was  described  by  a  2-compartment  model 
with  first-order  elimination  and  formation  of  MMAE  both  directly  from  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  and 
through  binding  of  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  to  a  hypothetical  target.  The  model  had  a  lag 
compartment to describe the delay in formation of MMAE, both directly from brentuximab vedotin ADC 
and through binding of brentuximab vedotin ADC to the target. The fraction of MMAE formed directly 
from  brentuximab vedotin ADC decreased following brentuximab vedotin ADC administration, relative 
to time after dose.

The  final  MMAE  model  included  creatinine  concentration,  BSA,  bilirubin  concentration,  and  albumin 
(ALB)  concentration  on  CL;  and  BSA  on  Vc.  Specifically  MMAE  CL  increases  with  increasing  ALB 
concentration,  and  MMAE  CL  decreases  with  increasing  creatinine  and  bilirubin  concentration.  This 
indicates  that  renal  function  shows  a  positive  relationship  with  MMAE  CL  where  higher  values  of 
creatinine  CL  resulted  in  higher  MMAE  CL.  Hepatic  function  as  assessed  by  bilirubin  concentration 
showed that higher bilirubin concentrations, an indicator of lower hepatic function, showed a trend for 
lower  MMAE  CL.  In  addition,  the  model  results  showed  that  the  Vc  is  consistently  larger  for  larger 
patients based on BSA. The pcALCL tumour type was not found to be a statistically significant predictor 
of MMAE CL. Overall the MMAE model had acceptable precision of parameter estimates. The final MMAE 
model parameter estimates are shown in Table 9. 
Table 9: 
MMAE final PK model parameters 
A VPC plot for all the data in the dataset combined (Figure 10) shows that the data are well predicted 
by the model. The observed and predicted 95% PI are similar and generally within the 95% CI around 
the PI. Overall, the simulated concentrations appeared to be reasonably consistent with the observed 
concentrations, with no systematic bias.

Similar  to  the  ADC  model,  the  final  PK  model  for  MMAE  was  used  to  simulate  the  concentrations 
produced after a 1.8 mg/kg dose of BV every 21 days for 3 cycles with a capped dose of 180 mg for 
patients  weighing  more  than  100  kg.  The  results  showed  that  there  is  minor  accumulation  of  MMAE 
with this dosing regimen. 
These increases in brentuximab vedotin ADC exposure in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types (Figure 
6) did not translate to higher MMAE exposure (Figure 11).

Immunogenicity assessments  
Immunogenicity assessments (anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) and neutralising ATA) in Study 
C25001 were based on serum from blood samples collected before brentuximab vedotin dosing in the 
cycle of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 and at EOT, and neutralising ATA was assessed for ATA-positive 
samples only. Sixty of 66 patients (91%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm were evaluable for 
immunogenicity assessments (14/16 patients [88%] with pcALCL and 46/50 patients [92%] with MF).  
All 14 patients with pcALCL were ATA negative at Baseline, and 6 of the 14 patients developed ATA 
after the brentuximab vedotin administration. Forty-two of 50 patients (84%) with MF were ATA 
negative at Baseline, and 19 of the 42 patients developed ATA after brentuximab vedotin 
administration. Most of the patients who were ATA negative at Baseline continued to be ATA negative 
at all assessment time points during the study (8 of 14 evaluable patients with pcALCL and 23 of 46 
evaluable patients with MF). Three of the 4 patients with MF who were ATA positive at Baseline 
remained transiently positive during the study; 1 patient with MF who was ATA positive at Baseline 
was ATA negative at all post-baseline time points. The total ATA-positive rate in Study C25001 was 
42% (28/66 patients) among the safety population; however, 16 of the 28 patients who were ATA 
positive were transiently ATA positive, and 23 of the 28 ATA-positive patients had low titres. Also, 20 
of the 28 ATA-positive patients were neutralising ATA positive. 
Population PK results by ATA status 
The impact of ATA status on the PK of the brentuximab vedotin ADC was evaluated in the PopPK 
analysis. A VPC plot comparing the observed and predicted brentuximab vedotin ADC concentration 
versus time since last dose for the studies that formed the basis of the original approval (SG035-0001, 
SG035-0002, SG035-0003, and SG035-0004) and the newer studies (C25001 and C25007) by ATA 
status is shown below. Notably the older studies had a large proportion of missing values, and the new 
studies had only 2 missing values. VPC plots show that the model generally predicts the 4 possible ATA 
status categories to a reasonable extent.

and NADA- (0.031 L/h).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Brentuximab vedotin and MMAE PK in the (CTCL subgroups) MF and pcALCL patients in the pivotal 
Study C25001 do not appear to be markedly different from the PK that has been previously described. 
Further analysis of the brentuximab vedotin and MMAE PK data was conducted using PopPK modelling. 
Overall the PopPK models for brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE appear to characterize the data 
sufficiently. The results indicated that body size, baseline ALB concentrations, tumour type, and ATA 
positivity affect brentuximab vedotin PK, but to an extent that is limited in relation to the overall 
variability in PK.  
The final brentuximab vedotin PopPK model was used to simulate and derive summary statistics of 
brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE exposure by tumour type and ATA status. In the PopPK model, 
the patients with pcALCL from Study C25001 (N=16) showed a 35% higher brentuximab vedotin ADC 
concentrations than patients with other tumour types. This may be explained by the lower CD30-
related disease burden in the pcALCL population compared with the HL and ALCL populations. 
Considering the previously demonstrated relationship between circulating sCD30 concentration and 
overall tumour burden, lower levels of tumour burden in CTCL may therefore result in relatively higher 
brentuximab vedotin ADC levels circulating in blood compared with other tumour types like HL and 
ALCL. However, when viewed in relation to the overall variability in brentuximab vedotin ADC PK (%CV 
in steady-state AUC of 39%-45% in ATA-negative patients), the magnitude of the differences in 
steady-state brentuximab vedotin ADC exposure across tumour types appear relatively modest (e.g., 
35% estimated higher geometric mean AUC in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types in the overall 
population, and 16% higher AUC in patients with MF in C25001 compared with patients with HL in 
Study C25007). Further, these changes in brentuximab vedotin ADC in pcALCL patients did not 
translate to higher MMAE exposure. 
Although ATA status was a statistically significant covariate on brentuximab vedotin ADC CL, the effect 
of this covariate on steady-state AUC was smaller than the overall extent of interpatient variability in 
brentuximab vedotin ADC PK (9-12% lower geometric mean steady-state AUC in ATA-positive vs ATA-
negative patients with pcALCL). The other covariate effects in the model showed that brentuximab 
vedotin ADC CL and Vc increase with increasing body size, and brentuximab vedotin ADC CL decreases 
with increasing ALB concentration. The impact of these changes appears modest.  
Based upon population PK analyses (see section 5.2 of the SmPC) and the safety profile in elderly 
patients, which are consistent with that of adult patients, the dosing recommendations for patients 
aged 65 and older are the same as for adults (section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Patients  being  positive  for  neutralising  ATAs  showed  an  increased  clearance  of  brentuximab  vedotin. 
However,  the increased clearance  of brentuximab vedotin  in  patients positive for  neutralising ATAs is 
not associated with decreased efficacy compared to the general study population. 
The final MMAE model included the effect of creatinine concentration, BSA, bilirubin concentration, and 
ALB concentration on CL; and BSA on Vc. However, pcALCL tumour type was not found to be a 
statistically significant predictor of MMAE CL. Overall, MMAE AUC and Cmax in patients with CTCL in 
Study C25001 were similar to those in patients with relapsed/refractory HL in Study C25007. 
The  data  from  the  pop-PK  model  show  that  brentuximab  vedotin  clearance  appears  to  decrease  with 
age to a limited extent (Cycle 1 Cl at 20 years approximately 0.07 l/h vs 0.05 l/h at 70 years). In line 
with these CL data, the simulated AUC for brentuximab vedotin increased by approximately 20% going 
from 20 to 70 years. Simulated MMAE AUC was almost unchanged in this age range (data not shown). 
Both for brentuximab vedotin and MMAE, Cmax was unchanged within this age range. These changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 27/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are considered to be of no clinical relevance. Therefore, the dosing recommendations for patients aged 
65 and older in the SmPC, have been updated and are the same as for adults. 
Taken together, these analyses support the conclusion that there are no clinically meaningful 
differences in the systemic exposures of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in patients with CTCL 
compared with patients with other tumour types. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data provided confirm the known clinical pharmacology of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE. No 
marked difference in exposure was apparent between the CTCL patients as compared with HL and 
sALCL patients. There is little accumulation of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE exposure, and steady-
state AUC and Cmax predicted in patients with CTCL in Study C25001 were very similar to those from 
patients with HL in Study C25007. This is supported by the PopPK modelling and simulation exercise. 
Further PK data from Study C25001 into the PopPK dataset increased the number of elderly patients in 
this dataset. The analysis showed that age was not a covariate in the PopPK models. Hence, the 
posology in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated for patients aged 65 and older, which is 
considered the same as for adults. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No new dose response study was submitted. The recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in the 
approved indications of HL and sALCL was used in the current study (1.8 mg/kg as IV infusion over 30 
minutes Q3W).

/week) to achieve optimal clinical response/lowest effective dose were allowed according to protocol. 
Patients could receive methotrexate for a maximum of 48 weeks. 
Bexarotene once daily 300 mg/m2 orally, dose reduction was allowed to 200 mg/m2/day or 100 
mg/m2/day. Bexarotene could be temporarily suspended for toxicity. Pre-treatment with fenofibrate 
145 to 200 mg for 7 days (or reduced dose in case of creatinine≥1.5 mg/dL or nephrotic syndrome) 
was required. Concurrently a low dose of synthetic thyroxine (T4) was to be taken (adjusted along 
with dose of bexarotene). Continual monitoring of lipid and T4 concentrations was required during 
bexarotene treatment. Patients could receive bexarotene for a maximum of 48 weeks.

Objectives 
Primary objective: to determine objective response lasting at least 4 months (ORR4), with 
brentuximab vedotin in patients with CD30+ MF or pcALCL compared to that achieved with therapy in 
the control arm. 
Key secondary objectives: to determine CR rate, PFS and burden of symptoms with brentuximab 
vedotin compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm. 
Other secondary objectives: to determine duration of response (DOR) and duration of skin response in 
brentuximab vedotin. To determine event-free survival (EFS) with brentuximab vedotin compared to 
that achieved with therapy in the control arm. To describe PK of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in 
blood. To determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin. To assess patient-reported QOL 
outcomes. To assess the safety of brentuximab vedotin. 
Additional (exploratory) objectives: to investigate the relationship between baseline levels of CD30 
expression and clinical response. To assess changes in CD30 expression before and after treatment. To 
investigate possible correlations between expression of serum protein markers and response. To 
examine correlation between biomarkers related to the disease pathway, drug mechanism, and drug 
clearance proteins, such as CD30, tubulin, Fcneo, and Fcγ receptors and clinical response. To assess 
healthcare utilisation. To collect patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data for utility-based economic 
evaluations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: ORR4 is the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (CR or PR) 
that lasted at least 4 months, as determined by an independent review facility (IRF).  
Objective responses will be based on a Global Response Score (GRS), which consists of skin evaluation 
(mSWAT assessment) by investigator, nodal and visceral radiographic assessment by IRF, and 
detection of circulating Sézary cells (MF only) by IRF.  
  Skin evaluation (mSWAT) performed at screening, before dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, -3 and 
at the end of every cycle beginning at Cycle 3, EOT, and at post treatment follow-up visits  
  CT scans for patients without nodal or visceral involvement were performed at screening and 
during the cycle following the first skin response and 6 cycles (or ≥ 4 months) after that or in 
case of suspected new/progressive disease in the LN/viscera  
  CT scans for patients with baseline nodal/visceral disease, were performed at screening and at 
the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, and per the follow-up schedule until PD or suspected 
new/progressive disease in the LN/viscera and at EOT  
  Blood sample for Sézary cell enumeration in patients with MF performed at screening; at the 
end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, at EOT, and per the follow-up schedule until PD or study 
closure

Key secondary endpoints:  
  CR - proportion of patients who achieved a CR as their best response on study as determined by 
an IRF by GRS criteria 
 
PFS- time from randomisation until PD per IRF or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first  
  Changes in symptom domain (7 items) according to Skindex-29 questionnaire (administered on 
Day 1 of Cycles 1 and subsequent even number cycles) 
Other secondary endpoints: 
  DOR- analysed for patients in the ITT population with a confirmed response per IRF 
  DOR in skin- analysed for patients in the ITT population with skin response (CR or PR in skin) 
per investigator 
 
EFS- time from randomisation until any cause of treatment failure per IRF: PD, discontinuation 
of treatment for any reason, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
  Concentrations of brentuximab vedotin (serum) and MMAE (plasma) 
 
Immunogenicity assessment 
  QOL assessments according to Skindex-29 and FACT-G questionnaires 
  AEs and SAEs, according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 and assessments of clinical laboratory 
values 
Exploratory endpoints 
  Qualitative and quantitative measures of CD30 expression in biopsied tumour assessed before 
and after brentuximab vedotin treatment. The Quest clinical trial assay was initially used for 
screening to determine CD30 expression in tissue samples from skin biopsies. This assay was 
later replaced by the Ventana anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) assay (Amendment 3). 
  Serum concentration of PD markers such as sCD30 
 
Presence or absence of gene or protein variation associated with CTCL or brentuximab vedotin 
mechanism of action 
  Utilisation of health resources 
Patient-reported QOL assessment per EQ-5D-3L for economic considerations 
Sample size 
Approximately 124 patients, approximately 62 patients per treatment arm, were to be randomised to 1 
of the treatment arms in the study. The sample size was calculated to provide 90% power to detect a 
30% improvement in ORR4 in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group, assuming ORR4 for the 
methotrexate or bexarotene treatment group was 40%. This calculation was based on a 2-sided chi-
squared test with a significance level of alpha=0.05, and a 10% dropout rate using nQuery Advisor 
7.0. A minimum of 30 patients with pcALCL, 15 patients per treatment arm were to be randomised in 
the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 32/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
Patients will be randomised in an overall ratio of 1:1 to Arm 1 (brentuximab vedotin) or Arm 2 
(physician’s choice of MTX or bexarotene) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by 
baseline disease diagnosis (MF or pcALCL). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
No interim analyses were planned for efficacy. In general, missing data was treated as missing, and no 
data imputation were applied unless otherwise specified. 
The primary endpoint, ORR4 per IRF, will be analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test 
stratified by baseline disease diagnosis (pcALCL or MF) based on the ITT population. Difference in 
proportions were based on normal approximation. The objective response was considered maintained 
for patients with a previous CR who experienced recurrent disease (relapse) unless the criteria for 
disease progression were met. Patients who do not have any post baseline response assessment or no 
response before dropout, will be counted as non-responders. Patients whose first response occurs after 
the start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, but otherwise meet the primary endpoint criteria will be 
excluded. 
Pre-specified subgroups analyses were performed for the following subgroups: baseline disease 
diagnosis, ECOG PS, sex, age (<65, ≥65), region, race and physician’s choice. Baseline disease 
involvement and baseline skin tumour involvement were not pre-specified.  
The key secondary endpoints CR per IRF, PFS per IRF, symptom Skindex-29 were analysed 
using a fixed sequential testing procedure (weighted Holm procedure). The analyses for CR per IRF, 
PFS per IRF, and the changes in symptom domain of the Skindex-29 were assigned weights (0.7, 0.2, 
and 0.1, respectively). Comparison of the CR rates between the 2 treatment groups will be conducted 
using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and normal approximation for difference in 
proportions. Patients who do not have any post baseline response assessment as specified in the 
protocol will be counted as non-responders. 
Stratified log-rank test statistics will be used to compare PFS between the 2 treatment arms. The HRs 
and 95% CIs will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. The Kaplan-Meier method will 
be used to estimate the distribution of the time-to event endpoints for each treatment. An alpha level 
of 0.01 (2-sided) was specified per the weighted Holm procedure. 
Handling of missing data and censoring PFSs: The date of PD/response should be assigned based on 
the time of the first documentation regardless of violations or discontinuation of study drug. Patients 
who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or those who discontinue treatment due to undocumented 
PD were censored at the last disease assessment. If death or PD occurs after a missed visit, then the 
patient is treated as progressed at the date of death or PD. Patients without baseline and/or no 
sufficient post baseline data for disease assessment and with no death recorded will be censored at the 
date of randomisation. If PD is documented between scheduled visits, then the date of the documented 
PD is the date of progression. If the patient starts new antineoplastic therapy before PD, then the 
patient is treated as progressed at the date of assessment at which PD was documented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 33/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For skin symptoms (Skindex-29; symptom domain), the mean of symptom reduction between both 
arms is compared. ‘Symptom reduction’ is defined for each patient as the maximum reduction from 
baseline (sum of the 7 items related to skin symptoms normalised to a 1-100 scale) over the non-
missing visits. The ANCOVA model controlling for baseline covariates (treatment group, baseline score, 
disease diagnosis, ECOG) will be employed for the analysis. No validated MID methods were available 
at time of data analyses. The Applicant calculated the MID using three methods based on the current 
dataset: half of standard deviation of the maximum score change; Cohen’s moderate effect size (0.5x 
st.dev baseline score) and ‘standard error of measurement’ (std dev(baseline score)√(1-Cronbachs α). 
Regarding the other secondary endpoints, EFS will be analysed similarly as the endpoint PFS. DOR 
and duration of skin response will be summarised descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. PRO 
endpoints include subscales of Skindex-29 and global and subscale scores of the EQ-5D and FACT-G 
questionnaires. All PRO scores (Skindex 29 total score, EQ-5D and FACT-G score) will first be scaled 
into numeric scores following published or pre-specified scoring guidelines for each PRO instrument 
employed in this trial. Scores will be summarised in descriptive statistics for the 2 treatment groups 
over time. 
Handling of missing data and censoring secondary endpoints: The ITT principle will be used to 
determine the event time or censoring time for the EFS analysis. For EFS, patients who are lost to 
follow-up will be censored at last disease assessment. Patients who withdraw consent or start new 
antineoplastic therapy will be treated as if experiencing an EFS event. Patients without baseline and/or 
sufficient post baseline data for disease assessment and no treatment discontinuation or death 
recorded will be censored at the date of randomisation.  
DOR will be analysed for patients with confirmed response (CR or PR) in the ITT population. Patients 
who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or discontinue treatment due to undocumented PD after 
the last adequate disease assessment will be censored at the last disease assessment. If the patient 
starts new antineoplastic therapy before PD, the patient is treated as progressed at the date of 
assessment at which PD was documented. Duration of skin response will be analysed for patients with 
skin response (CR or PR in skin) in the ITT population). Data was handled similar to DOR. Patients 
without sufficient skin assessment data after the initial skin response and with no death recorded were 
censored at the date of the initial skin response. 
Sensitivity analyses  
 
For ORR4 per IRF per response criteria which are published by Whittaker (2010) in the ITT and 
MF patients only 
  ORR4 per IRF based on a subset of GRS time points, using the available CT scans and blood 
assessments for GRS at the time points they were taken. For patients with baseline 
nodal/visceral/blood disease, the sensitivity analysis used GRS assessed at time points with 
concurrent nodal/viscera/blood component assessments. For patients with skin-only disease, 
this analysis used the same GRS assessment frequency as the primary analysis. 
  ORR4 per investigator GRS 
  ORR per IRF and per investigator 
 
For the skin symptoms using the linear mixed model with repeated measures at each time 
point specified in the protocol SOE. The total score for skin symptoms (Skindex-29) will be 
imputed with the mean of the other items if there is no more than 1 missing item; otherwise, it 
will be considered invalid and excluded from the analysis.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled in the study on 13 August 2012. The last patient was enrolled in the 
study on 31 July 2015, and the last patient visit before the data cut-off was on 26 May 2016. Patients 
in this study were enrolled at 34 study centres. A total of 33 patients (25%) were enrolled in the 
United States, 68 patients (52%) in the European Union, 20 patients (15%) in Australia, 6 patients 
(5%) in Switzerland, and 4 patients (3%) in Brazil. 
Conduct of the study 
Study conduct was revised by 5 amendments to the original Protocol C25001. The major amendments 
are summarised below. Major protocol deviations were reported for 9 patients in the study. One 
protocol deviation related to the informed consent form, which was signed after randomisation and 2 
days after rescreening visit. Other major protocol deviations are shown in

Table 12.  
Amendment 1 (no patients enrolled) 
Primary endpoint changed from ORR to ORR4. The study population was modified to include only 
patients with a primary diagnosis of MF or pcALCL(minimum 30 patients). Only patients who received 
at least 1 prior systemic therapy were allowed in to the trial. The confirmation of tumour CD30 
positivity decreased from 75% to 10% based on phase II data.  
Amendment 2 (46 patients enrolled) 
Due to the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity use of bleomycin with brentuximab vedotin was 
contraindicated. For patients who completed either 48 weeks of study treatment discontinuation of 
therapy was to be attempted. After 48 weeks either subsequent standard of care (control arm) or re-
initiation of brentuximab vedotin (interventional arm) was permitted.  
Amendment 3 (no patients enrolled) 
Patients with SD were allowed to continue to receive study treatment up to 16 cycles of brentuximab 
vedotin or 48 weeks with the control therapy. Patients with pcALCL were allowed to have received prior 
radiation therapy or at least 1 prior systemic therapy instead of the latter. The CD30 (screening) assay 
was changed from the Quest CTA to the Ventana anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) assay. Tumour samples from 
patients enrolled using the Quest assay were re-evaluated using the Ventana assay. 
Protocol Amendment 5 (6 patients enrolled) 
Amendment 5 included updated safety information and revised the existing eligibility criteria regarding 
patients at risk for pancreatitis, due to experiences in clinical studies and post marketing.

The majority of patients with pcALCL had skin only lesions with 9 (56%) patients treated with 
brentuximab vedotin and 11 (73%) with physician’s choice of therapy, while 7 (44%) and 4 patients 
(27%) had extracutaneous disease, respectively. 
Prior cancer-related therapies 
In  
Table 14 the prior cancer related therapies are summarised. One patient with pcALCL who was 
randomised to the brentuximab vedotin arm did not receive prior radiation therapy or at least 1 prior 
systemic therapy and is included in major protocol deviations. In MF patients a median of 2 prior 
systemic therapies was observed in both arms and in pcALCL subjects a median of 1 in the 
brentuximab vedotin and 2 in the control arm were observed. All but 1 pcALCL patient (see above) 
received prior systemic therapy in this study. The median time since progression from last line of prior 
therapy (radiotherapy excluded) was 2.4 months (range 0-112) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 
1.4 months (range 0-55) in the control arm. 
In the physician’s choice arm, 3 patients (8%) had previously received bexarotene for their CTCL and 
were assigned by their physician to bexarotene in this study. Similarly, 2 patients (8%) in the 
physician’s choice arm had previously received methotrexate and received methotrexate as study 
drug. The listing of individual patient data indicate that for the 2 methotrexate retreated patients the 
best response on previous methotrexate was SD and PR. Both patients had also previously received 
bexarotene. For the bexarotene retreated patients the previous responses to bexarotene were 
documented as unknown. Only one of the bexarotene retreated patients was previously treated with 
methotrexate.

Four patients (3 (5%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 (2%) in the physician’s choice arm) had 
prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant.

The most common prior skin directed therapies in the ITT population were radiotherapy (64%), 
phototherapy (48%) and topical steroids (17%). The most common prior systemic therapies in the ITT 
population were chemotherapy (71%), immunotherapy (43%) and bexarotene (38%).

Concomitant medication and procedures 
Nearly all patients received concomitant medication during the study, however concomitant 
medications which might have influenced outcomes were prohibited per protocol. The most common 
concomitant medication received by patients who received methotrexate (n=25) was folic acid in 13 
patients (52%). In patients who received bexarotene (n=37), 27 patients (73%) received concomitant 
treatment with fenofibrate, and 33 patients (89%) received treatment with levothyroxine. In the 
brentuximab vedotin arm, 13 patients (20%) received levothyroxine, 12 patients (18%) received 
hydroxyzine, and 9 patients (14%) received fenofibrate other than the required premedication course. 
Statins were administered to 21 patients (32%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm.

Key secondary endpoints 
CR 
Per IRF assessment, study treatment led to CR in 10 patients (15.6%) (95%CI 6.7-24.5) in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 patient (1.6%) (95%CI 0-4.6) in the physician’s choice arm (p-
value=0.0046; adjusted p-value=0.0046; percentage difference of 14.1 (95% CI (-4.0, 31.5)). 
PFS 
The PFS analyses were performed with an median PFS follow-up of 17.5 months. At the time of data 
cut-off, 86 (67%) patients had experienced a PFS event: progressive disease per IRF in 74 patients 
(30 patients (47%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 44 patients (69%) in the physician’s choice 
arm and death in 12 patients (6 patients (9%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 6 patients (9%) in 
the physician’s choice arm.

Changes in symptom domain of Skindex-29 Score 
The changes in symptoms are measured by the mean maximum change from baseline in disease 
symptoms, as measured by the Skindex-29 symptom domain score. The mean maximum change from 
baseline was -28 points (std dev- 26.9) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and -8.62 points (std dev 
17.0) in the physician’s choice arm (p-value<0.001; adjusted p-value<0.001). The median of the 
maximum reduction from baseline was -32.1 points (range, -78.6 to 42.9 points) in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and -10.42 points (range, -50.0 to 28.6 points) in the physician’s choice arm. The

calculated MID in the reduction in Skindex-29 symptom domain score was 12.3 using half of a 
standard deviation of change in score, 11.2 using Cohen’s effect size, and 9.1 using standard error of 
measurement.

Other secondary endpoints 
Duration of response 
In patients who received brentuximab vedotin and experienced CR or PR (43 patients), the median 
DOR was 15.1 months (CI 9.7, 25.5). In patients who received either methotrexate or bexarotene and 
experienced CR or PR (13 patients), the median DOR was 18.3 months (CI 3.5, 18.4). Responses were 
ongoing at last assesment in 20 of the 43 responders (47%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 7 of 
the 13 patients (54%) in the physician’s choice arm. 
Duration of skin response 
In patients who received brentuximab vedotin and experienced skin response (47 patients), the 
median duration of skin response was 20.6 months (14.1, 25.7). In patients who received either 
methotrexate or bexarotene and experienced skin response (19 patients), the median duration of skin 
response was 18.3 months (3.5, 18.9). Responses were ongoing at last assessment in 25 of the 47 
responders (53%) in the in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 9 of the 19 patients (47%) in the 
physician’s choice arm.

  ORR4 per investigator GRS in the ITT: a total of 38 patients (59.4%) in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 5 patients (7.8%) in the physician’s choice arm 
(p-value <0.001). 
  ORR4 in which the patient’s response after the start of next alternate therapy was censored at 
the start of next alternate therapy: a total of 35 patients (54.7%) in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm achieved ORR4, compared with 7 patients (10.9%) in the physician’s choice arm (p-value 
<0.001). 
  ORR4  in  CR  patients  with  recurrent  disease  considered  as  not  maintained  (i.e.,  relapse  is 
treated as PD): a total of 36 patients (56.3%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, 
compared with 8 patients (12.9%) in the physician’s choice arm (p-value <0.001).

The linear mixed model with repeated measures and imputed scores were in line with the 
original analyses; though scores in the control arm were lower than in the original analysis. 
Exploratory analyses 
ORR4 
  ORR4 per IRF based on GRS consisting of skin evaluation mSWAT assessment by independent 
review of photographs for skin response: a total of 22 patients (34% (CI 22.7-46.0)) in the 
brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4 compared with 6 patients (9.4% (CI 2.2-16.5)) in the 
physician’s choice arm (p-value <0.001). 
Time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy 
 
The time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy was assessed in the ITT population with 38 
patients (59%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 47 patients (73%) in the physician’s 
choice arm who received at least 1 subsequent antineoplastic therapy. The median time to 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy was 14.3 (12.5, 20.4) months in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm and 5.5 (3.6, 7.2) months in the physician’s choice arm with HR=0.236 (95% CI 0.145, 
0.383) (p<0.001).

Soluble CD30 expression, TARC, CTACK 
Soluble CD30 (sCD30), Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC), Cutaneous T-cell-
Attracting Chemokine (CTACK) were measured in serum in both treatment arms at Baseline, before 
administration of study drug on Day 1 of Cycle 2 through Cycle 16, and at EOT. Levels of sCD30, TARC 
and CTACK were highly variable between patients. Mean baseline values of these three biomarkers 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017

were similar at baseline. Mean sCD30 levels slightly increased throughout time in the interventional 
arm and did not change in the control arm. Mean levels of TARC declined over the course of treatment, 
moreso in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared to the control arm. CTACK mean levels declined in 
the brentuximab vedotin arm over time and increased in the physician’s choice arm over time. 
Immunogenicity/ATA Status 
Sixty patients (91%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm were evaluable for immunogenicity assessments. 
From the total analysed population 56 (85%) were ATA negative at baseline. The total ATA positive 
rate in the study was 42% among the Safety population, of which 24% were ATA transiently positive 
and 18% persistently positive. There were no apparent differences in ORR4 per IRF by ATA response 
or titre status. In total 30% of the patients neutralising ATA was measured. No correlation between 
neutralising ATA status and efficacy were provided. 
Health Economics Using Medical Resource Utilisation 
The number of patients with at least one hospitalisation was 19 (30%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
and 28 (44%) in the control arm. The number of patients with at least one outpatient visits were 38 
(59%) and 30 (47%) respectively. The median number of hospitalised days was 15 vs 20 days, 
respectively and the number of median number of outpatient visits was 5 days in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 13 in the control arm. 
In both arms the number of patients with hospitalisation due to AEs was equal (45%). The median 
number of missed days from work was 9 days in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 5 days in the 
control arm.

Notes 
* Adjusted p-value 
DOR, DOR skin, and EFS are not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No analysis performed across trials for efficacy was submitted. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Patients up to 83 years were included in the pivotal study. Subgroup analyses were performed for 
ORR4 and PFS between patients ≥65 years (28 (44%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 24 (38%) 
control arm) and patients <65 years. In patients ≥65 years decreased efficacy was observed compared 
to patients <65 years. The ORR4 subgroup analyses indicated a 32.1% difference in patients ≥65 
compared to control arm vs 51% difference in younger patients. For PFS, HR: 0.54, in which the CI 
crosses 1 in older patients and HR: 0.11 in younger patients. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Published literature studies in CTCL subtypes were included in this submission. This included two phase 
2 trials in which brentuximab vedotin was given at 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 1 retrospective study 
and several case studies.  
The phase II trial by Kim et al (2015) included 30 patients of which 3 with Sézary Syndome (SS) and 
27 with MF. Patients were allowed to receive up to 16 cycles. In the 3 SS patients different outcomes 
(1CR, 1PR, 1PD) were observed. The phase II trial by Duvic et al (2016) in MF and LPD (n=48) 
included 17 patients with Lyp (n=9) or mixed Lyp histology; these patients had a RR of 100% including 
13CRs. Median duration of response was 26 weeks (range 6 to 44). 
In a retrospective single centre study (Wieser 2016) in patients with Lyp and Lyp mixed histology, 
brentuximab vedotin was given in 21 patients (posology is not known). Patients’ LyP lesions regressed 
with 1 to 2 infusions. A total of 10 patients (47.6%) achieved a CR and 7 (33%) patients had relapse 
after therapy was stopped.  
Several case reports which apply different posology are included. For SS patients (2 PD, 1SD and 1 
response) and for patients with pc ɣδ T-cell lymphoma (1CR, 2PR, 2SD) responses were observed. 
In addition to the data collected in Study C25001, 2 investigator-sponsored trials (ISTs) were provided 
(Study 35-IST-001 and Study 35-IST-002). The main efficacy data is summarised below.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH submitted one pivotal trial (CA25001/ ALCANZA) which was an open label, randomised (1:1) 
phase  III  study  to  support  the  extension  of  the  indication.  The  study  included  patients  with  CD30+ 
(≥10%) MF or pcALCL. During scientific advice (SA; Febr.2011), the MAH was recommended to include 
a  sufficient  number  of  CTCL  types,  as  it  was  not  regarded  justified  to  pool  efficacy  results  in  a 
heterogeneous disorder. In principle, it could be possible to extrapolate to subtypes which might have 
similar prognosis as the studied subtypes as some of the subtypes are very rare and clinical trials are 
not feasible. 
Patients were enrolled in the study after they  had  received at least 1 systemic therapy for MF and 1 
prior  systemic  therapy  or  prior  radiation  for  pcALCL.  The  choice  of  the  control  arm  (bexarotene  and 
methotrexate)  is  acceptable.  Bexarotene  is  an  approved  second  line  therapy  for  CTCL  and 
methotrexate is a frequently used therapy  for MF and  a recommended therapy for pcALCL.  However, 
these  two  treatments  have  different  efficacy  (ORR4:  15.8%  and  7.7%,  median  PFS,  4.5  and  2.3 
months, respectively). Given that the majority of control patients were treated with bexarotene, which 
has better efficacy than methotrexate, the pooling of patients treated with bexarotene or methotrexate 
is not expected to change the outcome of the results.  
A  large  part  (45%)  of  the  screened  patients  were  not  enrolled  in  the  study.  From  the  106  patients 
(45%)  who  failed  screening,  65  patients  (61%)  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  CD30+  eligibility.  The 
study  included  small  patient  numbers,  especially  for  those  with  pcALCL.  This  is  regarded  acceptable, 
since both are very rare diseases. Demographic data and baseline clinical data are balanced between 
the  two  arms  with  the  exception  of  more  severe  pcALCL  and  more  time  since  initial  diagnosis  in  the 
brentuximab vedotin arm compared to the treatment arm. However, most likely these differences will 
not have a large influence on the outcomes, or at most predispose for slight less favourable outcomes 
in the interventional arm.

Most  MF  patients  did  not  have  advanced  staged  disease  (≥stage  2)  and  most  pcALCL  patients  had 
stage  3  disease  (generalised  skin  involvement)  at  study  entry.  In  both  arms  MF  patients  received  a 
median  of  two  systemic  therapies  and  all  pcALCL  patients  (except  1  protocol  violation)  received  at 
least one systemic therapy.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  ORR4  per  IRF,  measured  by  the  global  response  score  (GRS)  as 
recommended  by  EORTC/ISCL,  is  regarded  as  acceptable.  ORR4  along  with  the  secondary  endpoint 
PFS,  provides  a  more  robust  readout  than  only  ORR  in  this  disease.  PFS  is  considered  an  acceptable 
endpoint, especially since this disease is characterised by frequent recurrences and an indolent course 
in  early  stages.  The  MAH  followed  the  SA  (Febr.  2011),  where  the  mSWAT  was  performed  by  the 
investigator and sensitivity analyses  were  performed  for ORR4 with mSWAT  on photographs per IRF. 
This strategy is considered acceptable as a clinical assessment of the skin is preferred.  
In  terms  of  measuring  response,  patients  who  started  new  therapy  for  ORR4  and  had  an  ongoing 
response  at  the  time  of  the  start  of  next  alternate  therapy  were  counted  as  responders.  For  ORR4 
patients with a previous CR who experienced recurrent disease responses were considered maintained 
unless  the  criteria  for  disease  progression  were  met.  Results  from  sensitivity  analyses  in  which  the 
patient’s response after the start of next alternate therapy was censored at the start of next alternate 
therapy were similar to the primary analyses. Key secondary endpoints (CR, PFS, skin symptoms) are 
analysed  only  after  statistical  significance  of  the  primary  endpoint  ORR4  (fixed  sequential  testing 
procedure)  and  controlled  for  type  I  error  (weighted  Holm  procedure).  The  analyses  are  considered 
acceptable.  Most  subgroups  were  pre-specified  in  the  SAP  and  no  interim  analysis  for  efficacy  was 
planned,  which  is  regarded  as  appropriate.  The  protocol  was  amended  5  times.  None  of  the 
amendments  are  considered  critical  for  conduct  of  the  study  or  the  interpretation  of  data.  Protocol 
deviations were equally balanced between treatment arms. 
Patients with CTCL should receive up to 16 cycles (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  difference  in  primary  endpoint  ORR4  favouring 
brentuximab  vedotin  over  physicians’  choice  therapy  was  observed  where  ORR4  was  56.3%  for  the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  compared  with  12.5%  for  the  control  arm.  This  statistical  significant 
difference  was  consistent  over  MF/pcALCL  patients  and  over  physician’s  choice  treatment.  ORR4  was 
generally consistent over the subgroups, though not significant in 2 subgroups (ECOG ≥1 and baseline 
skin  tumour  =0),  which  might  relate  to the  small  patient  numbers.  Sensitivity  analyses  show  similar 
outcomes.  In  an  exploratory  analysis  for  ORR4  (per  IRF  including  mSWAT  by  skin  photographs  per 
IRF)  the  difference  still  favoured  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  over  the  control  arm,  however,  a 
marked  lower  number  of  responses  are  assigned  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm,  though  still 
favouring brentuximab vedotin. This is considered acceptable  as the  difficulties in  assessment  of skin 
response per mSWAT by photographs are acknowledged, as are the associated difficulties to objectify 
the outcomes per IRF. 
The CR rate was regarded as supportive of the primary endpoint with a higher CR in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm over the control arm. The PFS analyses showed a statistically significant PFS difference of 
13 months for brentuximab vedotin over the physician’s choice arm, which is regarded as compelling 
and  clinically  relevant.  These  data  can  be  regarded  as  mature  and  were  conducted  after  67%  of  the 
patients  experienced  a  PFS  event,  which  resulted  in  a  median  follow  up  of  17.5  months.  Sensitivity 
analyses with different handling of missing data and censoring rules were consistent with the original 
analyses.  The  PFS  advantage  of  brentuximab  vedotin  over  the  control  arms  is  generally  consistent 
across the other subgroups.

MF  and  pcALCL  have  different  prognoses,  however  subgroup  analyses  indicate  statistically  significant 
outcomes in both ORR4 and PFS and thus it can be concluded that efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in 
both  types  of  CTCL  compared  to  the  physician’s  choice  treatment  can  be  demonstrated.  In  two 
subgroups, the PFS effect is not statistically significant (ECOG ≥1 and age ≥65), most likely related to 
the small sample sizes of the subgroups. 
The disease symptoms, measured as the mean of the (per subject) maximum reduction from baseline 
in  the  Skindex-29  symptom  domain  was  higher  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  compared  to  the 
control  arm.  However,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  disease  symptoms  as  the  trial  was  open  label 
and  from  cycle  6  onwards  only  a  part  of  the  total  population  was  analysed.  Regarding  QoL,  no 
meaningful differences were observed between both treatment arms in the Skindex domains emotions 
and  functioning  and  skin  symptoms.  The  FACT-G  and  EQ-5D-3L  outcomes  were  similar  between  the 
two treatment arms. Due to the open label design and the small sample size, no firm conclusions can 
be  drawn  (SmPC  section  5.1).  Other  secondary  endpoints  were  supportive  of  the  primary  endpoints 
but since they were not adjusted for multiplicity, the results should be interpreted with caution.  
OS  curves  were  provided  to  exclude  any  detrimental  effects  from  the  treatment.  In  the  pcALCL 
patients,  there  appears  to  be  a  trend  towards  a  better  survival  for  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm 
compared  to  the  control  arm  and  in  MF  patients,  the  curves  mostly  favour  brentuximab  vedotin  but 
appear  to  cross  around  17  months.  A  further  updated  data  cut  for  OS  did  not  allow  to  attribute  the 
observation of better OS in the control arm to switching of control patients to brentuximab vedotin. As 
such,  no  definitive  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the  longer-term  survival  of  MF  patients.  Since  the 
study  was  not  powered  to  detect  OS  differences,  the  uncertainties  relating  to  the  OS  data  of  MF 
patients are not considered to affect the totality of the favourable efficacy data in MF. 
The  proposed  indication  for  “adults  with  CD30+  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  who  require 
systemic  therapy”  is  broader  than  the  studied  population.  CD30  is  expressed  in  high  (per  definition) 
and homogeneous levels by CD30+ LPDs (pcALCL and Lyp) and CD30 may also be expressed by other 
CTCL  types  (Sézary  Syndome  (SS)  and  the  more  rare  CTCL  NOS  and  primary  cutaneous  ɣδ  T  cell 
lymphoma). The MAH provided more detailed data (full CSR) from the two investigator sponsored trails 
(ISTs) in which different CTCL subtypes (SS, Lyp and mixed histologies together with MF and pcALCL± 
85%  of  CTCL,)  were  included.  Disease  activity  was  shown  across  all  these  subtypes.  In  the  Lyp 
subtype had comparable efficacy to the MF and pcALCL patients. The ISTs SS and mixed CTCL efficacy 
outcomes  were  somewhat  lower  compared  to  the  MF/pcALCL  patients.  Prognoses  in  CTCL  mixed 
histology is not known, however the  subtype SS  is generally  associated with worse  prognoses, which 
could  explain  these  numbers.  The  available  data  appears  in  support  for  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy 
from MF and pcALCL to other subtypes (SmPC section 5.1). 
Patients enrolled were only allowed in the study after they had received at least 1 systemic therapy for 
MF  and  1  prior  systemic  therapy  or  prior  radiation  for  pcALCL.  There  were  no  data  submitted 
comparing  brentuximab  vedotin  with  current  systemic  treatments  used  in  the  first  line  setting  (e.g. 
mono  or  combination  therapy  of  ECP,  total  skin  EBT,  PUVA,  interferon,  retinoids).  In  addition,  it  is 
unknown  whether  there  are  possible  differences  between  the  first  and  second  line+  populations,  in 
relation to disease stage, CD30 expression, disease transformation, that could affect treatment efficacy 
in  first  line.  Given  these  uncertainties,  extrapolation  of  benefit/risk  from  the  second  to  the  first  line 
setting was not considered acceptable.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study C25001 was a randomised trial with CD30+ MF and pcALCL patients, who had received at least 
1 prior systemic therapy. A statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in ORR4, favouring 
the brentuximab vedotin arm over the physician’s choice arm was observed. PFS and subgroup 
analyses also supported the efficacy data observed with brentuximab vedotin arm over the control 
arm. Furthermore, anti-tumour activity was also shown in several other CTCL subtypes in two phase 2 
studies, providing enough evidence to extrapolate the indication to patients with CD30+ CTCL. 
Conversely, there was insufficient evidence to be able to extrapolate from second line to a first line 
indication. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The existing  safety profile of  brentuximab  vedotin monotherapy  was mainly  based on two single arm 
phase  II studies in 160 patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL, and one placebo 
controlled  Phase  III  trial  (AETHERA)  in  165  HL  patients  at  increased  risk  for  relapse  after  ASCT.  The 
median  number  of  cycles  with  similar  brentuximab  vedotin  dose  was  9  in  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory  HL,  15  in  HL  patients  at  increased  risk  of  relapse,  and  7  in  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory  sALCL.  Treatment-related  adverse  events  were  common, 
leading 
to 
treatment 
discontinuation  in  19-32%  of  patients  and  dose  modifications  in  46-54%  of  patients.  The  most 
common brentuximab vedotin treatment-related AEs in the pivotal studies were peripheral neuropathy, 
myelosuppression,  nausea,  infections  and  infusion  reactions.  The  majority  of  AEs  were  managed  by 
dose delays or reduction.  
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  brentuximab  vedotin  in  patients  with  CTCL  was  analysed  in  one  pivotal 
randomised Phase 3 trial, the ALCANZA trial. The safety  analysis set comprised 128 patients with the 
CTCL subtypes pcALCL or MF, who received ≥1 dose of any study drug. A total of 66 patients received 
brentuximab  vedotin,  and  in  the  control  arm  62  patients  received  physician’s  choice  of  either 
methotrexate or bexarotene.  
With  methotrexate  treatment,  there  is  a  potential  for  serious  toxic  reactions,  such  as  bone  marrow, 
liver, lung, and kidney toxicities. Bexarotene is a retinoid that has been associated with birth defects in 
humans  and  can  cause  major  lipid,  liver  function,  and  thyroid  test  abnormalities,  leukopenia,  and 
anaemia. 
Patient exposure 
Brentuximab  vedotin  1.8  mg/kg  was  administered  via  IV  infusion  over  approximately  30  minutes  on 
Day 1 of each 21 day cycle.  
Methotrexate  was  administered  once  weekly  as  a  single  oral  dose  of  5  to  50  mg  once  weekly.  The 
initial recommended starting dose of bexarotene was 150 mg/m2 for 14 days, with close monitoring of 
thyroxine and lipid levels. The dose would then be titrated to a final total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 if 
TEAEs were manageable at the lower dose. 
Because brentuximab vedotin was administered in 21-day cycles while bexarotene was dosed daily and 
methotrexate was dosed weekly, for purposes of comparison, 21 days of bexarotene or methotrexate

dosing was counted as 1 treatment cycle in the safety analyses. Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg 
of brentuximab vedotin intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles or physician’s 
choice  for  up  to  48  weeks.  The  median  number  of  cycles  was  approximately  12  cycles  in  the 
brentuximab vedotin arm. In the physician’s choice arm, the median duration of treatment (number of 
cycles)  for  patients  receiving  bexarotene  was  approximately  16  weeks  (5.5  cycles)  and  11  weeks  (3 
cycles) for patients receiving methotrexate. 
The maximum number of cycles (16) was received by 36% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
and 8% in the physician’s choice arm.

Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using MedDRA. 
AEs were reported up through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  
In  the  safety  analysis  set,  at  least  1  AE  of  any  Grade  was  reported  in  95%  of  patients  in  the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  90%  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm.  SAEs  of  any  causality  and  drug-
related treatment emergent adverse events (related TEAEs) ≥Grade 3 were each reported for 29% of 
patients in both treatment arms.  
A  higher  percentage of  patients in  the brentuximab  vedotin  arm  experienced a  TEAE  that  resulted  in 
study drug discontinuation compared with the physician’s choice arm (24% vs 8%, respectively).

Table 31:  Overview of TEAEs in ALCANZA and Pivotal Phase 2 and 3 Studies 
An additional safety analysis evaluated the incidence of TEAEs adjusted for study drug exposure, since 
patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  remained  longer  on  study  drug  than  patients  in  the 
physician’s choice arm. When adjusted for total person-year exposure, the incidence density of TEAEs 
in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  was  numerically  lower  compared  with  the  physician’s  choice  arm 
(13.15 vs 14.90 TEAEs per person-year, Table 32).

The treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in ≥10% of patients in either treatment arm 
of ALCANZA are presented in Table 33. Among patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm of ALCANZA, 
the most frequently reported TEAEs included peripheral sensory neuropathy (45% vs. 2% physician’s 
choice),  nausea  (36%  vs.  13%),  diarrhoea  (29%  vs.  6%),  fatigue  (29%  vs.  27%),  and  pruritus,

pyrexia,  and  vomiting  (17%  each  in  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  vs.  13%-18%-5%  respectively,  with 
physician’s choice).  
Among  patients in  the  physician’s  choice  arm  of  ALCANZA,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were 
fatigue (27%), pyrexia and hypertriglyceridemia (18% each), and nausea and pruritus (13% each).

Overall,  79%  of  patients  experienced  ≥1  treatment-related  TEAE,  including  86%  in  the  brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 71% in the physician’s choice arm. The most common treatment-related TEAEs in the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  included  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (44%  vs.0%  with  physician’s 
choice), nausea (32% vs.8%), and fatigue (27 vs. 23%).  
The  most  common  treatment-related  TEAEs  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm  included  fatigue  (23%), 
hypertriglyceridemia (18%), and headache (10%).

Regardless of causality, 29% of patients in both treatment arms experienced ≥1 SAE (Table 37). SAEs 
reported for more than 1 patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm were cellulitis and pyrexia (2 patients 
each). SAEs reported for more than 1 patient in the physician’s choice arm were pyrexia (4 patients) 
and sepsis (3 patients).

In  the  pooled  dataset  of  Adcetris  as  monotherapy  across  HL,  sALCL  and  CTCL  studies  (SG035-0003, 
SG035-0004,  SGN35-005,  SGN35-006,  C25001  and  C25007,  see  section  5.1)  the  most  frequent 
adverse reactions (≥10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, 
pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  neutropenia,  rash,  cough,  vomiting,  arthralgia,  peripheral 
motor  neuropathy,  infusion-related  reactions,  pruritus,  constipation,  dyspnoea,  weight  decreased, 
myalgia and abdominal pain. 
Serious adverse drug reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The frequency of unique serious adverse 
drug reactions was ≤1%. 
Treatment related SAEs 
Nine patients (14%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 3 patients (5%) in the physician’s choice arm 
experienced a combined total of 20 SAEs that were assessed as related to study drug (Table 38). None 
of the events occurred in >1 patient in either treatment arm.  
At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  for  the  study,  16  events  had  resolved,  and  two  remained  ongoing 
(Grade  3  PN  [brentuximab  vedotin  arm;  resulted  in  treatment  discontinuation]  and  Grade  1  skin

brentuximab vedotin arm who subsequently died of multiorgan failure. 
Among  the  9  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  who  had  treatment-related  SAEs,  three 
experienced Grade 3 SAEs in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis,  and impetigo 
(1  patient  each).  All  events  resolved  or  resolved  with  sequelae.  The  impetigo  SAE  resulted  in 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  One  other  drug-related  SAE  resulted  in  permanent 
discontinuation of brentuximab vedotin: Grade 4 drug eruption, reported in 1 patient. 
In the physician’s choice arm (methotrexate), 1 patient experienced a treatment-related SAE (Grade 4 
sepsis)  in  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC;  the  event  resolved  and  did  not  result  in  study 
discontinuation.  One  drug-related  SAE  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  of  physician’s  choice 
(bexarotene): Grade 3 haematuria, reported in 1 patient.

Deaths 
As  of  the  cut-off  date  for  the  ALCANZA  data  analyses,  which  included  the  PFS  follow-up  period,  the 
total number of deaths was 16 (24%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 14 (23%) in the physician’s 
choice arm (Table 39).  
Most  of  the  deaths  were  attributed  to  the  patients’  underlying  disease  (75%  of  the  deaths  in  the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  71%  of  the  deaths  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm)  and  were  not 
considered related to study treatment. 
Four deaths occurred within 30 days after the last study drug dose and all in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm.  Events  in  3  of  the  4  patients  were  attributed  by  the  investigator  to  the  patients’  underlying 
disease  (sepsis,  lymphoma  and  pulmonary  embolism).  In  the  fourth  patient,  a  fatal  event  of  multi-
organ failure at cycle 1 day 29 was considered by the investigator as being related both to underlying 
disease  and  to  a  therapeutic  effect  of  brentuximab  vedotin  on  sites  of  visceral  disease  (including 
intestinal  perforation  and  pancreatitis).  This  patient  had  not  met  study  eligibility  criteria  at  baseline 
(elevated  liver  function  test  results),  and  enrolment  of  this  patient  constituted  a  major  protocol 
violation. 
Seven  deaths  occurred  31  to  120  days  after  the  last  dose  of  the  study  drug,  and  all  occurred  in  the 
physician’s choice arm.

Summary of Deaths (ALCANZA Safety Population) 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of interest were selected based on the known safety profile of brentuximab vedotin. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
At  least  1  peripheral  neuropathy  (PN)  TEAE  was  reported  for  67%  of  patients  (n=44)  in  the 
brentuximab vedotin arm and 6% (n=4) in the physician’s choice arm (Table 40). PN SMQ TEAEs were 
considered  treatment  related  for  41  of  the  44  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  of  ALCANZA 
who  reported  PN  events  and  for  none  of  the  patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm.  The  most 
commonly reported PN SMQ term for the brentuximab vedotin arm was peripheral sensory neuropathy 
in 30 patients (45%); in the physician’s choice arm, 1 patient (2%) each reported muscular weakness, 
neuralgia, paraesthesia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 78/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the patients with a PN TEAE in the brentuximab vedotin arm, most were Grade 1 or 2 (n=17 and 21 
respectively), and for 6 patients (9%), a Grade 3 PN TEAE was reported. In the physician’s choice arm 
all PN events were Grade 1 or 2. No Grade 4 events were reported for either arm. 
The median time to first onset of any PN event was 12 weeks (range, 0-48 weeks) in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 2.5 weeks (range, 0-10 weeks) in the physician’s choice arm. 
Dose  delays  were  reported  for  16  of  the  44  patients  (36%)  who  experienced  an  event  of  PN  in  the 
brentuximab vedotin arm and none in the physician’s choice arm. 
With  a  median  overall  study  follow-up  of  22.9  months,  PN  SMQ  events  that  had  been  ongoing  had 
either  improved  or  completely  resolved  in  36  of  the  44  affected  patients  (82%)  in  the  brentuximab 
vedotin arm and in 1 of the 4 affected patients (25%) in the physician’s choice arm. 
Complete  resolution  was  reported  for  22  of  the  44  brentuximab  vedotin  patients  (50%)  and 
improvement was reported for 14 patients (32%). The maximum severity of those PN SMQ events that 
were ongoing at the last follow-up was reported as Grade 1 in 17 patients and Grade 2 in 5 patients; 
there were no ongoing Grade 3 events. The patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who discontinued 
because  of  PN  (n=9  patients)  were  able  to  complete  a  median  of  11  treatment  cycles  (range,  4-15 
cycles) of the possible 16 treatment cycles before discontinuation. 
Four  patients  (6%)  treated  with  brentuximab  vedotin  experienced  treatment-emergent  peripheral 
motor  neuropathy;  2  patients  had  events  with  a  maximum  severity  of  Grade  2,  and  2  patients  had 
events with a maximum severity of Grade 3. Onset of peripheral motor neuropathy ranged from 8 to 
24 weeks. One Grade 3 event was resolved by the EOT visit, and 2 events (1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 2) 
were  resolved  at  the  last  follow-up  visit.  One  patient  had  an  event  of  Grade  2  peripheral  motor 
neuropathy that was reported as not resolved or improved at the time of the last follow-up, 10 weeks 
after EOT.

Haematologic toxicities 
Preferred terms in the MedDRA blood and lymphatic system disorders system organ class (SOC) were 
reported in 15% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 19% the physician’s choice arm.  
In the brentuximab vedotin arm, 3% of patients experienced a Grade 3 TEAE and 5% experienced a 
Grade  4  TEAE.  The  most  common  Grade  3  or  4  events  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  were 
neutropenia  (Grade  3  in  2  patients  [3%],  Grade  4  in  1  patient  [2%]).  Grade  3  thrombocytopenia, 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and Grade 4 haemolytic uremic syndrome were each reported in 1 patient 
(2%) in this arm.  
A total of 10% of patients in the physician’s choice arm experienced Grade 3 TEAEs in this  SOC, with 
no patient experiencing a ≥Grade 4 TEAE. Grade 3 TEAEs in the physician’s choice arm were anaemia

in  3  patients  (5%)  and  neutropenia  in  3  patients  (5%).  Nearly  all  of  the  events  in  the  physician’s 
choice arm (10 of 12 patients) were reported in patients with bexarotene. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia or decreased neutrophil count TEAEs were reported for 9% of patients in the brentuximab 
vedotin arm and 6% of patients in the physician’s choice arm. 
Grade  3  neutropenia  events  were  reported  in  3  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  in  2 
patients  in  the  physician’s  choice  (bexarotene)  arm.  One  patient  (brentuximab  vedotin  arm) 
experienced ≥1 Grade 4 event. Among the patients with Grade 3-4 neutropenia TEAEs, 1 patient in the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  1  patient  in  the  physician’s  choice  (bexarotene)  arm  also  experienced 
≥1 TEAE in the infections and infestations SOC. The brentuximab vedotin-treated patient experienced 
cellulitis,  lower  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  the  bexarotene-
treated patient experienced incision site infection, otitis externa, skin infection, and tinea cruris. 
Neutropenia TEAEs required ≥1 dose delay for 4 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm but did not 
require dose reductions, holds, or permanent discontinuations. 
No events of febrile neutropenia were reported in either arm.

IRR 
IRRs  were  reported  only  for  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm,  since  bexarotene  and  methotrexate  are 
orally administered. IRRs occurred in 9 patients (14%) treated with brentuximab vedotin (Table 42).

Two  patients  experienced  ≥1  Grade  3  IRR  (urticaria  and  drug  hypersensitivity).  The  urticaria  IRR 
resulted in study drug discontinuation. All IRR preferred terms were reported in 1 patient each, except 
for Grade 1 pruritus, which was reported in 3 patients. 
None of the IRRs were considered SAEs, and no Grade 4 IRRs or anaphylaxis TEAEs were reported.  
IRRs occurred during Cycle 2 in 8 patients and in Cycle 3 in 2 patients.

Brentuximab Vedotin in ALCANZA Versus the Pivotal Phase 2 and 3 Studies (Safety 
Populations) 
Patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  were  tested  for  the  presence  of  antitherapeutic  antibodies 
(ATAs; Table 43). Of the 9 patients who experienced an IRR in ALCANZA: 
-  1 patient was ATA positive at Baseline and was transiently ATA positive during the study, with 
consistently low titres of ATAs. 
-  5  patients  were  ATA  negative  at  Baseline  and  became  ATA  positive  during  the  study  (3  were 
persistently ATA positive and 2 were transiently ATA positive). 
-  3  patients  were  ATA  negative  at  study  Baseline  and  remained  ATA  negative  throughout  the 
study. 
No correlation could be made between ATA and neutralising antibody (Nab) status and occurrence of 
TEAEs.

Laboratory findings 
Serum  chemistry  abnormalities  reported  as  Grade  3  TEAEs  included  Grade  3  hyperglycaemia, 
hypocalcaemia,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased.  Other  serum  chemistry  abnormalities  reported  as 
TEAEs included Grade 2 hypocalcaemia and hypernatraemia; Grade 1 and Grade 2 GGT increased, AST 
increased, ALT increased, and hyperglycaemia; and Grade 1 transaminases increased, blood creatinine 
increased,  hyponatraemia,  hyposmagnesaemia,  and  hypokalaemia.  A  post  baseline  shift  to  Grade  3 
increased  ALT  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  1  patient  in  the 
physician’s choice arm. 
Abnormal haematology laboratory values reported as TEAEs included Grade 1 and Grade 2 WBC count 
decreased  (2  patients),  Grade  2  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  Grade  1  WBC  count  increased  (1 
patient,  each)  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm,  and  lymphocyte  count  decreased  in  1  patient  in  the 
physician’s  choice  arm.  One  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  had  a  Grade  3  event  of 
thrombocytopenia that resulted in dose delay and resolved. 
Hematologic values were further discussed in the previous section hematologic toxicity. 
ECG 
Grade  1 tachycardia  was reported in  2 patients in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  1  patient  in the 
physician’s  choice  arm.  One  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  had  an  event  of  Grade  1 
bradycardia. No clinically significant abnormal findings were reported for the Safety population.

ECOG performance status 
The shift in ECOG score from baseline to worst post baseline score was no more than 1 point for the 
majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  (88%  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  92%  in  the 
physician’s  choice  arm.  A  shift  of  more  than  1  point  in  worst  post  baseline  score  was  reported  for  8 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 5 patients in the physician’s choice arm. One patient in 
the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  who  had  an  ECOG  score  of  2  at  Baseline  improved  to  a  worst  post 
baseline score of 1 (this patient had an ECOG score of 0 at Cycle 4 through Cycle 16, and at EOT), and 
1 patient in the physician’s choice arm who had an ECOG score of 1 at Baseline improved to a worst 
post baseline score of 0. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in additional CTCL subtypes (from published sources) 
To provide additional support for the safety of brentuximab vedotin in CD30-expressing CTCL subtypes 
that  were  not  included  in the  ALCANZA  study  (LyP  and  more  aggressive  forms  of  CTCL,  such  as  SS, 
and primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma), the applicant discussed results from two Phase 
2 investigator-sponsored trials and published case studies/series. 
Investigator sponsored trials 
-  Kim (2015) 
In this Phase  2 study, patients were included  with MF or  SS stages IB through IVB, who  had 
experienced  ≥1  systemic  therapy  failure.  All  patients  could  receive  up  to  8  cycles  of 
brentuximab  vedotin  (1.8  mg/kg)  administered  every  3  weeks.  Those  showing  continued 
clinical improvement were allowed a maximum of 8 additional cycles (total of 16 cycles); those 
with a CR were allowed to have 2 more cycles. 
Thirty-two  patients  were  enrolled  and  included  in  the  safety  analysis  with  median  age  of  62 
years (range, 20-87 years). Most  patients  had  advanced  disease (88% with stage ≥IIB). The 
median number of prior systemic therapies was 3;  most had  prior cytotoxic agents, one with 
prior  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation.  Only  4  of  the  32  patients  had  ≥50%  CD30 
expression levels. 
Three  SS  patients  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis,  but  safety  data  were  not  reported 
separated  per  CTCL  subtype.  PN  was  a  commonly  observed  toxicity  (66%  of  32  patients). 
Other  toxicities  included  fatigue  (47%),  nausea  (28%),  alopecia  (22%),  and  neutropenia 
(19%).  Three  treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported,  including  1  event  each  of  confusion, 
acute  renal  failure,  and  neuropathy.  Ten  patients  had  a  dose  delay  and/or  reduction  (to  1.2 
mg/kg), and 6 patients (19%) discontinued study treatment because of toxicities. PN was the 
most common cause of dose modification or toxicity-related early termination. Most PN was a 
combined  sensory-motor  neuropathy.  Twelve  of  21  patients  with  PN  had  Grade  2  PN.  By 
Kaplan-Meier  calculation,  the  median  time  to  improvement  of  PN  was  49.0  weeks,  with  59% 
showing improvement or resolution by 12 months and 86% by 24 months. 
-  Duvic (2015) 
In  this  Phase  2  study,  48  patients  (median  age  60)  with  CD30+  LyP,  CD30+  pcALCL  or  MF 
were  included.  Of  these  patients,  9  had  only  CD30+  LyP.  Brentuximab  vedotin  was 
administered  at  1.8  mg/kg  every  21  days  for  up  to  8  doses.  Patients  with  a  PR  or  stable 
disease  could  receive  up  to  8  additional  doses.  Patients  with  a  CR  could  receive  2  additional 
doses.  Patients  with  breakthrough  lesions  could  receive  1.2  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  at  the 
Assessment report

discretion  of  the  investigator.  The  median  number  of  prior  systemic  therapies  was  2  for 
patients  with  MF  and  1  for  patients  with  LyP/pcALCL.  The  median  number  of  cycles  of 
brentuximab vedotin was 7 for MF and 7.5 for LyP/pcALCL. 
Again, safety data were reported in aggregate so safety within a particular CTCL subtype (e.g., 
LyP) cannot be well described. The most common dose-limiting toxicities were sensory PN in 
67%  of  patients  and  fatigue  in  35%.  Grade  1  neuropathy  occurred  in  30  patients,  with 
progression  to  Grade  2  neuropathy  in  21  patients.  Neuropathy  resolved in  14  of  31  patients, 
with  a  median  time  to  resolution  of  41.5  weeks.  Brentuximab  vedotin  was  occasionally 
associated  with  a  tumour  flare,  brisk  inflammation  in  lesions  and  surrounding  skin  that 
resolved as treatment continued. Patients with high CD30 expression could experience itching 
and  burning  of  their  skin  lesions.  A  pruritic  hypersensitivity  drug  rash  with  epidermal 
spongiosis  and  eosinophilia  occurred  in  24%  of  patients  during  Cycles  2  and  3  that  was 
managed with topical corticosteroids. 
Case studies/series 
-  SS 
Three case reports were discussed reporting results of 3 SS patients treated with Brentuximab 
vedotin. The dose  was not mentioned  in one  report, the other two reported an initial dose of 
1.2 followed by 1.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 5 cycles; and 1.8 mg/kg for 2 cycles. No (new) 
adverse events were reported. 
Furthermore, one publication by Lamarque  et  al  (2016) was discussed, reporting the findings 
of  56  peripheral  T-cell  Lymphoma  treated  with  brentuximab  vedotin  (dose  not  presented), 
including  2  patients  with  SS.  Safety  was  reported  in  aggregate.  No  new  safety  signal  was 
reported,  although  two  known  AEs  were  reported  with  a  substantially  higher  frequency  than 
previously  observed:  neutropenia  (37%  vs.  9%  in  ALCANZA  study)  and  thrombocytopenia 
(42% vs. <10% “common” in current SmPC). 
- 
Primary Cutaneous Gamma-delta T-cell Lymphoma 
One case series (Talpur et al, 2016) was presented that included safety results. Four patients 
with  primary  cutaneous  gamma-delta  T-cell  lymphoma  were  presented  that  received 
brentuximab  vedotin  after  various  previous  therapies  had  failed.  The  following  AEs  were 
reported: 
o  Patient 1 received 6 cycles with fatigue being the only reported side effect. 
o  Patient 2 received 7 cycles, and discontinued due to Grade 1 PN. 
o  Patient 3  received  6  cycles  and  discontinued  for  unknown  reason.  Reported AEs  were 
Grade 1 PN and ulcerations on hands. 
o  Patient  4  completed  2  cycles  and  was  continuing  at  the  time  of  the  report.  Reported 
AEs were fatigue, pruritus and mild neuropathy. 
- 
LyP 
Wieser  at  al  (2016)  conducted  a  retrospective  study  of  180  patients  with  LyP  of  whom  21 
patients received brentuximab vedotin. The most commonly reported side effect was PN (in 9 
patients); information on other side effects was not provided in the publication. 
Safety in patients with visceral CTCL involvement 
In  ALCANZA,  12  patients  overall  had  visceral  involvement  at  study  entry,  and  11  (92%)  of  these 
patients were randomised to the brentuximab vedotin arm.

Four of the 5 patients with pcALCL were randomised to receive brentuximab vedotin, and one 
was randomised to the physician’s choice arm and received bexarotene. Among the 4 patients 
with  pcALCL  who  received  with  brentuximab  vedotin,  one  died  after  receiving  1  dose.  The 
cause  of  death  was  reported  as  intestinal  perforation,  multi-organ  failure,  and  pancreatitis, 
which were attributed by the investigator to the therapeutic effect of brentuximab vedotin; the 
patient showed a clinical response after only 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin. Enrolment of this 
patient  into  the  study  constituted  a  violation  of  protocol  eligibility  criteria  because  of  liver 
function test results at Screening. The remaining 3 patients with pcALCL who were assigned to 
receive brentuximab vedotin received >6 treatment cycles.  
-  Among  the  7  patients  with  MF,  all  were  randomised  to  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm.  One  of 
the 7 patients with MF who received brentuximab vedotin discontinued study drug after Cycle 1 
because of a non-serious TEAE of Grade 2 maculopapular rash. The remaining 6 patients with 
MF went on to receive >6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Only  patients  with  adequate  hepatic  and  renal  function  were  included.  No  separate  clinical  study  in 
patients with hepatic or renal impairment has been submitted. 
Paediatric patients 
No data is available in children and adolescents younger than 18 years. 
Elderly 
A  total  of  51  patients  in  the  ALCANZA  study  were  aged  65  years  or  older:  28  patients  in  the 
brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  23  patients  in  the  physician  choice  arm.  No  meaningful  differences  in 
frequency and nature of AEs were observed for patients aged ≥60 years, aged ≥65  years, aged ≥70 
years, or aged ≥75 years versus the patient population as a whole (Table 44).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation 
TEAEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug for 24% of patients (n=16) in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm and 8% (n=5) in the physician’s choice arm. In the brentuximab vedotin arm, more than half of 
the patients (9 out of 16) discontinued study drug because of ≥1 TEAE included in the PN standardised 
MedDRA  query  (SMQ)  search  terms,  including  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (8%),  PN  (3%),  and 
peripheral  motor  neuropathy  and  hypoesthesia  (2%  each).  All  other  TEAEs  that  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation were experienced by not more than 1 patient in either treatment group.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure 
The safety analysis set included 128 randomised patients with the CTCL subtypes pcALCL or MF, who 
received ≥1 dose of any study drug. The safety analysis set of the pivotal trial is considered sufficient, 
Assessment report

Page 88/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
although  information  concerning  uncommon  adverse  events  may  be  limited at  this  time.  Safety  data 
from  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  of  ALCANZA  are  largely  consistent  with  those  of  the  earlier 
monotherapy studies. 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
No new safety signals were detected in the  ALCANZA trial. Almost  every patient experienced at least 
one  TEAE  (95%  with  brentuximab  vedotin  vs.  90%  physician’s  choice).  Although  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs, 
(41%  vs.  47%),  related  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  (29%  in  both  arms)  and  SAEs  (29%  both  arms)  occurred 
with almost similar frequencies in both arms, treatment related TEAEs  (86% vs. 71%) and treatment 
related  SAEs  (14%  vs.  5%)  were  more  frequently  reported  with  brentuximab  vedotin  compared  to 
physician’s choice. Within the physician’s choice arm, more (treatment related) TEAEs and (related) ≥ 
Grade 3 TEAEs were observed with bexarotene, while serious TEAEs and treatment related SAEs were 
observed  more  frequently  with  methotrexate.  However,  the  safety  profile  of  brentuximab  vedotin 
appears  generally  similar  when  compared  to  one  of  the  separate  treatments  or  the  combined 
physician’s choice arm. 
The most common treatment related TEAEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (44% vs.0%), nausea 
(32%  vs.8%),  and  fatigue  (27  vs.  23%).  None  of  the  related  SAEs  occurred  in  >1  patient  in  either 
treatment arm, but three patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (4.5%) experienced Grade 3 SAEs 
in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis, and impetigo. 
An additional safety analysis evaluated the incidence of TEAEs adjusted for study drug exposure, since 
patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  remained  longer  on  study  drug  than  patients  in  the 
physician’s choice arm. When adjusted for total person-year exposure, the incidence density of TEAEs 
in the brentuximab vedotin arm was lower compared with the physician’s choice arm (13.15 vs 14.90 
TEAEs per person-year). This difference resolved after correction for study drug exposure. 
The  total  number  of  deaths  was  16  (24%)  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  14  (23%)  in  the 
physician’s choice  arm. A  higher number of deaths  occurred  within 30 days after the last study drug 
dose in the brentuximab vedotin arm (n=4) vs. the physician’s choice arm (n=0). Only one of these 4 
deaths  was  considered  treatment  related  (multi-organ  failure  including  intestinal  perforation  and 
pancreatitis). Another 3 deaths in the brentuximab vedotin arm were not considered disease-related, 
as  well  as  4  deaths  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm.  The  cause  of  these  deaths  (other  than  disease 
related)  was  assessed  and  no  new  safety  signals  regarding  deaths  related  to  brentuximab  vedotin 
treatment have been revealed. 
TEAEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug for 24% of patients (n=16) in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm  and  8%  (n=5)  in  the  physician’s  choice  arm,  which  is  in  line  with  previous  observed 
discontinuation rates for brentuximab vedotin. Almost half of the patients in the brentuximab vedotin 
arm  discontinued  due  to  peripheral  neuropathy.  All  other  AEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  were  not 
reported for more than one patient. Dose modifications occurred in large proportions of both treatment 
arms  (~73%),  with  peripheral  neuropathy  being  the  most  common  TEAE  resulting  in  dose 
modifications. In the brentuximab vedotin, this mostly consisted of a dose delay (61% vs. 18%), in the 
physician’s  choice  arm  a  dose  modification  mostly  consisted  of  dose  reduction  (26%  brentuximab 
vedotin  vs.  34%  physician’s  choice),  -  increase  (0%  vs.  33%)  or  dose  held  (2%  vs.  26%).  TEAEs 
resulting in dose modifications have been discussed by the applicant during the second and third round 
of  assessment.  No  notable  trend  in  PFS  or  response  rates  could  be  observed  between  patients  that 
discontinued due to AEs vs. patients who remained on treatment, but  no definitive comparisons could 
be performed due to the limited number of patients discontinuing study medication due to AEs.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 89/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among  the  AEs  of  special  interest,  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  observed.  The  safety  data  in 
patients retreated with ADCETRIS (SGN35-006, see section 5.1) were consistent with those observed 
in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies, with the exception of peripheral motor neuropathy, which had 
a  higher  incidence  (28% vs.  9%  in  the  pivotal  phase  2  studies)  and  was  primarily  Grade  2.  Patients 
also  had  a  higher  incidence  of  arthralgia,  Grade  3  anaemia,  and  back  pain  compared  to  patients 
observed  in  the  combined  pivotal  phase  2  studies.  The  observed  frequencies  of  the  AEs  peripheral 
neuropathy  (67%  brentuximab  vedotin  vs.  6%  physician’s  choice),  neutropenia  (9%  vs.  6%)  and 
infusion  related  reactions  (14%  vs.  0%)  were  higher  compared  with  the  comparator  arm,  but in  line 
with or with lower frequencies (neutropenia) than observed in the Phase 3 AETHERA trial in HL. Less-
common  TEAEs  that  have  been  previously  observed  with  brentuximab  vedotin  treatment  (e.g., 
Stevens-Johnson  syndrome/toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  and  progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy) were not reported in the ALCANZA study.  AEs of special interest that 
were defined in previous studies with brentuximab vedotin, including thrombocytopenia and anaemia, 
pulmonary  toxicity,  hepatotoxicity,  hyperglycaemia,  secondary  malignancies,  and  infections,  were 
consistent with the known safety profile of brentuximab vedotin and within the range of that reported 
in  the  SmPC.  In  clinical  trials,  the  majority  of  patients  had  improvement  or  resolution  of  their 
symptoms  of  peripheral  neuropathy  (see  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC).  The  proposed  changes  regarding 
peripheral neuropathy in the SmPC section 4.4 (deletion of incidence) were acceptable as incidences of 
peripheral neuropathy in the different studies were moved to or already included in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The general warning regarding peripheral neuropathy has remained  largely unchanged, and is 
therefore still acceptable. 
Of  the  28  patients  (47%)  that  were  anti-drug  antibody  (ATA)  positive  at  any  post-baseline  visit,  12 
(20%  of  total  number  of  patients  in  the  brentuximab  arm)  were  persistently  ATA  positive.  These 
frequencies  seem  higher  compared  to  the  AETHERA  trial  (>32%  ATA  positive,  8%  persistently 
positive).  It  is  however  reassuring  that  the  frequency  of  IRRs  was  in  line  with  previous  observed 
frequencies, and no relation between ADA status and occurrence of TEAEs has been observed. 
Safety in other CTCL subtypes 
The  case  series/reports  presented  seem  to  reveal  no  new  safety  signal  in  SS,  primary  cutaneous 
Gamma-delta T-cell Lymphoma  or Lyp. Safety  data  has been presented separately for MF and pcALC 
and  despite differences  in  some of  the  safety  parameters  (overall  TEAE  frequency  100%  with  MF  vs. 
81%  with  pcALCL,  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  30%  vs.  13%,  primarily  due  to  peripheral 
neuropathy),  the  overall  safety  profile  seems  largely  similar.  Related  TEAEs,  Grade  ≥3  events  and 
SAEs were reported with almost similar frequencies in MF patients compared to pcALCL patients. The 
safety database is small (n=50 MF vs n=16 pcALCL), however, no strong safety signal has been found 
that might indicate a different safety profile in MF or pcALCL and was similar to that observed in other 
indications (HL, sALCL).  Extrapolation of safety  data to other  more rare  CTCL subtypes can therefore 
be  considered.  However,  since  the  safety  database  is  limited  in  CTCL  subtypes  other  than  MF  and 
pcALCL,  the  safety  of  these  patients  should  be  monitored through  post-marketing  pharmacovigilance 
via PSURs. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, no new safety concerns have been identified with brentuximab vedotin treatment in MF and 
pcALCL patients. Moreover, the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin in patients with MF and pcALCL 
was similar to that observed in other indications (HL, sALCL). Safety data for other rare CD30+ CTCL 
subtypes included in the indication is very limited but nevertheless no findings in the data provided 
Assessment report

could indicate a different safety profile between the different CD30+ CTCL subtypes. The frequency of 
ADRs has been updated in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

The assessor, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation  measures  remains  sufficient  to  minimise  the  risks  of  the  product  in  the  proposed 
indication(s). 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As  a  consequence  of  this  new  indication,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  SmPC  have  been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: a 
user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was conducted in the context of the 
initial marketing authorisation application for Adcetris in 2012. This variation does not change the 
treatment regimen or the safety profile of Adcetris and only introduces minimal changes to the 
package.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
CTCL  is  a  very  rare  disease  group  of  skin-homing  T  cell  neoplasms  with  considerable  variation  in 
clinical  presentation,  histologic  appearance  and  prognosis.  CD30  is  strongly  and  homogeneously 
expressed  (per  definition)  by  pcALCL  and  Lyp,  and  may  also  be  expressed  by  other  CTCL  subtypes, 
however  at  much  lower  and  variable  levels.  In  MF,  the  most  frequent  CTCL  type  (50-60%  of  CTCL) 
varying CD30 levels have been described (0-80%), though most literature indicates lower expression 
rates  (median  10-12%  of  cells  express  CD30).  The  studied  population  included  patients  with  MF 
(incidence 0.3-0.9/100.000) and pcALCL (incidence unknown). There is no standard initial therapy for 
MF  patients,  however,  systemic  options  bexarotene  and  methotrexate  are  frequently  used  in  second 
line (both RR30-50%). Systemic therapies for pcALCL include methotrexate (RR 87%) and bexarotene 
(RR ±50%). Both diseases are characterised by frequent recurrences. pcALCL and the early stages of 
MF have an excellent prognosis, while the advanced stages of MF have a poor prognosis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This  application  is  based  on  one  pivotal  randomised,  open-label,  phase  III  trial  (C25001;  ALCANZA) 
conducted  in  128  patients  with  CD30-positive  (≥10%)  MF  or  pcALCL  (stratified  per  diagnosis),  who 
received  at  least  1  prior  systemic  therapy  (or  prior  radiation  therapy  in  pcALCL).  In  this  study,  the 
effect  of  brentuximab  vedotin  versus  physician’s  choice  of  methotrexate  or  bexarotene  on  the 
proportion of patients with objective response lasting at least 4 months (ORR4) was evaluated. 
Supportive  material  is  derived  from  two  phase  II  investigator  sponsored  trials  in  CTCL  patients  after 
prior systemic therapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  primary  endpoint  ORR4  (objective  response  that  lasted  4  months)  per  IRF  based  on  a  Global 
Response  Score  (GRS)  was  56.3%  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  12.5%  in  the  control  arm 
(p<0.001).  The  results  are  considered  clinically  relevant.  ORR4  was  generally  consistent  across 
subgroups and in different sensitivity analyses.  
Key secondary endpoints (CR, PFS and skin symptoms) were analysed according to a fixed sequential 
testing procedure. The CR rate per IRF was 10 patients (15.6%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 
patient (1.6%) in the physician’s choice arm (adjusted p-value=0.0046). A median PFS differences of 
13 months was observed favouring the brentuximab vedotin arm over the physician’s choice arm with 
a  median  PFS  16.7  vs  3.5  months,  respectively  (HR  0.27;  95%CI  0.17-0.43).  PFS  analyses  were 
performed with a median PFS follow-up of 17.5 months and 67% of the events reached. The treatment 
effect  was  mostly  consistent  across  subgroups.  All  sensitivity  analyses  favoured  the  brentuximab 
vedotin arm over the control arm. 
EFS analyses supports the primary endpoint. Durable response were observed both overall and in the 
skin in both treatment arms. Duration of response (15.1 [95%CI 9.7-25.5] vs 18.3 [95%CI 3.5-18.4]) 
and  duration  of  skin  response  (20.6  [95%CI14.1-25.7]  vs  18.3  [95%CI  3.5-18.9])  are  comparable 
between  the  brentuximab  vedotin  and  control  arm.  OS  data  in  pcALCL  patients  do  not  indicate 
detrimental effects. 
No  differences  in  patient  reported  outcomes  per  FACT-G,  EQ-5D  and  Skindex-29  total  score  were 
observed between the two treatment arms. Skin symptoms as measured by the Skindex-29 symptom 
domain appear to decrease with time in the brentuximab vedotin arm.

Two supportive phase II trials showed anti-tumour activity in the majority of other CTCL subtypes (SS, 
Lyp  and  mixed  CTCL  histology’s  ±  85%  of  CTCL,  together  with  MF  and  pcALCL)  with  CD30 
expression≤10%.  Case  series  additionally  indicate  anti-tumour  activity  of  brentuximab  vedotin  in 
patients with CTCL types primary cutaneous ɣδ T-cell lymphoma and folliculotropic MF (together 6% of 
the CTCL). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL were not included in the pivotal study. Subtypes SS, Lyp and 
mixed  CTCL  histology  were  studied  in  two  non-comparative  phase  II  trials.  The  case  series  in 
cutaneous ɣδ T-cell lymphoma and Lyp were submitted but the evidence is limited. From the remaining 
CTCL subtypes, most of which are very rare, (together<10% CTCL) no data is available.  
Therefore, the size of the treatment effect in CD30 + CTCL subtypes other than  MF and  pcALCL is not 
clear  due  to  lack  of  high  level  evidence.  In  two  single  arm  phase  II  studies  of  brentuximab  vedotin, 
disease  activity  has  been  shown  in  the  subtypes  SS,    LyP  and  mixed  CTCL  histology.  These  data 
suggest  that  efficacy  and  safety  can  be  extrapolated  to  other  CTCL  CD30+  subtypes.  Nevertheless, 
Adcetris should be used with caution in other  CD30+ CTCL patients after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit-risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In study C25001, at least 1 TEAE of any Grade was reported in almost all patients (95% brentuximab 
vedotin vs. 90% physician’s choice). The most frequently reported TEAEs included peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (45% vs. 2%), nausea (36% vs. 13%), diarrhoea (29% vs. 6%), fatigue (29% vs. 27%), 
pruritus (17% vs. 13%), pyrexia (17% vs. 18%), and vomiting (17% vs. 5%). 
When  adjusted  for  total  person-year  exposure,  the  incidence  density  of  TEAEs  in  the  brentuximab 
vedotin arm was lower compared with the physician’s choice arm (13.15 vs 14.90 TEAEs per person-
year). 
Treatment  related  TEAEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  (86%  vs. 
71%). The most common treatment related TEAEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (44% vs.0%), 
nausea (32% vs.8%), and fatigue (27 vs. 23%). 
SAEs were reported in 29% of patients in both treatment arms. Treatment related SAEs occurred more 
frequently with brentuximab vedotin (14% vs. 5%). None of the related events occurred in >1 patient 
in either treatment arm, but three patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (4.5%) experienced Grade 
3 SAEs in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis, and impetigo. 
The  total  number  of  deaths  was  16  (24%)  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  14  (23%)  in  the 
physician’s choice  arm. A  higher number of  deaths  occurred within 30 days after the last study drug 
dose  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  (n=4)  vs.  the  physician’s  choice  arm  (n=0).  One  of  these  4 
deaths  was  considered  treatment  related  (multi-organ  failure  including  intestinal  perforation  and 
pancreatitis). 
Assessment report  
EMA/753623/2017  
Page 97/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A  higher  frequency  of  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to 
AEs  (24%  vs.  8%  with  physician’s  choice).  The  most  common  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  was 
peripheral  neuropathy.  Dose  modifications  occurred  in  large  proportions  of  both  treatment  arms 
(~73%).  In  the  brentuximab  vedotin,  this  mostly  consisted  of  a  dose  delay  (61%  vs.  18%),  in  the 
physician’s  choice  arm  a  dose  modification  mostly  consisted  of  dose  reduction  (26%  brentuximab 
vedotin vs. 34% physician’s choice), - increase (0% vs. 33%) or dose held (2% vs. 26%). 
As expected, higher frequencies of the AEs of special interest peripheral neuropathy (67% brentuximab 
vedotin vs. 6% physician’s choice), neutropenia (9% vs. 6%) and infusion related reactions (14% vs. 
0%) were observed compared with the comparator arm.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Literature  based  safety  data  for  patients  with  other,  more  rare  CD30+  CTCL  subtypes  than  MF  or 
pcALCL  included  in  the  proposed  indication  is  considered  very  limited.  The  case  series/reports 
presented seem to reveal no new safety signal in  SS, primary cutaneous  ɣδ  T-cell lymphoma or Lyp. 
However,  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  analysed  and 
incomplete  safety  data  for  these  patients.  Therefore,  safety  information  in  other  more  rare  CD30+ 
CTCL subtypes will be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance activities.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A higher number of responses lasting at least 4 months were observed in the brentuximab vedotin arm 
compared  to  the  control  arm.  This  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (ORR4)  is  supported  with  a  compelling 
and  clinically  relevant  PFS  difference  and  ORR,  CR  and  EFS  favouring  brentuximab  vedotin  over 
bexarotene/methotrexate. Therefore, the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin is considered demonstrated 
in  the  studied  population  of  MF  and  pcALCL  patients  who  received  at  least  1  prior  systemic  therapy. 
The OS data does not show a detrimental effect thus far but the data are still immature for the pcALCL 
and  the  MF  population.  Considering  the  totality  of  the  data  and  the  effect  of  many  subsequent 
therapies on OS, this uncertainty is regarded acceptable.  
Although  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  (41%  vs.  47%),  related  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  (29%  in  both  arms)  and  SAEs 
(29%  both  arms)  occurred  with  almost  similar  frequencies  in  both  arms,  treatment  related  TEAEs 
(86%  vs.  71%)  and  treatment  related  SAEs  (14%  vs.  5%)  were  more  frequently  reported  with 
brentuximab  vedotin  compared  to  physician’s  choice.  Likewise,  treatment  discontinuation  occurred 
more frequently in the brentuximab vedotin arm (24% vs. 8%). Although the toxicity of brentuximab 
vedotin  in  the  ALCANZA  trial  is  considered  substantial,  safety  data  are  largely  consistent  with  the 
earlier monotherapy studies, and no new safety signals were reported.  
No  new  safety  signal  has  been  found  that  might  indicate  a  different  safety  profile  in  MF  or  pcALCL, 
despite the difference  in CD30+  expression and tumour load between these  different CTCL subtypes.

Because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease,  it  is  likely  that  there  may  be  difficulties  in  acquiring  additional 
comprehensive data in the CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL. Currently, there is limited data 
on the safety in the rarest CTCL subtypes (<10% CTCL). The totality of the data provided indicate that 
the  safety  profile  in  CD30+  CTCL  subtypes  will  likely  be  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of 
brentuximab vedotin. It is considered that the safety in the CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL 
should be monitored post-marketing. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  randomised  phase  III  C25001  trial  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  brentuximab 
vedotin  compared  to  physician’s  choice  chemotherapy  in  MF  and  pcALCL  patients.  Based  on  the 
efficacy  data,  the  clinical  benefit  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  other  rarer  subtypes  of  CD30+CTCL.  No 
new  safety  signals  have  been  reported  for  these  patients  and  the  presented  frequencies  and  ADRs 
seem  consistent  with  previous  observed  safety  data  for  brentuximab  vedotin  monotherapy  in  HL. 
Therefore,  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  the  proposed  indication  “ADCETRIS  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  CD30+  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  after  at  least  1  prior 
systemic therapy (see section 5.1)” is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The proposed indication in the studied population consisted of patients who had received a median of 2 
systemic  therapies.  Extrapolation  of  benefit/risk  from  second  line  to  first  line  setting  was  highly 
uncertain  due  to  the  lack  of  efficacy  comparing  brentuximab  vedotin  with  possibly  less  toxic  and 
effective  treatment  options  in  first  line  setting  (e.g.  mono  or  combination  therapy  of  ECP,  total  skin 
EBT, PUVA, interferon and retinoids). There was concern that there could also be possible differences 
in the risk factors in patient populations being treated in first and second line plus setting (related to 
disease  stage,  CD30  expression,  disease  transformation  etc.).  Therefore,  the  extrapolation  to  the 
broader  indication  was  not  acceptable  and  a  restriction  to  patients  that  had  been  previously  treated 
with at least 1 prior systemic therapy, which reflects the patient population that had been included in 
the main pivotal study. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  was  positive  for  CD30+  CTCL.  It  is  regarded  that 
the benefit-risk in MF/pcALCL patients can be extrapolated to other CD30+ patients. The uncertainties 
regarding  the  effect  size  in  other  CTCL  types  than  MF/pcALCL  should  be  considered  in  the  light  of 
difficulties of performing trials in this very rare disease (SmPC section 4.4).

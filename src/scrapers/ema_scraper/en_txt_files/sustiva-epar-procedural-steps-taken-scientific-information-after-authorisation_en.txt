Two published cases suggested an interaction between 
efavirenz and Ginkgo biloba extracts with a negative impact 
on efavirenz concentration and/or on viral load. A 
deleterious pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz 
and Ginkgo biloba extracts is plausible. Ginkgo biloba 
extracts can induce enzymes that may give rise to 
decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. This 
information was reflected in the product information of 
efavirenz-containing medicinal products by stating that 
concomitant use of Gingko biloba extracts is not 
recommended.

In a drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers 
coadministration of efavirenz with the antimalarial 
artemisinin-based combination therapy 
artemether/lumefantrine resulted in reduced exposure 
(AUC) to artemether, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and 
lumefantrine. Since reduced drug concentrations may result 
in decreased antimalarial efficacy, caution is recommended 
r   a
when efavirenz and artemether/ lumefantrine are 
coadministered. 
In addition, the MAH clarified that efavirenz can be 
exceptionally coadministered with the fixed-dose 
combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate, if needed for dose-adjustment (for 
example with rifampicin).

SmPC and PL 
As of July 2010, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has 
received prospective reports of 718 pregnancies with first 
trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, 
resulting in 604 live births. One child was reported to have 
a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of 
other birth defects were similar to those seen in children 
exposed to non efavirenz containing regimens, as well as 
those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube 
defects in the general population ranges from 0.5 1 case 
per 1,000 live births. All together there have been six 
retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube 
defects, including meningomyelocele, all in mothers 
exposed to efavirenz containing regimens in the first 
trimester. A causal relationship of these events to the use 
of efavirenz has not been established, and the denominator 
is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 
weeks of foetal development (at which time neural tubes 
are sealed), this potential risk would concern women 
exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. 
The SmPC was updated to reflect these data and the 
Page 18/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
restriction for women with childbearing potential for 
efavirenz was revised as follows: Efavirenz should not be

condition requires such treatment. Additionally, women of 
childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing 
before initiation of efavirenz. Prescribers are referred to

Following assessment of PSUR 12, the CHMP recommended 
to amend the SPC of efavirenz in order to include a 
interaction information with the anticoagulant warfarin. No 
interaction study has been performed. Warfarin is 
administered as a racemate; the S-enantiomer provides 
most of the anticoagulation effect and is metabolized by 
r   a
CYP2C9 while the R-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP3A4. 
Efavirenz is an inducer of CYP3A4 and in vitro data have 
indicated that it is also an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Due to these 
dual properties of efavirenz, the following information was 
added: an increase or decrease in warfarin exposures and 
effects could be observed if co administered with efavirenz. 
Dose adjustment of warfarin may be required. The PL was 
updated accordingly. In addition, a review of the MAH 
safety database has shown the following additional adverse 
reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing 
antiretroviral treatment regimens: flushing, tinnitus, and 
tremor. These were therefore added to the SPC. The PL 
was updated accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to 
also reorder the MedDRA system organ class listing of 
events from clinical trials according to the most recent 
version (Version 12.0, February 2009).

as to the potential negative impact on the efficacy of the 
hormonal combination. Consequently it is recommended 
that for patients taking EFV 600 mg once daily a reliable 
d
e
method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to 
ri s

oral hormonal contraceptives. 
r   a
In a study reported in the published literature, no 
significant differences in depo-medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (DMPA) pharmacokinetic parameters were found 
between subjects receiving EFV-containing antiretroviral 
therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. 
u t h
Similar results were found in study ACTG 5093 (although 
the DMPA plasma levels were found to be more variable). 
In these studies, plasma progesterone levels for subjects 
receiving EFV and DMPA remained low consistent with 
suppression of ovulation. However due to the global limited 
information available, a reliable method of barrier 
contraception must be used in addition to injectable 
hormonal contraceptives containing DMPA.  
The interaction between EFV and the implantable hormonal 
contraceptive, etonogestrel, has not been studied; 
however, there have been reports of unplanned 
pregnancies in women taking both, possibly due to 
induction of metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4 by EFV. 
Thus, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be 
used in addition to implantable hormonal contraceptives 
when taking EFV.

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be

adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Sustiva continues 
to be favourable. The CHMP recommends the renewal of 
the Marketing Authorisation for Sustiva but requires an

additional five-year renewal on the basis of 
pharmacovigilance grounds.

The hepatic toxicity is a known risk but is a remaining 
concern. The number of spontaneous reports on hepatic 
toxicity and acute or sub-acute chronic hepatitis potentially 
serious and fatal presented in subject without other known 
risk factors is a matter of concern in particular in view of 
the evolving therapeutic management of HIV infected 
patients. As newer therapeutic options for the treatment of 
HIV infection become available, the benefit/risk balance 
should be continuously reassessed in light of the 
introduction of these new options into treatment regimens.

Furthermore, changes were made focusing on drug

pharmacokinetics data. Taking into account the potential 
differences in exposure to EFV related to 
gender/ethnic/gene polymorphism, an increase in 
frequency/severity of AEs cannot be strictly ruled out, but 
this is unlikely to have a significant clinical impact.

Diltiazem dose adjustment following co-administration with

As stated in the product information of atazanavir 
(Reyataz),  the co-administration of efavirenz with 
atazanavir in combination with low-dose ritonavir decreases 
the exposure of atazanavir. A dosage adjustment of 
atazanavir is therefore recommended although no efficacy 
and safety data are available to support the proposed 
increased atazanavir dose to 400 mg with ritonavir when 
co-administrated with efavirenz. Limited data further 
suggest that using efavirenz in a regimen including low 
dose ritonavir, may cause an increase in the incidence of 
efavirenz-associated adverse events. This information has 
been included in section 4.5 of the SPC and reflected in 
section 2 of the PL.

positively affected when the hard capsules were taken in 
the fed state and that for the tablets the impact seemed 
even greater. As a post-renewal commitment the MAH 
submitted a safety comparison between the hard capsules 
and the film-coated tablets derived from clinical trials, 
spontaneous and literature reports. Following the 
assessment of this data the CHMP concluded that in the 
presence of food an increase of efavirenz serum 
concentration and an increase of the frequency of adverse 
reactions was observed. As this effect could be more 
evident for the film-coated tablets than for the hard 
capsules, the CHMP requested the update of the SPC and 
PL of both solid formulations to recommend the 
administration of Sustiva on an empty stomach preferable 
at bedtime to improve the tolerability of nervous system 
undesirable effects.

information on the interaction between efavirenz and 
voriconazol as requested by the CHMP in August 
2004.  
Furthermore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
applied for the update of section 4.5 of the Summary 
of Product Characteristics to clarify the safety 
concerns of the interaction between efavirenz and 
CYP450 metabolised products. 
The MAH has taken this opportunity to amend the 
Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet to reflect the unit dose blister 
presentation, to specify the type of container, in 
accordance with the latest EMEA/QRD templates and 
to update the list of the local representatives in the

Sustiva hard capsules of bottle and blister outer

In patients treated with any type of combination

antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment.  
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not yet been 
detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of 
CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection 
(OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for 
the complications most feared in this context; CMV-
retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  An additional reason for 
treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially is the 
great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due 
to drug interactions.  
The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune 
system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and 
the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory 
reaction is considering to be important to the clinical 
handling of the patients. Therefore, the CHMP further to the 
assessment of MAH's responses and discussions held at the 
pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, a class

5.1 was updated to reflect these results. 
The long-term safety of the EFV+ZDV+3TC treatment 
regimen was not different from the already defined safety 
profile of EFV. The incidences of nervous system symptoms 
and rash beyond the 48 week of treatment were low.  The 
long-term safety profile in patients with HCV and/or HBV 
co-infection was not different from the previously profile 
known in this subset of patients. Section 4.8 of the SPC, 
subheading "nervous system symptoms" and "laboratory 
test abnormalities" were updated in regard of these 
observations.

Furthermore, the MAH has taken this opportunity to 
update section 4.4 of the SPC, by reordering the 
wording on lactose (for the 300 and 600 mg tablet 
formulations only), on cholesterol and on 
lipodystrophy. The MAH also updated the SPC 
according to the latest EMEA/QRD templates with 
regard to the expression of cross references between 
sections.  
In addition, the MAH has proposed to update the 
Package leaflet (PL) in line with the proposed 
changes of the SPC and to include the wording on 
lipodystrophy as adopted by the CPMP on 24 March 
2003.

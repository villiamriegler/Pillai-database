1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Mylan S.A.S submitted on 29 July 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, 
through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004– ‘Generic of 
a Centrally authorised product’. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the 
EMA/CHMP on 25 June 2015. 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product, as defined in Article 10 (2)(a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the basis of 
a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication  
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA 
levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three 
months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and 
must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to 
any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan prior to 
initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The demonstration of the benefit of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is primarily based on 
48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a 
combination antiretroviral therapy changed to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see 
section 5.1). No data are currently available from clinical studies with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients. 
No data are available to support the combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and 
other antiretroviral agents. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC). 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data and a 
bioequivalence study with the reference medicinal product Atripla instead of non-clinical and clinical

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 600mg/200mg/245mg mg Film Coated tablet has 
been submitted under Article 10(1) (generic of a reference medicinal product) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
as amended. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a fixed-dose combination of 
efavirenz,emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil and the proposed indication is for the treatment of 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic 
suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy 
for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior 
antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations 
conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral 
treatment regimen. 
The demonstration of the benefit of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil is primarily based on 
48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a combination 
antiretroviral therapy changed to Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil. No data are currently 
available from clinical studies with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in 
heavily pretreated patients. 
Efavirenz is an NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz non-competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) 
and does not significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) RT or cellular 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases (α, β, γ, and δ). Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of

cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil maleate is converted in-vivo to Tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate 
(nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir are phosphorylated 
by cellular enzymes to form Emtricitabine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In-
vitro studies have shown that both Emtricitabine and Tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when 
combined together in cells. 
Emtricitabine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, 
resulting in DNA chain termination. 
The proposed commercial formulation is an immediate-release film-coated 600mg+200mg+245mg 
tablet. The recommended dose is one tablet taken orally once daily on an empty stomach. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

Efavirenz 
General information 
The chemical name of efavirenz is (4S) -6-chloro-4-( cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4 -dihydro-4-
(trifluoromethy 1)-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C14H9ClF3NO2 and 
has a relative molecular mass 315.68 g/mol and has the following structure (Figure 1): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 8/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Structure of efavirenz 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass 
spectroscopy, elemental analysis and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). 
Efavirenz is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water, practically insoluble over a pH 
range 1.2 – 8.0. Its pKa is 10.2. Efavirenz exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral 
centre. The isomer produced by the manufacturer corresponds to the S-isomer. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral specific optical rotation (R-isomer NMT 0.50%). 
Efavirenz is known to exhibit polymorphism and exists in many polymorphic forms, i.e. Form-I, Form-I, 
Form-III, Form-IV, Form-V & Form-β. PXRD data confirms that the manufacturer produces Form-β 
consistently and that it remains stable upon storage. Polymorph identification test by PXRD is included 
in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Efavirenz is synthesized in three main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specification. 
The  critical  process  parameters  have  been  presented  and  adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied 
during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting 
materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  Powder  processing  steps  (Micronization  /  Compaction / 
Milling / Sieving / Blending) are performed in order to produce the required particle size/bulk density. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packed  in  double  polyethylene  bags  which  are  in  turn  packed  in  triple 
laminated  aluminium  packs,  heat  sealed,  and  placed  in  HDPE  containers  which  comply  with  the  Ph. 
Eur. and relevant EC regulations 2015/174. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, solubility, identification (IR, HPLC, 
XRD), water content (KF), specific optical rotation ([]D
metals (Ph. Eur.),  related substances (HPLC), Enantiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual 
25 in methanol), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy 
solvents (GC), amino alcohol impurity (LC-MS/MS), Microbiology analysis (Ph. Eur.) and particle size 
(Malvern).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 3 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale and three pilot scale batches of active substance from the 
proposed manufacturer for 24 months and 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
Efavirenz stability batches were stored in simulated market packaging with the following configuration: 
first packed in LDPE bag as primary pack then kept in HMLDPE bag as secondary pack, and finally the 
triple laminated aluminum bag used as tertiary pack, similar to packing conditions of commercial 
packages. 
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, HPLC, XRD), water content (KF), 
specific optical rotation, related substances (HPLC), enantiomer content (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications.  
Forced degradation studies were carried out under: acid, base, oxidative, thermal (60ºC) and UV 
degradation conditions in solution state, and thermal (105ºC) and photolytic (white fluorescence light 
and UV at 365 nm) conditions in solid state. Significant degradation was observed in basic media 
(hydrolysis) and under UV irradiation. A slight increase in the enantiomer content was also detected in 
basic media. The forced degradation studies confirmed the stability-indicating nature of related 
substances and assay methods. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed 
container. 
Emtricitabine 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-
5-yl]-2(1H)-pyrimidinone corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 247.24 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 2): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 10/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Structure of emtricitabine 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H- and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRD. 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white crystalline powder, non-hygroscopic, freely soluble in 
methanol and water and soluble in ethanol. Its pKa is 4.90 and the partition coefficient LogP is -0.43. 
It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. There are four possible isomers due 
to these asymmetric carbons in the molecule and the isomer 2R,5S is commercially produced. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical rotation.  
Various polymorphs of emtricitabine exist (Form I, Form II, Form III and amorphous form). XRD data 
confirms that the manufacturer consistently produces the same form and that it remains stable upon 
storage. Polymorph identification test by XRD is included in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Emtricitabine is synthesized in six main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
The critical process parameters were presented and justified. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
The active substance is packed in polyethylene bags (LDPE) inside HDPE drums which comply with the 
European Pharmacopeia and relevant EU regulations. 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for description (visual), solubility (Eur. Ph.), 
identification (IR, HPLC, PXRD), melting range (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), loss on 
drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), content of emtricitabine enantiomer 
(chiral HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), content of 
triethylamine (GC), formaldehyde content (UPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction particle).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 11/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The set limits in the active substance specification are sufficiently justified and the acceptance criteria 
of the related substances are in accordance with ICH guidelines. The limits for residual solvents are in 
accordance with the ICH Q3C guideline except for triethylamine for which the acceptance criteria is 
adequately justified toxicologically. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately discussed and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from six production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on six production scale batches (from both proposed manufacturers) and three pilot scale 
batches (from one of the manufacturers) of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
package for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up to 36 months 
under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH or for up to 24 months at alternative conditions 
30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH, according to 
the ICH guidelines, was provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, HPLC), melting range, specific 
optical rotation, loss on drying, limit of emtricitabine enantiomer, related substances and assay. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Results on forced degradation studies (stress studies and solid state stability studies) were also 
provided as part of the related substances method validation of. Exposure to acid hydrolysis, basic 
hydrolysis, oxidation, heat degradation and UV as well as white fluorescence light, UV at 365 nm and 
heat at 105 ºC in solid state was measured. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. The degradation of emtricitabine is significantly 
increased upon exposure to acid, base and heat. The major degradants formed were S-oxide and 
desamino. Emtricitabine solutions were found to be stable under UV exposure. No degradation was 
observed in solid state indicating that emtricitabine is stable upon exposure to white fluorescent light, 
UV light and heat at 105 ºC. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed 
packaging and the storage precaution “Store below 30 ºC”. 
Tenofovir disoproxil 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil (as maleate) is bis({[propan-2-yloxy)carbonyl]oxy}methyl) 
({[2R)-1-(6-amino-9Hpurin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]oxy}methyl)phosphonate(2Z)-but-2-enedioate, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C19H30N5O10P∙C4H4O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 
635.51 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 3): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 12/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Structure of tenofovir disoproxil maleate 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRD. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, freely soluble 
in DMF and soluble in aqueous solutions (pH 1.2-8.0) and methanol. Its pKa is 3.5 and its partition 
coefficient is 0.67.  
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre at C-11 
(the C-2 position of the propyl side-chain). Two isomers are possible due to this asymmetric carbon. 
The R-isomer is commercially produced. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and 
specific optical rotation. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate exhibits polymorphism and different forms are reported in the literature 
(form I and form II). The PXRD method distinguishes the polymorphic forms and PXRD data confirmed 
that a single polymorphic form is consistently produced and that it is stable upon storage. Three 
tenofovir disoproxil maleate batches were undergone compaction followed by milling. The milled 
tenofovir disoproxil maleate batches were analysed by PXRD. The XRD pattern comparison 
demonstrated that compaction followed by milling operations does not affect polymorphism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance was provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil maleate is synthesized in three main steps using commercially available well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the relevant EU 
guidance. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The active substance is packed in double polyethylene bags which are in turn packed in triple 
laminated aluminium packs, heat sealed, and placed in HDPE containers which comply with the Ph. 
Eur. and relevant EC regulations 2015/174. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), solubility (visual), 
identification (IR, HPLC), identification of maleic acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual), water content 
(KF), sulfated ash (in house), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), S-isomer content (chiral HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), chloromethyl isopropyl carbonate (GC), 9-
propenyl adenine (LC-MS), impurities (sum of diethyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate and tosyl 
phosphonate) (LC-MS), formaldehyde content (UPLC), total genotoxic impurities (LC-MS, UPLC) and 
particle size (laser diffraction). 
All the proposed specification limits are considered justified and in line with the relevant ICH 
guidelines. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three consecutive production scale batches of the active substance were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. Stability studies under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) were 
conducted.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, HPLC), water content (KF), S-
isomer content (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. 
Results from forced degradation studies were also provided. Tenofovir disoproxil maleate was exposed 
to aqueous acid, aqueous base, oxidant, heat and UV. Solid samples were exposed to white fluorescent 
light (according to ICH Q1B), UV at 365 nm and heat at 60 ºC. 
Significant degradation of tenofovir disoproxil maleate was observed in solution under alkaline, acid 
and oxidative conditions and when exposed to heat or UV light. No significant degradation was 
observed in solid state when samples were exposed to heat or white fluorescent light but slight 
degradation was observed on exposure to UV light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 12 months in the proposed 
container and the storage precaution “store below 25 ºC”.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Efavirenz,  Emtricitabine  and  Tenofovir  disoproxil  600  mg/200  mg/245  mg  Film-coated  tablets  [20.65 
mm x 10.90 mm] are described as a pink film-coated, capsule shaped, biconvex, beveled edge tablet 
debossed with "M" on one side of the tablet and "TME" on the other side. 
Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil 600mg/200mg/245mg Film-coated tablets are packed 
in round wide mouth white High Density Polyethylene  (HDPE) bottle with white opaque polypropylene 
screw cap with aluminium induction sealing liner wad and desiccant. The HDPE bottle pack may either 
be placed in an outer cardboard carton or provided without a carton based on commercial requirement. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. The Opadry pink coating material is proprietary material supplied to an agreed specification 
and the individual components used in its manufacturing comply with the Ph. Eur. and EU regulation 
231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The  formulation  of  Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  disoproxil  Mylan  600mg/200mg/245mg  Film-
coated tablets is based on the literature search and characterization of reference  product, i.e. Atripla 
600  mg/200  mg/245  mg  Film-coated  tablets  (Bristol-Myers  Squib  and  Gilead  Sciences  Limited, 
Ireland). 
Compatibility  studies  with  the  drug  substances  and  excipients  have  been  done  and  demonstrate  that 
the drug substances (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil maleate) are compatible with all 
the excipients intended to use in the product development. Solubility studies of efavirenz, emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil maleate were carried out in different pH buffers. 
The  feasibility  of  the  various  approaches  was  evaluated  for  the  formulation  development  of  tablets 
(Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  disoproxil  Mylan  600mg/200mg/245mg  Film-coated  tablets)  as 
follows:  optimization  of  excipients  in  emtricitabine  portion  in  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil 
maleate  layer  (optimization  of  diluents:  cellulose,  microcrystalline  and  lactose  monohydrated; 
optimization  of  lubricant:  magnesium  stearate;  optimization  of  glidant:  silica,  colloidal  anhydrous); 
optimization  of  excipients  in  extra-granular  portion  in  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  maleate 
layer  (optimization of  disintegrant:  low-substituted hydroxypropyl  cellulose; optimization  of  lubricant: 
magnesium  stearate;  optimization  of  stabilizer:  sodium  metabisulfite);  optimization  of  excipients  in 
efavirenz  layer  (optimization  of  diluent:  cellulose,  microcrystalline  and  lactose  monohydrate; 
optimization  of  binder:  hydroxypropylcellulose;  optimization  of  disintegrant:  croscarmellose  sodium; 
optimization  of  lubricant:  magnesium  stearate);  optimization  of  film  coating  (Opadry  II  pink 
85F540043). 
The  dissolution  profile  of  Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  disoproxil  Mylan  600mg/200mg/245mg 
Film-coated  tablets  (Batch  No  2007328,  BE  batch)  and  Atripla  600mg/200mg/245mg  Film-coated 
tablets  (Batch  No  PVPVD,  BE  batch)  was  compared  in  different  media  in  purified  water  with  2  % 
sodium lauryl sulphate (release media), 0.1N HCl with 2% SLS, pH 4.5 acetate buffer with 2% SLS and 
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer with 2% SLS covering the pH range  of pH 1.2 - pH 6.8. The results indicate 
that the dissolution profiles of the test product (Biobatch) and reference product are similar (more than 
85% dissolution after 15 minutes) for emtricitabine in the all media tested, are similar (more than 85% 
dissolution  after  15  minutes)  for  tenofovir  disoproxil  maleate in  purified  water  with  2  %  SLS,  pH  4.5 
acetate buffer  with  2%  SLS  and  pH  6.8  phosphate buffer  with  2%  SLS  and  are  similar  (f2  >  50)  for 
Assessment report

efavirenz in pH 4.5 acetate buffer with 2.0% SLS. The values of f2 are found to be < 50 for efavirenz 
in purified water with 2 % SLS, 0.1N HCl with 2.0% SLS and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer with 2.0% SLS 
and  for  tenofovir  disoproxil  maleate  in  0.1N  HCl  with  2.0%  SLS.  This  may  be  due  to  differences  in 
qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in  excipients  and  in  the  manufacturing  process  between  test 
and reference product. However, as the test product was demonstrated to be bio-equivalent with the 
reference product, the differences observed between the dissolution profiles in certain media were not 
considered relevant. 
To evaluate the effect of particle size of the drug substances on dissolution, studies were undertaken 
with  tablets  manufactured  with  lots  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  of  varying 
particle  size.  The  tablets  were  evaluated  for  weight  variation,  thickness,  hardness  and  dissolution 
profile.  All  the  physical  parameters  and  the  dissolution  profile  were  found  to  be  satisfactory  in  the 
tablets prepared using efavirenz, emtricitabine  and  tenofovir disoproxil maleate drug  substances  with 
particle  size  distributions  in  the  ranges  proposed  for  commercial  manufacture.  The  final  agreed 
formulation  for  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  600mg/200mg/245mg  film-coated 
tablets  consist  of  two  layers.  Dry  granulation  technique  was  selected  for  the  tenofovir  disoproxil 
maleate  and  emtricitabine  layer  due  to  their  very  poor  flow  characteristics.  Wet  granulation  process 
was chosen for efavirenz layer based on its low solubility and very poor flow characteristics. 
The possible variables during various stages involved in manufacturing process were identified and the 
effect of the critical variables on the performance of the formulation was evaluated.  
Dissolution method development was conducted in parallel with formulation and process development 
of  the  current  600/200/245  mg  tablet.  The  dissolution  method  used  for  the  routine  analysis  of 
Efavirenz,  Emtricitabine  and  Tenofovir  disoproxil  600/200/245  mg  Tablets,  is  as  follows:  1000  ml  of 
Purified water with 2.0 % Sodium lauryl sulphate, Apparatus II - Paddle, 100 rpm. The justification for 
the selection of the dissolution medium, use of surfactant and the concentration used, agitation speed 
and  dissolution  volume  are  provided;  whereas  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  are  BCS  class  1 
and 3 respectively, efavirenz is the least soluble of the three active substances (low solubility according 
to BCS), and required selection of these parameters to achieve full dissolution and sink conditions. 
The  suitability  of  dissolution  method  with  respect  to  discrimination  was  investigated  with  respect  to 
formulation  and  manufacturing  process  changes.  The  selected  dissolution  conditions  are  appropriate 
for 
the 
routine 
release 
testing 
of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil  Mylan 
600mg/200mg/245mg  Film-coated  tablets.  Based  on  these  experiments  the  discriminatory  power  of 
the dissolution method has been demonstrated. The proposed specification limit for dissolution for all 
three drug substances in the release and shelf-life specifications was accepted. 
The primary packaging is round wide mouth white High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with white 
opaque  polypropylene  screw  cap  with  aluminium  induction  sealing  liner  wad  and  desiccant.  The 
material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps:  
1.  Preparation of efavirenz blend 
(Sifting; Granulation; Drying; Dry screening: Sifting of extragranular materials, 
Blending), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 16/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Preparation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil maleate blend 
(Sifting; Pre-compaction blending: Blender, Compaction; Milling and Sifting; Mixing: 
Blender), 
3.  Manufacturing of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil Tablets using the 
blends manufactured in step 1 and step 2 (as a bi-layered tablets) 
(Sifting of extra granular materials; Final Blending: Blender; Compression) 
4.  Film-coating of compressed tablets followed by packaging 
The intermediates of the manufacturing process have been clearly specified and the absence of holding 
times has been justified. Critical steps of the process have been identified as follows: preparation of 
efavirenz layer, preparation of emtricitabine portion, preparation of tenofovir disoproxil maleate 
portion, preparation of final blend for emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil maleate layer and 
compression and coating. Appropriate in-process controls are applied throughout the process and are 
adequately justified. The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers 
a product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies of smaller pilot scale batches. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing  process  /  pharmaceutical  form.  As  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  to  be 
standard process, the proposed larger production scale batch size has been accepted, as the applicant 
has  presented  an  acceptable  process  validation  protocol/scheme  to  be  completed  prior  to 
commercialisation of the product. 
In  conclusion,  it  is  considered  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  robust  to  provide 
assurance  that  film-coated  tablets  of  consistent  quality,  complying  with  the  designated  specification, 
are produced. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
description, identification  (HPLC,  TLC), identification  of  maleic  acid (HPLC), identification of colorants, 
dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
monoester  impurity  of tenofovir  disoproxil  maleate  (HPLC),  Water  (KF),microbiological  test  (Ph.  Eur.) 
and sodium metabisulfite (HPLC). 
The proposed limits for related substances have been appropriately justified in line with the relevant 
ICH guidelines. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four batches of pilot production scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of two pilot production scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate stability conditions for 12 months (30 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017

± 2°C /65 ± 5% RH) and for up to 3 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Stability data of two additional pilot production scale 
batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 9 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 
under intermediate stability conditions for 9 months (30 ± 2°C /65 ± 5% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were also provided.  
The  stability  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for description, assay, 
estimation  of  sodium  metabisulfite,  dissolution,  related  substances,  Water  and  Microbial  limits.  The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results confirmed that the finished product is photostable.  
Forced  degradation  studies  confirmed  the  suitability  of  the  HPLC  assay  and  degradation  product 
methods for use in the analysis of stability samples.  
The finished product batches did not comply with the proposed finished product shelf life specification 
during initial accelerated stability studies performed on HDPE bottle pack. Therefore, the Applicant has 
performed intermediate stability studies. The data presented indicates that the product complies with 
the proposed finished product shelf life specification during intermediate and long term stability studies 
in HDPE bottle pack. 
Therefore,  based  on  this  available  stability  data,  a  proposed  shelf-life  of  18  months  for  the  product 
packed  in  HDPE  bottle  pack  and  the  storage  conditions  of  “Do  not  store  above  25˚C.  Store  in  the 
original package in order to protect from light”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. 
In-use stability studies for 30 days have been performed on various batches after 1 month, 6 months 
24  months  on  long-term  storage,  and  a  further  study  will  be  performed  after  36  months  storage. 
Based on available in-use stability data, the proposed in-use shelf-life of “use within 30 days after first 
opening”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), is also acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan manufactured by Mylan S.A.S. is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil containing products and the exposure of the environment 
to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as well as efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
combination have been sufficiently well characterised by standard methodological approaches and the 
available studies indicate, from a non-clinical point of view, a positive risk/benefit profile for its 
intended clinical use. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan and justifications that the different salt of the active substance does not differ 
significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided 
and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non 
clinical studies were not considered necessary.

Business & Technology Park, Carrigtohill, County Cork, Ireland in healthy males and females (not of 
child-bearing potential). 
Methods 
Study design  
The Fixed Dose Combination Product in this application is essentially similar to the existing individual 
licensed product, Atripla (Efavirenz 600 mg/ Emtricitabine 200 mg/ Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as 
fumarate) film-coated tablets’ of Bristol- Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences Limited, IDA Business & 
Technology Park, Carrigtohill, County Cork, Ireland. The active ingredient and the route of 
administration are the same for both products.  
Single bioequivalence study was conducted in fasting state in healthy volunteers; comparing the 
applicant’s Efavirenz/ Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil 600mg/ 200mg/ 245mg Tablets with Atripla

(Efavirenz 600 mg/ Emtricitabine 200 mg/ Tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg, as fumarate) film-coated 
tablets’ of Bristol- Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences Limited, IDA Business & Technology Park, 
Carrigtohill, County Cork, Ireland. In the bioequivalence study, plasma levels of the Efavirenz, 
Tenofovir and Emtricitabine were measured and subjected to the confidence interval approach. 
This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, 
crossover fasting oral bioequivalence study of Mylan’s tenofovir disoproxil maleate, efavirenz and 
emtricitabine film-coated tablets, 300 mg/600 mg/200 mg and BMS/Gilead’s Atripla Film-coated 
Tablets, 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg in seventy-two (72) healthy, male and females (not of child-bearing 
potential) volunteers under fasting conditions. 
Since this was an open-label study, the randomization code was available to clinical staff for dosing, 
and to the statisticians and medical writers for report writing purposes. The randomization scheme was 
computer generated by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., and the subjects were randomized prior to Period I 
dose administration. 
This study was initiated with seventy-two (72) healthy adult subjects. Subjects checked into the 
clinical facility the evening prior to dosing. Check-in occurred at least 15 hours prior to dose 
administration for each study period. On study day 1, each subject received either a single oral dose (1 
x 300 mg/600 mg/200 mg tablet) of Mylan’s tenofovir disoproxil maleate, efavirenz and emtricitabine 
film-coated tablets, 300 mg/600 mg/200 mg, or a single oral dose (1 x 600 mg/200 mg/ 245 mg 
tablet) of BMS/Gilead’s Atripla Film-coated Tablets, 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg. Dosing occurred 
following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Following a 21-day washout period, subjects returned 
to the clinical facility to be dosed with the alternative treatment per the randomization schedule. 
During each study period, blood samples (1 x 10 mL) were collected in K2 EDTA tubes from each 
subject within 120 minutes prior to dose administration (0 hour) and post-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 
1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours. The subjects were 
allowed to leave the clinical facility after the 24 hour blood sample collection. They returned to the 
clinical facility for the scheduled blood sample collections at 36, 48, and 72 hours post-dose. 
Samples were assayed for efavirenz in the Bioanalytical Department of Mylan Laboratories Ltd. The 
method developed for the analysis of efavirenz in human plasma was performed using solid phase 
extraction and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. 
Samples were assayed for emtricitabine and tenofovir in the Bioanalytical Department of Mylan 
Laboratories Ltd. The assay for tenofovir was linear over the range of 5.006 to 600.743 ng/mL. The 
method developed for the analysis of emtricitabine and tenofovir in human plasma was performed 
using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometric detection. 
During the confinement study hours, when fluids were not restricted, subjects were allowed water ad 
lib. However, in general water consumption was controlled. No fluid, except that given with drug 
administration, was allowed from one hour prior to dose administration to one hour following dose 
administration. 
Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the study drug was administered with 240 mL of 
ambient temperature water. The subjects were instructed to swallow the tablet whole without 
breaking, sucking, chewing, crushing, or touching the tablet. Mouth and hand checks were performed 
to ensure drug ingestion. A fast was maintained for at least 4 hours after dosing. Water was allowed 
during fasting except when restricted as noted above.

At 4 and 10 hours after dose administration, standardized low-fat (i.e. ≤  20% of calories from fat) 
meals and beverages were served to subjects. All meals were free from grapefruit, xanthine-, and 
caffeine-containing products. Meals were identical during both study periods, and the percentage of 
meal consumed by each subject was recorded for each meal provided over the course of the study. 
During the first 4 hours after dose administration, subjects remained in an upright position and seated 
on hardback chairs, except for brief periods when subjects were permitted to leave their seats under 
close supervision (e.g., to use the restroom). 
Assuming a true ratio between 90%-111% and an intra-subject variability of 27%, a minimum of 
sixty-six (66) subjects was calculated to be required to conclude bioequivalence with approximately 
80% power. To account for subject withdrawal and dropouts due to adverse events, non-compliance or 
personal reasons, seventy-two (72) subjects were randomized and dosed. Subjects who failed to 
complete the study (drop-outs) were not replaced.

The subjects remained confined at the clinical facility until after the 24-hour blood sample collection. At 
36, 48 and 72 hours post-dose, the subjects returned to the clinical facility for scheduled blood sample 
collections. 
Most of the protocol violations were related to blood sample collection time deviations. The blood 
sample collection time point deviations should not have any impact on the outcome of the study as the 
actual blood sample collection times were utilized for pharmacokinetic analysis if the collection times 
were outside the protocol-defined window. 
Analytical methods 
The Applicant provided a bioanalytical report of the bioequivalence study including representative 
number of chromatograms and other raw data. Main characteristics of the method used (selectivity, 
lower limit of quantitation, calibration curve performance, accuracy, precision, stability) were validated 
before study and the validation criteria are met. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Statistical analyses were performed on the pharmacokinetic parameters using the General Linear 
Models Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The model tests for 
treatment effects in the parameter means at an alpha level of 0.05. The parameters TPEAK, KEL and 
HALFLIFE were analyzed statistically using the non-transformed data. The natural log transformed 
parameters LNAUCL, LNAUCINF, LNAUC72 and LNCPEAK were also be analyzed. Tests were performed 
to analyze for statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters and to determine 
the test to reference ratios of the pharmacokinetic parameters using Least Squares Means. Ninety 
(90%) percent confidence intervals were constructed using the two one-sided tests procedure.

Bioequivalence Criteria: 
The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of CPEAK, AUCL, and AUCINF for the test and 
reference product should be between 80% and 125% for the natural log-transformed data for 
emtricitabine and tenofovir. The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of CPEAK and pAUC72 
for the test and reference product should be between 80% and 125% for the natural log-transformed 
data for efavirenz. The PK variables were adequate. Standard methods were used. 
Statistical methods 
The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of CPEAK, AUCL, and AUCINF for the test and 
reference product should be between 80% and 125% for the natural log-transformed data for 
emtricitabine and tenofovir. 
The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of CPEAK and pAUC72 for the test and reference 
product should be between 80% and 125% for the natural log-transformed data for efavirenz. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir were calculated 
using non-compartmental techniques. Statistical analyses were performed on the pharmacokinetic 
parameters using the General Linear Models Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).

*ln-transformed values  
No pre-dose levels were detected for any of the analytes. tmax was never observed in any subject in 
the first sample time. Cmax was inside the validated range. For Efavirenz, truncated AUC at 72h was 
considered which is acceptable due to the long half-life of the drug. For Emtricitabine, extrapolated 
AUC was not higher than 20% in any subject. For Tenofovir, extrapolated AUC was higher than 20% in 
4 subjects (5 occasions).  
In this Single dose bioequivalence study, the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric means for log 
transformed primary PK parameters were within the accepted range of 80.00-125.00%, thus the rate 
and extent of absorption of the applicant’s Efavirenz/ Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil 600mg/ 
200mg/ 245mg Tablets are similar to the existing licensed product.

Safety data 
Neither death nor serious adverse event occurred during the study. Total 6 adverse events occurred in 
study out of them 4 adverse events were moderate in nature and 2 adverse events were mild in 
nature: 
For Test Product: Subject 8 had nausea in Period I. Subject 29 had pain in extremity in Period I. 
For Reference Product: Subject 12 had nausea in Period I. Subject 30 had headache in washout period. 
Subject 31 had constipation in Period I. Subject 34 had pain in extremity in Period I. 
The Applicant explained that the adverse events that occurred in the study are possibly related to the 
study products. These adverse events considered as the most common adverse events mentioned in 
the literatures.  
All physical examinations and all laboratory parameters were considered as normal by the investigator. 
Blood pressures, heart rate and ECG results were judged as normal (except Subject 02, 14, 25, 28 and 
34 for pre-study, Subject 02, 05, 14 and 29 for post-study for only ECG) by the investigator. 
The Applicant summarised that overall tolerability of the products found to be favourable. It was 
agreed that the medicines were generally safe and well tolerated by the subjects in the study 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is 
considered bioequivalent with Atripla.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The overview on clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety provided was considered adequate. To 
support this application the MAA a bioequivalence study was submitted and a statement that study 
complies with GCP principles was provided. 
All statistical analyses reveal that 90% confidence intervals are within the acceptable bioequivalent 
range of 80% and 125% for the natural log transformed parameters, LNAUCL, LNAUCINF and LNCPEAK 
for emtricitabine and tenofovir and for LNpAUC72 and LNCPEAK for efavirenz. This study demonstrates 
that Mylan’s tenofovir disoproxil maleate, efavirenz and emtricitabine tablets, 300 mg/600 mg/200 mg 
are bioequivalent to BMS/Gilead’s Atripla Film-coated Tablets, 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg following a 
single, oral dose of 300 mg/600 mg/200 mg (Mylan) or 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg (Atripla) administered 
under fasting conditions.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil film-
coated tablet. The reference product Atripla is indicated for treatment of human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA 
levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three 
months. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of 
the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; 
the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, 
two sequence, two-period crossover under fasting conditions design. The study design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the 
respective European requirements. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil Mylan met the protocol-
defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Atripla. The point estimates and their 
90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-, and Cmax were all contained within the 
protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is favourable in 
the following indication: 
“Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA 
levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three 
months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy 
and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant 
resistance to any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The demonstration of the benefit of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is primarily based on 
48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a 
Assessment report

Page 33/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combination antiretroviral therapy changed to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see 
section 5.1). No data are currently available from clinical studies with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients. 
No data are available to support the combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and 
other antiretroviral agents.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan are provided with a physician 
educational pack containing the following:  
 The Summary of Product Characteristics  
 HIV renal educational brochure, including the creatinine clearance slide ruler  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/630402/2017  
Page 34/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The HIV renal educational brochure should contain the following key messages:  
 That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV infected patients associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan  
 Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended for patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min)  
  That use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be avoided with concomitant 
or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely monitored according to 
the recommended schedule.  
 That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir disoproxil Mylan therapy 
  The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan therapy 
  Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of 
additional risk factors for renal impairment 
  If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance decreases during therapy to < 50 ml/min 
then renal function must be re-evaluated within one week. If creatinine clearance is confirmed as < 50 
ml/min or serum phosphate decreases to < 1.0 mg/dl then Efavirenz/Emtricitabine /tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan therapy should be interrupted. Interrupting treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine 
/tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function 
when no other cause has been identified.

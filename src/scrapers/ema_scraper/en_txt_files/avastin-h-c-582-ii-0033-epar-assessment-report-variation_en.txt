1.  Scope of the variation and changes to the dossier 
Scope of the variation: 
To extend the indication to the use of Avastin in 
combination with capecitabine for first-line 
treatment of patients with metastatic breast 
cancer in whom treatment with other 
chemotherapy options including taxanes or 
anthracyclines is not considered appropriate. 
Patients who have received taxane and 
anthracycline-containing regimens in the adjuvant 
setting within the last 12 months should be 
excluded from treatment with Avastin in 
combination with capecitabine. For further 
information about HER2 status, refer to section 
5.1.  
Consequently,  sections  4.1,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of 
the  SmPC  have  been  updated  to  reflect  the 
change in the indication accordingly. Finally Annex 
II has been updated in order to take into account 
the latest version of the RMP.

3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Breast  cancer 
is  the  most  common  cancer 
in  women  worldwide  and  the  highest  rate  
of occurrence is in Western Europe and North America. In 2002, an estimated 1.15 million new cases 
of breast cancer occurred globally, of which approximately 350,000 occurred in Europe and 230,000 in 
the US. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women with approximately 400,000 
deaths annually (Parkin et al, CA Cancer J Clin (2005), 55:74-108). For women who are not candidates 
for  hormonal  therapy  and  whose  tumours  are  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2)-
negative, cytotoxic chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for metastatic disease or locally recurrent 
disease  requiring  systemic  therapy  (Kataja  et  al,  Ann  Oncol  (2008),  19,  Suppl  2:ii1-ii13).  A  large 
number  of  cytotoxic  agents  have  demonstrated  activity  in  the  treatment  of  metastatic  breast  cancer 
(mBC), including anthracyclines, taxanes, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, and antimetabolites, such 
as  5-fluorouracil,  capecitabine,  or  methotrexate.  In  the  metastatic  setting  despite  the  variety  of 
chemotherapy agents available, patients are typically treated with palliative intent. 
No  single  regimen  has  emerged  as  a  sole  standard  of  care  that  can  be  applied  to  all  patients. 
Compared  with  single  agent  regimens,  combinations  of  cytotoxic  agents  may  provide  a  greater 
objective  response  rate  and  longer  progression-free  intervals  in  the  first-line  setting.  However,  those 
gains  come  at  the  expense  of  more  side  effects  and  overlapping  toxicity.  As  a  result,  the  use  of 
sequential single agent cytotoxic therapy remains a frequent approach.  
The introduction of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) in the 1990s has led to significant improvements 
in  the  management  of  mBC.  A  Cochrane  meta-analysis  of  randomized  trials  comparing  taxane-
containing  with  non-taxane-containing  chemotherapy  regimens  in  women  with  mBC  showed  that 
regimens containing taxanes improved overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and objective 
response  rates  (ORR)  (Ghersi  et  al,  Cochrane  Database  Syst  Review  (2005),  18(2):CD003366). 
Paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  share  similar  chemical  structures  and  anti-tumour  activities  but  differ  in 
haematological toxicity profiles (Verweij et al, Ann Oncol (1994), 5:495-505). 
Bevacizumab  (Avastin)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody.  It  inhibits  angiogenesis  by 
neutralizing  all  isoforms  of  human  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)-A  and  by  blocking  their 
binding to VEGF receptors. Bevacizumab was initially approved in the European Union (EU) on January 
12, 2005 for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum (mCRC) 
in  combination  with  intravenous  5-fluorouracil / folinic  acid  or  intravenous  5-fluorouracil / folinic 
acid / irinotecan.  
The  following  type  II  variations  were  subsequently  approved  in  the  EU  to  extend  the  use  of 
bevacizumab: (1) in combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of mBC (March 27, 2007), (2) 
in  combination  with  platinum  based  chemotherapy  for  first-line  treatment  of  unresectable  advanced 
metastatic  or  recurrent  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  other  than  predominantly  squamous  cell 
histology  (August  21,  2007),  (3)  in  combination  with  interferon  alfa-2a  for  first  line  treatment  of 
advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (December  14,  2007),    (4)  in  combination  with 
fluoropyrimidine-based  chemotherapy  for  treatment  of  mCRC  (January  25,  2008)  and  (5)  in 
combination with docetaxel for first-line treatment of mBC (July 23, 2009). 
This variation concerned an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin to include: 
‘‘Avastin  (bevacizumab)  with  standard  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of 
patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer.  For  further  information  as  to  HER2  status,  please  refer  to 
Section 5.1’’.  
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 5/55
 
 
 
A  revised  proposed  wording  for  the  requested  indication  has  been  presented  by  the  MAH  at  the  Oral 
Explanation as follows: 
’’Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  other  chemotherapy  options  are  not  preferred.  Patients  who  have 
received  taxane  and  anthracycline-containing  regimen  in  the  adjuvant  setting  within  the  last  12 
months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine. 
For  further  information  as  to  the  observed  differential  efficacy  depending  on  the  choice  of 
chemotherapy regimen and as to HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1’’. 
3.1.1 GCP aspects /Scientific Advice 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  primary  study  in  this  application,  AVF3694g  was  conducted  in  accordance 
with  current  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  Good  Clinical  Practices  (GCPs),  the 
International  Conference  on  Harmonization  (ICH)  E6  Guideline  for  GCP  and  national  and  local  ethical 
and legal requirements. 
3.2 Clinical aspects 
3.2.1 Clinical pharmacology 
No new PK/PD or interaction studies have been submitted with the current application.  
3.2.2 Clinical efficacy 
The data in the current application are mainly from a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled  phase  III  trial  (AVF3694g)  comparing  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  to 
placebo  and  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  mBC.  It  is  supported  by  data  from 
previously  submitted  phase  III  studies  E2100  and  BO17708  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with 
paclitaxel  and  docetaxel,  respectively,  as  first-line  treatment  for  patients  with  mBC.  An  earlier  phase 
III  study  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  in  patients  with  mBC  who  had  previously 
failed  therapy  with  anthracycline  and  a  taxane  (AVF2119g)  was  also  submitted.  All  studies  are 
presented in Table 1.

  Main study 
AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) Study 
AVF3694g is a phase III, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled study, designed to evaluate the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  combined  with  any  of  several  standard  cytotoxic  chemotherapies 
(two taxanes, four anthracycline-based therapies, or capecitabine). 
METHODS 
Study Participants

Treatments 
Eligible patients with locally recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast were randomized in 
a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  chemotherapy  plus  bevacizumab  [15 mg/kg  every  3  weeks  (q3w)]  or 
chemotherapy  plus  placebo  in  a  double-blind  fashion.  The  protocol  specified  three  chemotherapy 
options, from which the investigator chose one prior to randomization of each individual patient: 
1. Taxane: Either of the following taxanes administered intravenously every 3 weeks: 
Docetaxel 75-100 mg/m2  
Paclitaxel protein-bound particles (Abraxane) 260 mg/m2  
2.  Anthracycline-based  (for  patients  not  previously  treated  with  anthracyclines):  Any  of  the  following 
combinations, administered intravenously q3w for a maximum of 8 cycles: 
FEC:5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 90-100 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 on day 1 
FAC:5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 
AC:Doxorubicin 50-60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500-600 mg/m2  
EC:Epirubicin 90-100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500-600 mg/m2  
3. Capecitabine: 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle. 
The design of the study is presented in figure 1.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the clinical benefit of the addition of bevacizumab 
to standard chemotherapy regimens for previously untreated mBC. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  combined  with  any  of 
several  standard  cytotoxic  chemotherapies  (two  taxanes,  four  anthracycline-based  therapies,  or 
capecitabine). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  Progression  Free  Survival  (PFS)  based  on  investigator  assessment 
for  1)  patients  receiving  either  taxane  therapy  or  anthracycline-based  therapy  and  2)  patients 
receiving capecitabine therapy. 
PFS  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  to  time  of  first  documented  disease  progression  or 
death,  whichever  occurred  first.  Patients  without  an  event  were  censored  at  the  last  tumour 
assessment or last follow-up for disease progression at which they were known to be progression free. 
Patients without any post-baseline tumour assessment were censored at randomization.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints included  
  Objective  response  rate  (ORR):  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  as  assessed 
by  response  evaluation  criteria  in  solid  tumours  (RECIST)  determined  on  two  consecutive 
investigator assessments 4 weeks apart during first–line therapy. The primary analysis of OR 
was  based  on  patients  in  the  Intent-to  treat  (ITT)  population  with  measurable  disease  at 
baseline.

  Duration  of  objective  response  (DR):  the  time  from  date  of  objective  response  to  disease 
progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first.  Only  patients  who  were 
responders were included in the analysis of duration of response. 
  Overall  Survival:  the  time  from  randomization  until  death  from  any  cause.  For  patients  who 
had not died at the time of analysis or were lost to follow–up, data were censored at the date 
the patient was last known to be alive. This was the randomization date plus 1 day for patients 
who were randomized, not treated, and immediately lost to follow–up. 
  One–Year  Survival  Rate:  the  percentage  of  patients  who  were  alive  at  1  year  after  the 
randomization.  
 
Progression Free Survival Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed. 
Sample size 
Cohort 1 (Taxane or Anthracycline–Based Chemotherapy) 
The  sample  size  for  this  cohort  was  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  projected  enrolment  rate  of 
approximately 38 patients per month, a two–sided log–rank test and a 5% significance level. Based on 
these assumptions, a total of 600 patients (300 taxane treated patients and 300 treated anthracycline 
patients)  would  result  in  approximately  405 events  during  a  total  trial  period  of  approximately 
28 months.  This  allowed  for  approximately  90%  power  to  detect  an  improvement  in  median  time  to 
disease progression or death from 7 months in the chemotherapy  placebo arm to 10 months in the 
chemotherapy  bevacizumab arm [Hazard Ratio (HR)  0.70]. 
Cohort 2 (Capecitabine) 
Based  on  an  accrual  assumption  of  29 patients  recruited  per  month,  a  total  of  600 patients  would 
result in approximately 415 events during a total trial period of approximately 28 months. This allowed 
for  approximately  80%  power  to  detect  an  improvement  in  median  time  to  disease  progression  or 
death  from  6 months  in  the  placebo–containing  arm  to  8 months  in  the  bevacizumab–containing  arm 
(HR  0.75) at the 5% level of significance. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the bevacizumab-containing arm or the placebo-containing 
arm using the hierarchical dynamic randomization schema with the following stratification factors: 
 
 
choice of chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline-based, capecitabine), 
disease-free interval (≤ 12 months, > 12 months since completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, 
or  definitive surgery if no adjuvant chemotherapy, 
 
prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no),  
  number of metastatic sites (< 3, ≥ 3). 
Patients were to start their first dose of study treatment on the day of randomization but not later than 
5 working days after randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  included  a  double-blinded  treatment  phase  and  an  optional  open–label  post–progression 
phase  during  which  patients  were  followed–up  for  survival.  During  the  blinded  treatment  phase, 
patients received chemotherapy and bevacizumab or placebo every 3 weeks until disease progression, 
treatment limiting toxicity, or death due to any cause.

Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Both analysis cohorts were independently powered to detect a statistically significant increase in PFS at 
a type I error rate of 0.05 for each cohort. 
The analysis of PFS was formally tested using a stratified log–rank test at the two–sided   0.05 level. 
The stratification  factors  in  the  stratified  analyses  were  those  used  for  randomization:  disease–free 
interval (12 months, 12 months), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no), number of metastatic sites 
(3,  3),  and  choice  of  chemotherapy  (taxane,  anthracycline–based;  Cohort  1  only).  The  HR  was 
estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification variables as used in the 
stratified log–rank test.  
In  both  the  investigator  and  IRC–based  analysis,  for  those  patients  who  received  nonprotocol–
specified  antineoplastic  therapy  (NPT)  30 days  prior  to  investigator  or  IRC–determined  disease 
progression, PFS data were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment prior to the initiation 
of  NPT.  For patients  who  started  open–label  bevacizumab  prior  to  documented  disease  progression 
based  on  investigator  or  IRC  review,  data  were  censored  at  the last  tumour  assessment  prior  to 
initiation of open–label bevacizumab. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For  the  key  secondary  endpoints  of  ORR,  OS,  and 1–year  survival  rate,  the  following  test  procedures 
were used to maintain an overall type I error rate of   0.05 (two–sided):  
  Step 1: The secondary endpoint of ORR was tested at the type I error rate of 0.01.  
  Step 2a: If a statistically significant result was observed for ORR, OS was tested at the type I error 
rate of 0.05.  
  Step 2b: Otherwise, OS was tested at the type I error rate of 0.04. 
  Step  3:  One–year  survival  rate  was  compared  only  when  a  statistically  significant  result  was 
observed in OS between the two treatment arms. The type I error rate for 1–year survival rate was 
the same as that used for OS. 
No  adjustments  for  multiplicity  (of  endpoints  or  treatment  comparisons)  were  incorporated  into  the 
analyses of duration of objective response and PFS based on IRC–reviewed data. 
ORR was formally compared between the two treatment arms using the Cochran-MantelHaenszel test, 
stratified by the randomization stratification factors.  
OS was formally tested at the time of the final PFS analyses. This was considered as the final analysis 
of  OS.  A  stratified  log–rank  test  was  used  to  compare  the  OS  between  treatment  arms.  The  HR  was 
estimated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model.  
One–year survival rate for each treatment arm was estimated using the KaplanMeier method and the 
95%  confidence  intervals  using  Greenwood’s  formula.  The  difference  in  1–year  survival  rate  between 
treatment arms was assessed using the normal approximation method.  
PFS Based on IRC–Reviewed Data was analyzed as for the primary analysis of PFS.  
Three types of analysis populations were defined as follows: 
 
The  ITT  population,  defined  as  all  patients  who  were  randomized,  regardless  of  whether  they 
received any study drug or completed the full course of treatment. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 11/55
 
 
 
 
The  safety  evaluable  population  (SAP)  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one 
dose of study treatment. 
 
The post-progression SAP was all patients who received bevacizumab in the optional open-label 
post-progression phase.  
PFS Sensitivity Analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses were conducted for PFS:  
   Without  censoring  NPT:  For  patients  who  started  NPT  prior  to  progressive  disease,  any 
progression  or  death  occurring  after  initiation  of  NPT  was  considered  a  PFS  event.  Otherwise, 
PFS was censored at the last tumour assessments. 
   Early  discontinuation:  Initiation  of  NPT  prior  to  progressive  disease  or  death  or  discontinuation 
of  first–line  therapy  for  a  reason  other  than  progressive  disease  or  death  was  treated  as  an 
event.  The  time  of  event  was  the  last  tumour  assessment  prior  to  NPT  or  treatment 
discontinuation plus 1 day. 
   Missing tumour assessments: For patients with a PFS event who missed scheduled assessments 
or  had  assessments  that  were  deemed  “unable  to  assess”  immediately  prior  to  progressive 
disease, the date of progression was replaced by the date of the first missing assessment. 
     PFS on treatment: For patients who died or had disease progression 63 days after the last dose 
of  blinded  study  drug,  PFS  was  censored  at  the  last  tumour  assessment  within  63  days  (one 
tumour assessment cycle) after the last dose of blinded study drug. Data were censored at the 
last tumour assessment for patients who did not have disease progression or die. 
   Worst–case  analysis:  For  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow–up,  i.e.,  alive  without  any  tumour 
assessments  126  days  (two  tumour  assessment  cycles)  prior  to  the  clinical  data  cut–off, 
patients in the bevacizumab–containing arm were considered to have disease progression at the 
first  missing  tumour  assessment.  For  patients  in  the  placebo–arm  who  were  lost  to  follow–up, 
PFS was censored at the last available tumour assessment. 
The following post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed on the updated OS data to assess how the 
use of bevacizumab in the open–label phase may have affected OS. 
  Discounting OS for patients who received bevacizumab in the open-label phase 
Assuming  that  the  use  of  bevacizumab  in  the  open-label  phase  prolonged  OS,  the  survival  time  after 
the  initiation  of  bevacizumab  in  the  open-label  phase  was  discounted  by  25%  and  50%  for  both 
treatment arms.  
  Censoring OS at the initiation of bevacizumab use in the open-label phase 
This  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  treatment  effect  of  bevacizumab  on  OS, 
assuming that bevacizumab in the open-label phase was not available.  
     OS in patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab in the open label phase.  
OS was compared between treatment arms in patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab in the 
open-label phase.  
RESULTS 
Participant flow 
A total of 1237 patients (1232 female and 5 male) with locally recurrent or mBC were randomized to 
treatment with either Taxane/Anthracycline (T/Anth) + Bevacizumab (Bv) (N = 415), T/Anth + Placebo

(Pl)  (N  =  207),  Capecitabine  (Cap)  +  Bv  (N  =  409)  or  Cap  + Pl  (N  =  206).  In  the  taxane  subgroup, 
203 patients were enrolled in the T + Bv arm and 104 patients in the T  Pl arm. In the anthracycline–
based  chemotherapy  subgroup,  212  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  Anth   Bv  arm  and  103  patients  in 
the Anth  Pl arm. 
In Cohort 1, 36 patients (8.7%) in the T/Anth  Bv arm and 7 patients (3.4%) in the T/Anth  Pl arm 
remained on blinded study drug at the time of the clinical data cut–off for the final analyses (July 31, 
2008). In Cohort 2, 55 patients (13.4%) in the Cap  Bv arm and 22 patients (10.7%) in the Cap  Pl 
arm remained on blinded study drug at the time of the clinical data cut–off. The patient disposition is 
presented in Table 2.

Recruitment 
The study period was from 15 December 2005 to 31 July 2008. A total of 1237 patients were enrolled 
at 232 centres in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was finalized on 4 October 2005 and amended five times as follows: 
 
The first amendment to Study AVF3694g (effective on 1 February 2006) revised the protocol to 
provide  more  clarity  and  rigorous  guidelines  for  study  therapy  in  both  the  blinded  treatment 
and  optional  open-label  post-progression  phases.  Safety  information  was  updated  to  be 
consistent  with  current  standard  bevacizumab  dose  modification  guidelines.  Protocol-specified 
selected  adverse  events  and  special  reporting  for  non-serious  cardiac  adverse  events  were 
further  defined.  All  intracranial  haemorrhages  were  to  be  reported  as  serious  and  were 
therefore  subject  to  serious  adverse  event  reporting  requirements.  Safety  monitoring  of  left 
ventricular  function  during  initial  screening  was  added  for  patients  with  prior  exposure  to 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 13/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anthracycline-based  therapy,  rather  than  only  for  patients  entering  the  anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy subgroup. All Grade ≥ 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) events were 
to  be  reported  immediately  to  the  sponsor  to  allow  for  a  timely  and  thorough  review  of 
cardiotoxicity events by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
 
The  second  amendment  to  the  protocol  was  effective  on  22  November  2006.  Secondary 
objectives  and  outcome  measures  were  amended  to  include  1-year  survival  rate.  Additional 
changes  were  made  to  provide  more  clarity  and  rigorous  guidelines  for  study  therapy  during 
both  the  blinded  treatment  and  optional  open-label  post-progression  phases.  A  provision 
allowing  optional  unblinding  was  added  for  patients  with  documented  progressive  disease  if 
such information was believed to be instrumental in determining the next course of treatment.  
 
The third amendment to the protocol was effective on 20 February 2007. The amendment was 
triggered  by  the  FDA’s  comments  on  the  study  design.  Key  changes  to  the  protocol  included 
the  following:  The  sample  size  of  the  capecitabine  cohort  was  increased  to  fully  power  the 
capecitabine cohort in order to ascertain the clinical benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to 
capecitabine  therapy.  The  second  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  amended  in  order  to 
ascertain  the  clinical  benefit,  as  measured  by  PFS,  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to 
capecitabine therapy compared with capecitabine alone.  
 
In response to the FDA’s comments on Amendment 3, the protocol was amended a fourth time 
on 24 July 2007 to provide more information in support of the primary endpoint of PFS and the 
secondary  endpoint  of  overall  survival.  An  IRC  assessment  of  PFS  was  added  as  a  sensitivity 
analysis  to  provide  support  for  the  primary  endpoint  of  investigator-assessed  PFS.  Additional 
capture of subsequent anti-cancer therapy during the survival follow-up phase for all patients 
was  designed  to  provide  information  on  therapies  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  OS  of 
patients  after  they  had  discontinued  from  the  blinded  treatment  phase  of  the  study.  The 
definition  of  PFS  was  also  revised  to  allow  better  characterization  and  to  be  more  consistent 
with the definitions accepted by the regulatory communities.  
 
The  protocol  was  amended  a  fifth  time  on  27  March  2008.  The  optional  open-label  post-
progression  phase  was  extended  to  all  patients  receiving  study  treatment  when  the  study 
analysis  was  complete  if  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  showed  significant  improvement  with 
bevacizumab  without  a  detrimental  effect  on  patient  safety.  The  maximum  duration  of 
treatment with bevacizumab was increased to 48 months.

Supportive studies 
Studies  E2100,  BO17708  and  AVF2119G  are  supportive  studies.  Studies  E2100  and  BO17708  (Avado 
study)  formed  the  basis  for  the  approval  of  bevacizumab  in  mBC  in  combination  with  paclitaxel 
(EMEA/582/II/08)  and  docetaxel  (EMEA/582/II/24),  respectively.  In  the  3rd  RSI,  the  MAH  was 
specifically  asked  by  the  CHMP  to  present  supportive  data  on  the  bevacizumab-capecitabine 
combination based on study AVF3693g (Ribbon-2). 
Final analysis of OS in BO17708 has been submitted as part of the responses to the 2nd RfSI. However, 
the  assessment  of  these  data  was  deferred  to  the  Article  20  procedure  that  was  initiated  on  23 
September 2010. 
  AVF2119G 
This  was  a  randomised,  open-label  Phase  III  trial  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
capecitabine with or without bevacizumab, in women with mainly refractory/resistant mBC (previously 
exposed to anthracyclines and taxanes or with relapses < 12 months after adjuvant therapy).  
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  capecitabine  (2,500  mg/m2/d)  twice  daily  on  day  1 
through 14 every 3 weeks, alone or in combination with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1.  
The  primary  end  point  was  PFS,  as  determined  by  an  independent  review  facility  (IRF).  From 
November 2000 to March 2002, 462 patients were enrolled (230 patients in the capecitabine arm and 
232 in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm). 
Results in Study AVF2119G 
The  combination  of  capecitabine+bevacizumab  did  not  increase  PFS  as  determined  by  the  IRF.  The 
median  PFS  was  4.86  months  for  the  capecitabine+bevacizumab  arm  v.s.  4.17  for  the  bevacizumab 
arm (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]; P =0.857). 
The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in figure 4. 
Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of Progression-Free Survival: AVF2119G study 
The response rates results were 19.8% [95% CI, 14.7 to 25.0]  for the capecitabine/bevacizumab arm 
v.s.  9.1%  [95%  CI,  5.4  to  12.9]  for  the  bevacizumab  arm  (p  =  0.001)  as  determined  by  the  IRF 
review.

In Study AVF2119g, QoL data was collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast 
(FACT-B) instrument, which consists of 36 items from 5 subscales (physical well-being, functional well-
being,  emotional  well-being,  social  well-being,  breast  cancer  subscale).  FACT-B  was  administered  to 
patients every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks then every 9 weeks thereafter. The Trial Outcome Index-
Breast  (TOI-B),  which  includes  the  physical  well-being,  functional  well-being,  and  breast  cancer 
subscales  of  the  FACT-B  instrument,  was  pre-specified  as  the  primary  measure  of  QoL.  The  primary 
analysis of QoL was based on the time to deterioration in QoL (TDQ). TDQ is defined as the time from 
randomization  to  the  earliest  time-point  of  clinically  meaningful  decline  in  QoL  or  disease 
progression/death.  
No  significant  difference  was  observed  between  treatment  arms  in  TDQ,  based  on  the  other  six 
summary  scores  of  the  FACT-B  instrument  (FACT-B  total,  physical  well-being,  functional  well-being, 
emotional well-being, social well-being, breast cancer subscale).  
  AVF3693g (Ribbon-2) 
Study  AVF3693g  was  a  Phase III,  multicenter,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  trial 
designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  when  combined  with  standard 
chemotherapy  compared  with  chemotherapy  plus  placebo  in  patients  with  previously  treated  HER2-
negative  mBC.  All  patients  in  this  study  had  received  only  one  prior  line  of  therapy  for  metastatic 
disease.  The  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  prolongation  of  PFS  by  addition  of  bevacizumab  to 
any  of  four  commonly  used  second-line  mBC  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  treatment  options  in 
recurrent/metastatic  breast  cancer,  namely  taxanes,  gemcitabine,  capecitabine,  or  vinorelbine.  The 
dose  and  schedule  of  capecitabine  used  in  this  trial  was  the  generally  used  starting  dose  of 
1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on Days 1–14 of each 3 week cycle. 
In  Study  AVF3693g,  the  choice  of  chemotherapy  for  an  individual  patient  was  determined  at  the 
discretion of the individual investigator prior to randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 
AVF3693g was PFS based on investigator assessments, pooled across chemotherapy cohorts. Although 
no  chemotherapy  subgroup  was  individually  powered,  a  pre-specified  secondary  endpoint  was  PFS 
outcome by chemotherapy cohort. 
Results in Study AVF3693g 
The  stratified  HR  for  PFS  for  the  chemotherapy  +  bevacizumab  arm  relative  to  the  chemotherapy  + 
placebo  arm  (pooled,  ITT  analysis)  was  0.78  (p  =  0.0072),  representing  a  22%  risk  reduction  of 
disease progression or death with a delta at the median of 2.1 months (table 15).

  Biomarkers 
In  reply  to  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  has  performed  an  extensive  review  of  the  attempts  to  identify  a 
valid biomarker predictive of benefit from VEGF-targeted therapy.  
The  introduction  of  a  new  assay  to  measure  VEGF-A  levels  has  produced  highly  interesting  results 
compatible with relevant predictive value of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 as promising candidate markers with 
prognostic and predictive properties for bevacizumab. Further investigation of these markers and assay 
characterisation  will  be  performed  to  further  understand  these  data.  The  MAH  has  adequately 
described the steps taken in the development of the old and new ELISA assay, the availability of serum 
samples  from  all  finalised  and  ongoing  randomised  studies  for  the  reassessment  VEGF-A  levels  at 
baseline  and  on  treatment  as  well  as  the  timelines  for  the  submission  of  these  data  which  at  the 
earliest will be in Q1, 2011.

  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No  new  PK/PD  or  interaction  studies  have  been  submitted  with  the  current  application.  This  is 
acceptable as several former trials have investigated the interaction of bevacizumab with all the major 
groups of chemotherapies.  
The  protocol  of  AVF3694g  (Ribbon-1)  study  specified  three  chemotherapy  options,  from  which  the 
investigator  chose  one  prior  to  randomization  of  each  individual  patient.  The  selected  chemotherapy 
regimens represent the current standard of care in the first-line treatment of locally recurrent/mBC in 
the EU.  
The demographic data and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms.  
For  the  primary  endpoint  PFS  (investigator-assessed)  in  the taxane/anthracycline  cohort,  HR  was 
0.64 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80]; p<0.0001).   
The  CHMP  concluded  at  an  earlier  stage  of  the  procedure  that  the  gain  in  terms  of  PFS  in 
taxane/anthracycline  +  bevacizumab  treated  patients  was  overall  considered  of  modest  clinical 
significance.  Furthermore,  no  adjustment  for  multiplicity  was  incorporated  into  the  analysis  of  PFS 
based on IRC–reviewed data. Finally, no investigations of QoL had been included in the Ribbon-1 study 
submitted which was considered a shortcoming of the present application.  
As  a  consequence  to  major  objection  raised  by  the  CHMP,  an  indication  including  anthracycline  or 
Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel) was no longer requested.  
The data from the capecitabine cohort of the AVF3694g study showed a statistically significant effect 
of bevacizumab on PFS (median PFS of 8.6 months in the capecitabine+bevacizumab arm versus 5.7 
months in the capecitabine + placebo arm, respectively) with a stratified HR of 0.69 ([95% CI, 0.564 
to  0.840];  p=0.0002).    The  effect  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  capecitabine  on  PFS  over  time  is  not 
supported by a sustained OS advantage.  
No QoL data was collected in study AVF3694.  
In study AVF2119g the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine (as a 1st to 3rd line therapy following 
previous  treatment  with  anthracycline  and  a  taxane)  resulted  in  a  doubling  of  the  ORR  (19.8%) 
compared with patients treated with capecitabine alone (9.1%). However, the increased response rate 
was not associated with an improvement in PFS (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]) or in OS (HR=1.08 
[95%  CI,  0.80  to  1.45]).  Study  AVF2119g  enrolled  patients  who  were  more  heavily  pretreated  in  a 
more  advanced  stage  of  the  disease  or  patients  with  disease  characteristics  associated  with  a  poor 
prognosis.  
In  the  3rd  RSI,  the  MAH  was  specifically  asked  by  the  CHMP  to  present  supportive  data  on  the 
bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  based  on  study  AVF3693g  (Ribbon-2).  In  the  subgroup  of 
144  patients  (21%)  who  received  capecitabine  in  combination  with  either  bevacizumab  (n=  97)  or 
placebo  (n=47),  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  capecitabine  lead  to  a  median  PFS  of  6.9  months  in 
the  bevacizumab  arm  vs.  4.1  months  in  the  placebo  arm.  However,  no  statistical  significance  was 
reached. 
The SAG-O was consulted on the following question: 
 
The SAG-O should discuss the use, clinical relevance and benefit/risk balance of the bevacizumab 
+  capecitabine  combination  as  1st  line  treatment  in  patients  with  mBC  based  on  the  results  of 
cohort 2 of the AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) study and the supportive AVF2119g study (2nd line). 
The SAG agreed that in principle the effect observed in terms of PFS for bevacizumab + capecitabine 
(median 5.7 and 8.6 months for placebo + capecitabine and bevacizumab + capecitabine, respectively) 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 30/55
 
 
 
based on the AVF3694g trial was modest but clinically relevant for the same reasons listed above, and 
that the benefit-risk balance was positive. However, the SAG had different views about the strength of 
evidence  of  efficacy  of  the  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  due  to  inconsistencies  with  the 
results of study AVF2119g. 
According to one view, the evidence of clinical efficacy is convincing in the population studied. It should 
be noted that selection criteria for the pivotal AVF3694g trial excluded patients with prior adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  within  12  months.  This  group  of  patients  represents  a  population  with 
better  prognosis.  Therefore,  extrapolations  to  the  general  metastatic  breast  cancer  population  are 
difficult.  In  addition,  this  combination  appears  to  be  less  active  compared  to  a  number  of  available 
options including taxanes and should therefore only be used in case of clear preference for decreased 
toxicity at the expense of decreased antitumor activity, or in case of failure to taxanes in the adjuvant 
setting. Prescribing information should give clear instructions about the risk of decreased efficacy with 
this combination. Concerning the apparently inconsistent results of supportive study AVF2119g, these 
were  not  considered  of  concern  because  the  trial  was  conducted  in  a  more  advanced  setting  (second 
and third-line treatment). 
Other  SAG  members  questioned  the  consistency  of  the  efficacy  results  of  the  bevacizumab  + 
capecitabine  combination.  The  effect  on  PFS  associated  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with 
capecitabine  was  somewhere  in  between  the  effect  associated  with  bevacizumab  with  paclitaxel  and 
docetaxel and as such, the effect was convincing. However, the results of supportive study AVF2119g 
in  second  and  third-line  treatment  strongly  question  the  validity  of  this  observation.  Although  in  a 
different population (mainly refractory/resistant mBC previously exposed to anthracyclines and taxanes 
or with relapses < 12 months after adjuvant therapy), in this study the median PFS was 4.86 months 
for the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm v.s. 4.17 for the capecitabine arm (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 
1.25]; P =0.857). According to this view, the conflicting results in terms of PFS in trials AVF3694g and 
AVF2119g  have  not  been  sufficiently  explained.  Rather,  they  may  indicate  that  the  efficacy  has  been 
overestimated  in  trial  AVF3694g  and  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of  efficacy  for  bevacizumab  + 
capecitabine combination. Further data to confirm the efficacy of this combination should be provided 
before  a  positive  benefit-risk  balance  can  be  established  in  the  light  of  the  results  observed  in  study 
AVF2119g. Confirmation of efficacy is particularly important since this combination already appears to 
be less active compared to a number of available options including taxanes. 
A  revised  proposed  wording  for  the  requested  indication  has  been  presented  by  the  MAH  at  the  Oral 
Explanation as follows: 
’’Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  other  chemotherapy  options  are  not  preferred.  Patients  who  have 
received  taxane  and  anthracycline-containing  regimen  in  the  adjuvant  setting  within  the  last  12 
months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine. 
For  further  information  as  to  the  observed  differential  efficacy  depending  on  the  choice  of 
chemotherapy regimen and as to HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1’’.

  Adverse events of special interest 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
The incidences of ATEs were  2.0% between treatment arms. One event in the Cap+Pl arm led to the 
death of the patient. 
Bleeding 
Eleven  patients  (5.4%)  in  the  T+Bv  arm  experienced  15  grade  3  or  4  bleeding  events  compared  to 
none in the T+Pl arm. Nine of the events were GI haemorrhages, 4 events were epistaxis, and there 
was  one  event  each  of  post-procedural  haemorrhage  and  haematoma.  Bleeding  events  in  the  other 
two  chemotherapy  subgroups  were  uncommon  (incidence   0.5%).  The  only  grade  5  bleeding  event 
(haemothorax) was reported in the Cap+Pl arm. 
Febrile Neutropenia 
The  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  observed  in  the  T+Bv  arm  was  8.4%  vs.  2.0%  in  the  T+Pl  arm. 
Six  of  the  17  reported  events  in  the  T+Bv  arm  were  grade  4,  whereas  both  events  in  the  T+Pl  arm 
were  grade  3.  The  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  events  was  3.8%  in  the  Anth+Bv vs. 5.0%  in  the 
Anth+Pl  arm.  There  was  one  case  of  grade  5  febrile  neutropenia  in  the  Anth+Pl  arm.  No  febrile 
neutropenia events were reported in the capecitabine cohort. 
Fistula 
There were 4 reports of fistula during the trial, one in each of the taxane and capecitabine containing 
arms.  The  one  case  reported  in  the  T+Bv  arm  was  a  grade  5  abdominal  abscess.  No  fistula  events 
were reported in the anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup.  
Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation  
The  incidence  of  GI  perforations  was  2.5%  in  the  T+Bv  arm  vs.  1.0%  in  the  T+Pl  arm  (one  of  these 
events  in  the  T+Bv  arm  was  grade  4  and  one  grade  5).  There  were  no  GI  perforation  events  in  the 
anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup or in the capecitabine cohort.  
Hypertension 
The 
incidence  of  hypertension 
in 
the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with 
the 
placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane: 9.4% vs. 2.0%, 2) 
anthracycline: 10.5% vs. 0.0% and 3) capecitabine: 10.6% vs. 1.0%. Most AEs of hypertension were 
grade 3. In the Anth+Bv arm, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension was 16.2% in patients  65 
years of age vs. 8.7% in those < 65 years of age.  
Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD) 
Five  patients  (2.5%)  experienced  LVSD  in  the  T+Bv  arm  (four  grade 3  events  and  one  grade 2) 
compared  to  none  in  the  T+Pl  arm.  According  to  the  patient  narratives,  4  of  these  5  patients  had 
received previous adjuvant therapy with an anthracycline of the clinical study report. 
For patients who were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the cardiac adverse event rate 
was 6.2% in the Anth+Bv arm vs. 6.0% in the Anth+Pl arm. For patients who received anthracyclines 
concomitantly  with  bevacizumab,  the  incidence  of grade 3  or  higher  Congestive  Heart  Failure  (CHF) 
was 6 of 210 patients (2.9%) in the Anth+Bv arm vs. none of 100 patients in the Anth+Pl arm.  
The  incidence  of  LVSD  was  1.5%  in  the  Cap+Bv  arm  compared  and  0.5%  in  the  Cap+Pl  arm.  Two 
grade 5  cardiac  AEs  (cardiogenic  shock,  cardiac  failure/cardiorespiratory  arrest)  were  reported  in  the 
Cap+Bv arm.

Neutropenia 
The 
incidence  of  neutropenia 
in 
the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with 
the 
placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane: 9.4% vs. 4.9%, 2) 
anthracycline:  4.3%  vs.  4.0%  and  3)  capecitabine:  1.2%  vs.  1.0%.  One  grade  5  neutropenia  event 
was reported in the Anth+Pl arm.  
Proteinuria 
A  higher 
incidence  of  proteinuria,  especially  grade  3  proteinuria,  was  observed 
in 
the 
bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with  the  placebo-containing  arms  across  the  3  classes  of 
chemotherapy (T+Bv: 4.4%; Anth+Bv: 2.9%; Cap+Bv: 2.2%) compared to patients receiving placebo 
(0.0%).  
Overall,  a  higher  percentage  of  Abraxane-treated  patients  experienced  proteinuria  than  docetaxel-
treated  patients.  An  increase  in  the  incidence  of  proteinuria  was  observed  in  the  bevacizumab-
containing  arm  compared  with  the  placebo-containing  arm  for  both  subgroups  (Abraxane:  7.5%  vs. 
0.0%; docetaxel: 2.4% vs. 0.0%). 
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) 
One  patient  in  the  T+Bv  arm  (0.5%)  had  a  grade  3  RPLS  event.  No  RPLS  events  were  reported  in 
either the anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup or the capecitabine cohort.  
Sensory Neuropathy 
More  patients  in  the  taxane  subgroup  had  sensory  neuropathy  reported  than  in  the  anthracycline 
subgroup, although the incidence and grade of sensory neuropathy were similar across treatment arms 
with  each  subgroup  (Taxane  8%-9%:  anthracycline  0%-0.5%).  Most  cases  in  the  taxane  subgroup 
were  grade  3.  There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  grade   3  sensory  neuropathy  events  in  the  Cap+Bv 
arm relative to the Cap+Pl arm (3.0% vs. 0.5%).  
Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) 
The 
incidence  of  VTE  events 
in 
the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with 
the 
placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane : 4.9% vs. 2.0%, 2) 
anthracycline: 2.9% vs. 1.0% and 3) capecitabine 5.0% vs. 3.5% (most of the increase was in grade 3 
events).  Four  grade  5  VTE  events  (all  cases  of  pulmonary  embolism)  occurred  in  placebo  treated 
patients; one each in the T+Pl and Anth+Pl arm, and two in the Cap+Pl arm.  
Wound Dehiscence 
The incidence of wound dehiscence between the bevacizumab-containing and placebo-containing arms 
across the three chemotherapy regimens was: 1) taxane: 1.5% vs. 1.0%, 2) anthracycline: 1.0% vs. 
0.0% and 3) capecitabine: 0.7% vs. 0.0%). Most of the events were grade 3. 
  Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Serious  adverse  events  reported  during  the  blinded  treatment  phase  which  occurred  with  a  2% 
difference in incidence between treatment arms in any chemotherapy class are summarized in table 22.

As expected, the incidence of reported SAEs was higher in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared 
to  the  placebo-containing  arms:  1)  taxane  subgroup:  41.9%  vs.  26.5%,  2)  anthracycline-based 
subgroup:  22.9%  vs.  16.0%  and  3)  capecitabine  cohort:  25.2%  vs.  20.4%.  The  only  individual  SAE 
occurring  at  a  >5%  higher  incidence  in  patients  treated  with  bevacizumab  was  febrile  neutropenia 
(7.4% in the T+Bv arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm). SAEs with a 2% but <5% higher incidence in 
T+Bv patients compared to T+Pl were diarrhoea (3.0% vs. 0%), sepsis (3.0% vs. 1.0%), dehydration 
(3.0%  vs.  1.0%),  GI  perforation  (2.0%  vs.  0%),  and  cellulitis  (2.5%  vs.  0%).  In  patients  receiving 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  febrile  neutropenia  was  the  only  SAE  which  occurred  with  a  2% 
incidence in Anth+Bv (3.3%) and Anth+Pl patients (5.0%). In the capecitabine cohort, there were no 
SAEs with a 2% higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab or placebo.

The most common cause of death in all treatments arms was disease progression which accounted for 
91%  of  all  deaths.  Approximately  10%  of  deaths  occurred  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  of  blinded 
study  drug.  Of  these  deaths,  60%  were  due  to  investigator-reported  disease  progression;  the

remaining  deaths  were  due  to  an  adverse  event.  None  of  the  deaths  from  causes  other  than  disease 
progression were attributed to study drug by the investigators.

Laboratory  tests  for  safety  were  not  performed  in  study  AVF3694g  with  the  exception  of  screening 
laboratory values and urine protein/creatinine ratio.  
For  patients  who  were  treated  with  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  the  mean  left  ventricular 
ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  decreased  slightly.  The  decline  in  LVEF  in  the  two  treatment  arms  was:  1) 
Anth+Bv arm baseline vs. highest postbaseline value: 65.7% vs. 59.6% and 2) Anth+Pl arm baseline 
vs. highest postbaseline value: 64.7% vs. 60.8%. There were no other notable findings in the analyses 
of vital signs.

  Safety in special populations 
Adverse events by age group 
In general, elderly patients ( 65 years old) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 3 adverse events 
compared  with  younger  patients,  regardless  of  treatment  arm.  Consistent  with  what  was  reported  in 
the overall study population, the incidence of adverse events in the bevacizumab–containing arm was 
higher than that in the placebo–containing arm for each subgroup across chemotherapy classes.  
Adverse Events by Age Group in Patients Receiving Capecitabine Therapy 
Adverse  events  with  a  2%  difference  in  incidence  between  treatment  arms  and  more  than 
one occurrence  in  each  subgroup  are  summarised  for  patients  treated  with  capecitabine  therapy  in 
table 25. 
Of the 605 patients who received capecitabine therapy, 150 (24.8%) were 65 years old. Hypertension 
was the only adverse event with a 5% incidence in either subgroup. Adverse events with a 2% but 
<5% difference in incidence between treatment arms and more than one occurrence per subgroup, but 
not  meeting  these  criteria  in  the  overall  population  were  diarrhoea,  mucosal  inflammation,  pain, 
asthenia,  sepsis,  hip  fracture,  dehydration,  mental  status  change,  pleural  effusion,  pulmonary 
embolism and palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome.

 
Post marketing experience 
No data was submitted. 
  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in Bv-treated arms than in the placebo-containing 
arms across all 3 chemotherapy regimens.  
In Cap-treated patients, hypertension was the only AE with 5% increase in incidence in the Cap + Bv 
arm  versus  the  Cap  +  Pl  arm.  Adverse  events  with  a  2%  but  5%  difference  in  incidence  between 
treatment arms were peripheral sensory neuropathy, and proteinuria.  
Among patients with AEs, patients with Grade 3-5 events were quite frequent, particularly in the T+Bv 
arm (57.1%). 
The  addition of  Bv  to  the  3  different  chemotherapy  backbones  resulted  in  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs 
compared to the Pl-containing arms: T: 41.9% (Bv) vs. 26.5% (Pl), Anth: 22.9% (Bv) vs. 16.0% (Pl), 
Cap: 25.2% (Bv) vs. 20.4% (Pl).  
A higher incidence of hypertension was observed in all the bevacizumab-containing arms compared to 
the placebo-containing arms across the 3 chemotherapy regimens (T: 9.4% vs. 2.0%; Anth: 10.5% vs. 
0.0%; Cap: 10.6% vs. 1.0%). Most adverse events of hypertension were grade 3. Likewise, a higher 
incidence  of  proteinuria,  especially  grade  3  proteinuria,  was  observed  in  the  bevacizumab-containing 
arms compared with the placebo-containing arms across the 3 classes of chemotherapy (T+Bv: 4.4% 
(highest  in  Abraxane-treated  patients);  Anth+Bv:  2.9%;  Cap+Bv:  2.2%)  compared  to  patients 
receiving placebo (0.0%). For patients who were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the 
cardiac  adverse  event  rate  was  similar  across  treatment  arms  (Anth+Bv:  6.2%  vs.;  Anth+Pl:  6.0%). 
However, more patients had a higher grade of LVSD in the Anth+Bv arm compared with the Anth+Pl 
arm. In addition, an independent and blinded cardiologist has re-evaluated these events and concluded 
that only 2 patients had true evidence of severe treatment-related CHF.

A  higher  proportion  of  T/Bv  and  T/Anth-treated  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AEs 
compared to their respective Pl-containing arms : T : 25.1% (Bv) vs. 8.8% (Pl), Anth : 15.2% (Bv) vs. 
4.0%  (Pl),  Cap :  12.6%  (Bev)  vs.  11.9%  (Pl).  The  most  common  events  leading  to  discontinuations 
were GI perforations, proteinuria and hypertension.  
The  most  common  AEs  related  to  the  treatment  of  bevacizumab  are  hypertension  and  proteinuria. 
Much  attention  is  being  put  on  severe,  bevacizumab-associated  events  like  high  grade  bleeding, 
arterial  thromboembolic  events,  GI  perforation  and  wound-healing  complications.  These  events  occur 
at low incidence. Overall, the safety profile of bevacizumab in mBC seems consistent with our previous 
experience  in  other  indications.  Finally,  no  difference  in  toxicity-related  mortality  has  been  observed 
between treatment arms.

activities 
Routine. 
EU SmPC section 4.4: 
Haemorrhage 
Patients treated with Avastin 
have an increased risk of 
haemorrhage, especially 
tumour-associated 
haemorrhage. Avastin should be 
discontinued permanently in 
patients who experience Grade 3 
or 4 bleeding during Avastin 
therapy. Patients with untreated 
CNS metastases were routinely 
excluded from clinical trials with 
Avastin, based on imaging 
procedures or signs and 
symptoms. Therefore, the risk of 
CNS haemorrhage in such 
patients has not been 
prospectively evaluated in 
randomised clinical studies. 
Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of CNS 
bleeding, and Avastin treatment 
discontinued in case of 
intracranial bleeding. There is no 
information on the safety profile 
of Avastin in patients with 
congenital bleeding diathesis, 
acquired coagulopathy or in 
patients receiving full dose of 
anticoagulants for the treatment 
of thromboembolism prior to 
starting Avastin treatment, as 
such patients were excluded 
from clinical trials. Therefore,

In five randomised clinical trials, 
the incidence of arterial

infarctions (MIs) was higher in 
patients receiving Avastin in 
combination with chemotherapy 
compared to those who received 
chemotherapy alone. Patients, 
receiving Avastin plus 
chemotherapy, with a history of 
arterial thromboembolism or age 
greater than 65 years have an 
increased risk of developing 
arterial thromboembolic events 
during therapy.  
Caution should be taken when 
treating these patients with

of incidence and reversibility 
EU SmPC section 4.4:  
An increased incidence of 
hypertension was observed in 
Avastin-treated patients. Clinical 
safety data suggest that the 
incidence of hypertension is 
likely to be dose-dependent. Pre 
existing hypertension should be 
adequately controlled before 
starting Avastin treatment. 
There is no information on the 
effect of Avastin in patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension at the 
time of initiating therapy. 
Monitoring of blood pressure is 
generally recommended during 
therapy. In most cases 
hypertension was controlled 
adequately using standard 
antihypertensive treatment 
appropriate for the individual 
situation of the affected patient. 
The use of diuretics to manage 
hypertension is not advised in 
patients who receive a cisplatin-
based chemotherapy regimen. 
Avastin should be permanently 
discontinued, if medically 
significant hypertension cannot 
be adequately controlled with 
antihypertensive therapy, or if 
the patient develops 
hypertensive crisis or 
hypertensive encephalopathy.

4.  Benefit Risk Assessment 
Benefits  
The data from the capecitabine cohort of the AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) study resulted in 2.9 months gain 
in median PFS (8.6 months in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm compared with 5.7 months in the 
capecitabine-placebo arm). The HR was 0.69 ([95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84]; log rank p=0.0002). In support 
of the primary analysis, the ORR was 35.4% in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm vs. 23.6% in the 
capecitabine + placebo arm (p=0.0097). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  the  more  heavily  pretreated  patient  population  in  supportive  study  AVF2119g,  the  increased  ORR 
was  not  associated  with  an  improvement  in  PFS  (HR=0.98  [95%  CI,  0.77  to  1.25])  or  OS  (HR=1.08 
[95%  CI,  0.80  to  1.45])  which  may  reflect  the  increasing  degree  of  tumour  resistance  that  develops 
over time with the successive lines of therapy. 
No  statistical  significance  was  reached  in  the  PFS  results  of  study  AVF3693g  (Ribbon-2)  .In  addition, 
the  ORR  was  35.8%  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  vs.  15.4%  in  the  control  arm  (p=0.0225)  but  no 
statistically significant.

No formal comparison with other standard available first line therapeutic options are made neither the 
patient population which may eventually benefit from first line capecitabine has been clearly defined. 
Risks  
The  safety  profiles  of  both  capecitabine  as  well  as  bevacizumab  have  been  well-characterized.                    
Common  AEs  associated  with  capecitabine  include  gastrointestinal  disorders,  hand-foot  syndrome, 
fatigue,  asthenia,  anorexia,  cardiotoxicity,  increased  renal  dysfunction  in  patients  with  pre-existing 
renal insufficiency and thromboembolism. The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine has not lead to 
new safety concerns.  
The  overall  incidence  of  reported  AEs  was  higher  in  the  combination  arm  (40.1%)  compared  to  the 
placebo arm (26.9%). Particularly, the incidences of hypertension, peripheral sensory neuropathy and 
proteinuria  were  increased.  There  were  no  SAEs  with  a  ≥  2%  difference  in  incidence  between 
treatment arms. The percentage of deaths unrelated to disease progression was 2.5% in the placebo-
containing arm vs. 1.5% in the bevacizumab-containing arm.  
Concerning  the  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination,  the  proportion  of  patients  experiencing 
grade 3-5 adverse events was 37% versus 23% associated with capecitabine + placebo. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  claimed  improvement  in  PFS  associated  with  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine 
compared  to  capecitabine  alone  based  on  the  AVF3694g  trial  was  modest  and  no  important  effects 
have been observed in terms of other clinically relevant endpoints such as OS or health-related quality 
of life. No important effects were observed in terms of clinical efficacy in study AVF2119g in a relevant 
patient population.  
The  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity.  This  is  of 
particular  relevance  since  the  proposed  indication  is  aimed  at  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  for  whom  a  more  tolerable  regimen  is  preferred  compared  to  more  active 
chemotherapy.  
In  the  absence  of  an  established  clinical  efficacy  or  other  clinically  relevant  benefits,  and  considering 
the  significant  toxicity  of  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine,  the  benefit-risk  cannot  be 
considered positive in the proposed indication. 
Recommendation 
On 16 December the CHMP considered this Type II variation and agreed that the changes to the terms 
of the Marketing Authorisation should be refused on the following grounds: 
 
The  claimed  improvement  in  PFS  associated  with  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine 
compared to capecitabine alone based on the AVF3694g trial was modest and no important effects 
have  been  observed  in  terms  of  other  clinically  relevant  endpoints  such  as  OS  or  health-related 
quality of life.  
  No  important  effects  were  observed  in  terms  of  clinical  efficacy  in  study  AVF2119g  in  a  relevant 
patient population.  
 
The  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity.  This  is  of 
particular  relevance  since  the  proposed  indication is  aimed  at  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
metastatic breast cancer for whom a more tolerable regimen is preferred compared to more active 
chemotherapy.

risk cannot be considered positive in the proposed indication. 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 16 December 2011 
Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  benefit-risk  for  Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  for 
first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom other chemotherapy options are 
not  preferred,  could  not  be  considered  positive,  the  MAH  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the 
re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the MAH 
The MAH presented in writing and at an oral explanation a number of arguments regarding the grounds 
for refusal: 
Ground No 1 
The  MAH  argued  that  in  Study  AVF3694g,  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  has 
demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically relevant, and robust improvement in PFS, which was 
supported by a superior ORR as well as by a numerical improvement in OS:  
  Capecitabine  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  was  superior  to  capecitabine  alone,  with  a 
clinically meaningful improvement in PFS (stratified HR 0.69, log-rank p=0.0002; median PFS 
8.6  vs.  5.7  months,  a  2.9  month  improvement  in  the  median  PFS),  corresponding  to  a 
reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death  by  31%.  These  data  were  corroborated  by  a 
blinded independent review committee (HR 0.68; median PFS 9.8 vs. 6.2 months, a 3.6 month 
improvement in the median PFS). 
 
Improvements  in  PFS  were  seen  across  all  prognostic  categories  and  patient  subgroups, 
including patients who had received anthracyclines and/or taxanes for early breast cancer. 
  Multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the primary PFS analysis. 
 
The  clinical  benefit  was  supported  by  a  superior  ORR  for  capecitabine  +  bevacizumab  treated 
patients  compared  with  those  treated  with  capecitabine +  placebo  (35.4%  vs.  23.6%).  The 
incidence of PD as best OR, an indication of the ineffectiveness of treatment, was lower in the 
combination arm (14.8% vs. 27.3%). 
  OS  numerically  favoured  the  bevacizumab-containing  arm,  as  measured  by  both  the  hazard 
ratio 
(HR 0.88;  95%  CI 
[0.69 
to  1.13])  and 
the  medians 
(capecitabine + 
placebo: 22.8 months, capecitabine + bevacizumab: 25.7 months). 
o  Overall more patients who received bevacizumab were alive at 1 year (1-year survival: 
81.0%) than with chemotherapy alone (1-year survival: 74.8%). 
o  There was no increase in treatment-related deaths or deaths overall in women treated 
with capecitabine + bevacizumab versus capecitabine + placebo. 
o  Sensitivity analyses have shown that the 62% crossover of control arm patients in this 
study could have had the effect of appreciably diluting the magnitude of the OS benefit 
that might have been observed in the absence of crossover. 
Ground No 2 
The MAH disagreed with the ground of refusal No 2 for the following reasons: 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 48/55
 
 
 
 
 
In  contrast  to  the  capecitabine  cohort  in  the  first-line  Study  AVF3694g,  Study  AVF2119g 
enrolled  a  heterogeneous  population  of  patients  with  more  advanced  chemotherapy-resistant 
or refractory disease in the first to third-line and later line setting. 
 
The refractory nature of the population of patients enrolled in Study AVF2119g was reflected in 
the inadequate response to capecitabine alone, as shown by the low objective response rate. 
  Given  the  substantial  differences  in  the  patient  populations  enrolled  in  studies  AVF2119g  and 
AVF3694g, it is not considered appropriate to compare the efficacy results of the two trials. 
 
It  is  more  appropriate  to  make  a  comparison  to  Study  AVF3693g  which  indicated  that  the 
combination  of  bevacizumab  and  capecitabine  is  efficacious  as  second-line  treatment  of 
patients with mBC. 
Ground No 3 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  in  study 
AVF3694g was generally consistent with the well-established profile observed in the more than 90,000 
women who have been treated with bevacizumab worldwide for mBC, and as described in the currently 
approved Avastin SmPC: 
 
The  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  capecitabine  does  not  add  unexpected  toxicities  in  patients 
with  previously  untreated  mBC.  The  most  common  adverse  events  observed  in  the 
capecitabine  +  bevacizumab  arm  were  hypertension,  proteinuria,  and  sensory  neuropathy. 
(Note: palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), a common side effect associated with the use 
of capecitabine, was most likely reported as sensory neuropathy in this study). 
 
The  incidence  of  hypertension  was,  as  expected,  higher  in  the  capecitabine  +  bevacizumab 
arm.  The  maximum  grade  of  hypertension  observed  in  this  study  was  Grade  3  and 
characterized  as  asymptomatic,  manageable  with  routine  clinical  intervention  and  allowed 
continuation of bevacizumab and capecitabine administration. 
  Severe  safety  events  known  to  be  associated  with  bevacizumab  were  either  not  observed 
(gastrointestinal  perforation),  or  occurred  at  a  low  incidence  and  at  a  rate  similar  to  the 
capecitabine  +  placebo  arm  (arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATE):  2.0%  vs.  1.5%,  venous 
thromboembolic  events  (VTE):  5.0%  vs.  3.5%)  and  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of 
bevacizumab. 
  Adverse  events  that  are  common  to  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  such  as  haematological  toxicity 
or  alopecia  were  infrequently  or  not  observed  in  patients  who  were  randomized  to  the 
capecitabine cohort of AVF3694g. 
 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  was  similar  in  both 
treatment  arms,  and  the  incidence  of  discontinuation  due  to  hypertension  or  proteinuria  was 
very low. 
 
The overall number of deaths was lower in the bevacizumab-containing arm and there was no 
increase in treatment-related deaths with bevacizumab treatment. 
In conclusion, the combination of bevacizumab and capecitabine was generally well tolerated as first-
line  treatment  for  patients  with  mBC.  The  study  population  comprised  approximately  40%  of 
anthracycline and taxane adjuvant pre-treated patients; a patient population where treatment choice is 
driven  primarily  by  efficacy  considerations,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  assertion  of  the  CHMP  that 
capecitabine  treatment  is  primarily  for  a  patient  population  for  whom  a  more  tolerable  regimen  is 
preferred. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 49/55
 
 
 
Ground No 4 
The choice of chemotherapy to use in patients as first-line treatment for mBC is based upon multiple 
clinical,  biologic,  and  patient-specific  factors.  These  factors  include  disease,  hormone  and  HER2 
receptor  status,  the  patient’s  disease-free  interval  from  adjuvant  treatment,  type  of  prior  treatment 
and presence of residual toxicity from previous therapy, sites of disease, pace of disease progression, 
presence  or  absence  of  symptoms,  treatment  priority,  anticipated  tolerance  to  treatment,  and  co-
morbid conditions that would dictate choice of treatment and last but not least patient’s preference.  
Among the many chemotherapy agents available, capecitabine is an attractive option for patients given 
its ease of administration via the oral route, lack of alopecia, manageable and reversible toxicities, and 
infrequent  myelosuppression.  Because  of  its  proven  efficacy  and  safety  profile,  capecitabine  is 
considered  appropriate  in  particular  for  patients  who  have  received  both  anthracycline  and  taxane 
based  chemotherapy  for  early  breast  cancer,  patients  with  slowly  growing  progressive  disease,  those 
who  prefer  oral  chemotherapy  treatment,  patients  who  elect  to  avoid  alopecia,  those  who  cannot 
tolerate  myelosuppressive  treatment  or  are  intolerant  of  cumulative  toxicity  and  elderly  patients  or 
those who are less fit. 
From  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  data  presented  above,  the  MAH  is  of  viewpoint  that  the  clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS supported by an improvement of basically 
all efficacy parameters together with a well-characterized and manageable safety profile supports the 
positive  benefit-risk  balance  for  the  combination  of  bevacizumab  with  capecitabine  as  an  important 
treatment option for patients in the first-line mBC setting. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The  CHMP  opinion  remained  negative  regarding  the  previous  proposed  indication  for  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  other  chemotherapy  options  are  “not 
preferred”.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  indication  should  be  more  rigorously  defined  since  preference  alone  is 
not informative in guiding patient selection and does not necessarily identify patients for whom other 
treatment options including taxanes and anthracyclines are not available. The CHMP maintained that in 
a  population  where  patient  characteristics  allowed  treatment  options  including  taxanes  and 
anthracyclines, the benefit-risk of bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination could not be considered 
positive. 
However,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  population  in  whom  treatment  with  other 
chemotherapy  options  including  taxanes  or  anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate.  The  CHMP 
considered  that  capecitabine  was  an  acceptable  treatment  choice  and  comparator  in  the  subgroup  of 
patients who are not candidates for more aggressive chemotherapy including taxanes or anthracyclines. 
Such  patients  include  those  who  may  have  received  anthracyclines  and  taxanes  in  the  adjuvant 
treatment  setting,  who  are  unlikely  to  tolerate  myelosuppressive  treatment,  or  who  are  intolerant  of 
cumulative toxicity, elderly patients, or patients with slow-growing disease. Based on this and the data 
provided, the CHMP agreed that it can be concluded that a clear effect in terms of PFS is seen with the 
addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine.   
Therefore  the  indication  was  amended  to  exclude  patients  eligible  for  treatment  including  taxanes  or 
anthracyclines,  as  follows:  ‘‘Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  treatment  with  other  chemotherapy 
options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443982/2011  
Page 50/55
 
 
 
 
 
taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should 
be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine’’.  
The CHMP discussed the clinical relevance of the 2.9 months difference observed in median PFS in this 
population in AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) trial. The CHMP concluded that this difference was still modest but 
that  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  effect  needs  to  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  the  benefit-risk 
evaluation  in  this  population  for  which  there  are  limited  alternative  treatment  options.  In  terms  of 
other clinically relevant endpoints, the CHMP acknowledged that a detrimental effect in terms of overall 
survival was unlikely.  
The  single  pivotal  trial  AVF3694g  (Ribbon-1)  conducted  was  sufficiently  robust  to  allow  drawing 
meaningful  conclusions  in  the  revised  proposed  indication.  In  particular,  the  effect  observed  for 
bevacizumab+capecitabine  was  considered  to  be  consistent  across  subgroups  and  robust  to  different 
assumptions  explored  in  sensitivity  analyses.  The CHMP  agreed  that  the  lack  of  supportive  data  from 
study AVF2119g due to the more advanced population included (second and third-line treatment) was 
no longer considered as a major pitfall in view of the robustness of the pivotal trial and the clear effect 
seen in terms of PFS.  
The  overall  incidence  of  reported  AEs  was  higher  in  the  combination  arm  (40.1%)  compared  to  the 
placebo arm (26.9%). Particularly, the incidences of hypertension, peripheral sensory neuropathy and 
proteinuria  were  increased.  However,  there  were  no  major  differences  between  treatment  groups  in 
terms  of  SAEs  or  deaths  unrelated  to  disease  progression.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  despite  the 
toxicity  associated  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  significant,  it  is  outweighed 
by  a  sufficient  clinical  relevance  in  terms  of  PFS  for  this  restricted  population  and  therefore  its 
acceptability has to be assessed in the context of the benefit-risk balance for this restricted population.  
Patients with metastatic breast cancer  in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including 
taxanes  or  anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate  have  limited  therapeutic  options.  In  this 
population,  the  modest  effect  observed  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  may  be 
considered  of  sufficient  clinical  relevance  as  it  is  expected  to  be  associated  with  benefits  in  terms  of 
symptom  control.  Although  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  resulted  in  increased  toxicity,  this  was  not 
considered  a  major  concern  in  view  of  the  clinically  relevant  effect  in  this  population  with  limited 
alternative  treatment  options.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  in  the  indication  of  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  treatment  with  other  chemotherapy  options  including  taxanes  or 
anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate  the  grounds  for  negative  opinion  no  longer  hold.  The 
CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  as 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer,  in  whom  treatment  with  other 
chemotherapy options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not considered appropriate, is considered 
positive.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8) 
Events  consistent  with  CHF  were  reported  in  clinical  trials.  The  symptoms  findings  ranged  from 
asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or 
hospitalisation.  Caution  should  be  exercised  when  treating  patients  with  clinically  significant 
cardiovascular  disease  such  as  pre-existing  coronary  artery  disease,  or  congestive  heart  failure  with 
Avastin. 
Most  of  the  patients  who  experienced  CHF  had  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  had  received  previous 
treatment  with  anthracyclines,  prior  radiotherapy  to  the  left  chest  wall  or  other  risk  factors  for  CHF, 
such as pre-existing coronary heart disease or concomitant cardiotoxic therapy were present. 
In  patients  in  AVF3694g  who  received  treatment  with  anthracyclines  and  who  had  not  received 
anthracyclines  before,  no  increased  incidence  of  all  grade  CHF  was  observed  in  the  anthracycline  + 
bevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF grade 3 or higher events 
were  somewhat  more  frequent  among  patients  receiving  bevacizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients 
in  other  studies  of  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  did  not  receive  concurrent  anthracycline  treatment 
(see section 4.8). 
Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease or 
pre-existing congestive heart failure with Avastin.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
In  clinical  trials  with  Avastin,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF)  was  observed  in  all  cancer  indications 
studied  to  date,  but  occurred  predominantly  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer.  In  two  four 
phase  III  trials  (AVF2119g,  and  E2100,  BO17708  and  AVF3694g)  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast 
cancer an increase of CHF Grade 3 or more higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with 
Avastin  was  seen  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  compared  with  up  to  0.9%  in  the  control  arms. 
For  patients in  study  AVF3694g  who  received  anthracyclines  concomitantly  with  bevacizumab,  the 
incidences of grade  3 or  higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to 
those in the other studies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm 
and 0% in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all grade 
CHF  were  similar  between  the  anthracycline  +  Avastin  (6.2%)  and  the  anthracycline  +  placebo  arms 
(6.0%). 
Most patients of these who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left 
ventricular function following appropriate medical therapy.

Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) 
Two large Phase III trials were designed to investigate the treatment effect of Avastin in combination 
with  two  individual  chemotherapy  agents,  as  measured  by  the  primary  endpoint  of  PFS.    A  clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in both trials.

AVF3694g 
Study  AVF3694g  was  a  Phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trial  designed  to 
evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Avastin  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  compared  to 
chemotherapy plus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic or locally 
recurrent breast cancer.  
Chemotherapy  was  chosen  at  the  investigator's  discretion  prior  to  randomization  in  a  2:1  ratio  to 
receive  either  chemotherapy  plus  (cid:31)Avastin  or  chemotherapy plus(cid:31) placebo.  The  choices  of 
chemotherapy included capecitabine, taxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel), and anthracycline-
based  agents 
(doxorubicin/  cyclophosphamide,  epirubicin/  cyclophosphamide,  5-fluorouracil/ 
doxorubicin/  cyclophosphamide,  5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide)  given  every  three  weeks 
(q3w). Avastin or placebo was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w. 
This  study  included  a  blinded  treatment  phase,  an  optional  open-label  post-progression  phase,  and a 
survival  follow-up  phase.  During  the  blinded  treatment  phase,  patients  received  chemotherapy  and 
study drug (Avastin or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment-limiting toxicity, or 
death. On documented disease progression, patients who entered the optional open-label phase could 
receive open-label Avastin together with a wide-range of second line therapies. 
Statistical  analyses  were  performed  independently  for  1)  patients  who  received  capecitabine  in 
combination  with  Avastin  or  placebo;  2)  patients  who  received  taxane-based  or  anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy in combination with Avastin or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS by 
investigator  assessment.  In  addition,  the  primary  endpoint  was  also  assessed  by  an  independent 
review committee (IRC).  
The  results  of  this  study  from  the  final  protocol  defined  analyses  for  progression  free  survival  and 
response rates for the independently powered capecitabine cohort of Study AVF3694g are presented in 
Table 9. Results from an exploratory overall survival analysis which include an additional 7 months of 
follow-up  (approximately  46%  of  patients  had  died)  are  also  presented.  The  percentage  of  patients 
who  received  Avastin  in  the  open-label  phase  was  62.1%  in  the  capecitabine  +  placebo  arm  and 
49.9% in the capecitabine + Avastin arm.

bStratified analysis included all progression and death events except those where non-protocol therapy 
(NPT)  was  initiated  prior  to  documented  progression;  data  from  those  patients  were  censored  at  the 
last tumour assessment prior to starting NPT.  
An  unstratified  analysis  of PFS  (investigator  assessed) was  performed  that  did  not  censor  for  non-
protocol  therapy  prior  to  disease  progression.  The  results  of  these  analyses  were  very  similar  to  the 
primary PFS results.

Finally Annex II has been updated in order to reflect the latest version of the RMP. 
Recommendation following re-examination 
On 14 April 2011 and subsequently 19 May 2011 the CHMP considered the re-examination of this Type 
II variation and in its final opinion concluded by majority that the risk-benefit balance of Avastin in the 
indication 
''Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with 
metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  treatment  with  other  chemotherapy  options  including  taxanes  or 
anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate.  Patients  who  have  received  taxane  and  anthracycline-

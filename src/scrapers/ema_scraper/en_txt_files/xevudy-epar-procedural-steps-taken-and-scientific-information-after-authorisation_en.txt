are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

in vitro activity of sotrovimab in a pseudotyped virus 
assay against the Omicron XBB.1.5 and BN.1 spike 
variants (PC-23-0104), the Omicron CH.1.1 spike 
variant (PC-23-0108) and the Omicron BR.2 and XBF 
spike variants (PC-23-0117), as well as data on the 
in vitro activity of sotrovimab in a live virus assay 
against the SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 variant (PC-23-
0106) and the CH.1.1 variant (PC-23-0118). 
In vitro neutralization data for omicron XBB.1.5, CH.1.1, 
BN.1, BR.2 and XBF are provided within this variation to 
update the SmPC with the new antiviral activity information 
for sotrovimab. Omicron BN.1 exhibits the highest 
resistance to in vitro neutralization by sotrovimab detected 
so far. As regards the other omicron lineages for which new 
data was provided (XBB.1.5, CH.1.1, BR.2 and XBF), 
XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1 exhibited the highest sotrovimab 
resistance. The sotrovimab resistance of XBB.1.5 appears

SmPC 
The update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the product 
data on epitope conservation and activity of 
sotrovimab against pseudotyped virus encoding 
epitope variants (PC-7831-0143 v15), as well as 
data on the in vitro activity of sotrovimab in a 
pseudotyped virus assay against the Omicron BA.4.6 
spike variant (PC-22-0130), the Omicron BQ.1.1 
spike variant (PC-22-0142), the Omicron BQ.1, BF.7, 
BA.2.75.2 and XBB.1 spike variants (PC-22-0145). 
In addition, an editorial change is made to section 
4.2 of the SmPC for increased clarity as to the 
settings in which sotrovimab can be administered, 
and to section 4.1 to advise prescribers on the 
activity of sotrovimab against SARS-CoV2 viral 
variants of concern. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
information is supported by data on epitope conservation 
and activity of sotrovimab against pseudotyped virus 
encoding epitope variants, as well as data on in vitro 
neutralization potency of sotrovimab against omicron 
lineages BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. 
Based on the new data, and taking into account current 
knowledge as regards sotrovimab's neutralizing as well as 
Fc-mediated functions, it is at present considered 
scientifically justified to conclude that it is unlikely that 
sotrovimab might be expected to provide clinical benefit 
against certain omicron lineages currently driving the 
COVID-19 pandemic, such as BQ.1.1.

Product Characteristics.

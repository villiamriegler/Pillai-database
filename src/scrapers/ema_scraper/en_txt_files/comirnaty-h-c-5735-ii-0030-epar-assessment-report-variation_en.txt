2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China 
and has rapidly spread around the world by human to human transmission. In December 2019, a 
pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, it became clear 
that a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause. In early January 2020, the genetic 
sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and public, and 
the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily. By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic 
tree revealed a closer relationship to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus isolates than to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 6/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other coronaviruses that infect humans, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 
coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease COVID-19 have since then spread 
globally. On 11 March 2020 the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for BNT162b2 (30 µg) are: 
•  Proposed indication: Active immunization to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals ≥12 years of age (extension including 12-15 year olds) 
•  Dosing administration: single 0.3-mL intramuscular (IM) dose followed by a second 0.3-mL 
dose 3 weeks later 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
All ages may present with the disease, but notably, case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons 
>60 years of age. Comorbidities are also associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are over-
represented among COVID-19 patients due to occupational exposure to infected patients.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of Covid-19 in adults and elderly, but 
none for the use in adolescents 12-15 years old. Covid-19 in adolescents is mostly a mild disease 
although severe cases also occur rarely.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface 
protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the 
Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been shown that 
antibodies against the Spike protein neutralise the virus and prevent infection. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The presentation of COVID-19 is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing 
ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or 
radiographic changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling 
transmission. For symptomatic subjects, progression of disease may lead to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome requiring ventilation and subsequent multi-organ failure and death. 
Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry 
cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and 
rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in 
approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19.  
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID 19 symptoms as including 1 
or more of the following:  
• 
• 
Fever 
New or increased cough

In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. The reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test methods targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA are 
the gold standard in vitro methods for diagnosing suspected cases of COVID-19. Samples to be tested 
are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular methods used to confirm an active 
infection are usually performed within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may 
begin. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The vaccine is based on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) antigens encoded in RNA formulated in 
lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and is referred to as BNT162b2 (BioNTech code number BNT162, Pfizer code 
number PF-07302048). The structural elements of the vector backbones of BNT162 vaccines are 
optimized for prolonged and strong translation of the antigen-encoding RNA. The potency of RNA 
vaccines is further optimized by encapsulation of the RNA into LNPs, which protect the RNA from 
degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host cells after IM delivery. 
The vaccine is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in 
individuals 16 years of age and older. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH has not applied for CHMP scientific advice on the paediatric development of Comirnaty. A PIP 
has been agreed (PIP P/0179/2021) and the current study is part of the PIP.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that all clinical studies were performed in accordance with GCP. The current application 
is based on study C4591001, which was also the pivotal phase 3 study included in the application for 
initial approval. The study was extended to include subjects 12-15 years of age.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Phase 2/3 of Study C4591001 
Methods 
Study participants 
Initially, participants enrolled in Phase 2/3 of Study C4591001 were to be 18 to 85 years of age, in 2 
age strata: 18 to 55 years (“younger participants”) and 56 to 85 years (“older participants”). It was 
intended that a minimum of 40% of participants would be in the >55-years stratum. The protocol was 
later amended to lower the minimum age of participants to 16 years and to remove the upper age limit 
(Protocol Amendment 6, 08 September 2020). 
Protocol Amendment 7 (06 October 2020) allowed for enrollment of adolescents 12 to 15 years of age 
as an additional age stratum. The 12- to 15-year stratum was expected to comprise up to 
approximately 2000 participants enrolled at selected investigational sites. 
Treatments 
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either BNT162b2 (30 µg) or placebo (normal 
saline). Participants received a 2-dose regimen, administered approximately 21 days apart, at Visit 1 
and at Visit 2, with Visit 2 intended to take place 19 to 23 days after Visit 1. 
Objectives 
Only objectives relevant to the current application are listed below: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 occurring from 7 
days after the second dose in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination 
(subgroup 12-15 years) 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID-19 occurring from 
7 days after the second dose in participants with and without evidence of infection before 
vaccination (Subgroup 12-15 years) 
• 
To define the safety profile of prophylactic BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age in 
Phase 3 
• 
To demonstrate the noninferiority of the immune response to prophylactic BNT162b2 in 
participants 12 to 15 years of age compared to participants 16 to 25 years of age  (Secondary 
immunogenicity objective)

Due to a testing laboratory supply limitation of the qualified viral lot used during the validation of the 
assay and clinical testing of samples, immunogenicity analyses were performed only on samples from 
participants who had the required tests completed using the same available viral reagent lot. A blinded 
review of the samples tested at that time suggested a sufficient sample size properly balanced across 
age groups to perform the planned NI analysis. It was estimated that if the true geometric mean ratio 
(GMR) is ≥0.88, there is approximately 90% power to demonstrate NI using the number of samples 
currently tested, and >99% power if the true GMR is 1. This approach was mutually agreed with the 
US FDA. 
Immunogenicity endpoints analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titres included: 
• 
• 
• 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 1 month after Dose 2 
geometric mean-fold rise (GMFR) from before vaccination to 1 month after Dose 2 
percentage of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 
month after Dose 2 (seroresponse rate) 
Immunogenicity Analysis Methods 
NI was assessed in participants who had no serological or virological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after Dose 2; assessment was based on the geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing titers (GMT in adolescents/GMT in young adults) at 1 month after Dose 2 using a 1.5-fold 
margin. The GMR and its 2-sided 95% CI were derived by calculating differences in means and CIs on 
the natural log scale of titers based on Student’s t-distribution, then exponentiating the results. The 
difference in means on the natural log scale was calculated as: (12-15 years of age) – (16-25 years of 
age). NI was declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR was >0.67. 
A supportive analysis was conducted to assess the seroresponse rate, based on the proportions of 
participants in each age group with a ≥4-fold rise in neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 
month after Dose 2. The difference in percentages (% adolescents minus % young adults) and the 
associated 2-sided 95% CI calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method were provided. GMTs 
and GMFRs of the neutralizing titers were provided with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs calculated 
with reference to Student’s t-distribution. 
Immunogenicity results were summarized for all participants with or without serological or virological 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination, and results were also summarized by baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status. Positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was defined as positive N-binding antibody or 
positive NAAT at Visit 1, or a medical history of COVID-19; negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was 
defined as negative N-binding antibody and negative NAAT at Visit 1 and no medical history of COVID-
19. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints analysed and reported for adolescents 12 to 15 years of age in this Type II 
variation include the following endpoints: 
•  COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants either (1) without or (2) 
with and without serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and 
during the vaccination regimen – cases confirmed ≥7 days after Dose 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 11/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Severe COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants either (1) 
without or (2) with and without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the 
vaccination regimen – cases confirmed ≥7 days after Dose 2. 
Surveillance/Definitions /Case Determination for Confirmed COVID-19 
Participants who developed any of the potential COVID-19 symptoms listed in the protocol were to 
contact the site immediately and, if confirmed, to participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon 
as possible (optimally within 3 days of symptom onset, and at the latest 4 days after symptom 
resolution). At the visit (or prior to the visit, if a participant utilized a self-swab as permitted per 
protocol), investigators were to collect clinical information and results from local standard-of-care tests 
sufficient to confirm a COVID-19 diagnosis. 
Confirmation of Infection with SARS-CoV-2: Investigators were to obtain a nasal swab (mid-
turbinate) for testing at a central laboratory using a validated reverse transcription– polymerase chain 
reaction test (Cepheid; EUA200047/A001) to detect SARS-CoV-2. If the evaluation was conducted by 
telehealth, the participant was to self-collect a nasal swab and ship for assessment at the central 
laboratory. A local NAAT result was only acceptable if it met protocol-specified criteria and if a central 
laboratory result was not available. 
Confirmed COVID-19 was defined (per FDA guidance)1 as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result 
per central laboratory or local testing facility (using an acceptable test per protocol only if no central 
laboratory result was available) and the presence of at least 1 of the following: 
fever; new or increased cough; new or increased shortness of breath; chills; new or 
increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhea; vomiting. 
Confirmed severe COVID-19 was defined (per FDA guidance)1 as confirmed COVID-19 and the 
presence of at least 1 of the following: 
•  Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per 
minute, heart rate ≥125 beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level, or PaO2/FiO2 
<300 mm Hg); 
•  Respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical 
ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation); 
• 
Evidence of shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 
•  <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors); 
•  Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; 
•  Admission to an intensive care unit; 
•  Death 
In addition to the above protocol-specified definition of severe COVID-19, an efficacy analysis was 
conducted for confirmed severe COVID-19 according to the CDC-defined severe symptoms, ie, 
COVID-19 illness events that resulted in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, intubation 
or mechanical ventilation, or death.

Sample size 
Approximately 2000 participants were anticipated to be 12 to 15 years of age. A random sample of 
280 participants was planned to be selected for each of the 2 age groups (12 to 15 years and 16 to 25 
years) as an immunogenicity subset for the noninferiority assessment using a 1.5-fold margin. With 
the standard deviation and observed GMT difference assumed in the power analysis below, a sample 
size of 225 evaluable participants (or 280 vaccine recipients) per age group was chosen to provide a 
power of 90.4% to declare the noninferiority of adolescents to 16- to 25-year-olds in terms of 
neutralizing antibody GMR, 1 month after the second dose.  
Table Power Analysis for Noninferiority Assessment 
Randomisation 
Allocation (randomization) of participants to vaccine groups proceeded through the use of an IRT 
system (IWR).  The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) was required to enter or 
select information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol number, and 
the participant number.  The site personnel was then be provided with a vaccine assignment and 
randomization number.  The IRT system provided a confirmation report containing the participant 
number, randomization number, and study intervention allocationas signed.  The confirmation report 
was to be stored in the site’s files. The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual provided 
the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions 
were unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and 
participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments. 
When a participant who originally received placebo received BNT162b2 per Appendix 16.1.1 of the 
study protocol the study team was unblinded to the participant’s original study intervention allocation. 
The study was unblinded in stages once all ongoing participants either had been individually unblinded 
or had concluded their 6-month post–Dose 2 study visit, as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 (after Visit 8). 
Phase 2/3, ≥16 years (after Visit 4). 
Phase 3, 12 through 15 years (after Visit 4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 13/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Participants ≥16 years of age who originally received placebo and became eligible for receipt of 
BNT162b2 according to recommendations detailed separately, and available in the electronic study 
reference portal, had the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 in a phased manner as part of the study. 
The investigator ensured the participant met at least 1 of the recommendation criteria. 
Adolescents 12 through 15 years of age remain blinded in this study, as BNT162b2 vaccination 
eligibility in all markets/regions is currently for 16 years of age and older. Note that a few participants 
in the 12 through 15 years of age group turned 16 years of age after study enrollment and thus 
became eligible for unblinding to treatment assignment and vaccination under the emergency use or 
conditional authorization in their country/region. 
Timing of the analysis 
The updated efficacy analyses in the MAA Type II Variation for individuals 12-15 years of age were not 
event driven. The cut-off date of 13 March 2021 was used for immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy 
data for this age group in the pivotal study (C4591001) based on: 
 • timing of available immunobridging data (noninferiority analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing 
antibody titers as compared between 12-15 and 16-25 years of age groups)  
• timing of safety follow-up for median of at least 2 months after Dose 2 in the 12-15 years of age 
group, which meets requirements for emergency use authorization and aligns to the duration of safety 
follow-up for individuals age 16 and older filed in the initial MAA (07 December 2020).  
• timing of safety follow-up to 6 months after Dose 2 for individuals age 16 and older as required for 
US licensure and as planned to be submitted as an additional MAA Type II Variation in the near future.  
In this regard, the number of cases of COVID-19 included in the updated efficacy analysis was not 
prespecified and included all confirmed cases as of the selected cut-off date. The particular cut-off date 
(13 March 2021) was used for multiple analyses pragmatically. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis methods 
Updated efficacy analyses during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up were conducted for participants 
12 through 15 years of age based on the data cut-off date of 13 March 2021. The point estimate of VE 
in the blinded follow-up period and associated 2-sided 95% CI was derived using the Clopper Pearson 
method adjusted for surveillance time. In addition to the protocol definition of severe COVID-19, 
supportive analyses using the CDC definition of severe COVID-19 was also performed. VE was 
estimated by 100% × (1 – IRR), where IRR was the ratio of COVID-19 illness rate in the BNT162b2 
group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group.  
Hypothesis for Immunogenicity Bridging of 12 to 15 Years to 16 to 25 Years 
One of the secondary objectives in the Phase 3 part of the study is to evaluate noninferiority of the 
immune response to prophylactic BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age compared to the 
response in participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after Dose 2. The (Dose 2) evaluable 
immunogenicity population will be used for the following hypothesis testing:H0: ln(μ2) – ln(μ1) ≤ 
ln(0.67)where ln (0.67) corresponds to a 1.5-fold margin for noninferiority, ln(μ2) and ln(μ1) are the 
natural log of the geometric mean of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers from BNT162b2 recipients 12 to 
15 years of age and 16 to 25 years of age, respectively, measured 1 month after Dose 2.  If the lower

limit of the 95% CI for the GMR (12-15 years of age to 16-25 years of age) is >0.67, the noninferiority 
objective is met. 
For participants randomized to the BNT162b2 groups with no serological or virological evidence (up to 
1 month after receipt of the second dose) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 50% 
neutralizing titers in participants 12 to 15 years of age to those in participants 16 to 25 years of age 
and 2-sided 95% CIs were provided at 1 month after Dose 2 for noninferiority assessment. The GMR 
and its 2-sided 95% CI were derived by calculating differences in means and CIs on the natural log 
scale of the titers based on the Student’s t-distribution and then exponentiating the results. The 
difference in means on the natural log scale were 12 to 15 years minus 16 to 25 years. Noninferiority 
was declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR was greater than 0.67, using 1.5-
fold noninferiority margin. In addition, the difference in percentages of participants (12 to 15 years – 
16 to 25 years) achieving a ≥4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 
month after Dose 2 were provided. The associated 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentage 
was calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
For immunogenicity results of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers concentrations, the GMT was computed 
along with associated 95% CIs. The GMT was calculated as the means of assay results after making 
the logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the means to express results on the original 
scale. Two-sided 95% CIs were obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% 
CIs with reference to Student’s t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits.  
The GMFR was calculated by exponentiating the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
assay results (later time point – earlier time point). Two-sided CIs were obtained by calculating CIs 
using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results 
and exponentiating the confidence limits. The exact 95% CIs for binary endpoints were computed 
using the F distribution (Clopper-Pearson method). Titers below the LLOQ or denoted as BLQ were set 
to 0.5 × LLOQ for analysis.

The adolecent population 12-15 years was defined as a subgroup in original protocol, but few subjects 
were enrolled. In the part of the study performed for the current application only subjects 12-15 years 
were enrolled. Additionally, analyses were presented for different efficacy endpoint subgroups: First 
COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1, After Dose 1 to before Dose 2, ≥11 Days after Dose 1 to before 
Dose 2 , Dose 2 to 7 days after Dose 2, ≥7 Days after Dose  2, ≥7 days after Dose 2 to <2 Months after 
Dose 2 and ≥2 Months after Dose 2 to <4 Months after Dose 2. 
The statistical methods are considered acceptable to the CHMP in the context of demonstrating 
consistency with adult vaccine efficacy. 
The analyses provided in this submission are based on an amended version of the SAP, dated 17 March 
2021. Endpoints for the adolescent population in this SAP are consistent with the SAP used for the 
previous submission, where the adolescent population 12-15 years old were defined as a subgroup 
rather than a separate study population. As a result, the immunogenicity endpoint for adolescents was 
prespecified as a secondary immunogenicity endpoint, and vaccine efficacy for adolescents was not a 
prespecified endpoint. Hence, the VE efficacy results should be interpreted as descriptive and 
estimations rather than hypothesis testing.

Immunogenicity population 
The Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population for adolescents 12-15 years of age included 209 
participants in the BNT162b2 group and 36 participants in the placebo group), and for young adults 16-
25 years of age included 186 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 32 participants in the placebo 
group. Reasons for participant exclusion from the evaluable immunogenicity populations are shown in 
Table 1. The majority of exclusions were due to participants not having at least 1 valid and 
determinate immunogenicity result after Dose 2, mostly as the result of testing laboratory supply 
limitation of the qualified viral lot and were generally balanced across age and vaccine groups.

The disposition of adolescents (12-15 years of age) and young adults (16-25 years of age) was similar 
in BNT162b2 and placebo groups through 1 month after Dose 2 (Table 4). Most participants 
randomized in both age groups (≥97.4%) received Dose 1 and Dose 2. Among adolescents, 7 
participants (0.6%) in the BNT162b2 group and 17 participants (1.5%) in the placebo group 
discontinued from the vaccination period and are continuing in the study for safety follow-up. Most 
participants across age groups completed the visit at 1 month after Dose 2 (≥94.5%). 
Among adolescents who discontinued from vaccination period but continued in the study up to the 1 
month post Dose 2 visit, 2 participants discontinued due to AEs, both in the BNT162b2 group (pyrexia 
considered by the investigator as related to study intervention, and unrelated anxiety/depression) and 
none in the placebo group. 
No adolescents in the BNT162b2 and 2 participants in the placebo group withdrew from the study 
before the 1 month post Dose 2 visit. 
A total of 49 adolescent participants withdrew from the vaccination period when they turned 16 years 
of age after entering the study and became eligible to be unblinded to receive BNT162b2 vaccination; 
of these, 19/49 received Dose 3 and Dose 4 (BNT162b2). Participants originally randomized to placebo 
who received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (per protocol;) continued in open-label follow-up in the study, but 
their data were censored at the time of unblinding with regard to analyses in this report. 
Information for these participants are provided for SAEs or other significant AEs.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendment nr. 7 dated 6.10.2021 reduced the lower age range to include adolescents 12 to 
15 years of age and added corresponding objectives. 
Also, statistical hypothesis and power analysis for evaluation of noninferiority of the immune response 
to BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age to the response in participants 16 to 25 years of age 
were added. 
Protocol amendment nr 10 dated 1.12.2020 states that in light of additional information to better 
estimate the standard deviation of SARS-CoV-   2 neutralizing titers, the sample size for the 
noninferiority immunogenicity analysis in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was increased.

In the Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population adolescent (12-15 years of age) BNT162b2 group, 
50.7% of participants were male; 88.0% were White, 7.7% were Black or African American, and 2.4% 
were Asian; 10.5% were Hispanic/Latino; and the median age was 14 years. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status was positive for 4.8% of adolescent participants in the BNT162b2 group. Obese adolescents 
(based on age- and sex-specific body mass index) made up 8.3% (placebo group) to 11.5% 
(BNT162b2 group) of this age group in the evaluable immunogenicity population. 
Demographics were generally similar for BNT162b2 and placebo, and in adolescents and young adults 
16-25 years of age. 
Demographics of the evaluable immunogenicity population were similar to those in the all-available 
immunogenicity population. Likewise, the immunogenicity population demographics were generally 
similar to those in the safety population. 
Demographic characteristics for adolescents (12-15 years of age) and young adults (16-25 years of 
age) were similar in the corresponding BNT162b2 and placebo groups in the safety population (Table 
3).

The protocol prespecified final analysis of efficacy was completed with a data cut-off date of 14 
November 2020. At that time, few adolescents (12-15 years of age) had enrolled in the study, 
precluding a meaningful efficacy evaluation. An analysis was performed with all accrued cases during 
blinded follow-up to a data cut-off date of 13 March 2021, for efficacy in adolescents. 
Since the efficacy populations include nearly the same number of participants in each group as in the 
safety population, the demographics of the efficacy populations are essentially the same as the safety 
population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Immunogenicity Results – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
Noninferiority of Immune Response to Prophylactic BNT162b2 in Participants 12 Through 15 
Years Compared with Participants 16 Through 25 Years of Age 
The immune response to BNT162b2 in adolescents 12-15 years of age was noninferior to that observed 
in young adults 16-25 years of age, based on SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 1 month after 
Dose 2, in participants without prior evidence of SARS-COV-2 infection, and in fact greatly exceeded 
the response observed in young adults. The GMT ratio of adolescents to young adults was 1.76 (2-
sided 95% CI: 1.47, 2.10), meeting the 1.5-fold NI criterion (ie, lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
for GMR >0.67) (Table 20). Of note, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is >1 which 
indicates a statistically greater response in the adolescents than that of young adults.

Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2, high proportions (97.9% of adolescents and 100.0% of young adults) had a ≥4-fold rise 
(seroresponse) in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 month after Dose 
2. The difference in proportions of participants who had a ≥4-fold rise between the two age groups 
(adolescents – young adults) was -2.1% (2-sided 95% CI: -6.0%, 0.9%) (Table 21). 
GMTs – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
At 1 month after Dose 2 (Day 52) of BNT162b2, substantial increases above baseline in SARS-CoV-2 
50% neutralizing GMTs were observed in both age groups, with a greater magnitude of increase in the 
adolescent group compared with the young adult group

(Figure 2, Figure 3). The neutralizing GMT in adolescents at 1 month after Dose 2 was approximately 
1.76-fold that of the young adult group. As expected, the neutralizing GMTs were low in both placebo 
groups. 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status 
Vaccination with BNT162b2 induced an increased immune response (GMTs) at 1 month after Dose 2 
for all participants, regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative status. 
Adolescents who were baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive had SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs 
approximately 1.89-fold that of adolescents who were baseline negative (Supplemental Table 14.10). A 
similar pattern was observed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative young adults. 
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers for the Dose 2 all-available immunogenicity population were 
similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

GMFRs – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
The GMFRs of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 month 
after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 were robust, with a greater magnitude of rise in the adolescent group 
(118.3) compared with the young adult group (71.2) (Table 22). 
GMFR in Titers by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status 
The GMFRs were higher in the adolescent compared to young adult group 1 month after the second 
dose. Given the limited sample size for those positive at baseline, the GMFRs were numerically 
higher in those who were negative at baseline (Table 22). 
GMFRs of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers for the Dose 2 all-available immunogenicity 
population were similar to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

Seroresponse Rate – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
Proportions of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers from before 
vaccination to 1 month after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 (seroresponse rate) were 98.1% in adolescents and 
99.3% in young adults (Table 23). As expected, very few placebo participants reached a ≥4-fold rise 
in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers from before to 1 month after Dose 2. 
Adolescents who were baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative had similar seroresponse rates 
(100.0% vs 97.9%) (Table 23).

Phase 3 Immunogenicity Conclusions – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
Immune response to BNT162b2 30 µg in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers in adolescents 12-15 
years of age was noninferior to (and in fact exceeded) the immune response in young adults 16-25 
years of age, which provides immunobridging for adolescents. Substantial increases over baseline in 
neutralizing GMTs and high seroresponse rates were observed at 1 month after Dose 2 in both age 
groups, which were observed for participants with baseline SARSCoV-2 positive and negative status. 
The vast majority of BNT162b2 recipients in both age groups achieved a ≥4-fold rises from before 
vaccination to 1 month after Dose 2.

All Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 After Dose 1 – All-Available Efficacy Population – 
Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
As of the data cut-off date (13 March 2021), confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Dose 1 all- available 
efficacy (modified intention-to-treat) population adolescent group (12-15 years of age) included 3 
cases in the BNT162b2 group and 35 cases in the placebo group, with an observed VE of 91.6% (2-
sided 95% CI: 73.5%, 98.4%) (Table 19). 
The time interval from after Dose 1 to prior to receiving Dose 2 included 3 cases in the BNT162b2 
group and 12 cases in the placebo group; these 3 cases in the BNT162 group, which comprised all 
COVID-19 cases reported in the BNT162b2 group in this population at any time, all occurred within the 
period from after Dose 1 to <11 days after Dose 1. All 3 of these cases in the BNT162b2 group 
occurred in participants who had baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative status.

Vaccine Efficacy Against Severe COVID-19 – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
No severe COVID-19 cases (per protocol definition or CDC criteria) were reported in adolescents (12-
15 years of age) as of the data cut-off date (13 March 2021) 
Summary of main study 
Descriptive efficacy analyses were conducted for the adolescent group on cases accrued during blinded 
follow-up period through the data cut-off date of 13 March 2021. 
In the adolescent group, in the efficacy analyses in the evaluable efficacy population based on cases 
reported from at least 7 days after Dose 2 through the data cut-off date, the observed VE was 100% 
(0 and 16 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo group, respectively, with 2-sided 95% CI: 75.3%, 
100%) for individuals without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination 
regimen, and 100% (0 and 18 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo group, respectively, with 2-sided 
95% CI: 78.1%, 100%) for those with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before and 
during vaccination regimen.

sided 95% CI: 73.5%, 98.4%), with no cases reported in the BNT162b2 group starting from ≥11 days 
after Dose 1. 
No severe cases were reported in the 12-15 years of age group as of the date cut-off date. Overall, 
these efficacy data strongly support BNT162b2 use in adolescents 12-15 years of age. 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on part of the ongoing phase 3 study C4591001. The initial approval of 
Comirnaty was based on the phase 3 part of this study in subjects 16 years and older. The current 
variation is based on the part of the same study including 12-15 year old adolescents. The study was 
amended in October 2020 to include participants 12 to 15 years of age.  
A total of 2,260 adolescents were randomised equally to receive 2-dose of BNT162b2 vaccine 
(n=1131) and placebo (n=1129).The study was designed and powered for immunogenicity comparison 
(immunobridging) between adolescents and young adults (16-25 years) but an efficacy assessment 
was also included in the study; however this was not type 1 error controlled. Participants of the 2 age 
groups 12-15 years and 16-25 years were selected as test and reference for the non-inferiority 
assessment of immunogenicity.  
The Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population in the vaccine group included 209 participants 12-15 
years of age and 186 participants 16-25 years of age. The study is unblinded for older subjects, 
according to a protocol amendment and placebo recipients are offered vaccination. The study remains 
blinded for the 12-15 year olds, with the exception that when a subject turns 16, he or she becomes 
eligible for receipt of vaccination, and study blinding is therefore interrupted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There is currently no serological correlate of protection for Covid-19. However, the proposed 
mechanism of action for this vaccine, i.e. that neutralising antibodies are crucial for protection makes 
immunobridging to a population where efficacy has been demonstrated a reasonable strategy for 
ensuring efficacy in adolescents. Generally, adolescents have higher immune responses to vaccination 
compared to adults, which has been shown for e.g. HPV vaccines. This was shown to be the case also 
for this Covid-19 vaccine. The seroresponse rate was non-inferior (97% vs 100%) and the GMTs were 
in fact superior, which was not unexpected.  
Specifically, at 1 month after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 (cut-off date 13-Mar-2021), substantial increase in 
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT was observed in 12-15 years and 16-25 years age groups 
(regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2  status),  with a greater magnitude of increase (1.76-fold) in the 
adolescent group compared to the young adult group. This is to be expected as a better immune 
response has already been observed in adolescents with other vaccines. These results show that the 
immune response in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titers in adolescents was non-inferior to the 
immune response in 16-25 years participants and is even greater (lower bound CI95% for GMR at 1.47 
meeting the 1.5-fold NI criterion and >0.67), which provides the immunobridging between adolescents 
and young adults. 
Also, GMFRs of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 month post-
dose 2 were greater in the adolescent group (GMFR 118.3 (CI95% 101.4, 137.9)) than in 16-25 age 
group (GMFR 71.2 (CI95% 61.3, 82.7)) and were higher in participants who were negative at baseline 
compared to those positive at baseline (regardless of group age).  
A high proportion of participants (97.9% of adolescents and 100.0% of young adults) had a  ≥4-fold 
rise in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers (seroresponse) in both age groups from before vaccination 
to 1 month after Dose 2.

Efficacy data from 1,983 participants aged 12-15 years without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior 
to  7  days  after  dose  2  showed  an  observed  BNT162b2  efficacy  of  100%  (CI95%  75.3,  100%)  in 
preventing COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days post-dose 2 (0 COVID-19 cases in the BNT0162b2 group 
versus 16 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group). The same VE (100% (CI95% 78.1, 100) was observed 
in adolescents with or without evidence of infection prior to 7 days post-dose 2. 
Moreover, the observed VE in the Dose 1 all-available population was 100% (41.4, 100) in the interval 
starting from 11 days post-dose 1 to before dose 2 (0 cases in the BNT0162b2 group versus 8 COVID-
19 cases in the placebo group). 
Efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 was convincingly demonstrated in the age group 12-15 years).  
The effect size was in agreement with that seen in adults overall, which was also anticipated based on 
immunogenicity data (described in the pharmacology section of this report). Although there were few 
cases in the study (16 in the primary analysis) all occurred in the placebo group. As can be expected, 
no severe cases occurred in the study. The risk of severe disease increases with increasing age.  
The duration of protection is unknown in adolescents, as well as among adults. The efficacy for 
prevention of asymptomatic infection was not assessed. The efficacy against transmission would be of 
great interest to predict the impact of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 circulation, particularly among 
adolescents.  
The CHMP noted that the available efficacy data are insufficient to make definite conclusion about the 
long-term efficacy/duration of protection conveyed by the vaccine and the efficacy against 
asymptomatic infection; these uncertainties are raised and are therefore recommended by the CHMP 
to be adequately addressed post-authorisation.  (Interim) results should be submitted as soon as 
available (REC). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It can be concluded that Comirnaty protects individuals 12-15 years of age against symptomatic covid-
19 based on non-inferior immune responses, as well as a convincing exploratory analysis of efficacy. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
On the 21st of December 2020, BNT162b was granted a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) for 
preventing covid-19 in people from 16 years of age and older. This AR presents a part of the ongoing 
phase 2/3 study C4591001, that includes adolescents aged 12-15 years. According to amendment 7 
(6th of Oct 2021), adolescents from 12 years of age was allowed to be recruited.  The cut-off date for 
blinded follow-up for the interim analysis that this AR was 13th of March 2021. Similar dose of 
BNT162b2 (30μg) as in adult subjects has been administered to the adolescent subjects, by using a 2-
dose regimen administered about 3 weeks a part.  
Healthy participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant 
change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were 
included. This allowed enrolment of a proportion of participants with common comorbidities such as 
cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, chronic liver

disease, BMI > 30 kg/m2, participants with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease, and participants 
with varying disease severity. Among participants 12 to 15 years of age, 248 (21.9% ; 248/1131) of 
them with any baseline comorbidity were exposed to BNT162b2 (30µg): 118 subjects with chronic 
pulmonary disease, two with liver disease, two with diabetes with or without chronic complication and 
143 obese. 
The Applicant has provided data from young adults (aged 16-25 years) from study C4591001, this 
data is the same that was already included in the application for the CMA that was granted in 
December 2020. It shall be noted that this application concerns adolescents 12-15 years of age which 
have subsequently been recruited to the ongoing phase 3 study (C4591001) on which the initial CMA 
was based on (amendment in the study protocol in October 2020). The similar dose and dose regimen 
have been proposed as for adult subjects. As for comparison, the Applicant has provided data from 
young adult subjects, this population was already included in the data package that constituted the 
base for the granted CMA (December 2020). Since this data has already been assessed within the 
previous application, the focus in this report is on the new adolescent data.

Up to the cut-off date 13th of March 2021, a total of 2260 adolescents (BNT162b n=1131; placebo 
n=1129) aged 12-15 years have been recruited to the safety population. Within this age range the 
number of adolescents was similar for each age group. Gender was equally distributed. The adolescent 
subjects were recruited from the USA only. A majority was SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline (>90%). 
Slightly more than 10% of the adolescent subjects had a BMI that suggested obesity. The safety data 
base for adolescent 12-15 years of age is considered acceptable.  
Demographic information for the young adult population has also been provided.  
The included numbers of subjects are considered sufficient to evaluate the reactogenicity profile in 
adolescents who received two doses of BNT162b (30µg). It will however not be possible within this 
study to detect rare adverse reactions if such would occur specifically in adolescents.  
Exposure, disposition, and timing of administration 
The table below illustrates the number of subjects that has been exposed to one and two doses of 
BNT162b.

Follow-up Time After Dose 2 – Subjects 12 through 15 Years of Age –Safety Population 
Unblinding and vaccination of the placebo group 
Subjects included in the young adult group that received placebo, has susequently after the unblinding 
14th of December been been offered vaccination with BNT162b. Adolescents 12-15 years of age remain 
blinded in this study, as BNT162b2 vaccination eligibility in all markets/regions is currently for 16 years 
of age and older (note that a few participants in the 12-15 years of age group turned 16 years of age 
after study enrollment and thus became eligible for unblinding to treatment assignment and 
vaccination under emergency use or conditional marketing authorization). A total of 49 adolescent 
participants withdrew from the vaccination period when they turned 16 years of age after entering the 
study and became eligible to be unblinded to receive BNT162b2 vaccination; of these, 19/49 received 
Dose 3 and Dose 4 (BNT162b2). Participants originally randomized to placebo who received Dose 3 of 
BNT162b2 continued in open-label follow-up in the study, but their data were censored at the time of 
unblinding with regard to analyses in this submission.  
Sponsor and site personnel responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study remain blinded to 
individual adolescent (12-15 years of age) participants’ randomization for any who have not been 
unblinded. Safety evaluation for such participants by the study team remains blinded until a decision is 
made to unblind the entire study. A separate (from study conduct) unblinded submissions team is 
responsible for regulatory submissions including this submission.  
Almost all adolescent subjects (99%) aged 12-15 years as well as the subjects in the young adolescent 
group received two doses of BNT162b2.  
More than half of the adolescent safety population (BNT162b 58%; placebo 57%) had ≥2 months of 
follow-up after Dose 2. The median duration of follow-up was >2 months after Dose 2. Almost all 
(98.3%) adolescent participants had at least 1 month of follow-up after Dose 2. 
The majority received their 2nd dose 14-27 days after Dose 1 (97%).  
Seven adolescent subjects left the study; two subjects who received BNT162b2 discontinued due to 
adverse events, three did no longer meet the eligibility criteria, one discontinued due to physician 
decision and one subject discontinued due to other reason.  
Subjects that turned 16 years of age after study enrolment became eligible for unblinding to treatment 
assignment and vaccination under emergency use or conditional marketing authorization.

Adverse events 
Reactogenicity 
Reactogenicity (local reactions and systemic events) was assessed via e-diary in all adolescents 12-15 
years of age up to 7 days after each dose. The number of adolescent participants (12-15 years of age) 
with e-diary data were N=1131 in the BNT162b2 group and N=1129 in the placebo group post Dose 1, 
and N=1124 in the BNT162b2 group and N=1117 in the placebo group post Dose 2.  
Young adult participants (16-25 years of age) in the reactogenicity subset with e-diary data included 
N=539 in the BNT162b2 group and N=564 in the placebo group post Dose 1, and N=526 in the 
BNT162b2 group and N=537 in the placebo group post Dose 2. 
For local reactogenicity, during the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, participants were asked to 
assess redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site and to record the symptoms in the 
reactogenicity e-diary. If a local reaction persisted beyond the end of the reactogenicity e-diary period 
following vaccination, the participant was requested to report that information. Redness and swelling 
were measured and recorded in measuring device units (range:1 to 21) and then categorized during 
analysis as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the grading scale. Pain at the injection site was 
assessed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according the grading scale 
For systemic reactogenicity, during the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, participants were asked 
to assess vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or 
worsened joint pain and to record the symptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary. The symptoms were 
assessed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale. 
Temperature was collected in the reactogenicity e-diary in the evening daily during the reactogenicity 
e-diary reporting period and at any time during the reactogenicity e-diary data collection periods when 
fever was suspected. Fever was defined as an oral temperature of ≥38.0°C. The highest temperature 
for each day was recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary. 
Local reactions 
In the BNT162b2 group, pain at the injection site was most frequently reported in adolescents and 
young adults, and frequency was similar after Dose1 and after Dose2 of BNT162b2 in adolescents 
(86% vs 79%). 
After the first and second dose, most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local 
reactions were reported infrequently (≤1.5%) across the BNT162b2 and placebo groups after any 
dose. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported. Median onset for all local reactions was Day 1 to Day 3 
(Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and resolved with a median duration of 1-3 day.

Table 1. Participants Reporting Local Reactions, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose 
–Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis – Safety Population by Age Group: 12-15 Years and 16-
25 Years 
The most common local reaction was pain at injection site, which was reported in >85% of the 
adolescent subjects after the first dose. The majority of the local reactions were transient and mild to 
moderate at intensity. The CHMP noted that the frequency of subjects that experienced pain at 
injection site was slightly higher than what has been described for the adult population in the SmPC. 
The SmPC has been updated to separately reflect the frequency of the most commonly reported 
reactogenicty events in adolescents, which is endorsed by the CHMP. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
Systemic events 
The frequency of the reported systemic events is described in the table below. As illustrated in the 
table, the rate of fever was somewhat higher in the adolescent group compared to the young adult 
group (10.1% vs 7.3% after Dose1, respectively), especially after the second dose (19.6% vs 17.2%, 
respectively) 
Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipyretic/pain medication in adolescents was 36.6% and 
50.8%, which were in line with the reports from young adults (31.5% and 45.7%). Use of 
antipyretic/pain medication was less frequent in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group and 
was similar after Dose1 and Dose2 (ranging from 8.8% to 11.9% in both adolescents and young 
adults).  
After the first and second dose, most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe 
systemic events were reported infrequently in adolescents (≤3.5%) and young adults (≤6.0%) across

BNT162b2 and placebo groups after any dose. One adolescent in the BNT162b2 group had Grade 4 
pyrexia (40.4°C) on Day 2 after Dose 1, with temperature returning to normal on Day 4 (reported as 
an AE leading to withdrawal). Median onset for all systemic events after either dose of BNT162b2 was 
Day 1 to Day 4 (Day1 was the day of vaccination). Systemic events resolved post each dose with a 
median duration of 1 day, except fatigue and chills which resolved within a median of 1-2 days. 
Table 2. Participants Reporting Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each 
Dose – Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis – Safety Population by Age Group: 12-15 Years 
and 16-25 Years 
The most common systemic events were fatigue, headache, chills and muscle pain. It is noted that 
fever was reported in 10% of the adolescent subjects after the first dose and in 20% after the second 
dose, which is higher than reported for both young adults (as included in this report) and adults (as 
described in the SmPC). Most of the systemic events resolved within 3 days and were mild to moderate 
at intensity. The frequency of subjects that experienced systemic events such as fatigue, headache, 
chills and fever were in general slightly higher than what is described for the adult population in the 
SmPC. The SmPC has been updated to describe the frequency of the most commonly reported 
reactogenicty events in adolescents, which is endorsed by the CHMP. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
AEs reported by the participants 
Principal AE recording 
The time periods and safety analysis groups for the study are presented in Figure 8 below. In this 
clinical study report, AE results are from the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period:

•  Blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 
(frequencies): adolescents (12-15 years of age), young adults (16-25 years of age), and 
adults (16-55 years of age)) 
•  Blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period from Dose 1 to the data cut-off date (13 March 
2021): adolescents (12-15 years of age) 
•  Blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period from Dose 1 to the unblinding date (IRs): adults 
(16-55 years of age) 
For AE analyses beyond 1 month after Dose 2 in adult participants, IRs are reported (as opposed to 
frequencies) to account for the variable exposure since unblinding began for individual participants. 
Safety data from participants 16 through 55 years of age are included for comparative purposes, and a 
full independent safety evaluation of this age group along with participants >55 years of age will be 
reported separately at a later time. 
In adolescents (age 12-15 years) AEs were analysed in two time frames, ie from dose 1 to 1 month 
after dose 2 and until the cut-off (13 march 2021), respectively. Young adults were analyzed from 
dose 1 to one month after dose 2 for comparative reasons. Data for young adults has been evaluated 
in a previous application and is therefore not analysed in depth within this AR. 
Likewise, safety data from participants 16 through 55 years of age (older adults) are included for 
comparative purposes. In the age group 16-55 years AEs were analysed in from dose 1 to 1 month 
after dose 2 (given as frequencies) or up to the unblinding date reporting IRS (not frequencies), to 
account for the variable exposure since unblinding began for individual participants.

An overview of AEs from Dose 1 to one month after Dose 2 for adolescents (12-15 years of age) and 
young adults (16-25 years of age; utilizing the reactogenicity subset) is shown below. The number of 
participants with any AE were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups for both age groups.  
For all following AE and SAE analyses the MAH compared the adolescent subset (12-15 year old 
children) with the reactogenicity subset of young adults (16-25 years of age; 537 and 561 individuals) 
for the time frame first dose to one month after the second dose.  
AEs were lower in the adolescent group compared to young adults (6.0% versus 10.8 %) and 
comparable to placebo. SAE rates were low in both age groups (≤0.4%). No adolescent died. 
AE frequencies from dose 1 to one month after dose 2 in adults 16-55 years were clearly higher 
(32.6% versus 14.4%) in the vaccine arm compared to placebo and also higher when comparing with 
children and young adults. Rates of SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal were low in adults (0.4%, and 
0.2%, respectively).  
Dose 1 to Data Cut-off Date – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
An overview of AEs from Dose 1 to the cut-off date for 2260 adolescents (12-15 years of age) during 
the blinded safety follow-up is presented in table below. Data for young adults are not included since 
they had different follow-up time up to the data cut-off date due to enrollment starting time for the 
age groups into the study and due to unblinding of individuals ≥16 years of age per protocol for 
vaccination under EUA (unlike the adolescents who remain blinded to treatment assignment).

AEs from dose 1 to the cut-off date were analysed and presented for all 2260 adolescents (12-15 years 
of age) during the blinded safety follow-up. Data for young adults are not included since they had 
different follow-up time up to the data cut-off date.  
AEs, SAEs and withdrawel rates due to AEs were overall comparable between verum and placebo arm 
in adolescents.  
In older adults, AEs from dose 1 to participants’ unblinding date IR of at least 1 AE reported in the 
vaccine group as compared with the placebo group was 88.4 versus 43.5 per 100 PYs. Severe AEs, 
SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal were reported at IRs of ≤3.9, ≤2.4, and ≤0.6 per 100 PYs, 
respectively, in both study arms.  
Analysis of Adverse Events, SOCs and PTs 
Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2  
AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 for all adolescents and for young adults (in the 
reactogenicity subset) are presented in Table 28. AEs reported in adolescents were generally similar to 
young adults within the respective BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Most of the AEs after Dose 1 up to 1 
month after Dose 2 were reactogenicity events reported as AEs (ie, headache, nausea, and diarrhoea). 
In adolescents, AE frequencies in these reactogenicity SOCs (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions (16 [1.4%] vs 11 [1.0%]) 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (9 [0.8%] vs 8 [0.7%]) 
• 
• 
nervous system disorders (12 [1.1%] vs 7 [0.6%]) 
gastrointestinal disorders (14 [1.2%] vs 3 [0.3%]) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 42/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In young adults, AE frequencies in these reactogenicity SOCs (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions (21 [3.9%] vs 10 [1.8%]) 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (12 [2.2%] vs 8 [1.4%]) 
• 
• 
nervous system disorders (13 [2.4%] vs 7 [1.2%]) 
gastrointestinal disorders (5 [0.9%] vs 6 [1.1%]) 
Overall, AEs reported in adolescents and young adults at 1 month after Dose 2 were largely 
attributable to reactogenicity events. This observation provides a reasonable explanation for the 
greater rates of AEs observed overall in the BNT162b2 group compared with the placebo group.

AEs reported from dose 1 to one month after dose 2 for all adolescents and for young adults in the 
reactogenicity subset were generally a little bit lower in adolescents compared to young adults. AEs 
were similar in adolescents between vaccine and placebo arm and marginally higher in the vaccine arm 
compared to placebo in young adults. Most often occuring SOCs were similar in adolescents and young 
adults, and represented by general disorders and administration site conditions (injection site pain, 
fatigue, pyrexia, chills), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (arthralgia, myalgia), nervous 
system disorders (headache, dizziness) and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhoea). Thus, the 
safety profile in both age groups was comparable to that already known for adults.   
To mention are 0.8% vs 0.2%  (9 vs 2) cases of lympadenopathy in adolescents (vaccine/placebo) 
compared to 0.2% versus 0.0% cases in young adults. Pain in extremity was observed in 0.1% and 
0.0% cases in adolescents (1 vs 0 cases, vaccine versus placebo; no cases in young adults). Different 
forms of rash (2 vs. 5 cases) or urticaria (2 vs. 4 cases) were reported for each term in 0.2%/0.4% 
cases in adolescents (vaccine/placebo).  
Dose 1 to Data Cut-off Date – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
AEs reported from Dose 1 to the data cut-off date for adolescents (13 March 2021) are presented in 
the table below. 
AEs reported in adolescents through the data cut-off date were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo 
groups. The most frequently reported AEs in adolescents through the data cut-off date included 
lymphadenopathy (9 [0.8%]), injection site pain (7 [0.6%]), fatigue (7 [0.6%]), pyrexia (5 [0.4%]), 
nausea (5 [0.4%]), and headache (5 [0.4%]).

AEs reported from dose 1 to the data cut-off date for adolescents (13 March 2021) occurred in overall 
low frequency (6.3%/6.4%, vaccine/placebo). Most often occuring SOCs were slightly more common in 
the vaccine arm compared to placebo with general disorders (1.4% / 1.0%  vaccine/ placebo; most 
often occuring PTs injection site pain, fatigue), gastrointestinal disroders (1.2% / 0.3% vaccine / 
placebo; most common PTs nausea, diarrhoea) neurological disorders (1.1% / 0.6% vaccine / placebo 
; most common PTs headache, dizziness), inury poisening and procedural complications (0.8% / 1.2% 
vaccine / placebo; most common PTs concussion, accident) and musculoskeletal disorders (0.8% / 
0.7% vaccine / placebo; most common PTs arthralgia, myalgia).  
PTs of interest and known to occur with the vaccine occurred in overall low frequency, i.e. 
lymphadenopathy (0.8% (9 cases) vs 0.2% (2 cases)), injection site pain (0.6% vs 0.6%), fatigue 
(0.6% vs 0.4%), pyrexia (0.4% vs 0%), nausea (0.4% vs 0.1%), headache (0.4% vs 0.4%), myalgia 
(0.2% vs 0.3%) and arthralgia (0.2% vs. 0.3%). To mention also are one case of neuralgia (not 
related, see also below) and 1 case of paraesthesia in the vaccine arm. 
In comparison, AEs in adults 16-55 years of age belonged mostly to the SOCs general disorders and 
administration site conditions (3161 [24.3%] vs 681 [5.2%]), musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (1201 [9.2%] vs 303 [2.3%]), nervous system disorders (1067 [8.2%] vs 393 [3.0%]), and 
gastrointestinal disorders (440 [3.4%] vs 288 [2.2%)] one month after dose 2. A similar picture was 
observed for the time frame first dose up to unblinding. Thus, SOCs occurring in adolescents were 
comparable to those seen in adults. 
Related Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2 – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, AEs assessed as related by the investigator in adolescents and 
young adults were similar in the BNT162b2 group and in the placebo group (Table 24). Most related 
AEs were reactogenicity events and in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, 
reported by 15 adolescents (1.3%) and 19 young adults (3.5%) in the BNT162b2 group compared with 
9 adolescents (0.8%) and 9 young adults (1.6%) in the placebo group. Related events of 
lymphadenopathy were reported in the 7 adolescents in the BNT162b2 group and 1 adolescent in the 
placebo group, compared with 1 young adult in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group.

Related AEs up to one month after dose 2 were lower in frequency in adolescents (2.9%/1.9%; 
vaccine/placebo) compared to young adults (6.2%/2.1%) and occurred more often in the vaccine 
compared to placebo arm. Most related AEs were reactogenicity events (SOC of general disorders and 
administration site conditions). Lymphadenopathy was more often observed and evaluated as related 
in adolescents who received vaccine compared to placebo (7 vs. 1 individuals). Those events were less 
frequent in young adults (1 vs 0 events). Related AE frequencies were clearly higher in adults 16-55 
years with 26.8.% versus 6.8% (vaccine vs. placebo) and occurred more often with the vaccine. As for 
adolescents, events belonged mostly to the SOC general disorders and administration site conditions 
(24.0% vs. 4.7%, vaccine vs. placebo). 
Immediate Adverse Events – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
After Dose 1, adolescents and young adults with immediate AEs were low in frequency (≤0.4%) and 
were reported only in the placebo groups. All immediate AEs after Dose 1 were in the SOCs of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (injection site pain, injection site erythema, and vessel 
puncture site pain) and nervous system disorders (dizziness and headache). 
After Dose 2, adolescents and young adults with immediate AEs were low in frequency (≤0.4%) in 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Most immediate AEs after Dose 2 were in the SOC of general disorders 
and administration site conditions (injection site pain, injection site bruising, injection site 
hyperesthesia, fatigue, chills; 1-2 participants reporting each). Other immediate AEs after Dose 2 were 
reported in the SOC of nervous system disorders (dizziness; 1 participant in the BNT162b2 adolescent 
group) or skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (rash maculo-papular; 1 participant in the placebo 
adolescent group). 
No allergic AEs were reported after either dose of BNT162b2 within 30 minutes after vaccination.

Immediate AEs were low in frequency (≤0.4%) after dose 1 and were reported only in the placebo 
groups in adolsecents and young adults.  
After Dose 2, adolescents and young adults with immediate AEs were low in frequency (≤0.4%) in 
vaccine and placebo arm. Isolated AEs such as injection site pain or dizziness were seen in the vaccine 
arm of adolescents. No allergic AEs were reported with the vaccine within 30 minutes after vaccination. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2 – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age  
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, severe AEs reported in adolescents and young adults were 
overall low in number and frequency: 7 (0.6%) participants in the BNT162b2 group versus 2 (0.2%) 
participants in the placebo group among adolescents, and 9 (1.7%) participants in the BNT162b2 
group versus 3 (0.5%) in the placebo group among young adults (Table 24).  
Among adolescents, 2 participants (1 each in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups) had at least 1 life-
threatening (or Grade 4) AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2. These included: 
• 
Focal peritonitis and appendicitis reported in 1 adolescent in the placebo group, occurring 
concurrently 19 days after Dose 2 with a duration of 2 days, and considered by the investigator

as not related to study intervention; both events were reported as SAEs, resolved, and the 
participant continued in the study 
Pyrexia (40.4°C) reported as Grade 4 in 1 adolescent in the BNT162b2 group, occurred
on Day 2 after Dose 1, with temperature returning to normal on Day 4), and was considered
by the investigator as related to study intervention; the event was reported by the investigator
as non-serious, resolved, and the participant withdrew from the study (also recorded in the e-
diary as reactogenicity systemic event). Additionally, 2 participants in the adolescent age
group had life-threatening AEs that occurred after they turned 16 years of age during the
study and were unblinded to receive BNT162b2 and were therefore not included in analyses of
blinded data (per protocol.
•
Anaphylactoid reaction reported in 1 participant originally randomized to the placebo group, 3
days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 (Dose 3) with a duration of 1 day, considered
by the investigator as related to study intervention; the event was reported as an SAE,
resolved, and the participant withdrew from the study. The participant has ongoing medical
history of drug hypersensitivity, food allergy, and seasonal allergy.
• Depression reported in 1 participant originally randomized to the placebo group, 7 days after
receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 (Dose 3) reported as ongoing at the time of the data cut-
off date, considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention; the event was
reported as an SAE due to hospitalization  and reported as resolving, and the participant
continued in the study. Among young adults, there were no life-threatening AEs reported from
Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 (Table 24).
Severe AEs were low in frequency in adolescents (0.6%/0.2% vaccine/placebo) and less common 
compared to young adults (1.7%/ 0.5%).  
Two adolescents (one each in vaccine and placebo arm) showed grade 4 AEs, ie focal peritonitis and 
appendicitis (placebo group) and one case of pyrexia (40.4°C) in the vaccine arm, (occurrence day 2 
after dose 1, normalization day 4).The participant withdrew from the study. Furthermore, two 
adolescents reported life-threatening AEs after having turned 16 years of age after unblinding and 
vaccination with verum (dose 3), i.e. anaphylactoid reaction (3 days after the first dose of BNT162b2 
(dose 3), considered related, see also SAE section) and depression (7 days after receiving the first 
dose of BNT162b2 (dose 3), not related to study intervention, reported as SAE due to hospialization). 
In comparison, among young adults, there were no life-threatening AEs reported from Dose 1 to one 
month after dose 2. 
Older adults showed severe AEs in frequencies of 1.2% vs. 0.6% (vaccine/placebo), mainly due to 
events in the SOC general disorders and administration site conditions. As for adolescents, frequencies 
of life-threatening events were infrequent (0.1% in vaccine and placebo arm).  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Adverse events of clinical interest include AESIs, such as those in the CDC list of AESIs for 
COVID-19 that include events potentially indicative of severe COVID-19 or autoimmune and 
neuroinflammatory disorders, were considered, in addition to program-defined TMEs, in the review of 
reported events for the adolescent group. Narratives were prepared for such events reported in 
adolescents (12-15 years of age). If an AE of clinical interest was not observed in the 12-15 years of 
age group, narratives were not provided for individuals 16 and above. AEs of clinical interest occurring 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 55/81 
in the adolescent group were reviewed along with corresponding reference information from adults and 
are summarized below.  
Anaphylaxis 
No cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions were reported during blinded follow-up. 
in the adolescent (12-15 years of age) or young adult (16-25 years of age) groups as of the data cut-
off date (13 March 2021). One young adult participant (reported with both the 16-25 years of age and 
16-55 years of age group data) who was originally randomized to the placebo group and unblinded to
receive BNT162b2 had an anaphylactoid reaction (specific symptoms not specified) assessed as 
related, 3 days post Dose 3 (first dose of BNT162b2), with an event duration of 1 day; the event was 
reported as an SAE, reported as resolved, and the participant withdrew from the study (this participant 
has an ongoing medical history of drug hypersensitivity, food allergy, and seasonal allergy). Note that 
this event was not counted in the summary safety tables which only included blinded follow-up data. In 
adults (16-55 years of age), 1 other participant had an SAE of anaphylaxis caused by exposure to an 
allergen that was not considered related to study intervention.
Lymphadenopathy 
Lymphadenopathy is identified as an adverse reaction for BNT162b2 vaccine. In adolescents (12-15 
years of age), 7 participants (0.6%) in the BNT162b2 group and 1 participant (0.1%) in the placebo 
group had lymphadenopathy events assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The 
majority of these events occurred in the arm and neck region, were reported within 2-10 days after 
vaccination, and approximately half of events resolved within 1-10 days (others were ongoing at the 
time of the data cut-off date). In young adults (16-25 years of age), 1 related event of 
lymphadenopathy was reported up to the data cut-off date, occurring in the axilla within 1 day of Dose 
2 and resolved within 5 days. In adults (16-55 years of age), 52 participants (0.4%) in the BNT162b2 
group and 2 participants (0.0%) in the placebo group had lymphadenopathy events reported up to the 
unblinding date and assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The majority of 
these events occurred in the arm and neck region, were reported within 2-4 days after vaccination 
(usually after Dose 2), and typically resolved within approximately 1 week. 
Appendicitis 
In adolescents (12-15 years of age), 2 participants in the placebo group had events of appendicitis 
reported as SAEs and considered as not related to study intervention. In young adults (16-25 years of 
age), 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group had an event of appendicitis reported as an SAE and 
considered as not related to study intervention. In adults (16-55 years of age), 12 cases of 
appendicitis were reported in the BNT162b2 group and 7 cases in the placebo group during blinded 
follow-up through the unblinding date. All were considered as SAEs, not related to study intervention, 
and all participants recovered. 
Bell’s Palsy/Facial Paralysis/Facial Paresis 
No cases of facial paralysis were reported in adolescents (12-15 years of age) as of the data cut-off 
date (13 March 2021). 
No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the adolescent group (12-15 years) compared to one case in 
the young adult group. This subject developed an anaphylactoid reaction after unblinding and receipt 
of vaccine (originally randomised to the placebo arm in the adolescent group, and received vaccine 
after turning 16 years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 56/81 
In adolescents (12-15 years of age), 7 participants (0.6%) in the vaccine arm and one participant 
(0.1%) in the placebo group showed lymphadenopathy assessed by the investigator as related to 
study intervention. The majority occurred in the arm and neck region, 2-10 days after vaccination, and 
about half of events resolved within 1-10 days. In young adults (16-25 years of age), one related 
event of lymphadenopathy was reported up to the data cut-off date, occurring in the axilla within 1 day 
of dose 2 and resolved within 5 days. In adults (16-55 years of age), 52 participants (0.4%) in the 
vaccine group and two participants (0.0%) in the placebo group had lymphadenopathy events reported 
up to the unblinding date and assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The 
majority of these events occurred in the arm and neck region, were reported within 2-4 days after 
vaccination (usually after Dose 2), and typically resolved within approximately 1 week. 
No cases of facial paresis were observed in adolescents. 
No cases of appendicitis occurred in adolescents with the vaccine (two cases in the placebo arm). In 
young adults one participant in the vaccine arm developed appendicitis, considered as not related to 
study intervention by the study physician. In adults (16-55 years of age), 12 cases of appendicitis 
were reported in the vaccine group and 7 cases in the placebo group during blinded follow-up through 
the unblinding date. All were considered as SAEs and not related to study intervention.  
Other Safety Assessments 
Severe COVID-19 Illness 
The protocol had prespecified stopping rules that included monitoring of severe COVID-19 cases, and 
these stopping criteria were not met. As of the data cut-off date (13 March 2021), no severe COVID-19 
cases were reported in adolescents 12-15 years of age in Study C4591001, suggesting no evidence for 
vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
disease (VAERD). 
Pregnancy 
As of the data cut-off date (13 March 2021), no pregnancies were reported in participants 12-15 years 
of age. Four pregnancies were reported in the young adults (16-25 years of age) that led to 
discontinuation from the vaccination period, and 1 additional participant in the young adult group 
withdrew from the study due to a reported AE of exposure during pregnancy; none of these 
participants has given birth as of the data cut-off date.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in adolescent (12-15 years of age) or young adult (16-25 years of age) 
groups evaluated in safety analyses up to the data cut-off date (13 March 2021). 
Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
Dose 1 to 1 Month After Dose 2 – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age from Dose 1 to 1 month

reported at least 1 SAE were similar (Table 30). Overall, ≤0.4% of participants in both age groups 
reported any SAE after receiving BNT162b2 or placebo. 
No participants in either age group had SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study 
intervention. 
In the adolescent group, SAEs up to 1 month after Dose 2 were reported in the BNT162b2 group in 2 
participants with depression, 1 participant with concurrent events of anxiety and depression, and 1 
participant with neuralgia and 1 participant in the placebo group with concurrent events of appendicitis 
and focal peritonitis that were both Grade 4. 
The SAE of neuralgia was reported in 1 study participant who had 3 emergency room visits beginning
1 day after the second dose. The study participant reported concurrent non-serious AEs of genital
abscess, gastritis, and contact dermatitis. The study participant subsequently had SAEs of abdominal
pain and constipation. The study participant had an extensive work-up including serial physical and
laboratory examinations and was diagnosed with functional abdominal pain; the study participant was
referred to psychology and physical therapy, after which symptoms were reported as gradually 
improving. 
In the young adult age group, SAEs up to 1 month after Dose 2 were reported by 2 participants in the 
BNT162b2 group (1 participant with abdominal pain and 1 participant with appendicitis) and 2 
participants in the placebo group (1 participant had inguinal hernia, and 1 participant had flail chest 
associated with an accident). All SAEs in the young adult group were reported as resolved.
The rates of SAEs were similar and very low in adolscents and young adults and similar between 
vaccine arm and placebo in the time frame dose 1 to one month after dose 2 (≤0.4%). None of the SAE 
were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The two participants reporting 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 58/81 
SAEs in  adolescents showed anxiety/depression (3), and neuralgia (1), respectively. Neuralgia was 
reported in connection to genital abscess, gastritis, and contact dermatitis, abdominal pain and 
constipation in one participant. In the young adult age group, SAEs up to one month after dose 2 were 
reported by two participants in the vaccine group (one participant with abdominal pain and one 
participant with appendicitis). 
In older adults, 0.4% in each study arm reported SAEs up to one month after vaccination. 
Dose 1 to Data Cut-off Date – Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
From Dose 1 to the data cut-off date (13 March 2021), the proportions of adolescents who reported at 
least 1 SAE were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups (Table 31). Data for young adults are 
not included since they had different follow-up time up to the data cut-off date (due to enrollment 
starting time into the study and due to unblinding of individuals ≥16 years of age per protocol, for 
vaccination under EUA; refer to Section 9.1). Up to the data cut-off date, 5 adolescents (0.4%) in the 
BNT162b2 group and 2 adolescents (0.02%) in the placebo group reported any SAE. None of the SAEs 
were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. In addition to the SAEs that were 
previously reported up to 1 month after Dose 2, SAEs reported from after 1 month post Dose 2 up to 
the data cut-off date included abdominal pain and constipation reported concurrently in 1 participant 
(who also previously reported an SAE of neuralgia) in the BNT162b2 group. This participant was 
ultimately diagnosed with functional abdominal pain after an extensive work-up. An SAE of suicidal 
ideation was reported in 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group and an SAE of appendicitis was reported 
in 1 participant in the placebo group. All SAEs were reported as resolved/resolving except for the 
events of abdominal pain and constipation which remained unresolved as of the data cut-off date. 
Additionally, 2 adolescents originally randomized to the placebo group had SAEs that occurred after 
they turned 16 years of age during the study and were unblinded to receive BNT162b2, therefore the 
data are not included in the blinded analyses. These events were also considered as life-threatening: 
an anaphylactoid reaction reported in 1 participant 3 days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 
(Dose 3) with a duration of 1 day, considered by the investigator as related to study intervention and 
leading to study withdrawal; and depression reported in 1 participant 7 days after receiving the first 
dose of BNT162b2 (Dose 3) reported as ongoing/resolving at the time of the data cut-off date, 
considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 59/81 
The proportions of adolescents who reported at least 1 SAE were similar in the vaccine and placebo 
group (0.4% vs 0.2%) in the time frame dose 1 to the data cut-off date (13 March 2021). None of the 
SAEs were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The SAEs abdominal pain and 
constipation were reported concurrently in one participant, who also previously reported an SAE of 
neuralgia in the vaccine group (not related), and who was diagnosed with functional abdominal pain 
after an extensive work-up. Furthermore, one SAE of suicidal ideation was reported in one participant 
in the vaccine group.  
Two adolescents originally randomized to the placebo group had SAEs that occurred after they turned 
16 years of age during the study and were unblinded to receive BNT162b2: An anaphylactoid reaction 
reported in one participant 3 days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 (Dose 3) with a duration 
of 1 day, considered by the investigator as related to study intervention and leading to study 
withdrawal; and depression reported in 1 participant 7 days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 
(Dose 3) reported as ongoing/resolving at the time of the data cut-off date, considered by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention. 
From Dose 1 to the unblinding date, the IRs of adult participants (16-55 years of age) with at least 1 
SAE were similar in vaccine (2.1) and placebo (2.4) arm.

Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, few adolescents and young adults in the BNT162b2 group (≤
0.2%) and in the placebo group (≤0.4%) were withdrawn due to AEs (Table 32) In the adolescent 
group, 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group had an AE leading to withdrawal that was considered by 
the investigator as related to study intervention (pyrexia), and none in the placebo group. 
In the young adult group, one participant in the BNT162b2 group a had an AE leading to withdrawal 
that was considered by the investigator as related to study treatment (severe injection site pain that 
started 2 days after Dose 1 and resolved after 1 day), and none in the placebo group. 
Two adolescent subjects that received BNT162b discontinued or were withdrawn from the study. One 
subject experienced fever (40.5oC) which was considered related to study intervention which led to 
discontinuation, and one that experienced psychiatric disorders (anxiety and depression, not 
considered related to study intervention). No other reported AEs led to discontinuation. 
Overall, seven adolescent subjects left the study; two subjects who received BNT162b2 discontinued 
due to adverse events, three did no longer meet the eligibility criteria, one discontinued due to 
physician decision and one subject discontinued due to other reason.

Post marketing experience 
Comirnaty received a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in EU 21st of December 2020 for use 
in subjects 16 years and older. Since then, the vaccine has been extensively used worldwide. For 
further safety details, please see the EMA Monthly Summary Safety Reports (MSSRs) that has been 
executed on monthly basis since the vaccine received its CMA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application concerns adolescents 12-15 years of age which have subsequently been recruited to 
the ongoing phase 3 study (C4591001) on which the initial CMA was based. Similar dose of BNT162b2 
(30μg) as in adult subjects has been administered to the adolescent subjects, by using 2-dose regimen 
three weeks a part. 
Up to the cut-off date (13 Mar 2021), a total of 2260 adolescents (BNT162b n=1131; placebo n=1129) 
aged 12-15 years have been included in the safety population. Within this age range the number of 
adolescents was similar for each age group. Gender was equally distributed. The adolescent subjects 
were recruited from the USA only. The included numbers of subjects are considered sufficient to 
evaluate the reactogenicity profile in adolescent that receive two doses of BNT162b. However, if any 
rare adverse events were to occur specifically or more commonly in adolescent subjects, it would not 
be possible to detect these in this study. Notably, the safety data base for adult subjects is at this 
stage quite extensive given the >300 million administered doses worldwide that had occurred since 
December 2020.  
All adolescent subjects received the first dose and >99% received the second dose. The safety data 
base constitutes mainly of subjects with a follow-up time after the 2nd dose of ≥1 to <2 months (41%) 
and those which had ≥2 to <3 months of follow-up after dose 2 (54%). The majority received their 2nd 
dose 14-27 days after dose 1 (97%).  
Reactogenicity: Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in 
adolescents (86% dose1; 79% dose2), which was significantly higher compared to placebo (23% 
dose1; 18% dose2). Redness (6% dose1; 5% dose2) and swelling (7% dose1; 5% dose2) were also 
more frequently reported in the vaccinated group compared to placebo. 
The most commonly reported systemic events among the adolescent subjects that received BNT162b2 
were fatigue (60% dose1; 66% dose2), headache (55% dose1; 65% dose2), chills (28% dose1; 42% 
dose2), muscle pain (24% dose1; 32% dose2), joint pain (10% dose1; 16% dose2), fever (10% 
dose1; 20% dose2). Vomiting and diarrhoea was reported infrequently after both doses. 
The use of antipyretic/pain medication among adolescents was higher after the second dose (37% 
dose1; 51% dose2), among the placebo treated adolescents the use of antipyretic medication was 
about 10%. 
Most of the local and systemic events resolved within 3 days and were mild to moderate at intensity. 
In general, the reactogenicity appears to be higher than what has been described for the adult 
population. The SmPC has been updated to describe the frequency of the most reported local and 
systemic events in adolescents, which is endorsed by the CHMP. 
In light of the above, and considering the high GMTs elicited in children 12-15 years of age, the CHMP 
would recommend that further dose-finding in the paediatric population be performed post-
authorisation (REC).

In adolescents (12-15 years) AEs were analyzed in two different time intervals, i.e. from dose 1 to 1 
month after dose 2 or until the cut-off date (13 Mar 2021). For comparative reasons, young adults 
(reactogenicity subgroup, 16-25 years) and older adults (16-55) were analyzed from dose 1 to one 
month after dose 2 and in case of older adults also up to cut-off reporting incidence ratios (IR) to 
account for the variable exposure. Data for young adults and older adults have been evaluated in a 
previous application and are therefore not analysed in depth within this AR. 
AEs up to one month after dose 2 were lower in the adolescent group compared to young adults 
(6.0% versus 10.8 %). Event rates were roughly comparable to placebo in the adolescent age group.  
Same pattern was seen for AEs from dose 1 to the cut-off date.  
Related AEs were lower in frequency in adolescents (2.9%/1.9%; vaccine/placebo) compared to 
young adults (6.2%/2.1%) and older adults (26.8.%/6.8%, vaccine/placebo) and occurred more often 
in the vaccine compared to placebo arm. Most of the related AEs were reactogenicity events (SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions). Lymphadenopathy was more often observed and 
evaluated as related in adolescents who received vaccine compared to placebo (all cases: 9 vs 2; 
related cases:7 vs. 1).  
Severe AEs were low in frequency in adolescents (0.6%/0.2%, vaccine/placebo) and less common 
compared to young adults (1.7%/ 0.5%). One adolescent showed and grade 4 AE with the vaccine, i.e. 
pyrexia (40.4°C, start day 2 after dose 1, normalization day 4). Two adolescents reported life-
threatening AEs after having turned 16 years of age after unblinding and vaccination with verum, i.e. 
anaphylactoid reaction (3 days after the first dose of BNT162b2), considered related.  
In case of AESIs, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the adolescent group (12-15 years) 
compared to one case in the young adult/ adult, group who developed an anaphylactoid reaction after 
unblinding and receipt of vaccine (see also above). In adolescents, 7 vs 1 cases (0.6% vs 0.1%, 
vaccine/placebo) showed lymphadenopathy assessed by the investigator as related to study 
intervention; all cases in adolescents up to cut-off date: 9 (0.8%) vs 2 (0.2%)). No cases of facial 
paresis were observed in adolescents. No cases of appendicitis occurred in adolescents with the 
vaccine. No severe Covid-19 cases were reported for adolescents. 
The study is not large enough to determine whether there is rare adverse reaction with a higher 
frequency in adolescents compared to what has been seen in trials and real-life use in an older 
population.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety and efficacy of BNT162b2 in participants< 12 years of age have not been established as 
part of this extension of indication for the paediatric population above 12 years of age; further study 
of paediatric use of the vaccine and/or immunobridging study will be undertaken to characterise the 
vaccine response in children.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is based on an ongoing phase 2/3 study that has included 2260 (BNT162b 
n=1131; placebo n=1129) adolescent subjects aged 12-15 years. The same dose and dose regimen as 
for the adult population has been used. Overall, the reported reactogenicity profile is in line with what 
was observed in the adult population, even though a slightly higher frequency was noted in 
adolescents which is reflected in the updated SmPC. The reactogenicity profile is considered 
acceptable. The frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were low. The sample size does not allow 
detection of rare adverse reactions. 
The long-term safety of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is unknown at present, however further safety data 
are being collected in ongoing Study C4591001 for up to 2 years following administration of dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in all age groups. Additionally, active surveillance studies are planned to 
follow long-term safety in vaccine recipients. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

The MAH was requested to confirm that adolescents of 12-15 years will be included in each of the 
post-authorisation studies stated in the pharmacovigilance plan and comment on the envisaged 
paediatric sample size for each post-authorisation study, if applicable. The MAH responded that 5 of 
the 13 post-authorisation studies will included participants of 12-15 years old, which was endorsed; in 
7 post-authorisation studies the MAH will not include participants of 12-15 years, which is also 
endorsed given the studies objectives and design. One (C4591018, Phase II, US) of the 13 post-
authorisation studies stated in the RMP was not presented by the MAH. However, this study will include 
immunocompromised adults with autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, so the request was not 
applicable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication (section 4.1) as follows: 
“Comirnaty is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 
virus, in individuals 16 12 years of age and older.”  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 73/81 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have also been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product is described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC). 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation with additional target patient groups for the new indication applied, on the 
package leaflet has been performed. Since no major text changes has been added, except for change 
of age, this has been found acceptable. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which 
appeared in the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, 
causing WHO to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus infects primarily the airways and 
causes a broad spectrum of respiratory infections from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the 
outbreak.  
Covid-19 in adolescents is mostly a mild disease. Severe cases occur rarely, and predominantly in 
subjects with underlying conditions.  
The applicant is seeking an extension of the indication for Comirnaty (BNT162b2) to adolescents 12-15 
years. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no vaccines against Covid-19 approved for the use in adolescents 12-15 years of 
age.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application for extension of the indication to include adolescents 12-15 years of age is based on a 
single pivotal phase 1/2/3 study C4591001. It is an extension of the pivotal efficacy study in adults 
assessed in the initial approval of Comirnaty. 
The phase 3 part of the study was designed to enrol 2,260 participants aged 12-15 years in US 
(randomised 1:1 to BNT162b2 or placebo) to receive BNT162b2 at the dose of 30 µg, given as 2 IM 
injections 21 day apart (same dosing regimen than for adults). In the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, 
the majority of adolescents received dose 2 between 21 to 27 days after dose 1 (65.2% versus 64.6%) 
followed by 14 to 20 days after dose 1 (31.7% versus 32.2%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 74/81 
The primary objective was the assessment of the safety profile. 
Overall efficacy in those above 16 was also a primary objective in the study, while the analysis of 
vaccine efficacy against confirmed symptomatic cases and severe cases of COVID-19 in 12-15 years 
old is considered exploratory objective. The inferential analysis for the 12-15 year olds which was to 
demonstrate non-inferior immune responses in this age cohort, compared to subjects 16-25 years 
from the initial efficacy part of the same study. Almost all (98.3%) of adolescent participants had at 
least 1 month of follow-up after dose 2 and 57.9% had at least 2month of follow-up after dose 2. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Comirnaty was shown to elicit non-inferior immune responses in subjects 12-15 years of age without 
previous Covid-19 compared to subjects 16-25 years in terms of geometric mean titres of neutralising 
antibodies one-month post dose 2.  
Specifically,  responses  in  adolescents  were  superior  to  the  older  age  group,  reflecting  by  greater 
geometric  mean-fold  rise  (GMFR)  of  SARS-CoV-2  50%  serum  neutralizing  titers  in  the  12-15  years 
group (GMFR 118.3 (CI95% 101.4, 137.9)) compared to 16-25 age group (GMFR 71.2 (CI95% 61.3, 
82.7) at 1 month after dose 2). Note that GMFRs were higher in participants who were seronegative at 
baseline compared to those who were positive at baseline (regardless of the age group). 
A high proportion of participants (97.9% of adolescents and 100.0% of young adults) had a ≥4-fold 
rise in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers from before vaccination to 1 month post-dose 2. 
Efficacy  can  be  inferred  for  adolescents  based  on  immune-bridging,  as  neutralising  antibodies  are 
thought to be a major mechanism of protection with Comirnaty.  
In addition to immune responses, efficacy was also studied. Although a limited number of symptomatic 
covid-19 cases occurred in the study, they were all in the placebo group. The efficacy of the vaccine 
(BNT162b2, 2 doses of 30 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 in the adolescents aged 12-
15 years either without or with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurring at least 
7 days after the second  dose, was 100.0%  (CI95% 75.3,  100)  vs VE  was 95.0%  (95%  CI:  90.3%, 
97.6%) respectively). No severe cases occurred in adolescents. 
The vaccine efficacy after one dose was 100% (CI95% 41.4, 100) from 11 days after dose 1 to before 
dose 2. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Specific risk groups among adolescents, including those immunosuppressed, or otherwise with risk of 
more severe disease due to underlying conditions, were not specifically studied.  A study in 
immunocompromised children is included in the PIP.  
It is currently unknown to what extent vaccination provides protection against asymptomatic infection, 
and whether vaccination prevents further transmission. The efficacy of the vaccine in preventing SARS-
CoV-2 shedding and transmission should be evaluated post-authorisation, as was planned for adults 
(through seroconversion of N-binding antibody in BNT162b2 and placebo recipients who did not 
experience COVID-19). 
The duration of protection is unknown in adolescents, as well as among adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 75/81 
The long-term efficacy in adolescents aged 12-15 years is unknown. Indeed, the available data on the 
efficacy against COVID-19 occurring 7 days after post-dose 2 are limited in term of follow-up (95.7% 
of adolescents were followed less than 3 months post-dose 2). As for subjects 16 years of age and 
older, the assessment of the VE over a period of at least 6 months is expected to determine the need 
and the appropriate time of a booster dose. Based on higher immune response in 12-15 years group 
compared to 16-25 years group, a comparable duration of protection is expected in adolescents. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Comirnaty administered to adolescent subjects aged 12-15 years has been evaluated in a 
total of 2260 (BNT162b n=1131; placebo n=1129) adolescents subjects which have subsequently been 
recruited to the ongoing phase 3 study (C4591001). The same dose (30µg) and dose regimen as for 
adult subjects have been used in the study.  
At the time of the analysis of the adolescent population aged 12-15 years (data up to the cut-off date 
of 13 March 2021), a total of 1,308 (n=660 Comirnaty; n=648 placebo) adolescent subjects were 
evaluated for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. 
Regarding reactogenicity, the most frequent adverse reactions in adolescent participant aged 12-15 
years was pain at the injection site (86% dose1; 79% dose2), fatigue (60% dose1; 66% dose2), 
headache (55% dose1; 65% dose2), chills (28% dose1; 42% dose2), muscle pain (24% dose1; 32% 
dose2), joint pain (10% dose1; 16% dose2) and fever (10% dose1; 20% dose2). Vomiting and 
diarrhoea was reported infrequently after both doses.  
Most of the local and systemic events resolved within 3 days and were mild to moderate at intensity. 
The reactogenicity profile is similar to what has been reported in adult subjects, but the frequency 
appears in general to be slightly higher. The SmPC has been updated to describe the frequency of the 
most reported local and systemic events in adolescents, which is endorsed. 
The frequency of AEs and SAEs was in general low and no new safety concerns have been detected 
compared to what was reported for the adult population. A few vaccine related events of 
lymphadenopathy (BNT162b2 0.8% (9 cases); placebo 0.2% (2 cases)) have been reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is a limited number of adolescent subjects aged 12-15 years included in the study, which does 
not allow detection of rare adverse events. A reassuring number of adult subjects has been exposed to 
the vaccine (>300 million) without any serious, emerging safety issues. However, if any rare adverse 
events were to occur specifically or more commonly in adolescent subjects compared to adults, it 
would not be possible to detect these in this study.  
Long term safety data for adolescent subjects are not available at this stage, however the Phase 2/3 
study will follow the included subjects up to 2 years post vaccination, so these data are expected post-
authorisation. 
Limited information is available on use in frail adolescent subjects due to the small study size. 
Limited information is available on use in seropositive adolescent subjects due to the small study size. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 76/81 
There is an ongoing PRAC review of cases of ‘myocarditis/pericarditis’, which have been observed in 
the post-authorization phase, mainly in adult males below the age of 30. Two such events were 
reported in the clinical trials, one in a subject receiving Comirnaty (a 65+ year old male) and one in a 
placebo recipient. Consequently, this is presumed to be a rare event. A reliable frequency estimate is 
not available, and the impact of age on this possible risk is not understood. Causality has presently not 
been established.  
This safety is being assessed by PRAC, via the monthly safety summary reports (MSSRs) for

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of Comirnaty in adolescents 12-15 years of age has been clearly demonstrated in terms of 
bridging via neutralising antibody titers, as well as protection against symptomatic disease. The known 
unfavourable effects are considered acceptable in terms of reactogenicity, which occurred at a slightly 
higher frequency compared to the adult population that was evaluated in a previous application. No 
new safety concerns were observed; however, the study size did not allow detection of rare adverse 
events.  
The CHMP noted that there is an ongoing PRAC review of cases of ‘myocarditis/pericarditis’, which have 
been observed in the post-authorization phase, mainly in adult males below the age of 30. Two such 
events were reported in the clinical trials, one in a subject receiving Comirnaty (a 65+ year old male) 
and one in a placebo recipient. Consequently, this is presumed to be a rare event. A reliable frequency 
estimate is not available, and the impact of age on this possible risk is not understood. Causality has 
presently not been established.  
Notwithstanding this uncertainty, the B/R balance in the sought indication is considered positive, 
particularly in adolescent people with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID 19. No 
statements in the product information are warranted. 
This safety is being assessed by PRAC, via the monthly safety summary reports (MSSRs) for 
Comirnaty. The outcome of the current variation to extend to 12 to 15 years old is without prejudice to 
the outcome of the review of this safety topic at PRAC and any conclusions from such review. The 
result of this, including any potential recommendations for the terms of the marketing authorisation 
will be appropriately implemented.  
The following identified uncertainties should be adequately addressed post-authorisation: the long-
term efficacy and the duration of protection conveyed by the vaccine, the efficacy on asymptomatic 
infection, the efficacy in special groups among adolescents. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated benefits outweigh the identified risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Comirnaty is considered positive in adolescent subjects aged 12-15 years. 
4.  Recommendations
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

I and IIIB 
Extension of the existing indication from "individuals 16 years of age and older" to "individuals 12 
years of age and older" for Comirnaty; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0179/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1). 
5. EPAR changes
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above. 
Summary 
The application for extension of the indication to include adolescents 12-15 years of age is based on a 
single pivotal phase 1/2/3 study C4591001. It is an extension of the pivotal efficacy study in adults 
assessed in the initial approval of Comirnaty. The inferential analysis for the 12-15 year olds which was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282047/2021 Rev.1 
Page 80/81 
to demonstrate non-inferior immune responses in this age cohort, compared to subjects 16-25 years 
from the initial efficacy part of the same study.  
The effects of Comirnaty in children were investigated in 2,260 children aged 12 to 15 years. The trial 
showed that the immune response to Comirnaty in this group was comparable to the immune response 
in the 16 to 25 age group. The efficacy of Comirnaty was calculated in close to 2,000 children from 12 
to 15 years of age who had no sign of previous infection. These received either the vaccine or a 
placebo. Of the 1,005 children receiving the vaccine, none developed COVID-19 compared to 16 
children out of the 978 who received the placebo. This means that, in this study, the vaccine was 
100% effective at preventing COVID-19 (although the true rate could be between 75% and 100%). 
The most common side effects in children aged 12 to 15 are similar to those in people aged 16 and 
above. They include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and 
fever. These effects are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days from the vaccination. 
The CHMP concluded that the benefits of Comirnaty in this age group outweigh the risks. 
The CHMP also noted that due to the limited number of children included in the study, the trial could 
not have detected rare side effects. The committee also noted that EMA’s safety committee PRAC is 
currently assessing very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that occurred after vaccination with 
Comirnaty, mainly in people under 30 years of age. Currently there is no indication that these cases 
are due to the vaccine and EMA is closely monitoring this issue. 
Despite this uncertainty, the CHMP considered that benefits of Comirnaty in children aged 12 to 15 
outweigh the risks, in particular in children with conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.

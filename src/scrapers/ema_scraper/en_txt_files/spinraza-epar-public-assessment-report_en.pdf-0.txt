2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition, Epidemiology and risk factors, screening 
tools/prevention 
The applicant proposed the following wording for the product indication: 
“Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).” 
SMA  is  an  autosomal  recessive  neuromuscular  disease  characterized  by  degeneration  of  the  motor 
neurons  in  the  anterior  horn  of  the  spinal  cord,  resulting  in  atrophy  of  the  voluntary  muscles  of  the 
limbs and trunk. 
SMA diagnosis is suspected when a patient presents with flaccid muscle weakness. Genetic diagnosis 
is  the  most  common  form  of  diagnosis,  which  allows  for  premorbid  diagnosis  in  siblings  where  one 
previously affected member has been identified. 
SMA is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular serious, debilitating, and life-threatening rare disease, 
with  a  global  incidence  of  8.5  to  10.3  per  100,000  live  births  characterized  by  degeneration  of  the 
motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, resulting in atrophy of the voluntary muscles of 
the limbs and trunk.Historically, SMA has been categorized into Types 0, I, II, III, and IV which range 
in severity from babies who are born with severe impairment and die within weeks of birth (Type 0) to 
disease  which  manifests  in  adult  life  with  proximal  muscle  weakness  (Type  IV).  The  most  common 
variants  (Types  I,  II  and  III)  all  present  with  a  pre-symptomatic  period  and  can  be  classified 
prospectively based on age of symptom onset and SMN2 gene copy number as infantile-onset (closely 
resembling Type I) and later-onset (Type II and III).

Current  medical  care  is  supportive,  focused  on  respiratory  support,  nutritional  support,  and 
management of resulting musculotendinous contractures and neuromuscular scoliosis through bracing, 
physical  therapy,  and  surgery  (Wang  2007).  As  there  are  currently  no  approved  therapies  for  the 
treatment of SMA, a significant unmet clinical need exists for these patients. 
2.1.2.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SMA  is  a  result  of  reduced  levels  of  the  SMN  protein,  caused  by  homozygous  deletions  and, 
infrequently,  by  mutations  within  the  SMN1  gene.  The  lack  of  SMN  protein  causes  dysfunction  and 
eventually  death  of  motor  neurons.  Despite  being  a  rare  disorder,  SMA  is  the  most  common  genetic 
cause  of  infant  mortality  and  a  major  cause  of  childhood  morbidity  [Pearn  1973a;  Pearn  1973b; 
Sugarman 2012]. 
The SMN1 gene lies in a duplicated, inverted region of the chromosome that includes a nearly identical 
copy of the SMN1 gene, called SMN2. Although both genes encode proteins with identical amino acid 
sequences, SMN2 differs from SMN1 by 5 to 11 nucleotides [Lorson 1999; Monani 1999]. One of these 
nucleotide  differences,  a  cytosine-to-thymine  substitution,  occurs  in  exon  7  of  the  SMN2  gene, 
resulting  in  an  alternative  splicing  pattern  that  favours  skipping  of  exon  7.  Eighty  to  90%  of  the 
transcripts produced from the SMN2 gene lack exon 7 [Cho and Dreyfuss 2010; Wirth 2013], resulting 
in  a  truncated  protein  product  that  is  defective  and  unstable  [Cho  and  Dreyfuss  2010;  Wirth  2013]. 
Increasing  the  amount  of  full-length  transcript  from  the  SMN2  gene  is  predicted  to  result  in  an 
increase in SMN protein in patients with SMA [Hua 2010]. Humans have a variable number of copies 
of  the  SMN2  gene  (0  to  8  copies).  SMN2  copy  number  is  an  important  predictor  of  SMA  disease 
severity, and patients with more copies generally have a less severe form of the disease. Furthermore, 
among  families  with  more  than  one  affected  child,  siblings  with  SMA  have  been  found  to  have  high 
concordance for SMA subtype [Jones 2016; Medrano 2016].

2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
SMA has been categorized into Types 0, I, II, III, and IV based on age of symptom onset and maximal 
achieved motor abilities [Finkel 2015]. In general, symptom onset and severity of SMA correlate with 
SMN2 gene copy number in this genetic disorder [Arnold 2015].

Type 0 or prenatal SMA is a rare type in which infants are born with clinical signs of disease, 
such as major joint contractures and respiratory compromise that often leads to the need for 
mechanical  ventilation  at  or  shortly  after  birth  [Dubowitz  1999;  Finkel  2015;  MacLeod  1999; 
Mercuri  2012].  These  patients  usually  have  1  copy  of  the  SMN2  gene.  Death  or  permanent 
ventilation typically occurs within weeks after birth. 
Type  I  SMA  is  the  most  common  form  of  SMA,  occurring  in  approximately  58%  of  cases 
[Ogino 2004]. Patients with Type I SMA usually have 2 or 3 copies of the SMN2 gene, with 2 
copies  of  the  SMN2  gene  as  the  most  common  genotype  [Feldkötter  2002].  Symptom  onset 
occurs  within  the  first  6  months  of  life.  The  earlier  the  symptom  onset,  the  worse  the 
prognosis  [Thomas  and  Dubowitz  1994].  SMA  Type  I  can  be  further  divided  into  subtypes 
based on age of symptom onset: Patients with Type IA SMA have symptom onset in utero and 
are  diagnosed  within  the  first  2  weeks  of  birth;  patients  with  Type  IB  SMA  have  symptom 
onset  during  infancy  and  are  diagnosed  by  3  months  of  age;  and  patients  with  Type  IC  SMA 
have symptom onset during infancy and are diagnosed between 3 and 6 months of age [Finkel 
2015]. 
Type II SMA represents approximately 29% of SMA cases [Ogino 2004]. Patients with Type II 
SMA usually have 3 copies of the SMN2 gene, but this can vary from 2 to 4 copies [Feldkötter 
2002].  Symptom  onset  occurs  after  6  months  but  before  2  years  of  age.  Patients  have  a 
reduced life expectancy, ranging from 2 years to more than 40 years of age [Faravelli 2015]. 
Type III SMA occurs in approximately 13% of cases [Ogino 2004]. Patients with Type III SMA 
usually  have  3  or  4  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene  [Feldkötter  2002].  Patients  with  Type  III  SMA 
generally  have  a  normal  life  expectancy  [Arnold  2015;  Wang  2007].  SMA  Type  III  can  be 
further  divided  into  Type  IIIA  (diagnosed  at  18-36  months;  patients  walk  but  never  run  or 
jump well) and Type IIIB (diagnosed at 3-10 years; patients are able to walk, run, jump, and 
participate in sports) [Finkel 2015]. 
• 
Type  IV  SMA  (adult-onset  SMA)  is  the  mildest  form  of  SMA  and  occurs  in  <5%  of  the  cases 
[Arnold  2015].  Patients  with  Type  IV  SMA  usually  have  4  or  more  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene. 
Patients are ambulatory, and their life expectancy is normal [Faravelli 2015]. 
The definition of SMA types as described by Finkel et al was used in the clinical development program 
for  nusinersen  [Finkel  2015].  The  studies  of  nusinersen  included  genetically  diagnosed  subjects  with 
infantile-onset  (Type  I)  SMA,  presymptomatic  SMA  (Type  I  or  Type  II)  and  subjects  with  later-onset 
(Type II and Type III) SMA. 
2.1.4.  Management 
At present there are no SMA specific treatments and only supportive care is provided to patients. 
Management Patients with SMA have an urgent unmet need as no therapy has been approved to date 
that can reverse, delay, or halt the progressive decline in motor function and disability associated with 
all types of SMA. 
A  consensus  statement  for  the  standard  of  care  in  SMA  is  intended  as  a  guideline  for  the  care  of 
patients with SMA [Wang 2007]. For infants with Type I SMA, current medical care is supportive and is 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 10/117 
  
  
 
 
focused  on  respiratory  and  nutritional  support.  Chronic  respiratory  management  includes  providing 
methods  for  airway  clearance,  including  mechanical  insufflation-exsufflation  or  manual  cough  assist 
and  non-invasive  ventilator  support  such  as  bi-level  positive  airway  pressure  (Bi-PAP).  Acute 
respiratory  infections  are often  lifethreatening  for these  patients  and  require these  same  methods  of 
increased  airway  clearance  and  increased  ventilation  support.  Nonetheless,  despite  best  supportive 
efforts,  the  progression  of  respiratory  deficits,  continuous  progression  of  weakness,  and  consequent 
premature death are unavoidable. 
The standard of care for later-onset SMA is dependent on the severity of the disease but may include 
physical  and  occupational  therapy,  nutritional  support,  pain  management,  orthotics,  environmental 
controls and home modifications to facilitate safe mobility, and spinal surgery. 
2.1.5.  About the product 
Nusinersen  or  nusinersen  is  a  2´-O-(2-methoxyethyl)  antisense  oligonucleotide  (ASO)  consisting  of 
18 nucleotides  with  high  specificity  for  the  intron  downstream  of  exon 7  in  the  SMN2  pre-mRNA,  a 
region  of  SMN2  pre-mRNA  normally  occupied  by  heterogeneous  nuclear  ribonucleoproteins  A1/A2 
(hnRNPs) and referred to as intron splicing silencer N1, thus promoting the inclusion of exon 7 in the 
SMN2  mRNA  transcript.  This  region  of  the  SMN2  pre-mRNA  is  present  in  all  patients  with  spinal 
muscular  atrophy  (SMA).  The  therapeutic  approach  to  treat  SMA  patients  is  based  on  increasing  the 
amount of full-length protein produced from the SMN2 gene by modulating its mRNA splicing pattern. 
Nusinersen was designed for intrathecal (IT) chronic administration, independent of clinical phenotype. 
2.1.6.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the unmet medical need as 
currently there are no approved treatments for SMA, the presented therapeutic rationale, and the 
early data available from the development programme, demonstrating that nusinersen has the 
potential to address the need in SMA.

Figure 2. Structural formula of nusinersen sodium. 
The molecular weight, empirical formula, and molecular structure of nusinersen were confirmed by 
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), 
elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and

combustion analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The nucleotide sequence of 
nusinersen was determined by failure sequence analysis (using IP-HPLC-TOF-MS). 
Nusinersen  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  multiple  chiral  centres.The  absolute 
configuration of each pure, commercial available starting materialis well defined and is maintained in 
the  final  active  substance  as  no  racemization  occurs.  Since  the  coupling  reactions  for  the  17 
phosphorothioate  diester  internucleotide  linkages  are  non-stereoespecific,  the  active  substance  is  a 
mixture  of  217  diastereoisomers.    .  Evidence  from  experimental  data  and  literature  were  provided  to 
demonstrate  that  the  diastereoisomeric  composition  of  the  active  substance  remains  constant  from 
batch  to  batch  regardless  of  scale,  when  it  is  manufactured  using  the  proposed  manufacturing 
process.  
The active substance is a white to yellow hygroscopic amorphous solid which is freely soluble in water, 
soluble in methanol and insoluble in acetone, ethanol and acetonitrile. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Nusinersen is a synthetic 2’-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide. It is manufactured in one 
manufacturing site. Its manufacturing process consists of four process stages.  
1.  Solid-phase synthesis (production of crude intermediate):  
2.  Purification  
3.  Final detritylation  
4.  Freeze  drying  (production  of  active  substance):  The  drug  substance  solution  obtained  from 
Step 3 is freeze dried yielding a lyophilized solid nusinersen active substance. 
The commercial batch size for nusinersen active substance is defined as the amount of drug substance 
produced in a single freeze drying run. 
Specifications and control methods for reagents, crude nusinersen, and intermediates isolated 
following synthesis, purification, and detritylation have been established to confirm the manufacturing 
step is successfully controlled and that nusinersen active substance with the intended quality is 
produced. Batch data for the intermediates from multiple batches were provided. Compliance with the 
proposed specification was verified in all cases. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
Holding periods were established for all intermediates based on adequate stability data. No alternate 
processing or reprocessing are to be performed in the production of commercial batches of nusinersen 
active substance. 
The  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  of  nusinersen  directly  impacted  by  manufacturing  parameters 
have been described and the relationships between the steps of the manufacturing process and each 
CQA  have  been  also  indicated.  Other  CQAs  of  the  active  substance,  not  impacted  directly  by  the 
manufacturing process have also been described.  The CQAs are: appearance identity, assay, purity, 
oligonucleotide  impurities:  non-degradation  and  degradation  products,  residual  solvents,  elemental 
impurities, bacterial endotoxins and total aerobic microbial count. 
Process development studies were conducted to determine the critical process parameters (CPPs) that 
impact one or more CQAs of the active substance, and define proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for the 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 13/117 
  
  
 
CPPs.  The ranges reported for all of the CPPs during the process qualification were well within the 
PARs, indicating that the process is consistent and suitably controlled. 
A failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) risk assessment was applied to the manufacturing process, 
procedures,  and  controls  used  in  the  synthesis  of  the  active  substance.  The  risks  at  various  control 
points across the active substance manufacturing process were identified, evaluated and mitigated to 
control  the  risk  to  acceptable  levels.  The  control  strategy  consists  of  control  of  material  attributes, 
control of the CPPs, equipment - including synthesizers, columns, synthesis solid support and column 
packing, and extractables of the solid support and the purification resin, and synthesis parameters - in 
process controls and release testing. The manufacturing process performance will be evaluated for out 
of trend results as part of the continued process verification during the life cycle. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
As mentioned above, nusinersen exhibits stereoisomerism due to the chirality of the phosphorothioate 
backbone.  The  coupling  reactions  employed  in  the  synthesis  of  the  oligonucleotide  are  not 
stereospecific producing a mixture of two stereoisomers at each linkage. The solid phase synthesis can 
thus produce up to 217 diastereoisomers in a reproducible manner. It has been demonstrated that the 
active  substance  steroselectivity  is  under  control  and  the  diasteromeric  distribution  of  nusinersen  is 
reproducible.  
The potential impurities were critically discussed taken in account the maximum dose of Spiranza (12 
mg every 4 months) to calculate the TTC acceptable daily intake limit for individual impurities  and for 
total impurities). The impurities of nusinersen consist of:  
1) impurities derived from starting material and reagents  
2)  process-related  impurities,  namely  process-related  oligonucleotide  impurities  arising  from  side 
reactions  during  the  manufacturing  process  and  by-products  of  the  deprotection  reactions  and 
unwanted side reactions  residual solvents and elemental impurities from the use of equipment; and 
3) degradation products, including process-related oligonucleotide impurities and degradation products 
observed only under forced degradation studies as no evidence of degradation is observed under long-
term or accelerated storage conditions.  
The  qualification  of  oligonucleotide  impurities  was  done  in  the  53-week  repeat  dose  intrathecal 
toxicology  study  in  juvenile  monkeys.  For  all  critical  impurities  the  acceptance  limit  within  the  active 
substance specification is usually well below than the qualification level. 
The  identified  and  the  potential  small  molecule  impurities  of  nusinersen  active  substance  were 
evaluated  in  respect  to  their  potential  genotoxic  risk  as  per  the  ICH  M7  guideline.    Identified  and 
potential residual solvents, are controlled to the PDE values of ICH Q3(R5) guideline. Impurities with 
structures  with  unknown  carcinogenic  and  mutagenic  risks  were  analysed  .  The  risk  assessment 
concluded  that  relevant  solvents  are  adequately  purged  during  downstream  processing.  This  was 
confirmed by batch analysis data. 
Process validation was achieved by assessing the CPPs, CQAs and yield of four batches of crude 
nusinersen intermediate (solid-support synthesis), batches of nusinersen intermediate and three 
batches of nusinersen active substance (freeze drying). These data demonstrate that each unit 
operation and thus the entire process is controlled and can produce active substance in compliance 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 14/117 
  
  
 
with the proposed specification. The yields obtained for each stage of the synthesis of the active 
substance underline the consistency of the manufacturing process. The proposed plan for continued 
process verification is considered adequate. 
The  platform  used  for  the  manufacture  of  nusinersen  was  optimized  and  scaled  up  during 
development.  A  summary  of  the  changes  implemented  and  their  rationale  has  been  presented.  The 
optimization led to the reduction of the levels of various impurities, , and to the consequent increase 
in the overall purity. 
The active substance is stored in a multi-component container closure system. The bags comply with 
the  EU  Commission  Directive  10/2011,  and  specifications  and  certificates  of  analysis  for  them  were 
provided. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (most 
abundant mass: IP-HPLC-UV-MS; sequencing: IP-HPLC-TOF-MS; sodium counterion: ICP-OES), assay 
(IP-HPLC-UV-MS), purity (Full Length n) (IP-HPLC-UV-MS), impurities (IP-HPLC-UV-MS), residual 
solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), sodium acetate (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration test (Ph. Eur.).   
The active substance specification is based on the active substance CQAs: appearance identity, assay, 
purity,  oligonucleotide  impurities:  non-degradation  and  degradation  products,  residual  solvents, 
elemental impurities, bacterial endotoxins and total aerobic microbial count. 
A  justification  for  each  attribute  and  the  respective  acceptance  criteria  in  the  active  substance 
specification was provided. Specification limits are based on ICH requirements, process capability and 
variability,  starting  material  batch  data,  active  substance  and  finished  product  stability  data  and 
analytical control strategies, including those developed for starting materials and reagents.  
A  justification  for  the  omission  of  a  biological  activity  test  on  the  basis  of  the  antisense  mechanism 
and the inclusion of a test to verify the correct nucleotide sequence was provided and accepted. 
Based upon batch analysis and stability data provided the applicant was requested to tighten the limits 
for  some  oligonucleotide  impuritiesand  residual  solvents  These  were  revised  by  the  applicant  taking 
into  consideration  the  data  available  from  production  scale  batches  available  at  the  time  of  opinion, 
representative small-scale batches, process variability and toxicology data.  The applicant committed 
to review the limits for specified, unspecified and total oligonucleotide impurities, and further tighten 
them  as  appropriate,  once  data  from  ten  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  become 
available.  
The  justification  for  only  including  someresidual  solvents  in  the  specification  has  been  provided.  The 
scientific  principles,  fates  and  estimated  purge  factor  knowledge  were  provided  as  a  support  for  not 
testing other solvents in the final active substance according with ICH M7 – Option 4.  
For elemental impurities a risk assessment approach has been performed on drug substance. 
Adequate justifications were provided for the exclusion from the active substance specification of other 
solvents , pH, and deamination control .

Although  sodium  acetate  and  water  content  are  not  CQA,  these  are  used  in  calculations  for  the 
formulation  of  the  finished  product.  Therefore,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  include  these 
parameters in the active substance specification.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards testing has been presented. The reference 
standards, primary and working reference standards, as well as working solution standards have been 
adequately described.  
Batch analysis data on one pilot scale batch (manufactured before optimization of the process) and 
three commercial scale process validation batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
demonstrated compliance with the specifications and consistency in the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Stability data on three primary production scale active substance batches from the proposed 
manufacturer stored  in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 
24 months under long term conditions at -20 ± 5°C and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 5 ± 3°C, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. Data from 3 months storage at 
30 ± 2°C/65 ± 5% RH to simulate temperature excursions were also provided.  
Supportive stability data on one pilot scale batch manufactured by the same process but stored in a 
different container for 60 months at -20°C ± 5°C and 12 months at 5 ± 3°C were also submitted. 
All batches placed on stability are representative of the full scale commercial manufacturing process. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, purity, impurities, microbial enumeration 
test (TAMC and TYMC) and bacterial endotoxins. Deamination (tested by by IP-HPLC with time-of-
flight-MS) and water content (measured by Karl Fischer) were monitored on the primary stability 
batches. However, these attributes are not proposed for the commercial specification. 
All results remained within the proposed specification limits and no significant changes were observed. 
No meaningful trends in assay, purity or impurities occurred over the 24 months at any storage 
condition. Process-related impurities that may also be degradation products were assessed for trends 
at the long term (-20°C), accelerated (5°C) or stressed condition (30°C). Some oligonucleotide 
impurities showed no change over time at accelerated (5°C) or stressed (30°C) conditions, but 
showed a slight increase at the long term storage condition of -20°C in all batches. Nevertheless, no 
impact to the proposed retest period is expected as a result of this minimal increase Deamination was 
tested and not detected at the 6 month time point for the accelerated condition of 5°C and the 3 
month time point for the stressed condition of 30°C. Although water content increased in all batches 
over time in all storage conditions, it was demonstrated that it has no impact on the stability of the 
active substance.  
Forced degradation studies were also conducted on one pilot and one production scale batch. 
Nusinersen was exposed to light, acidic (pH 2), basic (0.1 N NaOH), oxidative (0.03% H2O2) and 
thermal (7 months at 80°C) stress conditions. It was shown that the active substance is susceptible to 
acidic, oxidative, thermal and photolytic conditions. The results of mass balance calculations support 
the stability indicating properties of the analytical method for assay and impurities.  
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 16/117 
  
  
 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B (option 2) was performed on one production 
scale batch. The results obtained indicate that the formation of impurities through photodegradation is 
slow. This slow degradation rate suggests that the short exposure times to lower intensity room 
fluorescent lighting associated with dispensing and drug product manufacturing operations will not 
result in measurable degradation. This is supported by the hold time validation experiments which 
showed no significant differences in oligonucleotide impurities content between batches. Therefore, no 
special precautions to protect nusinersen from light during manufacturing, handling, storage and 
finished product formulation activities are required.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored at 
-20 ± 5°C in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Spinraza  is  a  single  use,  unidose,  sterile,  preservative-free,  clear  and  colourless  isotonic  solution  for 
injection intended for intrathecal administration containing 2.4 mg/ml of nusinersen.  It is supplied in 
aseptically filled single use vials that nominally contain 12 mg of nusinersen. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a single use, sterile, preservative free liquid 
isotonic solution for intrathecal injection containing nusinersen formulated in an artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid  (aCSF),  stable  at  2-8  °C,  packaged  in  Ph.  Eur.  Type  I  glass  vial,  which  meets  pharmacopoeial 
requirements for parenteral dosage forms and product specific requirements. 
Nusinersen is a synthetic oligonucleotide with a molecular weight of 7501 amu. Due to its polyanionic 
nature, nusinersen is freely water soluble at physiologic pH, making it straightforward to formulate in 
aqueous solution. The particle size distribution of the active substance is therefore not critical. 
In  line  with  the  QTPP,  formulation  excipients  were  selected  based  on  the  composition,  pH  and 
electrolyte levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The excipients 
are: sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate and disodium phosphate as buffers to maintain the pH of 
the  drug  product  comparable  to  CSF;  sodium  chloride  to  establish  the  tonicity  of  the  drug  product 
comparable  to  that  of  CSF;  potassium  chloride,  calcium  chloride  dihydrate  and  magnesium  chloride 
hexahydrate as electrolytes, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment and water for 
injection as vehicle. None of the excipients are of human or animal origin. The applicant completed a 
risk  assessment  to  determine  the  potential  sources  of  endotoxin  in  the  manufacturing  process.  All 
excipients are tested to meet the requirements in the applicable Ph. Eur. monograph. While endotoxin 
limits  are  not  included  for  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate  dihydrate,  sodium  phosphate  dibasic  and 
potassium  chloride,  the  risk  associated  with  these  salts  is  low  as  their  concentrations  in  the  final 
finished product are also low. Additionally, raw materials derived from an inorganic origin carry a low 
risk  of  measurable  endotoxin  in  general.  No  endotoxin  specifications  are  provided  for  sodium 
hydroxide  (NaOH)  or  hydrochloric  acid  (HCl).  Given  this  insignificant  contribution  and  the  fact  that 
NaOH  is  often  used  an  agent  for  endotoxin  removal  in  other  processes,  the  risk  of  endotoxin 
introduction from HCl and NaOH is negligible. Based on the results of this assessment and the results 
of endotoxin testing throughout the process validation at both manufacturing sites, additional controls 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 17/117 
  
  
 
 
for  endotoxin  were  deemed  not  necessary.  The  compatibility  of  the  active  substance  with  the 
formulation excipients was demonstrated as part of the stability studies. 
The pharmaceutical development of the nusinersen solution for injection formulation was completed in 
two stages. 
The  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  was  described  in  sufficient  detail.  The  choice  of  the 
sterilisation  method  (sterile  filtration)  was  justified in  line  with  the  decision  trees  for  the  selection  of 
sterilisation methods (CPMP/QWP/054/98).  
Leachables  and  extractables  studies  on  the  container  closure  systems  used  for  holding  the  bulk 
product at the proposed manufacturing sites were also provided. 
Nusinersen 12 mg solution for injection is packaged in an ISO 6R Ph. Eur. type I, clear single-use vial 
sealed with a sealed with a 20-mm fluorinated polymer coated, bromobutyl rubber stopper and capped 
with  a  20-mm  aluminium  over  seal  with  a  plastic  flip  off  cap.  The  vial  contains  a  nominal  volume  of 
5.0  ml  The  specifications,  technical  drawings,  quality  control  information  and  certificates  of  analysis 
for  the  proposed  container  closure  system  are  providedConfirmation  was  provided  that  the  rubber 
stopper material complies with current requirements of Ph Eur and European food regulations. Details 
of depyrogenation and sterilization cycles employed for the primary containers and the vials together 
with the respective validation reports were submitted. Confirmation was provided that the sterilization 
of the rubber stoppers and sterilisation/ depyrogenation of the glass vials meet Ph. Eur. requirements 
(5.1.2). Non-volatile, semi-volatile, volatile and inorganic extractables and leachables were assessed. 
A  risk  assessment  on  the  potential  for  delamination  to  occur  was  conducted  and  concluded  that  the 
risk was low. This was supported by stability data The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  ten  main  steps:  receipt  and storage  of  the  drug  substance  at 
manufacturing  site  (step  0),  temperature  equilibration  of  the  drug  substance  (step  1),  excipient 
dispensing for artificial cerebrospinal fluid preparation (step 2), artificial cerebrospinal fluid preparation 
(step  3),  active  substance  concentrate  preparation  (step  4),  compounding  (step  5),  bioburden 
reduction (step 6), sterilizing filtration (step 7), vial filling, stoppering and crimping (step 8) and 100% 
visual inspection of filled vials (step 9).  
Details  regarding  the  description,  duration  and  holding  times  of  different  steps  of  the  manufacturing 
process  have  been  provided.  The  process  is  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process.  The  validation 
protocol  and  report  of  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  are  provided  for  three 
commercial  scale  batches  manufactured  at  each  of  the  proposed  manufacturing  sites.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(Ph.  Eur.), identification (IP-HPLC-UV-MS), assay, purity and impurities (IP-HPLC-UV-MS), extractable 
volume  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  osmolality  (Ph.  Eur.),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (high voltage leak detection).  
The  specifications  for  Nusinersen  2.4  mg/ml  Solution  for  injection  have  been  established  in  line  with 
the requirements of the Ph Eur monographs, ICH guidelines and batch analysis data. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 18/117 
  
  
 
As  indicated  in  the  active  substance  section,  a  justification  for  not  including  a  biological  activity  test 
based on the antisense mechanism was provided and accepted. 
The  proposed  limits  for  purity,  specified,  unspecified  and  total  degradation  products  in  the  finished 
product  specification  are  the  same  as  those  proposed  for  the  active  substance  since  no  finished 
product  degradation  was  observed  in  the  long  term  stability  studies.  However,  as  indicated  in  the 
active  substance  section,  since  these  limits  are  based  on  a  limited  number  of  commercial  scale 
batches  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  review  and  tighten  them  once  data  from  ten  commercial 
scale  batches  of  active  substance  become  available.  Exclusion  of  deamination  control  has  been 
justified  based  on  available  stability  data,  which  confirm  that    deamination  does  not  proceed  to  any 
measureable extent at the proposed long term storage condition of 5 °C, or during 6 months storage 
at  the  accelerated  condition  of  25  °C/60%  RH,  .  The  absence  of  deamination  control  is  considered 
acceptable. 
A risk assessment for elemental impurities in the finished product was conducted as per ICH Q3D. It 
confirmed  that  elemental  impurities  testing  does  not  need  to  be  included  in  the  finished  product 
specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for ten production scale batches from both manufacturing sites 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release 
specifications, through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  manufactured  at  one  of  the 
proposed manufacturing sites stored under long term conditions for up to 36 months at 5±3ºC / 60% 
RH;  up  to  36  months  at  long  term  condition  of  5±3ºC  /  60%  RH  followed  by  2  weeks  at  30±2°C/ 
65±5%RH; and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25±2°C / 60±5%RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Up  to  six  month  stability  data  at  the  long  term  storage  condition  (5ºC±3°C)  and  three  month  at  
accelerated storage condition (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5%RH) on three commercial scale batches of finished 
product from the other proposed manufacturing site were also provided. 
Supportive  stability  data  from  six  process  validation  batches  (three  from  each  of  the  proposed 
manufacturing  sites)  stored  for  12  months  or  3  months  at  5±3ºC  /  60%  RH,  and  9  months    or  3 
months at 25±2°C/ 60±5%RH, respectively were also presented. 
The finished product batches are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  purity,  specified  degradation  products,  unspecified 
degradation  products,  total  degradation  products,  pH,  particulate  matter,  bacterial  endotoxins, 
sterility,  container  closure  integrity  testing  and  deamination.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability indicating. 
All  samples  complied  with  the  specification  at  all time  points.  No  meaningful  changes  were  observed 
for  any  product  quality  attributes  after  storage  at  long  term  or  accelerated  conditions.  The  data 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 19/117 
  
  
 
obtained  through  36  months  at  the  long  term  storage  condition  and  6  months  at  the  accelerated 
condition confirm that deamination does not occur to any measurable extent. The accelerated stability 
data  show  no  meaningful  changes  in  any  attribute  when  drug  product  is  exposed  to  temperature 
excursions up to 25°C (e.g., during shipping) or when the drug product is stored long term at 5 ± 3°C 
followed by up to 14 days up to 30 °C. 
The  release  (T=0)  and  6  month  stability  data  from  the  proposed  manufacturing  sites  was  evaluated 
and considered comparable.  
Data  to  support  the  storage  of  the  finished  product  outside  of  2-8°C  for  two  weeks  has  been 
presented.  It  included:  i) 36  months  of  real  time  stability  data  at  the  2-8°C  followed  by  2  weeks  at 
30±2°C/65±5%RH  storage  condition,  ii)  6  months  of  real  time  stability  data  at  the  accelerated 
storage  condition  of  25±2°C/60±5%RH  for  the  primary  (registration)  batches,    iii)  9  months  of  real 
time  stability  data  at  the  accelerated  storage  condition  of  25±2°C/60±5%RH  for  the  process 
validation batches manufactured at one of the proposed manufacturing sites, and iv) 3 months of real 
time  stability  data  at  the  accelerated  storage  condition  of  25±2°C/60±5%RH  for  the  process 
validation batches manufactured at other manufacturing site. 
A  confirmation  of  compliance  with  CPMP/QWP/072/96  regarding  start  of  shelf  life  of  the  finished 
product has been presented. 
In addition, the applicant conducted a study to evaluate the impact of exposure to room temperature 
and  light  on  the  finished  product  prior  to  administration.  Unopened  vials  removed  from  the  outer 
carton  were  exposed  taken  out  from  the  refrigerator  for  six  hours  six  times.  The  cumulative  time 
outside of secondary package and refrigeration was not less than 36 hours. Minor or no changes in the 
quality  attributes  of  the  finishes  products  were  observed.  Therefore  it  was  concluded  that  prior  to 
administration,  unopened  vials  of  Spinraza  can  be  removed  from  and  returned  to  the  refrigerator  if 
necessary. If removed from the original carton, the total combined time out of refrigeration should not 
exceed 30 hours, at temperature that does not exceed 25°C. 
Forced  thermal  degradation  and  photo  degradation  studies  designed  to  determine  degradation 
pathways,  structures  of  degradation  products  and  the  inherent  stability  of  the  finished  product  were 
conducted on three batches.  Samples were tested for assay, purity, and degradation products by IP-
HPLC-UV-MS  and  for  deamination  by  IP-HPLC-TOF-MS.  The  results  indicated  that  the  product 
degrades  to  a  variety  of  components  under  stressed  conditions.  Based  on  the  stability  data,  none  of 
these  impurities  are  expected  to  be  formed  (or  increase  in  the  case  of  process-related  impurities)  in 
the  finished  product  stored  at  the  long  term  or  accelerated  conditions.  In  addition,  a  photostability 
study  has  been  performed  on  one  production  scale  batch  of  Nusinersen  12  mg  solution  for  injection 
according  to  ICH  Q1B  (option  2)  guideline.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  particulate  matter, 
assay,  purity,  specified  degradation  products,  unspecified  degradation  products,  total  degradation 
products  and  deamination.  Minimal  degradation  was  observed.  Exposure  did  not  alter  drug  product 
appearance  or  resulted  in  an  increase  in  particulate  matter.  Drug  product  stored  in  vials  contained 
within paperboard boxes did not degrade. The results indicate that the degradation rates are slow and 
special  precautions  to  protect  the  product  during  normal  handling,  for  example,  during  drug  product 
manufacture, are not required. However, for the long term, it is recommended that drug product vials 
are stored protected from light in secondary packaging. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months  stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 
8°C)  and  in  the  outer  carton  in  order  to  protect  from  light  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3)  are 
CHMP Assessment report

acceptable.  However,  since  no  degradation  was  observed  under  accelerated  conditions  at  25±2°C  / 
60±5%RH,  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  further  explore  the  possibility  to  store  the  product  at 
ambient temperature post-approval and revise the storage conditions if appropriate. 
If no refrigeration is available, Spinraza may be stored in its original carton, protected from light at or 
below 30°C for up to 14 days. 
Prior  to  administration,  unopened  vials  of  Spinraza  can  be  removed  from  and  returned  to  the 
refrigerator  if  necessary. If  removed  from  the  original  carton,  the  total  combined  time  out  of 
refrigeration should not exceed 30 hours, at a temperature that does not exceed 25°C. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Nusinersen is a uniformly modified 2’-O-(2-methoxyethyl) phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide 
consisting of 18 nucleotide residues. The finished product is a solution for injection for intrathecal 
administration. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Although, the active substance and 
finished product are in general adequately controlled by the proposed specifications, the applicant is 
recommended to review and tighten the limits for specified, unspecified and total oligonucleotide 
impurities in both the active substance and finished product specification when data from ten 
commercial scale batches of the active substance become available. 
The finished product is manufactured by sterile filtration followed by aseptic filling. Since this is a non-
standard manufacturing process, process validation data were presented in the dossier to demonstrate 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months  stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 
8°C) and in the outer carton in order to protect from light are acceptable. However, since no 
degradation was observed under accelerated conditions at 25±2°C / 60±5%RH, the applicant is 
recommended to further explore the possibility to store the product at ambient temperature post-
approval and revise the storage conditions if appropriate. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-The applicant is recommended to review and tighten the limits for specified, unspecified and total 
oligonucleotide impurities in both the active substance and finished product specification when data 
from ten commercial scale batches of active substance become available  
-The applicant is recommended to further explore the possibility to store the product at ambient 
temperature post-approval and revise the storage conditions if appropriate. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program for nusinersen (ISIS 396443) consisted of studies to evaluate the 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and tissue distribution, and nonclinical toxicology safety (off 
target) of nusinersen.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Humans are the only species known to have the SMN2 gene; therefore, the preclinical pharmacological 
effects of nusinersen can only be studied in genetically modified animal models or human cells. The 
field has developed several different mouse models of SMA ranging in phenotypic severity. The 
general approach has been to use genetic engineering to remove the endogenous mouse gene and 
add various numbers of copies of the human SMN2 gene. Those models with more copies of the SMN2 
gene typically have milder phenotypes than those with fewer copies. The pharmacological properties 
of nusinersen were assessed in multiple models with varying degrees of phenotypic severity. For 
PK/PD relationships, a mild model expressing 4 copies of the human SMN2 gene was used (Hsieh-LI 
2000). The use of the mild model to assess PK/PD relationships minimized potential complications 
associated with the rapid deterioration and morbidity found in the severe models. Mouse models with 
more severe phenotypes were used to assess efficacy of nusinersen. 
As common laboratory animal species (mice, rats, dogs, macaques) used in toxicity studies lack the 
SMN2 gene, it was not feasible to evaluate the toxicity of nusinersen in a pharmacologically responsive 
species. However, since the consequence of modulating splicing of the SMN2 transcript is increased 
production of the full-length SMN protein, which is already produced in healthy subjects and at 
insufficient levels in SMA patients, the on-target safety risk is minimal. Thus, the toxicity assessment 
was focused on non-pharmacologic effects related to exposure to nusinersen.  
Although toxicology studies were conducted in several species (CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley Rats, New 
Zealand White rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys), the cynomolgus monkey was chosen as the species 
for repeat-dose IT toxicology studies as it was considered that the ability to repeatedly administer the 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 22/117 
  
  
 
 
 
drug in a clinically relevant manner (IT dosing) in monkeys provides the most relevant safety and 
exposure information for IT dosing in patients.  
Conducting a sub-chronic or chronic repeat-dose toxicology study in rodents using IT bolus dosing was 
not technically feasible. Thus, a 13-week repeat-dose toxicology study was conducted in juvenile CD-1 
mice using SC dosing to obtain maximum systemic exposure and to support treatment of pediatric 
patients. Rats were used for a safety pharmacology study, but the method of administration was 
continuous IT infusion into the lumbar region, at a slow rate (0.25 µL/hour over 25 days and up to 0.2 
mg/day). Reproductive studies were conducted in mice (fertility and developmental toxicity) and in 
rabbits (embryo-fetal development) using SC dosing to provide maximum systemic exposure. 
Conclusions on pharmacology 
The results from the nonclinical pharmacology studies described above demonstrate that nusinersen 
can modulate the splicing of SMN2 to produce an mRNA capable of encoding full length SMN protein. 
In non-clinical species possessing the human SMN2 transgene, nusinersen is capable of inducing 
sufficient SMN expression to significantly improve the life span and function of engineered mouse 
models. This activity supports its potential use in individuals with SMA caused by loss of SMN1. 
Safety pharmacology parameters were evaluated in the 14-week and 53-week toxicity studies in 
monkeys and also in rats receiving 25 days of continuous IT infusion of the test article. There was no 
sustained effect of nusinersen on safety pharmacology parameters from any of these studies. The only 
observations were transient changes in lower spinal reflex following IT slow bolus administration of 
doses ≥3 mg. The safety pharmacology supports the dose levels used in the clinical program. 
Considering the specific binding and unique mechanism of action of nusinersen, no secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies were performed, which 
was considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics of nusinersen were characterized in CSF, plasma, and tissues from 
single and repeat-dose toxicology/PK studies in monkeys using IT administration. Plasma and tissue 
concentrations were evaluated from reproductive studies in mice and rabbits following SC bolus dose 
administration.  
Results were obtained from 4 separate in vivo studies in monkeys as follows:  
•  A non-GLP multiple dose toxicity/PK study in adult  cynomolgus monkeys (Study 396443-
APK01) 
•  A GLP single-dose IT toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 396443-AS01)  
•  A GLP 14-week IT toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys (Study 396443AS03) 
•  A GLP 53-week IT toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys (Study 396443AS06) 
Absorption  
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 23/117 
  
  
 
 
By bypassing the blood-brain-barrier, IT injection of nusinersen into the CSF allows the drug to be 
fully available to the target CNS tissues without an initial absorption process. nusinersen administered 
via IT injection rapidly distributes throughout the CSF space with uptake into CNS tissues with little 
metabolic clearance in the CNS prior to eventual transfer into the systemic circulation via CSF 
turnover. Plasma exposure of nusinersen was approximately 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than 
CSF exposure. 
Distribution 
Multiple-Dose PK Study in Monkeys (Study 396443-APK01) 
A comprehensive PK study was conducted utilizing adult male monkeys dosed IT and IV.  In the 4-
week multiple dose study, cynomolgus monkeys received either four IT lumbar doses (17 male 
monkeys), administered via an implanted lumbar catheter, or four IV bolus doses (3 male monkeys) 
at 1 mg/dose on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.  Both CSF and plasma concentrations exhibited multiphasic 
disposition following IT administration, with a rapid distribution phase followed by slower and 
prolonged elimination (post-distribution) phase(s) in the same manner as observed after a single IT 
dose.  The terminal elimination half-life from CSF was 102 days.  Peak CSF concentrations occurred 1 
hour (the first evaluated time point) following IT injection, while plasma concentrations peaked 4 
hours after the IT bolus injection.  While a substantial distribution advantage in the spinal cord and 
brain tissues was achieved following direct IT administration, a comparison of plasma exposure after 
IT and IV administration suggests minimal metabolic clearance of nusinersen in the CNS prior to 
eventual transfer from the CNS to the systemic circulation. 
Following the last dose on Study Day 22, animals dosed IT were sacrificed on Study Days 29, 85, 183, 
253 and 365. nusinersen was slowly cleared from CNS tissues with terminal elimination half-lives for 
various brain and spinal cord regions ranging from 74 to 275 days with a median value of 116 days.  
14-Week  (396443-AS03)  and  53-Week  (396443-AS06)  Repeat-Dose  Toxicology  Studies  in 
Juvenile Monkeys 
CSF, plasma, and tissue concentrations from the 14-week and 53-week toxicology studies in juvenile 
monkeys were consistent with the pattern established in the 4-week multiple dose PK study. CSF and 
plasma concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner in both studies. The CSF elimination 
half-life determined in AS06 was 111 days, which is consistent with the elimination half-life in CSF 
determined from the multiple-dose PK study. CSF measurements were taken 7 days following IT dose 
administration, so CSF concentrations were well below their expected peak values and were consistent 
with Day 7 CSF values from the single-dose IT study. Consistent with previous studies, the plasma 
Tmax occurred approximately 2 to 5 hours after IT bolus administration.  
Tissue concentrations were measured for CNS tissues, and consistent values were obtained between 
the 14-week and 53-week studies after adjusting for the difference in dosing regimens.  The dosing 
regimens differed between the two studies as follows:  In the 14-week study, animals dosed at 0.3 
and 1 mg received 5 weekly loading doses (SD 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29) followed by biweekly maintenance 
doses (SD 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99) while animals dosed at 3 mg received 15 weekly IT doses.  In the 
53-week study, all animals received 5 weekly loading doses (SD 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29) followed by 
maintenance doses every 6 weeks (SD 71, 113, 155, 197, 239, 281, 323 and 365).  
Dosing frequencies in both of these toxicology studies were more frequent than the clinical study and 
proposed dosing regimen. Thus, the extrapolation of dose exposure in monkeys to humans took into 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 24/117 
  
  
 
consideration the difference in CSF volume between species and dose regimen to calculate safety 
margins. 
PK studies established a consistent pattern of distribution and uptake of nusinersen into the critical 
spinal cord and brain regions needed for pharmacology following IT administration. The long 
elimination half-lives from multiple-dose PK and repeat-dose toxicology studies support a long dosing 
interval for IT drug administration to SMA patients. 
Metabolism  
Nusinersen is metabolized slowly and predominantly via exonuclease mediated hydrolysis (3´ and 5´ 
exonucleases). Nusinersen is not expected to be a substrate for CYP450mediated oxidative 
metabolism. While intact nusinersen was the most abundant ASO detected in monkey tissues, it is 
noted that the drug-related 17-mer oligonucleotide (N-1 from the 3´end) was detected in a relative 
abundance of more than 15%. It is scientifically well established that shorter oligonucleotides less 
efficiently hybridize with their target sequence because the resulting lower melting temperature (Tm) 
renders the interaction of the hybrid thermodynamically less. Accordingly, the 17-mer metabolite 
should less effectively interact with the target sequence compared to the parent oligonucleotide. 
Based on comprehensive in silico analyses by the Applicant, the potential for interaction of parent 
substance and 17-mer metabolite with “off-target”-sequences is also low, particularly because these 
“off-target”-mRNAs would have to be transcribed in the same temporal and site-specific manner. 
Moreover, the sequence of the 17-mer metabolite is in antisense orientation like in the parent 
oligonucleotide, which excludes duplex formation of parent substance and metabolite. For this reason, 
it is accepted that the 17-mer metabolite can neither reduce, nor antagonise the pharmacodynamic 
effect of the parent oligonucleotide. 
Excretion 
Nonclinical  urinary  excretion  evaluation  of  nusinersen has  not  been  conducted.    The  chain shortened 
oligonucleotides  are  expected  to  be  excreted  in  urine  following  slow  metabolism  in  tissues  which 
represents the  major  pathway  for  whole  body  clearance  of  these  compounds  and  thus  also  expected 
for nusinersen (Geary 2003). The absence of excretion studies was considered acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The potential for nusinersen to have drug-drug interactions is low. While nusinersen is highly bound to 
plasma proteins, the binding sites of ASOs (hydrophilic) differ from the binding sites for small 
molecule hydrophobic drugs. Thus, the likelihood of drug-drug interactions due to competition with 
plasma protein binding is low. Nusinersen is not a substrate or inhibitor of a variety of human 
transporters (Study ISIS 396443-IS12) and is unlikely to interact with other drugs due to competition 
or inhibition of the transporters. The metabolites of nusinersen observed in CSF, plasma and tissues 
are consistent with slow and predominantly exonuclease mediated hydrolysis. Based on previous 
experience (Geary 2008, Yu 2007), nusinersen is not expected to be a substrate for CYP450-mediated 
oxidative metabolism. In addition, in vitro studies with cultured cryopreserved human primary 
hepatocytes have demonstrated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of major CYP450-
mediated oxidative metabolism (Studies ISIS 396443-IS13 and ISIS 396443-IS14) and therefore 
should not compete with other drugs for this metabolic pathway.

Conclusions on pharmacokinetics 
Nusinersen administered via IT injection rapidly distributes throughout the CSF space with uptake into 
CNS tissues followed by transfer to systemic circulation via CSF turnover. Plasma concentrations 
remain well-below CSF concentrations following IT administration. The estimated CSF terminal 
elimination half-life is 102 to 111 days in adult and juvenile monkeys. CSF concentrations seemed to 
be in equilibrium with CNS tissue concentration as terminal elimination half-lives from CNS tissues 
ranged from 116 to 174 days.  
The long elimination half-lives from multiple-dose PK and repeat-dose toxicology studies support a 
prolonged dosing interval for IT administration in SMA patients. The concentrations measured in the 
CNS tissues in the toxicology studies exceeded the expected efficacious range (2 to 10 μg/g) 
confirming that the toxicology studies had been dosed high enough to provide appropriate safety 
margins in support of the clinical studies. 
The chain shortened oligonucleotides are expected to be excreted in urine following slow metabolism 
in tissues which represents the major pathway for whole body clearance of these compounds and thus 
also expected for nusinersen. 
The potential for nusinersen to have drug-drug interactions is low. 
Nusinersen is metabolized slowly and predominantly via exonuclease mediated hydrolysis (3´ and 5´ 
exonucleases). Nusinersen is not expected to be a substrate for CYP450mediated oxidative 
metabolism.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicology  program  for  nusinersen  was  designed  by  the  applicant  to  support  chronic  IT 
administration for treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).  
The route of administration for the core repeat-dose toxicity studies was a slow IT bolus injection into 
the  lumbar  space,  which  matches  the  route  of  administration  used  in  the  clinical  program.  The 
reproductive  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  rabbits  used  SC  dose  administration  to  ensure  maximum 
systemic exposure of the adult animals and fetuses to nusinersen. 
Nusinersen was well tolerated in single and repeat-dose studies in monkeys except for acute, transient 
deficits in lower spinal cord reflexes at the highest doses tested. There was no mortality and no effects 
on  body  weight,  food  consumption  or  persistent  clinical  observations.  The  acute  transient  deficits  in 
lower  spinal  cord  reflexes  occurred  only  at  the  highest  dose  levels  tested  (7  mg  in  the  single-dose 
study,  3  mg  in  the  14-week  study,  4  mg  in  the  53-week  study,  and  at  5  mg  in  the  6-week 
investigational study). These effects were observed within several hours post-dose, resolved generally 
within 48 hours post-dose and did not seem to progress with repeated administration.  
A 13-week toxicity study was conducted in juvenile CD-1 mice using SC dose administration to provide 
additional safety data related to systemic exposure margins for use of nusinersen in pediatric patients. 
SC  dosing  was  initiated  on  postnatal  day  (PND)  4  and  occurred  once  weekly  for  4  weeks  (PND  4 
through PND 25) and then every other week until the final dose on PND 95. Dose levels were vehicle, 
1, 10, and 50 mg/kg/dose. Nusinersen was well tolerated at all dose levels. There were no effects on 
morbidity,  mortality,  clinical  findings,  body  weights,  food  consumption,  ophthalmic  examinations, 
hematology, clinical chemistry, or gross findings at necropsy. There were also no apparent effects on 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 26/117 
  
  
 
 
growth  or  development.  Test  article-related  histopathologic  findings  were  seen  at  50  mg/kg  in  male 
liver (Kupffer cell hypertrophy) and in male and female lymph nodes (vacuolated macrophages), which 
correlated  with  higher  organ  weights  for  those  2  tissues.  Higher  spleen  weights  were  seen  at  10 
mg/kg  in  males  and  at  50  mg/kg  in  males  and  females.  The  range  of  effects  observed  in  juvenile 
animals  was  comparable  to  that  documented  in  adult  animals.  Based  on  these  results,  the  NOAEL 
should  be  10  mg/kg  and  is  still  well  above  the  human  equivalent  dose  (0.6  to  2  mg/kg)  used in  the 
maintenance phase of the clinical studies (IT administration every 4 months).  
In the 14- and 53-week studies in the monkey, physical examinations, clinical pathology evaluations, 
ophthalmic examinations, cardiovascular evaluations, maturation of the skeletal system, and immune 
system  parameters  were  within  normal  limits  for  animals  this  age.  There  were  also  no  effects  on 
systemic organ pathology. Although nusinersen was detected in liver and kidney, the absence of any 
treatment  related  findings  is  consistent  with  the  relatively  low  concentrations  in  liver  (<120  μg/g  at 
the  highest  doses  tested  by  IT)  compared  to  the  threshold  for  concentration  in  monkey  liver  in 
systemic administration toxicity studies (>1000 μg/g) for other compounds (Henry 2008). There were 
no treatment-related effects on neurobehavioral or learning parameters.  
Microscopic  changes  associated  with  administration  of  nusinersen  were  limited  to  the  inferior 
hippocampal  region  of  the  brain,  where  the  primary  finding  was  minimal  to  mild  focal  neuronal 
vacuolation. This alteration appears to be related to histological fixation and sample preparation in the 
presence  of  formalin.  Hippocampal  vacuolation  was  absent  in  brain  sections  processed  using 
alternative  fixation  methods.  The  incidence  and  severity  of  these  fixation-induced  vacuoles  was 
greatest in the 14-week monkey IT study which had the most intensive dosing schedule (45 mg total 
dose in 14 weeks) and achieved the highest concentrations in lumbar spine and cerebral cortex (169 
and  166  μg/g,  respectively).  Per  the  applicant,  further  support  for  the  lack  of  significance  of  the 
hippocampal  vacuoles  was  provided  by  an  investigational  study  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
using  6  weekly  IT  doses  (Study  396443-AS11).  Based  on  this  investigational  study,  vacuoles  in  the 
hippocampus may not represent an adverse toxicological finding; instead, the observation of vacuoles 
could  be  linked  to  the  method  of  tissue  preservation  and  the  presence  of  ASO  in  endosomes  or 
lysosomes,  like  that  described  in  the  kidney  (Engelhardt,  2016).  The  microscopic  findings  in  repeat 
dose studies in the monkey could be consistent with oligonucleotide uptake and/or cellular activation 
and cytokine production due to pro-inflammatory effects. The consequences of such uptake and of the 
potential  pro-inflammatory  effects  were  discussed  and  substantiated  with  published  evidence  to 
support the reduced risk of long term adverse effects.

In the 14-week study, 1 of 7 high dose group animals also had a necrotic neuron, and in the 53-week 
study, some necrotic non-neuronal cells and cellular debris were observed in one mid- dose male and 
in  3  of  7  high-dose  males.  Based  on  a  5-point  microscopic  severity  grading  scale,  the  hippocampal 
vacuolation  findings  from both  studies  were  mainly slight  (Grade 1)  and  minimal  (Grade  2)  with  one 
mild  (Grade  3).  In  the  opinion  of  the  study  pathologist,  the  histologic  findings  in  the  hippocampus 
were  unlikely  to  cause  any  clinical  signs  or  influence  the  animals’  ability  to  function.  This 
interpretation,  based  on  the  microscopic  severity,  was  supported  by  the  lack  of  effects  on 
neurobehavioral assessments in these animals.  
The  53-week  monkey  study  was  designed  to  achieve  an  intermediate  level  of  exposure  compared to 
the  14-week  study  and  determine  if  there  was  any  progression  or  additional  toxicities  seen  with 
chronic  exposure.  The  total  dose  in  the  first  3  months  of  this  study  was  24  mg,  which  produced 
lumbar spinal cord and cerebral cortex concentrations of 106 and 71 μg/g, respectively. The neuronal 
vacuolation  in  the  inferior  hippocampus  was  present  at  this  level  of  exposure,  but  there  was  no 
evidence of progression in severity of the histologic changes compared to the 14-week study.  
An  investigational  study  was  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  which  provided  support  that  the 
hippocampal  vacuoles  contain  nusinersen  and  do  not  represent  an  adverse  histopathological  finding. 
Indeed, the observation of vacuoles is linked to the method of tissue preservation in the presence of 
drug,  thereby  allowing  these  to  be  called  fixation-induced  vacuoles.  Vacuolation  in  the  inferior 
hippocampus  was  absent  in  tissues  immersion-fixed  in  Carnoy’s  or  perfusion-fixed  with  Karnovsky’s 
fixative.  
Results  of  the  two  developmental  and  reproductive  toxicity  studies  were  negative  for  drug-  related 
effects on fertility and embryo-fetal development. Biodistribution results indicated that nusinersen did 
not cross the placenta and, therefore, maternal exposure does not lead to any toxicologically relevant 
exposure in the developing fetus.  
Nusinersen  was  non-genotoxic  when  tested  in  the  bacterial  reverse  mutagenesis  assay,  in  vitro 
chromosomal  aberration  assay  in  CHO  cells  and  the  in  vivo  mouse  micronucleus  assay.  Therefore, 
nusinersen was interpreted to be neither mutagenic nor clastogenic.  
Carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with  nusinersen.  Nusinersen  is  not  genotoxic  and 
does  not  have  a  direct  mechanism  for  tumor  induction.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the 
pharmacological  action  of nusinersen,  i.e.,  restoration  of  full-length  SMN  protein  via  the  SMN2  gene, 
poses  a  carcinogenic  risk  for  SMA  patients.  Based  on  a  weight-  of-evidence  assessment,  nusinersen 
does not pose a meaningful carcinogenic risk for patients.  
The  safety  margin  for  comparing  monkey  toxicology  results  to  the  dose  administered  to  patients  is 
based  on  the  cumulative  dose  administered  in  a  set  period.  The  cumulative  doses  in  the  53-week 
study  were  3.9,  13  and  52  mg  (Table  20).  The  cumulative  doses  in  the  monkey  studies  were 
converted  to  human  equivalent  doses  (HED)  based  on  the  nominal  volume  difference  in  CSF 
(approximately 10-fold between monkeys and patients > 2 years old).

Table  2  Safety  Margin  Calculations  for  First  Year  and  Chronic  (Maintenance) 
Dosing 
The calculated safety margin for IT doses in monkeys to IT doses in humans is based on the different 
CSF  volumes  in  the  two  species  (approximately  10-fold  greater  absolute  CSF  volume  in  humans  2 
years or older).  
SMA patients will receive four loading doses in the first year of treatment to reach CNS steady- state 
tissue  concentrations  as  rapidly  as  possible,  followed  by  maintenance  dosing  every  4  months.  This 
cumulative dose of 72 mg during the first year of treatment results in a safety margin of 7.2-fold (520 
mg/72  mg).  Thereafter,  the  safety  margin  during  maintenance  dosing  will  be  14.4-fold  (520  mg/36 
mg).  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for  Human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  was  performed.  A  PEC  surface  water  (1.87X10-6  µg/L) 
based on  a  DOSEAI  of  12  mg/inhabitant/day  and  a fraction  market penetration  of  3.12X10-7  (based 
on SMA prevalence of 0.0019%), resulted very low and did not trigger the action limit calculation. An 
evaluation of PBT properties is required if the log Kow is greater than 4.5, and a study supporting the 
partition coefficient data was in the process of being finalised during the assessment. The preliminary 
data indicated that the experimental log Dow determined to be less than 4.5. 
Because of the above considerations, Spinraza is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
nusinersen  is  a  2´-O-(2  methoxyethyl)  antisense  oligonucleotide  (ASO)  for  the  treatment  of  spinal 
muscular  atrophy  (SMA).  Nusinersen  is  intended  to  be  chronically  administered  for  the  treatment  of 
patients  with  SMA  via  the  intrathecal  (IT)  route.  As  humans  are  the  only  species  known  to  have  the 
SMN2  gene  and  it  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of  nusinersen  in  a  pharmacologically 
responsive  species.  The  nonclinical  program  for  nusinersen  consisted  studies  to  evaluate  the 
pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  tissue  distribution,  and  nonclinical  toxicology  safety  (off 
target)  of  nusinersen.  The  activity  of  nusinersen  was  investigated  in  patient  fibroblasts  and  in 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 29/117 
  
  
 
 
 
transgenic mouse models of SMA models in which the human SMN2 gene is integrated into the mouse 
genome.  
Pharmacology  studies  evaluated  the  ability  of  nusinersen  in  promoting  increased  amounts  of  full-
length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene  using in vitro and in vivo studies.  In some of these studies 
(Study  396443-NP04  and  Study  396443-NP05)  it  is  unclear  as  to  what  doses  and  which  tests  were 
carried  out  at  which  dose  within  these  studies.  The  applicant  is  asked  for  clarification.  In  safety 
pharmacology  studies  male  albino  rats  were  given  continuous  IT  Infusions  of  0,  0.02,  0.06  and  0.2 
mg/day.  There  were  no  effects  on  pulmonary  function  (respiratory  rate,  tidal  volume,  and  minute 
volume),  blood  pressure  (systolic,  diastolic,  and  mean  arterial)  and  heart  rate.  Safety  pharmacology 
parameters  were  also  evaluated  in  single  (1,  3,  and  7  mg)  and  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  in 
juvenile  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Transient  deficits  in  lower  spinal  reflexes  were  seen  at  ≥ 3  mg  in  the 
53  week  study,  which  affected  lower  spinal  reflexes  (patellar,  grip,  and  anal).  The  most  significant 
findings were observed after the first IT dose (Day 1) and consisted of reduced or missing reflexes in 
4  of  7  females  and  1  of  7  male  animals  in  the  4  mg  dose  group.  In  general,  these  changes  were 
reversible  within  48  hours  following  dosing.  There  were  no  test  article  related  effects  on 
neurobehavioral  or  learning  parameters.  Details  of  the  deficit  in  lower  spinal  reflexes  are  included  in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. These findings could have been procedure related. This could be monitored 
in a long term registry study.  
While intact nusinersen was the most abundant ASO detected in monkey tissues, it is noted that the 
drug-related  17-mer  oligonucleotide  (N-1  from  the  3´end)  was  detected  in  a  relative  abundance  of 
more  than  15%.  The  pharmacological  effects  of  this  metabolite,  including  its  putative  antagonist 
effects  against  nusinersen,  where  asked  to  be  further  clarified.  The  applicant  explained  that 
nusinersen  is  metabolized  slowly,  and  predominantly  via  exonuclease  hydrolysis  (3'  and  5' 
exonucleases).  The 17-mer (n-1 from 3' end) is expected to have the same physical properties as the 
parent ASO.  Since it has the identical base sequence with one base removed from the 3' end, the 17-
mer metabolite would bind to the same pre-mRNA sequence but with a slightly lower binding affinity 
(measured  by  Tm).    According  to  the  applicant,  the  17-mer  metabolite  is  not  expected  to  interfere 
with  the  pharmacological  activity  of  nusinersen,  which  is  binding  to  a  specific  site  in  pre-mRNA  and 
promoting  inclusion  of  exon7  in  SMN2  mRNA.  Nevertheless,  the  applicant  did  not  evaluate  the 
pharmacological effects of this metabolite, including its putative antagonist effects against nusinersen, 
but  a  15-mer  ASO  version  of  nusinersen  was  tested  in  vitro  and  in  the  transgenic  mouse  model, 
showing similar or slightly less activity. These results suggest that the 17-mer metabolite, if present in 
the  active  compartment  of  the  cell,  would  retain  pharmacologic  activity  and  potency  similar  to  (or 
slightly  less)  than  the  parent  ASO.  The  percentage  of  the  17-mer  metabolite  is  not  expected  to 
increase  over  time.  It is  agreed  that  no  dose-adjustment  is  recommended, given that pharmacologic 
activity and potency (ug/g basis) of the 17-mer metabolite is expected to be only slightly less than the 
parent ASO. 
Both the parent ASO and the 17-mer metabolite are uniformly modified polymers with 2'-MOE at each 
residue.  This modification prevents the parent and the 17-mer from forming duplexes which would be 
degraded by RNase H.  Thus, there is no potential for the 17-mer metabolite to promote degradation 
of other mRNA sequences from non-target genes. 
nusinersen non-clinical pharmacokinetics were assessed following single IT lumbar bolus injections (1 
to 7 mg) in adult monkeys and following multiple IT lumbar bolus injections for 4, 14 or 53 weeks in 
juvenile monkeys.  The dosing regimen used during the first 4 weeks of the 14-week study was once 
weekly  administration  for  all  dose  groups  and  was  intended  to  provide  a  loading  period.  Following  a 
single  nusinersen  IT  dose  at  1,  3  and  7  mg  in  adult  monkeys,  both  CSF  and  plasma  concentrations 
exhibited  multiphasic  disposition,  with  a  rapid  distribution  phase  followed  by  slower  and  prolonged 
elimination  (post-distribution)  phase(s).  Mean  nusinersen  CSF  concentrations  measured  7  days  after 
dosing were dose-dependent and typically increased during periods of weekly or bi-weekly dosing as

would  be  expected  with  multiple  dosing  in  both  the  14-week  and  53-week  studies  and  is  consistent 
with  the observed  CNS  tissue  accumulation  and  long-term elimination  half-life.  The  16-mer  (N-2,  3’-
Deletion)  oligonucleotide  can  be  regarded  as  a  human  specific  metabolite,  based  on  the  levels 
detected in human urine (7.89% ± 12.25%) when compared to maximum levels observed in monkey 
lumbar spinal column (2.96% ± 0.32%).   
The  single-dose  toxicity/PK  study  and  core  repeat-dose  (14-weeks  and  53-weeks)  studies  were 
conducted  in  a  single  species,  cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  the  non-human  primate  studies  transient 
deficits in lower spinal cord reflexes were noted. In the 14 week study these effects were seen at 3 mg 
and  4mg  in the  53  week study.  In  the  14  week  study,  these  effects  consisted  of  negative  responses 
for cutaneous (left and right sides), sensory foot (left and right), and/or tail reflexes.  There were no 
effects  on  cerebral  reflexes,  general  sensory  or  motor  function  parameters  during  the  study,  at  any 
dose  (0.3,  1  or  3  mg).  In  the  53  week  study  lower  spinal  reflexes  affected  patellar,  grip,  and  anal 
were  seen  at  4  mg.  The  most  significant  findings  were  observed  after  the  first  IT  dose  (Day  1)  and 
consisted of reduced or missing reflexes in 4 of 7 females and 1 of 7 male animals in the 4 mg dose 
group.  In  general,  these  changes  were  reversible  within  48  hours  following  dosing.  Details  of  the 
deficit in lower spinal reflexes are included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. These finding could have been 
procedure related . This could be monitored in a long term registry study. 
In  the  14-week  monkey  toxicity  study,  1/7  animals  at  3  mg  had  a  necrotic  neuron  in  the 
hippocampus.  Another  animal  at  this  dose  had  some  necrotic  glial  cells,  which  were  also  seen  in  1 
recovery  animal  at  this  dose.  In  the  53-week  study,  some  necrotic  cells  and  cellular  debris  were 
observed in the hippocampus in 1 male at 1 mg and 3/7 males at 4mg. Rare necrotic cells were also 
noted (in the hippocampus) in one recovery male at 4.0 mg. The Applicant goes onto say that based 
on  a  5-point  microscopic  severity  grading  scale,  the  hippocampal  vacuolation  findings  from  both 
studies were mainly slight (Grade 1) and minimal (Grade 2) with one mild (Grade 3). In the opinion of 
the  study  pathologist,  the  histologic  findings  in  the  hippocampus  were  unlikely  to  cause  any  clinical 
signs  or  influence  animal  ability  to  function.  This  interpretation,  based  on  the  microscopic  severity, 
was supported by the lack of effects on neurobehavioral assessments in these animals. As a result 4 
mg was considered the NOAEL in the 53 week study and 1 mg in the 14 week study.  
It is accepted that the 14-week and 53-week toxicology studies were conducted in juvenile monkeys 
to  support  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  and  were  appropriately  conducted  in  this  respect.  The 
Applicant  sates  that  the  highest  dose  of  3  mg/dose  was  administered  IT  every  week  for  15 
consecutive weeks (total dose of 45 mg, which is equivalent to a human dose of 450 mg in 14 weeks, 
based on the 10-fold difference in CSF volume between monkeys and humans). In the 53-week study, 
animals  received  5  weekly  IT  doses,  followed  by  maintenance  dosing  every  6  weeks.  The 
loading/maintenance dosing regimen in the 53-week study is more frequent than the proposed clinical 
treatment, which envisions 6 loading doses in the first year followed by 3 maintenance doses per year, 
thereafter. Animals at 4 mg/dose were given 52 mg in one year, which is equivalent to a human dose 
of 520 mg in one year.  
In both toxicology studies, observed microscopic changes (either a necrotic neuron, necrotic glial cells, 
or  cellular  debris)  were  limited  to  the  inferior  hippocampal  region of  the  brain  in  animals  exposed  to 
the highest dose (3 or 4 mg per dose). The histological findings in the hippocampus were associated 
with  hippocampal  ASO  concentrations  of  149  and  88.9  μg/g  in  the  14-week  and  53-week  studies, 
respectively.  
The Applicant argued that these histological changes were not associated with any functional or clinical 
consequence  in  either  of  the  toxicology  studies  and  there  was  no  progression.  However  the  lack  of 
functional or clinical consequence in relation to microscopic findings such as these, is not a sufficiently

robust end-point on which this safety assessment can be based, and as the Applicant has stated, the 
long-term  consequences  of  the  persistence  of  ISIS396443  in  neurons  in  the  brain  is  not  known. 
However  reassurance  is  gained  from the  fact that  the  ASO  tissue  concentrations  in  the  hippocampus 
achieved  at  the  highest  doses  in  monkeys  (3  or  4  mg/dose)  were  above  the  target  concentrations 
needed to produce a pharmacological effect in spinal motor neurons from animal models (between 2 
and  10  μg/g)  and  the  proposed  dose  in  human,  12  mg/dose,  is  intended  to  achieve  the 
pharmacologically  active  tissue  concentration 
in  spinal  motor  neurons,  while  hippocampal 
concentrations remain well below the hippocampal concentrations measured in the toxicology studies 
at  the  highest  doses  and  the  proposed  dose  to  patients  with  SMA,  12  mg/dose,  would  result  in  a 
yearly dose (36 mg/year), which is below the human equivalent dose administered to monkeys in the 
high dose group (4 mg) from the 53-week study (520 mg/year, human equivalent).  
Regarding  the  potential  cellular  activation  and  cytokine  production  due  to  pro-inflammatory  effects 
evidence was provided that there was no indication of cellular activation and cytokine production due 
to pro-inflammatory effects in the animal studies and none in the clinical setting. 
Long term data are not available. Patients will be followed up long term via the planned and ongoing 
studies outlined in the risk management plan, in Part III and IV of the document.  
In a single combined fertility and early development study conducted in CD-1 mice (SC 3, 10, and 25 
mg/kg),  no  significant  changes  to  morphology,  motility  or  concentration  of  sperm  was  noted.  In 
female  mice  there  were  no  significant  effects  noted  on  fertility,  oestrous  cycling,  fetal  weight,  fetal 
death and there evidence of treatment-related malformations. The fertility sub-heading in Section 4.6 
of the proposed SmPC was revised to reflect the lack of knowledge on the human effects.   
Two studies embryo-fœtal development were conducted in New Zealand White rabbits. There were no 
findings  to  suggest  treatment-related  effects  on  embryo-fetal  development  following  treatment  with 
nusinersen  at  any  dose  (0,  6,  12.6  or  25  mg/kg  (0,  21,  44.1,  and  87.5  mg/kg/week)  on  Gestation 
Days (GD) 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18). The proposed wording of the pregnancy part of section 4.6 in 
the SmPC is adequate.  
The pre- and post natal development study has been completed in female pregnant CD-1 mice treated 
subcutaneously  with  nusinersen  at  doses  of  1.4,  5.8,  and  17.2  mg/kg  (5,  20  and  60  mg/kg/week) 
over gestation day 6 through to day 20 of lactation.  Reduction in kidney/liver/spleen absolute weights 
was observed in the high dose group (17.2 mg/kg), and increased kidney weight was observed in the 
mid-dose level (5.8 mg/kg).  Changes in organ weights are thought to be attributed to treatment with 
oligonucleotides  and  due  to  dose  accumulation.    Similar  findings  were  observed  in  other 
developmental studies in mice and rabbits however these changes are unlikely to affect development 
or growth to the F1 generation offspring.  There was no evidence of adverse effects to pups in terms 
of mortality, sexual maturation, motor activity, learning or ability to mate/reproduce.  The NOAEL for 
maternal toxicity and development is 17.2 mg/kg (60 mg/kg/week).  
In  the  study,  concentrations  of  nusinersen  in  breast  milk  from  lactating  pregnant  females  were 
measured.  These levels increased in a dose-dependent manner and ranged from 0.00847 to 0.0552 
μg/mL.  These levels were very low compared to that detected in liver samples and had no significant 
effect on pup development.  
The applicant did not propose changes to the warnings in section 4.6 of the SmPC/PL because of this 
study, and this was agreed.  Wording of all sections of 4.6 have been updated to bring into line with 
the  Guideline  on  Risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  on  human  reproduction.    It  is  unknown  if 
nusinersen/metabolites  are  excreted  in  breast  milk  and  the  limited  evidence  in  nursed  mice  suggest 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 32/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no  effect  on  development.    Use  of  nusinersen  during  breastfeeding  may  be  appropriately  covered  in 
the warnings in section 4.6. 
Conventional  studies  of  genotoxicity  (Ames  test  in  Salmonella  typhimurium  and  Escherichia  coli 
reverse mutation assay, In Vitro Chromosomal Aberration Assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
and  a  bone  marrow  micronucleus  assay  following  SC  administration  to  CD-1  mice  revealed  no 
genotoxic potential of nusinersen. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with nusinersen. The carcinogenic risk of nusinersen 
for patients was evaluated using a weight-of-evidence approach, which considered key principles for 
carcinogenicity assessment. Humans already make full-length SMN protein from the SMN1 gene and 
make varying percentages of full-length protein from the SMN2 gene. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No further concerns require clarification from a non-clinical point of view. For this reason, from a non-
clinical  point  of  view,  no  further  issues  preclude  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  for 
nurinersen.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The nusinersen clinical development program was designed to evaluate nusinersen across a range of 
SMA phenotypes to address the unmet medical need in a general population of patients with SMA. The 
studies  conducted  to  date  include  3  completed  and  7  ongoing  clinical  studies:  2  studies  in 
symptomatic infantile-onset SMA, 5 studies in symptomatic later-onset (Type II and Type III) SMA, 1 
study  in  patients  with  genetically  diagnosed,  presymptomatic  SMA,  and  2  studies  in  patients  with 
symptomatic  infantile-  and  later-onset  SMA  (Figure  3).  Unless  stated  otherwise,  multiple  doses  of 
nusinersen were studied.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The key findings for nusinersen pharmacokinetics and drug interaction potential were evaluated based 
on data from in vitro studies using human biomaterials and data from clinical studies. 
Ten studies comprise the nusinersen clinical program. To date, 3 studies have been completed and 7 
studies are ongoing. For this application, the PK and clinical pharmacological properties of nusinersen 
have  been  characterized  using  data  from  the  3  completed  studies  in  later-onset  5q  spinal  muscular 
atrophy,  as  well  as  data  from  4  of  the  7  ongoing  studies:  1  in  later-onset  SMA,  2  in  infantile-onset 
SMA and 1 in infants genetically diagnosed with SMA but presymptomatic at study start. The PK data 
from the remaining 3 ongoing studies were not available for evaluation since those studies were still 
ongoing and/or blinded.  
Over the course of the development program, nusinersen treatment was initially evaluated in studies 
of  subjects  with  later-onset  SMA  and  subsequently  in  studies  of  infants  diagnosed  with  SMA.  The 
population  of  subjects  with  later-onset  SMA  includes  subjects  ≥ 2  years  old  at  screening  and  the 
population  of  infants  diagnosed  with  SMA  includes  subjects  with  infantile-onset  SMA  (subjects  ≤ 7 
months  of  age  at  screening)  and  infants  with  genetically  diagnosed  and  presymptomatic  SMA 
(subjects ≤ 6 weeks of age at the time of first dose). 
Nusinersen  was  evaluated  in  vitro  for  binding  to  proteins  in  human  CSF  and  plasma,  inhibition  or 
substrate  activity  of  human  BCRP,  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp),  OAT1,  OAT3,  OCT1,  OCT2,  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3,  and  BSEP  mediated  transport,  and  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  induction  or  inhibition.  An 
ultrafiltration  method  was  used  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  protein  binding  of  nusinersen  in  whole 
plasma  and  CSF  in  vitro,  where  the  concentrations  in  plasma,  CSF  and  ultrafiltrate  were  determined 
using  a  nuclease-dependent  hybridization  ELISA  detection  method.  Transporter  interactions  were 
evaluated  with  nine  major  transporters,  and  transporter  activity  was  assessed  by  radiometric 
detection  of  movement  of  radiolabeled  substrate  across  a  polarized  cell  monolayer  or  membrane 
vesicles  expressing  the  transporter.  CYP450  interactions  were  evaluated  with  seven  major  enzymes, 
and enzyme activity was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of 
hepatocyte  culture  medium  (for  enzyme  activity  in  the  presence  of  substrate)  and  by  reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of RNA isolated from the cells (for gene expression)

The  in  vivo  PK  of  nusinersen  have  been  characterized  in  4  open-label  studies  in  subjects  with  later-
onset  SMA;  these  include  the  completed  Studies  CS1,  CS2,  and  CS10  and  ongoing  Study  CS12. 
Subjects who completed treatment in CS1 were permitted to enrol in CS2 or CS10 and subsequently 
into CS12. The cut-off date for the CS12 PK data that are included in this summary is 07 April 2016. 
The PK of nusinersen in infants with SMA  have been evaluated using data from 2 studies in subjects 
with  infantile-onset  SMA,  studies  CS3A  and  CS3B  and  1  study  in  genetically  diagnosed  and 
presymptomatic infants with SMA, study SM201. All of these infantile-onset SMA studies are ongoing. 
Data cut-off dates for the PK data are 26 January 2016, 15 June 2016, and 08 June 2016 for Studies 
CS3A, CS3B, and SM201, respectively. 
In  addition  to  PK  analyses  for  individual  studies,  PK  data  from  Studies  CS1,  CS2,  CS10,  CS3A  and 
CS12 were pooled and analyzed using a population PK approach.  
PK  data  from  the  remaining  3  ongoing  studies  comprising  the  clinical  program  (Studies  CS4,  Study 
SM202 and CS11) are not yet available for inclusion. 
Nusinersen was administered via an intrathecal (IT) injection in all studies. A single dose of drug was 
administered  in  Study  CS1.  In  Study  CS10,  a  single  additional  dose  of  nusinersen  was  administered 
after  the  initial  dose  on  Study  CS1.  Studies  CS2,  CS12,  CS3A,  CS3B  and  SM201  are  multiple-dose 
studies. 
Two formulations of nusinersen have been used in the clinical development program. For Studies CS1, 
CS2,  CS10,  for  Study  CS12  prior  to  17  February  2016  or  22  February  2016  depending  upon  the 
clinical  site,  and  for  Study  CS3A  prior  to  15  December  2015,  nusinersen  was  supplied  in  a  2-vial 
configuration, with a vial of a concentrated aqueous solution of nusinersen at a dosage strength of 20 
mg/mL (2.5 mL per vial) and a vial of diluent. The drug in the concentrated solution was diluted at the 
clinical  site  to  the  required  concentration  for  injection  (range:  0.2  to  2.4  mg/mL),  with  the  diluent 
composition  designed  so  that  the  final  solution  approximated  the  salt  concentrations  in  naturally-
occurring  human  CSF.  For  Study  CS12  beginning  17  February  2016,  for  Study  CS3A  beginning  15 
December 2015, and for Studies CS3B and SM201, nusinersen was supplied in a ready-to-use, single-
vial formulation at a dosage strength of 2.4 mg/mL (5.0 mL per vial). This formulation was supplied at 
the  appropriate  drug  concentration  for  injection,  with  the  drug  dissolved  in  an  aqueous  solution 
approximating  the  salt  concentrations  in  naturally  occurring  human  CSF.  The  administered  drug 
product is identical for both formulations; the 2 configurations differ only in primary packaging and the 
requirement for dilution. Nusinersen was administered at doses ranging from 1 mg to 12 mg as an IT 
bolus  injection  by  lumbar  puncture.  For  subjects  over  24  months  (2  years)  of  age  at  the  time  of 
dosing, the injection volume was fixed at 5.0 mL (12-mg). For subjects 24 months of age or younger 
at  the  time  of  dosing,  the  injection  volume  was  adjusted  according  to  subject  age  based  on  relative 
CSF volume. 
Nusinersen  concentrations  in  human  CSF  and  plasma  were  measured  by  a  validated  hybridization 
enzyme  linked  immunosorbent  assay  method  for  Study  CS1  and  by  a  validated  hybridization 
electrochemiluminescence assay method for the other 6 studies.  
Noncompartmental methods were used to calculate PK parameters from the single- and multipledose 
clinical  studies  when  feasible.  The  PK  data  from  Studies  CS1,  CS2,  CS10,  CS3A  and  CS12  were 
combined and analyzed using a population PK approach.

Absorption  
IT injection of nusinersen into the CSF allows the drug to be administered in close proximity to the site 
of action within the CNS.  
Following  IT  administration,  nusinersen  is  rapidly  transferred  from  CSF  into  the  systemic  circulation, 
with  a  median  time  to  maximum  concentration  (Tmax)  of  1.7  to  6.0  hours  in  plasma  in  both  later-
onset subjects and infants diagnosed with SMA. 
Distribution 
IT-administered  nusinersen  appears  to  be  widely  distributed  into  CNS  tissues  (including  the  target 
spinal cord tissues), and is cleared through transfer into the systemic circulation.  
Nusinersen  trough  concentrations  in  plasma  were  relatively  low  compared  to  those  in  CSF.  After 
reaching  the  peak  level,  plasma  concentrations  of  nusinersen  declined  rapidly  followed  by  a  much 
slower decline, indicating a biphasic disposition in plasma. The rapid decline in plasma concentrations 
is likely due to extensive distribution to systemic tissues.   
Elimination 
The metabolites of nusinersen observed in CSF, plasma, and  urine samples from subjects with later-
onset  SMA  following  multiple  IT  administrations  suggest  that  nusinersen  is  metabolized  slowly  by 
exonuclease (3’- and 5’)-mediated hydrolysis, which is not dependent on the liver. 
Less than 0.5% of the administered dose was excreted into urine in the first 24 hours in subjects with 
later-onset  SMA.  While  urine  was  only  collected  for  a  small  fraction  (<2%)  of  the  half-life  of 
nusinersen,  the  primary  route  of  elimination  is  likely  by  urinary  excretion  for  nusinersen  and  its 
metabolites. 
In subjects with later-onset SMA, the terminal elimination half-life in CSF is approximately 135 to 177 
days  supporting  infrequent  (e.g.,  4  to  6  months)  maintenance  dosing.  Due  to  the  lack  of  data 
available from post dose samples, the half-life could not be calculated in infants diagnosed with SMA. 
However,  the  population  PK  estimates  for  median  terminal  half-life  was163  days  for  the  overall 
population  and  ranged  from160  to  163  days  for  the  later-onset  subjects  and  159  to  172  days  for 
infantile-onset subjects, all within the range of the observed values. 
The terminal elimination half-life in plasma was estimated to be 63 to 87 days in subjects with later-
onset SMA and could not be calculated in infants due to the limited sample collection postdose. Based 
on  peak  (Cmax)  or  total  exposure  (AUC0-4hr,  AUC0-6hr,  and  AUC0-20hr),  no  accumulation  of 
nusinersen was evident in plasma after multiple doses. Comparison of plasma PK in different days of 
administration  was  performed  in  study  CS2  (Day  1  vs  Day  85)  showing  similar  behaviour  and 
negligible accumulation.

EMA/289068/2017

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Overall, after accounting for differences in body weight, the PK characteristics of nusinersen in the CSF 
and plasma were similar across studies and appear to be similar in subjects with later-onset SMA and 
infants diagnosed with SMA (i.e., infantile-onset SMA and presymptomatic SMA infants).  
CSF  drug  concentrations  appeared  to  increase  proportionally  from  1  mg  to  12  mg  in  subjects  with 
later-onset  SMA  (subjects  2  years  of  age  or  older  at  screening)  and  dose  proportionally  over  doses 
from  6  mg  to  12  mg  in  infants  diagnosed  with  SMA  (subjects  7  months  or  younger  at  screening). 
nusinersen trough  concentrations in  the  CSF  accumulated  approximately  1.4 to  3.0-fold  and  reached 
steady  state  after  multiple  12  mg  loading  and  maintenance  doses  at  around  22.5  months  in  both 
later-onset  subjects  and  infants  diagnosed  with  SMA.  No  further  accumulation  in  CSF  or  CNS  tissue 
concentrations would be expected with additional doses after steady state. 
There  was  an  approximately  dose  proportional  increase  in  maximum  concentration  (Cmax)  and  area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values in plasma over the evaluated dose range. Cmax and 
AUC were greater in infants diagnosed with SMA than in subjects with later-onset SMA given the same 
dose, consistent with their lower body weight. 
Special populations 
Covariates that may influence the disposition of nusinersen were initially explored in Study CS1, and 
further  evaluated  by  a  population  PK  analysis  using  data  from  Studies  CS1,  CS2,  CS10,  CS12,  and 
CS3A.  The  major  conclusions  were  that  the  central  volume  in  the  CSF  and  in  plasma  and  the  CL  in 
plasma are related to increasing body weight of an infant or child as they grow during a clinical study. 
CL  in  CSF  is  not  related  to  body  weight.  Gender  is  unlikely  to  affect  the  PK  of  nusinersen.  Race  is 
unlikely to affect the PK of nusinersen noting that the majority of subjects identified as Caucasian. 
Considering  the  PK  of  nusinersen  and  the  2-O-(2-methoxyethyl  (2ʹ-MOE)  antisense  oligonucleotide 
(ASO)  class,  the  natural  history  of  the  target  population,  the  fact  that  nusinersen  is  metabolized  by 
exonuclease-mediated  hydrolysis  (which  is  not  dependent  on  hepatic  function),  maturation  of  renal 
function in infants (where renal function is approximately 50% of adults and increases to adult levels 
by  1  year  of  age),  hepatic  and  renal  effects  are  not  anticipated.  Renal  or  hepatic  impairment 
conditions  are  not  commonly  seen  in  patients  with  SMA,  making  the  pool  of  potential  subjects  very 
small, therefore studies in these populations were not performed. In addition, within the limited range 
of  the  hepatic  and  renal  chemistry  markers  evaluated  in  clinical  studies,  the  markers  did  not 
contribute to intersubject variability in PK among the subjects studied in the Population PK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential for drug interactions with nusinersen is low. The metabolites of nusinersen observed in 
CSF,  plasma,  and  urine  samples  from  subjects  with  later-onset  SMA  following  multiple  IT 
administrations  suggest  that  nusinersen  is  metabolized  slowly  by  exonuclease  (3’-  and  5’)-mediated 
hydrolysis. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 40/117 
  
  
 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP450-mediated oxidative 
metabolism  and  therefore  should  not interfere  with other  drugs  for these  metabolic  pathways.  Given 
that  drug-drug  interactions  are  not  expected  for  nusinersen,  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies 
were not conducted and an analysis of extrinsic factors such as the effect of other drugs on nusinersen 
was not performed. 
Nusinersen is not a substrate or inhibitor of human BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, or BSEP transporters, although these transports were evaluated at very high concentrations 
due  to  analytical  limitations.  Therefore,  the  likelihood  of  drug-drug  interactions  due  to  competition 
with or inhibition of these transporters is very low. 
Nusinersen is highly bound to human plasma proteins (> 94% bound) at clinically relevant or higher 
plasma  concentrations  (100  ng/mL  and  5  μg/mL),  which  limits  glomerular  filtration  (reducing  renal 
clearance  of  the  drug)  and  therefore  facilitates  distribution  to  systemic  tissues.  However,  protein 
binding  in  plasma  for  this  class  of  ASOs  is  relatively  weak  and  the  binding  sites  for  these  types  of 
hydrophilic drugs differ from the binding sites of low molecular weight hydrophobic drugs. Therefore, 
the likelihood of drug-drug interactions due to competition with plasma protein binding is very low. In 
addition, nusinersen binding to human CSF proteins seems to be low (< 25%). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Antisense  oligonucleotides  are  synthetic  nucleic  acid  analogues  that  bind  to  a  target  RNA  through 
Watson-Crick base pairing and interfere with RNA-splicing. The antisense oligonucleotide needs to be 
(about) 20- to 25-bases long to ensure that it binds to a specific, known site on the target mRNA. 
Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by homozygous deletion of the gene for 'survival of motor neuron 
1'  (SMN1).  Humans  carry  a  near  identical  gene  called  'survival  of  motor  neuron  2'  (SMN2)  which 
differs  from  the  SMN1  gene  by  11  nucleotides.  One  of  the  nucleotide  changes  occurs  in  an  exon 
splicing  enhancer  region  of  exon  7  of  SMN2  leading  to  loss  of  exon  7.  About  90%  of  the  mature 
transcripts  of  SMN2  are  missing  exon  7  and  are  translated  into  a  truncated  protein  that  is  rapidly 
degraded. 
Nusinersen targets an intronic region of the SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) normally occupied by 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1/A2 proteins [Hua 2008; Rigo 2012]. nusinersen 
displaces  these  proteins,  thereby  promoting  inclusion  of  exon  7  into  the  SMN2  mRNA,  resulting  in 
higher  levels  of  full-length  transcripts.  This  in  turn  results  in  the  increased  production  of  full-length, 
functional SMN protein. 
No  available  PD  biomarker  currently  exists  for  nusinersen.  CSF  SMN  protein  levels  were  explored  in 
several clinical studies but no clear relationships were identified with nusinersen. Because nusinersen 
is  administered  intrathecally  and  levels  achieved  peripherally  are  not  thought  to  be  therapeutic, 
peripheral SMN protein levels were not explored. Several reasons may explain why no association has 
been identified between CSF SMN protein levels and nusinersen including that the role of SMN protein 
in  the  CSF  is  not  currently  known;  there  are  differences  in  CSF  SMN  protein  levels  between  healthy 
CHMP Assessment report

controls and SMA patients; and the optimal time to measure the effect of nusinersen on SMN protein 
in the CSF is not known. 
PD characteristics of nusinersen were determined from studies of available autopsy samples collected 
from  infants  with  SMA.  Autopsy  samples  from  3  infants  with  infantile-onset  SMA  treated  with 
nusinersen  in  Study  CS3A  had  higher  levels  of  full-length  SMN2  mRNA  in  the  thoracic  spinal  cord 
compared  to  infants  with  SMA  who  did  not  receive  nusinersen.  Full  length  SMN2  mRNA  and  SMN 
protein were also identified in other regions of the spinal cord and CNS. 
The current product binds to the SMN2 transcript before the splicing machinery recognizes exon 7 in 
order to modulate mRNA processing and so increase the inclusion of exon 7 resulting in the production 
of a full-length product to take the place and function of the missing SMN1 product. In addition, the 
product  was  modified  by  2′-O-methoxyethyl  additions  to  prevent  the  actions  of  RNase  H  or  RNA 
interference mechanisms in the pharmacology studies. 
Nusinersen was identified after screening over 500 potential candidates by in vitro assays of activity. 
The  preferred  site  to  promote  exon  7  inclusion  was  found  to  be  (about)  10  nucleotides  downstream 
from  the  intron  /  exon  junction,  also  referred  to  as  the  intron  splicing  silencer  N1  (ISS-N1).  In  the 
absence of treatment, approximately 30% of the SMN2 transcripts in patient fibroblasts cells are full 
length, i.e. contain exon 7. 
The  proposed  mechanism  of  action  was  considered  plausible  based  on  the  data  available  from 
published literature. 
Primary  pharmacodynamics  of  the  current  product  were  studied  in  the  pre-clinical  component  of  the 
development programme.  
It is understood that human-related pre-clinical studies were conducted in fibroblasts only (because of 
the  nature  of  the  underlying  disease)  whereas  studies  of  transgenic  mice  were  more  extensive  in 
terms of tissues studied. 
Treatment of patient fibroblasts with the lead candidate nusinersen increased the amount of full length 
transcript expressed and decreased the amount of transcripts missing exon 7 (Δ7) in a concentration-
dependent  manner.  Treatment  of  patient  fibroblasts  with  nusinersen  also  increased  the  amount  of 
SMN  protein  produced  in  these  cells.  Treatment  of  SMA  fibroblasts  with  nusinersen  increased  the 
number of punctate nuclear structures containing SMN protein (‘Gems’). 
The company stated that although nusinersen likely increases SMN protein levels at the site of action 
within  the  neuron,  a  measurement  of  the  increase  in  tissue  in  subjects  is  not  feasible.  The  closest 
concentrations  that  can  be  measured  are  CSF  concentrations,  which  are  highly  variable  in  the  infant 
population  due  to  marked  changes  in  SMN  protein  in  utero  and  early  neonatal  period.  In  addition, 
since no data are available from control subjects, the actual change in SMN protein concentrations in 
CSF  could  not  be  assessed.  In  light  of  these  limitations,  no  relationship  was  observed  between  CSF 
concentrations of nusinersen and SMN protein concentrations in the CSF. 
In  vivo  pharmacology  was  carried  out  in  mouse  models.  Nusinersen  is  predicted  to  bind  uniquely  to 
the ISS-N1 sites present only in the SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNA transcripts. Furthermore, nusinersen 
is  not  homologous  to  any  other  regions  of  the  human  transcriptome  with  17  or  16  consecutive 
nucleotides matches. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 42/117 
  
  
 
Three additional potential transcripts were identified with homology to nusinersen. All are 
uncharacterised transcripts and all are Model genes, predicted by an automated pipeline without 
manual curation. Using current techniques, the company has not been able to demonstrate that 
nusinersen may have targets other than the proposed target; this is acceptable. There were not any 
other studies carried out on secondary pharmacodynamics; this was considered acceptable 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Despite the lacking information on some aspects like e.g. the mechanism of cellular uptake, it can be 
concluded that there is a good understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the product.  
Further  deliberation  may  be  provided  on  the  POPPK  model,  particularly  on  the  determination  of  the 
effect of age on PK which should include any new data, to support the proposed dose per age group.  
Additional  PKPD  analysis  for  the  older  onset  children  would  be  useful  and  both  of  these  should  be 
considered in the post-approval programme. The Applicant is required to study the effect of age on PK 
as a post-approval measure. 
The pharmacodynamics of nusinersen is considered as relatively well understood despite the fact that 
it relies heavily on data generated in animal models. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No  specific  concerns  regarding  pharmacodynamics  are  identified  as  outstanding,  but  some  issues  in 
the  pharmacokinetics  have  led  to  the  need  for  a  post-approval  measure  (PAM),  required  to  provide 
further data. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  A PopPK model update-  the updated popPK model should include a larger number of subjects 
with short- and long-term dosing with nusinersen 
• 
• 
The company should explore whether higher doses of nusinersen could show greater efficacy, 
also providing further understand the PK/PD relationship including in later-onset patients 
(related to Pop PK model update) 
Long – term PK data to be collected from the ongoing studies – SHINE (CS11), NURTURE 
(SM201) and EMBRACE (SM202).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program of nusinersen was designed to evaluate nusinersen across a range 
of SMA phenotypes to address the unmet medical need in a general population of patients with SMA. 
The  studies  conducted  to  date  include  4  completed  and  6  ongoing  clinical  studies:  2  studies  in 
symptomatic infantile-onset SMA, 5 studies in symptomatic later-onset (Type II and Type III) SMA, 1 
study  in  patients  with  genetically  diagnosed,  pre-symptomatic  SMA,  and  2  studies  in  patients  with 
symptomatic infantile- and later-onset SMA. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 43/117 
  
  
 
 
 
Studies of nusinersen categorised patients according to the presence or absence of symptoms. Among 
patients with symptoms, studies were further categorised by the age of symptom onset. 
Efficacy  results  from  studies  in  symptomatic  patients  (2  in  subjects  with  infantile-onset  and  4  in 
subjects  with  later-onset)  and  a  study  in  pre-symptomatic  patients  are  used  to  support  the  claim  of 
efficacy.  Results  from  the  ongoing  studies  in  symptomatic  patients  with  later-onset  SMA  (interim 
analysis  results  for  study  CS4)  and  progress  reports  for  the  infantile-onset  and  later-onset  SMA 
studies  (SM202  and  CS11)  were  submitted  during  the  procedure.  The  primary  data  used  by  the 
applicant at submission to support the efficacy of nusinersen in the treatment of SMA derived from a 
pre-planned interim analysis of Study CS3B. These were later supplemented by the final results of the 
same  study  and  the  submitted  data  from  the  interim  analysis  for  study  CS4,  as  well  as  all  available 
data from the rest of the ongoing studies.  
No studies were carried out to describe dependence between dose and response in terms of efficacy.  
2.5.1.  Main studies 
Pivotal study CS3B 
“A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Procedure Controlled Study to Assess the Clinical 
Efficacy and Safety of ISIS 396443 Administered Intrathecally in Patients With Infantile-Onset Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy.” 
This was a Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-procedure controlled study of 
nusinersen conducted at 31 centres worldwide.  
At the time of the submission of the marketing authorisation application, the Applicant provided only 
the interim analysis results to inform the assessment. In the course of the procedure the final results 
became available and were included in the assessment of the B/R ratio of the product.  
At the interim analysis, only the first primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of motor milestone 
responders) was tested. A data cut-off of 15 June 2016 was chosen for this interim analysis, since it 
was anticipated that by this time approximately 80 subjects would have completed the Day 183 Visit, 
which is thought to be the minimum amount of time needed to see a meaningful improvement in 
motor milestones. These predictions were based on the open-label data available from Study ISIS 
396443-CS3A. Time to death or permanent ventilation and survival rate were not evaluated in this 
interim analysis, as it was expected that too few events would have occurred at the interim. The 
interim analysis results were reviewed by an independent DSMB and a Joint Unblinded Senior 
Management Team from Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen.  
Methods 
• 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 44/117 
  
  
 
 
The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of nusinersen administered 
intrathecally to patients with infantile-onset SMA. 
Secondary Objective 
The secondary objective of the study is to examine the safety and tolerability of nusinersen 
administered intrathecally to patients with infantile-onset SMA. 
Tertiary Objective 
The tertiary objective of the study is to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma PK of 
nusinersen administered intrathecally to patients with infantile-onset SMA. 
• 
Design  
This study was conducted to test the clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of 
nusinersen administered as IT injections by lumbar puncture (LP) to subjects with infantile-onset SMA. 
As the study is ongoing, this report presents an interim analysis of the data. 
The total duration of subject participation in the study was approximately 14 months. The study 
consisted of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Post-treatment Follow-up Period. 
Although treatment occurs over a 10-month period, given the long half-life of nusinersen, subjects are 
considered exposed to nusinersen from the time the first dose was administered to the last day of 
follow-up (13 months). 
A randomised, sham-procedure controlled, double-blind study design was chosen for Study CS3B as 
the best and most reliable way to collect data to determine the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in an 
infantile-onset SMA population; this type of study design minimises bias in data collection. A sham 
procedure was chosen for the control group in order to minimise the risks to subjects randomised to 
this group. The procedure consists of a small needle puncture on the lower back, but no LP injection or 
deeper needle insertion was to occur. A 2:1 randomisation (drug to sham procedure, respectively) was 
used in order to permit more subjects access to active treatment in this life-threatening disease while 
also having enough sham participants to complete the study with adequate power in a reasonable 
period of follow-up time. 
A length of study of approximately 1 year was considered to be the maximum feasible time for 
subjects with a life-threatening disease to be without active treatment. It is also the length that would 
provide the earliest opportunity to see a clinically meaningful improvement in function and survival. 
Across published natural history studies, the median age of death ranged from 5.9 to 7.4 months in 
patients who did not receive ventilation [Cobben 2008; Farrar 2013; Gregoretti 2013].

circulation, or safety assessments 
• 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects entered the ~10-month Treatment Period for treatment with either a scaled 
equivalent 12-mg dose of nusinersen or a sham procedure control. Nusinersen was administered using 
a loading regimen (dosing on Study Days 1, 15, 29, and 64), followed by maintenance dosing once 
every 4 months (dosing on Study Days 183 and 302). Following the injection/sham procedure on 
Study Day 1, subjects remained at the study centre for at least 24 hours for safety monitoring. On all 
other treatment days, subject remained at the study centre for at least 6 hours for safety monitoring. 
The dose level and dose intervals of nusinersen for this study were selected based on nonclinical 
toxicology and PK observations from studies in monkeys using single and repeat IT dosing over a 14-
week period, consideration of the target tissue concentration anticipated for drug pharmacology, and 
safety data in the completed and ongoing clinical studies of nusinersen. 
Nusinersen 
Subjects randomised to the nusinersen treatment group received a single IT LP injection of study drug 
as a slow bolus (1 to 3 minutes) using a spinal anaesthesia needle and 5-mL syringe. The target site 
for needle insertion was the L3/L4 space, but could be 1 segment above or 1 to 2 segments below this 
level, if needed. Spinal ultrasound could be used for the LP procedure, if it was deemed necessary, but 
was not required. Prior to each injection of study drug, 4 to 5 mL of CSF was collected for PK analyses. 
The volume of injection was adjusted based on the subject’s age on the day of dosing as shown in 
Table 3 such that each subject received a 12-mg scaled equivalent dose based on CSF volume scaling. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 46/117 
  
  
 
Thus, younger subjects were given a lower dose of drug, achieved by injecting a smaller volume that 
was proportional to estimated CSF volume for age, such that dose volume was equivalent to 5 mL for 
age 2 years to adult. 
Table 3: Study CS3B nusinersen Dose Volume to be Injected 
Sham Procedure 
In general, the sham procedure consisted of a small needle prick on the lower back at the location 
where the LP injection was normally made. The needle broke the skin but no LP injection or needle 
insertion occurred. The needle prick was covered with the same bandage that was used to cover the 
LP injection normally, thus simulating the appearance of an LP injection. The study subject was kept in 
the procedure room for the same amount of time that subjects administered study drug were kept, 
thus simulating the time period of a study drug administration procedure. 
Concomitant Therapy 
Allowed Therapies 
Throughout the study, Investigators or designated licensed physicians involved in the study could 
have prescribed concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary for AEs or to provide 
adequate supportive care. 
Disallowed Therapies 
Study subjects were prohibited from receiving other experimental agents during the study. This 
included marketed agents at experimental doses that were being tested for the treatment of SMA 
(e.g., valproate, riluzole, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, hydroxyurea, and salbutamol). 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints of the study were as follows: 
• 
Proportion of motor milestone responders (Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological 
Examination [HINE]) 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 47/117 
  
  
 
 
• 
Time to death or permanent ventilation (≥16 hours ventilation/day continuously for >21 days 
in the absence of an acute reversible event OR tracheostomy). 
Motor milestones were assessed as part of the neurological examination conducted by the neurologist 
at the study centre using Section 2 of the 3-part HINE. The assessments were performed at 
Screening, Day 64 predose, Day 183 predose, Day 302 predose, and Day 394. The subject’s ventilator 
or BiPAP use (number of hours/day) was recorded daily by the caregivers using a daily ventilator use 
diary for the duration of the study. This information was obtained during study visits and weekly 
telephone contacts. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints of the study were as follows: 
• 
Proportion of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP 
INTEND) responders. 
•  Survival rate. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Percent of subjects not requiring permanent ventilation. 
Proportion of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responders. 
Time to death or permanent ventilation in the subgroups of subjects below the study median 
disease duration. 
Time to death or permanent ventilation in the subgroups of subjects above the study median 
disease duration. 
The CHOP INTEND is a validated 16-item, 64-point motor assessment designed specifically to evaluate 
the motor skills of infants with symptomatic SMA and to accommodate their fragile nature and 
observed tolerance to item administration [Glanzman 2010]. The test was designed by an expert 
panel that was guided in item selection by the statistical characteristics of each item as well as by 
clinical judgment concerning the item’s ability to quantify motor behaviour in Type I SMA. The test 
captures neck, trunk, proximal, and distal limb strength in 14 elicited and 2 observational items and 
has been established as a safe, reliable, and clinically meaningful measure of motor function in infants 
with SMA. 
Evaluations using the CHOP INTEND motor function scale were performed by physical therapists at the 
study centres. These evaluations were scheduled at Screening (2 assessments, baseline assessment), 
Day 64 predose, Day 183 predose, Day 302 predose, and Day 394. 
CMAP measurements of ulnar nerve function in the abductor digiti minimus muscle and peroneal nerve 
function in the anterior tibialis muscle were performed or supervised by a clinical electromyographer 
at the study centre. Measurements were made at Screening (baseline assessment), Day 64 predose, 
Day 183 predose, Day 302 predose, and Day 394. 
CMAP is an electrophysiological technique that can be used to determine the approximate number of 
motor neurons in a muscle or group of muscles. CMAP is a well validated method for tracking disease 
progression in neuromuscular disorders such as SMA [Lewelt 2010; Swoboda 2005] and amyotrophic 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 48/117 
  
  
 
 
lateral sclerosis [Shefner 2011] and has been proposed as a potential biomarker of a therapeutic 
effect in SMA. 
Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints 
The tertiary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
•  Change from baseline in growth parameters (weight for age/length, chest circumference, head 
to chest circumference ratio, and arm circumference). 
•  Number of serious respiratory events. 
•  Number of hours of ventilation support. 
•  Number and length of hospitalisations. 
Growth parameters were assessed by trained site staff at the study centers. The assessments were 
performed at Screening, Day 29 predose, Day 64 predose, Day 183 predose, Day 302 predose, and 
Day 394. Body length, head circumference, chest circumference, and arm circumference were 
measured. Ratios of weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and head-to-chest circumference were also 
calculated. 
Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints are as follows: 
•  AEs, including SAEs 
•  Vital signs and weight 
•  Neurological examinations 
• 
Physical examinations 
•  Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
• 
Electrocardiograms 
•  Use of concomitant medications 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
The PK endpoints are as follows: 
•  CSF levels of nusinersen 
• 
Plasma levels of nusinersen 
Plasma and CSF samples were collected for nusinersen PK assessments from all subjects in the study. 
See Table 6 for a schedule of all PK collection times. 
CSF collection occurred predose during the LP procedure on Days 1, 15, 29, 64, 183, and 302. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 49/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Some of the collected PK plasma and CSF samples were retained for investigation of possible 
biomarkers of SMA disease or the pharmacodynamic effects of nusinersen (e.g., CSF mRNA, CSF 
protein) or for profiling of drug binding proteins, metabolite assessments, immunogenicity 
assessments, or to assess other actions of nusinersen with plasma and CSF constituents. 
Immunogenicity Endpoint 
The immunogenicity endpoint is plasma antibodies to nusinersen. 
• 
Sample size 
For the primary endpoint of motor milestone response, the power was estimated to be approximately 
60% to detect a statistically significant difference between treated and sham groups at the time of the 
interim analysis (N~80 subjects), under the assumptions of having 3 responders in the sham group 
(3/26 = 11.5%) and 20 responders in the nusinersen group (20/52 = 38.5%), and alpha = 0.035. At 
the final analysis, with alpha = 0.03, 111 subjects would provide approximately 78% power to 
differentiate a response rate of 38.5% for the nusinersen group versus a response rate of 11.5% for 
the sham group. 
In addition, the sample size for this study was estimated based on a doubling of median time to death 
or permanent ventilation for the nusinersen group compared to that of the sham procedure control 
group. Based on limited available natural history data for the target population (Finkel et al. 2014), it 
was estimated that the median time to death or permanent ventilation of the sham-procedure control 
arm is 5 to 6 months from date of randomisation. With 2:1 randomization and 13 months follow-up 
time, 111 subjects would provide approximately 80% power to detect a doubling in median time to 
death or permanent ventilation for the nusinersen group versus the sham-procedure control group at 
an overall 2-sided 5% significance level. 
• 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised after all screening assessments had been completed and after the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor had verified that they were eligible. Using an Interactive 
Voice/Web-Response System (IXRS), eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive nusinersen or 
sham-procedure control, respectively. The randomization was stratified for disease duration (subject’s 
age at screening - age at symptom onset): ≤ 12 weeks vs. > 12 weeks. 
A permuted block schedule was used in the randomization. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
To allow the study to be blinded, patients who were randomised to the control group underwent a 
sham-procedure. The study drug or sham procedure was administered by dedicated study personnel 
who were unblinded to treatment group; this could not be any of the key study site personnel (i.e., 
the Principal Investigator, study coordinator, or outcomes assessors).  
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 50/117 
  
  
 
 
 
The sham procedure or study drug administration was performed in a dedicated room and the key 
study personnel and the parents were not present during the procedure to ensure blinding. The sham 
procedure consisted of a small needle prick on the lower back at the location where the LP injection 
was normally made. The needle broke the skin but no LP injection or needle insertion occurred. The 
needle prick was covered with the same bandage that was used to cover the LP injection normally, 
thus simulating the appearance of an LP injection. The study subject was kept in the procedure room 
for the same amount of time as subjects administered Study Drug were kept, thus simulating the time 
period of a Study Drug administration procedure. Study Drug and sham kits were packaged in a 
blinded fashion. Blinded kits for sham procedure contained artificial CSF (5.0 mL solution per 6 mL 
vial) that were not injected but were used to simulate CSF samples for that subject. 
The Sponsor, parents of the subjects, and key study site personnel were blinded throughout the study. 
The evaluator (i.e., physical therapist) who performed efficacy evaluations was blinded to study 
treatment and was not involved in decisions about the subjects’ ventilation. Clinicians who were 
making decisions regarding subjects’ ventilation were blinded throughout the study, and did not have 
access to study treatment assignments or efficacy evaluation results. Study personnel involved in 
processing and analysing study samples (e.g., blood, urine) were blinded to treatment assignment. To 
protect against unblinding when analysing blood and CSF samples for drug concentrations and anti-
nusinersen antibodies, dummy identification numbers were assigned by vendors. There were both 
blinded and unblinded monitors in the study. 
Data collected during administration of nusinersen and performance of the sham procedure were 
documented in an unblinded source packet that was kept separate and secured from all other source 
documents and was accessible only to unblinded study staff. 
• 
Statistical methods 
General considerations 
For the interim analysis only the first primary endpoint was formally statistically tested. For all other 
endpoints only summary statistics are presented. Following the positive result at the interim analysis a 
final formal statistical analysis of all endpoints was conducted once the study was completed. 
Analysis populations 
For the interim analysis the following analysis populations were defined: 
ITT Set: All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug/sham 
procedure. Subjects were analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomised. 
Interim Efficacy Set: The subset of subjects in the ITT Set who had the opportunity to be assessed 
at the Day 183 Visit. Specifically, the Interim Efficacy Set included all subjects with a Day 183, Day 
302, or Day 394 Visit and all subjects with a time difference of at least 190 days (183 days plus a 7-
day window) between the date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut-off date of 15 June 2016 for 
the interim analysis (i.e., dosed on or before 09 December 2015). A subject who had died or 
withdrawn was included provided that there was a time difference of at least 176 days (183 days 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 51/117 
  
  
 
 
 
minus a 7-day window) between the date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut-off date of 15 June 
2016 for the interim analysis (i.e., dosed on or before 23 December 2015). The interim efficacy set 
was used for the interim analysis of functional endpoints such as motor milestones. 
Safety Set: All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug/sham 
procedure. The analyses of safety data were based on the Safety Set. Subjects randomized to receive 
sham procedure but incorrectly treated with nusinersen were counted in the nusinersen group from 
the first dose of nusinersen received. 
PK Set: All subjects who were randomized and had at least 1 evaluable post-baseline PK sample. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoints were ranked as follows: 
1. Proportion of motor milestone responders. 
2. Time to death or permanent ventilation. 
Proportion of motor milestone responders 
Initially, the main efficacy analysis presented for assessment were the percentages of motor 
milestones responders in the Interim Efficacy Set. The analysis was based on non-missing values at 
the later of the Day 183, Day 302, and Day 394 assessments. Subjects who died or withdrew from the 
study were counted as non-responders.  
Baseline is defined as the measurement taken during the screening period. 
A motor milestones responder was defined as follows: 
(i) The subject demonstrated at least a 2-point increase in the motor milestones category of ability to 
kick or achievement of maximal score on that category (touching toes), or a 1-point increase in the 
motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking, AND 
(ii) among the 7 motor milestone categories (with the exclusion of voluntary grasp), the subject 
demonstrated improvement in more categories than worsening. 
As the number of responders was less than 5 in the control group, the difference in the percentage of 
responders between the nusinersen and sham-procedure groups was compared using Fisher’s exact 
test, and an exact unconditional confidence interval for the difference in proportions was calculated. 
Four sensitivity analyses were planned. Two (numbers one and four) were not relevant, as there were 
no patients who did not die or withdraw but who had no assessment on days 183, 302 or 394 and no 
patients who received the incorrect treatment. The other two sensitivity analyses considered different 
definitions of motor milestones responder: 
For sensitivity analysis 2 a motor milestones responder was defined as follows: 
(i) Subject demonstrates at least a 2-point increase in the motor milestones category of ability to kick 
or achievement of maximal score on that category (touching toes), or a 1-point increase in the motor 
milestones category of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking, AND 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 52/117 
  
  
 
 
 
(ii) Among the 7 motor milestone categories (with the exclusion of voluntary grasp), the changes from 
baseline in total motor milestones score is at least 1 point. The total motor milestones score is 
calculated as the sum of scores across motor milestone categories, where 0 is the lowest possible 
score within each motor milestones category. 
For sensitivity analysis 3 a motor milestones responder was defined as follows: a 2-point increase in 
the total motor milestones score, where voluntary grasp is excluded. 
Time to death or permanent ventilation 
Permanent ventilation was defined as tracheostomy or ≥16 hours of ventilatory support per day 
continuously for >21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event. Time to death or permanent 
ventilation was determined in a blinded fashion by a central, independent EAC. 
The date of first dose/sham administration was used as the reference time point. If the date of first 
dose/sham administration was incomplete, the date of randomization was used. 
At the interim analysis, the second primary endpoint of time to death or permanent ventilation was 
descriptively reported. In particular, the median times to death or permanent ventilation was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The proportion of subjects who met such an event was 
estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. The hazard ratio (nusinersen versus sham) was calculated 
based on the Cox regression model adjusted for disease duration at Screening; no confidence interval 
for the hazard ratio was provided. The analyses for this endpoint were performed in the ITT 
Population. 
Interim analysis 
The interim analysis was planned for when approximately 80 subjects had the opportunity to be 
assessed at the day 183 visit and was conducted with a clinical cut-off date of 15 June 2016.  
At the interim analysis only the first primary endpoint, proportion of milestone responders, was tested. 
To control the type I error rate across the interim and potential final analysis this was pre-specified to 
be tested at an alpha of 0.032 based on the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function.  
Results  
• 
Recruitment Participant flow 
A total of 149 subjects were screened of whom 122 were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
nusinersen (81 subjects) or undergo a sham procedure (41 subjects in this control group). As of the 
data cut-off (15 June 2016), enrolment is complete. Apart from the one subject randomised to receive 
nusinersen who was withdrawn from the study prior to receiving study treatment, all subjects received 
study treatment according to their randomization assignment.  
The 121 subjects randomised and dosed, and who comprise the ITT Population, were enrolled at 31 
sites in 13 countries. Fifty-four subjects (45%) were enrolled at 12 sites in the United States, 11

subjects (9%) at 2 sites in Spain, and 10 subjects (8%) at 2 sites in Germany, which together account 
for 62% of the population. With the exception of Japan, in which a separate randomization scheme 
was used, subjects were randomized across sites, i.e., centrally, resulting in an imbalance at some 
sites in the intended ratio of 2:1 of nusinersen to control. 
As of the data cut-off date of 15 June 2016, of the 121 subjects who received treatment, 22 (18%) 
completed the study (19% of subjects in the nusinersen group and 17% of subjects in the control 
group). The rate of treatment discontinuation was lower in the nusinersen group (16%) than the 
control group (29%). Twelve out of 80 subjects (15%) in the nusinersen group and 12 out of 41 
subjects (29%) in the control group experienced an adverse event with a fatal outcome. One 
additional subject in the nusinersen group was withdrawn from the study and discontinued treatment. 
One additional subject in the control group was withdrawn from the study after undergoing all the 
scheduled sham procedures. As of the data cut-off date, 52 out of 80 subjects (65%) in the 
nusinersen group and 21 out of 41 subjects (51%) in the control group were continuing in the study.  
Shortly after the data cut-off date, 1 additional death of a subject in the control group occurred and 
was reported to the Sponsor. The death was due to an AE that began prior to data cut-off. This 
subject is included in all analyses of death. The decision to include this death was made prior to the 
unblinding of the study.

Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviations occurred in 15% of subjects and were balanced across treatment groups. 
Less than 1% (i.e., 1 subject each) had visit schedule deviations, enrolment criteria deviations, or 
procedure deviations; and 12% had deviations listed as “other.” Note that deviations listed under 
“other” as miscalculations of disease duration by the study sites did not affect statistical analyses 
because analyses using disease duration were made using actual dates of symptom onset and not on 
study site calculations. Overall, none of the deviations were considered to affect the analysis of the 
study results or the conclusions. 
• 
Baseline data 
Overall, the demographic and baseline disease characteristics and SMA history of the ITT Population is 
consistent with a population highly likely to develop Type I SMA. At baseline, subjects in the 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 55/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
nusinersen treatment group had a younger age of SMA symptom onset than the sham-procedure 
control group (median of 6.5 weeks vs. 8 weeks), required more ventilatory support (26% vs. 15%) 
and exhibited more severe symptoms of SMA such as paradoxical breathing (89% vs. 66%), 
pneumonia or respiratory symptoms (35% vs. 22%), and swallowing or feeding difficulties (51% vs. 
29%). 
Of the 121 subjects in the ITT Population, 67 (55%) were female and 54 (45%) were male. Age at 
first study treatment ranged from 30 to 262 days (median 175 days). One hundred and four (86%) 
subjects were white. 
Baseline demography was balanced between the nusinersen and control groups with the exception of 
age and geographic region. Subjects in the nusinersen group were on average younger than those in 
the control group. A greater percentage of subjects in the control group were from North America 
(54% versus 48%) and Europe (41% versus 38%), while a greater percentage of subjects in the 
nusinersen group were from the Asia-Pacific region (15% versus 5%). 
Both groups were balanced with respect to disease duration and SMN2 copy number. Disease duration 
was 12 weeks or less for 43% of the subjects and greater than 12 weeks for 57% of subjects. Median 
disease duration was 13.1 weeks. Ninety eight percent of subjects were documented to have 2 copies 
of the SMN2 gene. 
There was some imbalance in age at symptom onset with 90% of subjects in the nusinersen group 
and 78% in the control group experiencing symptoms of SMA within the first 12 weeks of life. Median 
age at symptom onset was 6.5 weeks in the nusinersen group, and 8 weeks in the control group. 
A greater percentage of infants in the nusinersen group had a history of paradoxical breathing 
(nusinersen vs control: 89% vs. 66%), pneumonia or respiratory symptoms (35% vs. 22%), and 
swallowing or feeding difficulties 51% vs. 29%. 
At baseline the majority of subjects had achieved few or no motor milestones. Eighty one percent of 
subjects were unable to maintain their head upright, 73% were unable to kick, 95% could not roll, and 
97% could not sit. No subject was able to crawl, stand, or walk. 
Baseline CHOP-INTEND total scores were similar between the control and nusinersen groups ranging 
from 8.00 to 50.50, with a median of 28.00 (64 is the maximum possible score). 
The groups were balanced with respect to CMAP measurements at baseline. Peroneal amplitude at 
baseline ranged from 0.00 to 1.50 mV (median 0.30 mV) with 75% of the population having 
amplitudes of 0.5 mV or less. Baseline ulnar amplitude ranged from 0.00 to 0.87 mV (median 0.20 
mV) with 75% of the population having amplitudes of 0.30 or less. 
Weight-for-age percentiles (based on World Health Organization Child Growth Standards, 2006), a key 
measure for growth assessment, ranged from 0.57 to 97.78 (median 14.92) at baseline. 
Of the 121 subjects treated, 27 (22%) required ventilatory support at baseline, with a greater 
percentage of subjects in the nusinersen group requiring such support (26% vs 15%). 
Mean time on ventilatory support ranged from 1 to 20 hours (median 8 hours) in the nusinersen group 
and from 1 to 12 hours (median 7 hours) in the control group.

There were 121 patients in the ITT population, 80 treated with nusinersen and 41 who underwent the 
sham procedure. As all treated subjects received correct intervention the ITT and safety populations 
were identical.  
The interim efficacy set (IES) included all subjects who had the opportunity to be assessed at the day 
183 visit based on the data cut-off date (i.e. they were dosed early enough such that their day 183 
visit had been reached by the time of the data cut-off for the interim analysis). This comprised 78 
subjects, 51 treated with ISIS and 27 who received the sham intervention. 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
First primary endpoint - motor milestone response 
Motor milestones were assessed using Section 2 of the HINE. Eight categories of motor milestones are 
evaluated, including voluntary grasp, head control, ability to kick, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, 
and walking, with 2 to 4 milestones that can be achieved within each category. Voluntary grasp, a 
category in which none of the milestones require movement against gravity, was excluded from the 
analysis as some infants with SMA can acquire all milestones in this category. 
While attainment of motor milestones is a desired outcome, some infants with SMA can acquire 
milestones but subsequently lose them. A subject is considered to have responded if the number of 
motor milestone categories in which there was an improvement from baseline was greater than the 
number that showed worsening. 
There were 21 (41%) subjects in the nusinersen group with a motor mile response at their last 
possible visit (day 183, 302 or 394 depending on the date they were treated), compared to 0/27 
patients on control. This was highly statistically significant (p<0.0001 from Fisher’s exact test). 
The results remained statistically significant when looking at each visit individually.

The data supports the position that  nusinersen-treated subjects achieved progressive and sustained 
increases in total motor milestone over time compared to baseline whereas control group subjects

EMA/289068/2017 
Page 58/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
showed slight improvement at the first assessment (Day 64) followed by a decrease over time. The 
loss of motor milestones gained prior to symptom onset, as seen in the control group, is consistent 
with the natural history of Type I SMA, while a gain in motor milestones after symptom onset, as seen 
in the nusinersen group, is highly inconsistent with Type I SMA natural history. 
Figure 6: 
Efficacy Set 
Figure of Total Motor Milestones Over Time: Mean Results - Interim 
Some significant motor milestones were achieved by subjects in the nusinersen group. Nine of the 51 
subjects (18%) in the nusinersen group achieved full head control (i.e., the ability to maintain their 
head upright all the time) versus none in the control group. This is not typically seen in patients with 
Type I SMA. Independent sitting, i.e., achievement of stable sit or pivoting, was seen in 5 (10%) of 
nusinersen-treated subjects and none in the control group. The inability to achieve independent sitting 
is part of the definition of Type I SMA. Standing is never seen in patients with Type I SMA yet 1 
subject (2%) in the nusinersen group managed to achieve standing with support. 
It is worthwhile to note that although a large treatment difference in favour of nusinersen was 
observed across subgroups, it is true that a greater treatment benefit was seen in subjects with 
shorter disease duration at the start of the study.

Second primary endpoint - Event-Free Survival (time to death or permanent ventilation) 
In accordance with the statistical analysis plan the second primary efficacy endpoint, time to death or 
permanent ventilation, was not formally tested statistically at the time of interim analysis. However, a 
description of the results was provided. 
There were 27/80 (34%) patients who died or required permanent ventilation on nusinersen 
compared to 20/41 (49%) on control. There were 12/80 (15%) deaths on nusinersen, compared to 13 
(32%) on control. 
From the Kaplan-Meier curve the estimated proportion of patients who died or required permanent 
ventilation by day 182 was 0.520 on control compared to 0.315 on nusinersen.  
This endpoint was not formally analysed as part of the interim analysis, but the trend favoured 
nusinersen over control, with an observed hazard ratio of 0.71 for time to death or permanent 
ventilation, and a hazard ratio of 0.44 for time to death.

Figure 8: 
Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time to Death or Permanent Ventilation 
(EAC-Adjudicted Events) ITT Set 
A subject is considered to have received permanent ventilation if a tracheostomy was performed or at 
least 16 hours of ventilator support per day continuously for more than 21 days was required in the 
absence of an acute reversible event. 
None of the subjects required permanent ventilation at baseline. Compared to the control group, the 
estimated percentage of subjects requiring permanent ventilation in the nusinersen group was higher 
early in the study (14.9% versus 6.2%, respectively, by Study Day 91) but consistently lower later in 
the study. 
Using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for each subject’s disease duration at screening 
resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.90, indicating a 10% reduction in the risk of permanent ventilation 
following treatment with nusinersen. 
Secondary Endpoint - CHOP INTEND 
At baseline, the distribution of the total score was comparable to that of the ITT Population: in the 
nusinersen group, baseline total score ranged from 8.5 to 48.5 (median, 27.50), and from 10.5 to 
50.5 (median, 28.50) in the control group. At the later of the Day 183, Day 302, and Day 394 visits, 
71% of nusinersen-treated infants had shown improvement with 65% achieving at least a 4-point 
improvement from baseline (a secondary endpoint of the study), and 61% showing an improvement 
of at least 6 points. In contrast, 52% of subjects in the control group showed some degree of 
worsening, with 44% worsening by 4 points or more. Subjects who died or were withdrawn from the 
study were considered non-responders.

Figure 9 :  Waterfall Plot for CHOP INTEND Change from Baseline to Later of Day 
183, Day 302, and Day 394 Study Visit - Interim Efficacy Set 
Secondary Endpoint - Compound Muscle Action Potential 
Baseline CMAP measurements were consistent with that of a symptomatic Type I SMA population. 
Ulnar amplitude ranged from 0.00 to 0.80 mV (median 0.20 mV) in the nusinersen group and from 
0.10 to 0.60 mV (median 0.20 mV) in the control group. Peroneal amplitude ranged from 0.00 to 1.50 
mV (median 0.30 mV) in the nusinersen group and from 0.00 to 1.30 mV (median 0.205 mV) in the 
control group. 
The secondary endpoint based on CMAP defined a subject as responding if the peroneal amplitude 
increased to, or was maintained at, 1 mV or more compared to baseline. 
Of the 51 subjects in the nusinersen group, 18 (35%) responded versus none in the control group. 
Indeed 10 subjects (20%) had an improvement of 1 mV or more with 2 subjects (4%) having 
improved by at least 2 mV. At the Day 183, 302, and 394 Visits, 25%, 25%, and 39% of nusinersen-
treated subjects had responded whereas none in the control group had done so. 
Tertiary Endpoint - Serious Respiratory Events 
Serious respiratory events included all SAEs coded into the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders SOC, either as their primary or secondary SOC. 
A greater percentage of subjects in the nusinersen group experienced serious respiratory events 
(nusinersen vs. control: 73% vs. 67%), the duration of observation was twice as long (37.7 vs. 17.9 
years), resulting in a lower annualized rate with nusinersen (2.836 vs. 3.065 serious respiratory 
events per year. 
Tertiary Endpoint - Number of Hours of Ventilatory Support 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 62/117 
  
  
 
 
The median percentage of time on ventilatory support was lower in the nusinersen group (27.1%) 
compared with the control group (43.0%). The ranges were similar in each group 0% to 95.2% and 
0% to 91.5% in the nusinersen and control groups, respectively. 
Tertiary Endpoint - Number and Length of Hospitalizations 
Of the time on study, subjects in the nusinersen group spent a lower percentage of time in hospital 
(ranging from 0 to 50%, median 8.86%) compared to control (ranging from 0% to 75%, median 
13.87%). 
Growth Parameters 
Similar trends of improvement were observed in both groups in the majority of growth parameters. 
Final results of the study CS3B 
During the assessment process, the final results from study CS3B became available and were 
submitted by the applicant. The below paragraphs describe the relevant findings: 
Subject Accountability: 
A total of 149 subjects were screened of whom 122 were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
nusinersen (81 subjects) or undergo a sham procedure (41 subjects in this control group). One 
subject randomized to receive nusinersen was withdrawn before receiving study treatment. The 121 
subjects randomized and dosed, and who compose the ITT Population, were enrolled at 31 sites in 13 
countries. Fifty-four subjects (45%) were enrolled at 12 sites in the United States, 11 subjects (9%) 
at 2 sites in Spain, and 10 subjects (8%) at 2 sites in Germany, which together account for 62% of 
the population. Of the 121 subjects who received treatment, 89 (74%) completed the study (81% of 
subjects in the nusinersen group and 59% of subjects in the control group).  
Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics: 
Overall, the demographic and baseline disease characteristics and SMA history of the ITT Population is 
consistent with a population highly likely to develop Type I SMA. 
Efficacy Results: 
• 
The analysis of the first primary endpoint was done for the interim analysis. A statistically 
significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved a motor milestone response in the 
nusinersen group (41%) compared to the control group (0%; p<0.0001). In the final analysis, 
this percentage improved; 51% of subjects in the nusinersen group achieved a response 
compared to 0% in the control group (p<0.0001). Responders were subjects with a greater 
number of motor milestone categories with improvement than worsening. Subjects who died 
or were withdrawn from the study are considered non-responders. A consistent and 
statistically significant effect was observed across the group of sensitivity analyses. A 
CHMP Assessment report

Page 63/117 
  
  
 
 
treatment effect was evident in the pre-specified subgroups based on disease duration, age at 
onset of symptoms of SMA, and geographic region. 
•  Among the non-responders, most subjects in the nusinersen group experienced improvement 
in CHOP INTEND and CMAP while the non-responders in the sham control group experienced 
declines. 
•  As of the data cut-off date, in the nusinersen group (n=73), 16 subjects (22%) achieved full 
head control, 6 subjects (8%) achieved independent sitting, and 1 subject (1%) achieved 
standing with support, whereas no subjects in the control group (n=37) achieved any of these 
milestones. 
• 
Time to death or permanent ventilation was significantly prolonged in subjects treated with 
nusinersen. Overall, there was a 47% reduction in the risk of death or permanent ventilation 
compared to control. Notably, nusinersen-treated subjects who were below the median for 
disease duration at baseline had a markedly decreased risk of death or permanent ventilation 
(76% reduction in risk) compared with control subjects who were below the median, 
suggesting that early treatment with nusinersen may confer a strong benefit for event-free 
survival. 
• 
There was a trend toward a lower percentage of subjects in the nusinersen group requiring 
permanent ventilation during the study compared with the control group. Overall, the risk of 
permanent ventilation was 34% lower in nusinersen-treated subjects than in those who 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 64/117 
  
  
 
 
received the sham procedure even though subjects randomized to nusinersen required more 
ventilatory support and had more history of pulmonary disease at baseline 
•  Subjects who received nusinersen but required permanent ventilation continued to show 
improvement in motor function, whereas subjects in the control group who required 
permanent ventilation showed no improvement in motor function. 
•  A significantly lower percentage of subjects in the nusinersen group died compared with the 
control group. Overall, the risk of death was 62.8% lower in nusinersen-treated subjects than 
in those who received the sham procedure even though subjects randomized to nusinersen 
were younger at symptom onset and had more difficulty swallowing and feeding at baseline, 
all of which confer a worse prognosis for survival. 
•  A statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved a CHOP INTEND response 
in the nusinersen group (71%) compared to the control group (3%; p<0.0001). Several 
nusinersen-treated infants had improvements of 10 points or more in CHOP INTEND total 
score, but only one in the control group showed improvement. With the exception of this one 
subject, all subjects in the control group showed no change or worsened. 
•  Sustained and clinically significant increases of mean CMAP amplitude of the peroneal and 
ulnar nerves were observed in the nusinersen group compared with the control group. 
Through Day 64 (i.e., during the loading-dose period) little separation was observed between 
the groups, however by Day 183, the nusinersen group was improving steadily, while the 
control group remained at baseline levels or below. 
• 
• 
• 
There was a trend toward a lower annualized rate of serious respiratory events in subjects 
who received nusinersen (2.570) than in subjects who received the sham procedure (4.031). 
There was a trend toward a lower proportion of time spent on ventilator support in 
nusinersen- treated infants compared to control. 
The rate of hospitalization and the proportion of time in hospital were lower in subjects treated 
with nusinersen. 
•  Absolute length and weight improved for subjects receiving nusinersen. Subjects receiving 
nusinersen appear to have a slower rate of growth compared to age matched controls whereas 
subjects in the control group have an increased rate of growth over time. The greater increase 
in mean chest circumference from baseline in subjects in the nusinersen group compared to 
the control group is noteworthy because this increase likely indicates a decrease in chest 
deformities seen in patients with SMA.

Analysis description  Secondary analysis  
There were several sensitivity analysis performed for both primary and 
secondary endpoints. A consistent effect was observed across sensitivity 
analyses conducted. 
Study CS4  
This is a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Procedure Controlled Study to Assess the Clinical 
Efficacy and Safety of ISIS 396443 Administered Intrathecally in Patients With Later-Onset Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy [CHERISH]. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in Hammersmith Functional 
Motor Scale –  Expanded (HFMSE) score at 15 months. Secondary efficacy endpoints of the study were 
as follows: 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieve a 3-point or greater increase from baseline in 
•  HFMSE score at 15 months 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestone at 15 months 
•  Number of motor milestones achieved per subject at 15 months 
•  Change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test at 15 months 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieve standing alone at 15 months 
Proportion of subjects who achieve walking with assistance at 15 months 
The total duration of subject participation in the study was approximately 16 months and consisted of 
a Screening Period (up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (9 months), and a Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Period (6 months). Eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a 12-mg dose of 
nusinersen or a sham-procedure control, respectively. Randomization was stratified based on the 
subject’ s age at Screening (<6 years vs. ≥ 6 years). 
Interim results submitted from  this ongoing, randomized, controlled, double-blind study of nusinersen 
in 126 subjects with later-onset SMA show that subjects treated intrathecally with nusinersen achieved 
sustained and clinically meaningful benefits compared with a control group of subjects who received a 
sham procedure. These benefits included statistically significant greater gains in motor function as 
measured by HFMSE, as well as an improvement in upper limb functional ability.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HFMSE score at 15 months. The 
HFMSE is a tool used to assess motor function in children with SMA. An improvement of ≥3 points in 
HFMSE is considered to represent a clinically meaningful improvement. A statistically significant 
change from baseline in HFMSE score was observed in the nusinersen group (4.0 (95% CI: 2.9-5.1)) 
compared to the sham control group (-1.9 (95% CI: -3.8-0.0)) (p=0.0000002) (Figure 10). A 
consistent effect was observed across all sensitivity analyses conducted, including an analysis based 
on observed Month 15 values.

Figure 10 HFMSE: Mean change from baseline (multiple imputation) over time 
using LSmeans estimates – ITT Set 
• 
• 
•  A greater improvement in HFMSE scores was seen in the nusinersen group compared to the 
control group at all timepoints from Month 3 to Month 15. Earlier and greater gains were 
observed among subjects who were <6 years of age at study entry and subjects with shorter 
disease duration. Older subjects and subjects with a longer disease duration in the nusinersen 
group appeared to stabilize or improve in motor function at later timepoints. It may be that in 
older subjects and in subjects with longer disease duration, the rate of change in motor 
function is slower so that it takes longer for an improvement to be observed. 
The proportion of subjects who achieved a 3-point or greater increase from baseline in HFMSE 
score at 15 months in the nusinersen and control groups was 57.3% versus 20.5%, 
respectively, for a difference of 36.8% in favour of the nusinersen group. 
The proportion of subjects achieving new WHO motor milestones in the nusinersen and control 
groups was 17.1% and 10.5%, respectively, for a difference of 6.6% in favour of the 
nusinersen group. At 15 months, none of the 35 subjects in the nusinersen group had lost 1 or 
more motor milestones as compared to the control group in which 4 of 19 subjects (21%) had 
lost a motor milestone. In the ≥6 years of age subgroup, no subjects (0 of 3 subjects) in the 
nusinersen group had lost a motor milestone compared to 2 of 2 subjects  (100%) in the 
control group. 
The number of new motor milestones achieved per subject at Month 15 was slightly higher in 
the nusinersen group, with a least squares mean difference of 0.3 between the 2 groups. 
There was a greater improvement in Upper Limb Module Test scores from baseline to Month 
15 in the nusinersen group (least squares mean change of 3.7) than in the control group 
(least squares mean change of 0.3), with a least squares mean difference of 3.4 between the 
2 groups. 
• 
• 
•  One subject in the control group achieved standing alone at 15 months and 1 subject in the 
nusinersen group achieved walking with assistance at 15 months. The most commonly 
achieved new milestone in the nusinersen group at levels higher than in the control group was 
hands-and-knees crawling. Gains in HFMSE scores became apparent before gains in WHO 
motor milestones. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 71/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
•  A consistently higher proportion of subjects in the nusinersen group were rated as much 
improved or having any improvements compared to the control group at all timepoints in the 
Investigator and caregiver CGI assessments. 
The unadjusted annualized rates of disease-related AEs and hospitalizations were lower in the 
nusinersen group than in the control group.  
• 
As of the data cut-off date in this ongoing study, nusinersen was well tolerated when administered as 
multiple IT injections. No specific safety concerns were identified in the overall safety profile of 
nusinersen. 
Supportive studies 
The development plan comprised of several supportive studies: in infantile-onset SMA (Study CS3A), 
later-onset  SMA  (Type  II  and  Type  III)  -  CS1,  CS4,  CS10,  CS2,  and  CS12,  and  in  infants  with  pre-
symptomatic SMA (SM201). 
Study CS3A 
Study CS3A, a Phase 2, open-label study of nusinersen, is being conducted at 4 centres in the United 
States and Canada.  
Enrolment in CS3A was complete at time of assessment: 23 subjects with infantile-onset SMA were 
screened; 21 were enrolled, and 20 were dosed with nusinersen. Four subjects in Cohort 1 received 6 
mg loading doses and 12 mg maintenance doses, and 16 subjects in Cohort 2 received 12 mg loading 
and maintenance doses. As of the last data cut-off (26 January 2016), 15 of 20 subjects (75%) were 
alive and continuing in the study. One subject had voluntarily withdrawn from the study, and 4 
subjects had died of SMA-related causes. 
• 
The demographics and SMA history of the subjects in Study CS3A were similar to those of the 
subjects in CS3B and consistent with a Type I SMA population. 
o  Most subjects were male (60%) and white (80%) 
o  Sixteen of 20 subjects (80%) had symptom onset at <12 weeks of age and were 
classified as Type IB. Four subjects (20%) were Type IC (symptom onset >12 weeks 
of age. Subject age ranged from 21 to 154 days (median 56 days) at SMA symptom 
onset; from 0 to 154 days (median 81 days) at diagnosis of SMA; and from 36 to 210 
days (median 155 days) at study enrolment 
o  17 of 20 subjects (85%) had 2 copies of the SMN2 gene (all 4 subjects in Cohort 1 and 
13 subjects in Cohort 2); 2 subjects had 3 copies of the SMN2 gene; and 1 subject 
died before determination of SMN2 gene copy number was completed 
•  Subjects had received a median of 7 (range 2 to 9) doses at the time of data cut-off. The time 
on study ranged from 62 to 988 days (median 670 days); 15 subjects (75%) were on study 
for at least 505 days (72 weeks). Across both cohorts, the total time on study was 32.9 
subject-years. 
• 
The ages of the subjects continuing in the study at data cut-off ranged from 24.6 to 39.2 
months with a median of 29.6 months 
Results of efficacy assessments conducted as of the cut-off date demonstrated continued improvement 
for over 2 years, which is inconsistent with the natural history of Type I SMA: 
CHMP Assessment report

• 
In contrast to the natural history of SMA where there is a failure to achieve motor milestones 
after symptom onset, sustained and clinically significant improvements in HINE motor 
milestones were observed in both dose cohorts over time. 
o  Motor milestones increased steadily over time from a baseline mean of 2.25 
milestones, with mean increases of 0.53, 1.78, 3.76, 4.80, and 9.40 milestones on 
Days 29, 92, 253, 379, and 694, respectively. 
o  13 of 20 subjects (65%) met the primary endpoint of protocol-defined achievement of 
new motor milestones. 
o  9 subjects (45%) achieved full head control, 8 subjects (40%) developed the ability to 
sit independently, 5 subjects (25%) gained the ability to stand with support or 
independently, and 2 subjects (10%) gained the ability to walk with support or. 
• 
In contrast with the decline associated with Type I SMA [Kolb 2016a], sustained and clinically 
significant improvements in mean CHOP INTEND total scores were observed in both dose 
cohorts over time 
o  At the time of the last visit for each subject prior to data cut-off, subjects had 
achieved a mean improvement of 14 points in CHOP INTEND total score  
o  11 of 20 subjects (55%) met the secondary endpoint of an increase in total CHOP 
INTEND score of ≥4 points at the time of data cut-off. 
•  Sustained improvements of mean CMAP amplitude of the ulnar and peroneal nerve were 
observed in both dose cohorts over time. 
o  Subjects experienced a mean increase of 0.753 mV in ulnar amplitude and 1.85 mV in 
peroneal amplitude at Day 694. 
o  13 of 20 subjects (65%) had improvement of >0.5 mV in peroneal amplitude as of the 
last visit prior to the data cut-off date. 
• 
• 
Increases from baseline were observed in all growth parameters measured. However, most 
subjects were receiving supplemental nutrition by G-tube or other means during the study. 
Fifteen of 20 subjects (75%) were alive and continuing in the study at the time of the data 
cut-off. Of these 15 subjects, all were >24 months of age, 7 were >30 months of age, and 2 
were >36 months of age. 
•  13 subjects (65%) were alive, free from permanent ventilation, and continuing in the study at 
the time of data cut-off. A median time to event-free survival could not be estimated due to 
an insufficient number of events. 
•  After the data cut-off, 1 additional subject had died at 3 years of age, and 1 subject met the 
criteria for permanent ventilation at 3.5 years of age. 
−  Efficacy results from CS3A showed that subjects who have received nusinersen treatment for 
over 2 years have achieved clinically meaningful gains in motor milestones, prolonged overall 
and event-free survival, and improved motor function and motor neuronal health inconsistent 
with the natural history of Type I SMA.

−  The  earlier  onset  and  greater  magnitude  of  the  improvements  in  subjects  who  received  the 
12-mg  loading  dose  (Cohort  2)  compared  with  those  who  received  the  6-mg  loading  dose 
(Cohort  1)  are  indicative  of  greater  nusinersen  exposure  from  the  higher  loading  dose  for 
subjects in Cohort 2. 
Study CS1 
Study CS1 was a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of a single dose of nusinersen administered IT in subjects with SMA who were 2 to 
14 years of age and who were medically stable. The study consisted of 4 dose cohorts who received 
nusinersen at a dose of 1 mg (n=6); 3 mg (n=6), 6 mg (n=6), and 9 mg (n=10). Subjects in the 1mg 
cohort of Study CS1 were eligible to continue into Study CS2. 
Subjects receiving 3, 6, or 9 mg were eligible to enrol in Study CS10. 
•  Most subjects (61%) were female and white (82%) 
• 
The mean age of subjects was 6.1 years with a range of 2 to 14 years 
•  15 subjects (54%) had Type II SMA and 13 (46%) had Type III SMA 
•  25 subjects (89%) had 3 SMN2 copies, 2 subjects (7%) had 4 copies, and 1 subject (4%) had 
5 copies 
•  18 subjects (64%) were non-ambulatory at baseline and 10 (36%) were ambulatory 
•  A dose-dependent improvement in HFMSE total score was observed, with a mean increase 
from baseline of 3.1 points (17.6%) at Day 85 at the highest dose evaluated (9 mg) 
•  7 of 10 subjects in the 9-mg dose cohort exhibited a clinically meaningful improvement of ≥3 
points in the HFMSE 
Study CS10 
Study CS10 was an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single dose of 
nusinersen (6 or 9 mg) administered IT by LP in subjects with SMA who previously participated in 
CS1. Of the 28 eligible subjects from CS1, 18 enrolled in CS10. 
Four subjects received 6 mg of nusinersen and 14 subjects received 9 mg of nusinersen in CS10. 
Following their participation in CS10, subjects were eligible to enrol in Study CS12. 
•  Most subjects were female (72%) and white (83%) 
• 
The mean age of subjects was 6.6 years with a range of 2 to 11 years 
•  10 subjects (56%) had Type II SMA and 8 subjects (44%) had Type III SMA 
•  17 subjects (94%) had 3 SMN2 copies and 1 subject (6%) had 4 copies 
•  12 subjects (67%) were non-ambulatory and 6 (33%) were ambulatory 
CHMP Assessment report

•  Dose dependent changes in HFMSE score were observed, with greater increases in subjects 
who had received 9 mg in CS1 compared to the subjects who received 3 and 6 mg in CS1. 
•  Significant improvement (p=0.008) relative to baseline in HFMSE scores was maintained 
throughout CS10 for subjects who received 9 mg in CS1 
Study CS2 
Study CS2 was a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of nusinersen in 2- to 15-year-old subjects with SMA. Eight subjects were 
enrolled in each of the 3- and 6-mg dose cohorts, and 9 subjects were enrolled in each of the 9- and 
12-mg dose cohorts. Six subjects had previously been treated in Study CS1. 
•  Overall, 59% of subjects were male and 88% of subjects were white  
•  Age ranged from 2 to 15 years with a mean of 7.4 years 
•  13 subjects (38%) had Type II SMA and 21 (62%) had Type III SMA 
•  1 subject (3%) had 2 SMN2 copies, 25 (74%) had 3 copies, and 8 (23%) had 4 copies 
•  19 subjects (56%) were non-ambulatory and 15 (44%) were ambulatory 
• 
Time-and dose-dependent improvements in mean total HFMSE score were observed, with the 
largest improvements seen in the 9- and 12-mg dose cohorts. Improvement was maintained 
through Day 253 (~6 months after the last dose of study drug). 
•  Dose- and time-dependent increases in the ULM were observed, particularly in the 9-and 12-
mg nusinersen dose cohorts and in subjects with baseline scores within the dynamic range of 
the scale (≤14)  
•  Substantial increases were observed in distance walked as assessed by the 6MWT  
• 
Electrophysiology measurements assessed by CMAP remained stable, suggesting maintenance 
of motor neuronal health 
Study CS12 
Study CS12 is an ongoing Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of repeated doses of nusinersen (12 mg) administered as IT injections by LP to subjects with 
SMA who previously participated in Study CS2 or Study CS10. 
A total of 47 subjects were enrolled and treated; 30 subjects were enrolled from Study CS2 and 17 
were enrolled from CS10. At the time of data cut-off (07 April 2016), 23 subjects had completed the 
study, 2 subjects had withdrawn, and 22 were ongoing. 
• 
There were 49% males and 51% females; most subjects were white (92%) 
•  Age ranged from 3 to 17 years at the time of enrolment with a mean of 8 years 
•  22 subjects (47%) had Type II SMA and 25 (53%) had Type III SMA 
CHMP Assessment report

•  39 subjects (83%) had 3 copies of the SMN2 gene and 8 (17%) had 4 copies 
•  26 subjects (55%) were considered non-ambulatory at Baseline and 21 (45%) were 
considered ambulatory 
• 
Improvement and prevention of worsening of motor function as assessed by HFMSE was 
observed over time 
•  Non-ambulatory subjects had stable upper limb function as measured by the ULM 
• 
• 
• 
There was a progressive increase in total distance walked by the 6MWT up to Day 442 (mean 
increase of 36.56 meters compared to Baseline) 
The mean change from Baseline in the 6MWT was >2× the standard error of the mean (SEM) 
at multiple visits, suggesting a likely difference from 0 change 
Thirteen of 22 subjects were able to walk farther than baseline during the study 
•  3 subjects who were unable to perform the 6MWT at baseline of CS12 were later able to 
complete it. One of these subjects (Type II SMA and 3 SMN2 copies) walked without support 
for the first time in Study CS12. The subject was 12 months of age at symptom onset and 15 
months of age at SMA diagnosis. The subject achieved walking with support at the age of 12 
months and standing without support at the age of 36 months. On his first attempt on Day 
260, the subject walked 51 meters. Distance improved over time and was 150 meters on Days 
533 and 624. 
Study SM201 (also known as CS5) 
Study SM201 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, multicentre, single-arm study to assess the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nusinersen in presymptomatic  SMA. The study is being 
conducted in subjects who were ≤6 weeks of age at the time of enrolment with genetic documentation 
of 5q SMA, 2 or 3 copies of the SMN2 gene, CMAP ≥1 mV, and the absence of signs or symptoms of 
SMA. Up to 25 subjects are planned. Efficacy data available to date indicate that the development and 
achievement of motor milestones for most subjects has been more consistent with normal 
development than with the natural history of Type I SMA. 
At the time of data cut-off for this filing (08 June 2016), 17 subjects had been enrolled and received at 
least 1 dose of nusinersen. All subjects are continuing in the study. Thirteen subjects who have 
received all 4 loading doses or have had the opportunity to complete the Day 64 visit comprise the 
efficacy set. 
•  Most subjects are male (65%) and white (53%). 
•  Age at the first dose ranged from 8 to 42 days with a median of 19 days. 
•  12 of 17 subjects (71%) have 2 copies of the SMN2 gene and 5 subjects (29%) have 3 copies. 
Efficacy data were available for 13 subjects at Day 64, 10 subjects at Day 183, and 5 subjects at Day 
302. Results at the later of these visits demonstrate development that is inconsistent with Type I SMA 
and the experience of subjects’ affected siblings and consistent with age-matched expectations for 
healthy infants.

•  No subjects died or had respiratory intervention (defined as either invasive or non-invasive 
ventilation for ≥6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 consecutive days or tracheostomy). 
•  One subject received ventilation for ≥6 hours/day continuously for ≥1 day (4 to 6 hours for 9 
continuous days) to treat an SAE of respiratory distress. 
•  An increase of at least 4 points in the CHOP INTEND total score compared to Baseline was 
observed for: 
o  7 of 13 subjects (4 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) at Day 64 
o  8 of 10 subjects (5 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) at Day 183 
o  3 of 5 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies at Day 302 
•  A decrease of at least 4 points in CHOP INTEND was observed in 1 subject with 2 SMN2 copies 
on Day 64, prior to the end of the loading dose period 
•  All subjects had age-appropriate motor development as measured by the modified Section 2 of 
the HINE; additional HINE motor milestones compared to Baseline were achieved by: 
o  12 of 13 subjects (9 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) at Day 64 
o  10 of 10 subjects at Day 183 (7 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) 
o  5 of 5 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies at Day 302 
•  69% of subjects had more categories with improvement (defined as ≥2-motor milestone 
increase or attainment of the maximum of touching toes in the category of ability to kick, or 
≥1-motor milestone increase in any of the categories of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, 
standing, or walking) than with worsening in HINE motor milestones at Day 64. 100% of 
subjects met this criterion at Days 183 and 302. 
•  3 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies had a loss of at least 1 motor milestone; however, only 1 
subject had a decrease in the total HINE motor milestones achieved. 
•  Of the 7 subjects at least 7 months of age at the time of data cut-off, 5 subjects (4 with 2 
SMN2 copies and 1 with 3 SMN2 copies) were sitting independently (3 or 4 milestones). Of the 
5 subjects at least 8 months of age, 1 subject with 2 SMN2 copies was standing unaided (3 
milestones). Two other subjects less than 8 months of age were standing with support. (2 
milestones) The one subject at least 11 months of age was walking with support (cruising) (2 
milestones) 
•  At least 1 WHO motor milestone was achieved by: 
o  1 (3 SMN2 copies) of 11 subjects at Day 64 
o  7 (4 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) of 10 subjects at Day 183 
o  4 of 5 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies at Day 302. One subject achieved the WHO motor 
milestone of sitting without support, while 1 subject, who was able to sit without 
support at Day 183, achieved the WHO motor milestones of crawling on hands and 
knees, standing with assistance, and walking with assistance. This subject achieved 
the WHO motor milestone of standing alone at Day 365.

•  All but 1 subject gained weight during the study. 
• 
Four subjects had manifestation of SMA symptoms based on growth failure (defined as weight 
for age below the fifth percentile [based on WHO growth charts] or a decreased growth 
velocity resulting in weight for age falling ≥2 major percentiles over a 6-month period), 
including 1 subject who had a percutaneous gastric tube placement. However, many factors 
unrelated to SMA may contribute to early growth failure in infants. In this regard, the 
presymptomatic status of the subjects in SM201 confounds the assessment of whether growth 
failure is a true manifestation of SMA symptom onset. As all of the subjects with growth failure 
are achieving age-appropriate motor milestones, it is possible that decreased weight velocity 
may be attributed to non-SMA causes. 
• 
Increases from Baseline in mean ulnar nerve CMAP amplitude were observed at Days 64, 183, 
and 302, increases of at least 0.5 mV compared to Baseline were observed in: 
o  7 (4 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) of 11 subjects at Day 64 
o  9 (6 with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 with 3 SMN2 copies) of 10 subjects at Day 183 
o  3 (2 SMN2 copies) of 5 subjects at Day 302 
•  As of the data cut-off date, information had been collected on 3 siblings. These data indicate 
that subject development in SM201 is inconsistent with that of their affected siblings. 
Information on these siblings, as well as additional posthoc sibling data obtained after the data 
cut-off for 6 subjects is provided in the efficacy narratives. 
Updated results provided during the review demonstrate continued improvement over time. No 
subjects have died or required permanent ventilatory support (defined as either invasive or 
noninvasive ventilation for ≥6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 consecutive days or tracheostomy). 
From Baseline to last study visit, the majority of subjects in the interim efficacy set had achieved the 
maximum score for HINE motor milestones in the categories of head control (13 of 18 subjects), 
kicking (13 of 18 subjects), and sitting (10 of 18 subjects). Additionally, 12 of 18 subjects achieved 
independent sitting, 3 of 18 subjects achieved independent standing, and 2 of 18 subjects achieved 
independent walking. Inconsistent with the natural history of Type I SMA, 16 of 18 subjects in the 
Efficacy Set achieved and maintained improvements in the CHOP INTEND total score. Seven of 18 
subjects achieved the highest attainable CHOP INTEND score at the data cut-off date for this interim 
analysis. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Due to differences in the study populations and the resulting study designs and endpoints required, 
efficacy data across all studies could not be integrated and analysed statistically. An overall summary 
has, however, been provided. 
A comparison of motor milestone achievement among the subjects with symptomatic infantile-onset 
SMA and presymptomatic SMA demonstrates the following: 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 78/117 
  
  
 
 
 
•  Greater improvement in motor milestones for subjects with symptomatic infantile-onset SMA 
who received nusinersen in CS3B and CS3A relative to subjects in the control group of CS3B. 
•  A decline in the control group of CS3B consistent with the natural history of Type I SMA. 
•  Similar improvements in motor milestones over time up to 1 year (Day 394) in CS3B and 
CS3A. 
•  Continued benefit in motor milestone achievement over the long term for subjects in Study 
CS3A. 
•  Greater milestone development in presymptomatic subjects in SM201, suggesting that 
initiating nusinersen treatment prior to the onset of symptoms may allow patients to develop 
normally. 
Figure 11:  Total HINE Motor Milestones by Scheduled Visit Day 
The magnitude of motor milestone achievement among nusinersen-treated subjects in Studies CS3B 
and CS3A was also clinically meaningful. The inability to achieve independent sitting distinguishes 
Type I SMA from the less severe phenotypes; standing is never observed in patients with Type I SMA, 
and subjects with Type II SMA do not achieve independent walking. 
In contrast to this natural history and the experience of the subjects in the control group of CS3B, 
subjects with infantile-onset SMA in CS3B and CS3A had achieved the following milestones at the last 
visit prior to data cut-off: 
• 
Full head control: 16 subjects (22%) in CS3B and 9 subjects (45%) in CS3A 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 79/117 
  
  
 
 
 
• 
Independent sitting (either prop, stable sit, or pivot): 6 subjects in CS3B and 8 subjects 
(40%) in CS3A 
•  Rolling (prone to supine or supine to prone): 25 subjects (34%) in CS3B and 7 subjects (35%) 
in CS3A 
•  Standing (with support or unaided): 1 subject (1%) in CS3B and 5 subjects (25%) in CS3A 
•  Walking (holding on or unaided): 2 subjects (10%) in CS3A 
Among the infants with presymptomatic SMA, results of motor milestone development based on HINE 
and WHO criteria support that initiating treatment prior to the onset of symptoms in infants with 
genetically diagnosed SMA has the potential to prevent the impairment of motor function and allow 
infants to develop normally. 
The effect of nusinersen on motor function in later-onset (Type II and Type III) SMA was assessed 
through the HFMSE (ambulatory and non-ambulatory subjects), the ULM (non-ambulatory subjects), 
and the 6MWT (ambulatory subjects) in the longitudinal analysis. 
Although motor function in later-onset SMA was assessed by different endpoints as there is no single 
endpoint that may be applied with consistency throughout the spectrum, the results were consistent 
with those of the measures used in infants and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in 
motor function that was maintained over time,  inconsistent with the natural history data. 
The overall survival was greater in the nusinersen-treated subjects in studies CS3B and CS3A as 
compared to the results from the control group of CS3B. At the time of data cut-off, 29 subjects in 
Study CS3B (16 subjects [43%] in the control group and 13 subjects [18%] in the nusinersen group) 
and 4 subjects (20%) in CS3A had died. The hazard ratio from a Cox proportional hazards model 
adjusting for subject disease duration at screening was 0.37 indicating a 63% reduction in the risk of 
death relative to control with nusinersen treatment. As of the data cut-off for Study CS3A (26 January 
2016), 15 subjects (75%), 13 with 2 SMN2 copies, were alive and continuing in the study. All of these 
subjects were >24 months of age, 7 were >30 months of age, and 2 were >36 months of age. 
Consistent with the definition used in the natural history study by Finkel [Finkel 2014], subjects in 
CS3B and CS3A were considered to have met the criteria for permanent ventilation if they had a 
tracheostomy or they required at least 16 hours of ventilator support per day continuously for more 
than 14 (CS3A) or 21 days (CS3B) in the absence of an acute reversible event. Events were reviewed 
by the study investigators and in CS3B were confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. In 
the control group of CS3B, 13 subjects (32%) met the criteria for permanent ventilation. Among 
nusinersen-treated subjects, 18 subjects (23%) in and 3 subjects (%) in CS3A (CSR CS3A, Table 24) 
met these criteria.  
Overall, the summary of main data across all studies confirms the trend of efficacy seen in the interim 
analysis of the pivotal study. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No trial has been performed including adults at study start.

SMA  was  studied  in  infants  and  children.  The  oldest  subject  was  19  YO  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off 
time. This is adequate, since SMA types 1-3 are conditions that can incorporate infants, children and 
adolescents. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The totality of data across  multiple disease phenotypes of symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA 
provides  consistent evidence of the positive effect of nusinersen in patients with SMA. The effects of 
treatment also appear to be consistent across investigational centres, assessors and multiple 
measures of disease activity. 
Subjects in Studies CS3B and CS3A were identified as having infantile-onset SMA as they were not old 
enough to have achieved the milestone of independent sitting used to distinguish Type I SMA from 
less severe phenotypes. Based on the onset of symptoms at <6 months of age and documentation of 
5q SMA homozygous gene deletion or mutation, it was considered that these subjects would most 
likely develop Type I SMA. While SMN2 copy number was not a pre-specified criterion for enrolment in 
the first study in infantile-onset SMA (CS3A), phenotype testing for SMN2 copy number performed 
after subjects were enrolled determined that 17 of the 20 subjects in CS3A had 2 SMN2 copies, 
consistent with the presumptive classification of Type I SMA. SMN2 copy number was only included as 
an inclusion criterion for studies CS3B and SM201 to improve the homogeneity of the study 
population. As required by the protocol, all subjects in Study CS3B had symptom onset at <6 months 
of age and 2 SMN2 copies and were also considered to represent a Type I SMA population. 
In the context of the rapidly progressive decline observed in natural history studies of Type I SMA and 
observations from the control group of CS3B, the demonstrated benefits of early treatment with 
nusinersen provide strong support for the initiation of treatment as soon as possible after the onset of 
symptoms or the genetic diagnosis of SMA. Such an approach could have the potential to halt further 
disease progression that may occur during the interval between the onset of clinical symptoms and 
genetic confirmation of SMA. Further, as evidenced by the results of SM201 in presymptomatic infants 
with genetically documented SMA, the initiation of nusinersen treatment before the onset of clinical 
symptoms has the potential to delay or even prevent the progression of SMA disease and allow infants 
to develop normally. 
Subjects with infantile-onset SMA treated with nusinersen in Studies CS3B and CS3A have achieved 
clinically meaningful improvements in motor milestones and motor function as compared to those of 
the subjects in the control group of Study CS3B and are well above the expectations for patients with 
Type I SMA receiving standard of care in natural history studies. These improvements include 
attainment of motor milestones such as independent sitting, standing, and walking, which are in stark 
contrast to the steady loss of motor milestones that is the hallmark of Type I SMA demonstrated by 
the control group of Study CS3B and natural history data. 
Improvement relative to control in motor milestones, CHOP INTEND, and CMAP was observed as early 
as Day 64 in Study CS3B; however, due to differences in the sensitivity of some assessments, clear 
separation for some endpoints did not occur until the 6-month visit after the initiation of treatment. 
This suggests that maximum efficacy of nusinersen may not be reached until completion of the loading 
dose regimen of 4 doses over 2 months and further emphasises the importance of early treatment for 
maximum benefit. 
CHMP Assessment report

In symptomatic subjects with infantile onset SMA, where health status is changing rapidly, CMAP and 
CHOP INTEND provide sensitive endpoints that can discern small changes. 
Conversely, endpoints such as motor milestones, permanent ventilation, and event-free survival that 
are more distal from the mechanism of action would not be expected to discern a change quite as 
early as CMAP and CHOP INTEND. 
Electrophysiological measures of neuronal innervation of distal muscle groups assessed by CMAP 
demonstrated improvements in nusinersen-treated subjects that are in direct contrast to the natural 
history of the disease. In addition, the improvement in CMAP was directly linked with the magnitude of 
improvement in motor milestones and motor function in Study CS3A. 
The ongoing studies in infantile-onset SMA support that treatment with nusinersen has the potential to 
prolong overall and event-free survival. Time to death or permanent ventilation was significantly 
prolonged in subjects treated with nusinersen. Overall, there was a 47% reduction in the risk of death 
or permanent ventilation compared to control.  While the median time to death or permanent 
ventilation in the control group of CS3B was consistent with previous natural history studies (median 
of 6 months), a median time to death or permanent ventilation could not be estimated in CS3A due to 
the occurrence of too few events. Subjects in Study CS3A have received long-term treatment with 
nusinersen for close to 3 years. At the time of the data cut-off, 15 subjects (75%) were alive and 
remained in the study. Among these subjects, the youngest was 24.6 months of age, and the oldest 
subject was 39.2 months of age. All 15 subjects in Study CS3A were >2 years of age, which exceeds 
the life expectancy reported for most infants with 2 SMN2 gene copies and symptom onset at <6 
months of age. 
Following the data cut-off for CS3A, 1 subject has died and another has met the criteria for permanent 
ventilation. At the time of this submission, 11 subjects in Study CS3A are alive without permanent 
ventilation, supporting that nusinersen has the potential to both prolong survival and reduce the 
comorbidity of SMA. These subjects continue to achieve motor milestones and experience 
improvement in motor function, and there is no evidence of a lessening of effect over time. 
The results from the studies in infantile-onset SMA are corroborated by the study in pre-symptomatic 
infants with genetically confirmed SMA who are also achieving motor milestones and developing motor 
function that are in contrast to the experience of their siblings with SMA and the natural history of the 
disease. Baseline CHOP INTEND and CMAP scores, as well as motor milestone development, for these 
infants are consistent with those of healthy infants without SMA and support that early treatment, 
even prior to the onset of clinical symptoms, may be warranted for subjects with genetically diagnosed 
SMA. 
Interim results submitted from  study CS4, an ongoing, randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 
nusinersen in 126 subjects with later-onset SMA show that subjects treated intrathecally with 
nusinersen achieved sustained and clinically meaningful benefits compared with a control group of 
subjects who received a sham procedure. These benefits included statistically significant greater gains 
in motor function as measured by HFMSE, as well as an improvement in upper limb functional ability.  
This is supported by results from the longitudinal assessment of subjects with later-onset Type II and 
Type III SMA who first received nusinersen in Study CS2 demonstrate additional milestone attainment 
and maintenance of effect over time in motor function, upper limb strength, and ambulation, all of 
which are in contrast to the decline typically seen in these patients following symptom onset. A 
number of subjects have achieved clinically meaningful improvement in overall motor function and 
CHMP Assessment report

ambulation. Notably, 1 subject with Type II SMA first gained the ability to walk in Study CS12. These 
results were also corroborated by the data provided from study CS4 in later-onset patients. 
Across the broad population of presymptomatic and symptomatic patients included in the clinical 
development program, all of the key clinical outcome endpoints, including multiple functional and 
survival endpoints, move in the same direction of progressive improvement. The consistency among 
the various key clinical outcome endpoints, each of which provide independent measures central to 
the pathology of SMA, support significant efficacy in both symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects 
and across infantile-onset and later-onset SMA. 
The evidence for maintenance of efficacy in the long term was not available as a part of this 
submission and post-authorisation measures have been requested to address this.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The majority of treated infants with infantile-onset SMA achieved improvement, with a great 
proportion reaching a clinically meaningful and continued improvements in motor milestones (e.g. 
independent sitting, standing and walking), muscle strength, and motor function that exceed those of 
the sham control-treated infants in Study CS3B and the natural history of the disease, where a 
progressive loss of motor function is observed. Data from treated pre-symptomatic infants with 
genetically confirmed SMA show that they are achieving motor milestones and developing muscle 
strength and motor function with the nusinersen treatment that are more consistent with those of 
normal infants than symptomatic infants with SMA. Subjects with later-onset SMA who received 
nusinersen achieved and maintained motor function across multiple measures and milestones such as 
the ability to walk that are completely inconsistent with natural history. 
The difference in magnitude across endpoints is in alignment with the understanding of the pathology 
of SMA, where deficiency in SMN protein leads to disease progression from events more proximal to 
the action of SMN such as declines in motor neuron health as measured by CMAP and CHOP INTEND, 
through those that are more distal, as measured by motor milestones and event-free survival. 
Data from the ongoing studies in infantile-onset SMA support that treatment with nusinersen has the 
potential to prolong overall and event-free survival. They also support the need for early treatment 
with nusinersen, since shortly after the loading phase was complete, the rate of ventilation among 
nusinersen-treated subjects separated from that of the controls. 
Taken together, these data demonstrate consistently that nusinersen has produced meaningful 
benefits across a broad range of SMA phenotypes. The consistency among the various key clinically 
meaningful endpoints, each of which provide independent measures central to the pathology of SMA, 
support significant efficacy in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic subjects and across infantile-
onset and later-onset SMA. 
The current studies do not provide evidence that the treatment effects persist with indefinite length of 
treatment, neither in infantile nor in later onset SMA.

PAES: In order to evaluate the long term efficacy and safety of Nusinersen in symptomatic 
patients with spinal muscular atrophy, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of the 
Phase 3, open-label extension study (SHINE, CS11).

patients with spinal muscular atrophy, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of the 
Phase 2, open-label study (NURTURE (SM201)). 
Along with the needed data on efficacy and safety to be derived from the above studies, their 
protocols include PK data collections. These are being used to collect the required PK data in order to 
enable the company to make future decisions about whether any dose adjustment, or further 
investigation in to dose adjustment, is required. CSF data are being collected from both these studies 
and will be used in the comprehensive update to the Pop PK model.  
Additionally, the following measures will contribute to the better understanding of the efficacy, safety 
and clinical applicability of the product:

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  safety  data  that  form  the  basis  of  the  marketing  application  for  nusinersen  were  reported  in 
infants and children in controlled studies as well as open-label studies. Subjects were classified as pre-
symptomatic  (exhibiting  no  symptoms  of  SMA)  or  symptomatic  at  the  time  of  enrolment  and  were 
further classified depending on the age at diagnosis (<6 and ≥ 6 months of age). Six different pools of 
subjects (Pools A through F) were created for the integrated safety analysis based on the presence or 
absence of symptoms and time of first symptom onset. While the age of symptom onset and severity 
of  disease  is  influenced  by  SMN2  copy  number,  the  mechanism  of  action  of  nusinersen  is  the  same 
across  all  patients,  regardless  of  the  number  of  gene  copies  or  age  at  onset  of  disease.  Therefore, 
when evaluating the safety of nusinersen, stratification by SMN2 copy number was not performed. 
The presentation of data for the integrated safety analysis (Pools A through F) is shown in the Table 7 
below.

*The safety profile of the unique subjects in CS1 and CS2 from the parent and extension studies were combined. 
In the data being reported, the overall exposure to nusinersen was 246.08 subject-years in 173 
subjects:  
• 
Infantile-Onset SMA: Study CS3B 
o  Study CS3B was stopped prematurely due to the efficacy observed in the nusinersen-
treated group compared to the sham-control group during an interim analysis. Safety 
data are presented with a date of 21 November 2016 for the last patient last visit and 
represent the final data for Study CS3B. . Median time on study was 280.0 and 187.0 
days for the nusinersen-treated and sham-control groups, respectively. The total 
number of subject-years on study was 83.43 (58.04 subject-years in the nusinersen-
treated group and 25.39 subject-years in the sham-control group) [

o  A total of 25 subjects were screened, of whom 20 subjects were enrolled and treated. 
Nineteen subjects (95%) received 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 doses, and 1 subject (5%) had 1 
dose; the median number of doses was 6.0 
• 
For subjects with later-onset SMA, of the 126 subjects who received treatment, 54 
subjects (43%) completed the study (42% of subjects in the nusinersen-treated group 
and 45% of subjects in the sham-control group) and 114 subjects (90%) had 
completed treatment (89% in the nusinersen-treated group and 93% in the sham-
control control group). No subjects discontinued treatment or withdrew from the 
study. As of the data cutoff date, 49 out of 84 subjects (58%) in the nusinersen group 
and 23 out of 42 subjects (55%) in the control group were continuing in the study. 
Time on study ranged from 170 to 470 days (approximately 6 to 16 months), with a 
median of 416 days (approximately 14 months). Total subject-years on study were 
134.06. 
Of the 260 patients who received Spinraza up to a maximum of 4 years, 154 patients received 
treatment for at least 1 year. 
Additionally, approximately 170 subjects are participating in other ongoing blinded studies (CS4, 
SM202 and CS11 [blinded during the loading phase]). 
Only limited data (e.g., SAEs, deaths) from subjects participating in some blinded studies (CS4, CS11, 
and SM202) have been included to protect study integrity as these studies are still ongoing and 
therefore remain blinded. 
Adverse events 
The  safety  of  nusinersen  has  been  analysed  using  integrated  presentations  of  data  from  studies  in 
infants  and  children  with  SMA.  A  total  of  1433  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  in  92  subjects 
(92%)  in  Study  CS3A  and  CS3B  combined,  94  AEs  were  reported  in  13  subjects  (76%)  in  Study 
SM201, and 682 AEs were reported in 56 subjects (100%) in the later-onset SMA studies. 
The commonly reported AEs in infants and children treated with nusinersen in the clinical studies were 
either  consistent  with  events  occurring  in  the  natural  history  of  SMA,  consistent  with  common 
conditions  in  the  general  population,  consistent  with  common  age-appropriate  events,  or  consistent 
with events observed in the context of lumbar puncture. 
Subjects  who  were  pre-symptomatic  for  SMA  had  fewer  AEs  reported  compared  with  symptomatic 
infants, which is consistent with a healthier baseline condition at the time of enrolment. 
Infants Diagnosed with SMA 
A total of 100 subjects with symptomatic infantile-onset SMA were treated with nusinersen in Studies 
CS3B and CS3A. 
In  Study  CS3B,  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  in  96%  of  subjects  who  received  nusinersen 
treatment  and  98%  of  subjects  who  received  sham  (control)  treatment.  A  lower  percentage  of 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 86/117 
  
  
 
 
 
subjects  in  the  nusinersen  group  had  a  severe  or  moderate  event  (nusinersen  vs.  control:  88%  vs. 
95%),  a  severe  event  (56%  vs.  80%),  or  an  SAE  (76%  vs.  95%).  No  SAEs  were  considered  by  the 
Investigator  to  be  related  or  possibly  related  to  the  study  treatment.  A  lower  percentage  of 
nusinersen-treated subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE (16% vs. 39%). All discontinuations, 
in both groups, were due to fatal SAEs. 
The most commonly reported AEs occurred in the system organ classes (SOCs) of infections and 
infestations, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The most commonly reported AEs in 
20% or more of subjects (nusinersen versus control) were respiratory and/or infectious in nature: 
upper respiratory tract infection (nusinersen vs. control: 30% vs. 22%), respiratory distress (26% vs. 
29%), pneumonia (29% 
vs. 17%), respiratory failure (25% vs. 39%), atelectasis (23% vs. 29%), acute respiratory failure 
(14% vs. 24%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (10% vs. 17%), oxygen saturation 
decreased (13% vs. 24%) and cough (11% vs. 20%). Other commonly reported events include 
pyrexia (56% vs. 59%), constipation (35% vs. 22%), vomiting (18% vs. 20%), gastroesophageal 
reflux  disease  (13%  vs.  20%),  and  dysphagia  (11%  vs.  20%).  The  nature  of  these  events  in  the 
nusinersen-treated arm was generally consistent with those reported in the sham-control arm, and in 
line with what is expected for subjects with infantile-onset SMA. Overall, there was no safety concern 
emerging  from  close  monitoring  following  dosing.  There  was  no  notable  difference  in  the  overall 
incidence of AEs between the loading dose and maintenance dose periods. When measured by 90-day 
intervals, the incidence of AEs and SAEs showed a small decrease over time. There was no new type 
of AEs appearing with longer exposure.  The results from the open-label study CS3A were similar. 
Based  on  preclinical  findings  of  hippocampal  vacuoles,  a  medical  review  was  performed  for  AEs 
suggestive of epilepsy, which might indicate hippocampal pathology in human subjects. There was no 
epilepsy  reported.  There  was  1  event  of  seizure  reported  in  an  nusinersen-treated  subject,  in  the 
context of brain injury. 
In Study SM201 (CS5, pre-symptomatic subjects): 
A  total  of  16  out  of  20  subjects  (80%)  experienced  at  least  1  AE,  and  the  most  common  AEs  were 
upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and nasopharyngitis. 
Most  subjects  experienced  AEs  that  are  considered  either  mild  (5  subjects  [25%])  or  moderate  (9 
subjects  [45%])  in  severity,  and  only  2  subjects  (10%)  with  3  events  experienced  severe  AEs;  3 
subjects  (15%)  experienced  AEs  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  the  study 
treatment,  which  were  muscular  weakness  and  weight  bearing  difficulty  in  1  subject;  hyperreflexia 
and tachycardia in 1 subject; and pyrexia, ALT and AST increased with eosinophil count, lymphocyte 
count, and WBC count increased in 1 subject. Five subjects (25%) experienced AEs considered by the 
Investigator  to  be  related  to  the  LP  procedure,  which  were  post  LP  discomfort  and  subdural

extradural  haematoma,  weight  bearing  difficulty,  tachycardia,  and  muscular  weakness  in  1  subject; 
epidural haemorrhage, spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage, hyperreflexia, and tachycardia in 1 subject;

experienced SAEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study. Overall, 
the  events  reported  with  an  incidence  of  more  than  10%  in  both  infantile-onset  SMA  studies  were 
similar in type and frequency. The commonly reported AEs were either generally consistent with those 
expected in a population with infantile-onset SMA, consistent with common conditions occurring in the 
general population, or consistent with age-appropriate events in these studies. 
Subjects with Later Onset SMA 
Fifty-six  subjects  with  later-onset  SMA,  aged  2  to  15  years  at  time  of  first  dose,  were  treated  with 
nusinersen in Studies CS1, CS2, CS10 and CS12. 
Study CS4 
Of the 126 subjects who received treatment, 54 subjects (43%) completed the study (42% of subjects 
in  the  nusinersen-treated  group  and  45%  of  subjects  in  the  sham-control  group)  and  114  subjects 
(90%) had completed treatment (89% in the nusinersen-treated group and 93% in the sham-control 
control group). No subjects discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study. As of the data cutoff 
date,  49  out  of  84  subjects  (58%)  in  the  nusinersen  group  and  23  out  of  42  subjects  (55%)  in  the 
control group were continuing in the  study.  The median number of doses received was 4 (minimum, 
maximum: 3, 4), and 116 subjects (92%) had received 4 doses or underwent sham procedure. Time 
on  study  ranged  from  170  to  470  days  (approximately  6  to  16  months),  with  a  median  of  416  days 
(approximately 14 months). Total subject-years on study were 134.06. 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  in  93%  of  subjects  who  received 
nusinersen  treatment  and  100%  of  subjects  who  received  sham  (control)  treatment.  A  lower 
percentage  of  subjects  in  the  nusinersen  group  had  a  severe  or  moderate  event  (nusinersen  vs. 
control:  42%  vs.  48%),  a  severe  event  (5%  vs.  7%),  or  an  SAE  (14%  vs.  26%).  No  SAEs  were 
considered by the Investigator to be related or possibly related to the study treatment. No subjects in 
either treatment group discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
Events  reported  in  more  than  20%  of  subjects  in  either  arm  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(27%  nusinersen  vs.  38%  sham-control),  nasopharyngitis  (20%  vs.  36%),  cough  (24%  vs  21%), 
pyrexia  (39%  vs  36%),  vomiting  (25%  vs  10%),  back  pain  (25%  vs  0%),  and  headache  (27%  vs 
7%). The majority of the AEs were considered to be either related to SMA disease, common events in 
the  general  population,  or  events  related  to  the  lumbar  puncture  procedure,  consistent  with  the 
observations  in  the  open-label  trials.  Twenty-five  subjects  (30%)  in  the  nusinersen  group  vs.  3 
subjects  (7%)  in  the  sham-control  group  had  a  possibly-related  or  related  AE  in  the  opinion  of  the 
investigator. Fourteen out of the 25 subjects in the nusinersen group with a possibly-related or related 
AE  experienced  an  event  likely  associated  with  the  lumbar  puncture  procedure,  such  as  headache, 
back pain, post lumbar puncture syndrome, vomiting or procedural nausea, all of which were mild or 
moderate  in  severity.  The  AE  of  procedural  nausea  is  the  only  event  in  those  25  subjects  that  was 
considered related to study drug in the opinion of the Investigator. 14% of subjects in the nusinersen 
group vs. 26% of subjects in the sham control group. The most common SAE was pneumonia in both 
groups (2% in the nusinersen group vs. 12% in the sham-control group). 
There were no deaths or TEAEs with a fatal outcome. 
CHMP Assessment report

Overall, the nature of the AEs reported in the later-onset SMA studies were either consistent with what 
is  expected  for  the  Type  II  and  Type  III  SMA  population,  consistent  with  common  conditions  in  the 
general  population,  or  consistent  with  events  observed  in  the  context  of  the  lumbar  puncture 
procedure.  The  subjects  in  these  later-onset  studies  were  older  and  therefore  had  better  verbal 
communication skills than subjects in the infantile-onset studies; thus explaining a higher incidence of 
reported lumbar puncture-related events in comparison to infants  
Analysis of Adverse Events Over Time 
Infants Diagnosed with SMA 
An  analysis  of  AEs  over  time  by  90-day  intervals  and  by  loading  and  maintenance  phase  was 
performed  for  subjects  in  Studies  CS3B  and  CS3A,  both  separately  and  combined;  these  analyses 
were  not  performed  for  Study  SM201  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  who  were  followed  for  a 
relatively short time on study. An analysis of events reported during the 24 and 72 hours post-lumbar 
puncture  procedure  was  performed  for  subjects  in  all  three  studies.  This  analysis  was  specifically 
performed to examine lumbar puncture related complications as most lumbar puncture related events 
occur within a 72-hour timeframe. Certain events commonly seen in the context of a lumbar puncture 
such as headache and back pain could be underreported in infants as compared to children due to the 
difference in verbal communication skills. 
In Study CS3B, the incidence of AEs was generally consistent over time. No new types of events were 
identified with longer drug exposure. In Study CS3A, when assessed at 90-day intervals, the incidence 
of AEs tended to decrease over time. This may reflect subjects in Study CS3A being on study longer 
and experiencing continued improvement. 
In both Study CS3B and Study CS3A, there were no notable differences in the types of AEs reported 
during the loading and maintenance dosing periods. The analysis of events reported during the 24 and 
72  hours  post  lumbar  puncture  procedure  in  Studies  CS3B,  CS3A  and  SM201  revealed  no  safety 
concerns. 
Subjects with Later-Onset SMA 
An analysis of events reported over time by 90-day intervals and by loading and maintenance phase 
was  not  performed  for  subjects  in  the  later-onset  SMA  studies,  as  these  subjects  experienced  long 
gaps in time between studies. An analysis of events reported during the 24 and 72 hours post lumbar 
puncture procedure was performed. No safety concerns emerged from close monitoring following the 
lumbar  puncture  procedure,  and  only  events  expected  in  the  context  of  lumbar  puncture  were 
reported. 
The SmPC guideline requires that specific aspects of the treatment related to the use of the medicinal 
product  or  its  effects  should  be  mentioned  and  that  all  adverse  reactions  (and  only  adverse  drug 
reactions)  be  listed  in  section  4.8.  Since  this  product  is  for  intrathecal  use,  adverse  reactions  linked 
with this route of administration should be communicated as they are an intrinsic part of the use and 
safety  of  the  medicine.  The  fact  that  they  are  linked  to  the  route  of  administration  required  special 
attention  and  discrimination  in  SmPC  and  information  characterising  specific adverse  reactions  which 
may be useful to prevent, assess or manage the occurrence of an adverse reaction in clinical practice 
(including frequency, time of onset and reversibility).

Analysis of Adverse Events by Severity 
In Studies CS3B and CS3A, most events were mild or moderate in severity, and the few severe events 
were  respiratory  in  nature  (e.g.  respiratory  failure  and  respiratory  distress).  The  incidence  of  severe 
events was lower in the nusinersen-treated group (nusinersen vs. control: 56% vs. 80%). Many of the 
most  commonly  reported  events  were  rated  severe  in  intensity:  respiratory  failure  (18%  vs.  37%), 
acute  respiratory  failure  (14%  vs.  22%),  respiratory  distress  (15%  vs.  20%),  pneumonia  (13%  vs. 
12%), and atelectasis (8% vs. 10%). In Study SM201, no severe AEs were reported. 
In subjects with later-onset SMA, most events were mild or moderate in severity, and the only severe 
event reported by more than 1 subject was viral pneumonia in 2 subjects. 
Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Treatment 
Infants Diagnosed with SMA 
In Study CS3B, no AEs were considered by the Investigators to be related to study treatment. Only a 
few  events  were  considered  to  be  possibly  related,  and  the  incidence  of  these  events  was  slightly 
lower in nusinersen-treated subjects versus controls: (11% vs. 15%). These possibly related AEs were 
evaluated on an individual basis and causality to nusinersen was excluded. For medical review, events 
classified  by  the  Investigator  as  “possible”  or  “related”  were  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study 
treatment.  No  AEs  were  considered by  the  Investigators  to  be  related  to  the study  treatment  (Table 
5).  Very  few  events  were  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  the  study  treatment  (nusinersen  vs. 
control: 10 events in 9 subjects vs. 7 events in 6 subjects) [Table 9]. The incidence of AEs thought by 
the  Investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  treatment  was  lower  in  the  nusinersen-treated  group 
(nusinersen vs. control: 11% vs. 15%) 
In Study CS3A, 2 AEs, both mild in severity, were considered by the Investigator as related to study 
treatment.  These  included  a  transient  neutropenia  in  1  subject  and  vomiting  in  1  subject.  Both  of 
these AEs resolved. 
In Study SM201, no AEs were considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment. Three 
subjects  (18%)  experienced  AEs  that  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to 
study  drug.  These  events  included  muscular  weakness  and  weight  bearing  difficulty  in  1  subject, 
hyperreflexia  and  tachycardia  in  1  subject,  and  ALT  and  AST  increased  and  pyrexia,  ALT  and  AST 
increased  with  eosinophil  count,  lymphocyte  count,  and  WBC  count  increased  in  1  subject.    Study 
SM201  was  also  designed  to  be  able  to  capture  a  distinction  in  relatedness  to  the  lumbar  puncture 
procedure.  Five  subjects  (29%)  experienced  AEs  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  the 
lumbar  puncture  procedure.  These  included  post  lumbar  puncture  syndrome  and  spinal  cord 
hematoma  in  1  subject,  epidural  hemorrhage  and  spinal  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  in  1  subject, 
extradural hematoma and weight bearing difficulty in 1 subject, postprocedural swelling in 1 subject, 
and  subdural  hematoma  in  1  subject.  All  of  these  were  associated  with  failed  lumbar  puncture 
attempts (sometimes multiple failed attempts), and resolved via standard of care.  
Subjects with Later-Onset SMA 
In  subjects  with  later-onset  SMA,  7  AEs  in  6  subjects  were  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  study 
treatment. These included headache in 2 subjects, and CSF White Blood Cell (WBC) count increased, 
heart rate increased, palpitations, paresthesia and post lumbar puncture syndrome in 1 subject each.

These  events  appear  to  be  more  likely  related  to  the  LP  procedure.  More  serious  complications 
associated with lumbar puncture such as serious infections (e.g. meningitis), have not been observed 
in the nusinersen clinical studies as of the cut-off date. 
There  is  no  information  provided  by  the  Applicant  on  cognition,  learning  abilities  or  attention  for 
infants / children / adolescents with SMA treated with nusinersen. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
As of the cutoff date for the original submission, a total of 29 deaths were reported in the CS3B study. 
While no deaths were reported in subjects with pre-symptomatic SMA and later-onset SMA, there 
were several deaths reported in subjects with infantile-onset SMA, where death can be considered an 
expected outcome in this severe form of the disease.  In Study CS3B, a total of 29 subjects died 
including 13 subjects in the nusinersen-treated arm and 16 subjects in the sham-control arm. The 
mortality rate in nusinersen-treated subjects was less than that in sham-control subjects (15% versus 
32%). The applicant provided data from the final analysis of CS3B, which supports the efficacy data 
from the interim analysis. As of the cutoff date for the final analysis, 31 subjects (39%) in the 
nusinersen group and 28 subjects (68%) in the control group had died or required permanent 
ventilation. The separation was clear, between the 3 and 6 months, when the loading doses have been 
finished.  
Deaths reported in the infant population were consistent with the typical causes of death in the setting 
of this rapidly progressive and fatal form of SMA, both for nusinersen-treated and sham-control 
subjects. However, the fatality rate for SIS 396443-treated subjects was less than half the fatality rate 
of sham-control subjects (nusinersen vs. control: 16% vs. 39%).  
Of the 16 sham-control subjects, 7 subjects died from respiratory failure, 2 from respiratory distress 
and  1  from  acute  respiratory  failure.  A  further  3  subjects  died  from  cardiorespiratory  arrest,  2  from 
hypoxic condition and a single subject died of unknown causes. 
In  Study  CS3A,  a  total  of  4  subjects  died;  2  subjects  died  due  to  respiratory  failure,  1  due  to 
accidental asphyxia and 1 due to metapneumovirus infection. 
The  causes  of  death  in  both  infantile-onset  SMA  studies  were  mostly  respiratory  in  nature  and  were 
consistent  with  the  causes  of  death  typically  observed  in  infants  with  Type  I  SMA.  None  were 
considered related to study treatment. 
One additional death occurred after the cut-off date for the integrated safety analysis and involved a 3 
year old girl in Study CS3A who developed a mucous plug which led to cardiac arrest and irreversible 
hypoxic ischemic injury; life support was withdrawn. 
Since  the  nature  of  the  event  is  consistent  with  other  events  observed  in  the  context  of  SMA,  the 
overall safety assessment remains unchanged. 
Death in subjects with SMA is not unexpected. Across all deaths reported in subjects in the nusinersen 
clinical development program, none were considered related to treatment and all occurred in subjects 
with the most severe SMA phenotype.

Post-mortem examination was done in a limited number of cases. There is no evidence of hippocampal 
pathology although this is noted as a concern in the non clinical studies; furthermore no case of 
hypoxic injury was related to seizure (reflective of hippocampal lesion).  
Serious Adverse Events 
No SUSARs have been reported during the nusinersen clinical development program. The majority of 
SAEs reported were events expected in the context of SMA disease or events observed in the context 
of lumbar puncture. 
Infants Diagnosed with SMA 
In  Study  CS3B,  61  subjects  (76%)  in  the  ISIS  396643  group  and  39  subjects  (95%)  in  the  control 
group  experienced  at  least  1  SAE.  The  most  common  SAEs  were  respiratory distress  (nusinersen vs. 
control:  26%  vs.  20%),  respiratory  failure  (25%  vs.  39%),  pneumonia  (24%  vs.  12%),  acute 
respiratory failure (14% vs. 22%), atelectasis (18% vs. 10%), pneumonia aspiration (10% vs. 12%), 
rhinovirus infection (9% vs. 5%), pneumonia viral (8% vs. 5%), and cardio-respiratory arrest (6% vs. 
12%). 
In Study CS3A, a total of 16 subjects experienced at least 1 SAE. These included respiratory distress 
(30%),  respiratory  failure  (25%),  acute  respiratory  failure  (20%),  pneumonia  (20%),  rhinovirus 
infection  (20%)  bronchiolitis  (15%),  metapneumovirus  infection  (10%),  apnoea,  (10%)  atelectasis 
(10%, pneumonia aspiration (10%) (10%),pneumonia viral (10%) and viral infection (10%). All other 
SAEs were reported in a single subject each (5%) and included asphyxia, aspiration, hypoventilation, 
hypoxia,  pneumomediastinum,  corona  virus  infection,  enterovirus  infection,  lower  respiratory  virus 
infection  viral,  parainfluenzae  virus  infection,  pneumonia  bacterial,  pneumonia  pseudomonas 
aeruginosa,  respiratory  syncytial  virus  bronchiolitis,  respiratory  tract  infection,  respiratory  tract 
infection  viral,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  bradycardia, 
cardiac arrest, cardiorespiratory arrest, cyanosis, pneumopericardium, failure to thrive, hyponatremia, 
vomiting, synovitis and convulsion. 
In  Study  SM201,  a  total  of  5  subjects  (29%)  reported  an  SAE.  These  SAEs  included  bronchitis, 
pneumonia,  failure  to  thrive,  and  urinary  tract  infection  reported  in  1  subject  each  and  post  lumbar 
puncture syndrome, abdominal distension, and respiratory distress all reported in a single subject. 
The  types  of  SAEs  reported  in  subjects  in  the  infantile-onset  studies  were  consistent  with  events 
reported in the context of Type I SMA. 
Subjects with Later-Onset SMA 
In subjects with later-onset SMA in the open-label studies, 14 SAEs were reported, which included 
respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure, dyspnea, atelectasis, pneumonia, metapneumovirus 
infection, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia viral, 
gastroenteritis, post lumbar puncture syndrome, and drug hypersensitivity (to fentanyl). All SAEs were 
reported in one subject each, with the exception of post lumbar puncture syndrome and pneumonia 
viral which were reported in 2 subjects.  In the controlled study CS4, twelve subjects (14%) in the 
nusinersen group and 11 subjects (26%) in the control group experienced at least 1 SAE. The most 
common SAEs were pneumonia (nusinersen vs. control: 2% vs. 12%), pneumonia viral (2% vs. 0%), 
and respiratory distress (2% vs. 5%). No SAE was reported by more than 2 subjects in the nusinersen 
group. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 92/117 
  
  
 
 
 
The types of SAEs seen in subjects with later-onset SMA were consistent with events reported in the 
context of Type II or Type III SMA. 
Other Serious Adverse Events in Subjects in Other Populations 
Overall, 75 SAEs were reported in 31 subjects in Studies CS4, CS11, and SM202 as of the data cut-off 
date for the original filing. The majority of the SAEs were respiratory in nature. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
In  Studies  CS3B  and  CS3A,  all  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  were  events  with  a  fatal  outcome.  No 
AEs leading to discontinuation have occurred in infants with pre-symptomatic SMA or in subjects with 
later-onset SMA. 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
A  comprehensive  approach  was  undertaken  to  identify  potential  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADR)  for 
nusinersen,  which  took  into  consideration  differences  in  AE  incidence  from  a  randomized,  controlled 
study,  as  well  as  Investigator  relatedness,  lumbar  puncture  procedure  relatedness,  and  a  thorough 
medical review of the events in the context of the natural history of the disease. In addition, medical 
review of AEs from all open-label studies was performed. 
AEs with ≥ 5% higher incidence in nusinersen-treated vs sham-controlled subjects in Study CS3B were 
identified (the 5% higher incidence threshold was chosen based on the 2:1 subject randomization and 
the  size  of  the  study).  Events  reaching  the  threshold  were  assessed  for  risk  factors/confounders  or 
alternative explanations to account for the observed higher incidence. 
In addition, for Study CS3B and the other open-label studies, this assessment was complemented by 
medical review of additional AEs (as listed below) to identify any other potential ADRs: 
• 
• 
• 
Events that may be related to preclinical findings – assessed for plausibility as ADRs 
Events assessed by the Investigator as related or possibly related to study drug 
Events  possibly  related  to  the  lumbar  puncture  procedure  (in  infants  includes  assessment  of 
AEs occurring within 72 hours of drug administration) 
After thorough medical review of AEs was performed by the Sponsor, none were considered related to 
nusinersen,  and  the  majority  of  the  events  were  considered  to  be  related  to  either  SMA  disease, 
common  events  in  the  general  population,  age-appropriate  events,  or  events  related  to  the  lumbar 
puncture procedure. 
Therefore, no ADRs were identified for nusinersen. 
Data presentation in prescribing information (proposed in initial filing): 
No ADRs for nusinersen were identified. However, to adequately provide information to physicians that 
is  useful  in  making  treatment  decisions  and  monitoring  and  advising  patients,  the  prescribing 
information  will  include  a  table  of  common  AEs  occurring  in  at  least  20%  of  nusinersen-treated  vs 
sham-controlled  subjects  even  though  these  events  are  not  considered  drug-related.  Events  with 
≥ 5%  higher  incidence  in  nusinersen-treated  vs  sham-controlled  subjects  or  in  the  text  below  as 
follows:

Table 7 Summary of Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
Occurring in at Least 20% of Patients Treated with nusinersen or Sham in Study 
CS3B. 
In addition to the events indicated in the Table above, the most common AEs reported in study CS3A 
(≥ 20% of nusinersen treated patients, n=20) were nasal congestion (35%), increased upper airways 
secretion  (25%),  chronic  respiratory  failure  (20%),  hypoxia  (20%),  nasopharyngitis  (30%),  otitis

In the integrated analysis of 4 open-label studies (Study CS1, CS2, CS10, and CS12, n=56) in later-
onset  SMA  the  most  common  AEs  reported  in  more  than  20%  of  the  nusinersen  treated  patients 
(regardless  of  causality)  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (48%),  nasopharyngitis  (29%), 
vomiting  (21%),  pyrexia  (29%),  post  lumbar-puncture  syndrome  (41%),  back-pain  (41%),  scoliosis

Safety Areas of Special Interest 
No safety areas of special interest were identified based on consideration of the mechanism of action 
of nusinersen, data from nonclinical studies, therapeutic class effects (e.g. severe thrombocytopenia), 
and underlying conditions in SMA that might be affected by treatment with nusinersen. 
SMA201: Number of Successful and Failed Lumbar Punctures 
Of 20 subjects, the LP procedure was successful in  19 subjects (95%); of those 19 subjects, LP was 
successful  on  the  first  attempt  in  13  subjects  (65%),  after  the  second  attempt  in  4  subjects  (20%), 
after  the  third  attempt  in  1  subject  (5%),  and  after  >3  attempts  in  1  subject  (5%;  Table  20).  Five 
attempts  were  made  for  the  subject  with  whom  the  LP  procedure  was  not  successful  on  the  first 
attempted  LP  day;  LP  was  successful  with  ultrasound  guidance  after  3  attempts  on  the  second 
attempted LP day. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no patterns or trends observed in abnormalities of CSF safety laboratory values or blood 
chemistry,  hematology  or  urinalysis  parameters.  There  were  no  adverse  changes  in  vital  signs,  or 
physical examination findings that were considered related to treatment with nusinersen. 
. A warning regarding a class effect on platelets and renal function has been added to the SmPC. 
Safety in special populations 
The highest age which has been exposed to nusinersen is 19 years old. Therefore all adverse events 
have occurred in patients up to 19YO. 
Intrinsic Factors 
Age Groups – Integrated 
The  age  subgroups  were  <90  (27  subjects)  and  ≥ 90  days  of  age  (90  subjects),  for  a  total  of  117 
subjects treated with nusinersen (Pool D). 
The number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE were 22 subjects (81%) in the 
<90  days  of  age  subgroup  and  83  subjects  (92%)  in  the  ≥ 90  days  of  age  subgroup.  Overall,  the 
incidence  of  AEs  by  SOC  was  higher  in  the  ≥ 90  days  of  age  subgroup  than  the  <90  days  of  age

≥ 10% higher in the <90 days of age subgroup. The overall lower incidence of AEs in the <90 days of 
age  subgroup  is  likely  influenced  by  the  presence  of  the  pre-symptomatic  subjects  who  were 
contributing  to  this  cohort.  At  baseline,  these  subjects  are  healthier  than  subjects  who  are 
symptomatic with infantile-onset SMA. Indeed when pre-symptomatic subjects are removed from the 
<90  days  of  age  cohort,  these  differences  become  less  apparent  between  the  2  age  groups.  Some 
respiratory  infections  became  more  common  in  the  <90  days  of  age  cohort,  consistent  with  young 
symptomatic subjects having a more severe disease. 
The age subgroups included children <6 years of age (28 subjects) and children ≥ 6 years of age (28 
subjects),  for  a  total  of  56  subjects  treated  with  nusinersen  (Pool  E).  The  number  (percentage)  of 
subjects who experienced at least 1 AE were 28 subjects (100%) in the <6 years of age subgroup and 
28 subjects (100%) in the ≥ 6 years of age subgroup. The AE incidence was generally similar between 
the  2  age  subgroups  .  The  most common  SOCs  were  similar  between  the  <6  years  of  age  subgroup 
and  the ≥ 6  years of  age subgroup,  e.g.,  infections and  infestations  (82%  versus  75%,  respectively) 
and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (75%  versus  71%,  respectively).  However,  LP-
related  events  were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  older  age  group  (e.g.,  post  lumbar  puncture 
syndrome 21% in the <6 years of age subgroup versus 61% in the ≥ 6 years of age subgroup). 
Of note very little data are available in subjects 18 years of age and above; also scoliosis, hypoxemia 
or low or high SMN2 copy number were exclusion criteria for study CS3B. 
Sex 
Of  the  117  infants,  60  were  male  and  57  were  female.  There  was  no  difference  in  AE  incidence 
between the subgroups, and the most common SOCs were the same, e.g., infections and infestations 
and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders, consistent with the underlying SMA disease. 
Of  the  56  later  onset  subjects,  26  were  male  and  30  were  female.  There  was  no  difference  in  AE 
incidence  between  the  subgroups,  and  the  most  common  SOCs  were  the  same,  e.g.,  infections  and 
infestations and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. 
Race 
Of  the  113  infant  subjects  who  reported  race,  93  were  White  and  20  were  non-White.  There  was  no 
difference in AE incidence between the subgroups, and the most common SOCs were the same, e.g., 
infections  and  infestations;  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders;  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders. 
The  overall  incidence  of  later-onset  subjects  with  at  least  1  AE  was  the  same  between  the  2  racial 
subgroups  (100%).  The  non-White  subgroup  had  relatively  few  subjects  (n  =  7)  compared  with  the 
White subgroup (n = 49), thereby limiting meaningful comparisons between the 2 subgroups. 
Body Weight 
Of the 117 infants, 29, 28, 28, and 32 subjects were in the weight quartile subgroups of <5.42, 5.42 
to  <6.31,  6.31  to  <7,  and  ≥ 7  kg,  respectively.  The  overall  incidence  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  AE 
was the same between the 4 weight quartile subgroups. The number of subjects experiencing specific 
events  within  these  weight  quartile  subgroups  was  very  small.  The  most  common  SOCs  (incidence 
≥ 10%)  for  all  4  subgroups  were  infections  and  infestations;  gastrointestinal  disorders;  general 
CHMP Assessment report

disorders  and  administrative  site  conditions;  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders. 
Overall, body weight appeared to have no impact on the incidence of AEs. 
Of the 56 later onset subjects, 14 subjects each were in the weight quartile subgroups of <13.4, 13.4 
to <19.1, 19.1 to <32.8, and ≥ 32.8 kg. The overall incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was the 
same  between  the  4  weight  quartile  subgroups  (100%).  The  most  common  SOCs  (incidence  ≥ 10%) 
for all 4 subgroups were infections and infestations; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; 
injury, poisoning, and procedural complications; general disorders and administrative site conditions; 
nervous system disorders; gastrointestinal disorders; respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; 
and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
Subjects With Hepatic Insufficiency or Severe Renal Failure 
Patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency  or  severe  renal  impairment  were  not  studied  in  the  nusinersen 
clinical  development  program.  There  has  been  no  literature  published  indicating  that  infants  and 
children  with  SMA  are  prone  to  hepatic  disease  or  renal  failure.  A  small  study  of  riluzole  in  subjects 
with SMA reported that there was no evidence of liver or renal failure during the study. There were no 
adverse  events  of  kidney  failure  or  liver  failure  reported  in  the  nusinersen  clinical  program.  No 
clinically significant changes in kidney laboratory parameters were observed in the nusinersen clinical 
studies. While some subjects in the nusinersen clinical studies had increases in liver function tests at 
some timepoint during their participation in the studies, no sustained increases were observed despite 
continuous drug exposure, making these changes not likely to be due to nusinersen. Given the known 
PK  of  nusinersen  and  the  2’-MOE  ASO  class,  the  natural  history  of  the  target  population,  and  the 
results of the clinical and nonclinical studies to date, hepatic and renal effects are not anticipated and 
specific hepatic or renal impairment studies were not conducted. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The  geographic  regions  included  North  America,  Europe,  and  Asia-Pacific.  Subjects  with  later-onset 
SMA included in the integrated analysis were enrolled at sites in North America. In total, 126 subjects 
were enrolled in North America, 33 in Europe, and 14 in Asia-Pacific (Pool F). 
For  all  subjects  treated  with  nusinersen  (Pool  F),  the  SOC  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorder 
had  a  higher  incidence  in  North  America  (54  subjects  [43%])  than  in  Europe  (3  subjects  [9%]),  or 
Asia-Pacific  (1  subject  [7%]).  The  PTs  of  rash  (13  subjects  [10%]),  dermatitis  diaper  (12  subjects 
[10%]), and dermatitis contact (6 subjects [5%]) in North America appear to be the difference. Only 2 
subjects from Europe and Asia-Pacific reported rash or dermatitis diaper.  
Overall, these data are not suggestive of clinically meaningful differences in AE incidences across the 
geographic regions. 
Immunological events 
The  immunogenic  response  to  nusinersen  (ADA)  in  plasma  was  determined  in  subjects  from  all  7 
clinical studies in the original filing. 
All  clinical immunogenicity  samples  evaluated  in  Studies  CS1,  CS2,  CS10,  and  SM201  were  negative 
with  respect  to  presence  of  ADA.  A  low  incidence  of  ADA  response  was  observed  in  Studies  CS12, 
CS3A,  and  CS3B  with  2  out  of  47  subjects  (4.3%)  and  1  out  of  20  (5%),  and  6  out  of  128  (5.1%), 
respectively, being classified as ADA positive. One subject from Study CS3B had ADA positive samples 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 97/117 
  
  
 
on  predose  Day  1,  and  two  were  from  the  sham  treatment  arm,  thus  not  considered  related  to 
nusinersen as the subjects had not been exposed to nusinersen at the time of sampling. Three of the 
4  ADA-positive  subjects  were  considered  to  have  a  transient  response  (1  positive  sample,  with  all 
samples  before  and  after  being  negative),  and  1  subject  in  Study  CS12  was  considered  to  have  a 
persistent  response,  based  on  4  samples  evaluated  from  predose  to  Day  351  of  treatment.  The 
reported  titer  values  (without  including  the  50x  minimum  required  dilution)  for  the  4  ADA-positive 
subjects were very low ranging from 1 to 16. 
ADA-positive  plasma  samples  seemed  to  have  a  sporadic  and  inconsistent  effect  on  plasma 
concentrations, but showed no effect on CSF concentrations compared with the ADA-negative samples 
at  the  same  time  and  dose  level.  ADA-positive  plasma  samples  seemed  to  have  a  sporadic  and 
inconsistent  effect  on  plasma  concentrations,  but  showed  no  effect  on  CSF  concentrations  compared 
with the ADA-negative samples at the same time and dose level. 
Electrocardiograms:  
No thorough QT/QTc study was performed and only ECG data from the clinical development program 
are available.  
In the final analysis of Study CS3B, there were 2 subjects in the nusinersen-treated group who had a 
QTc  value  above  500  msec  and  a  change  from  baseline  of  >60 msec,  (1.6%)  and  neither  subject 
reported any cardiovascular events during the study.  Both subjects had a QTc >450 msec on ECG on 
only  one  occasion.  In  Study  CS4,  there  was  one  subject  with  a  single  QTc  value  above  500  msec.  
There  were  no  subjects  who  had  a  QTc  value  above  500  msec  and  a  change  from  baseline  of  >60 
msec  in  Study  CS4.  In  addition,  there  were  no  reports  of  torsade  de  pointes  or  sudden  death  in 
Studies  CS3B  or  CS4,  and  in  both  studies,  fewer  cardiac  disorders  were  reported  in  the  nusinersen-
treated  group  (nusinersen  versus  control:  23%  versus  32%  in  Study  CS3B  and  5%  versus  7%  in 
Study CS4). These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions are not expected with nusinersen. Nusinersen is metabolized via nucleases and 
not  by  the  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  system.  In  vitro  studies  indicated  that  nusinersen  is  not  an 
inducer or inhibitor of CYP450 mediated metabolism and indicated that the likelihood for interactions 
with  nusinersen  due  to  competition  for  plasma  protein  binding,  or  competition  with  or  inhibition  of 
transporters is low. 
No  clinical  studies  of  interactions  of  nusinersen  with  other  medicines  have  been  performed.  Most 
concomitant medications in the clinical studies were used to treat typical complications of SMA or were 
used as sedation during the LP procedure. There was no noticeable potentiation of other common side 
effects to concomitant medication. There were also no AEs observed suggestive of any potential drug-
drug interaction with nusinersen. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
In toxicity studies in animals, no effects on reproductive organs, male or female fertility, or embryo-
fetal  development  were  observed.  There  are  no  data  from  clinical  studies  on  the  use  of  nusinersen 
during pregnancy or during lactation in humans. 
Overdose 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 98/117 
  
  
 
No overdose was reported across the clinical studies of nusinersen, and the Sponsor has no knowledge 
of  the  occurrence  of  an  overdose  of  nusinersen  in  humans.  No  AEs  that  might  point  towards  an 
accidental overdose have been reported. 
One  potential  type  of  overdose  would  be  an  acute  type  in  which  significantly  more  nusinersen  than 
intended  is  mistakenly  administered.  This  would  lead  to  a  higher  concentration  of  nusinersen  in  CSF 
(both maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration time curve) than planned. 
Based  on  the  juvenile  monkey  toxicity  studies  following  IT  bolus  administration  of  doses  ≥ 3  mg  per 
dose,  which  were  not  designed  to  study  overdose,  acute  transient  lower  limb  reflex  changes  during 
the immediate period after dosing are a possible outcome of an overdose. Clinical signs and symptoms 
should  be  monitored  and  appropriate  supportive  care  and  necessary  countermeasures  should  be 
undertaken if clinical evidence suggests this has occurred. 
Another  potential  type  of  overdose  would  be  more  frequent  administration  of  nusinersen  than 
recommended. This was not observed in the clinical studies of nusinersen. 
There  is  no  known  intervention  to  reverse  an  overdose  of  nusinersen  if  it  were  to  occur.  However, 
overdose of nusinersen is very unlikely as the drug will be prepared and administered by a healthcare 
professional in a medical facility. Dosing instructions and frequency of dosing will be clearly stated in 
the  prescriber  information.  Furthermore,  the  pharmacological  action  of  nusinersen  is  restoration  of 
full-length  SMN  protein  via  modifying  splicing,  which  is  a  native  occurring  protein,  without  known 
deleterious effects. 
Drug Abuse 
Because of the different targeted mechanism of action, no potential for drug abuse is anticipated, and 
no  formal  studies  were  conducted  to  examine  drug  abuse.  Nusinersen,  an  ASO,  does  not  cross  the 
blood-brain-barrier; thus there is no possibility of drug abuse potentially related to accidental IV or SC 
dose  administration.  Based  on  its  specificity  of  binding  to  mRNA  to  modulate  splicing  of  the  SMN2 
gene, nusinersen is not likely to bind to receptors known to be involved in drug abuse. In repeat-dose 
toxicology  studies  in  monkeys,  neurobehavioral  assessments  were  within  normal  limits,  consistent 
with the lack of abuse potential. In clinical studies, AEs typical of drug abuse, such as mood elevation 
or hallucinations, were not observed. Thus, nusinersen has a low potential for abuse and should not be 
considered a controlled substance. Nusinersen has no psychoactive properties and produces no mood 
elevating side effects, thereby limiting the potential for abuse or misuse. 
Medical review of relevant AEs terms was performed to identify AEs potentially related to drug abuse. 
This  review  demonstrated  that  the  safety  profile  of  nusinersen  did  not  include  AEs  typical  of  drug 
abuse, such as mood elevation or hallucination. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No  studies  were  designed  to  assess  the  potential  for  nusinersen  to  produce  withdrawal  or  rebound 
effects.  Due  to the  life  threatening  nature  of infantile  onset  SMA,  infants  were  dosed  throughout  the 
studies, and no gaps in dosing were observed. One infant who was voluntarily withdrawn from Study 
CS3A appeared to be stable and showed no signs of withdrawal or rebound as per Investigator follow 
up.  However,  it  is  expected  that  after  discontinuation  of  nusinersen,  the  natural  progression  of  SMA 
ultimately would occur. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 99/117 
  
  
 
In the later-onset SMA studies, there were gaps between the studies that enrolled children; e.g., the 
gap  between  the  last  dose  in  Study  CS1  and  the  first  dose  in  Study  CS10  ranged  from  206  to  399 
days. No withdrawal or acute rebound was observed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse  Events  Leading  to  Study  Treatment  Discontinuation  in  Infants  and  later  onset 
Diagnosed With SMA 
In Study CS3B and Study CS3A, all events leading to treatment discontinuation were a result of death 
that  occurred  before  the  next  scheduled  dose  of  nusinersen  (Interim  CSR  CS3A.    No  event  led  to 
treatment discontinuation in Study SM201. 
No AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation have been reported as of the data cut-off date. No 
AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation have been reported in Studies CS4, SM202, and CS11 
of the safety data cut-off date. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  current  marketing  application  is  intended  to  support  the  use  of  nusinersen  for  the  treatment  of 
SMA. SMA is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the most common genetic cause of infant 
mortality and morbidity. There is no treatment for SMA currently available. SMA is an orphan disease. 
In the clinical studies used as the basis for the safety evaluation, nusinersen has been administered to 
173 infants and children with SMA, encompassing different clinical phenotypes of disease. 
This includes infants with pre-symptomatic disease and infants and children with symptomatic disease 
(infantile-onset and later-onset SMA), which reflects clinical Types I, II and III SMA. Safety data from 
these  cohorts  were  included  in  an  integrated  safety  assessment,  which  also  includes  a  direct 
comparison of nusinersen-treated subjects with sham-controlled subjects from a blinded, randomized, 
controlled  clinical  study  of  infantile-onset  SMA.  An  additional  170  infants  and  children  with  SMA  are 
participating in ongoing, blinded clinical studies of nusinersen, and aggregate SAE listings from these 
subjects  were  also  provided.  The  clinical  development  program  provides  long-term  exposure  to 
nusinersen in infants and children, with 154 subjects having been on study for ≥ 360 days. The overall 
nusinersen exposure across the different clinical studies allows for an adequate assessment of safety 
in the context of this disease. 
Nusinersen is a 2’MOE ASO delivered by the IT route. Other ASOs delivered by the SC or IV route that 
are  on  the  market  or  in  late-phase  development  are  administered  at  higher  doses  and  frequencies, 
thus  leading to  higher  systemic exposures  and  associated  toxicities.  To date, there  is  no  evidence  in 
the  nusinersen  nonclinical  and  clinical  safety  data  to  suggest  a  signal  for  these  toxicities  that  were 
reported in other SC and IV ASOs (e.g. severe thrombocytopenia, renal disorders). Notwithstanding, a 
class effect warning will be present in the SmPC, as this risk cannot be absolutely excluded. 
Across  the  clinical  development  program,  common  adverse  events  in  symptomatic  subjects  with 
infantile-onset SMA who received nusinersen were consistent with either events commonly observed in 
the  context  of  SMA  disease,  with  common  events  observed  in  the  general  population,  with  common 
age-appropriate  events,  or  with  events  commonly  observed  in  the  context  of  lumbar  puncture.  In 
symptomatic  infants  and  children  with  SMA,  across  different  dosing  regimens,  the  most  common 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 100/117 
  
  
 
 
adverse events reported were respiratory in nature, within the SOCs of infections and infestations and 
respiratory  disorders,  and  all  reported  events  were  consistent  with  underlying  SMA  disease. 
Nevertheless,  there  may  be  a  slight  higher  frequency  of  infections,  higher  than  would  be  expected 
with  the  motor  improvement  that  has  been  observed.  Lumbar  puncture-related  events,  such  as 
headache  and  post  lumbar  puncture  syndrome,  were  reported  more  commonly  in  children  than  in 
infants in the nusinersen clinical studies, and this most likely reflects the higher verbal communication 
skills  present  in  children  appropriate  for  their  age.  To  assess  for  the  presence  of  possible  LP-related 
events in infants who are not able to verbally communicate, an analysis of AEs reported in the 24- and 
72-hour periods after dosing was performed. This analysis showed an increase in reports of vomiting 
(a  known  complication  of  the  LP  procedure)  in  the  72-hour  period  post  LP  in  nusinersen-treated 
subjects  than  in  the  sham-controlled  subjects;  yet,  vomiting  overall  is  a  common  adverse  event 
reported in  both  groups throughout  the  clinical  studies.  No  serious  infectious  complications  of  the  LP 
procedure,  such  as  meningitis,  although  some  intrathecal  haemorrhages  have  been  described  during 
the clinical studies of nusinersen. 
The  Applicant  provided  detailed  information  on  the  different  schedules  and  doses  for  each  patient 
across studies, to facilitate assessment on the frequency, severity and time to occurrence of adverse 
events. 
No patient was withdrawn from the study due to failure of administration or to LP related adverse 
events. With the number of LPs performed in each patient, it is not unlikely that a significant number 
of patients will develop an adverse event related to LP. The Applicant also provided data regarding the 
number of LP related events in the scoliosis group as compared to the non scoliotic, particularly in 
SMAII and III, after request from CHMP. 
The applicant has provided a justification for the occurrence of haemorrhagic events at LP, which were 
related to several attempts in study SM201, and not in any other. The applicant proposes to perform 
LPs under imaging guidance. Also, the increased frequency of PLPS in nusinersen was justified with 
the fact that events accumulate as patients survive and keep being treated. Moreover, the applicant 
has compared the frequency of PLPS in nusinersen patients to the ones treated with repeated LPs for 
chemotherapy administration, and the frequency of events is overlapping. Considering that 
administration of nusinersen and chemotherapy do require drainage of an equivalent amount of CSF to 
prevent increased CSF pressure, and that sometimes imbalance in draining and injection does occur, 
this approach can be acceptable. 
There was no difference on the rate of hospitalisation between nusinersen and the control arm in 
study CS3B. To the question “Has any AE in nusinersen arm been more likely to require hospital 
admission than AEs in the control arm?”, the applicant has justified the more frequent admissions to 
hospital on the nusinersen group with the fact that this group had a slightly poorer condition at 
baseline than the control group. The duration of stay at the hospital is different though, with 8.9 days 
for nusinersen treated vs 13.9 in the control group. There is also no significant difference between the 
type of adverse events or severity between groups. 
There  were  no  deaths  reported  in  the  pre-symptomatic  infants  and  in  the  later-onset  SMA  subjects. 
Deaths  were  reported  in  the  infantile-onset  SMA  studies,  both  for  nusinersen-treated  and  sham-
controlled  subjects.  The  fatality  rate  of  the  nusinersen-treated  subjects  was  half  that  of  the  sham-
controlled  subjects.  Causes  of  death  in  both  cohorts  were  consistent  with  causes  of  death  typically 
observed in the setting of this rapidly progressive and fatal form of infantile-onset SMA.

A detailed review was performed to identify adverse drug reactions. This included a comparison of AE 
incidence  rates  between  nusinersen-treated  and  sham-controlled  subjects  in  Study  CS3B.  This  was 
complemented by a medical review of additional AEs in Study CS3B and the other open-label studies, 
including  a  review  of  events  that  were  assessed  as related  or  possibly  related  by  the  Investigator,  a 
review  of  plausible  events  based  on  preclinical  data,  and  a  review  of  possible  LP-related  events.  No 
adverse  drug  reactions  were  identified.  In  addition,  no  new  types  of  events  were  identified  that 
occurred  with  longer  exposure  to  nusinersen  or  with  the  addition  of  data  from  a  randomised  clinical 
trial in later-onset patients.. 
Infants who were treated with nusinersen before presenting with symptoms of SMA had fewer AEs and 
SAEs  (13  subjects  [76%]  and  5  subjects  [29%],  respectively)  compared  with  infants  who  already 
were  symptomatic  at  the  time  of  SMA  diagnosis  (92  subjects  [92%]  and  72  subjects  [72%], 
respectively). This most likely reflects a healthier baseline condition in the pre-symptomatic infants at 
the time of enrollment in the study, and this appears to be maintained throughout their participation 
in the study, with the unprecedented development of normal motor milestones. 
The applicant justified the more frequent respiratory infections on nusinersen with the fact that 
nusinersen treated subjects were in worse clinical condition at baseline, and more commonly had 
baseline risk factors such as prior history of pneumonia, paradoxical breathing at baseline, and 
swallowing and feeding difficulties, as noted in their medical histories. Also, the duration of 
observation time in the trial was twice as long for the nusinersen group compared with the sham-
control group (37.7 versus 17.9 years) making it more likely to pick an infection as AE. Finally in study 
CS4 respiratory infections were less observed in the nusinersen treated than in the control group. 
Lastly,  review  of  the  available  laboratory  data  for  nusinersen  demonstrated  no  abnormal  pattern  or 
trend  in  hematology  or  clinical  chemistry  data.  No  adverse  pattern  or  trend  was  observed  in  vital 
signs, ECGs or on physical examinations. Subjects who received ISIS 398443 showed a gain in motor 
milestones, and an improvement in their neurological exams. 
The applicant submitted an update of the various studies that were ongoing at the time of the original 
submission.  
Of note patients in study CS4 received less doses than in studies CS3B and SM201. 
The main adverse events related to respiratory function and infections, which is consistent with the 
nature of events observed in the context of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The main adverse reactions are 
complications of the lumbar puncture and such complications should be clearly addressed in the 
SmPC.  
In Study SM201 (pre-symptomatic patients) 14 of the 20 patients experienced a shift to high in 
eosinophil count, 12 subjects experienced a shift that was mild (500 to 1500 eosinophils/μL); shifts 
>1500 eosinophils/μL were single events in 2 subjects. Seven of the 14 subjects recovered. Increases 
in Creatinine kinase were mainly transient and associated with confounders. There was no signal with 
regards to shifts to high from baseline for eosinophil values in studies CS3B (nusinersen: 26% vs. 
Control 40%) and CS4 (7/84 and 6/42 respectively).  
In study CS3B a higher percentage of nusinersen subjects experienced nervous system disorders 
(11% vs. 5%). No one event contributed to the higher incidence. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017

No case of vasculitis or necrosis was reported in studies SM201 or CS4. Suspected vasculitis was 
reported in one subject (2 events) receiving nusinersen in Study CS3B but alternative diagnosis was 
provided, and the patient continued to be exposed to ISIS396443.  No relationship to the treatment 
was noted. 
In general no patient discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study as a result of an AE. 
The main issue relates to post LP symptoms and no clear frequency has been given by the applicant 
across the clinical development of ISIS396443. Temporal association was clearly seen as soon as 6 
hour after the procedure and were still reported after 7 days in Study CS4.  
Changes to the SmPC have been implemented, such as the abovementioned warning regarding class 
effect  with other  ASO  and  phosphorothioate linkers regarding potential  effect on  kidney  function  and 
platelet  count/coagulation.  A  warning  was  also  added  in  section  4.4  regarding  the  need  to  check 
platelet count/coagulation prior to LP in case of risk factors such as symptomatic bleeding or serious 
infection and for renal function if clinically indicated.  
Anti-Drug-Antibodies were found in 7 of the 148 patients who had negative baseline values; this is 
reflected in the SmPC and the wording is adequate. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  nusinersen  was  characterized  in  subjects  with  infantile-onset  SMA  in  a 
randomized controlled study and an open-label study; pre-symptomatic infants with SMA in an open-
label study, and children with later-onset SMA in a randomized study and open-label studies. Review 
of  the  available  data  demonstrated  no  safety  concerns  due  to  nusinersen  exposure.  The  majority  of 
AEs  and  SAEs  reported  in  subjects  exposed  to  nusinersen  were  consistent  with  the  nature  and 
frequency  of  events  typically  occurring  in  the  context  of  SMA.  Pre-symptomatic  infants  treated  with 
nusinersen experienced fewer adverse events compared with symptomatic infants which is most likely 
due to their healthier baseline condition, which they maintained throughout participation in the study. 
In  addition,  the  fatality  rate  in  nusinersen-treated  subjects  with  infantile-onset  SMA  was  about  half 
that of sham-controlled subjects.   
nusinersen  has  demonstrated  a  favourable  safety  and  efficacy  pattern  in  the  treatment  of  infantile-
onset SMA from a randomized controlled clinical study, Study CS3B. This was supported by favourable 
safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the  interim  analysis  of  a  randomized  controlled  clinical  study,  CS4  in 
later-onset subjects, open-label studies in pre-symptomatic subjects, and subjects with infantile-onset 
and  later-onset  SMA,  where  the  attainment  of  motor  milestones  in  subjects  receiving  treatment 
differed from that seen in the natural history of SMA. 
Based  on  the  totality  of  the  data,  it  can  be  agreed that  nusinersen has  a  positive benefit/risk  profile 
for treating SMA. Long-term safety data will be obtained from the planned and ongoing studies.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
In  order  to  support  the  claim  that  ISIS  396443/Nusinersen  is  a  new  active  substance  the  applicant 
states  to  have  performed  a  search  on  the  available  chemical  literature,  patent  databases,  and 
databases  such  as  SciFinder  (Chemical  Abstracts).  No  approved  drug  substance  in  the  EU  matching 
the chemical structure of ISIS 396443/Nusinersen were found. 
The  applicant  also  compared 
the  molecular  structure  and 
full-length  sequence  of  ISIS 
396443/Nusinersen with that of two other oligonucleotides that have been authorised previously in the 
EU,  fomiversen  and  pegaptanib.  In  neither  case  a  structural  similarity  was  found  with  ISIS 
396443/Nusinersen.  It  is  thus  acceptable  that  ISIS  396443/Nusinersen  does  not  contain  an  active 
principal molecular features and thus a therapeutic moiety also found in other drug substance already 
authorised in the EU. Facing this, the claim of NAS for ISIS 396443/Nusinersen is acceptable. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling (outer carton and immediate label) as per Art.63.1 
of Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the 
immediate label, but unacceptable for the outer carton by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group accepted to have the immediate label in English only based on the estimates of the 
prevalence of the disease, and the low forecast of production expected. However, the QRD Group 
requested the applicant to explore the possibility of multilingual outer cartons. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group.

2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spinraza (nusinersen) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance (NAS). 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Nusinersen  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  SMA.  SMA  is  an  autosomal  recessive  neuromuscular 
disease  characterized  by  degeneration  of  the  motor  neurons  in  the  anterior  horn  of  the  spinal  cord, 
resulting in atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk. 
SMA diagnosis is suspected when a patient presents with flaccid muscle weakness. Genetic diagnosis 
is the most common form of diagnosis, which allows for premorbid diagnosis in siblings where one 
previously affected member has been identified. 
SMA is a serious, debilitating, and life-threatening disease. With a global incidence of 8.5 to 10.3 per 
100,000 live births, it is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, and a major cause of 
childhood morbidity due to weakness. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
SMA  is  a  progressively  disabling  and  fatal  disease  that  has  a  devastating  effect  upon  patients,  their 
families and caregivers. There is currently no available therapy, and patients are limited to supportive 
therapy which can include respiratory, nutritional and orthopaedic support; none of which can stop or 
even slow disease progression. 
The aim of the therapy with Nusinersen is to allow for the production of a functional SMN protein, thus 
preventing  degeneration  of  spinal  motor  neurons  and  the  consequent  muscle  weakness.  This  could 
theoretically  allow  for  the  achievement  of  normal  development  milestones  in  children  who  have  not 
developed clinical signs, and prevent worsening and possibly restore some function in already disabled 
children. 
3.1.3.  Main and supportive clinical studies 
Study  CS3B  is  a  completed  Phase  3,  multicentre,  randomized,  double-Blind,  sham-procedure 
controlled  study  to  assess  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  Spinraza  in  121  patients  with  infantile-
onset SMA ≤ 7 months of age. 
Study  CS4  is  an  ongoing  Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  sham-procedure  controlled  study  to 
assess the clinical efficacy and safety of Spinraza in 126 patients with later-onset SMA and a median 
age at screening of 3 years. 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 109/117 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The  development  plan  comprised  several  additional,  supportive  studies  in  symptomatic  and  pre-
symptomatic SMA patients.  
Study CS3A is an ongoing, Phase 2, open-label study in 20 patients with infantile-onset SMA.  
Study CS1 was a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation (1-9 mg) study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of a single dose of Spinraza in subjects with later-onset SMA who were 2 to 
14 years of age and who were medically stable.  
Study CS10 was an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single dose of 
Spinraza (6 or 9 mg) administered IT by LP in subjects with SMA who previously participated in CS1. 
Of the 28 eligible subjects from CS1, 18 enrolled in CS10. 
Study CS2 was a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of Spinraza in 2- to 15-year-old subjects with later-onset SMA.  
Study CS12 is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of 
repeated doses of Spinraza 12 mg providing 3 year-long treatment data in subjects with SMA who 
previously participated in Study CS2 or Study CS10. 
Finally, study SM201 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, multicentre, single-arm study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Spinraza in pre-symptomatic SMA. The study is 
being conducted in subjects who were ≤6 weeks of age at the time of enrolment with genetic 
documentation of 5q SMA, 2 or 3 copies of the SMN2 gene, CMAP ≥1 mV, and the absence of signs or 
symptoms of SMA.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal study CS3B in infantile-onset patients, a statistically significantly greater percentage of 
subjects achieved the pre-defined motor milestone response in the Spinraza group (51%), one of the 
primary endpoints, compared to the control group (0%; p<0.0001).  
In  addition,  time  to  death  or  permanent  ventilation,  the  other  primary  endpoint,  was  statistically 
significantly  prolonged  in  subjects  treated  with  Spinraza  (HR=0.53  [95%CI:  0.32-0.89];  p=0.0046) 
compared to controls. This was even more prolonged in the subjects treated with Spinraza who were 
below  the  median  for  disease  duration  at  baseline  (HR=0.21  [95%CI:  0.08-0.53];  p=0.0003), 
suggesting that early treatment with Spinraza may confer a strong benefit for event-free survival. 
A  statistically  significantly  greater  percentage  of  subjects  achieved  a  CHOP  INTEND  response  in  the 
Spinraza group (71%) compared to the control group (3%; p<0.0001). Several of the infants treated 
with  Spinraza  had  improvements  of  10  points  or  more  on  the  CHOP  INTEND  total  score.  Sixteen 
(22%)  achieved  full  head  control,  six  (8%)  achieved  independent  sitting  and  one  achieved  standing 
with support. With the exception of one subject, all subjects in the control group showed no change or 
worsened. 
These results are supported by the ongoing study CS3A, where patients with infantile-onset SMA who 
have received Spinraza for over 2 years achieved clinically meaningful gains in motor milestones, 
prolonged overall and event-free survival, and improved motor function and motor neuronal health 
inconsistent with the natural history.  
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 110/117 
  
  
 
In the interim analysis conducted in the ongoing randomized, sham-procedure controlled, double-blind 
CS4 study with later-onset SMA, a statistically significant change from baseline in HFMSE score at 15 
months, the primary endpoint, was observed in the Spinraza  group (+4.0 [95% CI: 2.9-5.1]) 
compared to the sham control group (-1.9 [95% CI: -3.8-0.0)]; p=0.0000002). An improvement was 
also observed in upper limb functional ability.  
In the pre-symptomatic setting, the results available from the ongoing Phase 2, open-label, 
multicentre, single-arm Study SM201 indicate that the development and achievement of motor 
milestones for most subjects has been more consistent with normal development than with the natural 
history of Type I SMA. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While multiple phenotypes of the disease have been comprehensively studied in the development 
programme, patients with very severe, inborn symptoms (previously categorized as Type 0), and 
patients with a mild, adult onset course (previously categorized as type IV SMA) were not included in 
it.  
Another limitation of the current data set resides in the lack of long term data. Therefore, it is not 
known whether the effect size could change as the disease progresses and patients grow up/grow 
older.  
The development has limitations in terms of the most appropriate dose to be used for the different 
patients, both according to their disease severity and according to their changed disease progression. 
As it is expected that this drug may increase the survival of a significant part of the SMA population, 
these patients will reach milestones in their physical development that may necessitate a dose 
adjustment according to their increased body height or other relevant parameters.  Also, it has not 
been significantly ascertained that the proposed therapeutic dose is the optimal one in terms of 
potential benefit to be gained, and that a higher dose cannot bring additional benefits. The imposed 
post-authorisation measures are aimed, among other things, at gathering sufficient data to enable 
future decisions about the necessity of dose adjustment.  
Lastly, there is an uncertainty related to the individual decision to be made to treat each SMA patient 
taking into account their symptoms’ severity and duration, individual disease progression and the 
expected benefit to be derived from the drug.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment of Spinraza was based on data from two Phase 3 clinical studies in infants 
(CS3B) and children (CS4) with SMA, together with open-label studies including pre-symptomatic 
infants genetically diagnosed with SMA and infants and children with SMA. Of the 260 patients who 
received Spinraza up to a maximum of 4 years, 154 patients received treatment for at least 1 year. 
Review  of  the  available  data  demonstrated  no  specific  safety  concerns  that  can  be  attributed  to 
nusinersen exposure. The majority of AEs and SAEs reported in subjects exposed to nusinersen were 
consistent  with  the  nature  and  frequency  of  events  typically  occurring  in  the  context  of  SMA.  Pre-
symptomatic  infants  treated  with  nusinersen  experienced  fewer  adverse  events  compared  with 
symptomatic  infants  which  is  most  likely  due  to  their  healthier  baseline  condition,  which  they 
CHMP Assessment report  
EMA/289068/2017 
Page 111/117 
  
  
 
maintained  throughout  participation  in  the  study.  In  addition,  the  fatality  rate  in  nusinersen-treated 
subjects with infantile-onset SMA was about half that of sham-controlled subjects. 
Nusinersen  has  demonstrated  a  favourable  safety  pattern  in  the  treatment  of  SMA  judging  from  the 
available data from the randomized controlled clinical studies. This was supported by favourable safety 
data from open-label studies in pre-symptomatic subjects, and subjects with infantile-onset and later-
onset SMA. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  is  a  risk  of  adverse  reactions  occuring  as  part  of  the  lumbar  puncture  procedure.  Potential 
difficulties  with  this  route  of  administration  may  be  seen  in  very  young  patients  and  those  with 
scoliosis. The use of ultrasound or other imaging techniques to assist with intrathecal administration of 
Spinraza, can be considered at the physician’s discretion. 
Thrombocytopenia  and  coagulation  abnormalities,  including  acute  severe  thrombocytopenia,  have 
been  observed  after  administration  of  other  subcutaneously  or  intravenously  administered  antisense 
oligonucleotides.  If  clinically  indicated,  platelet  and  coagulation  laboratory  testing  is  recommended 
prior to administration of Spinraza.  
Renal  toxicity  has  been  observed  after  administration  of  other  subcutaneously  and  intravenously 
administered antisense oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, urine protein testing (preferably using a 
first  morning  urine  specimen)  is  recommended.  For  persistent  elevated  urinary  protein,  further 
evaluation should be considered.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
SMA is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder where severe unmet medical need exists. Patients with 
the most severe forms never achieve the ability to sit independently and, without major supportive 
care, die before the age of 2 years. Patients with the milder forms of disease may survive longer, but 
have progressive disability. 
Maintaining function and slowing down disease progression is a priority for patients. A majority of the 
subjects with infantile-onset SMA treated with Spinraza in Studies CS3B and CS3A achieved clinically 
meaningful improvements in motor milestones and motor function.  These improvements include 
attainment of motor milestones such as independent sitting, standing, and walking, which are in stark 
contrast to the steady loss of motor milestones that is the hallmark of infantile-onset SMA as 
demonstrated by the control group of Study CS3B and natural history data.  
An even larger treatment effect was seen in patients with shorter disease duration at baseline which, 
in the context of the rapidly progressive decline observed in natural history studies of infantile-onset 
SMA makes the case for the initiation of treatment as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. 
This is supported by the available results from the ongoing SM201 study where pre-symptomatic 
children treated with Spinraza achieved milestones unexpected in infantile-onset SMA and more 
consistent with normal development.  
The interim results from the ongoing study CS4 show that subjects with later-onset SMA treated with 
Spinraza also achieved sustained and clinically meaningful benefits compared with controls.  The mean 
improvement in the HFMSE score from baseline at month 15 in patients treated with Spinraza 
exceeded the 3 points which is typically considered to represent a clinically meaningful, while a mean -

0.19 decline was observed in the control group. The results from the longitudinal assessment of 
subjects with later-onset SMA in study CS12 demonstrate additional milestone attainment and 
maintenance of effect over time in motor function, upper limb strength, and ambulation, all of which 
are in contrast with the decline typically seen in these patients following symptom onset. 
The majority of AEs and SAEs reported in subjects exposed to Spinraza were consistent with the 
nature and frequency of events typically occurring in the context of SMA. There are some class-related 
risks that have to be taken into consideration together with the risks stemming from the application 
procedure (LP), but no specific major risks were attributed to the product itself. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
While not all patients responded to treatment with Spinraza, the efficacy observed across multiple 
disease phenotypes of symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA patients as well as across trials and 
endpoints is evident, in stark contrast with the control groups and natural history data, and outweigh 
the risks essentially associated with the intrathecal administration. 
Clinical trial data are not available in patients with very severe, inborn symptoms and in patients with 
a mild, adult onset course. However, these patients are part of the continuum in phenotypes of one 
genetically defined but clinically heterogeneous disease. Based on the efficacy shown in the other, 
most prevalent phenotypes and the established mechanism of action of Spinraza, the therapeutic 
indication recommended by the CHMP includes all 5q-13.2 SMA patients.  
The decision to treat should be based on an individualised expert evaluation of the expected benefits 
balanced against the potential risks for that individual. In addition, the need for continuation of 
therapy should be reviewed regularly on an individual basis, especially as long-term data are not 
available at this point.  
In order to obtain additional data key to the benefit-risk of Spinraza, the CHMP recommended that 
conditions are included in the Marketing Authorisation, creating an obligation for the MAH to complete 
and present the results of two ongoing studies in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA patients, 
respectively. These results are expected to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the product, 
and the need to consider dose adjustment with the course of the disease being changed by the 
positive effects of the drug.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Spinraza is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Spinraza is favourable in the following indication: 
“Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy. “ 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

Description 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to evaluate the long term efficacy 
and safety of nusinersen in symptomatic patients with spinal muscular atrophy, the 
MAH should conduct and submit the results of the Phase 3, open-label extension 
study (SHINE, CS11). 
.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to evaluate the long term efficacy 
and safety of nusinersen in pre-symptomatic patients with spinal muscular atrophy, 
the MAH should conduct and submit the results of the Phase 2, open-label study 
(NURTURE (SM201)). 
Due date 
Submission of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The application for marketing authorisation of Sitagliptin Accord 25  mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated 
tablets is a generic application of a centrally authorised medicinal product according to Art. 10(1) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC,  as amended. In this assessment report, the name Sitagliptin Accord is used. 
The reference product is Januvia 25  mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets marketed by Merck 
Sharp & Dohme B.V., the  Netherlands, was first authorised in the European Union on 21 March 2007 
via the  centralised procedure (EU/1/07/383).   
The active substance sitagliptin  is an oral blood glucose-lowering drug used in the treatment of type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by 
elevated levels of blood glucose, which prevalence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Type 
2 diabetes mellitus is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is 
characterized by insulin  insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and 
eventual pancreatic beta-cell failure. In type 2 diabetes mellitus,  the body does not produce enough 
insulin or the cells ignore the insulin.  Over time, high blood sugar levels can increase the  risk for 
serious complications, including serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.  
Sitagliptin  is an active, potent,  and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4 
inhibitor)  that has been approved for the therapy of type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin 100  mg daily was well 
tolerated and provided effective and sustained improvement in HbA1c, FPG and PPG levels. Sitagliptin 
prolongs the  activity of proteins that  increase the release of insulin  after blood sugar rises, such as 
after a meal. Sitagliptin  metabolizes the naturally occurring incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic  polypeptide (GIP) resulting in enhanced glucose-
dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas and decreased hepatic glucose production.  
Therapeutic indication 
For adult patients  with  type 2 diabetes mellitus, sitagliptin  is indicated to improve glycaemic control: 
as monotherapy: 
- in patients  inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom  metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in  combination with: 
- metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not  provide adequate glycaemic control. 
- a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance. 
- a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) when 
use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with: 
- a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with  these medicinal 
products do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

- a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus dual therapy with  these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Sitagliptin  Accord is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with  or without  metformin) when diet and 
exercise plus stable dose of insulin  do not  provide adequate glycaemic control. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing  25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of 
Sitagliptin  (as hydrochloride monohydrate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose (E460),  calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium 
(E468),  magnesium stearate (E470b); 
Film-coating:   polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol 3350,  talc (E553b),  iron oxide yellow 
(E172)  and iron oxide red (E172). 
The finished product is packaged in PVC/PE/PVDC - Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC.   
2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General  Information 
The documentation  on the active substance is presented using an Active Substance Master File  (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The chemical name of sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate is (3R)-3-amino-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-
5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl]-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-1-one  hydrochloride 
monohydrate or (2R)-4-oxo-4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl]-
1-(2,4,5-trifluoro  phenyl)butan-2-amine hydrochloride monohydrate, corresponding to the  molecular 
formula C16H18ClF6N5O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 461.8 and the  following structure: 
Figure 1: active  substance structure 
The chemical structure of sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate was elucidated by a combination of 
Elemental Analysis, High  Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H 
& 13C NMR),  Infrared Spectroscopy, and UV Spectroscopy.  
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-Ray powder diffraction.  
Sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate is a white  to almost-white  powder. It is freely soluble in water 
across the physiological pH  range. Sitagliptin  incorporates a single chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely in  the active substance by chiral HPLC.    
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 11/35 
 
 
 
 
The active substance exhibits polymorphism and various polymorphic forms of sitagliptin  hydrochloride 
including solvates have been reported in the literature. The manufacturing process of Sitagliptin 
hydrochloride monohydrate followed by the  ASMF holder consistently produces the  same polymorphic 
form. The pXRD method,  which is part of the  specifications of the active substance, is suitable to 
differentiate the desired polymorphic form from the other forms of sitagliptin  hydrochloride. The final 
crystallisation conditions ensure the correct monohydrate polymorphic form is produced routinely.  
The polymorphic form does not change during drug substance storage (6M data at 40°C  / 75% RH and 
25°C / 60%  RH presented). 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture,  characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the  ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. During the procedure, a Major Objection 
was raised to request redefinition of the  starting materials. After redefinition of the initially proposed 
starting materials to well defined starting materials with  acceptable specifications, the manufacturing 
process, now involving multiple chemical transformation steps, was considered acceptable.  
Briefly, the manufacturing process of sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate consists of two  parallel 
branches each consisting of multiple chemical transformation steps to obtain the final drug substance.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting  materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in  accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with  regards to their origin and characterised. As 
part of the response to the MO on redefinition of starting materials, carry-over studies showing a 
purging of potential impurities from the redefined starting  materials were presented, and the risk of 
mutagenic impurities from the redefined starting materials was explained. All relevant dossier sections 
resulting from the redefinition of starting  materials were updated.  
All three impurities described in the Ph. Eur. in the monograph of sitagliptin  phosphate monohydrate 
are discussed: Impurity A (enantiomer) was characterised and is controlled via an in-house HPLC 
method. Impurities B and C are unspecified impurities that  are measured by the related substances 
HPLC method.  
Residual solvents and elemental impurities are discussed and batch results from three batches were 
provided. All discussed solvents are included in the drug substance specification with appropriate 
limits.  Data for elemental impurities shows that  all tested elements, including  Rh introduced in a 
catalyst in one process, are well below the respective control thresholds). All elements relevant for oral 
dosage form have been considered.  
The ASMF holder provided evidence that the intermediate, as supplied by both manufacturers (each 
using their own synthesis process), is of comparable and consistent  quality, and results in  active 
substance of comparable and consistent quality.  
The active substance is packaged in a double transparent Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) bag with 
strip seal followed by a Triple Laminated Sunlight  Barrier bag (TLSB) with  heat seal, kept in High 
Density Polyethylene (HDPE)  container. The LDPE bags comply with the  EU regulation EC 10/2011  as 
amended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 12/35 
 
 
 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, solubility (Ph. Eur.),  identity (IR, test 
for chloride by Ph. Eur.), hydrochloric acid content (potentiometry), water content  (KF), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC),  enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC),  assay (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), benzene (GC), polymorph identification (PXRD) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The active substance specification complies with  Ph. Eur. 2034 (“substances for pharmaceutical use”).  
Additionally, the specification is largely in line with  Ph. Eur. monograph 2778  applicable for Sitagliptin 
Phosphate Monohydrate, which  only differs from Sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate in the nature of 
the counter ion. All relevant quality parameters are specified.  
Microbiological quality is not tested. Taking into account that  the drug substance is a dry powder, the 
risk emanating from microbiological growth is considered as negligible. Accordingly, omission of 
microbiological testing  is acceptable. 
Residual solvents are controlled as per ICHQ3C, and relevant specifications have been established in 
the active substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in  accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay, impurities and enantiomeric purity testing  has been presented. 
Batch data on three consecutive production scale batches is presented. Results comply with  the drug 
substance specification and are similar irrespective of applied process.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to  24 months under long term 
conditions (25°C  / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75%  RH) 
according to  the ICH guidelines were provided. Also, photostability  testing  following the ICH guideline 
Q1B was performed. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release, except sulfated ash, which is acceptable. The 
analytical methods used were the  same as for release and are stability indicating.  Stress studies were 
performed exposing the Sitagliptin  HCl monohydrate to  alkaline hydrolysis, acidic hydrolysis, oxidative 
conditions, photolytic  conditions in solid and dissolved form, thermic energy and humidity. A significant 
degradation of the assay was found under base hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis and oxidative conditions. 
The active substance was stable during  photolytic and thermal stability  experiments. Mass balance and 
Sitagliptin  peak purity were appropriate.  
All tested parameters were within  the specifications, and no trends were observed.  
Confirmation was provided that stability  studies according to long term and accelerated ICH conditions 
on first three production scale batches obtained by the modified manufacturing process are initiated, 
The stability results indicate that  the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability  results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at a 
temperature not  exceeding to 25°C in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing  25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of 
sitagliptin  (as hydrochloride monohydrate salt) as active substance. The different tablet strengths  are 
appropriately differentiated by their colour, size and debossing: 
•  25 mg Sitagliptin  (as hydrochloride monohydrate): Pink coloured, round, levelled edge, film-
coated tablet debossed with  “S3” on one side and plain on the other side. Diameter: 6 to 6.40 
mm 
•  50 mg Sitagliptin  (as hydrochloride monohydrate): Light  beige coloured, round, bevelled edge, 
film-coated tablet debossed with  “S4” on one side and plain on the other side. Diameter: 8 to 
8.40  mm 
•  100 mg Sitagliptin  (as hydrochloride monohydrate): Beige coloured, round, levelled edge, film-
coated tablet debossed with  “S7” on one side and plain on the other side. Diameter: 10 to 
10.40  mm 
All three strengths of tablet are manufactured from a common blend and the tablet  cores have 
quantitatively proportional compositions. 
The quality target product  profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form, containing 
sitagliptin  hydrochloride monohydrate equivalent to 25,  50  or 100  mg  sitagliptin,  with  a  shelf-life of at 
least 24 months at room temperature, bioequivalent to the reference product Januvia.  
The  qualitative  formulation was  developed in  line  with  the  reference product  and  the  quantity  of  each 
excipient was optimized based on design of experiments and one-factor-at-a-time studies. Assay, related 
substances,  uniformity  of  dosage units,  disintegration  time  and  dissolution  were  identified  as  critical 
quality attributes  (CQAs), and therefore identified for tracking in  the risk assessment.  
Drug substance attributes  were assessed, and the impact that  each attribute  could have on the drug 
product CQAs was subject to a risk assessment. As such, the solid-state form, particle size distribution 
(PSD), hygroscopicity, residual solvents, moisture content,  process impurities and chemical stability 
were investigated.  
The active substance is a BCS class I substance, hence PSD will not  affect dissolution.  Although PSD is 
not critical, a PSD specification was introduced by the finished product manufacturer, to ensure 
consistency of future supply of active substance batches. The active substance shows polymorphism. 
However, the  ASMF holder consistently provides the  same polymorphic form. Submitted  data 
demonstrated stability of the polymorphic form during the tabletting  process and stored under 
accelerated conditions (6 months at 40  °C /75%RH).  Although the active substance is non-hygroscopic 
and the moisture content is controlled at release, the impact of moisture, and the  impact of chemical 
stability of the active substance on the  finished product attributes  were judged as medium risk.   
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur. 
standards, except for the film-coating  material which  is controlled according to in-house  specifications. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list  of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
A study showed the compatibility of the excipients with the active substance. Information about relevant 
functionality related excipient characteristics is provided.

A bioequivalence study was conducted with  the Sitagliptin Accord 100  mg tablets, against the reference 
product  Januvia  100  mg  tablets.  The  Sitagliptin  Accord  100  mg  tablets  biobatch  used  in  the 
bioequivalence study, and were manufactured with the  proposed commercial manufacturing process. 
The dissolution behaviour of Sitagliptin  Accord (100 mg) and the reference product Januvia 100 mg 
was investigated in the physiological pH  range between 1.2 to 6.8  (0.1 M  HCl pH 1.2,  acetate buffer pH 
4.5 and phosphate buffer pH  6.8). Sink conditions could be achieved in all dissolution media due to the 
high solubility  of the tablets.  The drug substance in both  test and reference tablets was observed to be 
rapidly dissolving (i.e. more than  85% within  15min) at  all tested  pHs.  
Discriminatory power of the dissolution  method could not be shown by testing  a batch showing 
elevated hardness, or lower disintegrant  level. Since the drug product contains a BCS class I active 
substances with very high solubility  over the physiological pH range and with rapid or very rapid 
dissolution, disintegration  testing is considered more discriminatory than dissolution testing  according 
to the presented data. Therefore, disintegration testing instead of dissolution testing  is included in the 
specification. 
A comparison of the  dissolution profiles of the 25 mg tablets  and 50  mg tablets (which are dose-
proportional to the 100 mg-tablets)  with  the biobatch (100 mg), was performed in the same 
dissolution media (0.1 M  HCl pH 1.2,  acetate buffer pH 4.5  and phosphate buffer pH 6.8),  showing 
similar dissolution profiles. Consequently, a biowaiver was granted for the 25 and 50 mg strengths.  
A  risk  assessment  of  the  overall  drug  product  manufacturing  process  was  performed to  identify  the 
process parameters of  each unit  operation that  may affect the  CQAs of the  final drug product.  All risks 
were  assigned as  medium  (or low),  except the  compression force/tablet hardness  and  the  lubrication 
time of the blend, which  were estimated as high risk for their  potential impact on the dissolution  profile 
of the tablets. Further experiments were performed subsequently for each medium and high-risk process 
step  to  identify  the  suitable  process  parameter  range.  After  detailed  experimentation  and  scale-up 
studies,  the initial  manufacturing  process risk assessment was updated,  and the  risks were reduced to 
an acceptable level (low) and a control strategy was established. 
The  primary  packaging  for  the  finished  product  is  PVC/PE/PVDC-aluminium  blisters.  The  material 
complies with  Ph. Eur. and EC requirements.  
The primary packaging for the  bulk storage of intermediates (i.e. lubricated blend, compressed tablets 
and coated tablets)  are double lined LDPE bags kept in in-process containers. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The manufacturing  process consists of  ten  main steps:  sifting,  pre-compaction blending,  blending,  dry 
granulation,  pre-lubrication  and  lubrication,  sifting  and  milling,  blending,  compression,  film  coating, 
packaging, along with the applied in process controls (IPCs). The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three commercial-scale batches. It has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process for film-coated tablets.   
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 15/35 
 
 
 
Pre-lubrication  time  and  lubrication  time,  and  corresponding  mixing  speed,  were  defined  as  critical 
parameters  in  view  of  blend  uniformity.  Furthermore,  roller  pressure  during  dry  granulation  (roller 
compaction) was defined as a critical parameter. 
The available development data,  the process validation  data and  batch  analysis data  from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed control strategy. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification(s)  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (HPLC  and UV), identification of titanium  dioxide (colour test), identification 
of iron oxide (colour test),  identification of chloride (precipitation), assay (HPLC),  degradation products 
(HPLC),  water content  (Ph. Eur. 2.5.32),  uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.  2.9.40),  disintegration 
(Ph. Eur. 2.9.3)  and microbial quality (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12  and Ph. Eur. 2.6.13).The  limits for individually 
specified impurities as well as unspecified degradation products are in accordance with the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for Sitagliptin  tablets. Other impurity are specified with  limits   complying with  ICH Q3B. 
During the procedure, the specification for total  impurities and for water content were tightened by the 
applicant. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product was assessed following a risk-
based approach in  line with the  ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Supportive batch analysis 
data on 3 batches, generated with  an ICP-MS method, was provided, demonstrating that  each relevant 
elemental impurity  was not  detected above 30%  of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented supportive batch data, it can be concluded that  it is not  necessary to include any 
elemental impurity  controls in  the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities  is satisfactory.  
The risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the finished product was 
initially assessed as not  sufficiently comprehensive, and a MO was raised, to request the Applicant to  
consider all suspected and actual root causes in  line with the  “Questions and answers for marketing 
authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004  referral on nitrosamine impurities in  human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020).  The Applicant updated the risk 
assessment to include the discussion on potential nitrosamines likely to be introduced based on the 
manufacturing process of the drug substance and interactions between the components of the drug 
substance, excipients and packaging materials. All nitrosamines that  could potentially be formed taking 
into account all parent amine entities (secondary, tertiary and quaternary) that  could be present in the 
components of the  drug product  (drug substance, excipients, water and packaging materials) have 
been considered. Based on the  additional information provided, overall it was accepted that  no risk was 
identified of the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. This is sufficient and confirmatory testing is not  required. The batch results provided 
by the Applicant (NDMA, NDEA, NDIPA, NEIPA and NDBA in three active substance batches, and NDMA 
and NDEA in 6 finished product batches for each strength)  are considered supportive. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing  has been presented. 
For each of the strengths, batch analysis results were provided for 3 batches manufactured at commercial 
scale  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the 
intended product specification.

2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
For each of the strengths, stability  data from three commercial scale batches of finished  product stored 
for  up  to  24  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25°C  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated  conditions  (40°C  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  tablet 
batches  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Additionally,  stability  data  from  the  same  tablet  batches  stored  for up  to  12  months  under long  term 
conditions  (25°C  / 60%  RH)  and  for up  to 6 months  under accelerated conditions  (40°C /  75%  RH)  in 
bulk  pouches  (500  count)  representative of  the  laminated  bulk  pouches  (5000  count)  used  for  bulk 
storage of the coated tablets, were provided.  
Samples were tested for the  stability indicating parameters. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating.  No significant changes and no trends have been observed over the study period.  
In addition, one batch per strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  photolytic  degradation  of  the  drug  product  was 
observed.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years, with no special storage conditions, 
as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4),  and the proposed holding time of 12 months  for the bulk 
packed tablets, prior to primary blister packaging, are acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.   
During the procedure, two Major Objections were raised. A first one to request redefinition of the 
starting materials due to the fact that  the synthetic process of the active substance as initially 
described in S.2.2 comprised only two chemical transformation steps. The starting  materials were re-
defined as requested. 
A second MO was raised on the risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the finished product, since it initially  was not  sufficiently comprehensive. The Applicant provided a 
revised risk assessment and it  was accepted that no risk was identified of the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not  applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sitagliptin  are well known. As 
sitagliptin  is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant  has not  provided additional 
studies and further studies are not required. A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which  is based on up-to-date and adequate 
scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line 
with  the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered 
acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that  no further non-clinical studies are required. 
The generic formulation Sitagliptin  Accord contains a different salt form of the  active substance 
sitagliptin  (hydrochloride monohydrate) as compared to the reference product, Januvia, which contains 
sitagliptin  as the  phosphate salt.  Although the generic product  has a different salt form, according to 
Article 10(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC  (as amended), “the different salts, esters, isomers, mixtures of 
isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same active 
substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with  regard to safety and/or efficacy.” Following 
the assessment of all data provided, the CHMP  concluded that  sitagliptin  hydrochloride does not differ 
significantly with  regard to safety and efficacy in comparison with  the reference medicinal product. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) studies were submitted.  This was justified by the applicant 
as the introduction of Sitagliptin  Accord, 25 mg, 50  mg, 100 mg film-coated tablets, manufactured by 
Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to  result in any significant  increase in the combined 
sales volumes for all sitagliptin  containing products and the exposure of the  environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The range of non-clinical data presented in the dossier is appropriate for a generic application. The non-
clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with  the SmPC of the reference product.  
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  non-clinical  overview  is  based  on  up-to-date  and  adequate  scientific 
literature. It is agreed that  no further non-clinical studies  are required. 
Taking into account the data submitted  by the applicant and the established essential similarity with 
the reference product Januvia, the use of sitagliptin  as indicated is not  likely to present risks to the 
environment, hence no further environmental risk assessment is considered necessary for this  generic 
product. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the  literature with regard to  non-clinical data of Sitagliptin  Accord and justifications that 
the different salt of the active substance does not  differ significantly in properties with regard to safety 
and efficacy of the  reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP.  This is in 
accordance with the  relevant guideline and additional  non-clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. The product is considered approvable from a non-clinical viewpoint.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic application of a centrally authorised medicinal product according to 
Art. 10(1)  of Directive 2001/83/EC  as amended. The Applicant has developed Sitagliptin Accord film-
coated tablets as generic to the reference medicinal product Januvia 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg film-
coated tablets.  
Relevant for the assessment are the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98)  as well as the  Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09)  and Sitagliptin film-coated tablets 25,  50 and 100 mg product-specific 
bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/158934/2016).    
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
Human pharmacology, efficacy and safety of sitagliptin  are well known. The Clinical Overview on the 
clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety is acceptable. The submitted  literature references included in 
the overview are considered appropriate and relevant for the proposed indications. The proposed 
generic medicinal product contains a different salt of the active substance (hydrochloride 
monohydrate) as compared to the reference medicinal product (phosphate monohydrate). However, 
following the assessment of the data and justifications provided the  CHMP concluded that the  different 
salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in  properties with  regard to safety and efficacy 
of the reference product has been provided. 
Since this  is a generic application, the Applicant performed a bioequivalence study to show essential 
similarity of the  test product to the  originator.  
The Applicant has not  submitted any other clinical studies and no further clinical studies are required 
according to  the Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The proposed indication and posology are in line with  the reference product. 
GCP aspect 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement  to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption 
A strength biowaiver was requested for Sitagliptin  Accord 25 mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets.   
The Applicant made reference to the Guideline on the  Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev. 1 –  January. 2010)  according to which Sitagliptin  25 mg and 50 mg 
film-coated tablets satisfy the conditions for waiver of the  bioequivalence study conducted with  100 mg 
film-coated tablets as discussed below: 
a) Sitagliptin  25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film coated tablets are manufactured by the  same drug 
product manufacturer process. 
b) The qualitative composition of the  different strengths  (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) is the  same. 
c) The composition of the 25  mg, 50 mg and 100 mg strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. the 
ratio between the amounts of each excipient to the amount of Sitagliptin  is the same for all strengths. 
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 19/35 
 
 
 
d) Considering the Biopharmaceutical classification system of the  product, Sitagliptin is a BCS Class I 
compound demonstrating high solubility compound with  complete absorption. 
e) The results of in vitro dissolution tests at  three different buffers (normally pH 0.1  N HCl, 4.5  and 
6.8) of Sitagliptin  25 mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets are comparable with  Sitagliptin  100 mg film-
coated tablets (test product of bio-equivalence study). 
f) According to the  EMA guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev. 1/ Corr**, (Section 4.1.6 -  strength to be investigated)), for drug 
product with  linear pharmacokinetics of the active substance, for which all the above conditions a) to 
c) and e) the bioequivalence study should in  general be conducted at the  highest strength.  
According to the  current publications,  the pharmacokinetics of Sitagliptin is linear as follows: 
• Plasma AUC of sitagliptin  increased in a dose-proportional manner, and Sitagliptin shows linear 
pharmacokinetics. [Januvia, SmPC (2018] 
• The EU product-specific bioequivalence guidance of Sitagliptin states that  due to the linear 
pharmacokinetics of Sitagliptin, bioequivalence study should be conducted at the highest strength  (100 
mg) and other strength(s) (25  mg &  50 mg) are eligible for bio-waiver [Sitagliptin,  EU Guidance -
2016]. 
Based on above justifications, the bioequivalence study was conducted on the highest strength  i.e. 100 
mg and a Bio-Waiver was requested for the lower strengths of 50 mg and 25 mg. 
The Applicant provided additional data during the procedure to demonstrate that the  applied for 
generic medicinal product satisfy the  BCS-based biowaiver requirements, in line with  Appendix III of 
Guideline on the  Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev. 1/Corr –  revised 
2010). 
The extent of absorption of sitagliptin  is >85 % and the absorption/permeability criteria for a BCS class 
I biowaiver is fulfilled. The qualitative composition of the test  and reference products is similar. 
However, the  proposed product contains sitagliptin  HCl as opposed to Januvia where sitagliptin 
phosphate is used. None of the excipients are known to affect the bioavailability and the use of 
different salts is considered acceptable. In addition, sitagliptin  is not considered to be a narrow 
therapeutic index drug. 
In conclusion, the demonstration for a BCS class I (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) based 
biowaiver can be accepted from a clinical point of view. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted  two bioequivalence studies

The design of the study is in line with  the requirements of the  Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 01 – January 2010)  and with  Sitagliptin product-
specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/158934/2016),  therefore, it is considered appropriate.  
The test product is an immediate release formulation; thus,  a single dose bioequivalence study is 
appropriate.  
According to the  SmPC, the reference product can be taken with  or without  food. Thus, the 
bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions  is acceptable.  
The bioequivalence study was conducted with  the highest strength  which is also in line with Guideline 
on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 01 – January 2010)  and with 
Sitagliptin  product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/158934/2016). 
Plasma samples are collected over 48 hours. Frequent sampling was planned around expected tmax 
(1-4 hours).  
Considering the  median tmax occurring 1 to  4 hours post-dose, the sampling period and the  sampling 
scheme seems adequate to estimate the primary PK parameters of sitagliptin.   
Since AUC0-t covers at least 80% of AUC0-∞, the sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration 
time curve long enough.  
Tmax was not observed in any subject in the  first sample time point.  
The apparent terminal t1/2 following  a 100  mg oral dose of sitagliptin  is approximately 12.4 hours, thus 
the washout period of 08 days is more than  5 half-life of the active substance. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were: Cmax and AUC0-t.  
The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were: AUC0-∞, Tmax, Kel, T1/2, %AUCextrapolation and AUCt/AUC
∞. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters are adequate for a bioequivalence trial with  immediate-release 
formulation. 
Statistical methods   
Statistical analysis was performed on ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters by using software 
SAS Version 9.4.  Least square mean differences (Test to Reference) of the test  to reference 
formulation for the  pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for Sitagliptin were estimated using 
SAS procedure. 
Individual and Mean plasma concentration vs. time plots  were generated on both Linear and Semi-log 
axis for Sitagliptin. 
Descriptive statistics (no.  of subjects analysed, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation, median and maximum) of all the  primary pharmacokinetic parameters were 
calculated and reported for Sitagliptin. 
Actual time points of the sample collection were used for the calculation of PK parameters. All 
concentration values Below Limit of Quantification were set to zero for all pharmacokinetic calculations. 
Missing sample values (MS) or non-reportable values (NRV) of the plasma concentration data were 
treated as ‘missing values’ and reasons for their missing were documented. Further these missing

values were kept blank in Phoenix® WinNonlin  version 8.1 since this software recognizes this blank cell 
as “Missing” and does not consider for the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Individual AUC0-t parameters were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule.  
The Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t at a significance level of 5% (alpha 
=0.05)  of Sitagliptin was subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) by using PROC GLM. 
ANOVA model include Sequence, treatment and Period as fixed effects and Subject (Sequence) as a 
random effect. Sequence effect has been tested using Subject (Sequence) as error term. 
Non-parametric analysis of tmax was performed on untransformed data. 
Two one-sided 90%  confidence interval for the ratio of mean between drug formulations has been 
calculated for Ln-transformed data of Cmax and AUC0-t of Sitagliptin. 
Ratio of Geometric least square means for Sitagliptin of test and reference formulations has been 
computed and reported for Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, and AUC0-t. 
Ratio (%) of Test and Reference formulations for each individual subject has been provided for 
untransformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for Sitagliptin. 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence 
The acceptance criteria for bioequivalence were that the  entire confidence intervals for the difference 
of means of Ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t should be within  80.00%  -125.00%.  Standard 
bioequivalence criteria are proposed for the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints Cmax and AUC0-t, which 
is adequate.

Table 3:  ANOVA  Summary Table – Sitagliptin 
The pharmacokinetic parameter data including  the confidence intervals and point estimates presented 
by the Applicant are in line with  the acceptance criteria of the  Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr – revised 2010).  Linear and log-linear plots 
have been submitted. The 90% confidence intervals for the ln-transformed values for AUC0-t and 
Cmax were within  the 80.00 –  125% limit  and are considered acceptable.   
The Applicant did not report any statistically significant  sequence, period or treatment effect. 
Safety  data 
Safety parameters were assessed in all 36 randomized subjects throughout  the study until  completion. 
Thus, the safety population comprise of total 36 randomized subjects.  
A total of two (02)  adverse events of vomiting  were reported by two (02)  subjects during the  study. All 
adverse events were possible related to the  study drug and mild in  nature. All the  adverse events were 
resolved. The reported adverse events of vomiting are already described in the  SmPC of the reference 
product. 
There were no clinically significant findings  in the vital signs assessment or the laboratory tests in any 
of the subjects in the study. 
Administrations of test and reference products to healthy subjects were safe and well tolerated with  no 
apparent differences in safety profiles. 
Study 62020 
Study design  
An open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment,  two-period, two-sequence, single dose, and 
crossover oral bioequivalence study of Sitagliptin  100 mg Film  Coated Tablets of Laurus Labs Limited, 
India, comparing with  that  of Januvia 100 mg Film  coated tablets  (sitagliptin)  of Merck Sharp & Dohme 
Ltd,  Hertford Road, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, ENl l 9BU, United  Kingdom in healthy, adult, human 
subjects under fasting  conditions. 
The design of the study is in line with  the requirements of the  Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 01 – January 2010)  and with  Sitagliptin product-
specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/158934/2016),  therefore, it is considered appropriate.  
The test product is an immediate release formulation; thus,  a single dose bioequivalence study is 
appropriate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 25/35 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the  SmPC, the reference product can be taken with  or without  food. Thus, the 
bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions  is acceptable.  
The bioequivalence study was conducted with  the highest strength,  which is also in line with  Guideline 
on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 01 – January 2010)  and with 
Sitagliptin  product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/158934/2016). 
Plasma samples are collected over 48 hours. Frequent sampling was planned around expected tmax (1-
4 hours).  
Considering the  median tmax occurring 1 to  4 hours post-dose, the sampling period and the  sampling 
scheme seems adequate to estimate the primary PK parameters of sitagliptin.   
Since AUC0-t covers at least 80% of AUC0-∞, the sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration 
time curve long enough.  
Tmax was not observed in any subject in the  first sample time point.  
The apparent terminal t1/2 following  a 100  mg oral dose of sitagliptin  is approximately 12.4 hours, thus 
the washout period of 08 days is more than  5 half-life of the active substance. 
The choice of the reference product is appropriate.  
In this new performed BE study the same batch of the test  product, and reference product have been 
used. This is agreed as the batches are unexpired.  
Certificates of analysis have been provided and the difference in content  of active substance between 
reference and test  product is less than 5.0%. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters are: Cmax and AUC0-t.  
The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters are: AUC0-inf, AUCt/AUCinf, Tmax, t1/2, Residual Area and Kel. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters are adequate for a bioequivalence trial with  immediate-release 
formulation. 
Statistical methods 
For Sitagliptin,  analysis of variance was performed on the ln-transformed data Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-
inf. All ANOVA were performed with SAS® Studio 3.6 (Basic Edition),  (SAS® Institute Inc. USA) 
software. 
The model included group, sequence, sequence*group, period (group), treatment, treatment*group 
and subject (sequence*group) as fixed effects.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence 
The acceptance criteria for bioequivalence were that the  entire confidence intervals for the difference 
of means of Ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t should be within  80.00%  -125.00%.  Standard 
bioequivalence criteria are proposed for the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints Cmax and AUC0-t, which 
is adequate. 
Results 
Subject 28 was detected as an outlier for Cmax. The results include the outlier.

The significant sequence effects detected for all PK parameter AUC0-t, Cmax and AUC(0-∞) have been 
explained that  might be due to unbalanced sequences. An adequate washout period was established 
and the pre-dose samples do not show any detectable levels (>  5% of Cmax) of the drugs in all the 
volunteers, therefore the  presence of sequence effect can be accepted and considered not to  influence 
the comparison of the formulations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 28/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The significant period by group detected for the LnCmax is considered not to influence the results of 
the BE study as no significant treatment effect was associated and the  study was balanced. 
The study satisfies all the scientific and statistical  criteria (for example protocol, validation, 
concentration data, statistical  analysis, confidence interval). 
The pharmacokinetic parameter data including  the confidence intervals and point estimates presented 
by the Applicant are in line with  the acceptance criteria of the  Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr – revised 2010).  Linear and semi-log plots have 
been submitted  for the mean plasma concentration versus time for all subjects. The issue was solved.  
The 90% confidence intervals for the ln-transformed values for AUC0-t and Cmax were within  the 80.00 
– 125%  limit and are considered acceptable.   
The results without  the outlier have been also provided. In addition, in  this case, the acceptance 
criteria for bioequivalence have been fulfilled as the entire confidence intervals for the difference of 
means of Ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t are within  80.00%  -125.00%. 
Safety  data 
Safety parameters have been assessed in all 36 randomized subjects  
A total of three (03) AEs, two (02)  of headache and 01 AE of generalized rash, were reported by three 
(03) subjects during study. Out  of these, two  (02) AE’s of headache and one (01)  AE of generalized 
rash were considered possibly related to the study drug and were moderate in nature. All these AE’s 
were resolved. Headache and rash are adverse reactions included in the SmPC of the Reference 
product.  
There were no clinically significant findings  in the vital signs assessment or the laboratory tests in any 
of the subjects in the study. 
Administrations of test and reference products to healthy subjects were safe and well tolerated with  no 
apparent differences in safety profiles. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion   
It has been demonstrated from literature data that  the extent of absorption of sitagliptin  is >85 %  and 
the absorption/permeability criteria for a BCS class I biowaiver is fulfilled. In addition,  the high 
solubility of the drug substance has been demonstrated in  a carried out  solubility study using shake-
flask method according to the guideline. 
Based on the solubility study and literature information both Sitagliptin  HCl monohydrate and 
Sitagliptin  phosphate monohydrate belong to  BCS class I and therefore, in vitro data could be used to 
justify the BCS- biowaiver and to  confirm the bioequivalence between the test and reference medicinal 
products. Comparative dissolution profiles between the bio-batch  and additional strengths  of test 
formulation and in addition for each strength  in comparison with  respective of the reference medicinal 
product demonstrated the similarity without  further mathematical evaluation as more than 85% of the 
labelled amount  of the drug was released within  15 minutes. 
The BCS-based biowaiver requirements according to Appendix III of Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr – revised 2010)  are considered fulfilled.  
In order to confirm the reliability of the  conclusion of the initial  BE study, the Applicant conducted an 
additional supportive bioequivalence study using the  same unexpired Test and Reference bio-batches 
that  have been used in the initial  BE study. The 90% confidence intervals of the  ratios are within  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 29/35 
 
 
 
acceptance range (0.80–1.25)  for the  ln transformed Cmax, AUC0-t  and AUC0-∞  therefore the  results 
of the new study confirmed the bioequivalence between test and reference products. 
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.2.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, the Applicant provided one bioequivalence study and literature data on 
clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety, which is considered appropriate for a generic marketing 
authorisation application. Sitagliptin  Accord contains a different salt  of the  active substance 
(hydrochloride monohydrate) in comparison with  the reference medicinal product (phosphate 
monohydrate). A justification that  the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly 
in properties with  regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product has been provided and is 
considered acceptable.  
The bioequivalence study was a single dose, open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment,  two-
sequence, two-period, crossover study in  healthy, adult  under fasting conditions to demonstrate 
essential similarity of Sitagliptin  100 mg film coated tablets with  Januvia (sitagliptin)  100  mg film 
coated tablets.  
According to the  SmPC of the reference product, Sitagliptin  can be taken with  or without  food. 
Sitagliptin  is a high  solubility compound with complete absorption with linear pharmacokinetics over 
the therapeutic dose range and the use of highest  strength is recommended in line with the  Product -
specific bioequivalence guideline. Therefore, the selection of the highest  dose, 100  mg, to be used in 
the bioequivalence study under fasting conditions is justified and in accordance with the  guidelines.  
Overall, the study design is acceptable and in line with  the pharmacokinetic properties of Sitagliptin.  
The sampling period was sufficient, the sampling schedule and wash-out  period were adequate taking 
into account the  tmax and apparent terminal t1/2. Since AUC0-t covers at least 80% of AUC0-∞, the 
sampling schedule covers the plasma concentration time  curve long enough. 
The population was chosen according to  the guidelines. Bioanalytical method had satisfactory 
performance and was adequately validated. The pharmacokinetic and statistical  methods applied were 
appropriate for a single-dose study.  
The 90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables Cmax and AUC0-t were 
within  the conventional bioequivalence range of 80.00% to  125.00%.   
Both formulations were well tolerated in the BE study.  
During the procedure, the Applicant applied for a BCS biowaiver and performed an additional 
supportive bioequivalence study using the  same unexpired Test and Reference bio-batches that have 
been used in the  initial BE study in order to confirm the reliability of the conclusion of the  initial BE 
study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/181231/2022  
Page 30/35 
 
 
 
The Applicant also demonstrated that the  applied for generic medicinal product satisfy the BCS-based 
biowaiver requirements as mentioned in Appendix III of Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr – revised 2010).  This is considered acceptable. 
The acceptance criteria for the new performed bioequivalence study have been fulfilled as the entire 
confidence intervals for the difference of means of Ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t are within  80.00% -
125.00%. 
Additionally, the applicant requested a biowaiver for Sitagliptin  Accord 25 mg and 50 mg film-coated 
tablets. To support the request, a justification and results of comparative dissolution tests have been 
provided. The in vitro dissolution tests comparing the in vitro dissolution similarity between additional 
strengths and the test  bio-batch over physiological pH range were conducted. Comparative dissolution 
profiles demonstrated that  the bio-batch and additional strengths of test formulation were essentially 
similar over the physiological pH range. The Applicant has not  calculated the similarity factor since 
more than  85% of the labelled amount of the drug was released within  15 minutes, based on average 
value for dissolution from 12 units.  Therefore, dissolution profiles can be accepted as similar, without 
further mathematical calculations. In conclusion, the in  vivo bioequivalence study for strengths 25  mg 
and 50 mg can be waived because all the biowaiver criteria have been fulfilled. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) Sitagliptin  Accord is considered bioequivalent with 
Januvia. 
A summary of the  literature with regard to  clinical data of Sitagliptin  Accord and justifications that  the 
different salt of the active substance does not  differ significantly in properties with  regard to  safety and 
efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the  CHMP. This is in accordance 
with  the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not  considered necessary. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded from a clinical 
viewpoint.

a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus dual therapy with  these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control. 
Sitagliptin  Accord is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with  or without  metformin) when diet and 
exercise plus stable dose of insulin  do not  provide adequate glycaemic control. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but  an adequate summary of the 
available non-clinical information for the  active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not  contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the  active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with  a single dose, open-label, balanced, randomized, 
two-treatment,  two-sequence, two-period, crossover study in healthy, adult under fasting conditions. 
The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was 
in line with  the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling 
time as well as wash-out  period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic 
and statistical methods applied were adequate.  
The test formulation of Sitagliptin Accord 100 mg film-coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence when compared with  the Januvia (sitagliptin)  100 mg film coated tablets. The point 
estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t and Cmax were all contained 
within  the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00  to 125.00%].  Bioequivalence of the 
two formulations was demonstrated. 
The Applicant also demonstrated that the  applied for generic medicinal product satisfy the BCS-based 
biowaiver requirements as mentioned in Appendix III of Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr – revised 2010). 
This application contains a different salt of the active substance. A summary of the literature with 
regard to non-clinical and clinical data of Sitagliptin Accord and justifications  that the  different salt of 
the active substance does not differ significantly  in properties with  regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP.  This is in  accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
The application contains adequate quality data.  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
Having considered the data submitted  in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the 
product information.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PALFORZIA is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis 
of peanut allergy. PALFORZIA may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. 
PALFORZIA should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicine should be administered under the supervision of a health care professional qualified in 
the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. 
Initial dose escalation and the first dose of each new up-dosing level are to be administered in a health 
care setting prepared to manage potential severe allergic reactions. 
Self-injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) must be available to the patient at all times. 
Posology 
Treatment with PALFORZIA is administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial dose escalation, up-dosing, 
and maintenance.  
For each dose level during up-dosing, the doses given in clinic and at home should be from the same 
batch to avoid variations in the potency range (see section 4.4). 
The dose configurations for each phase of dosing are provided in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

A dose level can be considered tolerated if no more than transient symptoms are observed with no or 
minimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Initial dose escalation phase 
Initial dose escalation is administered on a single day under the supervision of a health care 
professional in a health care setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic reactions, 
including anaphylaxis.  
Initial dose escalation is administered in sequential order on a single day beginning at 0.5 mg and 
completing with 6 mg (see Table 1).

Each dose should be separated by an observation period of 20 to 30 minutes.  
No dose level should be omitted.  
Patients must be observed after the last dose for at least 60 minutes until suitable for discharge.  
Treatment must be discontinued if symptoms requiring medical intervention (e.g., use of adrenaline) 
occur with any dose during initial dose escalation. 
Patients who tolerate at least the 3 mg single dose PALFORZIA during initial dose escalation must 
return to the health care setting for initiation of up-dosing. 
If possible, up-dosing should begin the day after initial dose escalation.  
If the patient is unable to begin up-dosing within 4 days, initial dose escalation should be repeated in a 
health care setting. 
Up-dosing phase 
Initial dose escalation must be completed before starting up-dosing. 
Up-dosing consists of 11 dose levels and is initiated at a 3 mg dose (see Table 2).  
The first dose of each new up-dosing level is administered under the supervision of a health care 
professional in a health care setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic reactions, 
including anaphylaxis. Patients should be observed for at least 60 minutes after administering the first 
dose of a new up-dosing level until suitable for discharge.  
If the patient tolerates the first dose of the increased dose level, the patient may continue that dose 
level at home.  
All the dose levels in Table 2 must be administered in sequential order at 2-week intervals if tolerated. 
No dose level should be omitted. Patients must not progress through up-dosing more rapidly than 
shown in Table 2.

No more than one dose should be consumed per day. Patients should be instructed not to consume a 
dose at home on the same day as a dose consumed in the clinic. 
Care should be taken to ensure that patients have only one dose level in their possession at any time. 
Dose modification or discontinuation should be considered for patients who do not tolerate up-dosing 
as described in Table 2 (see Dose modification instructions).  
Maintenance therapy 
All dose levels of up-dosing must be completed before starting maintenance.  
The maintenance dose of PALFORZIA is 300 mg daily.  
Table 3:  Daily dosing configuration for maintenance 
Presentation of dose 
1 × 300 mg sachet 
Total daily dose 
300 mg 
Daily maintenance is required to maintain the tolerability and clinical effects of PALFORZIA.  
Efficacy data currently are available for up to 24 months of treatment with PALFORZIA. No 
recommendation can be made about the duration of treatment beyond 24 months. 
The effect of stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy has not been evaluated.  
If treatment with PALFORZIA is stopped, patients must continue to carry self-injectable adrenaline at 
all times.   
Dose modification instructions 
Dose modifications are not appropriate during initial dose escalation. 
Temporary dose modification of PALFORZIA may be required for patients who experience allergic 
reactions during up-dosing or maintenance or for practical reasons for patient management. Allergic 
reactions, including gastrointestinal reactions, that are severe, recurrent, bothersome, or last longer 
than 90 minutes during up-dosing or maintenance should be actively managed with dose 
modifications. Clinical judgment should be used to determine the best course of action on a patient by 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient basis. This can include maintaining the dose level for longer than 2 weeks, reducing, or 
withholding PALFORZIA doses.  
Management of consecutive missed doses 
Missed doses of PALFORZIA may pose a significant risk to patients due to potential loss of 
desensitisation. The guidelines in Table 4 are to be used for managing missed doses. 
Table 4:  Management of consecutive missed doses 
Consecutive missed doses  Action 
1 to 2 days 
3 to 4 days 
5 to 14 days 
Greater than 14 days 
Patients may resume treatment at the same dose level at home. 
Patients may resume treatment at the same dose level under 
medical supervision in a health care setting based on medical 
judgment. 
Patients may resume up-dosing with PALFORZIA under 
medical supervision in a health care setting at a dose of 50% or 
less of the last tolerated dose. 
Patient compliance should be evaluated and it should be 
considered to re-start up-dosing at 3 mg under supervision in 
a health care setting or to discontinue treatment completely.  
Following a dose reduction due to missed doses, up-dosing should be resumed as described in Table 2. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of PALFORZIA therapy initiated in patients aged over 17 years has not been 
established. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of PALFORZIA therapy in children aged less than 4 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
The powder must be taken orally after mixing with an age-appropriate soft food. 
Capsules are not to be ingested. Inhalation of the powder must be avoided. 
To empty the contents of each capsule, the two ends of the capsule should be pulled apart gently, and 
gently rolled between the finger and thumb. Sachets should be opened by carefully cutting or tearing 
along the line indicated. 
The entire dose of PALFORZIA powder should be emptied onto a few spoonfuls of refrigerated or 
room temperature semisolid food (e.g., fruit puree, yogurt, rice-pudding) and mixed well. Liquid 
(e.g., milk, water, juice) must not be used. 
Hands should be washed immediately after handling PALFORZIA capsule(s) or sachets. 
Each dose taken at home should be consumed daily with a meal at approximately the same time each 
day, preferably in the evening. PALFORZIA should not be taken on an empty stomach or after fasting.  
Alcohol should not be taken for 2 hours before or 2 hours after a dose (see section 4.4, Table 5). 
PALFORZIA should not be taken within 2 hours of bedtime.

Hypersensitivity to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
PALFORZIA is not intended for, and does not provide, immediate relief of allergic symptoms. 
Therefore, this medicinal product is not to be used for emergency treatment of allergic reactions, 
including anaphylaxis. 
Patients should not have active wheezing, uncontrolled severe atopic disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis or 
eczema), a flare of atopic disease or suspected intercurrent illness prior to initiation of therapy. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Adrenaline 
Self-injectable adrenaline must be prescribed to patients receiving this medicinal product. Patients 
must be instructed to carry self-injectable adrenaline at all times. Patients and caregivers must be 
instructed to recognise the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction and in the proper use of self-
injectable adrenaline. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care upon its use and to 
stop treatment until they have been evaluated by a physician. 
PALFORZIA may not be suitable for patients who are taking medications that can inhibit or potentiate 
the effect of adrenaline (see the SmPC of adrenaline for further information). 
Systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis 
When treated with PALFORZIA, peanut-allergic patients are exposed to peanut allergens that cause 
allergic symptoms. Therefore, allergic reactions to this medicinal product are expected in these 
patients. These reactions mostly occur during the first 2 hours after ingestion of the dose and are 
usually mild or moderate; however, more severe reactions may occur. Patients aged 12 years or older 
and/or with high sensitivity to peanut may be at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during 
treatment. 
Dose modifications should be considered for patients who experience moderate or severe adverse 
allergic reactions to PALFORZIA. For dose modification instructions, see section 4.2. 
PALFORZIA can cause systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, which may be life-
threatening.  
Severe adverse reactions such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, changes in voice or 
feeling of fullness in the throat, dizziness or fainting, severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, or severe flushing or itching of the skin require immediate treatment, including use of 
adrenaline and subsequent medical evaluation. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients must be educated to recognise the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions. Patients and 
caregivers should be instructed to contact a health care professional before administering the next dose 
of PALFORZIA if symptoms of an escalating or persistent allergic reaction occur. Any reaction must 
be treated promptly (e.g., with self-administration of intramuscular adrenaline) in case a severe 
adverse reaction develops and immediate medical attention should be sought directly afterwards. In 
the emergency department, treatment should follow the anaphylaxis guidelines. 
Patients may be more likely to experience allergy symptoms after dosing of PALFORZIA in the 
presence of a medical event such as an intercurrent illness (e.g., viral infection), exacerbation of 
asthma, or in the presence of other co-factors (e.g., exercise, menstruation, stress, fatigue, sleep 
deprivation, fasting, intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol). Patients should be 
counselled proactively about the potential for the increased risk of anaphylaxis in the presence of these 
co-factors, which may be modifiable or non-modifiable. On an individual basis and when needed, the 
time of dosing should be adjusted to avoid modifiable cofactors. If it is not possible to avoid any of the 
modifiable cofactors or if affected by non-modifiable co-factors, withholding or decreasing the 
PALFORZIA dose temporarily should be considered. Table 5 provides guidance on recommended 
actions to mitigate the risks associated with co-factors whilst on treatment.

Desensitisation response 
Recommended action to be taken 
Hot showers or baths should be avoided immediately prior to or 
following 3 hours of treatment. 
Exercise should be avoided immediately prior to or for 3 hours 
following treatment. 
After strenuous exercise signs of a hypermetabolic state 
(e.g., flushing, sweating, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate) must 
have subsided before taking a dose. 
Each dose should be consumed with a meal. 
Alcohol should not be taken for 2 hours before or 2 hours after 
a dose. 
The potential for allergic reactions to occur if taking non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines whilst on PALFORZIA 
treatment should be considered.  
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice before 
taking their next dose of PALFORZIA. 
Withholding or decreasing the PALFORZIA dose temporarily 
should be considered based on individual patient needs. 
Strict daily, long-term dosing in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet is required to achieve 
desensitisation and maintain the treatment effect of PALFORZIA. Treatment interruptions, including 
non-daily dosing, may potentially lead to an increased risk of allergic reactions or even anaphylaxis. 
As with any immunotherapy treatment, clinically meaningful desensitisation may not occur in all 
patients (see section 5.1). 
Asthma 
In patients with asthma, treatment may only be initiated when the asthma status is controlled. 
Treatment should be temporarily withheld if the patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. 
Following resolution of the exacerbation, resumption of PALFORZIA should be undertaken 
cautiously. Patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations should be re-evaluated and 
discontinuation considered. This medicinal product has not been studied in patients on long-term 
systemic corticosteroid therapy. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant illnesses 
This medicinal product may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may 
reduce the ability to survive a severe allergic reaction or increase the risk of adverse reactions after 
adrenaline administration. Examples of these medical conditions include, but are not limited to, 
markedly compromised lung function (chronic or acute; e.g., severe cystic fibrosis), unstable angina, 
recent myocardial infarction, significant arrhythmias, cyanotic congenital heart disease, uncontrolled 
hypertension, and inherited metabolic disorders. 
Gastro-intestinal adverse reactions including eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) 
If patients develop chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, dose modification may be 
considered (see section 4.2). EoE has been reported in association with PALFORZIA (see section 4.8). 
For chronic/recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting, dysphagia), the potential for a diagnosis of EoE should be considered. In patients who 
experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, gastroesophageal 
reflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain, treatment must be discontinued and a diagnosis of EoE should 
be considered. 
Concomitant allergen immunotherapy 
This medicinal product has not been studied in patients receiving concomitant allergen 
immunotherapy. Caution should be exercised when administering this medicinal product in 
conjunction with other allergen immunotherapies as the potential for severe allergic reactions may be 
enhanced.  
Oral inflammation or wounds 
Patients with acute severe inflammation of the mouth or oesophagus, or with oral wounds may be at 
greater risk of severe systemic allergic reactions following ingestion of peanut protein. Initiation of 
treatment should be postponed in these patients and ongoing treatment should be temporarily 
interrupted to allow healing of the oral cavity. 
Chronic urticaria 
Chronic urticaria, especially in the presence of severe exacerbations may confound the safety 
assessment of treatment. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Interactions with other medicinal products are not 
expected. 
Severe allergic reactions may be treated with adrenaline (see section 4.4). Please refer to the SmPC for 
adrenaline for further information on medicines that may potentiate or inhibit the effects of adrenaline. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) in pregnant women. 
Initiation of treatment with PALFORZIA is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Treatment with this medicinal product may cause anaphylaxis, which is a risk to pregnant women. 
Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in compromised 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placental perfusion and significant risk to a foetus during pregnancy. In addition, the effect of oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) on the immune system of the mother and foetus during pregnancy is unknown. 
For patients who are established on OIT and become pregnant, the benefits of remaining on OIT and 
retaining desensitisation should be weighed against the risks of an anaphylactic reaction while 
remaining on OIT. 
Breast-feeding 
Peanut allergens have been found in human milk after consumption of peanuts. There are no data 
available on the effects of PALFORZIA on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The 
developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother’s 
clinical need for treatment and any other potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from 
PALFORZIA or from the underlying maternal condition. 
Fertility 
There are no specific clinical or nonclinical data on the effects of defatted powder of Arachis 
hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
PALFORZIA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be 
exercised for 2 hours after dosing in case any symptoms of an allergic reaction occur that could impact 
the ability to drive or use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (of any severity) are abdominal pain (49.4%), throat irritation 
(40.7%), pruritus (33.7%), nausea (33.2%), vomiting (28.5%), urticaria (28.5%), oral pruritus (26.0%), 
abdominal discomfort (22.9%), and abdominal pain upper (22.8%).  
The incidence of adverse reactions was higher during up-dosing (85.7%) than initial dose escalation 
(45.1%) and maintenance (57.7%).  
The median time from administration of PALFORZIA in a clinical setting to onset of the first 
symptom ranged from 4 to 8 minutes. The median time from onset of the first symptom to resolution 
of the last symptom ranged from 15 to 30 minutes. 
10.5% of subjects discontinued study product due to 1 or more adverse reactions. The most common 
adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment were abdominal pain (3.8%), vomiting 
(2.5%), nausea (1.9%), and systemic allergic reaction (1.6%), including anaphylaxis. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 6 is based on data from clinical trials. Listed adverse reactions are divided into groups according 
to the MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: Very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000), and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Systemic allergic reactions (Anaphylactic reactions)  
For the purpose of reporting the clinical study results, the term systemic allergic reaction is used to 
describe anaphylactic reaction events of any severity and the term anaphylaxis is used to distinguish 
anaphylactic reaction events that were severe. 
Systemic allergic reactions of any severity were reported in 15.1% of subjects, including 0.6% during 
initial dose escalation, 8.7% during up-dosing, and 9.9% during maintenance. The majority of subjects 
who had systemic allergic reactions had reactions of mild or moderate severity. Severe systemic 
allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) was reported in 10 subjects (1.1% overall), including 4 subjects (0.4%) 
during up-dosing and 6 (0.8%) during maintenance at 300 mg/day. 1.6% discontinued due to systemic 
allergic reaction including 0.3% with anaphylaxis. Of the total population, 10.6% of subjects reported 
a single episode of systemic allergic reaction and 4.6% reported two or more systemic allergic 
reactions. Existing data suggest an increased risk of systemic allergic reaction for adolescents (21.9%) 
than for children (≤ 11 years; 11.9%). 
In the clinical trials, the most commonly reported symptoms of systemic allergic reactions included 
skin disorders (urticaria, flushing, pruritis, face swelling, rash), respiratory disorders (dyspnea, 
wheezing, cough, throat tightness, rhinorrhea, throat irritation), and gastrointestinal disorders 
(abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting). The onset of most (87.0%) episodes of systemic allergic reaction 
was within 2 hours of the administration of the medication. 
Adrenaline use 
In the PALFORZIA safety population, 14.9% of subjects reported at least one episode of adrenaline 
use for any reason. 1.8% of patients reported at least one episode during initial dose escalation, 
9.1% during up-dosing, and 8.7% during maintenance. Of subjects who reported adrenaline usage, 
91.6% subjects required a single dose and 92.5% of adrenaline usage was for events of mild to 
moderate severity. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) 
In clinical trials, 12 out of 1,217 subjects were diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed eosinophilic 
oesophagitis while receiving PALFORZIA compared with 0 of 443 subjects receiving placebo. After 
discontinuation of PALFORZIA, symptomatic improvement was reported in 12 of 12 subjects. In 
8 subjects with available follow-up biopsy results, eosinophilic oesophagitis was resolved in 6 subjects 
and improved in 2 subjects.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Administration of PALFORZIA at greater than recommended doses in peanut-allergic patients 
increases the risk of side effects, including the risk of systemic allergic reactions or severe 
single-organ allergic reactions. In the event of anaphylaxis at home, patients should self-administer 
intramuscular adrenaline and follow-up with an emergency medical evaluation. In an emergency 
department, the anaphylaxis guidelines should be followed.

In the ARTEMIS study, the geometric mean (SD) peanut specific IgE of the PALFORZIA group was 
30.55 (7.794) kUA/L at the screening double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), 
increasing to 44.28 (10.850) kUA/L at the end of Up-Dosing, thereafter decreasing to 
28.92 (9.908) kUA/L at the exit DBPCFC (following 3 months of PALFORZIA maintenance dosing 
at 300 mg daily). The geometric LS (least squares) mean ratio (exit/screening) was 1.18, 
95% confidence interval (CI) (0.97, 1.44). 
Immunologic parameters in long-term maintenance 
The sustained effects of PALFORZIA treatment on the immunologic parameters peanut-specific IgE, 
IgG4 and the IgE/IgG4 ratio for subjects who completed 12 and 18 months of PALFORZIA

Clinical efficacy 
In all PALFORZIA clinical studies, efficacy was measured using a DBPCFC. This food challenge was 
performed according to the Practical Allergy (PRACTALL) guidelines with modification to include a 
600 mg protein dose (between the 300 mg and 1,000 mg challenge doses). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of PALFORZIA was assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre, phase 3 pivotal studies PALISADE and ARTEMIS. Both studies recruited subjects with 
a documented history of peanut allergy. Subjects with a severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis event 
within 60 days of study entry and those with severe or uncontrolled asthma were excluded from the 
studies. After an initial dose escalation ranging from 0.5 mg to 6 mg on day 1 and confirmation of 
tolerability of the 3 mg dose on day 2, subjects underwent up-dosing for 20 to 40 weeks starting at 
3 mg until the 300 mg dose was reached. The Up-Dosing period varied for each subject depending on 
doses tolerated. Subjects then underwent 6 months (PALISADE) or 3 months (ARTEMIS) of 
maintenance immunotherapy with 300 mg PALFORZIA or placebo until the end of the study when 
subjects completed an exit DBPCFC to assess desensitisation to peanut. 
PALISADE recruited subjects aged 4 to 55 years in Europe and North America. A total of 
750 subjects aged 4 to 17 years were screened and 499 were randomly assigned (3:1) to study 
treatment (374 to PALFORZIA and 125 to placebo). The primary efficacy analysis population 
consisted of 496 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who received at least one dose of study treatment. In this 
study, eligible subjects were those sensitive to ≤ 100 mg of peanut protein at the screening DBPCFC. 
Of the subjects treated with PALFORZIA in the primary analysis population, 72% had a medical 
history of allergic rhinitis, 66% reported multiple food allergies, 63% had a medical history of atopic 
dermatitis, and 53% had a present or previous diagnosis of asthma. The median age of subjects was 
9 years. More than half of the subjects were male (56%) and most subjects were white (78%).  
ARTEMIS recruited subjects aged 4 to 17 years of age in Europe. A total of 175 subjects aged 
4 to 17 years were randomly assigned (3:1) to study treatment (132 to PALFORZIA and 43 to 
placebo). The primary efficacy analysis population consisted of 175 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who 
received at least one dose of study treatment. In this study, eligible subjects were those sensitive to 
≤ 300 mg of peanut protein at the screening DBPCFC. Of the subjects treated with PALFORZIA in 
the primary analysis group, 61% reported multiple food allergies, 59% had a medical history of atopic 
dermatitis, 48% had a medical history of allergic rhinitis, and 42% had a present or previous diagnosis 
of asthma. The median age of subjects was 8.0 years. More than half of the subjects were male (52%) 
and most subjects were white (82%).  
Efficacy data 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both PALISADE and ARTEMIS was the proportion of subjects aged 
4 to 17 years who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1,000 mg peanut protein with no more than 
mild allergic symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (desensitisation response rate). Key secondary endpoints 
in this age group included determination of the desensitisation response rates after single doses of 
300 mg and 600 mg peanut protein and the maximum severity of symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. 
Desensitisation response rates 
The summary of desensitisation response rates for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the 
intention to treat (ITT) population in both PALISADE and ARTEMIS are provided in Table 9. 
Subjects without an exit DBPCFC were counted as non-responders.

Response rates in subjects who turned 18 years during therapy 
The response rate of PALFORZIA treated subjects who turned 18 years whilst participating in a study 
and tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1,000 mg peanut protein with no more than mild allergic 
symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (15/27, 55.6%) was consistent with the overall primary efficacy of the 
subjects aged 4 to 17 years. 
Sustained efficacy 
Sustained efficacy has been demonstrated in 104 subjects and 26 subjects who completed 12 and 
18 months of PALFORZIA maintenance treatment with the ongoing therapeutic dose (300 mg daily) 
through participation in both PALISADE and the open-label, follow-on ARC004 study. A comparison 
of response rates after longer-term maintenance therapy with PALFORZIA can be made by comparing 
the response rates for the 12-month and 18-month maintenance cohorts in ARC004 with those who 
completed PALISADE (see Table 10).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
No clinical studies investigating the pharmacokinetic profile and metabolism of PALFORZIA have 
been conducted. PALFORZIA contains naturally occurring allergenic peanut proteins. After oral 
administration, the proteins are hydrolysed to amino acids and small polypeptides in the lumen of the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical studies with defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) have not been 
conducted.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PALFORZIA is and what it is used for 
PALFORZIA contains peanut protein from defatted powder of peanut seed. It belongs to a class of 
medicines called food allergens. It is a treatment for people who are allergic to peanuts (Arachis 
hypogaea L.).  
PALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged from 4 to 17 years and those who 
become adults whilst on treatment. 
PALFORZIA works in people with peanut allergy by gradually increasing the body’s ability to 
tolerate small amounts of peanut (desensitisation). PALFORZIA can help reduce the severity of 
allergic reactions after coming into contact with peanut. 
PALFORZIA is not effective against any other nut or food allergies. 
You must continue to strictly avoid eating peanuts while taking PALFORZIA. 
2.  What you need to know before you take PALFORZIA 
Do not take PALFORZIA 
- 
if you are allergic to any of the excipients (other ingredients) in this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have severe asthma or if your asthma is not under control (as assessed by a doctor). 
if you have ever had a problem swallowing or long term problems with your digestive system. 
if you have ever had a severe mast cell disorder (as assessed by a doctor). 
if you had severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis within 60 days before starting treatment. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking PALFORZIA and tell your doctor about any medical conditions that 
you have. 
You must not take any peanut or peanut containing food in your diet whilst taking PALFORZIA. 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your PALFORZIA. So, every time you get a 
new package of PALFORZIA, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
PALFORZIA does not treat the symptoms of peanut allergy and you must not take 
PALFORZIA during an allergic reaction. 
Your doctor will advise the best time to start treatment depending on any medical conditions that you 
have.  
PALFORZIA contains the substance that patients with peanut allergy react to. Allergic reactions to 
PALFORZIA may occur during treatment. These reactions mostly occur during the first two hours 
after taking a PALFORZIA dose and are usually mild or moderate but ocasionally can be severe. 
Stop taking PALFORZIA and get medical treatment straight away if you have any of the following 
symptoms: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Trouble breathing 
Throat tightness or feeling of fulness in throat  
Trouble swallowing 
Change in voice  
Dizziness or fainting or feeling of impending doom 
Severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting or diarrhoea 
Severe flushing or itching of the skin 
Worsening of asthma or of any other breathing condition 
Heartburn, difficult swallowing, pain with swallowing, stomach pain or chest pain that does 
not go away or worsens 
Certain conditions or factors can increase the likelihood of an allergic reaction. These include: 
- 
- 
Worsening of asthma 
Having an open sore or other damage to the lining of the mouth or the passage leading from the 
mouth to the stomach (oesophagus) 
Exercising 
Having a hot bath or shower 
Being very tired or missing sleep 
For women, having your period  
Taking certain pain medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen 
Drinking alcohol 
Being stressed 
Taking PALFORZIA on an empty stomach 
Having an illness such as a cold or flu or other viral infections 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
There are actions you should take to avoid some of these factors from affecting you. These factors 
include: exercise, having a hot bath or shower, drinking alcohol, or taking this medicine on an empty 
stomach. See the sections on ‘PALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol’ and ‘Dosing instructions’ 
for advice on what to do about these. 
64 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For all other conditions or factors listed above, contact your doctor for advice if you experience 
allergic reactions during any of these. 
Your doctor will prescribe adrenaline for you to self-inject, which you must have with you at all times 
in case you have a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor will tell you how to recognise an allergic 
reaction and teach you when and how to use the adrenaline. Talk to your doctor and read the 
adrenaline package leaflet if you have any questions about its use. 
If you use adrenaline, do not take any further doses of PALFORZIA and seek emergency medical care 
immediately afterwards. 
Desensitisation to peanut with PALFORZIA takes time. The ability to tolerate gradually increasing 
small amounts of peanut has been shown after completion of all up-dosing levels of PALFORZIA and 
after at least 3 months of maintenance therapy and this continues to improve over time. 
You must take PALFORZIA every day to maintain the desensitisation it provides. Missing any doses 
can lead to an increased risk of allergic reactions. 
PALFORZIA treatment may not work in all patients. 
Children and adolescents 
PALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged 4 to 17 years and those who become 
adults whilst on treatment. 
Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 4 years because it is not known if PALFORZIA is 
safe and effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and PALFORZIA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. 
PALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol 
PALFORZIA should not be mixed with liquid (e.g., water, milk, juice, soup, smoothie). 
Do not drink alcohol 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking PALFORZIA as this may increase the 
likelihood of an allergic reaction.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Do not start treatment with PALFORZIA if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
PALFORZIA may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or operate machinery. Exercise 
caution for 2 hours after taking a dose of PALFORZIA in case you have an allergic reaction which 
affects your ability to drive, cycle, or use machinery. Wait until all symptoms of such allergic 
reactions have gone away before driving, cycling, or using machinery.

3. 
How to take PALFORZIA 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
PALFORZIA is prescribed by doctors who are experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of allergy 
and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. 
How should I take PALFORZIA? 
Dosing 
There are 3 phases of treatment with PALFORZIA: initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and 
maintenance. You must complete these treatment phases in the order that your doctor has prescribed. 
During the initial dose escalation and up-dosing phases, the dose of PALFORZIA is increased in a 
precise way. During the maintenance phase, you take the same dose of PALFORZIA each day. 
You should take PALFORZIA every day to maintain your level of desensitisation to peanuts. 
Tell your doctor on the day of each clinic visit if you are feeling unwell or if you feel your asthma is 
less controlled. 
Initial dose escalation 
You will be treated with the first doses (initial dose escalation) of PALFORZIA over about 4 to 
5 hours in your doctor’s clinic. On the first day you will be treated with 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 
and 6 mg of PALFORZIA. 
Up-dosing 
If you tolerate the initial dose-escalation phase, you will be asked to return to your doctor’s clinic on 
another day (usually the next day) to start the up-dosing phase. 
There are 11 different dose levels of up-dosing, starting with PALFORZIA 3 mg (level 1) and 
increasing to PALFORZIA 300 mg (level 11). 
The up-dosing levels are shown in the table below:

The first dose of each up-dosing level is given to you by your doctor in a clinic. If you tolerate the first 
dose of a new dose level, your doctor will ask you to continue to take that dose every day at home for 
about 2 weeks. 
During the up-dosing phase, your doctor will see you about every 2 weeks to assess you for a new up-
dosing level. 
You must have completed all 11 up-dosing levels before you can start maintenance treatment. It will 
take at least 22 weeks to complete all up-dosing levels. 
Maintenance dosing 
If you are able tolerate level 11 of the up-dosing phase, your doctor will ask you to continue taking 
PALFORZIA at a 300 mg dose every day as maintenance therapy. 
Preparation for use 
PALFORZIA is available either in capsules or sachets. Empty the powder from PALFORZIA capsules 
or sachets.  
Do not swallow PALFORZIA capsules. 
Open the daily dose of PALFORZIA. 
- 
To open a capsule gently pull the two ends of the capsule apart over a bowl with soft food and 
empty the powder into the bowl by rolling each half of the capsule between the finger and 
thumb. Tap the ends of each half capsule to make sure that all the powder is emptied. 
To open a sachet carefully cut or tear along the top along the line indicated. Tip the sachet 
upside down over a bowl with soft food and tap the sachet to make sure that all the powder is 
emptied. 
- 
Empty the full dose of PALFORZIA oral powder on to a small amount of soft food to which you are 
not allergic such as fruit puree, yogurt, or rice-pudding. Make sure you are not allergic to the food 
used for mixing. 
The food used for mixing should be cool and no warmer than room temperature. 
Mix well. 
Use just enough food to mix with PALFORZIA so you can eat it all in a few spoonfuls to take the full 
dose. 
Take PALFORZIA immediately after mixing. However, if needed, you can mix PALFORZIA with 
food and keep it in a refrigerator for up to 8 hours before taking. If it is not used within 8 hours, throw 
it away and prepare a new dose. 
Handling instructions 
Do not breathe in PALFORZIA powder as this could cause breathing problems (worsening of asthma) 
or cause an allergic reaction. 
Wash your hands immediately after handling PALFORZIA capsules or sachets. 
When your doctor has told you that an up-dosing level is complete, you must dispose of all remaining 
capsules or sachets from that pack (see section 5) before starting on a new level. This includes any 
extra doses that are provided in each pack, if not used.

Dosing instructions 
Take PALFORZIA at about the same time every day with food, preferably as part of your evening 
meal. Do not take this medicine on an empty stomach. 
Do not take PALFORZIA at home on the days that you visit your doctor for assessment as your doctor 
will give you PALFORZIA on these days. 
Children should be given each dose of PALFORZIA by an adult and they should be watched for about 
1 hour afterwards for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
Do not take within 2 hours of bedtime. 
Do not have a hot bath or shower just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. 
Do not exercise just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. 
If you have been exercising or have taken a hot bath or shower and are feeling hot, or you are sweating 
and your heart is beating fast, do not take PALFORZIA until you have cooled down and your heart 
rate (pulse) has returned to normal. 
Do not take more than your individual total daily dose according to your current dose level of 
PALFORZIA in a single day. 
If you take more PALFORZIA than you should 
Taking PALFORZIA at doses more than those recommended increases the risk of allergic reactions. 
In the case of severe reactions such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, changes in your 
voice, or a feeling of fullness in the throat, treat the reaction with adrenaline self-injector as instructed 
by your doctor and then contact a doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take PALFORZIA 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Missed doses of PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and 
increase your risk of allergic reactions. 
If you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 1 to 2 days in a row, take the next dose at your normal 
scheduled time the next day. 
If you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 3 days in a row or longer, stop taking PALFORZIA and 
contact your doctor for advice on how to start your treatment again. 
If you stop taking PALFORZIA 
Stopping PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and increase 
your risk of allergic reactions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

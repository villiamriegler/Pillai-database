Brief description of the 
product
SIMPONI®
Centralized
Chemical class
Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to 
human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Golimumab is an 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 (G1m[z] allotype) mAb with a 
molecular weight of approximately 150,000 Daltons.
Summary of mode of action
Golimumab forms high affinity, stable complexes with both the 
soluble and transmembrane forms of human TNFα and 
consequently prevents the binding of TNFα to its receptors. 
Golimumab neutralizes TNF-induced expression of cell-surface 
adhesion proteins and secretion of cytokines and chemokines by 
human endothelial cells.
Important information about its composition
Golimumab was derived by immunizing mice that were 
transgenic for part of the human Ig repertoire with human TNFα 
and applying conventional cell fusion technology to generate a 
hybridoma cell line that secreted a human mAb termed TNV148. 
The complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules 
encoding the TNV148 mAb heavy chain and light chain variable 
regions were cloned from the hybridoma cells and combined with 
coding sequences for human heavy chain (IgG1 isotype, G1m[z] 
allotype) and human light chain (kappa isotype) constant regions. 
Transfected cells secreting large amounts of the recombinant 
version of the mAb, designated golimumab, were identified by 
extensive screening of supernatants from cell cultures followed 
by subcloning to identify stably producing, homogeneous cell 
lines.

Rheumatoid arthritis
SIMPONI, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is 
indicated for:


The treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in adults when the response to disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy,
including MTX, has been inadequate.
The treatment of severe, active, and progressive RA in 
adults not previously treated with MTX.
SIMPONI, in combination with MTX, has been shown to reduce 
the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by x-ray and 
to improve physical function.
Psoriatic arthritis
SIMPONI, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for:

The treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous 
DMARD therapy has been inadequate.
SIMPONI has also been shown to reduce the rate of progression 
of peripheral joint damage as measured by x-ray in patients with 
polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease and to improve 
physical function.
Ankylosing spondylitis
SIMPONI is indicated for the treatment of severe, active 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults who have responded 
inadequately to conventional therapy.
Ulcerative colitis
SIMPONI is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine or who are 
intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.
Nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis
SIMPONI is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe, 
active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) (AxSpA)
(nr-AxSpA) with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by 
elevated C-reactive protein and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
evidence, who have had an inadequate response to, or are 
intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis:
SIMPONI, in combination with MTX, is indicated for the 
treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)
(pJIA) in children 2 years of age or older who have responded 
inadequately to previous therapy with MTX.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Indication: Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Incidence: 
The  incidence  of  RA  varies  by  country.  The  median  annual  incidence  observed  in  south 
European countries was 16.5 cases per 100,000 persons (Alamanos 2006). For north European 
countries the median annual incidence observed was 29, and for North American countries, 38 
(Alamanos 2006). In Sweden, Eriksson et al studied the Swedish National Patient Register for 
patients diagnosed with RA between 2006 and 2008; the overall incidence of RA was 41 per 
100,000 persons (56 for women and 25 for men) (Eriksson 2013). An Italian study estimated 
the annual incidence of RA for that country to be 35 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 29-42) (Rossini 2014). A study in the United Kingdom (UK) using the Clinical 
Practice  Research  Datalink,  a  database  of  longitudinal  medical  records  from  primary  care, 
reported  an  incidence  of  3.81  (95%  CI:  3.61-4.02)  per  10,000 person-years  in  2014 
(Abhishek 2017).
In  the  United  States  (US),  a  study  in  Olmsted  County,  Minnesota,  included  RA  data  from 
1995 to 2007 for residents 18 or older. Similar to the Swedish study, the overall age- and sex-
residents  was  40.9  per  100,000  population 
adjusted  annual 
(Myasoedova 2010).
incidence  among 
Prevalence:
The  overall  world  prevalence  of  RA  is  approximately  0.5%  to  1%  (Gibofsky 2012).  A 
population survey for the prevalence of rheumatic diseases in adults was conducted in central 
Greece.  Of  1,705  individuals  that  responded  to  the  questionnaire,  420  (24.6%)  reported 
rheumatic disease and diagnoses were confirmed by a rheumatologist. In this population, the 
prevalence of RA was 0.58% (95% CI: 0.32%-0.87%) (Anagnostopoulos 2010). 
In  the  UK,  RA  is  the  second  most  common  form of  arthritis  and  the  most  common 
inflammatory  joint  disorder.  Estimated  number  of  cases  of  RA  in  the  UK  are  listed  below 
(Arthritis Research UK. Rheumatoid Arthritis 2013).

In the aforementioned study by Myasoedova et al in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the overall 
age- and sex- adjusted prevalence of RA among individuals who were 18 years of age or older 
on 01 January 2005 was 0.72%, which represents an increase from the estimates of 0.62% on 
01 January 1995 (Myasoedova 2010). When the prevalence of RA on 01 January 2005 was 
applied to the US population in 2005, it showed that an estimated 1.5 million US adults were 
affected by RA.
9
Demographics of the Population in the RA Indication (Age and Sex) and Risk Factors 
for the Disease: 
Globally, the age-standardized prevalence rate of RA was higher in women and increased with 
age, peaking at 70 to 74 years among women and 75 to 79 years among men in 2017. Although 
the onset of RA may occur at any time from early adulthood to advanced old age, the number 
of incident cases reaches its highest level at 50 to 54 years, followed by a declining trend from 
55 years onwards (Safiri 2019).
Women are approximately 3 times more likely to develop RA than men (Lipsky 2008). In the 
Swedish  study  by  Eriksson et al,  women had  a  higher  incidence  rate  in  all  age  categories 
compared  with men,  though  the  difference  decreased  with  age  (Eriksson 2013). In  the 
previously described prevalence study in Greece, female to male ratio with RA was defined as 
2.3:1 (Anagnostopoulos 2010). In the UK, incidence and prevalence rates appear to be higher 
for females in all age groups with the exception of the incidence rate in 75-and-over age group 
(Arthritis Research UK. Rheumatoid Arthritis 2013). A US study reported that the age adjusted 
prevalence  of  RA  in  adults  ranged  from  0.29%  to  0.31%  for  men and  0.73%  to  0.78%  for 
women (Hunter 2017).
Risk Factors
Genetics
Twin  and  family  studies  suggest  that  the  risk  of  disease  among  relatives  of  individuals  is 
influenced by shared genetic factors. Studies carried out in Caucasian patients with established 
and advanced disease indicated an association of RA with alleles encoding a “shared epitope” 
(called  “rheumatoid  epitope”).  These  studies  also  suggested  a  significant  association  of 
“rheumatoid epitope” with disease severity and outcome (Alamanos 2006).
There  is  long-standing  evidence  that  specific  human  leucocyte  antigen  (HLA)  class  II 
genotypes are associated with an increased risk of RA. Most attention has been given to the 
DR4 and DRB1 molecules of the major histocompatibility complex HLA class II genes. The 
strongest  associations  have  been  found  between  RA  and  the  DRB1*0401  and  DRB1*0404 
alleles. Investigations indicate that of the more than 30 genes studied, the strongest candidate 
gene is PTPN22, a gene that has been linked to several autoimmune conditions (Hinks 2005). 
Smoking 
A history of smoking is associated with a modest to moderate (1.2 to 2.4 times) increased risk 
of RA onset (Silman 2001). This relationship between smoking and RA  is strongest among 
people  who  are  anti-citrullinated  protein/peptide  antibodies-positive, which  is  a  marker  of 
autoimmune activity (Scott 2010). The association also appears to be dose-dependent and is 
most clear for heavy smokers. The severity and outcome of RA appears also to be influenced 
by smoking, although it is not clear which clinical characteristics of the disease are related to 
smoking  (Alamanos 2005).  There  is  a  prolonged  increased  risk  even  after  cessation 
(Carmona 2010).
Reproductive and Breastfeeding History
Most  studies  have  found  that  women who  have  never  had  a  live  birth  have  a  slight  to 
moderately increased risk of RA. Recent population-based studies have also found that RA is 
10
less common among women who breastfeed. At least 2 studies have observed that women with 
irregular menses or a truncated menstrual history (eg, early menopause) have an increased risk 
of RA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC: Arthritis). A significantly increased 
risk  of  RA  has  been  demonstrated  in  women whose  pregnancies  were  complicated  by 
hyperemesis, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia (Carmona 2010).
Infectious Agents 
It  is  possible  that  infectious  agents  could  trigger  the  development  of  RA  in  a  genetically 
susceptible  host.  Several  potential  associations  of  RA  with  infectious  agents  have  been 
suggested.  They  include  parvovirus,  rubella  virus,  Epstein-Barr  virus,  Borrelia  burgdorferi, 
and  others.  The  role  of  infectious  agents  in  the  occurrence  of  the  disease  remains  unclear 
(Alamanos 2005). Some bacteria such as Proteus and Mycoplasma also show an increased risk 
of RA (Carmona 2010).
Age
People  aged between  40  and  60  years are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  RA (Mayo  Clinic.
Rheumatoid arthritis: symptoms & causes).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Rheumatoid arthritis usually requires lifelong treatment, including pharmacologic intervention, 
physical therapy, exercise, education, and possible surgery. Early aggressive treatment of RA 
can delay joint destruction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, DMARDs, 
antimalarial medications, several anti-TNFα agents, and other biologics (including white blood 
cell modulators and interleukin [IL]-6 inhibitors) are used in the pharmacologic management 
of  RA.  Other  approaches  used  for  the  treatment  of  RA  include  inhibition  of  Janus  kinases
(Mayo Clinic. Rheumatoid arthritis: diagnosis & treatment).
Natural History of RA in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and Morbidity:
As patients with RA are invariably treated, it is no longer possible to differentiate the effects 
of  treatment  from  the  natural  history  of  the  disease  (Scott 2007).  The  natural  disease 
progression  of  RA  results  in  persistent  joint  inflammation,  progressive  joint  damage,  and 
continuing functional decline (Scott 2010). As the disease progresses, cartilage and bone within 
the  joint  become  damaged  and  surrounding  muscles,  ligaments  and  tendons  become  weak 
(National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, 2017). Some patients 
with  RA  experience  periods  of  disease  flare  and  periods  of  remission  (National  Institute  of 
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, 2017). A study conducted in Sweden reported 
that, at baseline, about 95% of RA patients fell into the moderate or severe category and over 
a period of 3 years of receiving appropriate physician directed care, these proportions changed 
such that about 25% met the criteria for remission, 10% had low activity, 50% had moderate 
activity, and about 15% had high activity (Hallert 2006). 
Patients  with  RA  have  about  a  50%  increased  risk  of  premature  mortality,  and  their  life 
expectancy  is  decreased  by  3  to  10  years  compared  with  the  general  population 
(Myasoedova 2010).
In  2019,  the  global  mortality  rate  for  RA  was  estimated  to  be  0.57  deaths  per 
100,000 population  (0.44  to  0.67)  (Institute  for  Health  Metrics  Evaluation  2020).  A  meta-
11
analysis by Dadoun et al found a pooled incident mortality rate (IMR) in RA of 2.7 per 100 
person-years  (95%  CI: 2.2-3.3)  (Dadoun 2013). The  rates  ranged  from  1.0 per 100 person-
years to 5.2 per 100 person-years. The analysis revealed a significant decrease in IMR over 
3 periods.  The  estimated  pooled  IMR  was  4.7  per  100  person-years  (95% CI:  4.0-5.4)  for 
studies  starting  before  1970,  3.0  per  100  person-years  (95%  CI: 2.3-4.0)  for  those  starting 
between 1970 and 1985; and 2.0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 1.3-2.8) for those starting after 
1985. Older age at diagnosis and longer length of follow-up were found to be significant factors 
for  higher  IMR.  The  mean  standardized mortality  ratio  (SMR)  for  8 studies  was  2.01 
(95% CI: 1.99-2.03). The Norfolk Arthritis Register in the UK reported that for patients who 
had been followed for 20 years, the age and sex SMR was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.11-1.42) and that 
older age at onset and male gender were associated with increased risk of death during that 
time period (Gwinnutt 2017). 
Important Comorbidities:
Comorbidities  that  occur  frequently  in  patients  with  RA  include  depression,  asthma, 
cardiovascular  events  (myocardial  infarction,  stroke),  solid  malignancies,  and  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (Dougados 2014).
12
Indication: Psoriatic Arthritis 
Incidence:
A  meta-analysis  of  28  studies  reported  a  pooled  incidence  of  8.3  per  100,000  person-years 
(95%  CI:  4.1-16.7)  (Scotti 2018).  A  meta-analysis  of  10  studies  reported  incidence  rates 
ranging  from  0.27  per  100  person-years  to  2.7  per  100  person-years  among  patients  with 
psoriasis (Alinaghi 2019).
Prevalence:
A meta-analysis of 28 studies reported a pooled prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%-0.16%) 
(Scotti 2018). Globally, the prevalence of PsA ranges from 0.04% to 1.2%, depending on the 
population  studied  (Gladman 2005a). A  systematic  review  of  10  studies  estimated  the 
prevalence of PsA in Europe to be 0.19% (95% CI: 0.16%-0.32%) (Stolwijk 2016). In a study 
conducted using Kaiser Permanente Northern California Data, the number of persons with one 
or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic codes for 
PsA  between  1996  and  2009  was  5,187,  corresponding  to  a  point  prevalence  of  12.6
(95% CI: 11.6-13.7) per 100,000 persons, standardized to the age and sex distribution of the 
2000 census on 31 December 2009 (Asagari 2013). A meta-analysis of 266 studies reported a 
pooled proportion of PsA among patients with psoriasis of 19.7% (95% CI: 18.5%-20.9%) with 
some estimates as high as 30% (Alinaghi 2019; Mease 2013).
A cross-sectional study using The Health Information Network (THIN) database from the UK 
found that among 4.8 million patients aged 18 to 90 years, between 1994 and 2010, a total of 
9,045 patients had at least 1 medical code for PsA, giving an overall prevalence of 0.19% (95% 
CI: 0.185-0.193). The prevalence by age and sex are reported in the table below (Ogdie 2013).

Demographics of the Population in the PsA Indication (Age and Sex) and Risk Factors 
for the Disease: 
Anyone can develop PsA but it occurs most often in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years 
(Mayo Clinic. Psoriatic arthritis: symptoms & causes).
Overall, men and women are affected by PsA with equal frequency, though the actual male: 
female  ratio  may  vary  depending  upon  the  subset  in  question.  The  demographic  profile  is 
probably consistent with that of psoriasis.
13
Risk Factors
Family History 
Many  people  with  PsA  have  a  parent  or  sibling  with  the  disease  (Mayo  Clinic.  Psoriatic 
arthritis: symptoms & causes). Studies have suggested that there is a high risk for PsA among 
first-degree relatives. Associations of HLA with PsA have been demonstrated particularly for 
class 1  alleles  at  the  B  and  C  loci.  In  addition  to  being  associated  with  the  disease,  HLA 
antigens have been identified as prognostic markers for the progression of clinical damage in 
PsA (Gladman 2009).
Psoriasis 
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with psoriasis eventually develop PsA (Ocampo 2019).
The  single  greatest  risk  factor  is  psoriasis  lesions  on  nails.  It  has  been  suggested  that  an 
infectious  agent  may  trigger  the  psoriatic  process,  and  the  immunological  response  seen  in 
patients  with  both  psoriasis  and PsA  may  be  the  result  of  mimicry  between  streptococcal 
antigens and epidermal autoantigens. The exacerbation of psoriasis and PsA seen in the context 
of  acquired  immunodeficiency  virus  infections  suggests  that  human  immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) may play a role (Gladman 2009).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
The treatment of PsA is similar to the treatment of RA and focuses on controlling inflammation 
in  the  affected  joints  to  prevent  joint  pain  and  disabilities.  Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory 
drugs,  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  DMARDs,  immunosuppressants,  several  anti-TNFα 
agents, and other biologics (including IL-12/23 inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors) are used in the 
pharmacologic management of PsA (Mayo Clinic. Psoriatic arthritis: diagnosis & treatment). 
Natural History of PsA in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity:
Because observational studies generally include a treated population, it is difficult to describe 
the course of the disease in the untreated population and to differentiate the effects of treatment 
from the natural history  of the disease. Spondylitis (inflammation of  the vertebra) has  been 
reported  to  be  present  in  40%  of  PsA  patients,  and  87%  have  psoriatic  lesions  of  the  nails
(Gladman 2005b).  As  the  disease progresses, 20%  of  patients  develop  a  very  destructive 
disabling  form  of  arthritis  and  47%  sustain  erosive  changes  after  2  years  of  disease 
(Gladman 2009). It has been reported that for patients who have been followed for more than 
10 years, 55% had 5 or more deformed joints (Gladman 2005b).
Patients who were entered into the PsA database at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic 
Diseases between 1985 and 2007 were included in a study to examine mortality of PsA patients. 
Of  453  patients  with  PsA  (232 men,  221  women),  37  deaths were  reported (16 men and 
21 women). The SMR was 67.78% for men (95% CI: 38.79-110.22) and 97.01% for women
(95% CI:

and depression (Haddad 2017).

Indication: AxSpA (including AS and nr-AxSpA)
Axial SpA is the term used for a classification of inflammatory rheumatic diseases that includes 
AS and nr-AxSpA. The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society introduced the 
classification of nr-AxSpA in 2009. Literature regarding the nr-AxSpA patient population is 
limited at this time. However, patients with nr-AxSpA are very similar to those with AS with 
the  exception  that  the  sacroiliac  joints  of  the  pelvis  have  little  to  no  changes  by  x-ray in 
nr-AxSpA. Many patients initially diagnosed as having nr-AxSpA or undifferentiated SpA may 
subsequently develop AS. Therefore, given the similar classification and the nature of these 
diseases,  the  epidemiology  information  is  presented  together  for  AS  and  nr-AxSpA  in  the 
following sections and where separate information is available, it is provided.
Incidence:
The  incidence  of  AS  is  reported  to  be  between  0.5  to  14  per  100,000 population  per  year 
(Jacobs 2008; Stolwijk 2012). Estimated rates of the incidence for AS vary significantly among 
populations. A study from Norway reported an annual incidence of AS between 1982 to 1993 
of 14.1 per year in the town of Tromsø compared with 5.2 per year in the surrounding rural
region (Bakland 2005). A study from Greece reported that incidence rates were higher in the 
age group 35 to 44 years for men and in the age group 25 to 34 years for women. A US study 
reported an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 2.5-3.8) 
in adults (Wright 2015).
Prevalence:
The prevalence of AS has been estimated to vary between 0.01% and 1.84% depending on the 
geographical region being studied (Healey 2011; Stolwijk 2012). A review of the prevalence 
of AS in Europe estimated the mean prevalence to be 23.8 per 10,000 population (Dean 2014). 
A US study of medical and pharmacy claims data reported a prevalence of 0.09% for adults in 
2016  (Walsh 2019).  In  Germany,  the  age-specific  prevalence  of  self-reported, doctor-
diagnosed AS in the general population was reported as follows: age 18 to 44 years, 0.6%; age 
45 to 64 years,  1.6%;  age  65  to  74  years,  1.9%;  age  75  to  79  years,  1.4%;  total  1.1% 
(Westhoff 2009). In Sweden, the point prevalence of AS in 2009 was estimated at 0.18% for 
the population aged between 16 and 64 years (Exarchou 2015).
A  US  study  that  examined  radiographs  obtained  from  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition 
Examination Survey I (NHANES I) provided prevalence estimates for sacroiliitis, an important 
component of the AS case definition. The prevalence of moderate to severe sacroiliitis was 
0.4% among men aged 25 to 34 years; 0.6% among men aged 65 to 74 years; and 0.4% among 
women aged 65 to 74 years (Dillon 2011).
One epidemiologic study has estimated the prevalence of AS and nr-AxSpA in the US to be 
0.35%  (95%  CI: 0.18%-0.554%)  and  0.35%  (95%  CI: 0.18%-0.554%),  respectively 
(Strand 2013).
Demographics of the Population in the AxSpA Indication (Age and Sex) and Risk 
Factors for the Disease: 
The symptoms of AxSpA are usually first observed in the late adolescence or early adulthood.
In a US study, the mean age at diagnosis was reported as 35 years, with a range of 19 to 69 years 
and a mean (±standard deviation) age of symptom onset of 28.7 (±9.2) years (Wright 2015). In 
16
an international, multicenter, observational study, the median age at onset of axial symptoms 
in patients with AxSpA was 26 years (IQR 20-34) (Boel 2022). The male: female ratio among 
patients  with  AS  is  approximately  3.8:1  (Dean 2014). The  male:  female ratio  has  been 
estimated to be 2:1 for radiographic AxSpA and 1:1 for nr-AxSpA (Sieper 2017). A multicenter
study of men and women in France with nr-AxSpA showed women with early nr-AxSpA had 
greater disease activity and worse functioning despite fewer radiologic abnormalities than men
(Tournadre 2013).
Risk Factors
The risk factors associated with AxSpA, including AS and nr-AxSpA, include being male, age 
(onset generally occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood), and having the HLA-B27 gene 
(Mayo Clinic. Ankylosing spondylitis: symptoms & causes). Baseline radiographic damage, 
elevated  acute-phase  reactant  levels,  and  cigarette  smoking  can  predict  future  radiographic 
damage in patients with early SpA (Slobodin 2015).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
The goal of treatment is to relieve pain and stiffness and prevent or delay complication and 
spinal deformity. Ankylosing spondylitis treatment is most successful before the disease causes 
irreversible damage to joints.
Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  several  anti-TNFα  agents  are  used  in  the 
pharmacologic  management  of  AS  and  nr-AxSpA (Mayo  Clinic. Ankylosing  spondylitis:
diagnosis  &  treatment;  Ward 2016).  In  addition,  inhibition  of  IL-17  has  been  shown  to  be 
effective  for  the  treatment  of  AS  (Mayo  Clinic.  Ankylosing  spondylitis:  diagnosis  & 
treatment).
Most people with AS or nr-AxSpA do not need surgery. However, it may be recommended if 
the patient has severe pain or joint damage, or if a hip joint is so damaged that is needs to be 
replaced.
Natural History of AxSpA in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity:
Since observational studies generally include a treated population, it is difficult to describe the 
course of AxSpA in the untreated population, and to differentiate the effects of treatment from 
the natural history of the disease. Many people with AS have mild, intermittent episodes of 
back pain. Symptoms can also be severe with ongoing pain accompanied by loss of flexibility 
of the spine. In the most severe cases, long-term inflammation leads to calcification that causes 
2 or more bones of the spine to fuse (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and 
Skin  Diseases,  2016).  In  the  European  population,  it  has  been  reported  that  42%  also  had 
peripheral  arthritis; enthesitis  was  present  in  38%  of  AS  patients,  and  uveitis  in  24% 
(Benegas 2012). In patients with severe involvement, which is approximately 33% of the AS 
population,  most  loss  of  function  and  damage  occurs  during  the  first  10 years  of  disease 
(Braun 2002).
17
For nr-AxSpA, many patients will progress to radiographic AxSpA or AS after years of disease. 
This radiographic progression can be seen in about 10% of patients over 2 years of follow-up 
on average and in up to 20% over 2  years among those with elevated C-reactive protein or 
active inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging. Some patients with nr-AxSpA will suffer 
from  the  disease  for  decades,  and  probably  for  life,  without  any  evidence  of  radiographic 
damage.  It  is  also  possible  that  some  patients  with  nr-AxSpA  may  experience remission 
(Slobodin 2015).
A total of 677 patients with AS were followed at a hospital in Norway from 1977 to May 2009. 
Patients were matched by sex, age, and postal area to 3 controls from the general population. 
The  crude  mortality  among  patients  with  AS  was  14.5%  (98  patients);  SMR  was  only 
significantly increased among male patients compared with female patients (1.63% vs 1.38%, 
p<0.001).  Circulatory  disease  was  the  most  frequent  cause  of  death  (40.0%),  followed  by 
malignant  (26.8%)  and  infectious  (23.3%)  diseases  (Bakland 2011).  Data  on  mortality 
associated with nr-AxSpA are not available.
Important Comorbidities:
Comorbidities that occur frequently in patients with AS and nr-AxSpA or with consistently 
higher prevalence than controls include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, depression, and 
heart failure (Zhao 2020).
18
Indication: Ulcerative Colitis 
Incidence:
Ng (2017) conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1990 and 2016 which 
include  worldwide  incidence  rates  of  UC.  The  annual  incidence  rates  varied  by  geographic 
region with estimates ranging from 0.97 to 57.9 per 100,000 person-years in Europe and 8.8 to 
23.14 per 100,000 person-years in North America. The highest reported incidence rates were 
in the Faroe Islands (57.9 per 100,000 person-years) and Canada (23.14 per 100,000 person-
years). (Ng 2017)
In a study to evaluate the incidence of UC in the Uppsala Region, Sweden, all new UC patients 
were prospectively registered during 2005 to 2006 and during 2007 to 2009. The mean overall 
incidence  for  the  time  period  was  20.0  (95%  CI:  16.1-23.9)  cases  per  100,000 inhabitants 
(Sjöberg 2013).  Another  regional  Swedish  study  reported  an  incidence  rate  of  18.1 per 
100,000 population in 2010 (Eriksson 2017). A national study conducted in Denmark, which 
included all ages, estimated the incidence rate of UC in 2011 to be 22.4 (95% CI: 20.6-24.2) 
per 100,000 person-years for women and 23.5 (95% CI: 22.7-25.5) per 100,000 person-years
for  men.  This  is  an  increase  from  1995  when  the  rates  were  13.9 (95% CI: 12.1-15.0)  per 
100,000 person-years for women and 13.6 (95% CI: 11.9-14.8) per 100,000 person-years for 
men.  (Nørgård 2014).  In  the  Netherlands,  the  incidence  rate  has  been reported  at  17.2  per 
100,000 person-years (de Groof 2016).
In the US, the incidence of UC per 100,000 person-years was reported in the Nurses’ Health 
Study I and the Nurses’ Health study II, which include over 20 years of data, as follows: ages 
under 30 years, 12.9; ages 30 to 39 years, 9.1; ages 40 to 49 years, 6.9; ages 50 to 59 years, 
7.4; ages 60 to 69 years, 9.4; ages 70 years and older, 6.2. The age adjusted incidence of UC 
per 100,000 person-years ranged from 6.2 to 12.9. (Khalili 2012)
Prevalence:
In Europe, the prevalence of UC ranges from 2.4 to 294 per 100,000 persons (Burisch 2013). 
One  study  conducted  in  Spain  reported  the  prevalence  of  UC  in  2012  as  99.84  per 
100,000 population (Lucendo 2014). In the Netherlands, the point prevalence of UC has been 
reported as 225.6 per 100,000 population for 2004 to 2010 (de Groof 2016). A regional study 
in  Sweden  reported  the  point  prevalence  for  2010  to  be  474  (95%  CI:  444-506)  per 
100,000 inhabitants (Eriksson 2017).
The aforementioned study by Ng et al also analyzed prevalence rates of UC in the literature. 
The estimates ranged from 0.002% to 0.505% in Europe and 0.14% to 0.29% in North America. 
Prevalence rates were highest in Norway (0.51%) and the US (0.29%) (Ng 2017).
Kappelman et al (2013) estimated the prevalence of UC in the US to be 0.26% in 2009 based 
on data from the PharMetrics Choice Patient-Centric Database. After standardizing the data 
according 
that  approximately 
593,000 Americans had UC.

Demographics of the Population in the UC Indication (Age and Sex) and Risk Factors 
for the Disease: 
Ulcerative colitis is most commonly diagnosed in late adolescence and early adulthood, but the 
diagnosis may occur at any age. One US study using pharmaceutical claims data reported an 
incidence of 22.9 per 100,000 population for those >60 years and 2.4 per 100,000 population 
for  those  <18  years  (Keyashian 2019). Some  studies  of  UC have  reported sex-related 
differences in late-onset disease. Men are significantly more likely than women to be diagnosed 
in the fifth and sixth decades of life. A regional study conducted in Spain reported the incidence 
rate for UC in women was 2.7 per 100,000 population and 5.1 per 100,000 population in men
for 2007 to 2008 (Cueto Torreblanca 2017).
Risk Factors
Risk factors for UC include age (the onset of the disease usually being before the age of 30),
being white or of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, having a family history of the disease, and having 
used isotretinoin (Mayo Clinic. Ulcerative colitis: symptoms & causes). A high-fat diet may 
also  slightly  increase  the  chance  of  developing  UC (National  Institute  of  Diabetes  and 
Digestive and Kidney Disease). There is also evidence that use of NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, 
and antibiotics may also be associated with an increased risk of UC (Ye 2015).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
The goal of medical treatment is to reduce the inflammation that triggers signs and symptoms 
of  UC.  In  the  best  cases,  this  may  lead  not  only  to  symptom  relief  but  also  to  long-term 
remission.  Anti-inflammatory  drugs,  immunosuppressants, anti-TNFα  agents, and  other 
biologics  are  used  in  the  pharmacologic  management  of  UC.  Other  approaches  used  in  the 
treatment  of  UC  include  antagonism  of  integrin  receptors.  In  addition,  medications  such  as 
antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, pain relievers, and iron supplements may be used in the treatment 
of UC.
If diet, lifestyle changes, or drug therapy do not relieve signs and symptoms of UC, surgery 
may be recommended. Surgery can often eliminate UC but usually means removing the entire 
colon and rectum (Mayo Clinic. Ulcerative colitis: diagnosis & treatment).
Natural History of UC in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and Morbidity:
Since observational studies generally include a treated population, it is difficult to describe the 
course of the disease in the untreated population and to differentiate the effects of treatment 
from the natural history of the disease. The natural course of UC is characterized by periods of 
flare  alternating  with  periods  of  remission,  and  disease  activity  can  decrease  over  time
(Cosnes 2011). A study conducted in Denmark reported that after the first 2 years of follow-
up, approximately 50% of patients were in remission, and the proportion of patients with active 
disease gradually reduced to 30%. There was a cumulative probability of clinical relapse of 
81.6% after 5 years. In adults with UC, extension from the initial location was reported to vary 
from 10% to 19%  of patients after 5  years of  disease  and from  11%  to 28%  after 10  years 
(Duricova 2014).
20
A prospective IBD register in the catchment area of Finland followed UC patients from 1986
to 2007. The authors found an SMR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.77-1.06). For cause-specific mortality,
the risk of death in diseases of the digestive system was increased, although not significantly 
in UC (SMR: 2.1). Compared with the background population, there were significantly fewer 
deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol (Manninen 2012).
Important Comorbidities:
Comorbidities that occur frequently in patients with UC include uveitis, episcleritis, arthritis, 
hepatobiliary  disorders,  infections  such  as  Helicobacter pylori,  celiac  disease,  obesity, 
cardiovascular  conditions  (including  venous  thromboembolism  and  atherosclerosis),  and 
anxiety and mood disorders (Burisch 2013; Román 2011).
21
Indication: Polyarticular JIA
Incidence:
Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  is  considered  to  be  the  most  common  rheumatic  disease  of 
JIA  includes  6 categories  of  chronic  pediatric  arthritis:  systemic  onset, 
childhood.
oligoarticular, polyarticular, enthesis-related, psoriatic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. 
In  Canada,  the  incidence  of  JIA  was  estimated  at  8.47  per  100,000  population 
(95% CI: 7.93-9.05)  in  2011/2012  (Shiff 2019).  One  US  study  reported  an  overall  age- and 
sex-adjusted incidence of 10.3 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 7.9-12.7) (Krause 2016). In 
Sweden, the incidence of JIA has been estimated to be 12.8 per 100,000 children <16 years 
(Berthold 2019). A systematic review of 29 studies reported pJIA incidence to range from 0 to 
8.9 per 100,000 population, with an age and gender standardized pooled incidence of 1.6 per 
100,000  population  (95%  CI:  1.5-1.7)  (Thierry 2014). Studies  distinguishing  rheumatoid 
factor (RF)+ from RF- pJIA reported pooled incidences of 0.4 per 100,000 children (95% CI:
0.3-0.5)  and  1.0  per  100,000 children  (95%  CI:  0.9-1.2),  respectively (Thierry 2014).  In  a 
Swedish  study,  21%  of  JIA  was  estimated  to  be  RF+  or  RF-,  corresponding  to  a  derived 
incidence of 2.7 per 100,000 children (Berthold 2019).
Prevalence:
Prevalence of pJIA ranges from 1.6 to 54.2 per 100,000 population with a pooled prevalence 
of  6.3  per  100,000  population  (95%  CI:  5.7-6.9).  The  wide  range  has  been  attributed  to 
diagnostic difficulties, new diagnostic criteria and differing definitions developed over time, 
various  means  of  case  ascertainment,  health  care  resources  and  increasing  knowledge,  and 
small studies leading to chance variation in rates (Thierry 2014). The prevalence of rheumatoid 
factor-positive pJIA in Europe has been estimated at 4.2 per 100,000 population based on data 
collected from registries and the published medical literature (Orphanet Report Series 2019).
Approximately 5% of children with JIA are diagnosed with the psoriatic form of the disease 
(Stoll 2020).
Demographics of the Population in the pJIA Indication (Age and Sex) and Risk Factors 
for the Disease: 
More females than males are affected by JIA; however, the sex distribution varies by subtype. 
There  is  a  female  predominance  in  the  oligoarticular  and  polyarticular  subtypes,  an  even 
distribution of sexes in the systemic subtype, and a male predominance in the enthesitis-related 
arthritis subtype. A systematic review of  the published medical literature reported  a pooled 
incidence rate of 10.0 (95% CI: 9.4-10.7) for girls and 5.7 (95% CI: 5.3-6.2) for boys, and a 
pooled prevalence rate of 19.4 (95% CI: 18.3-20.6) for girls and 11.0 (95% CI: 10.2-11.9) for 
boys for JIA (Thierry 2014). The peak age of onset of JIA is 2 to 3 years of age, with a second 
peak  in  mid  adolescence  (Stoll 2020).  In  North  America,  the  Childhood  Arthritis  and 
Rheumatology Research Alliance registry reported a racial distribution for JIA of 93% white, 
5% African American, and 3% Asian. African American and Asian patients also tended to have 
an  older  mean  age  of  onset,  8.7  and  7.7  years  respectively,  compared  to  whites,  6.4  years 
(Ringold 2013).
Risk Factors
Risk factors for pJIA include genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers; however, the 
mechanism remains unclear (Huang 2012). It has also been reported that the incidence of JIA

is higher in urban areas and in families with higher incomes than controls. Winter is the peak 
time of year for the reported onset of symptoms (Oberle 2014). Possible environmental risk 
factors  include  infectious  agents,  antibiotic  exposure,  and  Cesarean-section  delivery 
(Horton 2019). Abnormalities in microbiota have also been implicated as possible risk factors 
for JIA (Arvonen 2016).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
The management of pJIA is based on a combination of pharmacological management, physical 
and  occupational  therapy,  and  psychosocial  support.  Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs, 
corticosteroids,  intra-articular  steroid  injections,  DMARDs,  anti-TNFα  agents, and  other 
biologics (including T-cell costimulation and IL-6 inhibitors) are used in the treatment of pJIA 
(Gowdie 2012; Hinze 2015; Onel 2022; Ringold 2019).
Natural History of JIA and pJIA in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity:
The  disease  course  and  prognosis  of  JIA  remain  variable  but  have  improved  with  the 
development of  new  therapies. In a large single-center study  in Spain, 69%  of  JIA  patients 
attained clinical remission according to the Wallace criteria over a 9-year follow-up period; 
among pJIA patients, this estimate was 59% (Castillo-Vilella 2021). Compared to children with 
involvement of fewer joints, children with pJIA (defined as arthritis affecting 5 or more joints 
during  the  first  6 months  of  disease)  tend  to  have  a  more  refractory  course  of  disease.  In 
addition,  children  with  pJIA  are  at  increased  risk  for  joint  damage,  resulting  in  poorer 
functional outcomes and decreased quality of life (Oberle 2014). 
The most common feature of all JIA subtypes is arthritis, which is clinically characterized by 
joint effusion, joint line tenderness and warmth, restricted range of movement, and limitation 
of movement secondary to pain. Systemic symptoms of pJIA can include fatigue, weight loss, 
anemia,  and  anorexia.  Growth  abnormalities  can  complicate  pJIA  and  result  in  bony 
overgrowth,  prematurely  fused  epiphyzes,  and  limb  length  discrepancies  (Gowdie 2012). 
Additionally,  patients  may  experience  other  physical  disabilities,  vision  loss  including 
blindness, and mental health issues. Uncontrolled arthritis can progress to contractures, limited 
range of motion, and significant disability (Crayne 2018).
Children with jPsA tend to have more involvement of the wrists and small joints of the hands 
and feet than patients with oligoarticular JIA. They also have a more complicated course of 
disease with an increased likelihood of extension into polyarticular disease (Stoll 2020). 
A US study of patients classified as having juvenile RA, followed from 1960 to 2013, reported 
4 deaths over 2187.7 person-years of follow-up, which was marginally higher than expected 
(Krause 2016).  The  British  Society  for  Paediatric  and  Adolescent  Rheumatology (BSPAR)
Etanercept Cohort Study and Biologics for Children with Rheumatic Disease study in the UK 
reported a mortality incidence rate of  1.1 (95%  CI: 0.5-2.0)  per 1,000 person-years with an 
SMR of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.4-5.2) for JIA patients (Davies 2017). A population study conducted 
in  Finland  that  followed  all  patients  with  JIA  from  2000 to  2015 reported  a  cumulative 
mortality  rate  of  0.6%  (95%  CI:  0.3-1.2)  for  JIA  patients  compared  with 0.6% 
(95% CI: 0.4-1.0) for controls (Kyllönen 2019).
23
Important Comorbidities:
Comorbidities  that  occur  frequently  in  patients  with  pJIA  include  uveitis,  growth 
abnormalities, and psychosocial factors (Crayne 2018; Gowdie 2012).

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SII: Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification
Relevance to Human Usage
No toxicities related to the inhibition of TNFα were 
observed in studies of cynomolgus monkeys and 
mice. There is a large clinical safety margin relative to 
the maximum cynomolgus monkey exposure (up to 
560 times relative to the human dose and up to 
1,000 times the human exposure). The nonclinical 
data do not indicate a safety concern for humans. 
Results of reproductive toxicity studies suggest that 
inhibition of TNF is unlikely to affect human male or 
female fertility.
Key Safety Findings
Toxicity
Repeat-dose toxicity
In cynomolgus monkeys, no signs of toxicity 
considered to be golimumab-related were 
observed with once-weekly intravenous (IV)
doses or twice weekly SC doses up to 
50 mg/kg for up to 6 months of treatment 
(9 months of exposure).
In the 6-month IV study, a slight 
dose-dependent increase in circulating 
lymphocytes and a slight decrease in the 
humoral immune response to the T-cell 
dependent neoantigen keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin (KLH) was seen. In the 6-month 
SC toxicology study, a slight increase in 
circulating lymphocytes similar to that seen in 
the 6-month IV study was observed. These 
effects were not considered to be 
toxicologically significant.
In mice, no signs of toxicity considered to be 
related to the inhibition of TNFα were 
observed with weekly doses of anti-mouse 
TNFα mAb (cV1q) up to 40 mg/kg for 
6 months.
Reproductive toxicity
Golimumab does not bind to human 
reproductive tissues in vitro.
Young adult cynomolgus monkeys exposed to 
golimumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg weekly IV
or twice weekly SC for up to 6 months showed 
no toxicity of the reproductive organs 
(spermatogenesis was not evaluated).
Fertility studies have not been conducted with 
golimumab in cynomolgus monkeys. Fertility 
studies have been conducted in mice using 
cV1q. In the mouse fertility study, there was a 
slight reduction in the number of male mice 
that mated (91% versus 100% in controls) and 
a reduction in the number of successful 
pregnancies (fertility index 76% versus 92% in 
controls). This reduction is only slightly 
outside of the test facility historical 
background ranges; semen parameters (sperm 
motility, count, and density) were not affected 
by treatment. Therefore, the apparent reduction 
in the fertility index was not considered to be 
due to a reduction in male fertility.
25
Key Safety Findings
Developmental toxicity
No developmental defects were seen in 
monkeys from mothers exposed to golimumab 
during the embryonic period (gestation day 
[GD] 20 through GD 50) or during the fetal
period (GD 50 through birth [approximately 
GD 165]) and for the first 33 days of lactation 
at doses up to 50 mg/kg SC twice weekly. 
Fetuses were exposed to golimumab during 
gestation and the fetal exposure increased with 
gestational age during the fetal period. Low 
levels of golimumab were secreted in breast 
milk (350-fold lower than in maternal serum).
Dosing of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with 
golimumab produced no maternal or fetal
toxicity. Exposure of developing monkeys to 
golimumab during gestation and during the 
postnatal period produced no morphological 
abnormalities in the fetuses and no structural 
or functional defects in the neonates. Neonatal 
immune competence, as determined by the 
ability to mount a humoral immune response to 
the T-dependent neoantigen KLH and a 
delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction, 
were unaffected by exposure to golimumab 
during pre- and postnatal development.
In pregnant mice dosed with cV1q there was 
no maternal toxicity and no developmental 
defects in the offspring. A slight reduction in 
the humoral immune response to sheep red 
blood cells was observed in the female 
offspring from mothers exposed to cV1q at 
40 mg/kg weekly IV in one study, but this was 
not repeated in a second study.
Genotoxicity
No genotoxicity studies were conducted.
Carcinogenicity
The risk of reduced tumor immune 
surveillance resulting in susceptibility to 
certain tumors (lymphomas and skin cancer) is 
a safety concern for immune-modulating drugs 
in general. No tumors were detected in 
monkeys dosed with golimumab for up to 
6 months or in mice dosed with cV1q for 
6 months. Rodent 2-year carcinogenicity 
studies have not been conducted because this 
bioassay is a poor predictor of malignancy due 
to immune suppression. Mice that have been 
genetically modified to lack TNF and 
wild-type mice dosed with anti-mouse TNF 
inhibitors have not shown an increased 
incidence of tumors (Bugelski 2010).
Relevance to Human Usage
The developmental studies conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys with golimumab and in mice with cV1q 
have shown no maternal toxicity and no 
developmental abnormalities in the offspring. The 
cynomolgus monkey studies showed that fetuses are 
exposed to golimumab during the fetal period and that 
exposure increases with gestational age. This profile 
is expected to be similar in humans and is similar to 
that of endogenous IgG antibodies. It is expected that 
human infants born to golimumab-treated mothers
will have golimumab in their serum at birth and that 
TNF will be inhibited until the serum concentration 
falls below a pharmacologically relevant level.
Golimumab may be secreted in small amounts in 
breast milk.
There is a theoretical risk of malignancy associated 
with administration of golimumab based on the 
clinical experience with TNF inhibitors and other 
immune suppressive drugs.
26
Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Other toxicity-related information or data
Risk of infection
The risk of infection is a safety concern for 
immune-modulating drugs in general. In the 
6-month toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, there was a slight decrease in the 
humoral immune response to KLH. 
One golimumab-treated animal developed 
disseminated histoplasmosis. In the mouse 
developmental study, there was a slight 
decrease in the humoral immune response to 
sheep red blood cells.
Published rodent studies suggest that inhibition 
of TNF may lead to a reduction in the host 
protective immune responses to viral, bacterial, 
intracellular protozoa, and fungal pathogens 
(Martin 2012) 
Nonclinical studies have shown that inhibition of TNF 
may be associated with a slight suppression of 
immune responses to certain antigenic challenges. The 
single incidence of histoplasmosis in a 
golimumab-treated monkey cannot be definitively 
linked to golimumab treatment, although increased 
susceptibility to infections, including opportunistic 
infections has been identified clinically.
27
PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure
SIII.1
Brief Overview of Development
The  clinical  development  program  for  golimumab  includes  trials  in  rheumatological 
indications (RA, PsA, AS, and nr-AxSpA, pJIA) and in subjects with UC. 
In an exploratory clinical trial involving subjects with severe persistent asthma (C0524T03), 
more subjects treated with golimumab developed malignancies compared with control subjects 
(SmPC, Sections 4.4 [Special warnings and precautions for use] and 4.8 [Undesirable effects]). 
Therefore, data from trial C0524T03 are included in Module SIII.2 (Clinical Trial Exposure) 
and  Module  SVII.3 (Details  of  Important  Identified  Risks,  Important  Potential  Risks,  and 
Missing Information).
SIII.2
Clinical Trial Exposure
Exposure to golimumab in the clinical trials population is summarized in Tables SIII.1 through 
SIII.28 for all subjects by duration, age and sex, dose, and ethnic origin. 
Data are presented for (1) the controlled portions of clinical trials and (2) through the end of 
the reporting period (ie, all portions of clinical trials including open-label extensions). 
Trial design (eg, duration of the placebo-controlled portion of the trial, start of the open-label 
extension, early escape to active treatment), and varying data cut-offs for each trial account for 
the differences in the numbers of subjects treated with golimumab, as shown in the tables.
Exposure in the Controlled Portions of Clinical Trials
Data from the following trials are included in the tables describing exposure in the controlled 
portions of clinical trials:



SC/IV Phase 2 and 3 trials in the rheumatologic indications (RA, PsA, AS, and nr-AxSpA): 
C0524T02,  C0524T05,  C0524T06,  C0524T11,  C0524T12,  CNTO148ART3001, 
C0524T28,  C0524T08,  C0524T09,  P07642,  C0524T29,  CNTO148PSA3001,  and 
CNTO148AKS3001.
SC Phase 2b trial in asthma (C0524T03)
SC/IV Phase 2/3 trials in UC (C0524T16 and C0524T17)
The duration of exposure was calculated as the time from the first dose to the date of the last 
visit in the controlled period. If a subject discontinued the study agent prior to the last visit date 
in the controlled period, then exposure for that subject was calculated as the time from the first 
dose to the last dose during the controlled period.
During  the  placebo-controlled  portions  of  golimumab  clinical  trials  noted  above,  a  total  of 
4,560 subjects were exposed to golimumab (Tables SIII.1 through SIII.12).
Exposure  to  golimumab  during  the  controlled  portion  of  the  clinical  trials was  greatest  in 
subjects with RA, both in the number of subjects treated and the total subject-years of follow-
up. The majority of subjects received either 50 or 100 mg golimumab administered SC, with 
the total number of subjects treated and the total exposure greater for 100 mg than 50 mg. There 
28
were  more  female  subjects  than  male  subjects  in  these  golimumab  clinical  trials  and  the 
majority  of  subjects  were  white.  In  addition,  the  majority  of  subjects  were  between  18  and 
64 years of age.

Exposure Through the End of the Reporting Period
Data  from  the  following  completed  trials  in  adults  and  children  are  included  in  the  tables 
describing exposure through the end of the reporting period (ie, all portions of clinical trials,
including open-label extensions):




SC/IV Phase 2 and 3 trials in the rheumatologic indications (RA, PsA, AS, and nr-AxSpA: 
C0524T02, C0524T05, C0524T06, C0524T11, C0524T12 [SC portion only in the long-
term  extension  of  trial],  CNTO148ART3001,  C0524T28,  C0524T08,  C0524T09, 
C0524T29, P07642, CNTO148PSA3001, and CNTO148AKS3001).
SC Phase 2b trial in asthma (C0524T03)
SC/IV Phase 2/3 trials in UC (C0524T16, C0524T17, and C0524T18)
SC Phase 3 trial in pJIA (CNTO148JIA3001)
A total of 6,381 subjects were exposed to golimumab in adult trials (Tables SIII.13, SIII.17, 
SIII.21, and SIII.25). A total of 173 subjects were exposed to golimumab in the pediatric pJIA 
trial (Tables SIII.16, SIII.20, SIII.24, and SIII.28).
Rheumatoid arthritis was the indication with the greatest exposure to golimumab through the 
end of the reporting period, both in the number of subjects treated and the total subject-years 
of follow-up. The majority of subjects received either 50 or 100 mg golimumab administered 
SC with total exposure greater for 100 mg than for 50 mg. As seen in the controlled portion of 
these clinical trials, there were more female subjects than male subjects through the end of the 
reporting period and the majority of subjects were white. In addition, through the end of the 
reporting period, the majority of subjects were between 18 and 64 years of age.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SIV: Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1.
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Within the Development 
Program
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Had a known hypersensitivity to human Ig proteins or other components of golimumab. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to human IgG 
proteins or any of the components of golimumab would be 
at a higher risk of subsequent serious systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions with re-exposure. 
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
SIMPONI is contraindicated in patients with a history of 
hypersensitivity to golimumab or to any of the excipients 
(SmPC, section 4.3).
Had an active infection:




Active granulomatous infection, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis.
Current active infection, including tuberculosis.
Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or opportunistic infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, 
Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis) within 6 months prior to the start of treatment with 
golimumab.
Serious infection (eg, hepatitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis), or hospitalized for an 
infection, or treated with IV antibiotics for an infection within 2 months prior to the start of 
treatment with golimumab.
 Ongoing chronic recurrent infectious disease.
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Treatment with anti-TNFα agents may increase the risk of 
the development of infections or worsen an existing 
infection. Serious infections are considered a class effect 
of these agents.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Serious infections is an important identified risk. 
Information about infections is described in the SmPC. 
The risk to this patient population is adequately addressed 
in the SmPC and the Patient Reminder Card.
46
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Had a history of, or concurrent, congestive heart failure, including medically controlled, 
asymptomatic congestive heart failure. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist, worsening 
congestive heart failure (CHF) and increased mortality 
due to CHF have been observed.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Moderate or severe heart failure (New York Heart 
Association [NYHA] class III/IV) is a contraindication in 
the SmPC. The risk to this patient population is 
adequately addressed in the SmPC.
Had a history of latent granulomatous infection including tuberculosis (exception C0524T11), 
histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis.
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Treatment with anti-TNFα agents may increase the risk of 
the development of infections or worsen an existing 
infection.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Serious infections is an important identified risk. 
Information about infections, including tuberculosis (TB),
is described in the SmPC. The risk to this patient 
population is adequately addressed in the SmPC and the 
Patient Reminder Card.
Were known to be infected with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Treatment with anti-TNFα agents may increase the risk of 
the development of infections or worsen an existing 
infection. In addition, the use of anti-TNFα agents has
been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of the 
virus.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Serious infections is an important identified risk. 
Information about infections, including hepatitis B, is 
described in the SmPC. The risk to this patient population 
is adequately addressed in the SmPC and the Patient 
Reminder Card.
47
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Had a history of chronic or recurrent infectious disease. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Treatment with anti-TNFα agents may increase the risk of 
the development of infections or worsen an existing 
infection.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that caution should be 
exercised when considering the use of SIMPONI in 
patients with a chronic infection or a history or recurrent 
infection.
Had current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, 
gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, or cerebral disease. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
This is a typical, prudent, precautionary position applied 
to clinical trial subjects when a drug was not widely used 
in humans.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
The impracticalities of identifying adequate numbers of 
patients with similar progressive concomitant disease in 
each of these categories precludes the further study of 
SIMPONI in these patient populations. These components 
are therefore not considered appropriate for further study 
under the category of missing information.
Given the severity of disease in subjects with severe, 
progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, 
gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, 
neurologic, psychiatric, or cerebral disease, the 
risk/benefit balance of the use of SIMPONI should be 
carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Guidance on 
the use of SIMPONI in subjects with hematologic and 
neurologic disorders is provided in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC (Special warnings and precautions for use).
Had a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma, or signs suggestive of possible 
lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or location, or clinically 
significant splenomegaly. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Use of anti-TNFα agents has been associated with the 
occurrence of lymphoma.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Malignancy is an important identified risk. The risk of 
lymphoma in this patient population is adequately 
addressed in the SmPC.
48
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Had any known malignancy or had a history of malignancy within the previous 5 years (with the 
exception of a nonmelanoma skin cancer that had been treated with no evidence of recurrence). 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Published medical literature suggests that certain types of 
malignancies may be adversely affected by TNFα 
blockade. The potential role of TNF-blocking therapy in 
the development of certain types of malignancies is not 
known.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Malignancy is an important identified risk. The risk to this 
patient population is adequately addressed in the SmPC.
Had received or were expected to receive any live virus or bacterial vaccination (including Bacille 
Calmette-Guérin) within 3 to 12 months before the first administration of the study 
agent/screening, during the trial, or within 6 months after the last administration. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Treatment with anti-TNFα agents may increase the risk of 
the development of infections or worsen an existing 
infection.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Breakthrough infection after administration of live 
vaccines in infants exposed to golimumab in utero is an 
important potential risk. The risk of live vaccinations is 
adequately addressed in the SmPC and the Patient 
Reminder Card.
History of known demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Anti-TNFα agents have been associated with 
demyelinating diseases (central and peripheral) and these 
events are considered a class effect for these agents.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Demyelinating disorders is an important identified risk. 
The risk to this patient population is adequately addressed 
in the SmPC.
Had previously used any biologics (eg, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, 
natalizumab) as specified in the protocol.
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
These agents were prohibited or required a washout 
period to reduce the risk of concomitant 
immunosuppression or the risk of adverse events (AEs) 
after the use of these agents.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
49
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
This risk is adequately addressed in the SmPC.
Had used cytotoxic agents, including chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, or other 
alkylating agents. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
To reduce the risk of concomitant immunosuppressants or 
the risk of AEs after cytotoxic agent use, these agents 
were prohibited or required a washout period.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
The concomitant use of biologics and other 
immunosuppressants for the treatment of autoimmune 
disease is associated with an increase in AEs with no 
increase in efficacy (Genovese 2004; Weinblatt 2006).
The risk of immunosuppression with SIMPONI and 
interactions with other medicinal products is addressed in 
the SmPC (section 4.4). 
Pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy or fathering a child within 6 months after receiving the 
last administration of trial medication. 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Per International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)
guidelines, pregnant women should normally be excluded 
from clinical trials.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Exposure during pregnancy
Guidance for the use of SIMPONI during pregnancy is 
provided in the SmPC (section 4.6).
Neither routine nor additional pharmacovigilance 
activities have identified any safety signals associated 
with the use of SIMPONI during pregnancy. The MAH 
considers that sufficient exposure data have been collected 
and no longer considers exposure during pregnancy as 
missing information.
Use during breastfeeding
Guidance for the use of SIMPONI during breastfeeding is 
provided in the SmPC (section 4.6).
Had a transplanted organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant performed >3 months prior 
to first administration of trial medication). 
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
The risk of concomitant major immunosuppression was 
unclear at the start of the clinical development program.
Considered to be included as missing 
information?
No
50
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Patients with transplanted organs are generally receiving 
other immunosuppressants. It would not be appropriate to 
put these patients at risk by studying the use of SIMPONI
in this population.
SIV.2.
Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial 
Development Programs
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions due to prolonged exposure, adverse reactions due 
to cumulative effect, and adverse reactions that have a long latency.
SIV.3.
Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Program(s)
Table SIV.2: Exposure of Special Populations Included or Not in Clinical Trial 
Development Programs
Type of Special Population
Exposure
Pregnant women
Breastfeeding women
Although prohibited by protocol, exposure to 
SIMPONI during pregnancy occurred in the 
clinical development program.
A total of 101 cases of exposure to SIMPONI 
during pregnancy were reported in clinical 
trials.
Breastfeeding women were not included in the 
clinical development program.
Patients with relevant comorbidities:





Patients with hepatic impairment
Patients with renal impairment
Patients with cardiovascular impairment
Immunocompromised patients
Patients with a disease severity different 
from inclusion criteria in clinical trials
Population with relevant different ethnic origin
Generally, patients with relevant comorbidities 
were not included in the clinical development 
program. 
However, by default, subjects participating in 
SIMPONI clinical trials are 
immunocompromised as a result of their 
underlying disease, their concomitant 
medications, and by virtue of receiving 
treatment with a TNFα inhibitor.
SIMPONI clinical trials have been conducted 
globally in a variety of ethnic groups. The 
majority of subjects in clinical trials were white.
Subpopulations carrying relevant genetic 
polymorphisms
Not included in the clinical development 
program.
Children
A total of 173 children aged ≥2 to <18 years of 
age were exposed to SIMPONI in the completed 
CNTO148JIA3001 trial in pJIA.
51
Type of Special Population
Exposure
Elderly
A total of 500 subjects ≥65 years old (160 male 
and 340 female) have been exposed to 
SIMPONI in the completed clinical trials. Of 
these subjects, 74 were ≥75 years old. 
52
PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SV: Postauthorization Experience
SV.1.
Postauthorization Exposure
SV.1.1.
Method used to Calculate Exposure
Postmarketing Exposure
Reporting frequencies calculated using exposure data do not reflect occurrence rates. Multiple 
factors  influence  the  reporting  of  spontaneous  experiences  and  therefore,  caution  must  be 
exercised in the analysis and evaluation of spontaneous reports. In addition, product exposure 
is estimated at the time of distribution, not at the time of usage. There is a delay between the 
times a medication is distributed until it is used by a patient.
Patient Exposure (Person-Time)
Patient exposure was estimated by calculation from distribution data. Estimates of exposure 
are based upon finished product. The patient exposure estimates for commercially used drug 
were calculated using models generated by the Company using insurance claims and hospital 
discharge data in the US and customized Market Research studies in major markets for outside 
of the US. These models will be refined over time as usage changes and the companies have 
come  to  understand  usage  better.  Estimates  of  golimumab  commercial  units  sold,  patients 
exposed to golimumab in the current period and a cumulative estimate of patients exposed from 
launch are presented. For golimumab, each single-use auto-injector or PFS contains 50 mg of 
golimumab. The recommended dosage for approved indications excluding the UC indication 
is  50  mg  given  as  a  SC  injection  once  a  month,  on  the  same  date  every  month.  For  some 
patients,  the  appropriate  dosing  is  100  mg  per month, and  the  assumption  is  that 1 unit  is 
equivalent to 1 person-month. The estimate for number of patients exposed in the setting of 
commercial  use  includes  registries, postmarketing surveillance  studies,  and  epidemiology 
studies. Cumulative estimates for patients in a specific Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report 
(PBRER)/Periodic Safety  Update Report (PSUR) period are estimated by  adding the newly 
treated patients in that period to the estimate of cumulative patients treated as reported in the 
previous  PBRER/PSUR  period  after  accounting  for  patients  that  may  have  dropped  off 
treatment. This prevents double counting of patients.
SV.1.2.
Exposure
The  worldwide  registered  formulations of  golimumab  are  solution  for  injection  for  SC 
administration and solution for IV infusion. The IV formulation of golimumab is not approved 
in the EU; therefore, this section of the EU-RMP presents postmarketing exposure information 
for the SC formulation only. 
As  described  in  the  EU PBRER/PSUR  (cut-off  date:  06 April 2023),  the  exposure  to 
commercial golimumab in person-time from launch through 28 February 2023 is 21,649,522
person-months or 1,804,127 person-years. 
Table SV.1 below presents the cumulative SC golimumab patient exposure by indication and 
region from launch.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SVI: Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
No trials have been conducted to evaluate the dependence potential of golimumab. Drugs with 
abuse potential generally include drugs that affect the central nervous system, drugs that are 
chemically or pharmacologically similar to other drugs with known abuse potential, and drugs 
that produce psychoactive effects such as sedation, euphoria, or mood change (Food and Drug 
Administration. Assessment of abuse potential of drugs. Guidance for industry).
As  a  class,  therapeutic  mAbs  are  not  associated  with  dependence; their chemical  structure 
differs  from  central  nervous  system-active  drugs  associated  with  dependence.  The 
pharmaceutical 
(PD)
and  pharmacokinetic
characteristics of  golimumab are not characteristic of  drugs  with high dependence potential

New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an 
Updated RMP
With the completion of the MK-8259-013 and MK-8259-042 studies, and following a review 
of available data to date, the important potential risk “Colon cancer/dysplasia (in ulcerative 
colitis)” and  missing  information  “Long-term  safety  in  adult  patients  with  UC” have  been 
removed from the list of safety concerns. 
Rationale for Removal of the Important Potential Risk “Colon carcinoma/dysplasia (in 
ulcerative colitis)”
 The  MK-8259-013  and  MK-8259-042  studies  are  the  only  remaining  additional 
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  the  SIMPONI  EU-RMP  to  address  the  important 
potential  risk  “Colon  cancer/dysplasia  (in  ulcerative  colitis)”. Long-term  data  from 
these studies  showed no  increased  risk  of  colon carcinoma/dysplasia  in  UC patients 
treated with golimumab.
 The results of a cumulative evaluation of data from the Global Medical Safety (GMS)
global safety database and the published literature do not support a causal association 
between  golimumab exposure and the development of  colon cancer/dysplasia  in UC 
patients.
 Colon  cancer/dysplasia  will  be  addressed  in  the  EU-RMP  under  the  more  general 
important identified risk “Malignancy” and will continue to be evaluated in the PSUR.
 Routine  pharmacovigilance activities (including  the Topic of  Interest [TOI]  targeted 
follow-up  questionnaire  [TFUQ]  to  collect  information  on  malignancy  events)  and 
routine risk minimization measures (as described in Section 4.4 of the SIMPONI SmPC
and Section 2 of the Patient Leaflet) are sufficient to manage the risk. 
 Clinical  recommendations  for  the  management  of  colon  carcinoma/dysplasia  are 
included in European guidelines (Magro 2017; ECCO 2021).
57
Rationale for Removal of Missing Information “Long-term safety in adult patients with 
UC”
 SIMPONI has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with UC and has been 
used in clinical practice for this indication for more than 10 years.
 Reviews of postmarketing data from the GMS global safety database and the published 
literature  did  not  identify  any  new  risks  that  impact  the  benefit-risk  balance  of 
SIMPONI during long-term use in adult patients with UC.
 The  MK-8259-013  and  MK-8259-042  studies  are  the  only  remaining  additional 
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  the  SIMPONI  EU-RMP  to  address  the  missing 
information  “Long-term  safety  in  adult  patients  with  UC”. It  is  not  expected  that 
additional pharmacovigilance activities will further inform on the safety profile in this 
population.
 The  long-term  safety  of  SIMPONI in  adult  patients  with  UC is  therefore  no  longer 
considered missing information.

the sum  of  events for placebo/active comparator and the number events for  golimumab ≤5, 
odds ratio was not calculated.
Tables presenting integrated data are included in Section SVII.3.1 for all risks where events 
were reported in the adult clinical trials in RA, PsA, nr-AxSpA, UC, and asthma. Tables are 
not presented if there were no events relating to a particular risk in the adult clinical trials; a

SVII.3.1.
Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks
Important Identified Risk: Serious Infections
Potential Mechanisms:
Tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha is  a  mediator  of  cellular  immune  responses  and  inflammation, 
which  are  important  in  host  defense  against  certain  pathogens,  especially  intracellular 
pathogens. Anti-TNFα agent therapy reduces the ability to mount an inflammatory response 
against  such  pathogens.  SIMPONI  may  therefore  inhibit  protective  immune  responses  to 
intracellular bacteria (including mycobacteria) and opportunistic pathogens and may also allow 
HBV reactivation.
Evidence source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Because they suppress the immune system, drugs that inhibit TNFα have been associated with 
an increased risk of serious infections (some fatal), including opportunistic infections, TB, and 
invasive  fungal  infections.  Drugs  that  inhibit  TNFα  have  also  been  associated  with  HBV 
reactivation in patients who are chronic carriers of the virus.
Serious infections, including opportunistic infections and TB, have been reported in patients 
treated  with  SIMPONI  in  clinical  trials  and  in  the  postmarketing  setting.  Hepatitis  B  virus
reactivation has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with SIMPONI. 
These findings are consistent with nonclinical data and published medical literature.
Serious  infections  is  considered  an  important  identified  risk  because  of  the  consistency  of 
evidence across multiple sources, including data from products in the same class.
Characterization of the Risk – Data:
Data  for  serious  infections  are  presented  in  the  tables  below  and  grouped  in  the  following 
subcategories:  serious  infections,  opportunistic  infections,  and  TB.  No  events  of  HBV 
reactivation  were  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  therefore  no  tables  are  presented  for  this 
subcategory. In the Phase 3 pJIA trial (CNTO148JIA3001), in addition to no events of HBV 
reactivation, no events of opportunistic infection or active TB were reported and therefore no 
tables are provided for these subcategories.

Characterization of the Risk – Discussion:
Serious infections are considered a class effect of anti-TNFα agents. Infections are described 
in the SIMPONI SmPC (Section 4.3 [Contraindications], Section 4.4 [Special warnings and 
precautions for use], and Section 4.8 [Undesirable effects]). 
In the All Randomized Blinded Trials Population of All Trials with SIMPONI, the frequency 
of serious infections in golimumab-treated subjects was 1.5% compared with 1.2% for those 
who received placebo or comparator. Of note, the frequency of opportunistic infections and TB 
in  the All  Randomized  Blinded  Trials  Population  of  All  Trials was  similar  for 
golimumab-treated subjects and those who received placebo or comparator. 
Although  patients  with  a  history  of  latent  granulomatous  infection, including  TB, were 
generally  excluded  from  clinical  trials,  patients  with  a  newly  positive  tuberculin  skin  test 
(during screening) or a positive QuantiFERON-TB test were eligible for trial participation in 
the SC Phase 3 RA, PsA, AS, and nr-AxSpA trials, as well as the IV Phase 3 PsA, AS, and RA 
trials, if they received appropriate treatment for latent TB prior to or simultaneously with the 
first  administration  of  trial  medication.  In  the  SC  Phase  3 trials,  334  subjects  had  TB 
prophylaxis, 239 of whom received golimumab; none of these subjects developed active TB. 
In the IV Phase 3 RA, PsA, and AS trials, a total of 235 subjects had TB prophylaxis and none 
developed active TB. During the UC trial C0524T18, 7 subjects were diagnosed with active 
TB; 1 of these subjects was receiving TB prophylactic therapy and died from active TB. None 
of the other 6 subjects with active TB tested positive for latent TB at screening. 
Postmarketing  data  are  consistent  with  what  is  currently  known  about  the  risk  of  serious 
infections in patients treated with SIMPONI. A 5-year trending analysis, covering the period 
07 April 2018 to 28 February 2023, of the reporting rate (RR) of spontaneously reported cases 
of serious infections (including opportunistic infection and TB) in patients exposed to IV and 
SC SIMPONI in the postmarketing setting showed an overall decrease. For HBV reactivation, 
similar  5-year  postmarketing  trending  in  patients  exposed  to  SC  SIMPONI  shows  a  stable 
profile and no cases involving the IV route were identified during the 5-year reporting period. 
Based on review of data in the PBRER/PSUR (data lock point: 06 April 2023), no new safety 
information has been identified for this important identified risk. 
The  impact  of  this  risk  on  the  individual  patient  is  potentially  significant.  Patients  who  are 
exposed to and subsequently infected with an infectious agent may have a more severe course 
due to use of the product. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Serious Infections
Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  serious  infections  include  the  use  of  steroids,  other 
immunosuppressive drugs (including MTX), or other biologics at the same time as SIMPONI.
Opportunistic Infections
People whose immune status is compromised are susceptible to opportunistic infections. Risk 
factors for opportunistic infections may therefore include HIV disease, increased age, having 
an organ transplant, immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids, MTX, azathioprine, and 
biologic agents), chronic pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure.
71
Invasive Fungal Infections
People who have resided in or traveled to regions where invasive fungal infections are common 
are at increased risk.
Tuberculosis
The most common risk factors for the development of TB include conditions that weaken the 
immune  system  such  as  advanced  age,  HIV  infection,  alcohol  abuse,  malignancy,  use  of 
corticosteroids  or  other  immunosuppressive  drugs  such  as  MTX,  connective  tissue  disease, 
renal failure, diabetes, and pregnancy.
Other risk  factors for the development of  TB include contact with a person  with active TB 
infection and having been born in, lived in, or traveled to countries where the incidence of TB 
is  high.  Exposure  to  TB  may  occur  through  various  health  care  settings (eg,  hospitals  and 
nursing homes) or high-density institutions (eg, prisons). 
Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
Risk factors for the acquisition of HBV include being born to a mother from a highly endemic 
area, emigration from a highly endemic area, history of IV drug use, and a history of multiple 
sexual partners. Patients at risk for HBV reactivation are those who are chronic carriers of this 
virus  (ie,  surface  antigen-positive),  especially  those  who  become  immunosuppressed. 
Approximately 14% to 50% of immunosuppressed patients who are chronic carriers of HBV 
will experience acute reactivations during the natural history of their disease (Shibolet 2002). 
Thus, risk factors for HBV reactivation in patients with a history of HBV infection include the 
concomitant  use  of  medications  that  suppress  the  immune  system  (eg, chemotherapy, 
corticosteroids, MTX, azathioprine, TNFα inhibitors). Other risk factors that may contribute to 
HBV  reactivation  include  HIV  infection,  transplantation  (especially  bone  marrow),  and
withdrawal from immunosuppressive therapies (Ocama 2005).
Preventability:
SIMPONI is contraindicated in patients with active TB or other severe infections such as sepsis 
and  opportunistic  infections (SmPC  Section  4.3 [Contraindications]).  The  risk  of  serious 
infections is described in the Patient Reminder Card (see Part V.2). 
Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections
Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use)  states  that  golimumab 
should not be given to patients with a clinically important, active infection. Caution should be 
exercised  when  considering  the  use  of  golimumab  in  patients  with  a  chronic  infection  or  a 
history of recurrent infection. Patients should be advised of, and avoid exposure to, potential 
risk factors for infection as appropriate. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if 
signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, 
they should be closely monitored and golimumab should not be administered until the infection 
resolves.
72
Invasive Fungal Infections
Section 4.4 of the SmPC (Special warnings and precautions for use) states that for patients who 
have resided in or traveled to regions where invasive fungal infections are endemic, the benefits 
and risks of golimumab treatment should be carefully considered before initiation of therapy.
Tuberculosis
Patients who are being considered for golimumab therapy should be evaluated for TB infection. 
Golimumab should not be given to patients with active TB. Golimumab should not be given to 
patients  with  latent  TB  unless  treatment  for  latent  TB  is  initiated  prior  to  administering 
golimumab,  including  those  patients  with  a  past  history  of  latent  TB  in  whom  an  adequate 
course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving golimumab should be monitored 
closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment (SmPC Section 4.4 
[Special warnings and precautions for use]).
Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
All patients should be screened for HBV infection prior to initiation of SIMPONI. In patients 
who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise 
in  the  treatment  of  HBV  infection  is  recommended.  Chronic  carriers of  HBV  should  be 
appropriately  evaluated  and  monitored  prior  to  initiation  of,  during  treatment  with,  and  for 
several months following discontinuation of SIMPONI (SmPC Section 4.4 [Special warnings 
and precautions for use]).
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The observed incidence of serious infections has not had a significant impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product. Risk minimization measures are in place and considered adequate and 
proportionate to the risk; the SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber and patient 
on how to manage this important identified risk. In addition, the safety concern is addressed in 
the Patient Reminder Card.
Public Health Impact:
The  public  health  impact  of  the  development  of  serious  infections  during  treatment  with 
SIMPONI is not known.
73
Important Identified Risk: Demyelinating Disorders
Potential Mechanisms:
The role that TNFα plays as an immunomodulator suggests that TNFα blockade may promote 
the  development  of  drug-induced  neuropathies  by  augmenting  the  number  of  activated 
peripheral T cells and thereby enhancing autoimmune responses by altering antigen presenting 
cell function, potentiating T-cell receptor signaling, and/or decreasing apoptosis of autoreactive 
T cells. These autoreactive T cells might also drive the maturation of B cells into cells secreting 
autoantibodies to neuronal-specific antigens (Stübgen 2008).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Demyelinating  disorders  (both  central  and  peripheral)  have  been  associated  with  the  use  of 
TNFα inhibitors. 
SIMPONI  has  been  investigated  in  multiple  settings.  Demyelinating  disorders  have  been 
reported in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with SIMPONI. 
Demyelinating disorders are considered an important identified risk because of the consistency 
of evidence across multiple sources, including data from products in the same class. 
Characterization of the Risk - Data
In the Phase 3 pJIA trial (CNTO148JIA3001), one event of serious demyelination was reported 
for a subject on Day 770. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering/resolving. 
Events that were reported in RA, PsA, AS, nr-AxSpA, asthma, and UC trials are summarized 
in the tables below.

Characterization of the Risk – Discussion:
Demyelinating  disorders  are  considered  a  class  effect  for  anti-TNFα  agents.  Demyelinating 
disorders are listed in the SIMPONI SmPC (Section 4.4 [Special warnings and precautions for 
use] and Section 4.8 [Undesirable effects]). 
In the All Randomized Blinded Trials Population of All Trials with SIMPONI, the frequency 
of demyelinating disorders was <0.1% for  golimumab-treated subjects compared with 0.0%
for those who received placebo or comparator. 
Postmarketing data are consistent with what is currently known about the risk of demyelinating 
disorders in patients treated with SIMPONI. A 5-year trending analysis, covering the period 
07 April  2018  to  28 February  2023,  of  the  RR  of  spontaneously  reported  cases  of 
demyelinating  disorders  in  patients  exposed  to  SC  SIMPONI  showed  the  RR  has  been 
decreasing. Four cases involving the IV route of administration of SIMPONI were identified 
during the 5-year reporting period. Based on review of data in the PBRER/PSUR (data lock 
point: 06 April 2023), no new safety information has been identified for the important identified 
risk of demyelinating disorders. 
The impact of this risk on the individual patient can vary from minimal to significant. Patients 
with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disorders may have a more severe course 
due to use of the product. This risk needs to be carefully weighed against the benefit conferred 
by use of the medication.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  and  other  autoimmune  diseases  have  been  linked  to  genetic  and 
environmental factors. First-degree relatives of MS patients are at greater risk of developing 
MS  than  the  general  population  (Didonna 2015).  Whites,  particularly  of  northern  European 
descent, are also more likely to develop MS (Ascherio 2016).
Several  studies  have  suggested  an  association  between  smoking  and  MS  (Ascherio 2016).
Obesity in early life and Epstein-Barr virus have also been identified as risk factors for MS 
(Ascherio 2016). 
Preventability:
Predictability and preventability of the development of demyelination is not known. In patients 
with  pre-existing  or  recent  onset  of  demyelinating  disorders,  the  benefits  and  risks  of 
anti-TNFα agents should be carefully considered before initiation of SIMPONI therapy (SmPC 
Section 4.4 [Special warnings and precautions for use]).
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Demyelinating  disorders  is  an  unusual  risk  that  is  being  evaluated  in  ongoing  additional 
pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. Risk minimization measures are in place and considered 
adequate and proportionate to the risk. The SmPC and PL provide information to the prescriber 
and patient on how to manage this important identified risk. 
Public Health Impact:
The public health impact of the development of demyelinating disorders during treatment with 
SIMPONI is not known.
78
Important Identified Risk: Malignancy
As  part  of  the  broad  term  of  malignancy,  information  relating  to  specific  subtypes  of 
malignancy (lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma [HSTCL], skin cancer, and leukemia) 
are  described  in  this  section  of  the  RMP.  These  subtypes  are  identified  as  ADRs  in  the 
SIMPONI SmPC and were previously listed as important identified risks (Lymphoma, Skin 
cancer, and Leukemia) and an important potential risk (Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma) in the 
SIMPONI RMP.
Potential Mechanisms:
Immunomodulation by TNFα may be important in tumor surveillance, although the literature 
is not consistent on this point (Torre-Amione 1996). While TNFα was shown to exert cytotoxic 
and/or cytostatic effects on a number of human and murine tumor cell lines, some malignant 
cell lines are TNFα-resistant  or even proliferate in the presence of  low levels of  TNFα and 
TNFα  may  behave  as  a  tumor  promoter  particularly  in  the  setting  of  unresolved,  chronic 
inflammation (Balkwill 2006). Therefore, the effects attributed to TNFα in published medical 
literature suggesting that certain types  of  malignancies may be adversely affected by TNFα 
blockade may apply to SIMPONI. 
Of note, HSTCL is a rare and rapidly progressive subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and 
has been reported following TNFα-blocker therapy. Most patients who developed HSTCL were 
adolescent or young adult males. Almost all these patients had also received azathioprine or 
6-mercaptopurine. Hypothetical mechanisms include (1) inhibition of TNF signaling resulting 
in impaired immune surveillance particularly affecting the detection and elimination of cells 
with chromosomal abnormalities resulting from azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy and 
(2) alterations in azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine metabolism in patients receiving anti-TNF 
therapy (Shale 2008).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Reports of malignancies in golimumab-treated subjects, including lymphoma, skin cancer, and 
leukemia, have been received in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. 
For  non-lymphoma  malignancies  (excluding  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer [NMSC]),  the 
incidence was similar between the golimumab and the control groups in the controlled portions 
of the golimumab pivotal trials and through approximately 4 years of follow-up. The incidence 
was also similar to the incidence in the general population. 
For lymphoma, more cases have been observed among patients receiving anti-TNFα treatment 
compared with control patients in the controlled portions of clinical trials of all TNFα-blocking 
agents, including golimumab (Geborek 2005; Bongartz 2006). However, there is an increased 
background risk for lymphoma in RA patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory 
disease,  which  complicates  risk  estimation  (Wolfe 2004;  Hemminki 2008a; Hyrich 2018). 
During the golimumab Phase 2b and 3 SC clinical trials in RA, PsA, and AS, the incidence of 
lymphoma in golimumab-treated subjects was higher than expected compared to the general 
population. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of these trials with a median follow-up 
of  up  to  3 years,  a  greater  incidence  of  lymphoma  was  observed  in  patients  receiving 
golimumab 100 mg compared with patients receiving golimumab 50 mg.
79
Looking  specifically  at  children,  adolescents,  and  young  adults  (up  to  22  years  of  age), 
postmarketing cases of malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in patients who received 
TNFα inhibitors (initiation of therapy ≤18 years of age) to treat JIA, Crohn’s disease, or other 
conditions.  Approximately  half  the  reports  were  lymphomas.  The  other  cases  represented  a 
variety of different malignancies and included malignancies that are not usually observed in 
children  and  adolescents.  Most  of 
receiving  concomitant 
immunosuppressants, such as MTX, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine. It is not clear whether 
children  with  certain  autoimmune  conditions  have  an  increased  risk  for  malignancy  given 
limited data (Hemminki 2008b).
the  patients  were 
For HSTCL, there have been rare reports in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with 
other TNFα inhibitors. 
The development of malignancy is considered an important identified risk because the effects 
attributed  to  TNFα  in  published  medical  literature,  suggesting  that  certain types  of 
malignancies may be adversely affected by TNFα blockade, may apply to SIMPONI. 
Characterization of the Risk - Data:
Data  for  malignancies  are  presented  in  the  tables  below  and  grouped  in  the  following 
subcategories:  malignancies (excluding  lymphoma,  skin  cancer,  and  leukemia),  lymphoma, 
skin  cancer  (NMSC and  melanoma  skin  cancer),  and  leukemia.  No  events  of  HSTCL  were 
reported and therefore no tables are presented for this subcategory.
In  the  Phase  3  pJIA  trial  (CNTO148JIA3001),  no  events  of  malignancy  were  reported  and 
therefore no tables for this pediatric study are included in this section.

Characterization of the Risk – Discussion:
The risk of malignancy is addressed in the SIMPONI SmPC (Section 4.4 [Special warnings 
and  precautions  for  use]  and/or Section  4.8  [Undesirable  effects]) and  certain  subtypes  of 
malignancies are listed as ADRs.
In the All Randomized, Blinded Trials Population of All Trials with SIMPONI, the frequencies
of certain types of malignancies were as follows:
 Malignancies 
(excluding 
for 
golimumab-treated  subjects  compared  with  0.3%  for  those  who  received  placebo  or 
comparator.
lymphoma,  skin  cancer,  and 
leukemia):  0.2% 



Lymphoma (excluding HSTCL): <0.1% for  golimumab-treated subjects compared with 
0.0% for those who received placebo or comparator.
Skin cancer:
 Nonmelanoma  skin  cancer:  <0.2%  for  golimumab-treated  subjects  compared  with 
0.3% for those who received placebo or comparator.
 Melanoma skin cancer: 0.0% for golimumab-treated subjects compared with 0.0% for 
those who received placebo or comparator.
Leukemia:  0.0%  for  golimumab-treated  subjects  compared  with  0.0%  for  those  who 
received placebo or comparator.
In the postmarketing setting, 5-year trending analyses (07 April 2018 to 28 February 2023) of 
spontaneously reported cases have shown the following:
 Malignancies  (excluding  lymphoma,  HSTCL,  skin  cancer,  and  leukemia):  overall 
downward trend of the RR in patients exposed to SC SIMPONI and overall downward
trend of the RR in patients exposed to IV SIMPONI.



Lymphoma (excluding HSTCL): overall downward trend of the RR in patients exposed to 
SC SIMPONI. The low number of cases received for IV administration (6) was insufficient 
to identify a trend.
Skin  cancer:  overall  downward  trend  of  the  RR  in  patients  exposed  to IV  and SC 
SIMPONI. 
Leukemia:  overall downward  trend  in  RR  of  spontaneously  reported  cases  in  patients 
exposed to SC SIMPONI. Two cases were reported in patients exposed to IV SIMPONI 
during the same reporting period.
No  cases  of  HSTCL  have  been identified  in  clinical  trials  or  the  postmarketing  setting  for 
SIMPONI through 28 February 2023.
In summary, postmarketing data for malignancies are consistent with what is currently known 
about the risk of malignancies in patients treated with SIMPONI. Based on review of data in 
the  PBRER/PSUR  (data  lock  point: 06  April  2023),  no  new  safety  information  has  been 
identified for this important identified risk. 
The impact of this risk on the individual patient is potentially significant, particularly in patients 
with an existing malignancy, a history of malignancy, or significant risk factors for malignancy 
such as a history of heavy smoking.
96
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Because disease severity, cumulative disease activity, and disease duration may also contribute 
to an increased risk of malignancy in patients with immune-mediated diseases, it is difficult to 
distinguish the individual contribution of immunosuppressive medications, including those like 
SIMPONI  that  inhibit  TNFα,  from  other  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  malignancy 
(Jones 1996; Tennis 1993; Silman 1988). This is further complicated by the fact that patients 
with severe disease are more likely to have been treated with one or more immunosuppressive 
medications.
There are a number of conflicting studies related to the risk of malignancies with the use of 
MTX. A retrospective analysis of 16,263 RA patients registered at the Mayo Clinic between 
1976 and 1992 showed no relationship between the development of malignancy and the dose 
or duration of MTX compared with any other DMARD (Moder 1995).
Information regarding additional risk factors for the malignancy subtypes included in the broad 
category of malignancy is given below.
Lymphoma

(due 
to  medications 
family  history, 
immunosuppression 
Lymphoma:  Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  lymphoma  include  older  age,  male 
gender,
[such  as 
immunosuppression  for  organ  transplants,  chemotherapy  for  cancer  or  treatment  for 
autoimmune  diseases],  infection  with  HIV, or  from  immune  deficiencies  due  to  an
inherited  syndrome),  autoimmune  diseases  with  chronic  inflammation  (RA,  systemic 
lupus  erythematosus,  Sjögren’s syndrome,  celiac  disease),  infections  that  directly 
transform  lymphocytes  (human  T-cell  lymphotropic  virus,  Epstein-Barr  virus,  human 
herpes virus  8), infections  that cause chronic immune stimulation (Helicobacter pylori, 
Chlamydophila psittaci,  Campylobacter  jejuni,  chronic  hepatitis  C  infection),  radiation 
exposure,
to  certain  chemicals  among  others  (Baecklund 2006; 
Smedby 2006; Hartge 2007; Cerhan 2014; American Cancer Society, 2018).
and  exposure 
 Hepatosplenic  T-cell  lymphoma:  young  men,  the  immunocompromised,  and  patients 
undergoing  solid  organ  transplantation  appear  to  be  at  a  higher  risk  for  HSTCL 
(Belhadj 2003).
Skin Cancer
 Melanoma:  Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  melanomas  can  be  categorized  as 
environmental or host  factors. Exposure  to ultraviolet (UV)  light, especially in patients 
with a fair complexion, history of sunburns, and poor ability to tan, is the most strongly 
correlated  environmental  risk  factor  with  the  development  of  melanoma.  Patients  with 
xeroderma  pigmentosum  who  do  not  have  the  ability  to  repair  UV  light-induced  DNA 
damage are particularly susceptible. Family or personal history of melanoma and/or certain 
gene  mutations  are  strong  host  risk  factors.  Additional  host  risk  factors  include  the 
presence of 5 or more dysplastic nevi, a large number of nevi, and giant congenital nevus. 
Patients  with  conditions  that  are  associated  with  immune  suppression  (ie,  HIV,  organ 
transplantation)  are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  melanomas  (American  Cancer 
Society, 2016).
97
 Nonmelanoma skin cancer: The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) include 
chronic  UV  light  exposure  (UVA  and  UVB),  increasing  age,  arsenic  exposure,  genetic 
predisposition, therapeutic radiation exposure, and immunosuppression. The risk factors 
for  basal  cell  carcinoma  include  all  those  for  SCC  in  addition  to  basal  cell  nervous 
syndrome  (Wrone 2011).  With respect to patients with RA,  epidemiological trials have
generally  shown  that  skin  cancers  are  increased  in  this  group,  and  immunosuppression 
may  potentiate  this  risk  by  shortening  the  time  taken  to  develop  a  malignancy 
(Wolfe 2007). With respect to psoriasis patients, a higher risk of NMSC is seen in those 
with prior coal tar, UVB therapy, psoralen plus  UVA light, retinoids, and cyclosporine 
therapy (Stern 1998; Nijsten 2003; Curtin 2005).
 Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC): Although the cause of MCC remains unclear, risk factors 
associated with its development include exposure to UV radiation, immunosuppression, 
and possibly viral causes. Most MCCs are located on sun exposed areas, particularly the 
head and neck, extremities, and trunk. Merkel cell carcinoma occurs most frequently in 
elderly  white  patients  and  affects males  more  commonly  than  females  (Duprat 2011; 
Wang 2011). Immunosuppression increases the risk of MCC in patients with HIV and in 
solid organ  transplant  patients.  Patients  with  other  tumors,  such  as  SCC  and  chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, also have an increased risk of MCC (Wang 2011).
Leukemia

Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  leukemia  include  genetic  abnormalities,  family 
history, 
radiation  exposure,  chemotherapy,  autoimmune  diseases  with  chronic 
inflammation and exposure to certain chemicals among others (Choi 2014; Elbæk 2016).
Preventability:
Predictability  and  preventability  of  the  development  of  malignancy  is  not  known.  Caution 
should  be  exercised  when  considering  the  use  of  SIMPONI  in  patients  with  a  history  of 
malignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy 
(SmPC Section 4.4 [Special warnings and precautions for use]).
For  skin  cancer,  specific  preventive measures  can  be  taken  such  as  limiting  sun  exposure, 
especially  in  the  middle  of  the  day  (between  the  hours  of  10  am  and  4  pm).  Also,  use  of 
sunscreen,  protective  clothing,  and  hats  are  recommended  to  limit  exposure  to  UV  light. 
Periodic skin examinations are recommended for all patients, particularly for patients with risk 
factors for skin cancer.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The  observed  incidence  of  malignancy  (including  lymphoma,  HSTCL,  skin  cancer  and 
leukemia)  has  not  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  It  is 
expected that the risk of malignancy will be further characterized by the PV activities outlined 
in  this  RMP.  Leukemia  is  well  characterized  and  based  upon  the  small  number  of  events 
reported  to  date,  there  is  limited  possibility  of  further  characterization.  Risk minimization 
measures are in place and considered adequate and proportionate to the risk; the SmPC and PL 
provide information to the prescriber and patient on how to manage the important identified
risk of malignancy.
Public Health Impact:
The public health impact of the development of malignancy during treatment with SIMPONI 
is not known.
98
Important Potential Risk: Serious Depression Including Suicidality
Potential Mechanisms:
The exact biological mechanism of depression is not known. Cytokines may be involved with 
serotonin metabolism (Dantzer 1999). More specifically, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
TNFα are associated with major depression; reducing the effect of these cytokines may reverse 
depressive symptoms (Tyring 2006). The mechanism by which SIMPONI could affect mood 
is not known.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
SIMPONI  has  been  investigated  in  multiple  settings.  In  clinical  trials,  serious  depression 
including suicidality has been reported in patients treated with SIMPONI. Depression has also 
been reported in the postmarketing setting and is described in published medical literature. 
Although  serious  depression  has  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  SIMPONI,  a  causal
association between the development or worsening of serious depression (including suicidality) 
and SIMPONI has not been established. Complicating the assessment is evidence that patients 
with RA, AS, and PsA have increased rates of depression compared to the general population
(Isik 2007; Sundquist 2008; Kotsis 2012). Additionally, while some researchers have found no 
evidence of an association between depression and UC, others have suggested that depression 
and anxiety are common in patients with IBD (Sajadinejad 2012; Román 2011).
Characterization of the Risk – Data:
Events  that  were  reported  in  RA,  PsA,  AS,  nr-AxSpA,  asthma,  UC,  and  pJIA  trials  are

103
Characterization of the Risk – Discussion:
In the All Randomized, Blinded Trials Population of All Trials with SIMPONI, the frequency of 
serious depression (including suicidality)  was <0.1%  for  golimumab-treated subjects compared 
with 0.0% for those who received placebo or comparator.
Postmarketing data are consistent with what is currently known about the risk of serious depression 
(including suicidality) in patients treated with SIMPONI. A 5-year trending analysis, covering the 
period 07 April 2018 to 28 February 2023, of the RR of spontaneously reported cases of serious 
depression (including suicidality) in patients exposed to SC SIMPONI showed a downward trend. 
Three cases of serious depression (including suicidality) involving the IV route of administration 
of SIMPONI was identified during the 5-year reporting period. Based on review of data in the 
PBRER/PSUR (data lock point: 06 April 2023), no new safety information has been identified for 
the important identified risk of serious depression (including suicidality). Depression is listed in 
the SIMPONI SmPC (Section 4.8 [Undesirable effects]).
The impact of this risk on the individual patient can vary from minimal to considerable. This risk 
needs to be carefully weighed against the benefit conferred by use of the medication.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk  factors  for  depression  include  older  age  and  associated  neurologic  conditions,  recent 
childbirth, stressful life events, a personal or family history of depression, and selected medical 
comorbid conditions. Suicide rates are twice as high in families of suicide victims (Fancher 2007).
Preventability:
There is no known means of preventing depression. There are screening tools available to identify 
patients with depression. Patients with a history of untreated or inadequately treated depression 
should be treated for such.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
The  observed  incidence  of  serious  depression,  including  suicidality  has  not  had  a  significant 
impact  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  safety  concern  is  being  evaluated  in  an 
ongoing  additional  PV activity,  and  routine  risk  minimization  measures  that  are  considered 
adequate and proportionate to the risk are in place.
Public Health Impact:
The public health impact of the development of serious depression (including suicidality) during 
treatment with SIMPONI is not known.
104
Important Potential Risk: Breakthrough infection after administration of live 
vaccines in infants exposed to golimumab in utero
Potential Mechanisms:
Following treatment with a TNFα-blocking mAb during pregnancy, the antibody was detected for 
up to 6 months in the serum of the infant born to the treated woman. Because TNFα inhibitors 
reduce the immune response, administration of a TNFα inhibitor during pregnancy may predispose 
infants to breakthrough infections when receiving live (attenuated) vaccines within 6 months after 
birth. It is known that SIMPONI crosses the placenta during pregnancy and so this risk may also 
apply to SIMPONI.
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence:
A  small  number  of  cases  of  breakthrough  infection  have  occurred  after  administration  of  live 
vaccines  in  infants  exposed  to  another  TNFα-blocking  agent  in utero (REMICADE  SmPC 
Section 4.4). A  cumulative  search  of  the  postmarketing  safety  database  from  launch  through 
28 February 2023 did not identify any cases of breakthrough infections following administration 
of live (attenuated) vaccines in infants born to women who received SIMPONI. Additionally, no 
cases have been identified in SIMPONI clinical trials. 
Characterization of the Risk – Data and Discussion:
There  have  been  no  reported  cases  of  breakthrough  infections  following  administration  of  live 
(attenuated) vaccines in infants born to women who received SIMPONI in clinical trials or in the 
postmarketing setting from launch through 28 February 2023.
Women  who  were  pregnant,  nursing,  or  planning  a  pregnancy  were  excluded  from  SIMPONI
clinical trials. In addition, if a woman became pregnant while participating in a clinical trial, the 
study agent was discontinued.
Breakthrough  infection  after  administration  of  live  (attenuated)  vaccines  in  infants  exposed  to 
TNFα  inhibitors  in utero, including  SIMPONI, is  considered  a  class  effect.  It  is  considered  an 
important potential risk because the impact of this risk is potentially significant. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Infants exposed to SIMPONI in utero and who receive live (attenuated) vaccines within 6 months 
after birth may be at risk for developing breakthrough infection.
Preventability:
Administration  of  live  (attenuated)  vaccines  to  infants  exposed  to  SIMPONI  in utero is  not 
recommended  for  6  months  following  the  mother's  last  SIMPONI  injection  during  pregnancy
(SmPC Section 4.6 [Fertility, pregnancy and lactation]). The risk of breakthrough infection after 
administration of live vaccines in infants exposed to golimumab in utero is described in the Patient 
Reminder Card (see Part V.2).
105
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
As  there  are  no  reported  cases  through  28 February 2023,  breakthrough  infection  after 
administration of live (attenuated) vaccines in infants with in utero exposure to SIMPONI has not 
had a significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product. Risk minimization measures 
are in place and  considered adequate and proportionate  to the risk; the SmPC, PL,  and Patient
Reminder Card provide information to the prescriber and patient on how to manage this important 
potential risk.
Public Health Impact:
The potential public health impact is not known.

SVII.3.2.
Presentation of the Missing Information
Missing information: Long-term safety in pediatric patients
Evidence source: Comorbidities of patients with pJIA differ from those of non-pJIA patients and 
therefore the long-term safety profile of golimumab in patients with pJIA may differ from that in other 
indications.
A relatively small number of children ≥2 to <18 years of age (173) were exposed to golimumab in the 
pJIA trial CNTO148JIA3001, in which the average duration of follow-up for randomized subjects was 
107 weeks. Although no risks of clinical significance were identified in golimumab-treated subjects,
the effect of long-term treatment with golimumab in this patient population has not been studied.
Population in need of further characterization: Pediatric patients ≥2 years of age who have been treated 
with SIMPONI long term. An observational postauthorization safety study (PASS) to investigate the 
long-term safety of golimumab in pJIA subjects using the German Biologics JIA Registry (BiKeR), in 
which patients are followed for up to 5 years, is ongoing.

V.2.
Additional Risk Minimization Measures
Additional Risk Minimization Activity: Patient Reminder Card
Objectives:
Rationale for the additional risk 
minimization activity:
The goal of the Patient Reminder Card is to educate patients on 
important safety information that they need to be aware of 
before and during treatment with SIMPONI.
The Patient Reminder Card addresses the following important 
risks:


Serious infections (including opportunistic infections, 
tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus reactivation)
Breakthrough infection after administration of live 
vaccines in infants exposed to golimumab in utero
To enhance patient knowledge regarding the risk of infection 
associated with SIMPONI treatment and to remind patients 
who received SIMPONI during pregnancy to inform their 
infant’s physician before the infant receives any live vaccine.
Target audience and planned 
distribution path:
The Patient Reminder Card is provided as part of the product 
packaging. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for SIMPONI (golimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for SIMPONI. The RMP details important 
risks of SIMPONI, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about SIMPONI’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
SIMPONI’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how SIMPONI should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for SIMPONI should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of SIMPONI’s
RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
SIMPONI is authorized for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), nonradiographic 
axial  spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA),  ankylosing  spondylitis (AS), ulcerative  colitis (UC), and 
polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis (JIA)  (pJIA) (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It 
contains golimumab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous (SC) injection using a 
prefilled syringe, prefilled pen, and pediatric prefilled pen.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  SIMPONI’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  SIMPONI’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA)

Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks  of  SIMPONI, together with measures  to minimize such  risks  and the proposed 
studies for learning more about SIMPONI’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use included in the 
PL addressed to patients and the SmPC addressed to HCPs;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a single pack which is chosen to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or without 
prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
117
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of SIMPONI, these measures are supplemented with the additional risk minimization
measure mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including in Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports/Periodic Safety Update 
Reports assessments so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of SIMPONI is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important  risks  of  SIMPONI are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to further 
investigate or minimize the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can be regarded as  identified or  potential.  Identified risks  are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  SIMPONI.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B.
Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk: Serious infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Because they suppress the immune system, drugs that inhibit 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been associated with an 
increased risk of serious infections (some fatal), including 
opportunistic infections, tuberculosis (TB), and invasive fungal 
infections. Drugs that inhibit TNFα have also been associated with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients who are chronic 
carriers of the virus. 
Serious infections, including opportunistic infections and TB, have 
been reported in patients treated with SIMPONI in clinical trials 
and in the postmarketing setting. Hepatitis B virus reactivation has 
been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with 
SIMPONI. These findings are consistent with nonclinical data and 
published medical literature.
Serious infections is considered an important identified risk 
because of the consistency of evidence across multiple sources, 
including data from products in the same class. 
Risk factors and risk groups
Serious infections
Risk factors for the development of serious infections include the 
use of steroids, other immunosuppressive drugs (including 
methotrexate [MTX]), or other biologics at the same time as 
SIMPONI.
Opportunistic infections
People whose immune status is compromised are susceptible to 
opportunistic infections. Risk factors for opportunistic infections 
may therefore include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
disease, increased age, having an organ transplant, 
immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids, MTX, 
azathioprine, and biologic agents), chronic pulmonary disease, and 
chronic renal failure.
Invasive fungal infections
People who have resided in or traveled to regions where invasive 
fungal infections are common are at increased risk.
Tuberculosis
The most common risk factors for the development of TB include 
conditions that weaken the immune system such as advanced age, 
HIV infection, alcohol abuse, malignancy, corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive drugs such as MTX, connective tissue disease, 
renal failure, diabetes, and pregnancy.
Other risk factors for the development of TB include contact with a 
person with active TB infection and having been born in, lived in, 
or traveled to countries where the incidence of TB is high. 
Exposure to TB may occur through various health care settings 
(eg, hospitals and nursing homes) or high-density institutions 
(eg, prisons).
Hepatitis B Virus reactivation 
119
Important Identified Risk: Serious infections 
Risk factors for the acquisition of HBV include being born to a 
mother from a highly endemic area, emigration from a highly 
endemic area, history of intravenous drug use, and a history of 
multiple sexual partners. Patients at risk for HBV reactivation are 
those who are chronic carriers of this virus (ie, surface antigen-
positive), especially those who become immunosuppressed. 
Approximately 14% to 50% of immunosuppressed patients who 
are chronic carriers of HBV will experience acute reactivations 
during the natural history of their disease. Thus, risk factors for 
HBV reactivation in patients with a history of HBV infection 
include the concomitant use of medications that suppress the 
immune system (eg, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, MTX, 
azathioprine, TNFα inhibitors). Other risk factors that may 
contribute to HBV reactivation include HIV infection, 
transplantation (especially bone marrow), and withdrawal from 
immunosuppressive therapies.

Important Identified Risk: Demyelinating disorders
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Demyelinating disorders (both central and peripheral) have been 
associated with the use of TNFα inhibitors. 
Risk factors and risk groups
SIMPONI has been investigated in multiple settings. 
Demyelinating disorders have been reported in clinical trials and in 
the postmarketing setting in patients treated with SIMPONI. 
Demyelinating disorders are considered an important identified 
risk because of the consistency of evidence across multiple 
sources, including data from products in the same class. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases have been 
linked to genetic and environmental factors. First-degree relatives 
of MS patients are at greater risk of developing MS than the 
general population. Whites, particularly of northern European 
descent, are also more likely to develop MS.
Several studies have suggested an association between smoking 
and MS. Obesity in early life and Epstein-Barr virus have also 
been identified as risk factors for MS.

Important Identified Risk: Malignancy
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Reports of malignancies in golimumab-treated subjects, including 
reports of lymphoma, skin cancer, and leukemia, have been 
received during clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting.
For non-lymphoma malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin 
cancer [NMSC]), the incidence was similar between the 
golimumab and the control groups in the controlled portions of the 
golimumab pivotal trials and through approximately 4 years of 
follow-up. The incidence was also similar to the incidence in the 
general population.
For lymphoma, more cases have been observed among patients 
receiving anti-TNFα treatment compared with control patients in 
the controlled portions of clinical trials of all TNFα-blocking 
agents, including golimumab. However, there is an increased 
background risk for lymphoma in RA patients with long-standing, 
highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk 
estimation. During the golimumab Phase 2b and 3 SC clinical 
trials in RA, PsA, and AS, the incidence of lymphoma in 
121
Important Identified Risk: Malignancy
Risk factors and risk groups
golimumab-treated subjects was higher than expected compared to 
the general population. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions 
of these trials with a median follow-up of up to 3 years, a greater 
incidence of lymphoma was observed in patients receiving 
golimumab 100 mg compared with patients receiving golimumab 
50 mg.
Looking specifically at children, adolescents, and young adults (up 
to 22 years of age), postmarketing cases of malignancies, some 
fatal, have been reported in patients who received TNFα inhibitors 
(initiation of therapy ≤18 years of age) to treat JIA, Crohn’s 
disease, or other conditions. Approximately half the reports were 
lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different 
malignancies and included malignancies that are not usually 
observed in children and adolescents. Most of the patients were 
receiving concomitant immunosuppressants, such as MTX, 
azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine. It is not clear whether children 
with certain autoimmune conditions have an increased risk for 
malignancy given limited data.
For hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), there have been rare 
reports in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with other 
TNFα inhibitors. 
The development of malignancy is considered an important 
identified risk because the effects attributed to TNFα in published 
medical literature, suggesting that certain types of malignancies 
may be adversely affected by TNFα blockade, may apply to 
SIMPONI.
Because disease severity, cumulative disease activity, and disease 
duration may also contribute to an increased risk of malignancy in 
patients with immune-mediated diseases, it is difficult to 
distinguish the individual contribution of immunosuppressive 
medications, including those like SIMPONI that inhibit TNFα, 
from other risk factors for the development of malignancy. This is 
further complicated by the fact that patients with severe disease are 
more likely to have been treated with one or more 
immunosuppressive medications. 
There are a number of conflicting studies related to the risk of 
malignancies with the use of MTX. A retrospective analysis of 
16,263 RA patients registered at the Mayo Clinic between 1976
and 1992 showed no relationship between the development of 
malignancy and the dose or duration of MTX compared with any 
other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug.
Information regarding additional risk factors for the malignancy 
subtypes included in the broad category of malignancy is given 
below.
Lymphoma 
Lymphoma: Risk factors for the development of lymphoma 
include older age, male gender, family history, 
immunosuppression (due to medications [such as 
122
Important Identified Risk: Malignancy
immunosuppression for organ transplants, chemotherapy for 
cancer or treatment for autoimmune diseases], infection with HIV, 
or from immune deficiencies due to an inherited syndrome), 
autoimmune diseases with chronic inflammation (RA, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, celiac disease), infections 
that directly transform lymphocytes (human T-cell lymphotropic 
virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 8), infections that 
cause chronic immune stimulation (Helicobacter pylori, 
Chlamydophila psittaci, Campylobacter jejuni, chronic hepatitis C 
infection), radiation exposure, and exposure to certain chemicals 
among others.
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: young men, the 
immunocompromised, and patients undergoing solid organ 
transplantation appear to be at a higher risk for HSTCL.
Skin Cancer
Melanoma: Risk factors for the development of melanomas can be 
categorized as environmental or host factors. Exposure to 
ultraviolet (UV) light, especially in patients with a fair 
complexion, history of sunburns, and poor ability to tan, is the 
most strongly correlated environmental risk factor with the 
development of melanoma. Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum 
who do not have the ability to repair UV light-induced 
deoxyribonucleic acid damage are particularly susceptible. Family 
or personal history of melanoma and/or certain gene mutations are 
strong host risk factors. Additional host risk factors include the 
presence of 5 or more dysplastic nevi, a large number of nevi, and 
giant congenital nevus. Patients with conditions that are associated 
with immune suppression (ie, HIV, organ transplantation) are at 
higher risk of developing melanomas. 
Nonmelanoma skin cancer: The risk factors for squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) include chronic UV light exposure (UVA and 
UVB), increasing age, arsenic exposure, genetic predisposition, 
therapeutic radiation exposure, and immunosuppression. The risk 
factors for basal cell carcinoma include all those for SCC in 
addition to basal cell nervous syndrome. With respect to patients 
with RA, epidemiological trials have generally shown that skin 
cancers are increased in this group, and immunosuppression may 
potentiate this risk by shortening the time taken to develop a 
malignancy. With respect to psoriasis patients, a higher risk of 
NMSC is seen in those with prior coal tar, UVB therapy, psoralen 
plus UVA light therapy, retinoids, and cyclosporine therapy.
123
Important Identified Risk: Malignancy
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC): Although the cause of MCC 
remains unclear, risk factors associated with its development 
include exposure to UV radiation, immunosuppression, and 
possibly viral causes. Most MCCs are located on sun exposed 
areas, particularly the head and neck, extremities, and trunk. 
Merkel cell carcinoma occurs most frequently in elderly white 
patients and affects males more commonly than females. 
Immunosuppression increases the risk of MCC in patients with 
HIV and in solid organ transplant patients. Patients with other 
tumors, such as SCC and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, also have 
an increased risk of MCC.
Leukemia
Risk factors for the development of leukemia include genetic 
abnormalities, family history, radiation exposure, chemotherapy, 
autoimmune diseases with chronic inflammation and exposure to 
certain chemicals among others.

Important Potential Risk: Serious depression including suicidality
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
SIMPONI has been investigated in multiple settings. In clinical 
trials, serious depression including suicidality has been reported in 
patients treated with SIMPONI. Depression has also been reported 
in the postmarketing setting and is described in published medical 
literature.
Although serious depression has been reported in patients treated 
with SIMPONI, a causal association between the development or 
worsening of serious depression (including suicidality) and 
SIMPONI has not been established. Complicating the assessment 
is evidence that patients with RA, AS, and PsA have increased 
rates of depression compared to the general population. 
Additionally, while some researchers have found no evidence of an 
association between depression and UC, others have suggested that 
depression and anxiety are common in patients with inflammatory 
bowel disease.
Risk factors for depression include older age and associated 
neurologic conditions, recent childbirth, stressful life events, a 
personal or family history of depression, and selected medical 
comorbid conditions. Suicide rates are twice as high in families of 
suicide victims.

Important Potential Risk: Breakthrough infection after administration of live vaccines in infants 
exposed to golimumab in utero
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
A small number of cases of breakthrough infection have occurred 
after administration of live vaccines in infants exposed to another 
TNFα-blocking agent in utero. A cumulative search of the 
postmarketing safety database from launch through 
28 February 2023 did not identify any cases of breakthrough 
infections following administration of live (attenuated) vaccines in 
infants born to women who received SIMPONI. Additionally, no 
cases have been identified in SIMPONI clinical trials. 
Infants exposed to SIMPONI in utero and who receive live 
(attenuated) vaccines within 6 months after birth may be at risk for 
developing breakthrough infection.

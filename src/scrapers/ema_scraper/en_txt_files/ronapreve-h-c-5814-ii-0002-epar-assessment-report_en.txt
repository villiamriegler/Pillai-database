SARS-CoV-2 is a novel ribonucleic acid (RNA) betacoronavirus initially identified from patients 
experiencing atypical pneumonia in Wuhan City, China (Zhu, 2020). 
Page 6/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or it may cause a wide spectrum of illness, ranging 
from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and 
multiple organ failure (Wiersinga et al. 2020). Severe/critical COVID-19 is associated with high 
mortality and places extensive burdens on hospital resources including high dependency and intensive 
care units (ICU) to provide mechanical ventilation and other advanced forms of life support (Guan et 
al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg.  
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been categorized as a pandemic 
by the WHO since March 2020, which has resulted in approximately 767,750,853 cumulative cases 
globally with more than 2.2 million deaths reported across the EU region (https://covid19.who.int / 
last accessed June 2023). There have been approximately 276 million cases in Europe with 6.9 million 
cumulative deaths reported globally. 
The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit relatively mild symptoms or are 
asymptomatic (Hu, 2020; Oran et al. 2020), especially considering the widespread vaccination efforts 
and high efficacy of currently available vaccines. However, vaccines are not 100% effective and there 
have been reports of breakthrough infections that result in hospitalization. Although it is expected that 
the majority of breakthrough infections are likely to be mild to moderate, those considered high risk or 
those coming to the end of their vaccine immunity remain susceptible to severe disease. Furthermore, 
those that choose not to be vaccinated remain at risk with higher levels of morbidity and mortality. 
As of 20 April 2023, following ECDC data, in EU/EEA countries, approximately, 75.6% of the population 
has received at least 1 dose of vaccine against COVID-19 and 54.8% a first booster, leaving around 
24.4 % population unvaccinated. https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-
19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab 
Biologic features 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the viral transmembrane spike glycoprotein to 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. The receptor binding domain of 
the spike glycoprotein is, consequently, the main target for neutralising antibodies. 
Studies among hospitalized patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby et al. 2020) (Westblade et al. 2020). 
Community-based studies in non-hospitalized patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral 
load across both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung et al. 2021). 
Natural history observations of COVID-19 in the placebo arm across all studies in the Ronapreve 
clinical development program demonstrate that the burden of disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection 
is associated with high viral load (initial MAA, Module 2.7.3). This association has been reported 
repeatedly throughout the pandemic, with numerous studies showing the strong association between 
high viral load and worse outcomes for infectivity, disease phenotype, morbidity and mortality 
(Magleby et al. 2020) (Néant et al. 2021) (Westblade et al. 2020). 
Prevention 
Prevention measures include infection control consisting of widespread vaccination efforts, and non-
therapeutic based approaches such as quarantining, social and physical distancing, and wearing 
Page 7/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
masks. At time of the submission, five vaccines had marketing authorization (MA) in the EU 
(Comirnay, Spikevax, Vaxzevria, Jcovden, Nuvaxovid) being 3 more approved along the procedure 
(Valneva, Vidprevtyn Beta and Bimervax).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit relatively mild symptoms or are 
asymptomatic (Hu, 2020; Oran et al. 2020).  
Approximately 15% of COVID-19 patients develop severe symptoms characterized by the same clinical 
signs of mild to moderate COVID-19 and with one of the following: respiratory rate (≥30 
breaths/minute); severe respiratory distress; or hypoxia requiring hospitalization and oxygen support 
(WHO 2020a) (Cascella et al. 2021). In approximately 5% of infected patients, the severe form of 
interstitial alveolar damage may rapidly progress to critical manifestations of the disease characterized 
by respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that necessitates mechanical 
ventilation and support in an ICU. Complications include sepsis, septic shock and/or multi-organ failure 
including acute kidney and cardiac injury, and even death (WHO 2020a). 
Management 
Initially, treatment of COVID-19 was largely supportive in the outpatient or hospitalized setting and 
included the use of antipyretics, fluids, antibiotics if bacterial secondary or co-infection was suspected, 
and supplemental oxygen. Further treatments have been developed for the treatment of COVID-19 
including both symptomatic and anti-viral therapies and the section below presents a non-exhaustive 
overview of these treatments. 
Remdesivir (Veklury), an antiviral treatment, was granted conditional approval by EMA on 25 June 
2020, for use in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require 
supplemental oxygen. The recommendation was mainly based on data from Study NIAID-ACTT-1, 
sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), that showed that 
treatment with remdesivir resulted in clinically meaningful improvements across multiple outcome 
assessments (including shortening the time to recovery) compared with placebo in hospitalized 
patients with COVID-19 (Beigel et al. 2020). 
On the 11 November 2021, the CHMP issued a positive scientific opinion recommending marketing 
authorization for regdanvimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment for adults with COVID-19 who do not 
require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.  
On the 16 December 2021, the CHMP issued a positive scientific opinion recommending approval of a 
Type II variation extending the use of Kineret (anakinra) to include treatment of COVID-19 in adult 
patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low or high flow oxygen) and who are at risk 
of developing severe respiratory failure, as determined by blood levels of a protein called soluble 
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) of at least 6 ng per ml.  
On the 17 December 2021, the CHMP issued a positive scientific opinion recommending authorization 
for sotrovimab.  
Another monoclonal antibody against COVID-19, Evusheld, reached positive scientific opinion in March 
2022.  
Molnupiravir became available with emergency use authorization (EUA) status in US (molnupiravir, 23 
December 2021) and UK Conditional Approvals (molnupiravir 4 November 2021), for treatment of 
outpatients with COVID-19. This product was also subject to Article 5(3) assessments in the EU in 
November 2022 and it is under review for marketing authorization. 
Another oral treatment, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reached positive opinion in January 2022.  
Page 8/173 
 
  
 
 
 
In the hospitalized setting, the treatment of severe COVID-19 has primarily targeted the management 
of hyper-inflammatory responses. The EMA endorsed use of dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) in 
COVID-19 patients on oxygen or on mechanical ventilation on 18 September 2020 (EMA 2020a). On 6 
December 2021, EMA recommended extending the indication of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor 
antagonist, to include the treatment of adults with COVID-19 who are receiving systemic treatment 
with corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation (EMA 2021b). 
Futhermore, RoActemra ( tocilizumab)  was approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or 
mechanical ventilation. 
Given the continuum of risk of disease with SARS-CoV-2, multiple ongoing global waves of infection 
and the limited treatment options available for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, there remains a 
substantial unmet need for more effective therapies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and: 
●  prevent the progression of disease, or 
● 
● 
reduce the need for more invasive ventilator support therapy, or 
reduce the risk of death related to COVID-19. 
Vaccination is the mainstay of prevention of COVID-19 and although vaccination reduces the relative 
risk of severe COVID-19, the absolute risk remains substantial in high-risk patients who have been 
exposed to the virus (Munro et al. 2021). There are patient populations for whom vaccination could not 
prevent, or is unlikely to be effective in preventing, COVID-19, i.e., those with primary or secondary 
immunodeficiencies (e.g. solid organ transplant recipients, those receiving B-cell depleting therapies 
etc.). As transmission rates increase, those who are fully vaccinated and immunodeficient remain at 
risk and can still develop severe COVID-19 with breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization 
(Munro et al. 2021, Lontok 2021). This is further compounded by the circulation of new variants which 
may not remain susceptible to vaccine immunity. 
Finally, the long-term effectiveness of vaccines is currently under investigation and remains uncertain. 
Recently, booster strategies have been required to continue to protect individuals from COVID-19 and 
it is likely that subgroups of the population may continue to require booster doses to remain protected. 
It is highly likely that SARS-CoV- 2 will continue to evolve and transmit given the mechanism of action 
of all available vaccines which provide neutralizing but not sterilizing immunity. This remains a major 
concern for the fight against SARS-CoV-2. A long-term vaccination strategy will most likely be 
required, should SARS-CoV-2 continue to evolve and cause high levels of morbidity and mortality 
2.1.2.  
About the product 
Casirivimab and imdevimab (also referred to as Ronapreve, REGEN-COV, REGN-COV, REGN-COV2 and 
REGN-COV-2) are 2 human, high affinity, IgG1 mAbs that bind non-overlapping epitopes on the 
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and block interaction with ACE2 and 
consequently blocking viral entry into host cells. These mAbs are non-competing with one another, 
exhibit potent neutralization and can bind simultaneously to the S protein RBD. 
When co-administered as combination therapy, casirivimab+imdevimab treatment neutralizes SARS-
CoV-2 in cell culture, minimizes the likelihood of viral escape due to genetic mutations and prevents 
and treats infection in animal models (MAA, Module 2.4). 
2.1.3.  
guidance/scientific advice 
The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab broadly across the SARSCoV- 2 infection 
and COVID-19 spectrum, the clinical development program for casirivimab+imdevimab employed 
multiple trials comprised consisting of different participant populations, including adolescents and 
adults with or without risk factors for severe COVID-19, in the outpatient and hospitalized settings.

Study COV-2066 
The clinical pharmacology program for this submission is supported by data from COV-2066 only and 
by population PK (pop-PK) analyses from data pooled from several studies included in the Marketing 
Authorization Application. No PK data was collected from RECOVERY. 
Summary of studies contributing to PK, IG and PD evaluation: 
Study COV-2066 was an adaptive, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study 
in hospitalized adult patients with four cohorts in the study according to disease severity.  
Enrolment in Cohort 2 and 3 was placed on hold during Phase 2 recruitment. Patients were randomized 
in each cohort and each phase to receive a single IV dose of 2400 mg, 8000 mg or placebo in a 1:1:1 
ratio (see table below). Immunogenicity, as measured by ADAs and Nabs, was accessible (all phases 
combined + placebo) in 1504 patients. PK samples were collected: Phase1 - at pre-dose and post-dose 
(within 60 minutes after the end of infusion) on study Day 1, at discharge before Day 29, on Days 3, 
5, 7, 15, 29, 57, and 113 over the hospitalization/post-discharge period, and at End of Study on Day 
29; Phase 2 and 3: at pre-dose and post-dose (within 60 minutes after the end of infusion) on Day 1, 
at discharge before Day 29, and on Days 15 and 29 over the hospitalization/post-discharge period. 
Page 12/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 1 
Casirivimab and imdevimab concentration-time profiles in serum following 1.2 g and 4.0 g single IV 
doses of each antibody (2.4 g and 8.0 g combined doses, respectively) in Phase 1 showed a profile 
consistent with linear pharmacokinetics, defined by an initial distribution phase followed by a terminal 
mono-exponential elimination phase (see figure below). Peak serum concentrations for each antibody 
were generally achieved at around EOI. Due to small patient numbers and variability of concentrations 
Page 13/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the terminal phase, mono-exponential decline is not clearly discernible in the mean concentration-
time profiles.  
Phase 2 and 3 
Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in serum following 1.2 g and 4.0 g single doses of each 
antibody were similar to each other at the EOI as well as on Day 28 in Phase 2 and in Phase 3 for each 
cohort of patients (see tables and figures below).  
Page 14/173

Additionally, casirivimab and imdevimab Ceoi and C28 in serum for Phase 3 Cohort 1 patients were 
comparable to Cohort 1 patients from Phase 1 and Phase 2.   
The median observed concentrations for hospitalized patients in Study COV-2066 are lower than the 
median observed concentrations for outpatients with COVID-19 in Studies COV-2067 and COV-20145, 
suggesting that the CL of casirivimab and imdevimab in hospitalized patients is faster than in the 
outpatient setting.

NCA 
Non-compartmental analysis to estimate PK parameters such area under the concentration-time curve 
from time 0 to 28 days post dose (AUC0-28), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), and serum 
Page 20/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration at 28 days post dose (C28) was performed only for data collected in the Phase 1 portion 
of this study, where dense sampling over the first 28 days was available.  
Due to the limited PK sample collection in subsequent phases of the study, only concentrations of 
casirivimab and imdevimab in serum are summarized descriptively at the EOI and at Day 28 by 
treatment group, phase and/or cohort for Phase 2 and Phase 3. 
Population PK 
Previous pop-PK modelling was updated with data from hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 
(COV-2066) to characterize the PK and identify and quantify source of variability on the PK of both 
antibodies. The model was developed based on data from uninfected and infected individuals with 
SARS-CoV-2 and household contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.   
The primary objectives of the analysis were to: 
- Characterize the concentration-time profiles of casirivimab and imdevimab in uninfected subjects, 
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and household contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, 
and hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
- Evaluate candidate covariate effects on PK parameters, such as hospitalization status, disease 
severity, and inflammatory biomarkers. 
Page 21/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Estimate individual PK parameters and individual metrics of drug exposure. 
The final updated model included data from four clinical studies: one Phase 1/2/3 study in outpatients 
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COV-2067), one Phase 3 study in household contacts of patients infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 (COV-2069), one Phase 2 study in outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COV-
20145), and data from the Phase 1/2/3 study in hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COV-
2066), with a total of approximately 5000 individuals including approximately 1300 hospitalized 
patients. Casirivimab+imdevimab was administered IV (300 mg [150 mg per mAb] to 8000 mg [4000 
mg per mAb], single dose) or subcutaneously (600 mg [300 mg per mAb] to 1200 mg [600 mg per 
mAb], single dose).  
The popPK modelling updates for casirivimab and imdevimab were performed using pooled data 
totalling 4981 unique subjects/patients with 10552 quantifiable casirivimab concentrations and 5009 
unique subjects/patients with 11019 quantifiable imdevimab concentrations in serum.

Individual PK Parameters 
Predicted exposure metrics for a 2400 mg and 8000 mg IV casirivimab+imdevimab single dose are 
presented in the tables below for patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection from Study 2066. 
Patients on high-intensity oxygen or mechanical ventilation had a more severe infection compared to 
patients requiring only low-flow oxygen; therefore, predicted metrics from the 8000 mg IV dose of 
casirivimab+imdevimab were calculated for these more severe patients. 
Page 24/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Model development 
Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were observed to have faster clearances of casirivimab+imdevimab 
compared to the clearances from the previous population of non-hospitalized patients. Therefore, the 
impact of hospitalization status and disease severity was evaluated in the model via post-hoc covariate 
analyses using the previously developed PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab as the reference 
models. Disease severity was defined by the level of baseline oxygen supplementation therapy 
required, where patients were defined as requiring no oxygen therapy, receiving low-flow oxygen via 
nasal cannula or other similar devices (low flow oxygen), or requiring high-intensity oxygen therapy or 
Page 25/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
mechanical ventilation (high flow oxygen). Furthermore, time-varying albumin was also evaluated to 
assess whether there was any additional improvement to the model fit over baseline albumin levels. 
Each covariate-parameter combination was evaluated one at a time using a forward selection process, 
where the covariate-parameter relationship leading to the greatest reduction in objective function 
value (OFV) relative to the reference model was retained. This process was repeated until no additional 
covariates met the selection criteria (ie, ΔOFV >10.8 [p<0.001] for df =1 [hospitalization status]; 
ΔOFV >13.8 for df=2 [baseline level of oxygen therapy]). As a final step in the process, baseline 
albumin was replaced with time-varying albumin to evaluate whether the replacement of the baseline 
value with time-varying values would improve model fit as evaluated by ΔOFV >10.8 (p<0.001). 
Patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infections were anticipated to have a higher inflammatory 
response compared to individuals in the outpatient setting based on observations from a study with 
sarilumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a full model was developed to explore the 
impact of inflammatory biomarkers which were not considered in the previous analysis. 
A stepwise backward elimination procedure using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to identify 
parsimonious PopPK models once the full models for casirivimab and imdevimab were built. Statistical 
tests of covariate parameter relationships were assessed with the LRT, based on the property that the 
difference of the NONMEM® objective function values (dOFV or ΔOFV) of two hierarchical models (-2 
log-likelihood) is asymptotically χ2-distributed. The full model was subjected to a backward elimination 
procedure associated with p<0.001 (ΔOFV>10.8) when one covariate parameter was excluded. The 
covariate-parameter relationship which had the lowest change in OFV and did not meet the inclusion 
criteria (ie, ΔOFV <10.8 [p>0.001]) was eliminated and the stepwise backward elimination procedure 
was repeated until all covariate parameters met the inclusion criteria.  
In this current analysis, the following covariates were evaluated: 
• Hospitalization status – a categorical variable indicating whether patients were hospitalized for SARS-
CoV-2 infection or were in the outpatient setting (ie, Study 2066 vs. Other [Studies 2067, 2069, and 
20145]) 
• Disease severity – a categorical variable describing degree of SARS-CoV-2 disease severity based on 
baseline levels of oxygen supplementation required, defined as follows: 
− No supplemental oxygen required 
− Low Flow Oxygen – Patients receiving low-flow oxygen therapy 
− High Flow Oxygen – Patients receiving high-intensity oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation 
• Inflammatory biomarkers – continuous variables quantifying biomarker levels present for each 
subject 
− Availability of biomarkers per study is provided in the table below. 
The correlation plot provided in the figure below demonstrate that INT-1β and INT-8 are highly 
correlated (ρ > 0.8); therefore, INT-1β was removed from consideration from the full model.

Casirivimab – full model 
The covariate-parameter relationships which showed trends based on the screening procedure above 
and are included in the full model for casirivimab were C-reactive protein (CRP) on CL, ferritin on CL, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on CL, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on CL, IL-8 on CL, TNF on CL, 
MIP-1β on CL, IL-6 on CL, IL-10 on CL, IFN-g on Vc, IL-6 on Vc, IL-8 on Vc, and TNF on Vc. After 
backward elimination (ΔOFV > 10.8 [p<0.001]), the covariate-parameter relationships included in the 
final model (Run 7000) for casirivimab were CRP on CL and IL-8 on CL. 
Imdevimab – full model 
The covariate-parameter relationships which showed trends based on the screening procedure above 
and are included in the full model for imdevimab were C-reactive protein (CRP) on CL, ferritin on CL, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on CL, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on CL, IL-8 on CL, TNF on CL, 
MIP-1β on CL, IL-6 on CL, IL-10 on CL, IL-6 on Vc, IL-8 on Vc, and TNF on Vc. After backward 
elimination (ΔOFV > 10.8 [p<0.001]), the covariate-parameter relationships included in the final 
model (Run 7000) for imdevimab were CRP on CL and NLR on CL. 
Model evaluation and validation 
Diagnostic plots were generated including concordance (eg, PRED vs DV and IPRED vs DV), residual 
(eg, CWRES vs PRED, CWRES vs time, IWRES vs IPRED, and IWRES vs time), and overlay plots (eg, 
DV, PRED, and IPRED vs time). Plots of the individual random effect values versus covariate values 
were generated in order to identify trends indicating possible covariate effects to be accounted for in 
the full covariate model. In addition, boxplots of the η values versus dose and study were generated to 
evaluate dose invariance and adequacy of pooling studies for this analysis, respectively. Furthermore, 
a comparison of the OFV and parameter estimates for the starting models, the updated full models, 
and resulting final models was used to assess the degree of parsimony of the final models. 
Page 27/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Bootstrapping, which mitigates concerns about a potential asymmetrical distribution of parameters or 
non-asymptotic assumptions, was performed on the respective final models for casirivimab and 
imdevimab. 
An internal visual predictive check (VPC) was performed on the respective final models for casirivimab 
and imdevimab. The parameter estimates were fixed to the values estimated in the final model runs 
and used to generate 500 datasets which replicated the design, subject population, dose regimens, 
sample sizes, and covariate distributions from the pooled observed dataset. 
The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the simulated median, 2.5th , and 97.5th percentiles of the 
simulated casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations were calculated and plotted as a function of time 
overlaid on the observed casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations to provide a visual assessment of 
the predictive performance of the PK model.  
Diagnostic plots of concordance provided in the figure below suggest good agreement between the 
observed data and the model predictions, and casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in Study 
2066 highlighted in the plots span the range of observed concentrations from Studies 2067, 2069, and 
20145:

Absorption 
For the treatment of hospitalized patients, the IV route of administration results in 100% bioavailability 
of casirivimab+imdevimab.  Following IV administration of casirivimab and imdevimab, peak serum 
concentrations for each antibody is generally achieved at end of infusion. 
Page 35/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Based on population PK analysis, the total volume of distribution in hospitalized patients is estimated 
to be 7.072 L and 7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively, consistent with previously 
reported values estimated from a dataset of non-hospitalized patients. 
Elimination 
As monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to be eliminated by the kidney 
due to their large molecular weight, or metabolized in the liver, but are catabolised to small peptides 
and individual amino acids. Casirivimab and imdevimab showed comparable clearance and elimination 
half-life values in hospitalized patients (see table below). Results from pop-PK analysis suggests an 
increase in casirivimab and imdevimab clearance in hospitalized patients as compared with non-
hospitalized patients with increased degree of disease severity. The estimated mean CL for casirivimab 
and imdevimab in hospitalized participants requiring high flow oxygen (0.563 L/day and 0.668 L/day, 
respectively) was higher compared to hospitalized participants not requiring oxygen supplementation 
or on low flow oxygen (0.358 L/day and 0.417 L/day, respectively). The terminal half-life also 
decreased as the degree of disease severity increased. Besides, weight – as expected from previous PK 
analyses – was indicated to be one of the most influential covariates on clearance. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Casirivimab and imdevimab showed similar, linear, and dose-proportional PK following single IV doses 
of 2400 mg and 8000 mg casirivimab+imdevimab. Concentration of casirivimab and imdevimab in 
serum on Day 28 (C28) decreased with increasing COVID-19 disease severity (as approximated by 
study Cohort 3) while concentrations at the end of infusion (EOI) or dose normalized concentration at 
EOI remained similar between cohorts, indicating that casirivimab and imdevimab clearance increases 
as disease severity increases.  
Page 36/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Only single dose PK data was collected, thus no information on multiple dosing and steady state 
reached is assessable. Following a single IV dose administration of casirivimab and imdevimab, the 
increase in concentration at the end of infusion between the 1200 mg and 4000 mg doses of each 
antibody appeared to be proportional to the increase in dose in hospitalized patients. 
A summary of PK parameters after a single IV dose, calculated using a pop-PK model for each antibody 
is provided in the table below. 
Phase 1:  The increase in serum concentration of each antibody was proportional to the increase in 
dose from 2.4 g to 8.0 g. Casirivimab and imdevimab exposures in serum increased proportionally with 
increases in dose from 2.4 g to 8.0 g as evidenced by similar dose-normalized Cmax and AUC0-28. At 
each dose level, mean concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab were similar over the month 
following dosing. However, imdevimab concentrations in serum were lower than casirivimab at later 
time points, suggesting concentrations of imdevimab decline more rapidly than casirivimab. 
Phase 2: The 8.0 g combined dose resulted in greater casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations as 
compared to the 2.4 g combined dose in all cohorts, with the increase in concentrations appearing 
dose proportional (see figure below).

Special populations 
The pop-PK models for casirivimab and imdevimab were updated to include data from hospitalized 
patients enrolled in COV-2066. Additional covariates in this updated model were disease severity, c-
reactive protein (CRP), and IL-8 on CL, and hospitalization status on clearance (CL) and Vc for 
Page 38/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
casirivimab; and hospitalization status, disease severity, CRP, and neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio on CL 
for imdevimab. 
Forest plots demonstrating covariates effects on casirivimab or imdevimab concentration on Day 28 
(Cday28) after administration of a single 8000 mg IV casirivimab+imdevimab dose (4000 mg per 
mAb) are presented in the figures below for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. Analogous plots 
for a single 2400 mg IV dose (1200 mg per mAb) are presented, respectively, that appear comparable.  
For casirivimab, the reference subject is defined with the following characteristics: Non-Black, male, 
hepatic function other than mild hepatic impairment, not hospitalized, not receiving oxygen therapy, 
weight of 82.2 kg, albumin level of 42 g/L, viral load of 6.29 log10 copies/mL, CRP level of 4.29 mg/L, 
and IL-8 levels of 28.1 pg/mL. Mild hepatic impairment, Black race, and viral load provided casirivimab 
exposure ratios of ~1 compared to the reference. Females had approximately 10-13% higher 
casirivimab exposures compared to males. Both CRP and IL-8 were predicted to have about 3-10% 
impact on exposures at the 5th and 95th percentiles of CRP and IL-8 in the study population compared 
to the approximate median value. 
The primary covariates impacting casirivimab PK (> 16% impact on exposures) were disease severity, 
hospitalization status, albumin, and body weight. Cday28 was predicted to be 23% lower in patients 
requiring high-intensity oxygen flow or mechanical ventilation compared to reference, 16% lower in 
hospitalized patients compared to outpatients, 22% lower in patients with lower albumin levels (5th 
percentile: 30 g/L) compared to the reference level of 42 g/L, and 26% lower in patients with higher 
body weight (95th percentile: 127 kg) compared to the reference weight of 82.2 kg.

For imdevimab, the reference subject is defined with the following characteristics: Non-Black, male, 
hepatic function other than mild hepatic impairment, not hospitalized, not receiving oxygen therapy, 
weight of 82.2 kg, albumin level of 42 g/L, viral load of 6.29 log10 copies/mL, CRP level of 4.29 mg/L, 
and NLR of 2.07. Mild hepatic impairment, Black race, viral load, and NLR provided imdevimab 
exposure ratios of ~1 compared to the reference. Females had approximately 10-14% higher 
imdevimab exposures compared to males. CRP was predicted to have about 4-11% impact on 
exposures at the 5th and 95th percentiles of CRP in the study population compared to the approximate 
median value. 
The primary covariates impacting imdevimab PK (> 23% impact on exposures) were disease severity, 
albumin, and body weight. Cday28 was predicted to be 28% lower in patients requiring high-intensity 
oxygen flow or mechanical ventilation compared to reference, 23% lower in patients with lower 
albumin levels (5th percentile: 30 g/L) compared to the reference level of 42 g/L, and 26% lower in 
patients with higher body weight (95th percentile: 127 kg) compared to the reference weight of 82.2 
kg.

Disease severity 
Phase 2: Casirivimab and imdevimab C28 in serum decreased with increasing COVID-19 disease 
severity, as assessed by Cohort in Phase 2, while Ceoi or dose normalized Ceoi remained similar 
between Cohorts, indicating that casirivimab and imdevimab clearance increases as disease severity 
increases (Figure 2 and Figure 3, Table 6). The increased clearance of casirivimab and imdevimab, 
particularly in patients requiring high intensity oxygen or ventilatory support, may be related to 
physiological changes secondary to an increased inflammatory state in these patients.  
The relationship between casirivimab and imdevimab C28 and serum albumin concentration (baseline 
and Day 28), as well as the relationship between casirivimab and imdevimab C28 and serum CRP 
concentration (baseline and Day 28) were evaluated. Weak positive associations between casirivimab 
and imdevimab C28 and Day 28 concentration of serum albumin, and weak inverse associations 
between casirivimab and imdevimab C28 and Day 28 concentration of CRP were observed for both the 
2400 mg and 8000 mg doses (see figures below).  
Page 43/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weak positive associations between casirivimab and imdevimab C28 and baseline concentration of 
albumin in serum, and week inverse associations between casirivimab and imdevimab C28 and 
baseline concentration of CRP in serum were also observed at baseline (see the 2 figures below)

Stochastic simulations to predict exposure metrics for patients receiving a single dose of 2400 mg IV 
casirivimab+imdevimab (1200 mg per mAb for hospitalized patients receiving low-flow oxygen 
therapy) or 8000 mg IV of casirivimab+imdevimab (4000 mg per mAb for hospitalized patients 
receiving high-flow oxygen therapy) are presented below.

Two additional simulations were performed where patients in Study 2066 received 
casirivimab+imdevimab as a single dose of 2400 mg IV (1200 mg per mAb) and 8000 mg IV (4000 mg 
per mAb) to examine Cday28 values across cohorts:  
Exposure metrics for casirivimab and imdevimab were calculated using the individual full 
concentration-time profiles predicted following either a single dose of 2400 mg IV or 8000 mg IV of 
casirivimab+imdevimab and are provided in the tables below, respectively.

Serostatus 
Concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum were not affected by baseline serostatus 
(positive or negative) or by baseline viral load (Phase 2:  two first figures below; Phase 3: 3rd and 4th 
figures below), indicating that baseline viral load and serostatus did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
either casirivimab or imdevimab.

Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Casirivimab and imdevimab are potent neutralizing antibodies that block the interaction between the 
transmembrane S protein (spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus) and its canonical host receptor 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The combination of casirivimab+imdevimab retained 
neutralization potency against the full sequences or key residues of the spike protein of the B.1.1.7 
(Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.6172 (Delta), AY.1/2 (commonly referred to as Delta+), 
Page 53/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
B.1.617.1 (Kappa), C.37 (Lambda), and B.1.619 (Mu) variants. Likewise, casirivimab+imdevimab 
neutralized the L452R and E484K mutations, which have been flagged by the CDC as substitutions of 
therapeutic concern. Compared with reference virus, the B.1.1.529/BA.1 (Omicron) variant is 
approximately a thousand-fold less susceptible to casirivimab+imdevimab. Therefore, 
casirivimab+imdevimab is expected to retain activity against all currently known SARS-CoV-2 VUS 
except for Omicron. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
This is the first time that clinical pharmacology results including NAb analyses are submitted in this 
product registration. There was no impact of immunogenicity on concentrations of casirivimab or 
imdevimab in serum, as indicated below. 
The incidence of ADA and neutralizing antibodies in hospitalized patients receiving casirivimab and 
imdevimab as a single IV dose was low and similar for all treatment groups, i.e. 2400 mg, 8000 mg 
and placebo: The majority of hospitalized patients were negative for ADA at all times (96.0% for 
casirivimab; 91.4% for imdevimab), indicating minimal immunogenicity following administration of 
single IV doses of 2400 mg or 8000 mg of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent immunogenicity for patients who received active treatment 
(2400 mg and 8000 mg combined) was 2.1% (21/1001) and 4.4% (44/1001) for casirivimab and 
imdevimab, respectively. Patients who received placebo had an immunogenicity rate of 1.4% (7/503) 
and 3.0% (15/503) for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. In the combined treatment-emergent 
and treatment-boosted group from patients who received active treatment, most (greater than 95%) 
of the few ADA responses detected were low, with no high titer response observed.  
Page 54/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA, casirivimab and imdevimab C28 in 
serum appeared similar for patients with low and moderate maximum titer, although too few patients 
had moderate titer to draw definitive conclusions (see figure below). 
Page 55/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
For patients who had pre-existing, treatment-emergent, or treatment-boosted ADA with or without 
NAb, casirivimab and imdevimab C28 in serum were similar and within the range of values in patients 
who were ADA negative (see figure below). 
Page 56/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
PD Biomarker 
The PD effect of casirivimab+imdevimab was assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction, 
which is considered a direct effect driven by the mechanism of action of casirivimab+imdevimab in 
blocking the interaction of the S protein of the virus with human ACE2 receptor. As blocking viral entry 
would result in decreased infection of host cells and corresponding reduction in viral shedding in 
affected tissues, virologic efficacy was assessed by collecting NP swab samples from participants to 
determine the relative quantification of viral load. The SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (log10 copies/mL) in NP 
swabs were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
assay with an LLOQ of 714 copies/mL (2.85 log10 copies/mL). 
SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Reduction in Clinical Studies 
Nasopharyngeal viral load 
The concentration-response relationship between viral load reduction and casirivimab+imdevimab 
combined concentration in serum was assessed in the concentration-response-seronegative 
participants across Phases 1, 2, and 3 of COV-2066. As a PD marker, nasopharyngeal viral load (NP 
VL) data were collected at predose and postdose (within 60 minutes after the end of infusion) on study 
Day 1, at discharge before Day 29, on Days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 22, 29 (Phase 1, 2 and 3). 
Page 57/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Primary Virologic Efficacy Endpoint:  
Time-Weighted Average (TWA) Daily Change from Baseline in Viral Load from Day 1 to Day 7. 
The TWA daily change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in NP as assessed from Days 1 to 7 was 
a primary virologic efficacy variable. The analysis was performed in those who were seronegative at 
baseline (seronegative mFAS) to minimize any confounding effects that the endogenous immune 
response would have on measuring the magnitude of anti-viral effect with casirivimab+imdevimab 
treatment. In seronegative patients, casirivimab+imdevimab treatment (combined doses) reduced the 
TWA daily viral load through Day 7, compared to placebo, by -0.28 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, -
0.05], p=0.0172). This met the first primary efficacy endpoint pre-specified in the statistical hierarchy. 
Benefit was also observed in the overall mFAS (difference vs. placebo of -0.26 log10 [95 % CI -0.41, -
0.02 copies/mL]), but antiviral activity was most striking in seronegative participants who had not yet 
mounted their own endogenous immune response at baseline as opposed to seropositive patients.  
Additionally, a greater treatment effect was observed in participants with high baseline viral load >106 
copies/mL (difference vs. placebo of -0.32 log10 copies/mL, [95% CI -0.51, -0.13 copies/mL]) 
compared to those with a baseline viral load ≤106 copies/mL (difference vs placebo of -0.17 log10 
copies/mL [95% CI -0.39, 0.05 copies/mL]); 
Page 58/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent results were observed for both individual doses (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) compared to 
placebo in seronegative participants, indicating the absence of a dose response effect (2400 mg: least 
squares [LS] mean -0.25 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, 0.02]; 8000 mg: LS mean -0.31 log10 
copies/mL [95% CI -0.57, -0.05]) (Figure 4). 
The time-weighted average (TWA) daily change from baseline in viral load from day 1 to day 7 is 
presented in the table below. 
Secondary Virologic Efficacy Endpoint: Time-Weighted Average (TWA) Change from Baseline Viral 
Load in NP Samples from Day 1 to Day 11. 
The TWA daily change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in NP as assessed from Day 1 to Day 11 
was assessed as a secondary virological efficacy variable. Casirivimab+imdevimab treatment 
(combined and individual doses) reduced the TWA daily viral load through Day 11, compared to 
placebo in the Seronegative mFAS (p<0.0001), the High Viral Load (nominal p=0.0010), and the 
Overall mFAS (p<0.0001) 
Page 59/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
TWA daily change from baseline also remained nominally significant through Day 29 in these 
populations. 
The TWA change from baseline in viral load (as assessed from Days 1 to 7, 1 to 11, and 1 to 28) 
exhibited no concentration-related differences over the exposure range investigated, indicating that 
concentrations in serum for both the 2400 mg and 8000 mg IV doses were sufficient to achieve 
maximum effect on viral load for hospitalized participants.  
This finding was observed despite the increased CL in hospitalized participants compared to non-
hospitalized participants, as well as the increased CL of casirivimab and imdevimab particularly in 
patients requiring high flow oxygen or respiratory support.  
Notably, the number of participants on high flow oxygen (Cohort 2) or requiring mechanical ventilation 
(Cohort 3) included in this analysis were very small. Therefore, the results from these analyses are 
mainly driven by participants not requiring oxygen or on low flow oxygen, which supports the use of 
2400 mg IV for these patients.

PK/PD modelling 
Concentration-Response Analysis of Viral Load (compare 5.3.3) 
The concentration-response relationship between viral load reduction and C28 of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum was assessed in the concentration-response-seronegative 
participants across Phases 1, 2, and 3 of COV-2066 (CR-seronegative mFAS). Because casirivimab and 
imdevimab both compete with the host immune response, the CR relationship was conducted in 
individuals that had not yet mounted an immune response and were seronegative at baseline. 
The TWA change from baseline in viral load (as assessed from Days 1 to 7, 1 to 11, and 1 to 28) 
exhibited no concentration-related differences over the exposure range investigated, indicating that 
concentrations in serum for both the 2400 mg and 8000 mg IV doses were sufficient to achieve 
maximum effect on viral load for hospitalized participants. Scatter plots of TWA change from baseline 
in viral load versus log-scaled C28 of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum by baseline viral load 
category are presented in Figure 6 (from Day 1 through Day 7) and Figure 52 (from Day 1 through 
Day 11) Figure 53 (from Day 1 through Day 28).

Whereas Ronapreve 1200 mg intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) was approved for treatment of 
COVID-19 in out-patients, higher doses, 2400 mg and 8000 mg IV, are proposed for the treatment of 
more severe COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients, recommend depending on disease severity. 
Concentrations of Casirivimab and Imdevimab in serum required to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 
Reference Viruses and VOI/VOC 
Serum concentrations of casirivimab + imdevimab combined, casirivimab and imdevimab required to 
achieve 90% neutralization concentrations (IC90) in respiratory tract fluids (Cs,target) on Day 28 were 
estimated for hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 for the proposed doses. The results are shown for 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined in table below. Notably, due to poor or lack of neutralization, IC50 
and IC90 values were not calculated for the Omicron variant. Therefore, the following assumptions 
were derived for all currently circulating SARSCoV-2 variants with the exception of the Omicron 
variant. 
For hospitalized patients the serum concentrations of casivirimab+imdevimab combined on Day 28 
(C28) were in excess of serum concentrations required to achieve Cs,target for SARS-CoV-2 variants 
for both dose groups and all cohorts (table below). For the 2400 mg IV dose group, the median C28 of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined from hospitalized patients not on oxygen or on low flow oxygen 
were at least 9-fold above Cs,target for all known circulating SARS-CoV-2 VUS prior to Omicron, 
further reaffirming that the 2400 mg IV dose in these patients should provide maximal antiviral effect 
against all known circulating SARS-CoV-2 VUS (with the exception of Omicron) over a 28-day period.  
For patients on high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation who received 2400 mg IV, the C28 of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined was only 4.9-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively, above Cs,target for 
E484K variant, suggesting that 2400 mg might be a subtherapeutic dose for those patients. While the 
8000 mg IV dose, provided a C28 of casirivimab+imdevimab combined that were at least 12.6-fold 
above Cs,target for all known circulating SARS-CoV- 2 VUS prior to Omicron. This suggested that 8000 
mg IV will maintain maximal antiviral effect over this 28-day period in hospitalized patients on high 
flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation (table below).

2.3.5.  
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the context of this variation procedure, the following to-be-marketed dosage in adult and adolescent 
patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen is 
foreseen: 
- 4000 mg of casirivimab and 4000 mg of imdevimab administered together as a single IV infusion for 
patients who are on low-flow and high-flow oxygen devices, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 
The clinical pharmacology program for this submission is supported by PK and PD data (viral load) 
from COV-2066 only and by population PK (pop-PK) analyses from data pooled from several studies 
included in the Marketing Authorization Application. No PK data was collected from RECOVERY. 
Study COV-2066 was an adaptive, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study 
in hospitalized adult patients with four cohorts in the study according to disease severity. Of note, 
sample size decreased with disease severity, and was limited in cohorts 2 (N=53) and 3 (N=11). 
Overall, the updated PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab with inclusion of data from 
hospitalized patients retained the same structure as the previously developed PopPK model with some 
additional statistically significant covariate effects reflecting the disease state and severity.  
The popPK modelling updates for casirivimab and imdevimab were performed based on comprehensive 
pooled data of in total 4981 unique subjects/patients with 10552 quantifiable casirivimab 
concentrations and 5009 unique subjects/patients with 11019 quantifiable imdevimab concentrations 
in serum following a dose range from 150 mg to 4000 mg per mab. 
For casirivimab PK, the strongest covariates impacting PK were disease severity, hospitalization status, 
albumin, and body weight, with an impact of > 16% on exposures, in particular for Cday28. For 
imdevimab PK, the primary covariates influencing PK were disease severity, albumin, and body weight, 
with an impact of > 22% compared to reference. Hospitalization status was predicted to impact 
imdevimab exposure of 13% on Cday28 compared to reference. 
Baseline viral load, ADA and serostatus did not alter the pharmacokinetics of either casirivimab or 
imdevimab to a clinically relevant level. 
Visual predictive check (VPC) results demonstrated that the final models for both monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) provide overall a reliable description of PK data collected from COV-2066 for at least 
50 days post dose. A certain degree of shrinkage is indicated. 
Based on population PK analysis, the total volume of distribution in hospitalized patients is estimated 
to be 7.072 L and 7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively, consistent with previously 
reported values estimated from a dataset of non-hospitalized patients. Bioavailability is 100% following 
a single dose IV. 
Page 64/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The estimated elimination half-life for casirivimab and imdevimab in hospitalized patients was 
approximately 18 and 16 days compared to approximately 30 and 25 days for non-hospitalized 
patients, respectively, as an indication of increased clearance that may be attributed to an increased 
protein catabolism. The estimated mean CL for casirivimab and imdevimab in hospitalized participants 
requiring high flow oxygen (0.563 L/day and 0.668 L/day, respectively) was higher compared to 
hospitalized participants not requiring oxygen supplementation or on low flow oxygen (0.358 L/day 
and 0.417 L/day, respectively). 
Casirivimab and imdevimab showed similar, linear, and dose-proportional PK following single IV doses 
of 2400 mg and 8000 mg casirivimab+imdevimab, with decreasing concentrations of casirivimab and 
imdevimab in serum on Day 28 (C28) with increasing COVID-19 disease severity (as approximated by 
study Cohort 3). Concentrations at the end of infusion (EOI) or dose normalized concentration at EOI 
remained similar between cohorts, indicating that casirivimab and imdevimab clearance increases as 
disease severity increases.  
Only single dose PK data was collected, thus no information on multiple dosing and steady state 
reached is assessable. Following a single IV dose administration of casirivimab and imdevimab, the 
increase in concentration at the end of infusion between the 1200 mg and 4000 mg doses of each 
antibody appeared to be proportional to the increase in dose in hospitalized patients. 
PK data was only collected from adult subjects in COV-2066, while doses proposed are also 
recommended for adolescents aged at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg. Weight 
ranged from 38.5 kg to 218 kg in COV-2066 and resulted in an increase in C28 of 27% and 21% for 
patients at 56.2 kg (5th percentile) compared to the reference patient (82.2 kg) for both antibodies. As 
weight was indicated as one of the most predictive covariates in addition to disease severity, dose 
recommendation should be subjected to scrutiny with regard to weight.  
The PD effect of casirivimab+imdevimab was assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction. 
Virologic efficacy was assessed by collecting NP swab samples from participants to determine the 
relative quantification of viral load. The SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (log10 copies/mL) in nasopharyngeal 
swabs were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
assay with an LLOQ of 714 copies/mL (2.85 log10 copies/mL). 
The primary virologic efficacy endpoint was defined as time-weighted average (TWA) daily change 
from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load from Day1 to Day7 and was met in seronegative patients at 
baseline. In seronegative patients, casirivimab+imdevimab treatment reduced the TWA daily viral load 
through Day 7, compared to placebo, by -0.28 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, -0.05], p=0.0172). 
Consistent results were observed for both tested doses (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) compared to 
placebo in seronegative participants, indicating the absence of a dose response effect (2400 mg: least 
squares [LS] mean -0.25 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, 0.02]; 8000 mg: LS mean -0.31 log10 
copies/mL [95% CI -0.57, -0.05]). Similar results have been observed considering the secondary 
virologic efficacy endpoint – TWA change from baseline viral load in NP samples from Day1 to Day11. 
Casirivimab+imdevimab treatment reduced the TWA daily viral load through Day 11, compared to 
placebo in the Seronegative mFAS (p<0.0001), the High Viral Load (nominal p=0.0010), and the 
Overall mFAS (p<0.0001) population. 
Overall, as indicated in all clinical studies providing clinical pharmacology data throughout the clinical 
development, no dose-dependent and no exposure-dependent differences – as between time-weighted 
average (TWA) change from baseline in viral load (as assessed from Days 1 to 7, 1 to 11, and 1 to 28) 
and C28 of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum - were observed for the exposure range 
investigated in the seronegative modified full analysis set (mFAS) population across all phases of the 
study. These results indicate that concentrations following 2400 mg and 8000 mg IV are expected to 
provide maximum effect on viral load. Of note, PD biomarker viral load is not deemed predictive in 
terms of clinical efficacy and for definite dose selection. Viral load is expected to be highest with start 
of symptoms and is expected to decline within about one week. Thus, a more than three times higher 
dose in case of hospitalization and severe disease is not fully plausible from the PD point of view. 
Page 65/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Further, such a high dose might in particular not be fully justified especially for adolescent patients at 
low weight and given the clinical outcome (see section clinical efficacy). 
As sample size of patients on high flow oxygen (Cohort 2) or respiratory support (Cohort 3) included in 
this analysis were very small, the results from these analyses are mainly driven by patients not on 
oxygen or on low flow oxygen. 
With regard to dose justification, fold changes in C28 to Cs target have been proposed for patients on 
high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation who received 2400 mg IV or 8000 mg IV. The expected 
C28 of casirivimab+imdevimab combined following 2400 mg IV was only 4.9-fold and 3.8-fold, 
respectively, above Cs, target for E484K variant. The MAH suggested that 2400 mg might be a 
subtherapeutic dose for those patients while the 8000 mg IV dose would provided a C28 of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined that is at least 12.6-fold above Cs,target for all known circulating 
SARS-CoV- 2 VUS prior to Omicron. Weight has not been considered in any dosing considerations by 
the MAH. The assumption of serum-to NF and serum-to lung ELF partition coefficient of 0.01 is agreed 
as reflecting a conservative estimate.  
Given that C28 might not be the optimal PK metrics for comparison in a treatment setting, and viral 
load as a PD is not predictive with respect to dose-response and the clinical outcome, the MAH was 
asked to further justify the 8000 mg IV dose, especially for adult and adolescent patients at low 
weight. The MAH was also asked to calculate the expected exposure following 8000 mg IV and 2400 
mg IV assuming hospitalization (and different degrees of severity cohorts) for 10-kilogram body weight 
bins (40-50kg, 50-60 kg, 60-70kg,…, 150-160 kg), respectively. Ratios of C28/Cs,target of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined and C14/Cs,target should be calculated for each bin, assuming an in 
vitro inhibition of 90% (IC90) for all strains prior to Omicron. In response to this point, an evaluation 
of the concentrations of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum required to achieve in vitro 
neutralization potency IC90 in lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) at Days 14 and 28 following 8000 mg 
IV, 2400 mg IV and 1200 mg IV doses for patients on no supplemental oxygen, low-flow oxygen, and 
high-flow oxygen was provided by 10 kg body weight bins (range 40-160 kg) as requested. The target 
adjusted-IC90 values (ta-IC90) for pre-Omicron variants was calculated using serum-to-lung ELF 
penetration values of 1% (as previously used) which is considered a conservative measure and 
supported. 
Simulation results following SD treatment with 1200 mg, 2400 mg and 8000 mg indicate that: 
- For all dose levels (1200 mg to 8000 mg), all hospitalized patients with a body weight ranging from 
40 kg to 160 kg have a concentration of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum that exceeds the 
ta-IC90 for 14 days after dosing, irrespective of disease severity. 
- For the 1200 mg IV dose, outlier patients with body weights ≥ 80 kg have concentrations of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum at or below the ta-IC90 values at 28 days post dosing 
regardless of oxygen group. 
Page 66/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
- For the 2400 mg IV dosing at 28 days, outlier patients in the high-flow oxygen group with body 
weights ≥ 80 kg have concentrations of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum at or below the ta-
IC90 values. 
- For the 8000 mg IV dose, all hospitalized patients regardless of oxygen group and body weight have 
a concentration of casirivimab+imdevimab combined in serum that exceed the ta-IC90 for 28 days 
after dosing. 
Simulation results of the PK simulation indicate that the 8000 mg IV dose for patients on high-flow 
oxygen are expected to provide maximal antiviral effect against all known pre-Omicron circulating 
variants over a 28-day period in individual patients (40 kg to 160 kg). 
Considering all the data submitted, the 8000 mg IV dose for treatment is considered a recommendable 
dose for the treatment of patients receiving oxygen. 
“Hospitalization” as indicator per se is not considered to meaningfully impact the PK, thus, should not 
be used for defining the posology statement in Section 4.2 of the SmPC as primarily indicated by the 
MAH. However, as indicated above supplemental oxygen use seems to have a significant impact on 
pharmacokinetic parameters associated with the efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab and therefore 
4000 mg IV is the optimal dose for patients receiving supplemental oxygen (including low flow and 
high flow oxygen devices, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) 
For patients who are not receiving oxygen the recommended posology is 600 mg of casirivimab and 
600 mg of imdevimab as it was authorised previously based on the data from COV-2067: A Master 
Protocol Assessing the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Anti-Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal 
Antibodies for the Treatment of Ambulatory Patients with COVID-19 (Study COV-2067) 
Therefore, the CHMP recommended to update 4.2 of the SmPC as recorded below: 
The dosage in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen is 600 mg of casirivimab and 
600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous 
injection (see Tables 1 and 3). See sections 4.4 and 5.1. For these patients only, casirivimab 
with imdevimab should be given within 7 days of the onset of symptoms of COVID-19. 
The dosage in patients who require supplemental oxygen (including low flow and high flow 
oxygen devices, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) is 
4000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous 
infusion (see Table 2 of Ronapreve SmPC 120 mg/mL + 120 mg/mL). See section 5. 
The proposal is accepted by the company and the SmPC updated accordingly. 
2.3.6.  
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK and PD data (viral load) from COV-2066 supported the adequate description of casirivimab and 
imdevimab PK by pop PK over a comprehensive over 10-fold dose range up to 4000 mg of each 
monoclonal antibody. 
Data from RECOVERY (pivotal study) and COV-2066 (supportive) have been collected informing the 
clinical pharmacology in the hospitalization setting, following the total dose of 8000 mg IV (RECOVERY) 
and in addition 2400 mg IV (COV-2066). 
Dose selection and dose justification based on PD marker viral load is hampered by the lack of dose 
and exposure-response relationships with respect to virologic efficacy and no definite link to the clinical 
outcome. Thus, results from RECOVERY following 8000 mg IV only are considered pivotal for 
considering posology conclusion. 
Based on the totality of data from pivotal and supportive studies informing the pharmacology and 
given that the need for oxygen supply in contrast to the hospitalization status is indicated to have an 
impact on PK, in was concluded that the 8000 mg IV (4000 mg of casirivimab and 4000 mg of 
imdevimab administered together as a single IV infusion) dose for treatment is considered a 
recommendable dose for the treatment of patients receiving oxygen (low-flow and high-flow).  
Page 67/173 
 
  
 
 
 
For patients who do not require oxygen supply the previously authorized dose of 600 mg of casirivimab 
and 600 mg of imdevimab administered together as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous 
injection is recommended, in line with the out-patient setting. 
2.4.   Clinical efficacy 
RECOVERY and COV-2066 provide information on the role of casirivimab+imdevimab for the treatment 
of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while RECOVERY is considered as pivotal study, COV-2066 is 
supportive.

Main studies 
RECOVERY 
In March 2020, when the original RECOVERY trial protocol was released by the University of Oxford (at 
the same time that the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic), there were no approved 
treatments for COVID-19. The UK New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group 
(NERVTAG) and WHO expert group advised that several possible treatments should be evaluated, 
including existing drugs repurposed for COVID-19 as well as emerging investigational treatments that 
require evaluation. As such, the protocol was designed to provide reliable assessments of the effects of 
multiple different treatments (including re-purposed and novel drugs) on major outcomes in COVID-19 
and allowed for treatment arms to be added or removed according to the emerging evidence. A 
factorial randomization was utilized to compare the selected treatments with usual care. 
Page 68/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
To facilitate collaboration, even in hospitals that suddenly become overloaded, patient enrolment (via 
the internet) and all other trial procedures are greatly streamlined. Informed consent is simple and 
data entry is minimal. 
Methods 
RECOVERY is an investigator-initiated, individually randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial in 
which several treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The 
multicenter study was conducted in the UK, Indonesia, and Nepal, with 127 hospitals in the UK taking 
part in the evaluation of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria included: 
●  Hospitalization 
●  Clinically suspected or PCR laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection associated disease 
●  No medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at 
significant risk if he/she were to participate in the trial 
The key exclusion criteria included: 
● 
Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment during the current hospital admission 
●  Children weighing <40 kg or aged <12 years 
Treatments 
REGN-COV 
Single 8000 mg dose (casirivimab 4000 mg and imdevimab 4000 mg)  
Treatments on top of SOC 
Patients could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care 
●  azithromycin versus usual care (Part A; 7 April 2020 – 27 November 2020) 
● 
colchicine versus usual care (Part A; 19 November 2020 – 5 March 2021) 
●  dimethyl fumarate versus usual care (Part A; 15 February 2021 – ongoing) 
●  aspirin versus usual care (Part C; 1 November 2020 – 21 March 2021) 
●  baricitinib versus usual care (Part D; 26 January 2021 – ongoing) 
Until 24 January 2021, the trial also allowed a subsequent randomisation for patients with progressive 
COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia and a hyper-inflammatory state) to tocilizumab versus usual care.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Sample size 
According to the study protocol, realistic, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated at the start 
of the trial. According to the supplementary statistical methods, on 27 April 2021, the Trial Steering 
Committee, whose members were unaware of the results of the trial comparisons, determined that, 
with over 9700 patients recruited to the REGEN-COV comparison and average daily recruitment of 4 
patients, further recruitment was unlikely to increase the reliability of the results materially so should 
discontinue. At that point, the Trial Steering Committee estimated that once follow-up of all patients 
was complete there would be at least 90% power at two-sided P=0.01 to detect a proportional 
reduction in 28-day mortality of 20% in the seronegative patients and of 15% in the overall study 
population. 
Page 70/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
A single participant could be randomised at most to 1 arm from each of part A, B, C, D and E of the 
factorial randomisations (depending on location), and thus receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top 
of usual standard of care. 
Alongside the casirivimab+imdevimab evaluation, as stated above, participants could be 
simultaneously randomized to the following treatment groups in the Main Randomization: 
●  azithromycin versus no additional treatment (Part A; 7 April 2020 – 27 November 2020) 
● 
colchicine versus no additional treatment (Part A; 19 November 2020 – 5 March 2021) 
●  dimethyl fumarate versus no additional treatment (Part A; 15 February 2021 – ongoing) 
●  aspirin versus no additional treatment (Part C; 1 November 2020 – 21 March 2021) 
●  baricitinib versus no additional treatment (Part D; 26 January 2021 – ongoing) 
Further, participants could be randomized to receiving tocilizumab or no additional treatment on top of 
those treatments above, in a second randomization. 
● 
tocilizumab versus no additional treatment (second randomization; 14 April 2020 – 24 January 
2021)

Blinding (masking) 
RECOVERY was an open-label study and no placebo comparator was administered in an effort to 
minimize trial procedures; therefore, participants, investigators, and local study staff were not blinded 
to the allocated treatment. The Trial Steering Committee, investigators, and all other individuals 
involved in the trial were masked to outcome data during the trial, however, the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (iDMC) was not. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis set 
Comparisons were planned to be made between all patients randomized to the different treatment 
arms, irrespective of whether they received their allocated treatment (“intention-to-treat” analyses). 
The primary analysis for regn-cov-2 was planned to be conducted in seronegative patients only. 
Pairwise comparisons within each randomisation were planned to be made between each treatment 
arm and the no additional treatment arm (reference group) in that particular randomisation (main 
randomisation part A, B, C or D, and second randomisation). However, since not all treatments might 
have been available or suitable for all patients, those in the no additional treatment arm were planned 
to be included in a given comparison only if, at the point of their randomisation, they could 
alternatively have been randomised to the active treatment of interest. 
Primary outcome variable and analysis model  
For the primary outcome of 28-day mortality, the log-rank observed minus expected statistic and its 
variance were planned to be used to test the null hypothesis of equal survival curves (ie, the log-rank 
test) and to calculate the one-step estimate of the average mortality rate ratio. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves were planned to be constructed to display cumulative mortality over the 28-day period. 
The main analyses described above were planned to be unadjusted for baseline characteristics. 
Missing values and censoring 
For the primary outcome (death within 28 days of randomisation), discharge alive before 28 days was 
planned to assume safety from the event (unless there is additional data confirming otherwise). 
Significance level and Multiplicity  
Evaluation of the primary trial (main randomisation) and secondary randomisation was planned to be 
conducted independently, and no adjustments have been made for these. Formal adjustments were 
not planned for multiple treatment comparisons, the testing of secondary and subsidiary outcomes, or 
subgroup analyses. 
The primary outcome was planned to first be assessed among participants who are known to be 
seronegative at randomisation. If the null hypothesis is rejected in the seronegative group at 2-tailed 
p=0.05, then the primary outcome was planned to be assessed among the whole population (i.e. 
seronegative, seropositive, and those with unknown status combined). Otherwise, no further 
hypothesis testing was planned to be performed. 
A similar approach was planned to be taken for each of the two pre-specified secondary outcomes 
(discharge alive within 28 days and, among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, 
the use of invasive mechanical ventilation or death) if both primary hypotheses are rejected. 
Hypothesis testing was planned to first be conducted among the participants who are known to be 
seronegative at randomisation and, if the null hypothesis is rejected at 2-tailed p=0.025, then it was 
planned to be assessed among the whole population (see Table). 
Page 73/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Interim analysis 
The independent Data Monitoring Committee was planned to review unblinded analyses of the study 
data and any other information considered relevant at intervals of around 2 to 4 weeks. The committee 
was charged with determining if, in their view, the randomised comparisons in the study provide 
evidence on mortality that is strong enough (with a range of uncertainty around the results that was 
narrow enough) to affect national and global treatment strategies. In such a circumstance, the 
Committee was planned to inform the Steering Committee who would make the results available to the 
public and amend the trial arms accordingly. Unless that happened, the Steering Committee, 
investigators, and all others involved in the trial were planned to remain blinded to the interim results 
until 28 days after the last patient had been randomised to a particular intervention arm. 
The Data Monitoring Committee determined that to consider recommending stopping a treatment early 
for benefit would require at least a 3 to 3·5 standard error reduction in mortality. The Committee 
concluded that examinations of the data at every 10% (or even 5%) of the total data would lead to 
only a marginal increase in the overall type I error rate. 
Subgroup analysis  
Tests for heterogeneity (or tests for trend for 3 or more ordered groups) were planned to be conducted 
to assess whether there is any good evidence that the effects in particular subgroups differ materially 
from the overall effect seen in all patients combined. Results were planned to be presented on forest 
plots as event rate ratios, or risk ratios, with confidence intervals. The following subgroups were 
planned to be examined based on information at randomization: 
●  Age (<70; 70-79; 80+ years) 
●  Sex (Male; Female) 
Page 74/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
●  Ethnicity (White; Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic) 
●  Region (UK, non-UK) 
●  Time since illness onset (≤7 days; >7 days) 
●  Requirement for respiratory support 
o  For main randomisation: None; Oxygen only; Non-invasive ventilation; Invasive 
mechanical ventilation (including ECMO) 
o  For second randomisation: No ventilator support (including no or low-flow oxygen); 
Non-invasive ventilation (including CPAP, other non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow 
nasal oxygen), Invasive mechanical ventilation (including ECMO) 
●  Use of systemic corticosteroid (including dexamethasone) 
●  For part B only: Recipient anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration at randomization (<8 x106 
units; ≥8 x106 units). (This will be the key subgroup for the REGN-COV2 comparison.)

Important changes to the analysis plan 
Initially the primary analysis was planned to be conducted in all randomized patients, but this 
was amended in SAP version 3.0 to be restricted to seronegatives only, with all randomized 
patients second in hierarchy. According to the applicant, the decision was made without 
knowledge of the study data.

Results 
Participant flow 
Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 11,464 of 24,343 participants (47%) enrolled into the 
RECOVERY trial were eligible to be randomly allocated to receive casirivimab+imdevimab.  
From the 11,464 participants who were eligible for randomization to casirivimab+imdevimab, 9785 
were randomized between casirivimab+imdevimab (4839 participants) and the usual care group (4946 
participants). Of these, 28 withdrew consent in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 18 in the usual 
care group.

A higher number of participants proceeded to second randomization in the usual care group (535 
participants) compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab group (374 participants). In total, 4839 
participants were included in the 28-day ITT analysis in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 4946 
participants in the usual care group.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in the UK, Indonesia, and Nepal, with 127 hospitals in the UK taking part in 
the evaluation of casirivimab+imdevimab.  
Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021 the REGEN-COV arm was open. All participants in the 
REGN-COV arm were enrolled at sites in the UK.

Baseline data 
The participants’ demographic characteristics including age, sex, and race/ethnicity were balanced 
between the treatment groups for the seronegative group and among all randomized participants. 
Among all randomized participants at baseline, 54% were seropositive, 34% were seronegative, and 
14% had an unknown serostatus. 
Seronegative patients 
Among participants that were seronegative at baseline, the mean age was 63.2 years (standard 
deviation [SD] 15.5) in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 64.0 years (SD 15.2) in the usual care 
alone group. The majority were male (61% and 58%) and White (81% and 82%).  
Page 80/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The baseline disease characteristics of the seronegative participants were mostly similar to those 
reported for all randomized participants. Differences observed in seronegative participants when 
compared to all randomized participants, albeit numerically small, included a shorter time from 
symptom onset (median 7 days) and a higher proportion of participants receiving no oxygen (~11%) 
and simple oxygen (~66%). Similar proportions of participants were randomized to azithromycin, 
aspirin and colchichine as per all the randomized group. 
All randomised patients 
Among all randomized participants, the mean age was 61.9 years (SD 14.6) in the casirivimab + 
imdevimab and usual care alone group. The majority of participants were male (63%) and White 
(~78%). 
Both treatment groups had a median of 9 days from symptom onset and a median of 2 days since 
admission to hospital. Most participants received simple oxygen support (62% casirivimab+imdevimab 
vs. 61% usual care alone) followed by non-invasive ventilation (26% vs. 27%).  
The frequency of comorbidities in the casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care groups was similar (53% 
vs. 54%), and the most common comorbidities were diabetes, chronic lung disease, and heart disease, 
the proportions of which were similar between the treatment groups.  
Of the other treatments participants could be randomized to as part of the main randomization A, B, C 
and D, very few participants received azithromycin (3% for both groups), 28% received aspirin in both 
groups and 22% of those randomized to casirivimab+imdevimab vs. 23% to the usual care group 
received colchichine. 
Numbers analysed 
The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among patients without detectable 
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation (seronegative) and then in the overall population.  
9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, 
including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) 
patients with unknown baseline antibody status.

28-day All-cause Mortality 
Among participants who were seronegative at baseline, there was a statistically significant relative 
reduction of 20% in 28-day all-cause mortality among participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
group compared to participants receiving usual care alone, 24% (396/1633 participants) died in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group vs. 30% (451/1520 participants) in the usual care group (rate ratio: 
0.80; 95% CI: 0.70–0·91; p=0.001).  
Among all randomized participants (including those who were seronegative, seropositive and 
serostatus unknown), there was no significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality between the two 
groups: 20% (944/4839 participants) of participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 
21% (1026/4946 participants) of participants in the usual care alone group (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI: 
0.86 to 1.03; p=0.17) 
28-day mortality was also assessed in participants who were seropositive at baseline. There was little 
difference in the 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups: 16% (411/2636) of participants 
in the seropositive casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 15% (383/2636) of participants in the 
usual care alone group (rate ratio 1.09; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.26) (Figure 2, Figure 3). The proportional 
effect of casirivimab+imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between participants who were 
seronegative and seropositive at baseline (test for heterogeneity, p=0.001).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Discharge alive from hospital 
Among seronegative participants, discharge alive within 28 days was more common among 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared with the usual care group (64% vs. 58%; 
risk ratio: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.30; median 13 days, interquartile range [IQR] 7 to >28 vs. 17 days 
[IQR 7 to >28]) (Table 11, Figure 3). 
Among all randomized participants, there was no meaningful difference observed in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group compared with the usual care group in discharge alive within 28 days 
(70% vs. 69%; rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.07; median 10 days [IQR 6 to >28] vs. 10 days 
[IQR 5 to >28]) (Table 12, Figure 3). 
Use of invasive mechanical ventilation or death among patients not on invasive mechanical 
ventilation at randomization  
Among seronegative participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group had a lower risk of progressing to the composite secondary outcome of 
invasive mechanical ventilation or death (30% vs. 37%, risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.92) (Table 
11, Figure 3). However, there was little difference observed among all randomized participants (24% 
vs. 25%, risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.04) (Table 12, Figure 3). 
For each secondary efficacy endpoint described above, there was clear evidence that the proportional 
effects differed between seropositive and seronegative participants (p value for heterogeneity <0.001 
for both endpoints) (Figure 3). 
Subsidiary Clinical Outcomes 
Use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation among patients not on any ventilation at 
randomization 
Seronegative participants receiving casirivimab+imdevimab were less likely to progress to the use of 
ventilation among those who were not receiving ventilation at baseline versus participant in the usual 
care group (28% vs. 32%; risk ratio 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.98) (Table 11, Figure 3). This was not 
observed in the overall study population (23% vs. 24%; risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.04) (Table 
12, Figure 3). 
When evaluating the use of non-invasive ventilation and use of invasive mechanical ventilation 
separately, seronegative participants who received casirivimab+imdevimab were less likely to progress 
using either form of ventilatory support (use of noninvasive ventilation: 27% vs. 31%, risk ratio 0.85, 
95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; use of invasive mechanical ventilation: 7% vs. 10%, risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 
0.52 to 0.88) (Table 11). However, this was not observed in the overall study population (use of non-
invasive ventilation: 22% vs. 23%, risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.04; use of invasive mechanical 
ventilation: 5% vs. 6%, risk ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.04) (Table 12). 
Page 85/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of renal dialysis or hemofiltration 
Among seronegative participants not receiving renal replacement therapy at randomization, there was 
no meaningful difference in the use of renal replacement therapy among participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group versus the usual care group (4% in both groups, risk ratio 0.98, 95% 
CI: 0.71 to 1.38) (Table 11). No difference between the groups was seen in the overall population (4% 
in both groups, risk ratio 1.03, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.25) (Table 12). 
Ancillary analyses 
As the participants with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could enrol without PCR laboratory-
confirmation as well as those with a positive test, an analysis was undertaken on those with a positive 
SARS-COV-2 PCR test at baseline. In seronegative participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, a 
similar mortality rate ratio to the main analysis was observed (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70-0.91) in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab group. Using a Cox model adjusted for all pre-specified subgroups, 
allocation to casirivimab+imdevimab was associated with a mortality rate ratio of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74 
to 0.98) in seronegative participants (table below). 
Subgroup analysis 
Among seronegative participants, the reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group was consistent across all other pre-specified subgroups (age, sex, 
ethnicity, days since symptom onset, respiratory support received and use of corticosteroids) (Figure 
5). 
Page 86/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Most of the pre-specified subgroup analysis results among all randomized participants did not exclude 
1 for the rate ratio comparisons between casirivimab+imdevimab and the usual care group alone for 
28-day all-cause mortality (Figure 6), discharge alive from hospital (Figure 7), and progression to 
invasive mechanical ventilation or death (Figure 8). The subgroup analyses were broadly consistent 
with the result observed for the endpoints described in all participants (Figure 3).

Notes 
P-value 
Not reported 
RECOVERY met its pre-specified primary endpoint for 28-day all-cause 
mortality. Among participants who were seronegative at baseline, there was a 
statistically significant relative reduction of 20% in 28-day all-cause mortality 
among participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared to 
participants receiving usual care alone, 24% (396/1633 participants) died in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab group vs. 30% (451/1520 participants) in the 
usual care group (rate ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70–0·91; p=0.001).  
Among all randomized participants (including those who were seronegative, 
seropositive and serostatus unknown), there was no significant difference in 
28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups: 20% (944/4839 
participants) of participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 
21% (1026/4946 participants) of participants in the usual care alone group 
(rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03; p=0.17).  
Although not part of the testing hierarchy, 28-day mortality was also assessed 
in participants who were seropositive at baseline. There was little difference in 
the 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups: 16% (411/2636) of 
participants in the seropositive casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 
15% (383/2636) of participants in the usual care alone group (rate ratio 1.09; 
95% CI: 0.95 to 1.26). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The demonstration of the clinical and virologic efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab for the treatment of 
hospitalized participants with COVID-19 consists of data from two studies: the pivotal RECOVERY trial 
and the supportive COV-2066 study. An integrated analysis of efficacy was not performed across these 
studies due to the following reasons: 
●  The Sponsor of each trial (University of Oxford for RECOVERY and Regeneron for COV-2066) 
did not collect data in a similar way that would allow for integration between the two studies. 
●  The disease characteristics of the participants in the efficacy analysis populations, as evidenced 
by the respiratory support received, were different between the studies. The population in 
RECOVERY included participants across the full disease spectrum of hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19 (no supplemental oxygen, simple oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive 
mechanical ventilation [including ECMO]), whereas the population in COV-2066 included those 
on no supplemental oxygen or on low-flow supplemental oxygen. 
●  The efficacy endpoints within the studies were sufficiently different. In RECOVERY the primary 
endpoint was mortality at Day 28, with secondary endpoints including discharge from hospital 
and progression to mechanical ventilation or death as part of the testing hierarchy. In COV-
2066 there was a primary virological endpoint (reduction in viral load from Day 1 to Day 7) 
and a primary clinical endpoint (progression to mechanical ventilation or death) that was 
tested across different analysis populations in the testing hierarchy. 
●  RECOVERY was adequately powered to demonstrate clinical efficacy, whereas COV-2066 was 
prematurely discontinued. 
Comparison across trials 
Key inclusion and exclusion criteria 
RECOVERY was inclusive of participants regardless of their time from symptom onset to randomization 
or time from hospital admission to randomization. In an effort to enrol participants as soon as possible 
into the severe COVID-19 disease course, COV-2066 required participants to be < 10 days of COVID-
19 symptom onset and hospitalized for < 72 hours. 
RECOVERY was designed to enrol participants across the full range of COVID-19 disease severity in the 
hospitalized population, regardless of the type of respiratory support required. Ultimately and due to 
Page 95/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
changes in the study conduct, COV-2066 primarily enrolled participants towards the lower end of 
disease severity that required no supplemental oxygen or low-flow supplemental oxygen. 
Demographics 
Overall, the between treatment group baseline characteristics were balanced in both RECOVERY and 
COV-2066. Among all randomized participants who received casirivimab+imdevimab, over half were 
male (63% and 54.4%), most were White (78% and 63.4%), and the median age was 61.9 years and 
61.3 years in RECOVERY and COV-2066 respectively.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
In the overall trial population, the proportion of enrolled participants with a negative SARS-COV-2 
antibody test (i.e., seronegative) was lower in RECOVERY (34% vs. 31% in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab vs. usual care alone groups) compared to the COV-2066 study (44.8% vs. 
40.7% in the combined doses vs. placebo). Furthermore, a greater proportion had a positive (i.e., 
seropositive) and unknown SARS-COV-2 antibody test result in RECOVERY compared to COV-2066.  
Most participants in RECOVERY received simple oxygen support (62% vs. 61% in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab vs. usual care alone groups) followed by non-invasive ventilation (26% vs. 
27% in the casirivimab+imdevimab vs. usual care alone groups). A smaller proportion of participants 
received invasive mechanical ventilation (6% in both the casirivimab+imevimab and usual care alone 
groups) or no supplemental oxygen (7% vs. 6% in the casirivimab+imdevimab vs. usual care alone 
groups). In COV-2066, 56.1% of the participants in the efficacy population received low-flow 
supplemental oxygen and 43.9% received no oxygen.  
Page 96/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The median time from symptom onset to baseline was longer in RECOVERY compared to COV-2066 (9 
days [IQR 6-12] vs. 5 days [IQR 4-8]) (table below). This was expected as RECOVERY was inclusive of 
participants regardless of their time from symptom onset. 
Outcome 
Key clinical efficacy results supporting the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 are 
summarised below in a comparative manner for both studies. The efficacy outcomes in this section is 
for the 8000 mg IV dose in RECOVERY and the combined (2400 mg and 8000 mg) IV dose group for 
COV-2066.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Not applicable 
Supportive study 
●  Study COV-2066 
COV-2066 was an adaptive Phase 1/2/3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to 
exclude futility (Phase 1/2) and evaluate efficacy and safety (Phase 3) of casirivimab+imdevimab in 
hospitalised adult and adolescent patients with COVID-19. The study was the first-in-human clinical 
trial for the combination mAb therapy product (casirivimab and imdevimab). 
On 09 Apr 2021, owing to low recruitment rates, the Sponsor made a decision to close enrolment into 
the study. The reason for early termination was not based on safety concerns, but due to low 
recruitment rates over the preceding 3 months. All participants were followed through to their end of 
study visit according to the protocol, and the last participant last visit date for the main study was 04 
Jun 2021. 
A subset of cohort 1 and cohort 1A participants at select study sites in the US are enrolled in an 
ongoing long COVID sub-study. Results from this sub-study will be reported at a later time. 
The final CSR is based on a database lock date of 08 Jul 2021. This represents the final data for the 
main study.

*Note: Per IDMC recommendation first received on 30 October 2020, and reiterated through19 
February 2021, patient enrolment in cohort 2 and cohort 3 has been placed on hold. 
The study was initiated before the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and, after their authorization; 
enrolment was permitted of vaccinated individuals who had breakthrough COVID-19. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
●

●  Receiving ECMO 
●  Had new-onset stroke or seizure disorder during hospitalization 
● 
Initiated on renal replacement therapy due to COVID-19 
●  Had circulatory shock requiring vasopressors at randomization (Note: Patients who required 
vasopressors for sedation-related hypotension or reasons other than circulatory shock may 
have been eligible in this study) 
●  Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
●  Received convalescent plasma, IVIG, or mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. bamlanivimab) within 
5 months prior to randomization or plan to receive during the study period for any indication 
Treatments  
Patients were randomized in each cohort in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a one-time infusion of 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg, casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg, or placebo, all given in addition 
to the local standard of care. 
Standard-of-Care background treatments 
Patients may receive the standard-of-care for the treatment of COVID-19 per local guidelines. 
Background treatments may include: 
●  Antiviral therapies (remdesivir or other) 
Page 102/173 
 
  
 
 
 
● 
Immune-based therapies (tocilizumab, sarilumab, steroids, or other) 
●  Antiviral and immune-based therapies 
Patients who have received convalescent plasma, IVIG, or mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g, 
bamlanivimab) within 5 months prior to randomization or plan to receive during the study period for 
any indication were excluded from the study (Exclusion criterion 7). 
Study design 
Phase 1. In the FIH phase 1 portion of the study, only participants on low-flow oxygen 
supplementation (cohort 1) were enrolled.  
The aim of the Phase 1 portion of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
casirivimab+imdevimab in hospitalized participants; therefore, only participants on low flow oxygen 
supplementation (Cohort 1 i.e., those on low flow oxygen) were enrolled. Phase 1 included a sentinel 
safety group where the initial safety data up to Study Day 3 was reviewed by an iDMC. Participants in 
this sentinel safety group were derived from 2 concurrent first in human studies where the safety and 
tolerability of casirivimab+imdevimab was evaluated,including COV-2066 (Cohort 1 only) and Study 
R10933-10987-COV-2067 in outpatients with COVID-19. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3.  
Phase 2 was initiated following IDMC clearance of the sentinel safety group and enrolled concurrently 
with phase 1. 
Page 103/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 2 and Phase 3: This initially included enrolment for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, and then included 
enrolment to Cohort 1A following protocol amendment 5. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy analysis 
For the efficacy analyses, since the overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to early study 
termination, study cohorts (Phase 3 Cohort 1 and Phase 2 Cohort 1A) and casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose groups (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) were pooled for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Page 104/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical order. 
Sample size 
Cohort 1A (phase 2 part) 
The sample size of phase 2 cohort 1A was adjusted to approximate 1000 patients based on clinical 
judgement without statistical justification. However, this target was not reached because the 
enrollment was prematurely terminated due to slow enrolment rate. 
Phase 3 (Cohort 1) 
Initial estimation 
The sample size for phase 3 was initially estimated to be 1350 patients (150 patients per arm across 3 
treatment arms in 3 cohorts). Based on the new endpoint of death or mechanical ventilation, the 
sample size for phase 3 has been re-estimated to be 2505 patients in each of cohort 1 and cohort 1A. 
The study was planned to continue enrolling additional patients seamlessly into the phase 3 portion of 
the study, until an adaptation decision on the dose(s), primary endpoint, and final sample size for 
Page 105/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
phase 3 is made based on the phase 2 data analysis. A total sample size of approximately 5010 
patients was estimated for the phase 3 portion of the study (2505 per cohort, 835 per arm across 3 
treatment arms in 2 cohorts). For cohort 1, a total of 241 events (estimated sample size of 2505 
patients [835 patients per arm]) would have been needed to provide 90% power at α=0.05 (2-sided) 
using a log-rank test to detect a risk reduction of 35.8% (i.e., HR=0.642) in the cumulative incidence 
of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation, assuming a 12.5% cumulative incidence rate in 
the placebo group by day 29. 
Final sample size 
Finalization of the sample size and patient population for phase 3 was planned to be subject to change 
and would be determined after review of phase 2 data. However, enrolment of patients into the study 
was terminated prematurely by the Sponsor on 09 April 2021 because of extremely slow enrolment in 
the months preceding the decision. The sample size of phase 3 was not re-estimated. 
Randomisation 
Patients entering the trial had varying degrees of oxygen support at randomization and this 
determined their categorization into 1 of 4 cohorts for analyses: 
●  Patients who required no supplemental oxygen support (Cohort 1A). 
●  Patients who had O2 saturation >93% on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, simple face 
mask, or another similar device (Cohort 1). 
●  Patients who required high-intensity oxygen supplementation (Cohort 2). High-intensity 
oxygen therapy was defined as the use of non-rebreather mask with an oxygen flow rate of at 
least 10 L/min; use of a high flow device with at least 50% FiO2, or use of non-invasive 
ventilation to treat hypoxemia. 
●  Patients who were mechanically ventilated (Cohort 3). 
Phase 1. In the FIH phase 1 portion of the study, only participants on low-flow oxygen 
supplementation (cohort 1) were enrolled.  
Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to a single intravenous (IV) dose of casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 
mg, casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg, or matching placebo. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3.  
Phase 2 was initiated following IDMC clearance of the sentinel safety group and enrolled concurrently 
with phase 1.  
Page 106/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Participants of varying disease severity were randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg, casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg, or placebo. 
Cohort 1 participants who were randomized after 01 Dec 2020 were considered part of phase 3. 
Randomization was planned to be stratified by country and type of background standard-of-care being 
administered for COVID-19 at randomization as follows: 
●  Those who received antiviral therapies only (e.g., remdesivir, favipiravir)  
●  All other participants, including those receiving no therapy, non-antiviral therapy for COVID-19 
(e.g., systemic corticosteroids or hydroxychloroquine), or antiviral therapy in combination with 
non-antiviral therapy  
Blinding (masking) 
Pharmacist or qualified personnel at the site, not otherwise associated with the conduct of the study, 
was planned to reconstitute the drug for IV administration. The drug infusion solution must be 
provided in identical form for active and placebo treatments, so that they remain indistinguishable to 
both study personnel and patients. 
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel (with the exception of the 
unblinded pharmacist at each site) were planned to remain blinded to all randomization assignments 
throughout the study. The Regeneron medical/study director, study monitor, and any other Regeneron 
and contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact with the study site 
were planned to remain blinded to all patient randomization assignments in all phases of the study. 
Selected individuals from the Sponsor not involved in the conduct of the study may have access to 
unblinded phase 1 or phase 2 data as needed for safety review or other data review. The team 
performing the interim data reviews was planned to be separate from the ongoing study team. No 
study personnel involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study was planned to have access to any 
unblinded data before the database is locked for this study. 
Anti-drug antibody, drug concentration, and biomarker results were not communicated to the sites, 
and the Sponsor’s blinded operational team was not planned to have access to results associated with 
patient identification until after the database is locked.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were performed in the following analysis sets: 
●  Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS included all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of the study drug. Analysis of the FAS population was performed according to the 
treatment allocated (as randomized). The FAS was identical to the Safety Analysis Set.  
●  Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS): The mFAS included all FAS patients with a positive RT-qPCR 
from a central NP swab samples at randomization and analysis was based on the treatment 
allocated (as randomized). 
●  Seronegative mFAS: The seronegative mFAS was defined as all randomized patients with 
documented seronegative status at baseline in mFAS, respectively. 
Note: Seronegativity at baseline required that all non-missing baseline serology test results to 
be negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., anti-S1 IgA, anti-S1 IgG, and anti-N IgG) 
in order to be considered negative. 
●  Seropositive mFAS: The seropositive mFAS was defined as all randomized patients with 
documented seropositive status at baseline in mFAS, respectively. 
●  High Viral Load mFAS: The High Viral Load mFAS is defined as all patients in mFAS with 
baseline viral load >106 copies/mL. 
Both the FAS and mFAS were used for the summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics and 
analysis of clinical/biomarker endpoints. The mFAS was used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints, 
based on the principle that an anti-viral agent would only be anticipated to provide efficacy in patients 
with measurable virus at baseline. The Seronegative mFAS and the High Viral Load mFAS were used 
for the primary analysis and descriptive analysis of certain virologic endpoints and clinical endpoints. 
Additional analyses were performed in the Seropositive mFAS, as needed. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The efficacy analyses were planned to be performed for the following patients on all efficacy endpoints, 
separately. The comparisons in all efficacy endpoints were planned to be performed between the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo group as well as between 
each treatment group and placebo group. 
●  Pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A patients 
●  Phase 3 cohort 1 patients (ie, patients randomized after 01 December 2020 in cohort 1) 
●  Phase 2 cohort 1A patients 
Analysis of Primary Virologic Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary analysis on the comparison between the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g 
combined dose group and placebo with respect to the virologic endpoint of time-weighted average 
daily change from baseline in viral load (log10 copies/mL) from day 1 to day 7 and other postbaseline 
visit timepoint was planned to be performed in the Seronegative mFAS in the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 
and phase 2 cohort 1A patients. The estimand for the analysis is the difference in means between the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo in the pooled phase 3 
cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A patients. Data collected after use of convalescent plasma therapy or 
other anti-spike monoclonals were planned to be excluded from efficacy analysis. All other available 
data were planned to be used in the analysis regardless of intercurrent events such as rescue 
medication or discontinuation, i.e., treatment policy approach. 
The analysis was planned to be based on the observed data with no imputation for missing data except 
as defined in the SAP for viral load values that are below lower limit of detection (<LLOD), below lower 
limit of quantification (<LLOQ) or above upper limit of quantification (>ULOQ) of the assay. 
The variable was planned to be analyzed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatment group and the type of background standard-of-care as fixed effects, and baseline viral load 
and treatment by baseline interaction as covariates. 
Page 108/173 
 
  
 
 
 
The least squares mean estimates for time-weighted average daily change from baseline in viral load 
for each treatment group, as well as the difference between the REGN10933+REGN10987 2.4g and 
8.0g combined doses and placebo as well as between each individual dose treatment group and 
placebo, were planned to be provided along with the corresponding two-sided p-value, standard error, 
and associated 95% confidence interval. 
Analysis of Primary Clinical Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy analysis was planned to be the comparison between the REGN10933+REGN10987 
2.4g and 8.0g combined dose group and placebo in the pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A 
patients. The primary clinical endpoint defined in Section 4.1 was to be analyzed using the landmark 
analysis approach for day 6 through day 29, as well as analyzed for day 1 through day 29 in the order 
specified below. 
The proportion of patients who died or went on mechanical ventilation was planned to be analyzed 
using either the exact method for binomial distribution or asymptotic normal approximation method. If 
the number of events is small (eg, np ≤ 5 or n(1-p) ≤ 5 in any treatment group, where n is the 
number of patients in the treatment group and p is the proportion of events), then the Fisher’s exact 
test was planned to be applied. Otherwise, stratified Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by 
the type of background standard-of-care (antiviral therapies and non-antiviral therapies), was to be 
applied. Relative risk and relative risk reduction and corresponding 95% confidence intervals compared 
to placebo group were planned to be estimated by Farrington-Manning method. Missing data was 
planned to be considered as non-events. 
The analysis was to be performed for the High Viral Load mFAS, the Seronegative mFAS, and the 
overall mFAS. 
Control of Multiplicity 
The following multiplicity adjustment approach, a hierarchical procedure, was to be used to control the 
overall Type-1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary virologic and clinical outcome endpoints in comparison 
between the combined doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment group and placebo group in the 
pooled phase 3 cohort 1 and phase 2 cohort 1A patients. Each hypothesis was to be formally tested 
only if the preceding one is significant at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level.

Results 
Recruitment 
The majority of the patients were enrolled in the United States (87.6%) and the remaining participants 
were enrolled in Europe (~5% Romania and Moldova), Mexico (~5%) and South America (~4%, Brazil 
and Chile) 
Conduct of the study 
The following describes a timeline of key milestones in the study conduct relevant to the summary of 
results.

•  During Phase 2, on 29 Oct 2020, the study iDMC recommended pausing participant enrolment 
into Cohorts 2 and 3 based on a potential safety imbalance in the incidence of deaths among 
participants receiving casirivimab+imdevimab compared to the placebo group, while continuing 
with enrolment in Cohorts 1A and 1. All participants who had been enrolled in Cohorts 2 and 3 
up until that point were followed up through to the end of study visit on Study Day 57 as per 
the protocol. This iDMC recommendation to pause enrolment for Cohorts 2 and 3 was 
maintained for the duration of the study (Phases 2 and 3). 
•  A combined Phase 1/2 interim analysis was performed on participants who were randomized 
• 
through 01 December 2020 in Phase 1 (Cohort 1 only) and Phase 2 (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3). This 
interim analysis used a data cut-off date of 09 December 2020 and a database lock date of 22 
December 2020. The primary objective of the interim analysis was to exclude futility in the 
seronegative mFAS in Cohort 1, based on α=0.3 (1-sided). Futility was excluded (p=0.23) in 
Cohort 1. As Phase 2 enrolment of Cohort 2 and 3 was paused per iDMC recommendation, they 
were not included in the primary objective of the interim analysis. Phase 2 Cohort 1A was not 
included in the interim analysis as enrolment was still ongoing. 
The sample size for Phase 2 (390 participants per cohort) of the study was originally based on 
the primary virologic endpoint. Cohort 1 reached its Phase 2 enrolment goal before Cohort 1A 
did, and as a result, all participants enrolled into Cohort 1 after 01 December 2020 were 
considered to be part of Phase 3. Enrolment into Phase 2 Cohort 1A occurred concurrently with 
Phase 3 Cohort 1 enrolment, and the data were handled and overseen in a similar manner. 
•  On 09 April 2021, the Sponsor made a business decision to close enrolment in this study early 
due to low recruitment over the preceding 3 months prior to the surge in hospitalizations in the 
US associated with the emergence of the Delta variant. This early termination was not due to 
any safety concerns. Accordingly, Phase 3 Cohort 1 and Phase 2 Cohort 1A enrolment were 
prematurely terminated. All participants were followed up through their end of study visit 
according to the protocol, and the last participant last visit date for the main study was 04 Jun 
2021. 
Page 111/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Baseline data 
In the primary efficacy pool (pooled cohort 1 [phase 3] and cohort 1A; n=1197), demography and 
other baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced across all treatment and placebo groups 
in the Overall mFAS (see clinical summary: Table 17: Summary of Demographics and Baseline 
Characteristics (Pooled Cohort 1 [Phase 3] and Cohort 1A; mFAS). The main patient demographic 
characteristics and baseline disease characteristics are summarised below: 
Demography 
●  Most participants were greater than 40 years of age, with an overall median age of 62 years. 
There were more participants between 40 to 65 years of age in the treatment groups (49.6%) 
compared to the placebo group (40.5%). Slightly less than half of the participants (45.9%) 
were female. Most participants were White (62.6%). Black/African Americans (12.1%) and 
Asians (3.9%) were also represented. Overall, 30.1% of participants were Hispanic or Latino in 
ethnicity. 
●  The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.65 kg/m2, with 47.5% of the participants in the 
obese category (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). Overall, 21.5% of the participants were 
immunocompromised as having immunological diseases, immunodeficiencies, or being 
immunosuppressed; examples of medical history for this category include rheumatoid arthritis, 
solid organ transplantation, HIV, and cancer. 
Baseline disease characteristics 
●  Baseline SARS-CoV-2 viral load was similar across all treatment and placebo groups, with an 
overall median of 6.4 log10 copies/mL and 58.1% of the participants in the high viral load 
category (>106 copies/mL). 
●  Overall, 43.4% of the participants were seronegative at baseline (i.e., with all non-missing 
baseline serology test results negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [i.e., anti-S1 IgA, 
anti-S1 IgG, and anti-N IgG]). The proportion of seronegative participants was slightly higher 
in the combined treatment group (44.8%) versus the placebo group (40.78%). 
●  Overall, 47.6% of the participants were seropositive (i.e., with at least one positive anti- 
SARS-CoV-2 serology test result) at baseline. 71.8% of the seropositive participants were also 
positive for SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, as measured by a cell-based neutralization 
assay using recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) engineered to express the SARS-CoV-
2 S protein (Vandergaast, 2020). 
●  Other baseline disease characteristics (e.g., temperature, respiratory rate, clinical status) were 
similar across all treatment and placebo groups. 
Numbers analysed 
For the primary efficacy analysis population (pooled Phase 3 Cohort 1 and Phase 2 Cohort 1A), a total 
of 1364 participants were randomized, with 457 participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg 
IV group, 455 participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg IV arm and 452 participants in the 
placebo group. 
Page 112/173 
 
  
 
 
 
The number of participants included in each analysis set is summarized in Table 7 for the primary 
efficacy analysis population (i.e., pooled cohort 1 [phase 3] and cohort 1A).  
In key efficacy analysis sets, the number of participants and their cohort is shown below: 
●  Overall mFAS: 667 Cohort 1 participants and 530 Cohort 1A participants 
●  High Viral Load mFAS: 373 Cohort 1 participants and 323 Cohort 1A participants 
Page 113/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
●  Seronegative mFAS: 232 Cohort 1 participants and 288 Cohort 1A participants 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary Pooled Phase 3 (Cohort 1) and Phase 2 (Cohort 1A). 
The mFAS was used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints, based on the principle that an anti-viral 
agent would only be anticipated to provide efficacy in patients with measurable virus at baseline. The 
Seronegative mFAS and the High Viral Load mFAS were used for the primary analysis and descriptive 
analysis of certain virologic endpoints and clinical endpoints. Additional analyses were performed in the 
Seropositive mFAS, as needed. 
Page 114/173 
 
  
 
 
 
A pre-specified statistical hierarchy was used to test the virologic and clinical efficacy of 
casirivimab+imdevimab in the combined doses group (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) compared to 
placebo group, in pooled Cohort 1 (Phase 3) and Cohort 1A (Phase 2). 
The first primary endpoint (viral load reduction during the first week after treatment, in the 
Seronegative mFAS) was met (difference vs placebo of -0.28 log10 copies/mL, p=0.0172), but 
statistical testing terminated at the first clinical endpoint (reduction in death or mechanical ventilation 
from Day 6 to Day 29, in the High Viral Load mFAS) as it did not show a statistically significant 
treatment effect (RRR: 25.5%, p=0.2048).  
Page 115/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
When the observation period covered the whole efficacy period (Day 1 to Day 29), numeric reductions 
were observed in the proportion of participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation and all 
cause mortality in all populations of interest (High Viral Load mFAS, Seronegative mFAS and Overall 
mFAS).  
For the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints of mechanical ventilation, death or readmission and 
discharge, treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab led to numerically improved outcomes compared to 
placebo. The secondary virologic outcome of time-weighted average (TWA) change from baseline viral 
load also indicated numerically greater viral load reductions in the casirivimab+imdevimab treatment. 
Primary Virologic Efficacy Endpoint: Time-weighted average (TWA) daily change from 
baseline in viral load from Day 1 to Day 
•  Casirivimab+imdevimab treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in viral load from 
Day 1 to 7, compared to placebo, in participants who were seronegative at baseline (difference 
vs placebo of -0.28 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, -0.05], p=0.0172) 
•  Similar virologic efficacy was observed in the Overall mFAS (difference vs. placebo of -0.26 
log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.41, -0.12 copies/mL]). However, the treatment effect was greater 
in seronegative participants versus seropositive participants (difference vs. placebo of -0.21 
log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.41, -0.02 copies/mL]. Similarly, greater treatment effect was 
observed in participants with baseline viral load >106 copies/mL (difference vs. placebo of -
0.32 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, -0.13 copies/mL]) than in other subgroups based on 
varying baseline viral load thresholds (difference vs. placebo of -0.17 log10 copies/mL [95% CI 
-0.39, 0.05 copies/mL]). 
•  Consistent results were observed for both individual doses compared to placebo in 
seronegative participants, indicating the absence of a dose response effect (2400 mg: least 
squares [LS] mean -0.25 log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.51, 0.02]; 8000mg: LS mean -0.31 
log10 copies/mL [95% CI -0.57, -0.05]. 
Primary Clinical Efficacy Endpoint: Progression to death or mechanical ventilation 
Outcomes for Day 6 to Day 29 
•  Among participants treated with casirivimab+imdevimab, greater reductions in the proportion 
of participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation from Day 6 to Day 29 were 
observed in the Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 47.1%, 95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%), and in the overall 
mFAS (RRR: 24.2%, 95% CI: -10.9%, 48.2%). 
•  Negligible to moderate numerical differences were observed in seropositive participants (RRR: 
1.7%, 95% CI: -83.7%, 47.4%) and those with viral load ≤106 copies/mL (RRR: 21.5 %, 95 
% CI: -62.2%, 62.0%) 
•  When examined by individual doses there were reductions in the primary clinical endpoint for 
the 2400 mg dose group across all populations of interest (High Viral Load mFAS: RRR: RRR: 
45.2%, 95% CI 1.7%, 69.5%; Seronegative mFAS: RRR: 67.0%, 95% CI 28.2%, 84.8%; 
Overall mFAS: RRR: 48.9%, 95% CI 14.9%, 69.4%) and some smaller trends for benefit in the 
8000 mg dose group (High Viral Load mFAS: RRR: 6.2%, 95% CI -52.9%, 42.5%; 
Seronegative mFAS: RRR: 29.1%, 95% CI -25.9%, 60.0%; Overall mFAS: RRR: -0.7%, 95% 
CI (-52.5%, 33.4%). 
Outcomes for Day 1 to Day 29 
•  Among participants treated with casirivimab+imdevimab, greater reductions in the proportion 
of participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation were observed in the High Viral 
Load mFAS (RRR: 35.0%, 95% CI 6.6%, 54.8%), in the Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 47.0%, 
95% CI 17.7%, 65.8%), and in the Overall mFAS (RRR: 30.9%, 95% CI 5.4%, 49.5%) (Table 
16).  
Page 116/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
•  Numerical reductions were also observed in the Seropositive mFAS treated with 
casirivimab+imdevimab (RRR: 19.5%, 95% CI: -32.8%, 51.2%) and participants with viral 
load ≤106 copies/mL (RRR: 18.9 %, 95 % CI -49.6%, 56.0%).  
•  When examined by individual doses there were reductions in the primary clinical endpoint for 
the 2400 mg dose group across all populations of interest (High Viral Load mFAS: RRR: 47.0%, 
95% CI 15.0%, 66.9%; Seronegative mFAS: RRR: 58.0%, 95% CI  24.0%, 76.8%; Overall 
mFAS: RRR: 46.6%, 95% CI 19.6%, 64.5% and trends for benefit in the 8000 mg dose group 
(High Viral Load mFAS: RRR: 23.3%, 95% CI -15.8%, 49.2%; Seronegative mFAS: RRR: 
36.9%, 95% CI -3.7%, 61.6%; Overall mFAS: RRR: 14.9%, 95% CI -21.0%, 40.1%). 
Virologic Efficacy Endpoint: Time-weighted average change from baseline viral load in NP 
samples from Day 1 to Day 11 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, p-values were not controlled for type I error. 
Casirivimab+imdevimab treatment (combined and individual doses) led to a reduction in viral load 
through Day 11, compared to placebo in the Seronegative mFAS, the High Viral Load, and the Overall 
mFAS. 
Greater reductions in viral load through Day 29 were observed in casirivimab+imdevimab treated 
participants (combined and individual doses) compared to placebo in the TWA daily change from 
baseline.

All-cause mortality 
• 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab led to a numerical improvement in all-cause mortality 
from Day 1 through Day 29 in the casirivimab+imdevimab combined dose group compared to 
placebo in the Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 55.6%; 95% CI: 24.2%, 74.0%) (Table 19), Overall 
mFAS (RRR: 35.9%; 95% CI: 7.3%, 55.7%) (Table 20), and High Viral Load mFAS (RRR: 
36.1%; 95% CI: 2.3%, 58.2%) (Table 21). In participants who were seropositive at baseline, 
there were numerically fewer deaths through Day 29 in the combined doses group compared 
to the placebo group (RRR: 21.3%; 95% CI; -40.0%, 55.8%) (Table 22). 
•  Reductions in the proportion of participants who died from Day 6 to Day 29 for the 
• 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined doses group compared to the placebo group were observed 
in the Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 56.0%, 95% CI: 21.9%, 75.2%) (Table 19), the Overall 
mFAS (RRR: 34.5%, 95% CI: 3.2%, 55.6%) (Table 20), and the High Viral Load mFAS (RRR: 
34.2%, 95% CI: -3.4%, 58.2%) (Table 21). 
The individual doses (2400 mg and 8000 mg) compared to placebo for all-cause mortality are 
presented in Table 19 to 22 for the different analysis populations. Treatment benefit by 
individual doses shows the 2400 mg dose group had reductions in all-cause mortality across all 
populations of interest, compared to smaller but numerically fewer deaths with 8000 mg. 
Consistent with the results of the primary clinical efficacy endpoints, the absence of a dose-
related trend suggests there is no meaningful difference in efficacy between the doses and the 
variability observed between the two doses is due to the small sample size within each dose 
group. 
Page 121/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Mechanical ventilation 
There was a lower cumulative incidence of patients progressing to mechanical ventilation through Day 
29 in the casirivimab+imdevimab combined doses group compared to placebo in the Seronegative 
mFAS (7.0%, [95% CI: 4.8%, 10.3%] vs. 10.6% [95% CI: 6.6%, 16.8%]) (Table 19). In the overall 
mFAS, the cumulative incidence in the casirivimab+imdevimab combined doses group was 7.2% (95% 
CI: 5.6%, 9.2%) compared to 9.3% (95% CI: 6.7%, 12.7%) in the placebo group (Table 20). In the 
High Viral Load mFAS, the cumulative incidence in the combined doses group was 7.7% (95% CI: 
5.5%, 10.6%) compared to 11.8% (95% CI: 8.2%, 16.8%) in the placebo group (Table 21). 
Death or readmission 
For the composite endpoint of death or readmission at Day 29, reductions were observed among 
participants treated with casirivimab+imdevimab in the combined doses group versus placebo in the 
Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 49.9%; 95% CI: 26.0%, 66.0%) (event rate 12.2% [44/360] vs. 24.4% 
[39/160]) (Table 19). The RRR at Day 29 in the Overall mFAS was 24.9% (95% CI 0.3%, 43.4%) 
(Table 20) and 22.4% (95% CI: -7.4%, 43.9%) in the High Viral Load mFAS (Table 21). 
Discharge 
In the Seronegative mFAS, there were more participants discharged through Day 29 in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab combined doses group compared to the placebo group, with a RRR of -10.8% 
and 95% CI: -20.2%, -2.0%) (Table 19). The median time to discharge was 4.0 days across all 
treatment groups (individual and combined doses) compared to 4.5 days in the placebo group, 
however the upper quartile (75%) time to discharge was 8.0 days across all treatment groups 
compared to 17.0 days in the placebo group. 
Similarly, in the Overall mFAS and in the High Viral Load mFAS, treatment with 
casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in more participants discharged through Day 29 and the RRR was -
5.8% with 95% CI: -11.1%, -0.6%, and RRR of -9.5% with 95% CI: -17.7%, -1.9%, respectively 
(Table 20, Table 21). 
Exploratory Analysis of Virologic and Clinical Efficacy Outcomes in Cohort 2 
Due to the IDMC-recommended enrolment pause for cohorts 2 and 3 during phase 2 these cohorts 
were not fully enrolled, and the sample size is very small. As a result, only limited efficacy data are 
available. All participants enrolled in cohorts 2 and 3 continued in the study and were followed up 
through the end of study visit on study day 57. 
As cohort 3 included only 33 participants in the Overall mFAS, efficacy data were largely 
uninterpretable. Accordingly, analyses are presented below for cohort 2 only: viral load through day 11 
(Figure 23), all-cause mortality through day 29 (Figure 24), and death or mechanical ventilation 
through day 29 (Figure 25). 
Page 122/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
No meaningful trends for efficacy were observed for any endpoint due to limited sample size in the 
overall population of either cohort 2 (148 participants total in the Overall mFAS) or cohort 3 (33 
participants total in the Overall mFAS). In addition, an imbalance in more participants having do not 
resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) or comfort care status in casirivimab+imdevimab groups, 
compared to placebo groups, may have confounded these results. 
2.4.3.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
RECOVERY is an investigator-initiated, individually randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial in 
which several treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The 
multicenter study was conducted in the UK, Indonesia, and Nepal, with 127 hospitals in the UK taking 
part in the evaluation of casirivimab+imdevimab. The protocol was designed to provide reliable 
assessments of the effects of multiple different treatments (including re-purposed and novel drugs) on 
major outcomes in COVID-19 and allowed for treatment arms to be added or removed according to the 
Page 123/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
emerging evidence. A factorial randomization was utilised to compare the selected treatments with 
usual care. 
To facilitate collaboration, even in hospitals that suddenly become overloaded, patient enrolment (via 
the internet) and all other trial procedures are greatly streamlined. Informed consent is simple and 
data entry is minimal. 
The inclusion / exclusion criteria are inclusive, no limitation regarding the time of symptom onset a 
clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection disqualifies the patient for enrolment. This is in contrast to 
the more restrictive inclusion criteria of Study COV-2066, which aims to enrol patients with early 
disease. Hospitalised patients with clinically suspected or PCR laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection associated disease and no medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, 
put the patient at significant risk if he/she were to participate in the trial were enrolled. 
The study treatment was a single 8000 mg dose (casirivimab 4000 mg and imdevimab 4000 mg) on 
top of usual care. Patients could also receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of 
care in an adaptive factorial design, this approach raises some difficulties in interpretation of the 
outcomes. 
There was no pre-specified sample size, and this raises uncertainty. Instead, the DMC repeatedly 
assessed the primary endpoint and was planned to recommend stopping enrolment if a mortality 
reduction of at least a 3 to 3·5 standard error was observed in all randomised patients. The study was 
conducted with relevant uncertainty, and this is understood in the pandemic. The RECOVERY team 
clarified that no DMC members (who were the only individuals who can review interim unblinded 
analyses) were involved in the primary endpoint change and Trial Steering Committee meeting 
minutes, at which the updated SAP was ratified. 
Of note, the power considerations are not fully in line with the DMC criterion to consider recommending 
stopping a treatment early for benefit would require at least a 3 to 3·5 standard error reduction in 
mortality (see statistical methods). Assuming asymptotic normality of the test statistic, the DMC 
criterion would correspond to a stricter level than p=0.01, and this observation is consistent with the 
fact that the DMC did not recommend stopping enrolment. 
It should also be noted that at the time when the decision was made to stop enrolment, the trial 
steering committee considered a benefit in the overall population (i.e., irrespective of serostatus) 
unlikely to be demonstrated. In conclusion, there is uncertainty due to a lack of pre-specification of the 
sample size. The initially specified DMC criteria for stopping enrolment were not adhered to. 
Since this is an open-label study, the participants and local study staff were not masked to the 
allocated treatment. This is not optimal, but the primary outcome of 28-day mortality may be 
considered sufficiently objective to outweigh concerns on lack of blinding. The DMC, which was 
unblinded, regularly assessed the trial data. 
No estimand has been defined. However, it seems clear that the primary analysis of 28-day mortality 
targets a treatment policy estimand in a seronegative population. Although a treatment policy 
estimand is of primary interest, restriction to seronegatives does not reflect the intended indication, 
which is irrespective of serostatus. 
Secondary estimands are more complex. In particular it is not obvious how an estimand targeted by 
the analysis of time to discharge should be described. Particularly difficult is the fact that deceased 
patients were planned to be censored after day 28, thus assuming that these patients would still be 
hospitalized at the end of the observation period (see below). Provided an effect on 28-day mortality, 
this is however not considered critical. 
The analysis set, consisting of all subjects randomized, is in principle endorsed, as it adheres to the 
intent-to-treat principle. However, restriction to seronegative subjects warrants further discussion. 
The primary analysis of this open-label study was initially planned to be conducted in all randomized 
subjects but was restricted to seronegatives in a very late amendment to the SAP (version 3.0) which 
Page 124/173 
 
  
 
 
 
was finalised on 21 May 2021, i.e., one day prior to closure of enrolment (on 22 May 2021) and 
several weeks after the decision to stop enrolment was made by the trial steering committee on 27 
April 2021. At the time of this decision, the DMC had conducted several interim analyses and results 
from previous comparisons in this study were already known. Some of these comparisons included 
subjects who were also included in the REGN-COV-2 vs control comparison due to the factorial design. 
It is acknowledged that external data (results from study 2067, not part of this assessment) suggested 
that seronegatives may have greater benefit, but uncertainty remains on a potentially opportunistic 
change of primary analysis population. 
The SAP states that “Earlier versions of the statistical analysis plan recognised the importance of the 
seronegative subgroup”, however this statement cannot be verified, as only the latest version of the 
SAP is submitted. The applicant was asked to provide previous versions that were provided. 
It is endorsed that the protocol stated that for any pairwise comparison, only concurrent controls 
would be analysed. 
The primary outcome of 28-day mortality was planned to be analysed by means of a log-rank test. It is 
not fully understood why a time-to-event analysis should be preferred over an analysis of proportions 
for this rather short-term outcome. Time to death within 28 days does not seem more relevant than 
the dichotomous version of death until day 28. However, the results are interpretable, and analyses of 
the binary outcome provide similarly positive results. 
The analyses were not adjusted for baseline covariates. 
According to the study protocol, patients who were discharged alive from hospital were planned to be 
assumed as being alive. It was assumed that this means that patients were censored after 28 days 
after randomisation. The applicant was asked to confirm. In addition, information on the amount of 
missing values in relevant variables and discuss the robustness of results in the presence of missing 
data were also requested. The applicant confirmed the mechanisms by which discharged subjects were 
classified as events or censored and provided further reassurance that there was only very little 
missing data. This is acknowledged. In the control group as compared to the ronapreve group a 
slightly higher portion of those patients who were discharged alive died after being discharged. Any 
interpretation of this finding is limited by the fact that discharge alive is an intercurrent event and 
depends on survival until discharge. 
Statements on the significance level are somewhat inconsistent. Apparently, no significance level was 
pre-specified in the study protocol, the SAP states a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and the 
decision to stop enrolment was based on power considerations at the two-sided level of 0.01. The DMC 
criterion to recommend stopping enrolment (mortality difference of about 3 to 3.5 standard errors) 
may correspond to yet another level of significance. An ad-hoc interpretation of p-values and estimates 
may be warranted, and it should be noted that there is relevant uncertainty about type-I-error control. 
There were several interim analyses for efficacy through the DMC. The applicant was asked to provide 
information on the number and timing (in terms of information fraction) of those interim looks and 
discuss potential bias in estimation due to multiple interim looks, by providing bias adjusted point 
estimates and multiplicity adjusted confidence intervals. The applicant confirmed that there were 12 
interim analyses for efficacy. This number is considered high, especially in an open-label study. The 
applicant’s responses suggest that the sponsor remained blinded towards interim results. Post-hoc 
considerations on multiplicity were provided. Any such post-hoc discussion is limited as it is may not 
be unequivocal. The total information was not prespecified and in consequence any information 
fraction relative to the finally observed information could only be calculated post-hoc. Despite 
limitations, the applicant’s responses provided some reassurance, that the criterion for the DMC to 
recommend stopping for efficacy was chosen in a way that the increase in type-I-error probability may 
not be substantial. CHMP concluded that type-I-error was not controlled, and uncertainty remained. 
The extent of type-I-error inflation was considered limited and needed to be balanced against the 
observed benefits. 
Page 125/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The complex study design added uncertainty. Previous results from this open-label platform study 
(e.g., through analyses of other treatments, or interim analyses of REGN-COV-2) may have influenced 
the design of the ongoing study (e.g., through changes in patient selection). It was acknowledged that 
the study was conducted in a situation with high uncertainty in a quickly changing environment. CHMP 
concluded that some uncertainties remained due to the complexity of the study design, but results 
were interpretable. 
Multiplicity control across primary and secondary hypotheses was only specified in the SAP, and this is 
not ideal. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A flow chart of participants of the RECOVERY trial is provided. However, the data are not 
comprehensible e.g., 4839 patients were randomised in the REGN-COV group, 28 withdrew consent 
but 4839 patients were included in the 28 day ITT. The applicant was requested to provide data on the 
numbers randomised and numbers actually treated (including specifying how many patients were 
randomised but not treated.  The MAH confirmed that all 4839 participants randomized to the 
casirivimab+imdevimab arm and all 4946 participants randomized to the usual care alone arm were 
included in the 28-day intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, including those who withdrew consent. 
The MAH provided further information on the patient flow. Apparently not all randomised patients 
provided a completed-follow up form, this loss of follow-up is understandable.  
The applicant confirmed that approximately 10% of the patients in the ronapreve arm did not receive 
allocated treatment. While this is not of concern with regard to the validity of the treatment effect 
estimate (under the alternative it would reduce the estimated effect, under the null it would not 
matter), the high proportion of approximately 10% was not understood. Reasons were not recorded. 
In the 28-day intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, patients who withdrew consent were included. The MAH 
was invited to comment on this issue. A total of 28/4839 (0.6%) patients in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 18/4946 (0.4%) patients in the Usual Care alone arm withdrew 
consent within 28-days after randomisation. Thus, the numbers of patients who withdrew consent is 
low. The majority i.e., more than half of the patients in each arm withdrew on or before Day 2 (23 of 
28 patients in the casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 10 of 18 patients in the Usual Care alone arm). 
In the 28-day intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, patients who withdrew consent were included. The MAH 
clarified that inclusion of patients who withdrew consent is in line with the study protocol, which states, 
“In accordance with regulatory guidance, de-identified data that have already been collected and 
incorporated in the study database will continue to be used (and any identifiable data will be 
destroyed).” This approach is accepted. 
A portion of participants was included in other study parts (e.g., aspirin vs no additional treatment or 
baricitinib vs. no additional treatment). The MAH was asked to discuss whether this may have had any 
impact on results of the comparison of REGN-COV-2 vs no additional treatment, e.g., through 
respective analyses of treatment combinations in the factorial design in particular for those treatments 
for which results were already available. The MAH provided information on allocation to other 
treatments, including an exploratory analysis of potential drug-drug-interactions. There were no 
apparent baseline imbalances with regard to allocation to other treatments, and that is expected, as all 
treatments were randomly allocated. 
The applicant concluded that there are no meaningful interactions, as interaction p-values are all 
>0.11 however that was not agreed. Interaction tests are known to have poor statistical properties, 
and the p-value does not convey information on the clinical relevance of potential differences. The size 
of estimated interactions was assessed: The reported interaction HRs for Baricitinib and Colchicine are 
in the range of interactions that may hypothetically neutralize the effect of ronapreve in seronegatives 
(e.g. the interaction HR for Baricitinib is 1.3 and multiplication with the ronapreve RR=0.79 in 
Page 126/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
seronegatives results in in neutral effect 0.79*1.30=1.027). Acknowledging that confidence intervals 
may be wide, the MAH was asked to provide estimates of the effect of ronapreve in subgroups defined 
by allocation to Baricitinib or Colchicine in the ITT population as well as in the seronegative subgroup 
and to discuss the plausibility and relevance of observed differences. The MAH provided estimates for 
the effect of ronapreve in those patients allocated or not allocated to baricitinib or colchicine. It was 
agreed that a potential interaction with colchicine is of minor importance, given that colchicine is 
currently considered ineffective as treatment of COVID-19. 
However, results suggest a potentially detrimental effect of ronapreve on top of baricitinib in patients 
not seronegative. Among those allocated to baricitinib, the estimated hazard ratios for ronapreve are 
0.89 and 1.20 in the seronegative and overall population respectively. This implies that the estimate in 
patients not seronegative must be well beyond HR=1.2 (result not provided by the MAH). Credibility of 
these subgroup findings may be limited. Acknowledging that these findings are post-hoc and any 
interpretation should be made with great care, they add further uncertainty to the treatment of 
seropositive patients. They do not raise any concerns in seronegatives. Thus, these findings currently 
have no implications, but provide support to the finally agreed indication. 
A higher portion of subjects in the control arm proceeded to second randomisation. The MAH was 
asked to discuss whether this observation may support the treatment effect or whether it may imply 
that in addition to receiving or not receiving REGN-COV-2 there were other differences in patient care 
between the treatment groups in this open-label study. Also, to provide summary data on the time 
from first randomisation to second randomisation in these subjects and discuss clinical progression that 
lead to eligibility for second randomisation. With the data provided, it cannot be excluded that 
knowledge of the allocated treatment lead to very early inclusion in the tocilizumab part in the control 
group. The median time to second randomization was 0.4 hours, suggesting that patients were 
included in the tocilizumab part of the study very shortly after randomization to ronapreve or usual 
care and thus progression to the tocilizumab part does likely not reflect any effect of treatment in most 
patients. Knowledge of the allocated treatment in this open-label study appears to be the most 
plausible explanation for the higher portion of control subjects included in the tocilizumab part. Other 
treatments appear rather balanced, but this does not fully resolve the uncertainties about potentially 
different care in the arms of this open-label study. However, there is currently no reason to believe 
that this might have artificially inflated the treatment effect estimate. 
The study was performed in a single country, this might have contributed to some observed 
differences between the outcome of RECOVERY and COV-2066 (see below). 
There were 15 amendments to the protocol, in general addressing the opening and deletion of 
treatment arms. The factorial design allows testing of different combination of medicines in a short 
time frame.   
The participants’ demographic characteristics including age, sex, and race/ethnicity were generally 
balanced between the treatment groups for the seronegative group and among all randomized 
participants. The baseline disease characteristics of the seronegative participants were well-balanced 
between the treatment arms and were mostly similar to those reported for all randomized participants.  
1360 (14%) of the study participants had missing SARS-CoV-2 antibody test result. This number is 
considered relevant. With regard to oxygen report, the majority of patients (60-70 %) were in the 
combined groups of no oxygen and simple oxygen support, and less than 30% of patients received 
non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. The type of oxygen support was balanced between 
the groups. 
Quite a substantial proportion of the participants have an unknown serostatus. The MAH was asked to 
comment under the light of outcome, in particular in light of an observed slightly higher mortality in 
seropositive participants (16% vs 15%). The MAH provided further analyses to support their view that 
results in seronegative patients are robust despite the high proportion of patients with unknown 
serostatus. Despite the fact that there were more patients with unknown serostatus in the control 
group (12% vs 16% in ronapreve vs usual care, p<0.001), there were no apparent strong baseline 
imbalances between the treatment groups in each of the serostatus subgroups. The effect estimate in 
Page 127/173 
 
  
 
 
 
patients with unknown serostatus suggests very little to no effect on all-cause mortality. A pooled 
analysis was provided by the sponsor based on patients with unknown or negative serostatus, 
suggesting that the conclusion of a benefit in seronegatives would not have been altered even if all 
patients with unknown serostatus were truly seronegative. This was further supported by tipping-point 
analyses. Overall, the treatment effect estimate in seronegative subjects appears to be robust against 
potential biases due to undetected serostatus in the group with missing serostatus. 
The two primary endpoints were 28 days all-cause mortality in patients seronegative at randomisation 
and in all patients randomised (tested hierarchically). 
9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, 
including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) 
patients with unknown baseline antibody status. 
Among participants who were seronegative at baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction of 
20% in 28-day all-cause mortality among participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared 
to participants receiving usual care alone. 24 % (396/1633 participants) died in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group vs. 30% (451/1520 participants) in the usual care group (rate ratio: 
0.80; 95% CI: 0.70–0·91; p=0.001). 
Among all randomized participants (including those who were seronegative, seropositive and 
serostatus unknown), there was no significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality between the two 
groups. 20% (944/4839 participants) of participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 
21% (1026/4946 participants) of participants in the usual care alone group (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI: 
0.86 to 1.03; p=0.17). 28-day mortality was also assessed in participants who were seropositive at 
baseline. There was little difference in the 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups: 16% 
(411/2636) of participants in the seropositive casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 15% 
(383/2636) of participants in the usual care alone group (rate ratio 1.09; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.26). The 
proportional effect of casirivimab+imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between participants 
who were seronegative and seropositive at baseline (test for heterogeneity, p=0.001). These findings 
are in line the hypothesis that patients who had not yet an immune response benefit most from an 
anti-viral in contrast to patients who already developed an immune response.  
Subgroup analyses suggest that both positive serostatus as already explained as well as time from 
symptom onset >7days might be associated with lack of efficacy. It is observed that seronegatives 
differed from the overall study population with regard to the time from symptom onset. The applicant 
was asked to discuss whether one subgroup interaction could mask the other. The MAH was asked to 
provide respective interaction analyses and investigate different cut-offs for time from symptom onset.  
Extensive exploratory analyses were provided. Overall, it was noted that time from symptom onset 
does not provide a clear signal for an interaction with treatment when using two cut-off values (7 and 
14 days). No plausible mechanistic reason was found to assume that any interaction between 
treatment and time from symptom onset would not be monotonous. Thus, it was agreed that it is 
unlikely that one interaction may mask another in this setting. This is further supported by 2-way and 
3-way interaction analyses provided by the MAH. 
Minor inconsistencies were observed in reported results of the RECOVERY trial, e.g. between the 
clinical overview and the material by the RECOVERY investigators. For example, the proportion of 
patients who died in the regn-cov-2 group in the overall population is presented as either 19% or 20% 
across different tables and figures, the confidence interval for the effect on discharge alive is presented 
as either 1.08-1.30 or 1.09-1.31 across different figures and tables. Although these numerical 
inconsistencies may be minor with regard to the overall interpretation of results, they do raise 
uncertainty. The MAH was asked to clarify inconsistencies between the documents provided by the 
applicant and those authored by the RECOVERY investigators and provide an outcome table with 
correct values. The applicant clarified that there were inconsistencies in previously submitted data 
because analyses were preliminary. Although it is not understood why two different (and inconsistent) 
Page 128/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
levels of information were included in the previously submitted dossier, this concern was considered 
resolved as per the reason above. 
Secondary outcomes  
Secondary endpoints are descriptive, as the second primary endpoint (28-day mortality in the overall 
population) was not met, and hierarchical testing is discontinued accordingly. P-values <0.05 are 
considered nominally significant (i.e., in an exploratory sense). 
In seronegative patients, the mean duration of hospital stay was shorter in the REGN-COV group than 
in the SOC group, while in all randomised patients no treatment effect on the hospital stay was 
observed.  
Among seronegative participants, discharge alive within 28 days was nominally significant among 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared with the usual care group (64% vs. 58%; 
risk ratio: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.30).  
Among all randomized participants, there was no meaningful difference observed in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group compared with the usual care group in discharge alive within 28 days.  
Use of invasive mechanical ventilation or death among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation 
at randomisation was reported. The reported death numbers were not in line with the mortality data 
reported for the primary endpoint e.g., in seronegative patients 396 death were reported for “28 days 
mortality” while 383 deaths were reported under “use of invasive mechanical ventilation or death 
among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation”. The same applies for the 
usual care group and all randomised data.  The apparent discrepancies in the reported number of 
deaths for the primary outcome of 28-day mortality and the secondary outcome of ‘use of invasive 
mechanical ventilation or death among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at 
randomization’ is clarified to be due to deaths among participants on invasive mechanical ventilation at 
randomization. 
The final conclusion on the importance of the finding is hampered by the small sample size in the 
RECOVERY study. Of note in Study 2066 Cohort II and III (more diseased patients e.g., on invasive 
ventilation) were closed early due to futility, and this does not lend support. Nonetheless, the 
explanation is accepted. 
For seronegative participants as well for all patients, the 28-day all-cause mortality in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group across pre-specified subgroups (age, sex, ethnicity, days since 
symptom onset, respiratory support received and use of corticosteroids) was provided. Importantly, 
regarding the use of corticosteroids both groups i.e., patients receiving corticosteroids and patients 
receiving no corticosteroids show treatment benefit which was even more pronounced. 
Of note, patients > 80 years of seems not to benefit from REGN-COV therapy (reduction in 28-day all-
cause mortality and discharge alive from hospital). The MAH was asked to provide a sensitivity analysis 
and the data of the same age group of study COV-2066. In this regard, the data of the RECOVERY 
study and Study 2066 are conflicting. Study COV-2066 suggests a potential benefit in patients≥ 80 
years in both endpoints i.e., mortality and discharge alive, based on positive point estimates. 
RECOVERY suggests no benefit in those patients. It should be noted that Study COV-2066 is only 
supportive and more emphasis is put on RECOVERY in the overall assessment. Sample sizes in 
RECOVERY are larger also in the subgroup of elderly patients, Study COV-2066 contributes 165 
seronegative patients above 80 years of age in total, i.e., pooled over cohorts and study phases. 
RECOVERY contributes 464 patients above 80 years of age and suggest no effect. It is agreed with the 
MAH, that a benefit in elderly cannot be excluded based on these data. However, a benefit can also not 
be concluded and there remains uncertainty. 
Given the lack of a mechanistic explanation and some support from COV-2066, it is not seen grounds 
to restrict the indication, but consider that the prescriber should be informed of the uncertainty. 
Page 129/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The MAH was requested to propose an adequate wording for the SmPC section “special population”.  
For the selected endpoints i.e., 28 days mortality, discharge alive from hospital and invasive 
mechanical ventilation or death the outcome for seropositive patients / all patients at baseline not only 
seems less favourable but harmful in the treatment group.  
The signal of reduced efficacy in the seropositive patients observed in RECOVERY study remained after 
clarification. Considering that the benefit-risk-balance is negative in the overall study population, CHMP 
considered that an extrapolation to a broader indication was not justified. The MAH was asked to 
propose a new indication wording that restricts to those patients for whom a benefit can be concluded 
without speculation i.e., seronegative patients. Further in the overall population requiring supplemental 
oxygen in RECOVERY, there was a reduction in 28-day mortality only in seronegative patients. This 
conclusion is supported by descriptive results from study COV-2066. The RECOVERY and COV-2066 
study results demonstrated clinical benefit of casirivimab+imdevimab in hospitalised patients with 
COVID-19 who were negative on serology testing.  
In addition, it is important to note that with regard to immunocompromised patients: 
•  Consistent with their underlying immunocompromised state, the immunocompromised patients 
• 
were more likely to be seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (68.7% vs 41.2%, 
respectively) and to have a higher median viral load (7.21 vs 6.32 log10 copies/mL, 
respectively) at baseline compared with all study participants. 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab led to a greater reduction in viral load from baseline, 
with a least-squares mean time weighted average change in viral load difference versus 
placebo at Day 7 for immunocompromised patients of -0.69 (95% CI: -1.25, -0.14) vs. -0.31 
(CI: -0.42, -0.20) for all study patients; treatment benefit persisted through Day 29. 
•  Although the sample size was small for the immunocompromised patient subset (n=99 [68 
seronegative, 25 seropositive, 6 unknown]), trends in clinical outcomes of death or mechanical 
ventilation at Day 29 (7/64 patients [cumulative incidence 11.0%] casirivimab+imdevimab vs. 
6/35 patients [cumulative incidence 17.2%] placebo) were consistent with those in all study 
patients (200/1307 [cumulative incidence 15.7%] casirivimab+imdevimab vs. 113/633 
[cumulative incidence 18.3%] placebo). 
The COV-2066 data show the value of treating severely immunocompromised patients with 
casirivimab+imdevimab and the additional benefits that can be realised in the highest risk patients. 
With the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and/or waning immune protection, 
immunocompromised patients will continue to be at a higher risk of severe outcomes compared to 
those who are immunocompetent. 
For further clarity regarding the RECOVERY data, in addition to the existing results for seronegative 
patients, the MAH adapted the indication and added summaries of the results for all randomised 
patients and seropositive patients in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Thus, 4.1 is updated with the following indication: 
Treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 
40 kg and receiving supplemental oxygen, who have a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test 
result. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
COV-2066 was an adaptive Phase 1/2/3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to 
exclude futility (Phase 1/2) and evaluate efficacy and safety (Phase 3) of casirivimab+imdevimab in 
hospitalised adult and adolescent patients with COVID-19. The study was the first-in-human clinical 
trial for the combination mAb therapy product (casirivimab and imdevimab). 
On 09 Apr 2021, owing to low recruitment rates, the Sponsor made a decision to close enrolment into 
the study. The reason for early termination was not based on safety concerns, but due to low 
recruitment rates over the preceding 3 months. All participants were followed through to their end of 
Page 130/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
study visit according to the protocol, and the last participant last visit date for the main study was 04 
Jun 2021. 
A subset of cohort 1 and cohort 1A participants at select study sites in the US are enrolled in an 
ongoing long COVID sub-study. Results from this sub-study will be reported at a later time. 
The final CSR is based on a database lock date of 08 Jul 2021. This represents the final data for the 
main study. 
The target population are hospitalised patients early in the course of the disease e.g. onset of 
symptoms ≤10 days before randomization and hospitalized for ≤72 hours. Patients receiving ECMO, 
initiated on renal replacement therapy due to COVID-19 or had circulatory shock requiring 
vasopressors at randomization are excluded from the study. In general, the inclusion / exclusion 
criteria are stricter than for RECOVERY, this might lead to difficulties in comparing the outcome of the 
two studies. 
Patients entering the trial had varying degrees of oxygen support at randomization and this 
determined their categorization into 1 of 4 cohorts for analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients who required no supplemental oxygen support (Cohort 1A). 
Patients who had O2 saturation >93% on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, simple face 
mask, or another similar device (Cohort 1). 
Patients who required high-intensity oxygen supplementation (Cohort 2). High-intensity 
oxygen therapy was defined as the use of non-rebreather mask with an oxygen flow rate of at 
least 10 L/min; use of a high flow device with at least 50% FiO2, or use of non-invasive 
ventilation to treat hypoxemia. 
Patients who were mechanically ventilated (Cohort 3). 
Patients were randomised in each cohort in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a one-time infusion of 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg, casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg, or placebo, all given in 
addition to the local standard of care. Patients may receive the standard-of-care for the 
treatment of COVID-19 per local guidelines. Background treatments may include antiviral 
therapies (remdesivir or other), immune-based therapies (tocilizumab, sarilumab, steroids, or 
other) or antiviral and immune-based therapies 
In general, the methods are acceptable. In particular, a 1:1:1 ratio is supported, and the number of 
stratification variables seems feasible. However, there are some unclarities.   
However, there are some unclarities, e.g., whether permuted block randomisation or another method 
was used. However, this is considered of minor importance in light of the early termination and study 
results.  
For the efficacy analyses, since the overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to early study 
termination, study cohorts (Phase 3 Cohort 1 and Phase 2 Cohort 1A) and casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose groups (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) were pooled for the primary efficacy analysis. 
The primary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical order. 
Page 131/173 
 
  
 
 
 
The study was prematurely terminated before the planned sample size was reached. Thus, the sample 
size calculations are of limited relevance. The sample size for phase 2 cohort 1A has no statistical 
justification, indicating the exploratory character of cohort 1A. Sample size calculations for prior 
phases of the adaptive study are not discussed in detail. These exploratory phases of the adaptive 
study were planned to be used as a basis for planning the phase 3 part of the study. 
The statistical methods were described and are overall acceptable, but the premature termination and 
respective ad-hoc modification of the analysis plan may not fully support a confirmatory interpretation. 
The study was prematurely terminated and only after the decision to terminate the study, the protocol 
specified that the exploratory phase 2 cohort 1A and the confirmatory phase 3 cohort 1 would be 
pooled. This is not fully in line with the concept of a confirmatory study, where the hypotheses should 
be specified before the study is conducted. Premature termination does not provide reassurance that 
the sponsor was confident in the hypothesis investigated in the study. 
In light of this and in light of the study results (primary clinical endpoint not met), a careful and rather 
exploratory interpretation is warranted. 
Further comments: 
Virology 
The methods for the virologic endpoint are overall acceptable. 
It is endorsed that an estimand was defined for the virological endpoint, and this estimand is overall 
supported. 
Clinic 
It is somewhat unexpected that no estimand was defined for the clinical endpoint. The definition may 
not be straightforward, e.g., in light of the fact that events occurring before day 6 were to be excluded 
from the analysis. This adds uncertainty to the interpretation of the primary clinical endpoint. However, 
given that the endpoint was not met, the assessors do not see any value in a post-hoc discussion on 
this matter. 
The primary analysis set was defined as the High Viral Load mFAS, presumably because a larger effect 
might have been expected in those patients. It might be questioned whether this analysis set transfers 
to clinical practise, as it requires a PCR test before treatment initiation. 
The primary outcome variable, death or mechanical ventilation from day 6 to day 29, may be prone to 
biases such as immortal time bias. It is not clear whether subjects who experienced an event prior to 
Page 132/173 
 
  
 
 
 
  
day 6 were planned to be excluded or counted as not having an event. Analyses including events prior 
to day 6 are considered more robust but were included only later in hierarchy. 
The analysis model was specified as a Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for background 
therapy, with a fisher exact test being the fallback option in case of small event numbers. While a 
fallback option may in principle be acceptable, the strategy seems to reflect uncertain expectations and 
in particular the expectation that there may be sparse events (which would not be the optimal basis for 
assessment of benefit-risk). 
The primary analysis was not planned to be adjusted or stratified for country, although this was a 
stratification factor. 
A hierarchical approach to multiplicity control is acceptable. The order of hypotheses might not be 
ideal, e.g., given concerns on potential biases due to exclusion of early events and a lack of clarity how 
the respective analyses were planned. 
Pooling of cohorts somewhat contradicts the fact that initially the cohorts were planned as separate. It 
is not obvious whether any heterogeneity was expected. However, results from RECOVERY do not 
suggest any strong heterogeneity across cohorts of oxygen supply. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The majority of the patients were enrolled in the United States (87.6%) and the remaining participants 
were enrolled in Europe (~5% Romania and Moldova), Mexico (~5%) and South America (~4%, Brazil 
and Chile). 
In general, the demographic characteristics are well balanced between the treatment arms. 
The mFAS was used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints, based on the principle that an anti-viral 
agent would only be anticipated to provide efficacy in patients with measurable virus at baseline. The 
Seronegative mFAS and the High Viral Load mFAS were used for the primary analysis and descriptive 
analysis of certain virologic endpoints and clinical endpoints. Additional analyses were performed in the 
Seropositive mFAS, as needed. For the purpose of research this approach is acceptable, and the 
reason provided for the approach by the MAH could be followed. However, in clinical practice this 
diffrenecation would not be a realistic option.   
A pre-specified statistical hierarchy was used to test the virologic and clinical efficacy of 
casirivimab+imdevimab in the combined doses group (2400 mg IV and 8000 mg IV) compared to 
placebo group, in pooled Cohort 1 (Phase 3) and Cohort 1A (Phase 2). The combined analysis of the 
dose groups is accepted for reporting the overall results. Of note, an analysis of the individual dose 
groups separately can be found under “dose finding studies”. 
The results indicated that the first primary endpoint (viral load reduction during the first week after 
treatment, in the Seronegative mFAS) was met (difference vs placebo of -0.28 log10 copies/mL, 
p=0.0172). But statistical testing terminated at the first clinical endpoint (reduction in death or 
mechanical ventilation from Day 6 to Day 29, in the High Viral Load mFAS) as it did not show a 
statistically significant treatment effect (RRR: 25.5%, p=0.2048). 
When the observation period covered the whole efficacy period (Day 1 to Day 29), numeric reductions 
were observed in the proportion of participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation and all-
cause mortality in all populations of interest (High Viral Load mFAS, Seronegative mFAS and Overall 
mFAS).  
For the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints of mechanical ventilation, death or readmission and 
discharge, treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab led to numerically improved outcomes compared to 
placebo. The secondary virologic outcome of time-weighted average (TWA) change from baseline viral 
load also indicated numerically greater viral load reductions in the casirivimab+imdevimab treatment. 
Page 133/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Study COV-2066 is considered as supportive study. As expected for an anti-viral REGN-COV treatment 
led to viral load reduction in the first week after treatment. The most prominent effect was seen in 
seronegative patients with baseline high viral load. However, the study failed to demonstrate that the 
anti-viral effect translates in a statically significant clinical benefit i.e., progression to death or 
mechanical ventilation for Day 6 to Day 29 or Day 1 to Day 29. The results indicate a trend towards a 
benefit of REGN-COV treatment: 
Outcomes for Day 6 to Day 29 showed in the treatment group greater reductions in the proportion of 
participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation from Day 6 to Day 29 (Seronegative mFAS 
(RRR: 47.1%, 95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%), and in the overall mFAS (RRR: 24.2%, 95% CI: -10.9%, 
48.2%). Negligible to moderate numerical differences were observed in seropositive participants (RRR: 
1.7%, 95% CI: -83.7%, 47.4%) and those with viral load ≤106 copies/mL (RRR: 21.5 %, 95 % CI: -
62.2%, 62.0%) 
Outcomes for Day 1 to Day 29 showed among participants treated with REGN-COV greater reductions 
in the proportion of participants who died or went on mechanical ventilation High Viral Load mFAS 
(RRR: 35.0%, 95% CI 6.6%, 54.8%), Seronegative mFAS (RRR: 47.0%, 95% CI 17.7%, 65.8%), and 
in the Overall mFAS (RRR: 30.9%, 95% CI 5.4%, 49.5%).   
Secondary endpoints 
Treatment with REGN-COV led to nominally significant improvement in mortality from day 1 through 
day 29 in the Seronegative mFAS, High Viral Load mFAS, and Overall mFAS. The greatest reduction in 
relative risk of death based on the proportion of participants who died occurred in participants who 
were seronegative at baseline with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 55.6% (nominal p=0.0032). 
Reduction in the proportion of participants who died from day 6 to day 29 for the combined doses 
group compared to the placebo group was nominally significant in the seronegative participants (RRR 
of 56.0%, nominal p=0.0051) and overall population (RRR of 34.5%, nominal p=0.0322), but the 
trends were not large enough in the high viral load population to reach nominal significance in this 
study (RRR of 34.2%, nominal p=0.0766) 
Potential clinical benefit of treatment with REGN-COV was observed across other secondary clinical 
endpoints (mechanical ventilation, death or readmission, and discharge) for all populations of interest: 
Seronegative mFAS, High Viral Load mFAS, and Overall mFAS 
Taken together the above, the efficacy results of study COC-2066 are uncertain but point in the same 
direction as the results observed in RECOVERY. 
Additional analysis  
The demonstration of the clinical and virologic efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab for the treatment of 
hospitalised participants with COVID-19 consists of data from two studies: the pivotal RECOVERY trial 
and the supportive COV-2066 study. An integrated analysis of efficacy was not performed across these 
studies. The MAH laid down that due to the differences in study design e.g., patient population and 
endpoints an integrated analysis of efficacy was not performed. The reasons provide by the MAH are 
understandable. 
It is accepted that it was aimed to open the access to RECOVERY to participants across the full range 
of COVID-19 disease severity in the hospitalized population, regardless of the type of respiratory 
support required while patients in COV-2066 primarily enrolled participants towards the lower end of 
disease severity that required no supplemental oxygen or low-flow supplemental oxygen. However, in 
practice the vast majority of participants in RECOVERY were also less diseased patients. i.e., > 70 % 
of the patients received no oxygen or simple oxygen (see Table 1 Baseline characteristics 
(seronegative and all participants) by treatment allocation) and thus the participants may be 
comparable in this respect (see baseline disease characteristics).  
Page 134/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
However, COV-2066 also had exclusion criteria to prevent the enrolment of participants with more 
severe disease that may have impacted the interpretation of efficacy and safety data. For example, 
those requiring additional forms of organ support, such as ECMO, inotropes and vasopressors, or renal 
replacement therapy were excluded from the study. In RECOVERY, there were no such exclusion 
criteria for those requiring additional forms of organ support. In order to explain the observed outcome 
comparing the results (see below) the MAH was requested to perform additional analysis for the 
RECOVERY study excluding the patients requiring additional forms of organ support, such as ECMO, 
inotropes and vasopressors, or renal replacement. 
The number of patients on ECMO were extremely low i.e. 17 patients, it is remarkable that only 1 
patient was seronegative while 9 patients were seropositive (and 7 with unknown serostatus), thus no 
meaningful data can be provided in this patient group. The MAH provided arguments that given the 
mode of action no interaction with ECMO would be expected, this argumentation can be followed. 
However, the concern was that later in the course of disease pathophysiology reflects the host immune 
response to the virus than damage due to the virus itself, as seropositive patients don’t seem to 
benefit from treatment. However, it is acknowledged that some patients might still be not able to show 
adequate immune response. Given the favourable safety profile of ronapreve it is acceptable not to 
exclude these patients from treatment. 
The baseline characteristics are compared in the overall population; there are some imbalances in the 
serostatus, which might be linked to the imbalance in days since symptom onset. Since the main 
efficacy population is the seronegative population, this difference is not meaningful. 
With regard to oxygen support, “simple oxygen” might comparable with supplemental oxygen not 
requiring high flow. Thus, the populations in the two studies might be similar in this respect. The 
Applicant can confirm that the simple oxygen respiratory support in RECOVERY is equivalent to the 
low-flow supplemental oxygen respiratory support group (Cohort 1) in COV-2066. A side-by-side 
summary of all-cause mortality at Day 28 (RECOVERY) and Day 29 (COV-2066) in seronegative 
patients on simple oxygen/low-flow supplemental oxygen at randomization is provided for RECOVERY 
and COV-2066. 
Between the two studies, there is a slight imbalance with regard to corticosteroids at baseline in the 
overall population. However, this does not necessarily reflect the severity of disease; it might just 
reflect medical practice.  
The RECOVERY results are discussed in detail above. In summary a significant reduction in 28-day 
mortality was observed in seronegative participants receiving casirivimab+imdevimab compared to 
those receiving usual care alone (24% vs. 30%; RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70-0.91; p=0.001). Among all 
participants randomized (i.e., those with negative, positive, or unknown serostatus at baseline) the 
estimated effect of casirivimab+imdevimab on 28-day mortality was small and not significant (20% vs. 
21%; RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86-1.03; p=0.17). The respective second primary endpoint 28-day 
mortality in all randomised participants was not met. 
Participants that were seropositive at baseline had no added benefit from treatment with 
casirivimab+imedvimab compared to usual care alone (16% vs. 15%; RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.95-1.26). 
This estimated effect is substantially different from the effect in seronegatives (heterogeneity p-value, 
p=0.001). The results from COV-2066 (combined doses) in participants receiving no supplemental 
oxygen or low-flow supplemental oxygen were directionally consistent but not significant.  
With regard to additional key efficacy outcomes and secondary outcomes, the results from COV-2066 
were in general directionally consistent. 
Results were provided by baseline antibody status. In contrast to RECOVERY, less favourable outcomes 
under treatment for seropositive patients at baseline were not observed in study COV-2066.   
An observed difference in the outcome between the two studies is striking e.g., the mortality in 
RECOVERY is consistent higher in all groups / populations. A similar observation was made for key 
efficacy outcomes and secondary endpoints. The MAH provided comprehensive explanation for 
Page 135/173 
 
  
 
 
 
observed difference in the outcome between the RECOVERY and Study 2066. The differences are partly 
due to the design of the studies e.g., eligibility criteria and to the evolving epidemiological situation. 
The argumentation was accepted. Notable differences in eligibility criteria between the two studies that 
may have contributed to the overall disease severity of the patient populations and to the differences 
in mortality rates and effect sizes include the following: Respiratory support, additional organ support, 
time from symptom onset to randomization, time from hospitalization to randomization.  
The presentation of results from RECOVERY and COV-2066 is inconsistent and uses different scales 
(RR vs RRR). The MAH was asked to provide results on a comparable scale (e.g., RR) in the overall 
population and in subgroups of serostatus and discuss between-study-heterogeneity in a meta-analytic 
approach. The applicant provided results from both studies (RECOVERY and COV-2066) on the same 
scale (RR). Data from study 2066 are now based on the full analysis set (FAS), instead of the mFAS as 
previously reported. This is endorsed. Study 2066 results now also include other cohorts, which is in 
principle supported. It does not seem reasonable to exclude subgroups from one study, but not from 
the other. Recruitment in the cohorts 2 and 3 (high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation) in study COV-
2066 was put on hold following a DMC recommendation. Respective uncertainty should be seen in 
conjunction with results from RECOVERY and was accepted. 
In conclusion, the MAH provided comprehensive explanation for observed difference in the outcome 
between the RECOVERY and Study 2066. The differences are partly due to the design of the studies 
e.g., eligibility criteria and also to the evolving epidemiological situation. The argumentation is 
accepted. 
2.4.4.  
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
RECOVERY is an ongoing investigator-initiated complex randomised controlled, open-label platform 
trial with a factorial design in which several treatments are compared against control (not receiving the 
treatment) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to investigate their effect on 28-day mortality. 
The primary analysis of the REGN-COV-2 part of this open-label study was initially planned to be 
conducted in all randomized subjects but was restricted to seronegatives in a very late amendment. 
28-day mortality was significantly lower in seronegative patients randomised to REGN-COV-2 as 
compared to control. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall population, and a 
slightly higher mortality in seropositive participants (16% vs 15%) was observed. A large portion of 
patients had unclear serostatus (14%). Considering the results, the CHMP proposed an indication 
limited to patients on supplemental oxygen with a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody result. This is 
accepted by the MAH. The adaptive phase 1/2/3 study COV-2066 was prematurely terminated and 
only after the decision to terminate the study, the protocol specified that the exploratory phase 2 
cohort 1A and the confirmatory phase 3 cohort 1 would be pooled. Although the primary virological 
endpoints were met, the primary clinical endpoint was not met. However, point estimates in the 
seronegative subgroup are directionally consistent with the results observed in RECOVERY, although of 
different magnitude. 
No integrated analysis of the efficacy data of the two studies is provided, the MAH provided a 
comparative analysis. A difference in the outcome between the two studies is observed e.g., the 
mortality in RECOVERY is consistently higher in all groups / populations and the effect estimates are of 
a somewhat different magnitude. A similar observation was made for key efficacy outcomes and 
secondary endpoints. The observed differences in the outcome between the RECOVERY and Study 
2066 are partly due to the design of the studies e.g., eligibility criteria and also to the evolving 
epidemiological situation.

2.5.   Clinical safety 
Introduction 
RECOVERY Trial 
Patients could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care 
●  azithromycin versus no additional treatment (Part A; 7 April 2020 – 27 November 
2020) 
● 
colchicine versus no additional treatment (Part A; 19 November 2020 – 5 March 2021) 
●  dimethyl fumarate no additional treatment (Part A; 15 February 2021 – ongoing) 
●  aspirin versus no additional treatment (Part C; 1 November 2020 – 21 March 2021) 
●  baricitinib versus no additional treatment (Part D; 26 January 2021 – ongoing) 
All patients received study medication on top of standard of care. More than > 90 % of the patients 
received corticosteroids at baseline.  
RECOVERY balanced safety data collection with practical considerations to ensure that only key safety 
outcomes were captured, including the following: 
• 
Targeted safety events in all participants randomized to casirivimab+imdevimab consisting of 
Suspected serious adverse reactions (SSARs), Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs), and all deaths and underlying cause of death (Protocol Version 9.1 Section 4.1, 
Appendix 2). Per the protocol, only events believed with a reasonable possibility to be due to 
the study treatment were considered as SSARs. Since there were no expected events for 
casirivimab+imdevimab, all SSARs were considered SUSARs. To streamline data collection and 
since a matching placebo was not administered, similar events were not collected for the usual 
care group, making comparative assessment of these events to an appropriate control group, 
not possible. 
•  Additional relevant safety data for all participants randomized to either casirivimab+imdevimab 
or usual care included: all-cause mortality; cause-specific mortality; major bleeding events 
Page 137/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
(overall and by type, introduced in Protocol Version 10.1); major cardiac arrhythmias 
(including type of arrhythmia) and non-coronavirus infection (added with Protocol Version 
14.0). These data were collected as binary and, therefore, did not include traditional safety 
collection parameters such as mapping of verbatim terms, duration of events, or severity 
grade of events or outcomes. 
•  Early safety data was collected within 72 hours for a subset of participants (ESAF). The focus 
of data collection was on those events that, based on a single case, were highly likely to be 
related to the study medication, such as anaphylaxis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, or bone 
marrow failure, or events for which there was no other plausible explanation. In addition, 
specific assessments included binary data collection of: (i) sudden worsening in respiratory 
status; (ii) severe allergic reaction; (iii) temperature > 39°C or >2°C rise since randomization; 
(iv) sudden hypotension; (v) clinical haemolysis; (vi) thrombotic event (type of event); (vii) 
was infusion stopped early; (viii) did participant have a reaction during the infusion and how 
was the reaction managed. These data were collected both for the casirivimab+imdevimab 
group and the usual care group. These data did not include traditional safety collection 
parameters such as mapping of verbatim terms, duration of events or events severity grades 
or outcome. 
Follow-up information was collected on all study participants regardless of whether they completed the 
scheduled course of allocated study treatment for a period of up to 10 years. The end of the study is 
expected to be the date of the final data extraction from NHS Digital. 
COV-2066 
Participants were randomized to receive a single IV dose of either 2400 mg (1200 mg of casirivimab 
plus 1200 mg imdevimab), 8000 mg (4000 mg of casirivimab plus 4000 mg imdevimab) or placebo. All 
participants received background standard of care treatment for COVID-19 per local guidelines. 
The analysis of safety data was performed for Cohort 1 in combined Phases 1, 2 and 3, and Cohorts 
1A, 2 and 3 in Phase 2, separately in the full analysis set (FAS). 
The study population of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was expected to have a complicated 
disease presentation at baseline that could quickly and unexpectedly deteriorate. As such, their TEAE 
profile was expected to be complex and dynamic. Mainly due to their underlying COVID-19 disease, 
which affects multiple organ systems and exacerbates concurrent clinical conditions considered risk 
factors for severe COVID-19. Therefore, a targeted safety data collection was performed, collecting 
relevant TEAEs in order to reduce background noise and effectively evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of casirivimab+imdevimab. This included key safety concerns expected for mAbs against exogenous 
targets and unexpected severe or serious TEAEs. The targeted subset of TEAEs included the following: 
●  All phases: treatment-emergent AESIs defined as: 
o  Grade > 2 hypersensitivity through day 29 
o  Grade ε  2 IRRs through day 4 
●  All phases: treatment-emergent SAEs 
●  Phase 1 (Cohort 1): Grade ε 3 TEAEs 
The safety analysis was based on the reported SAEs and AESIs and other safety information (clinical 
laboratory evaluations and vital signs). 
Population analysed 
RECOVERY 
Safety analyses were performed in 2 populations: 
Page 138/173 
 
  
 
 
 
●  The all randomized patients population, consisting of all randomized patients allocated to either 
the usual care plus casirivimab+imdevimab group (n=4839) or the usual care group (n=4946) 
(Table 1). 
●  Early Safety Population (ESAF), a subset of the All randomized patients population for whom 
additional safety data were collected within 72 hours after randomization (n=1792 in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group and n=1715 in the usual care group) (Table 1). As pre-defined 
in the protocol, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed early safety data and 
recommended that this additional data collection was stopped on 17 Feb 2021 (Sandercock, 
2021). 
Of all the randomized patients population, 495 patients who were randomized to the 
casirivimab+imdevimab treatment arm did not receive the assigned treatment and for 46 patients it is 
unknown whether they were treated due to missing data (Table 1). All analyses are presented for the 
randomized population, regardless of whether treatment was received. 
COV-2066 
The Safety population (SAF) included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the 
study drug. Analysis of the Safety population was done according to the treatment received (as 
treated). 
Patient exposure 
The safety evaluation for hospitalized patients is based on 5771 participants in the randomized clinical 
studies (4298 in RECOVERY (of 4839 participants randomized to casirivimab+imdevimab), 4298 (90%) 
received the dose and 1473 in COV-2066) who received a single IV dose of casirivimab+imdevimab. Of 
these participants: 
●  5031 (4298 in RECOVERY and 733 in COV-2066) received 8000 mg 
●  740 (in COV-2066) received 2400 mg 
Overall, the majority of participants in RECOVERY (81.3%; [3495/4298]) had been followed up for at 
least 4 weeks. Data were only available for up to 4 weeks of follow-up for RECOVERY, while the 
majority of participants in COV-2066 (73.3% [1080/1473]) had been followed up for at least 8 weeks. 
A confirmed total of 46 participants (46/6312 [0.7%]) in COV-2066 had been followed up for at least 
16 weeks.  
Adverse events 
RECOVERY 
Collection of safety parameters in RECOVERY was focused on Suspected serious adverse reactions 
(SSARs) (which are those events that, based on a single case likely with a reasonable probability to be 
Page 139/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
related to the study medication) and infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions, which were 
collected only in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and not the usual care group since no placebo 
comparator IV infusion was given.  
Six of these patients experienced SSARs that resolved: 
●  3 allergic reaction events (1 IRR and 2 events of acute allergic reactions; occurring within 72 
hours, these three events were also considered IRRs and 1 acute allergic reaction was 
considered a severe allergic reaction 
●  2 events of seizure 
●  1 event of transient loss of consciousness (unconsciousness). 
One patient had experienced a SSAR with an outcome ‘unknown’: 
●  1 acute desaturation (worsening hypoxia) 
Three participants experienced events (reported as allergic reaction) that were considered infusion-
related reactions during the infusion (see below).  
COV-2066 
Pooled Analysis (All Phases All Cohorts) 
A higher proportion of participants in the placebo group experienced treatment-emergent SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to death, compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab groups (combined and individual 
doses) (Table 7). The incidence of treatment-emergent AESIs (Grade > 2 IRRs and Grade > 2 
hypersensitivity reactions) were low in all treatment groups (< 2% in any treatment or placebo group) 
(Table 7). TEAEs that led to withdrawal from the study and infusion interruption were low (< 0.5% in 
any treatment or placebo group); TEAEs that led to study infusion discontinuation were also low (< 
0.7%) (Table 7). 
Page 140/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The frequency of treatment-emergent AEs was 28.6% (209/730 participants) in the placebo group, 
25.8% (191/740 participants) in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group, 27.4% [201/733 
participants) in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group and 26.6% (392/1473 participants) 
in the combined doses (Table 7). 
The SOCs that contained the most frequently reported events which were higher for any 
casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to placebo were: 
●  General disorders and administration site conditions: 3.0% (22/740 participants) in the 2400 
mg group, 3.3% (24/733 participants) in the 8000 mg group, and 2.1% (15/730 participants) 
in the placebo group 
●  Vascular disorders: 1.5% (11/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 2.2% (16/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg group, and 1.4% (10/730 participants) in the placebo group 
Page 141/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
●  Gastrointestinal disorders: 1.1% (8/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 2.0% (15/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg group, and 1.8% (13/730 participants) in the placebo group 
The most frequently reported PTs (>2%) where events were higher for any casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose compared to placebo were: 
●  Acute respiratory failure: 3.5% (26/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 2.3%(17/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg group, and 3.3% (24/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  COVID-19: 2.4% (18/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 4.5% (33/733 participants) in 
the 8000 mg group, and 4.1% (30/730 participants) in the placebo group 
Adverse Events Related to Treatment 
The number of participants with at least one related TEAE was higher in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
groups (2.3% in the 2400 mg dose group, 3.1% in the 8000 mg dose group) compared to placebo 
(1.5%) (Table 8).
Related TEAEs were reported at a higher frequency in one or both of the casirivimab+imdevimab dose 
groups compared to the placebo group in the following SOCs (> 4 participants) (Table 8): 
●  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: 0.8% (6/740 participants) in the 2400 mg 
group; 1.0% (7/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; and 0.3% (2/730 participants) 
in the placebo group 
●  General disorders and administration site conditions: 0.5% (4/740 participants) in the 2400 
mg group; 0.8% (6/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in 
the placebo group 
●  Cardiac Disorders: 0.1% (1/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group; 0.7% (5/733 participants) 
in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/730 participants) in the placebo group 
Page 142/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported PTs (> 2 participants) where events were higher for any 
casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to placebo were: 
●  Dyspnoea (0 in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group; 0.5% [4/733 participants] in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0 in the placebo group) 
●  Hypoxia (0.5% [4/733 participants] in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group; 0.4% 
[3/733 participants] in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0 in the placebo group) 
●  Chills (0.3% [2/740 participants] in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group, 0.4% [3/733 
participants] in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0.1% [1/730 participants] in the 
placebo group) 
●  Anxiety (0 in the in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group; 0.3% [2/733 participants] in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0 in the placebo group) 
●  Pyrexia (0 in the in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group; 0.4% [3/733 participants] in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0 in the placebo group) 
●  Flushing: 0 in the in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group; 0.3% [2/733 participants] in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group; 0 in the placebo group) 
Adverse Events by Intensity 
A total of 17% (378/2203 participants) of all participants had at least one Grade 3 or 4 TEAE (Table 7). 
A higher percentage of participants in the placebo group experienced Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (19.0% 
[139/740 participants]), compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (15.1% 
[112/740 participants]), and the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (17.3% [127/733 
participants]) (Table 7). 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported at a numerically higher frequency in either casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose group compared to placebo in the following SOCs: 
●  Vascular disorders: 0.81% (6/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 1.5% (11/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 1.1% (8/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 0.7% (5/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 
1.1% (8/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.8% (6/730 participants) in the 
placebo group 
● 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: 0.4% (3/740 participants) in the 2400 mg 
dose group; 1.1% (8/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.8% (6/730 participants) 
in the placebo group 
The most frequently reported PTs (> 2 participants) where events were higher for any 
casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to placebo were: 
●  Hypotension: 0.3% (2/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.7% (5/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.5% (4/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Deep vein thrombosis: 0.1% (1/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Acidosis: 0 participants in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 participants) in the 8000 mg 
dose group; 0 participants in the placebo group 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Adverse Events of Special Interest and Selected Adverse Events 
Early Safety Outcomes (72 hours after randomization) –  
RECOVERY 
Page 143/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Early safety outcome data were recorded within 72 hours (based on the ESAF) after randomization for 
the first 1792 casirivimab+imdevimab participants and the first 1715 usual care participants. 
Page 144/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Page 145/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between the casirivimab+imdevimab group and the 
usual care group among all randomized participants. There were a few imbalances in specific targeted 
safety outcomes. The early safety outcomes that occurred in a higher (>0.3% difference) proportion of 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared to the usual care group were: new non-
invasive use of O2 (6.2% vs. 8.5%), temperature > 39°C or > 2°C rise above temperature at 
randomization (fever) (4.4% vs. 3.0%), sudden hypotension (3.7% vs. 2.3%), and thrombotic events 
(1.7% vs. 1.4%), sudden worsening in respiratory status (21.7% vs. 20.6%) and clinical haemolysis 
(1.8% vs. 1.5%).  
Five participants across both treatment groups (4/1792 participants in the ESAF randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab and 1/1715 participants in the ESAF randomized to usual care) experienced a 
severe allergic reaction.  
Page 146/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
IRRs were collected for the casirivimab+imdevimab group and not for the usual care group (as 
treatment did not include infusion). 
Twenty (1.1%) participants had an IRR (Table 12). Of these 20 participants with an IRR, 7 (0.4%) 
were treated with an antihistamine and 2 (0.1%) were treated with a steroid. None of the participants 
who had an IRR required adrenaline treatment. Study drug infusion was discontinued early due to an 
IRR in 10 (0.6%) participants. Data regarding IRRs for participants randomized to the usual care group 
were not collected. Of the 20 reported IRRs, 3 events were also reported as severe allergic reactions. 
Select safety data for all randomized participants 
An online follow-up form was completed by site staff when participants were discharged, had died, or 
at 28 days after randomization, whichever occurred first to provide additional safety information. 
Selected safety data were collected and analysed for 4839 participants randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab and 4946 participants randomized to usual care. These data included the 
subset of participants from the ESAF. These data were collected as binary outcomes and did not have 
traditional safety collection parameters such as mapping of verbatim terms or toxicity grading.  
All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality 
Consistent with treatment benefit, in the seronegative population all-cause 28-day mortality, as well as 
COVID-19 related mortality, was lower in the casirivimab+imdevimab group compared to the usual 
care group (24.2% vs. 29.7% and 22.7% vs. 28.4% respectively). This was not observed in the 
seropositive population. 
In the overall population, all cause mortality as well as COVID-related mortality in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group compared to the usual care group was 19.5% vs 20.8% and 18.5% vs 
20.0%, respectively. The terms for the fatal events reported were consistent with advanced COVID-19 
and its complications and worsening comorbid clinical conditions of hospitalised patients. 
Major cardiac arrhythmia 
Page 147/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The frequency of cardiac arrhythmia events was numerically higher in the usual care group compared 
to the casirivimab+imdevimab group in the overall population (4.4% vs. 3.9%, respectively) and 
seronegative population (4.5% vs. 3.3%, respectively).  
Thrombosis and major bleeding 
In the overall population, the frequency of any thrombotic event was comparable in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care groups (5.2% vs. 5.1% in the in casirivimab+imdevimab and 
usual care groups) and the frequency of any major bleeding was similar between the groups (1.5% vs. 
1.8% casirivimab+imdevimab and usual car groups). In the seronegative population, the frequency of 
thrombosis (3.6% vs. 4.3%) and major bleeding events (1.3% vs. 1.4%) was similar between the 
casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care groups.  
COV-2066 
Death 
A higher percentage of participants in the placebo group experienced TEAEs that led to death (14.7% 
[107/730]), compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (12.2% [90/740]), the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (12.1% [89/733]), and the combined doses group 
(12.2% [179/1473]). 
TEAEs leading to death were reported at a higher frequency in either casirivimab+imdevimab dose 
group compared to placebo in the following SOC:  
● 
Infections and infestations: 2.8% (21/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 5.2% 
(38/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 4.5% (33/730 participants) in the placebo 
group 
The most frequently reported event PTs (> 2 participants) leading to death and occurring at a higher 
rate in either casirivimab+imdevimab dose group compared to placebo were: 
●  Acute respiratory failure: 2.7% (20/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 1.8% 
(13/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 2.1% (15/730 participants) in the placebo 
group 
●  COVID-19: 1.5% (11/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 3.0% (22/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 2.1% (15/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome: 0.4% (3/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 
1.1% (8/733 participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.5% (4/730 participants) in the 
placebo group 
●  Cardiac arrest: 0.9% (7/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.5% (4/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.5% (4/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Septic shock: 0.4% (3/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.7% (5/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.5% (4/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Pulmonary embolism: 0.4% (3/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0 participants in 
the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Acute myocardial infarction: 0 participants in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 
participants) in the 8000 mg dose group; 0 participants in the placebo group 
In 2.1% (6/286) of participants that had at least 1 TEAE leading to death, the TEAEs leading to death 
were evaluated by the investigators to be treatment-related: Two participants each in the 2400 mg 
dose group (one in Cohort 1 [PT Acute respiratory failure] and one in Cohort 2 [PT: Hypoxia), 8000 mg 
dose group (both in Cohort 1; PTs: Hypoxia, and Respiratory failure), and placebo group (both in 
Cohort 1; PTs: Hypoxia, and Superinfection bacterial). Of note, none of these 6 events were 
considered by the Sponsor to be treatment-related. 
Phase 2 enrolment of Cohort 2 and 3 was paused per iDMC recommendation due to an observed 
imbalance of deaths in the treatment groups compared to placebo. The Sponsor conducted a thorough 
Page 148/173 
 
  
 
 
 
assessment of these deaths and it was determined not to be treatment related, but considered 
primarily due to worsening COVID-19 disease and participants’ concurrent medical conditions. 
Cohort 2 
A greater percentage of participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab groups compared to the placebo 
group experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to death. The percentages of participants with at least 1 
TEAE leading to death was 44.6% (25/56) in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group, 35.2% 
(19/54) in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group, and 25.5% (13/51) in the placebo group. 
The majority of TEAEs that led to death were in the Infections and infestations and Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC, which was consistent with the participant population having 
advanced COVID-19 disease and progression of COVID-19 infection, resulting in respiratory failure and 
a fatal outcome (Table 45). A higher percentage of participants experienced death in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab groups compared to the placebo group due to TEAE PTs including COVID-19, 
COVID-19 pneumonia, Acute respiratory failure, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Cardiac arrest, 
and Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 
All but 1 of the TEAEs that led to death were considered not related to study drug by the investigator, 
and were assessed to be caused by advanced and progressive COVID-19 disease, participants’ 
underlying clinical comorbidities, or demographic characteristic such as older age. One participant in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group had a TEAE of worsening hypoxia (PT: Hypoxia) leading to 
death >14 days after treatment, that was considered related to study treatment by the investigator 
but not by the Sponsor. This participant’s status had recently been changed to DNI, and the participant 
was transferred to comfort care measures. The Sponsor considered the event as secondary to 
progression of underlying COVID-19.

A greater percentage of participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab groups compared to the placebo 
group experienced TEAE leading to death: The percentages of participants with at least 1 TEAE leading 
to death was 66.7% (8/12) in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group compared to the 
placebo group (58.3% [7/12]), and casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose groups (36.4% [4/11]. 
On analysis of TEAEs that resulted in a fatal outcome, the following 6 TEAEs (by PT) were experienced 
by ≥2 participants in any casirivimab+imdevimab treatment groups: respiratory failure, acute 
respiratory failure, COVID-19, and cardiac arrest. 
Serious adverse events 
A post-hoc pooled safety analysis across all cohorts and all phases showed that 25.5 (561/2203) of all 
participants had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE. The frequency of treatment-emergent SAEs was 
higher in the placebo group (27.8% [203/730 participants]) compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab 
2400 mg dose group (23.9% [177/740 participants]), the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose 
group (24.7% [181/733 participants]), and the combined doses (24.3% [358/1473 participants]).  
The most frequently reported SOCs where treatment-emergent SAEs were numerically higher for any 
casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to placebo were: 
General disorder and administration site conditions: 2.4% (18/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 
1.9% (14/733 participants) in the 8000 mg group, and 1.9% (14/730 participants) in the placebo 
group 
Vascular disorders: 0.9% (7/740 participants) in the 2400 mg group, 1.5% (11/733 participants) in 
the 8000 mg group, and 1.2% (9/730 participants) in the placebo group 
The most frequently reported PTs (> 2 participants) where events were higher for any 
casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to placebo were: 
●  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.4% [3/740 participants] in the 2400 mg dose group; 
1.1% [8/733 participants] in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.7% [5/730 participants] in the 
placebo group) 
Page 150/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
●  Death (0.7% [5/740 participants] in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.1% [1/733 participants] in 
the 8000 mg dose group; 0.5% [4/730 participants] in the placebo group) 
●  Chest pain 0.4% [3/740 participants] in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% [2/733 participants] in 
the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% [1/730 participants] in the placebo group) 
Adverse events of special interest and selected adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AESIs (serious and non-serious) were defined as: 
•  Grade ≥ 2 IRRs through Day 4 
•  Grade ≥ 2 hypersensitivity reactions through Day 29 
A post-hoc pooled safety analysis across all cohorts and all phases showed that 2.0% (45/2203) of all 
participants experienced at least 1 treatment emergent AESI. More participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (2.2% [16/740]) and 8000 mg dose group (2.9% 
[21/733]) had at least 1 treatment emergent AESI, compared to the placebo group.  
Grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions through Day 4 
Overall, 32 participants experienced AESIs of Grade ≥2 IRRs through Day 4. A higher proportion of 
participants experienced Grade ≥2 IRRs in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (2.0%) 
and 2400 mg dose group (1.5%) compared to the placebo group (0.8%). 
The AESI PTs that were most frequently (> 2 participants) reported in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose groups compared to placebo were: 
●  Hypoxia: 0.4% (3/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.4% (3/733 participants) in 
the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Chills: 0 participants in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 participants) in the 8000 mg 
dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in the placebo group 
Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions through Day 29 
Overall, 14 participants experienced AESIs of Grade > 2 hypersensitivity, through 
Day 29. A higher proportion of participants experienced Grade > 2 hypersensitivity reactions in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (1.0%) and 2400 mg dose group (0.7%) compared to 
the placebo group (0.3%). 
The AESI PTs that were most frequently (> 2 participants) reported in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
dose groups compared to placebo were: 
●  Chills: 0.3% (2/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/733 participants) in the 
8000 mg dose group; 0 in the placebo group 
●  Dyspnoea: 0.3% (2/740 participants) in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/733 participants) 
in the 8000 mg dose group; 0.1% (1/730 participants) in the placebo group 
●  Headache: 0 participants in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 participants) in the 8000 
mg dose group; 0 participants in the placebo group 
●  Nausea: 0 participants in the 2400 mg dose group; 0.3% (2/733 participants) in the 8000 mg 
dose group; 0 participants in the placebo group 
Laboratory findings 
The RECOVERY trial did not collect data to evaluate haematology, clinical chemistry or immunogenicity. 
No clinically relevant changes in the available laboratory data and vital signs were observed in COV-
2066. Also, no new safety signal was identified based on the review of data. 
COV-2066

Haematology 
The most frequently reported PCSVs among the hematologic parameters were as follows: 
●  Red blood cells and platelets: decrease of ≥20 g/L in haemoglobin values 
●  White blood cells: abnormal monocyte values t 
●  Coagulation: abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time and abnormal prothrombin time  
Chemistry 
Treatment-emergent PCSVs compared to baseline were generally similar across all treatment and 
placebo groups for electrolytes (placebo: 9.6%, casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group: 7.9%, 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group: 7.9%) and liver function (placebo: 11.2%, 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group: 11.1%, casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group: 12.3%). 
Treatment-emergent PCSVs for metabolic function during the study compared to baseline were slightly 
higher in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group compared to the placebo and slightly lower in 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group compared to placebo (placebo: 44.9%, 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group: 43.3%, casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group: 50.5%. 
Treatment-emergent PCSVs for renal function during the study period compared to baseline were 
slightly higher in the placebo group compared to either treatment group and both treatment groups 
combined (placebo: 23.8%, casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group: 19.6%, casirivimab+imdevimab 
8000 mg group: 19.6%) (Table 10). 
Page 152/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Overall, there were 6 participants (4 participants in the placebo group, 1 participant in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group and 1 participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg 
group) with liver enzyme elevations that met the criteria for Hy’s Law (maximum post-baseline total 
bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 30 days after maximum post-baseline alanine 
transaminase or aspartate aminotransferase > 3x ULN, without findings of cholestasis, defined as 
alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN) (l_300_hylaw). The participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab treated 
groups both had relevant medical history including viral infections (Hepatitis and HIV)Considering the 
participants’ relevant comorbidities, the liver enzyme elevations are considered likely related to 
underlying medical conditions and/or COVID-19, and not related to casirivimab+imdevimab treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
The majority of participants in this study were ADA negative for casirivimab and imdevimab. Of the 
patients with treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA, greater than 95% of patients dosed with 
casirivimab+imdevimab had low (<1,000) maximum titre, with no high titre responses observed. 
There was no impact of immunogenicity on concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum. 
Concentrations in serum for casirivimab and imdevimab at Day 28 (i.e., Study Day 29) were similar 
between ADA negative and ADA-positive patients, with the majority of samples being ADA-negative.

Safety in special populations 
RECOVERY 
Age 
There were 11 adolescent participants (ages ranging from 12 to 17 years) in the RECOVERY trial (4 
randomized to the casirivimab+imdevimab and 7 to standard care). There were no deaths, SUSARs or 
SSARs reported among this group. Five of the 11 adolescent patients were in the subset of participants 
who had early safety assessments. Of the five patients, 2 were in the casirivimab+imdevimab group 
and neither experienced an allergic reaction, fever, sudden hypotension, thrombotic events or clinical 
haemolysis.  
The incidence of severe allergic reaction was the same between participants who were >65 years of 
age and those who were >18 to <65 years of age (0.2% in both groups) (Table 17). In the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group, the overall incidence of sudden worsening in respiratory status, 
temperature > 39°C or > 2°C rise above baseline, sudden hypotension, clinical haemolysis and 
thrombotic event was higher (> 0.3% difference) among participants who were >65 years of age 
compared to those who were >18 to <65 years of age (Table 17). This was expected, as the >65 
years age group is at higher risk of complications/progression to severe COVID-19 infection and are 
observed in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. 
In the usual care group, the incidence of sudden worsening in respiratory status, sudden hypotension, 
and thrombotic events was higher (>0.3% difference) among participants who were < 65 years of age 
compared to those who were >18 to < 65 years of age; while, the incidence of temperature > 39°C or 
>2° C rise above baseline and clinical haemolysis was higher (>0.3% difference) among participants 
who were >18 to <65 years of age compared to those who were >65 years of age.

Gender 
In the casirivimab+imdevimab group, the incidence of sudden worsening in respiratory status and 
temperature > 39°C or > 2°C rise above baseline, were higher (≥0.3% difference) in men compared 
to women, while the incidence of sudden hypotension and thrombotic event was higher (≥0.3% 
difference) in women compared to men. The incidence of severe allergic reaction and clinical 
haemolysis was comparable between men and women (Table 18). 
In the usual care group, the incidence of thrombotic event was higher (≥0.3% difference) in men 
compared to women, while the incidence of sudden worsening in respirator status, sudden 
hypotension, and clinical haemolysis was higher (≥0.3% difference) in women compared to men. The 
incidence of severe allergic reaction and temperature >39°C or > 2°C rise above baseline was 
comparable between men and women (Table 18).

Ethnicity 
In the casirivimab+imdevimab group, the incidence of sudden worsening in respiratory status, severe 
allergic reaction and thrombotic event was higher (>0.3% difference) among White people compared 
to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic and unknown (Table 19). The incidence of sudden hypotension was 
higher (>0.3% difference) in the Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic group compared to the White and 
Unknown groups (Table 19). The incidence of temperature > 39°C or > 2°C rise above baseline was 
higher (>0.3% difference) in the unknown group compared to the White and Black, Asian, and Minority 
Ethnic groups. The incidence of clinical haemolysis was equivalent between the White and Black, Asian, 
and Minority Ethnic groups (Table 19). 
In the usual care group, the incidence of sudden worsening in respiratory status was higher (>0.3% 
difference) in the White people compared to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic and unknown (Table 19). 
The incidence of sudden hypotension and clinical haemolysis was higher (>0.3% difference) in the 
Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic group compared to the White and Unknown groups. The incidence of 
temperature > 39°C or >2°C rise above baseline was comparable between the White and the Black, 
Asian, and Minority Ethnic groups (Table 19); while the incidence of severe allergic reaction and 
thrombotic event was comparable between all 3 ethnic groups (Table 19). 
Pregnancy and lactation 
By-participant data was collected for participants who were pregnant at baseline and included the day 
of hospital discharge or death, but not outcomes. There were 26 participants that were pregnant at 
randomization; 18 pregnant participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group (3 were not treated) and 
8 pregnant participants in the usual care group (4 were not treated). Of these participants, all but 2 
were discharged from the hospital. One participant was recorded as having a fatal outcome (in the 
usual care group on Study Day 12) and there was no discharge information for the other participant 
(usual care group). Further details on pregnancy outcome are not available in the safety database.

COV-2066 
Age 
Among the pooled phases and cohorts, the incidence of TEAEs, TE SAEs, and TEAEs leading to death 
was higher in the >65 years age subgroup compared to the 18 to < 65 years age group in both the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg and 8000 mg dose groups (Table 20). The incidence of TE AESI of 
IRRs (Grade >2) through Day 4 was slightly higher in the 18 to < 65 years age group compared to the 
>65 years age group for the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (1.7% vs. 1.3%, 
respectively) and higher in the >65 years age subgroup compared to the 18 to < 65 years age group 
in the 8000 mg dose group (2.8% vs. 1.5%, respectively) but the number of participants with these 
events was small. The incidence of TE AESI of hypersensitivity reactions (Grade >2) through Day 29 
was comparable between the age groups in the 2400 mg dose group (0.3% vs. 0.2% in the 18 to < 65 
years vs. >65 years age groups, respectively) but was higher in the 18 to < 65 years age group 
compared to the >65 years age subgroup in the 8000 mg dose group (1.5% vs. 0.3% respectively) 
(Table 20).

Gender 
Gender 
Among the pooled phases and cohorts, the incidence of TEAEs, TE SAEs, TE AESI of hypersensitivity 
reactions (Grade >2) through Day 29 and TEAEs leading to death was higher among males compared 
to females in both the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg and 8000 mg dose groups (Table 21). The 
incidence of TE AESI of infusion-related reactions (Grade >2) through Day 4 was comparable between 
males and females in both the 2400 mg dose group (Males: 1.5% [6/411 participants]; Females: 1.5% 
[5/329 participants]) and the 8000 mg dose group (Males: 2.0% [8/399 participants]; Females: 2.1% 
[7/334 participants]) (Table 21). 
Race 
Among the pooled phases and cohorts, the incidence of TEAEs, TE SAEs, TE AESI of hypersensitivity 
reactions (Grade >2) through Day 29, TE AESI of infusion-related reactions (Grade >2) through Day 4 
and TEAEs leading to death was higher among White people compared to all other race categories in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group and 8000 mg dose group. It should be noted that the 
majority of the participants in COV-2066 were White. The incidence of TEAEs, TE SAEs, TE AESI of 
hypersensitivity reactions (Grade >2) through Day 29, TE AESI of infusion related reactions (Grade > 
2) through Day 4 and TEAEs leading to death was comparable among those whose race was unknown 
or not reported between both dose groups (Table 22).

Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for COV-2066; however, there were 2 cases of pregnancy 
reported during the study: 
• 
• 
The first case concerned a woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and randomized to 
receive casirivimab+imdevimab treatment. On the day she signed the informed consent, she 
received casirivimab+imdevimab and subsequently took her first urine pregnancy test with a 
positive result for pregnancy. At the time of treatment, she was in the second trimester of 
pregnancyt. She delivered a healthy female baby with no complications.  
The second case concerned a female participant who became pregnant while enrolled in COV-
2066. Upon admission to hospital, she had a negative urine pregnancy test. She received 
casirivimab+imdevimab prior to becoming pregnant; however, she was still enrolled in the 
study. The pregnancy is currently ongoing.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are 
monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; 
therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, 
inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
RECOVERY 
Three participants experienced infusion-related events (PT: Hypersensitivity [2 participants]; PT 
Infusion-related reaction [1 participant]). All 3 events resulted in treatment discontinuation and were 
reported as a SSAR.  
COV-2066 
Infusion discontinuations 
Four participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (0.5% [4/740 participants], with 
reported PTs: Chest pain, Infusion site extravasation, and Chills [2 participants]) and 5 participants in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (0.7% [5/733 participants], with reported PTs: 
Infusion related reaction, Hypoxia, Anxiety, Pruritus in 1 participant each; Dyspnoea and Tachypnoea 
in 1 participant), experienced TEAEs leading to infusion discontinuation. There were no TEAEs leading 
to infusion discontinuation in the placebo group. 
Page 159/173 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
Infusion interruptions 
Overall, TEAEs leading to infusion interruption were observed in 1 participant in the placebo group 
(0.1% [1/730]; PT: Hypoxia), 1 participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (0.1% 
[1/740]; with reported PT: Arthralgia), and 3 participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose 
group (0.4% [1/733]; with reported PTs: Dyspnoea, Tachycardia and Hypoxia). 
Withdrawal from Study 
Two participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group (1 participant with a reported PT 
of Acute Respiratory Failure also had a fatal outcome; 1 participant with the reported PT: Fall) and 1 
participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group (PT: Pruritus; also lead to infusion 
discontinuation), experienced TEAEs leading to study withdrawal. There were no TEAEs leading to 
study withdrawal in the placebo group 
Dose Modification 
Since this was a single dose study, dose modifications were not permitted. 
Post marketing experience 
As of 30 November 2021, Ronapreve has been approved for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 in 
several countries, as well as EUAs in other countries.  
In order to ensure a comprehensive safety assessment of available data from outside of the Ronapreve 
clinical trial program, non-interventional study/EUA/Compassionate use data were evaluated and 
combined with the post-marketing data from Japan and the UK. 
A search of the Roche Global Safety Database up to 30 November 2021, retrieved a total of 8748 
events corresponding to 3117 cases (spontaneous: 824 cases; literature: 47 cases; non-interventional 
study/program: 2228 cases). Of the 3117 cases, 1138 cases were serious (1043 medically confirmed) 
and 1961 cases were non-serious (1253 medically confirmed).  
Overall, the 5 most frequently reported SOCs were: General disorders and administration site 
conditions (2352 events); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (949 event); Nervous 
system disorders (876 events); Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (840 events); and 
Gastrointestinal disorders (714 events). 
The most frequently reported PTs (>150 events) were: Pyrexia (581 events); No adverse event (352 
events); Chills (311 events); Nausea (271 events); Dyspnoe (263 events); Off label use (244 events); 
Oxygen saturation decreased (203 events); Headache (183 events); Dizziness (155 events). 
Hypersensitivity 
A total of 452 cases (575 events) of Hypersensitivity were identified as having PTs falling within 
Hypersensitivity SMQ (narrow). 
The most frequently reported Hypersensitivity reactions PTs (>15 events) were: Rash (115); Urticaria 
(109 events); Infusion related reaction (70 events); Hypersensitivity (36 events); Rash pruritic (25 
events); Anaphylactic reaction (22 events); and Lip swelling (17 events). 
Of the 452 cases, 140 cases were serious. Of these, 4 cases (Distributive shock [1 case]; Skin necrosis 
[1 case]; Anaphylactic reaction [2 cases]) involved a fatal outcome. The event of skin necrosis 
occurred more than 2 months after administration of Ronapreve and was considered unrelated to 
Ronapreve by the Applicant. The event of Distributive shock was considered to be most likely due to 
underlying medical condition of the patient. Of the 2 remaining reports of anaphylactic reaction, both 
patients had risk factors for severe COVID-19. For one report, time from the initial COVID-19 
symptoms to administration of Ronapreve was not reported.  
Page 160/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Lack of efficacy 
A total of 36 cases involving lack of efficacy have been reported up to 30 November 2021. The cases 
were identified by review of relevant PTs within the HLT of Therapeutic and non-therapeutic responses. 
The PTs within the cases were: Drug ineffective (30 events); Treatment failure (2 events); Therapeutic 
product effect decreased (2 events); Therapy non-responder and Therapeutic response decreased (1 
event each). 
Half of the cases (50%; 18/36) reported a lack of efficacy within 1 day of administration of Ronapreve. 
Of the remaining 18 cases, 4 cases had limited information and no information regarding time of 
COVID-19 onset and administration of Ronapreve; and 1 case involved neutropenia without response 
to Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), hence was not a lack of efficacy case for Ronapreve. 
For the remaining 13 cases, time from administration to reporting of lack of efficacy was not provided.  
Pregnancy 
Data from 171 pregnant patients (age range: 17 to 44 years) were available from clinical studies that 
allowed enrolment of pregnant women (COV-2066, COV-2067, COV-2069 and COV-20145), the 
RECOVERY trial, and from patients administered casirivimab+imdevimab under the non-interventional 
study/EUA/compassionate use program and from the post-marketing setting. 
There were 16 SAEs reported in patients receiving casirivimab+imdevimab; none of the SAEs were 
considered related to study drug (Ronapreve). 
Based on current data, the following outcomes were reported: 53 live births without congenital 
anomaly, 1 live birth with congenital anomaly, 5 premature births, 2 ectopic pregnancies, 3 stillbirths 
without foetal defects, 9 elective abortions (no foetal defects or unknown) and 7 spontaneous 
abortions. Sixty-seven cases were still awaiting outcome data and 24 cases had an unknown outcome. 
There were 14 cases with a reported SAE (including spontaneous abortion). The safety profile in 
pregnant patients was consistent with the known safety profile of Ronapreve. 
There are no available data on the presence of casirivimab and/or imdevimab in human milk or animal 
milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Maternal IgG is 
known to be present in human milk.  
2.5.1.  
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data base includes 5771 hospitalised patients; the majority, 5031 patients received the 
8000 mg dose and 740 patients received the 2400 mg dose. The observation period is depending on 
the study 4 to 8 weeks, with a few patients followed for 16 weeks. Give that this acceptable for a 
single dose application directed towards an exogenous target. 
The safety data collection addresses in RECOVERY deviated from traditional safety data collection. It 
was aimed to balanced safety data collection with practical considerations to ensure that only key 
safety outcomes were captured. Given the circumstances of the study, which was conducted in a 
challenging situation for the health care system, this is acceptable. 
Since the safety profile in hospitalised patients was expected to be complex and dynamic due the 
COVID-19 disease, which affects multiple organ systems and exacerbates concurrent clinical conditions 
considered risk factors for severe COVID-19, a targeted safety data collection was performed in study 
COV-2066, collecting relevant TEAEs in order to reduce background noise. This approach is acceptable. 
RECOVERY 
Adverse events 
Collection of safety parameters was focused on suspected serious adverse reactions (SSARs) (which 
are those events that, based on a single case likely with a reasonable probability to be related to the 
Page 161/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
study medication) and infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions, which were collected only in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group and not the usual care group since no placebo comparator IV infusion 
was given. The reported events were consistent with IRRs or hypersensitivity reactions (identified risks 
of casirivimab+imdevimab treatment) or associated with COVID-19 and its complication. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Mortality at 28 days was the primary efficacy endpoint of the RECOVERY study. 
Early safety outcome data were recorded within 72 hours (based on the ESAF) after randomization for 
the first 1792 casirivimab+imdevimab participants and the first 1715 usual care participants. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between the casirivimab+imdevimab group and the 
usual care group among all randomized participants. A few imbalances in specific targeted safety 
outcomes were observed; these were consistent with advanced COVID-19 and its complications. 
IRRs were collected for the casirivimab+imdevimab group and not for the usual care group (as 
treatment did not include infusion). 
An online follow-up form was completed by site staff when participants were discharged, had died, or 
at 28 days after randomization, whichever occurred first to provide additional safety information. 
Selected safety data (all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality, major cardiac arrhythmia and 
thrombosis and major bleeding) were collected and analysed for 4839 participants randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab and 4946 participants randomized to usual care. The events reported are 
consistent with advanced COVID-19 and its complications and worsening comorbid clinical conditions of 
hospitalized patients. 
Age, gender and ethnicity 
72-hour safety outcomes defined as sudden worsening in respiratory status, severe allergic reaction, 
temperature > 39°C or > 2°C rise above baseline, sudden hypotension, clinical haemolysis and 
thrombotic event, were summarised by subgroups i.e., age, gender and ethnicity among all 
randomised participants treated with casirivimab+imdevimab in the early safety population. 
The number of subjects who were <18 years was too low in both the casirivimab+imdevimab group 
and the usual care group to allow for any meaningful comparisons or conclusions to be drawn. 
However, although the data is limited in this patient group as casirivimab and imdevimab are directed 
towards an exogenous target, no difference in safety profile is expected between this population and 
patients ≥18 years.  
An imbalance with a slightly higher incidence of events in the >65-year age group as compared to the 
> 18 to <65 year age group for some safety outcomes was observed. A similar trend was observed in 
the usual care group.  
Regarding gender and ethnicity, there were slight imbalances in safety outcomes, but these were also 
observed with the usual care group. 
Overall, no specific pattern or trend for concern was observed in casirivimab+imdevimab group for 
age, gender and/or ethnicity. 
COV-2066 
The Safety population (SAF) included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the 
study drug. Analysis of the Safety population was done according to the treatment received (as 
treated). 
The proportion of participants reporting TEAEs was similar in casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg 
(25.8%), 8000 mg (27.4%) and the placebo group (28.6%). The most frequently reported event 
preferred terms (PTs) (>2%) which were higher for any casirivimab+imdevimab dose compared to 
placebo were: acute respiratory failure (2400mg: 3.5%; 8000mg: 2.3%; placebo: 3.3%) and COVID-
19 (2400mg: 2.4%; 8000mg: 4.5%; placebo: 4.1%).  
Page 162/173 
 
  
 
 
 
A total of 17% (378/2203 participants) of all participants had at least one Grade 3 or 4 TEAE. A higher 
percentage of participants in the placebo group experienced Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (19.0%), compared to 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg (15.1%) and the 8000 mg dose group (17.3%). 
A higher proportion of participants in the placebo group experienced treatment-emergent SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to death, compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab groups (combined and individual 
doses). 
A post-hoc pooled safety analysis across all cohorts and all phases showed that 25.5 (561/2203) of all 
participants had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE. The frequency of treatment-emergent SAEs was 
higher in the placebo group (27.8% [203/730 participants]) compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab 
2400 mg dose group (23.9% [177/740 participants]), the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose 
group (24.7% [181/733 participants]), and the combined doses (24.3% [358/1473 participants]). The 
treatment-emergent SAEs reported are consistent with advanced and progressive COVID-19 disease, 
its complications, or worsening of participants’ concurrent medical conditions due to COVID-19. 
Treatment-emergent AESIs (serious and non-serious) were defined as: Grade ≥ 2 IRRs through Day 4 
or Grade ≥ 2 hypersensitivity reactions through Day 29. The pooled safety analysis across all cohorts 
and all phases showed that 2.0% (45/2203) of all participants experienced at least 1 treatment 
emergent AESI. More participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab dose groups (2400 mg: 2.2%; 8000 
mg: 2.9%) had at least 1 treatment emergent AESI, compared to the placebo group (1.1%). The 
numbers were low and consistent with the expected safety profile. 
Phase 2 enrolment of Cohort 2 and 3 was paused per iDMC recommendation due to an observed 
imbalance of deaths in the treatment groups compared to placebo. The Sponsor conducted a thorough 
assessment of these deaths and it was determined not to be treatment related but considered 
primarily due to worsening COVID-19 disease and participants’ concurrent medical conditions. 
Among the pooled phases and cohorts, TEAEs leading to infusion discontinuation, to infusion 
interruption or to withdrawal from the study were uncommon. 
Age, gender and ethnicity 
TEAEs, TESAEs and TE AESIs were summarised by subgroups i.e., age, gender and ethnicity among 
pooled phases and cohorts (FAS) in the 2400 mg dose group and 8000 mg dose group. The overall 
safety profile of casirivimab+imdevimab was comparable across all groups. 
Post marketing experience 
The post marketing data do not reveal new safety signals.  
Data from 171 pregnant patients were available from clinical studies that allowed enrolment of 
pregnant women. There were 16 SAEs reported in patients receiving casirivimab+imdevimab; none of 
the SAEs were considered related to Ronapreve. No safety new concerns in pregnant women were 
observed 
2.5.2.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The events were either due to COVID-19/COVID-19 progression or worsening of the patients’ 
concurrent/background clinical condition, or in line with the known safety profile of Ronapreve. No 
dose dependency of the events was observed.  
No new signals/safety concerns were identified.

3.   Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.   Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  
Disease or condition 
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or it may cause a wide spectrum of illness, ranging 
from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and 
multiple organ failure (Wiersinga et al. 2020). Mortality in the most severe subgroup (i.e., those 
requiring mechanical ventilation) is reported to be as high as 40-50% when health care systems are 
overwhelmed (Wiersinga et al. 2020; Gray et al, 2021). 
The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit relatively mild symptoms or are 
asymptomatic (Hu, 2020; Oran et al. 2020), especially considering the widespread vaccination efforts 
and high efficacy of currently available vaccines, suggesting that most cases can be managed in an 
outpatient setting. However, vaccines are not 100% effective and there have been reports of 
breakthrough infections that result in hospitalization. Although it is expected that the majority of 
breakthrough infections are likely to be mild to moderate, those considered high risk or those coming 
to the end of their vaccine immunity remain susceptible to severe disease. Furthermore, those that 
choose not to be vaccinated remain at risk with higher levels of morbidity and mortality. 
Approximately 15% of COVID-19 patients develop severe symptoms characterized by the same clinical 
signs of mild to moderate COVID-19 and with one of the following: respiratory rate (≥30 
breaths/minute); severe respiratory distress; or hypoxia requiring hospitalization and oxygen support 
(WHO 2020a) (Cascella et al. 2021). In approximately 5% of infected patients, the severe form of 
interstitial alveolar damage may rapidly progress to critical manifestations of the disease characterized 
by respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that necessitates mechanical 
ventilation and support in an ICU. Complications include sepsis, septic shock and/or multi-organ failure 
including acute kidney and cardiac injury, and even death (WHO 2020a).  
Studies among hospitalized patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby et al.2020) (Westblade et al. 2020). 
Community-based studies in non-hospitalized patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral 
load across both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung et al. 2021).). 
SARS-CoV-2 variants of the S protein have continued to emerge, with variants of concern including the 
Alpha (B.1.1.7 lineage/United Kingdom origin), Beta (B.1.351/South Africa origin), Gamma (P.1/Brazil 
origin), Delta (B.1.617.2/India origin) variants and, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. Irrespective of 
the country of initial reporting, these variants have driven waves of infection globally and are currently 
present in many countries, areas, or territories. These variants have led to significant changes in the 
virus and disease characteristics, such as increased transmissibility and/or virulence, and/or decreased 
effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics. They continue to present a challenge for treatment and 
prophylaxis against the disease. 
3.1.2.  
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Remdesivir (Veklury) is approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in the EU for adults and adolescents 
(≥12 years old and weighing ≥40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low or high flow 
oxygen or other non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment). Other treatments include Kineret but 
only in adult patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low or high flow) who are at risk 
of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma concentration of suPAR ≥6 ng/mL. 
RoActemra is indicated in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental 
oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Finally, dexamathesone has been shown to be efficacious in those 
receiving oxygen alone or invasive mechanical ventilation via the RECOVERY trial and has since been 
implemented in multiple national guidelines for hospitalized patients. 
Page 166/173 
 
  
 
 
 
Despite these approvals, there remains a significant unmet medical need for COVID-19 treatments in 
hospitalized patients. A broad hospitalized population, including adult and adolescent patients, could 
benefit from treatment with a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab.  
Additionally, emerging viral variants pose a very real threat to natural and vaccine immunity and 
therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the need to have as many treatment options available as possible. 
3.1.3.  
Main clinical studies 
RECOVERY is an investigator-initiated, individually randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial in 
which several treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The 
multicenter study was conducted in the UK, Indonesia, and Nepal, with 127 hospitals in the UK taking 
part in the evaluation of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
COV-2066 was an adaptive Phase 1/2/3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to 
exclude futility (Phase 1/2) and evaluate efficacy and safety (Phase 3) of casirivimab+imdevimab in 
hospitalised adult and adolescent patients with COVID-19. The study was the first-in-human clinical 
trial for the combination mAb therapy product (casirivimab and imdevimab).

3.2.   Favourable effects 
Main results from the studies:  
RECOVERY  
28-day all-cause mortality 
●  All randomized participants (including those who were seronegative, seropositive and 
serostatus unknown): 20% (944/4839 participants) of participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group died versus 21% (1026/4946 participants) of participants in the 
usual care alone group (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03; p=0.17) 
●  Participants seronegative at baseline: 24 % (396/1633 participants) died in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group vs. 30% (451/1520 participants) in the usual care group (rate 
ratio: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70–0·91; p=0.001) 
COV-2066 
Mortality by day 29 
●  Overall population (i.e., regardless of baseline serostatus) who were treated with 
casirivimab+imdevimab compared to placebo showed a relative risk reduction in mortality by 
day 29 (7.3% vs. 11.5%; relative risk reduction (RRR): 35.9%; 95% CI: 7.3%, 55.7%). 
●  Seronegative participants with casirivimab+imdevimab treatment compared to placebo showed 
a relative risk reduction in mortality by day 29 (6.7% vs. 15%; relative risk reduction: 55.6%; 
95% CI: 24.2%, 74.0%). 
Discharged from hospital alive 
RECOVERY 
●  Seronegative participants with casirivimab+imdevimab treatment compared to those receiving 
usual care alone showed significant results with regard to this item (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 
1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30).  The additional benefit with casirivimab+imdevimab was no longer 
observed in all randomized participants or in seropositive participants.  
COV-2066 
●  Seronegative with casirivimab+imdevimab compared to placebo showed significant RRR with 
regard to this item (discharged from hospital alive) (90% vs. 81.3%; relative risk reduction: -
10.8%; 95% CI -20.2%,-2.0%). 
Page 168/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
● 
In the case of the overall population when casirivimab+imdevimab was compared to placebo 
the RRR was -5.8% (88.8% vs. 84%; relative risk reduction: -5.8%; 95%: CI -11.1%, -0.6%). 
Seropositive participants had no additional benefit of being discharged alive from hospital with 
casirivimab+imdevimab.  
3.3.   Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
RECOVERY is an ongoing investigator-initiated adaptive randomised controlled, open-label platform 
trial with a factorial design in which several treatments are compared with control (not receiving the 
treatment) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, to investigate their effect on 28-day mortality. The 
primary analysis of the REGN-COV-2 part of this open-label study was initially planned to be conducted 
in all randomized subjects, but was restricted to seronegatives in a very late amendment to the SAP 
(i.e. one day prior to closure of enrolment and several weeks after the decision to stop enrolment was 
made by the trial steering committee. At the time of this decision, the DMC had conducted several 
interim analyses and results from previous comparisons of other treatments in this study were already 
known. Some of these comparisons included subjects who were also included in the REGN-COV-2 vs 
control comparison due to the factorial design. 
The mortality related outcomes reached statistical significance only in seronegative participants, while 
a slightly higher mortality in seropositive participants (16% vs 15%) was observed. The majority of the 
patients in the trial received some form of oxygen therapy. No strong heterogeneity was observed in 
the treatment effect across the different subgroups of respiratory status.  
Moreover, 14% of study participants had an unclear serostatus.  
COV-2066 was prematurely terminated and only after the decision to terminate the study, the protocol 
specified that the exploratory phase 2 cohort 1A and the confirmatory phase 3 cohort 1 would be 
pooled.  
Although the primary virological endpoints were met, the primary clinical endpoint was not met. 
The data are considered exploratory. 
3.4.   Unfavourable effects 
RECOVERY 
Five participants across both treatment groups (4/1792 participants in the ESAF randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab and 1/1715 participants in the ESAF randomized to usual care) experienced a 
severe allergic reaction. 
Twenty (1.1%) participants had an IRR.  
COV-2066 
32 participants experienced AESIs of Grade ≥2 IRRs through Day 4. A higher proportion of participants 
experienced Grade ≥2 IRRs in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (2.0%) and 2400 mg 
dose group (1.5%) compared to the placebo group (0.8%). 
Overall, 14 participants experienced AESIs of Grade > 2 hypersensitivity, through Day 29. A higher 
proportion of participants experienced Grade > 2 hypersensitivity reactions in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group (1.0%) and 2400 mg dose group (0.7%) compared to 
the placebo group (0.3%). 
Post-marketing  
A total of 452 cases (575 events) of hypersensitivity were identified as having PTs falling within 
Hypersensitivity SMQ (narrow). 
A total of 36 cases involving lack of efficacy were reported. 
Page 169/173 
 
  
 
 
 
3.5.   Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data collection addresses in RECOVERY deviated from traditional safety data collection. It 
was aimed to balance safety data collection with practical considerations to ensure that only key safety 
outcomes were captured. Given the circumstances of the study, which was conducted in a challenging 
situation for the health care system, this is acceptable. 
Since the safety profile in hospitalised patients was expected to be complex and dynamic due the 
COVID-19 disease, which affects multiple organ systems and exacerbates concurrent clinical conditions 
considered risk factors for severe COVID-19, a targeted safety data collection was performed in study 
COV-2066, collecting relevant TEAEs in order to reduce background noise. 
The reasons to restrict the collection of safety data is understandable. However, the safety profile in 
the fragile population cannot be fully established.

3.7.   Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In hospitalised seronegative patients, a benefit regarding 28-day all-cause mortality and discharged 
from hospital alive by day 28 was observed in RECOVERY. In seropositive patients and in the overall 
population such a benefit was not seen, even slightly higher mortality in seropositive participants (16% 
vs 15%) was observed. 
In COV-2066-point estimates in the seronegative subgroup are directionally consistent with point in 
the same direction as the results observed in RECOVERY, although of different magnitude.  
The reduction in mortality related outcomes is clinically meaningful. 
However due to the methodological uncertainties as discussed in the report, the RECOVERY data are 
not as robust as usually expected for a confirmatory trial. Data of COV-2066 cannot be considered 
confirmatory as well, however the data are considered supportive. 
Page 171/173 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beside a low number of IRR, the safety events were either due to COVID-19/COVID-19 progression or 
worsening of the patients’ concurrent/background clinical condition, or in line with the known safety 
profile of Ronapreve. No dose dependency of the events was observed. 
The post-marketing did not reveal new signals/safety concerns. 
3.7.2.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data show a clinical benefit in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients i.e., seronegative COVID-
19 patients that were hospitalised. Given the main disease manifestation of COVID-19, it is likely that 
patients were hospitalised because of respiratory distress as indicated by the need for oxygen 
supplementation in the majority of patients.  
In response to the CHMP comments, the MAH provided a revised proposal for the indication restricting 
to patients on supplemental oxygen that are either seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 or moderately to 
severely immunocompromised. The MAH provided of number of arguments to support the view that 
restricting the indication to seronegative patients may not capture all patients that may benefit from 
therapy. While some of the arguments may indeed be correct (e.g., seropositivity does not reflect 
neutralizing capacity, changes in epidemiology) there are no convincing data within RECOVERY to 
support this view and therefore the indication should reflect the recruited patient population to the 
extent possible. 
As regards the argument to alternatively (instead of SARS-CoV-2 serostatus) include patients that are 
immunocompromised there are not data from the RECOVERY trial to support this view. Data from 
COV-2066 show a trend for reduced death/mechanical ventilation in immunocompromised but this is 
not surprising as immunocompromise was associated with seronegativity in the trial.  
The initially proposed qualifier of “hospitalisation” was removed from the indication following the CHMP 
comments. While hospitalisation was an inclusion criterion for RECOVERY it is an ambiguous 
characterisation of eligible patients considering medical practice in Europe overall. 
The majority of patients in RECOVERY had respiratory compromise and therefore oxygen 
supplementation (and more intensive respiratory support) is a good reflection of the patient population 
in addition to SARS-CoV-2 seronegativity.  
The MAH has proposed a posology that increases the dose with perceived increasing severity of 
COVID-19. Even though the justification for the high dose of 8000 mg is not convincing it is most 
sensible to use the dose employed in RECOVERY for the new indication since the data from RECOVERY 
are the basis for the application. While the effort by the MAH to propose differential dosing across the 
disease spectrum/severity is acknowledged, a posology that is not backed by the data from the 
RECOVERY trial was not accepted. Currently it is not clear what distinguishes the small subgroup from 
RECOVERY that did not require supplemental oxygen from the already approved treatment population 
that would justify a different posology and therefore a specific posology based on a baseline 
characteristic “hospitalisation” was not agreed. In summary, one posology for patients on 
supplemental oxygen would be acceptable. The SmPC is updated accordingly.  
The safety profile is favourable.

4.   Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Type 
Type II 
Annexes 
affected 
I, IIIA and 
IIIB 
Extension of indication to include treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older weighing at least 40 kg and receiving supplemental oxygen, who have a negative SARS-CoV-2 
antibody test result for Ronapreve; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 
of the SmPC are updated.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
The MAH submitted at the start of the procedure a request for consideration that the new indication 
brings significant benefit in comparison to existing therapies in accordance with Article 14(11) of 
Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. During the 
assessment, the CHMP raised questions concerning the significant benefit. Prior to the adoption of the 
CHMP opinion, the company withdrew its request for additional market protection. As a result of the 
MAH withdrawal of this ancillary request, no opinion on the additional market protection is adopted by 
CHMP.  
5.   EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

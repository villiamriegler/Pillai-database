1.  Information on the procedure 
Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medicinal products are widely used in the treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), as a mono-component or in combination with a long-acting beta2 
adrenergic agonist (LABA).  
ICS-containing treatments are known to increase the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. This signal 
was first identified in the TORCH study (Calverley et al., 2007) a large clinical study of 3 years 
treatment duration comparing the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination with its component 
parts and placebo in COPD patients. Since other products containing ICS have been subject to review, 
and it was considered that data on the risk of pneumonia with these products in the COPD population 
should be reviewed altogether, so that the risk of pneumonia in this patient population could be further 
characterised.  
On 27 April 2015 the European Commission therefore triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the impact of 
the above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of ICS containing medicinal products indicated in the 
treatment of COPD and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
COPD is characterised by persistent, usually progressive, airflow limitation associated with an 
enhanced inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs. Exacerbations and comorbidities 
contribute to the overall severity in individual patients [Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD), 2015]. Symptoms of COPD include dyspnoea, chronic cough and chronic sputum production. 
Episodes of acute worsening of these symptoms (exacerbations) often occur. 
ICS medicinal products are widely used in the treatment of COPD, as a mono-component or in 
combination with a LABA. The therapeutic effect of inhaled corticosteroids is considered to be the result 
of suppression of airway inflammation (Martinez et al 2013, Martinez and Vercelli 2013), but the 
airway effects of ICS in COPD are complex and the mechanism of action is not completely understood 
(Finney et al., 2014, Jen et al., 2012). However ICSs are an important therapeutic option for certain 
patient groups as established in some treatment guidelines (GOLD report, 2015).  
ICS-containing products authorised across the EU for the treatment of COPD includes the active 
substances beclomethasone, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, budesonide and flunisolide. All 
these products are restricted to ‘prescription only’ status. Estimates based on the data provided 
suggest a patient exposure in the tens of millions across ICS as a class. 
Whilst the majority of the products have been authorised through national procedures, some have 
been authorised through centralised procedure. These include BiResp Spiromax, Budesonide 
Formoterol Teva, DuoResp Spiromax, Relvar Ellipta, Revinty Ellipta and Vylaer Spiromax. 
2.2.  Risk of pneumonia with ICS containing products in COPD patients  
Several potential explanations have been proposed for the mechanisms by which ICS may induce an 
increased pneumonia risk in COPD patients. However the evidence is limited and mainly founded on 
speculative theoretical mechanisms. No biological mechanism has been conclusively demonstrated by

studies to date which largely involved in vitro or animal studies with limited generalisability to clinical 
populations of patients with COPD. This is also complicated by the underlying disease process itself 
which is complex and carries its own risks of pneumonia comorbidity.  
Increasing age is a predisposing factor for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Mullerova et al., 
2012), as are severity of the underlying disease and low body mass index (BMI). Lifestyle factors 
associated with an increased risk of CAP include smoking, alcohol abuse, living in large households, 
having regular contact with children and poor dental hygiene. The presence of comorbid conditions, 
including chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease, 
epilepsy, dementia, dysphagia, HIV and immunocompromised states or chronic renal or liver disease 
increases the risk of CAP by twofold to fourfold (Torres et al., 2013). Moderate and severe lung disease 
(percentage predicted FEV1: 50–80%) and moderate to severe COPD exacerbations have also been 
identified as independent risk factors for CAP in patients with COPD (Mullerova et al., 2012). 
Since the results of the TORCH study that revealed an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of ICS 
in patients with COPD have been published in 2007, a number of large meta-analyses of pooled data 
have been conducted. As part of this review, marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) were asked to 
provide all available data on the risk of pneumonia with their ICS-containing products in COPD patients 
and to comment on the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of their products.  
This report discusses the main clinical evidence, from both randomised controlled trials and 
observational studies. 
2.2.1.  Randomised controlled clinical trials 
Several meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials (RCT) have been conducted in attempt to estimate 
the effect of ICS on pneumonia incidence rates. These are summarised in the below table.

Since the results of the TORCH study were published in 2007 a number of large meta-analyses of 
pooled data have been conducted. All have found an association between ICS as a class and an 
increased risk of pneumonia in COPD patients.  
The three year TORCH study tends to dominate these meta-analyses; for example in the analysis of 
pneumonia data from 14 RCTs by Nannini et al. (2013a) exclusion of TORCH data caused the finding of 
increased pneumonia risk in the ICS group to lose statistical significance. A number of common 
criticisms can be levelled at the studies included in these meta-analyses, including difficulties with the 
accurate identification of pneumonia (particularly pre-TORCH studies), variations in participant 
populations and comparators, and differential withdrawal rates. Many trials were not specifically 
powered to detect pneumonia.  
The most recent and most important of the Cochrane meta-analyses for the purposes of this 
assessment is that of Kew & Seniukovich (2014) who specifically focused on the effect of ICS on the 
risk of pneumonia in COPD. This meta-analysis included parallel-group randomised controlled trials of 
at least 12 weeks duration which compared budesonide or fluticasone versus placebo, or either ICS in 
combination with a LABA versus the same LABA as monotherapy. Forty three studies met the inclusion 
criteria, with more evidence for fluticasone (26 studies; n = 21,247) than for budesonide (17 studies; 
n = 10,150). Mean duration weighted by sample size was 18 months for fluticasone studies and 14 
months for budesonide studies. Studies of both fluticasone propionate and furoate were included. Two 
of the included budesonide studies reported no data that could be used in the analyses and are not 
included in these numbers. Evidence from the budesonide studies was more inconsistent and less 
precise. No studies directly comparing fluticasone with budesonide met the inclusion criteria. 
Fluticasone increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events (requiring hospital admission) (OR 
1.78; 95% CI 1.50-2.12; n = 19,504). No evidence suggested that this outcome was reduced by 
delivering it in combination with salmeterol or vilanterol or that different doses, trial duration or 
baseline severity significantly affected the estimate. Budesonide also increased non-fatal serious 
adverse pneumonia events compared with placebo, but the effect was less precise and was based on 
shorter trials (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.00-2.62; n = 6,472). In a pooled analysis of both fluticasone and 
budesonide data, the OR for non-fatal pneumonia SAEs was 1.76 (95% CI 1.50-2.07). An indirect 
comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy was also conducted and is discussed in 
section 2.2.3 of this report.  
Overall,  a  consistent  association  between  ICS  use  and  pneumonia  is  seen  across  the  meta-analyses, 
with an increased risk of pneumonia of 40 – 70% in patients treated with ICS.

Overall the evidence from observational studies is in agreement with the RCT findings that use of ICS 
predisposes to an increased risk of pneumonia in COPD patients, though there are several conflicting 
studies (Mapel et al 2010, Festic et al 2014, Gershon et al 2014, Lee et al 2013). The studies vary 
widely in many aspects of their methodology including study type, cohort size, patient selection and 
the degree to which confounders such as disease severity were accounted for. A number of studies, 
notably three out of the four conflicting studies presented above (Festic et al 2014, Gershon et al 
Assessment report  
EMA/330021/2016  
Page 10/20 
 
 
 
 
 
2014, Lee et al 2013), considered hospitalisation for pneumonia rather than all pneumonia events. It is 
therefore likely that only the more severe pneumonia events would be captured in these studies.  
Nevertheless, in the majority of studies the estimated increase in the risk of  pneumonia with ICS  fell 
into the range of 40-70% (see summary table above).  
2.2.3.  Intra-class comparison of the risk of pneumonia 
No clinical trials examined directly ICS-containing products head to head and conclusions regarding 
differences in the pneumonia risk with different ICSs have been drawn from indirect comparison in 
meta-analyses/systematic reviews or from observational studies, mostly between fluticasone and 
budesonide.  
The results of these studies were variable, with some suggesting an increased risk of pneumonia with 
fluticasone compared to budesonide (Halpin et al., 2011; Janson et al., 2013; Suissa et al., 2013; Kew 
and Seniukowich, 2014) and others finding no difference (Singh & Loke, 2010; Roberts et al., 2011; 
Nannini et al., 2012; Nannini et al., 2013a; Mapel et al., 2013; Kern et al., 2015).  
Interpretation of data from these studies is complicated by the wide methodological variability, 
particularly in observational studies. For the meta-analyses/systematic reviews, there was generally 
unequal duration and numbers between the budesonide and fluticasone groups - there were generally 
far fewer patients on budesonide. Doses sometimes differed between the studies used, some studies 
assessed these as separate subgroups (Kew & Seniukovich, 2014) but others did not. Studies included 
in the systematic reviews were generally not designed to investigate the risk of pneumonia as a 
primary outcome, were not powered to assess this risk and the treatment groups were not necessarily 
matched or similar.  
The most recent and comprehensive Cochrane meta-analysis by Kew and Seniukovich (2014) found 
non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events were increased by 78% and 62% for fluticasone and 
budesonide respectively. An indirect comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy 
showed no significant difference in pneumonia SAEs. However, in an indirect comparison, the risk of 
any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases treated in the community) was higher with fluticasone 
than with budesonide (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34); this was the only significant difference reported 
between the two drugs. Interestingly, when Calverley et al (2007) (TORCH) was excluded in a 
sensitivity analysis, the difference was larger in magnitude but was much less precise and not 
statistically significant. TORCH was one of the studies with the longest duration and with a relatively 
large number of subjects compared to some of the other studies; this was considered to be a possible 
factor in the relatively high proportion of patients with pneumonia in this study, especially as there is 
no trial of a comparable size or duration with budesonide. It had the largest weighting in all ICS meta-
analyses. As discussed by Kew and Seniukovich (2014), the results from the TORCH study were 
considered to skew event rates, as evidenced by the effect of its exclusion in the sensitivity analysis. 
In response to the questions raised in the context of this referral procedure, a MAH provided a meta-
analysis of 11 clinical trials in which budesonide was administered in COPD patients which found no 
increased risk of pneumonia SAEs with budesonide compared to control overall, although no 
comparison with fluticasone was made. However, a statistically significant increase in pneumonia SAE 
risk was found in certain sub-groups - in particular the subgroups containing studies >12 months 
duration, patients <55 years, and 640 μg dose versus placebo. This latter result is similar to the result 
by dose observed in the Kew and Seniukovich (2014) study. It is to be noted that no statistical 
measure of heterogeneity was presented; in addition, any pneumonia events occurring more than 14 
days after treatment cessation will have been missed in this study design.

Overall, the PRAC therefore concluded that there is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class 
differences in the magnitude of the risk among inhaled corticosteroid products.  
2.2.4.  Influence of the dose and of concomitant medications on the risk of 
pneumonia 
Dose response effect 
In the meta-analysis of eight RCTs (involving studies of FP, budesonide and triamcinolone as either 
monotherapy or combination therapy) by Drummond et al (2008), subgroup analysis revealed that 
there was a significantly higher risk of pneumonia in the subgroup receiving the highest ICS dose 
(>1,000 mcg/day beclomethasone equivalents) (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.10-1.92: p=0.008; I2=78%) but 
not the low dose (<800 mcg/day beclomethasone equivalents) or medium dose (800 – 1,000 mcg/day 
beclomethasone equivalents) subgroups. The high dose sub-group included 4,749 patients versus only 
254 and 402 for the low and medium dose subgroups respectively. 
In their large database case-control study, Suissa et al. (2013) identified a dose dependent increase in 
the risk of serious pneumonia with all ICS ranging from 24% for the lower doses (RR 1.24; 95% CI 
1.13 to 1.36) to 86% with the highest doses of ICS, equivalent to fluticasone 1,000 mcg per day or 
more (RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.77 to 1.94). The dose response was considered to be particularly associated 
with fluticasone, with doses of 1,000 μg of fluticasone per day associated with a 122% increase in risk, 
however no statistical significance was seen between the low and medium doses. No dose–response 
effect was identified with budesonide. The findings were similar to those of the previous nested case-
control study by Ernst et al (2007), which used the same health database. 
ICS use was also associated with a dose-related increase in risk of pneumonia in the retrospective 
cohort analysis by Yawn et al (2013) with adjusted hazard ratios versus no use (95% confidence 
interval) of 1.38 (1.27–1.49) for low-dose users, 1.69 (1.52–1.88) for medium-dose users, and 2.57 
(1.98–3.33) for high-dose users (P < 0.01 versus no use and between doses).  
Although the systematic review by Kew and Seniukovich (2014) did not find that different doses of 
fluticasone (500 and 1,000 mcg) had any effect on pneumonia risk, combining all studies and 
organising by fluticasone dose did not reveal significant subgroup differences between doses (I2 = 0%, 
P value 0.90). Higher-dose fluticasone propionate was the most widely studied and hence has the most 
precise estimate, but the pooled effect was not statistically different from the other dose subgroups. 
However, Kew and Seniukovich (2014) concluded that a significant difference between the two 
commonly used doses of budesonide was noted. The 640 mcg dose was associated with a larger effect 
than 320 mcg relative to placebo, however large heterogeneity was noted in the I2 analysis for the 
budesonide studies (subgroup differences: I2 = 74%, P value 0.05).  
A systematic review by Yang et al. (2012) found that in the six long term (duration >6 months) studies 
that reported pneumonia as an adverse event, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group 
compared to placebo. However, a statistically significant association was only found in the studies 
using ICS > 1,000 µg budesonide equivalent/day, whereas there was no statistically significant 
association in the ICS < 1,000 µg budesonide equivalent/day group.  
In the meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials (12,446 subjects) comparing ICS/LABA 
combinations with LABA monotherapy by Rodrigo et al (2009), no dose effect was seen for fluticasone, 
with an increase in the risk of pneumonia with both moderate doses (500 mcg/d; RR, 1.75; 95%CI 
1.16-2.64; I2 30%) and high doses (1,000 mcg/d; RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.32-2.06; I2 22%). No separate 
analysis was performed for budesonide. The study by Cheng et al. (2014) also showed no statistical 
significance in incidence of pneumonia between patients treated with high dose fluticasone propionate,  
Assessment report

An observational retrospective cohort study of 9,893 patients (Janson et al., 2013) did not find a dose-
related response in patients treated with either fluticasone/salmeterol or with budesonide/formeterol 
combinations (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.57; P=0.99). It is noted that there 
were only two thresholds used to discriminate between dosing with the low daily dose equivalent to 
budesonide <640 µg or fluticasone <1,000 µg and the high daily dose above or equal to these 
thresholds, this limits granularity of the analysis as differences with intermediate dosing would have 
been lost and there may have been significant variation in dosing within those two groups.  
Crim et al. (2015) analysed data within identical, replicate, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group 
trials comparing three strengths of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI). 50, 100, or 200 mg of FF 
combined with 25 mg of VI were administered once daily. 3,255 eligible subjects were randomized 
(1:1:1:1) to one of the four treatment regimens for 52 weeks. Crim et al (2015) could not confirm a 
dose related increase in the pneumonia risk associated with FF/VI.  
Finally, in the systematic review conducted by Nannini et al. (2012), the trials using higher dose 
budesonide, BDF 320/9 μg twice daily, showed an increase in the odds of pneumonia that was not 
statistically significant (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.97), and this was similar to the results from trials 
using lower dose budesonide, BDF 160/9 μg twice daily (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.53 to 2.26). For 
fluticasone, studies using a lower dose of ICS, FPS 250/50 μg twice daily instead of 500/50 μg twice 
daily still showed a significant increase in the risk of pneumonia even on the lower dose of fluticasone 
(OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.53). Similarly in the meta-analysis of ICS/LABA versus placebo involving 
19 studies (10400 patients; Nannini et al 2013a) although an increase in the risk of pneumonia was 
noted with combined inhalers compared with placebo treatment (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.36-1.94) no dose 
effect was seen. 
A number of meta-analyses and observational studies have found evidence of a statistically significant 
dose-response effect for ICS as a class or for fluticasone (Drummond et al., 2008, Ernst et al., 2007, 
Suissa et al., 2013, Yawn et al., 2013); others saw a trend which did not reach statistical significance 
(Rodrigo et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2014). On the other hand, other studies by Janson et al (2013), 
Crim et al (2015) and Nannini et al (2012) saw no dose-response effect. The most recent Cochrane 
meta-analysis by Kew and Seniukovich (2014) found no dose-response relationship for fluticasone, but 
did find one for budesonide. There are, as expected, general limitations of these studies which require 
cautious interpretation of the data. Issues such as residual confounding, reliance on retrospective data, 
early departure of the subject from the database used, lack of information about indication of 
prescription, the absence of randomisation, difficulties in stratifying by severity of COPD disease from 
available information on the database and reliance on information from dispensed prescriptions with no 
information on whether the medications were taken or absorbed as prescribed limit the generalisability 
of the data to ICS using COPD patients. As with many studies of pneumonia in COPD, no definitions of 
pneumonia were used in these studies, and mostly relied on information from clinicians. It is also 
noted that although the recommended doses in the SmPCs for these products do not exceed a daily 
fluticasone equivalent dose of 1,000 µg, some studies considered a “high” dose of fluticasone to 
exceed this threshold. The extent of usage of a higher than recommended dose of ICS in clinical 
practice is not known.  
While the concept of a dose-response for pneumonia risk has biological plausibility and there is some 
supportive clinical evidence, this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies. 
Concomitant medications effect 
Although there is a range of medications from different therapeutic classes that may be administered 
in COPD patients along with inhaled corticosteroids, such as beta agonists, the aminophyllines, inhaled 
Assessment report

anticholinergics/muscarinic antagonists and systemic oral corticosteroids, the products assessed in this 
review are considered to be commonly administered with a long acting beta agonist (LABA) either 
separately or as part of a fixed dose combination. 
LABAs have been shown to inhibit inflammatory and immune cell function; this includes inhibition of 
neutrophil activation, neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, neutrophil respiratory burst as well as the 
capacity to release pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages aimed at combatting bacterial 
infection as seen in in vitro studies (Otonello et al., 1996, Johnson & Rennard, 2001). Stimulation of 
β2-adrenoceptors leads to increase of intracellular signalling molecule cAMP (cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate), and cAMP elevation is considered to result in inhibition of macrophage activation, 
including phagocytosis (Aronoff et al., 2005). 
It has been proposed that an ICS/LABA combination can predispose to an increased risk of pneumonia 
compared to either active substance alone.  The mechanism for this is however unclear. Some in vitro 
studies have shown synergistic or additive inhibitory effects on the production of inflammatory 
cytokines and cell adhesion molecules with a combination of LABA and glucocorticosteroids (GCS). This 
has been shown for both fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol (Silvestri et al., 2001, 
Spoelstra et al., 2002). It has also been hypothesised that the combination allows ICS to achieve 
locally high concentrations in the lung, increasing the risk of pneumonia due to their local 
immunosuppressive effects (Rodrigo et al., 2009, Suissa et al., 2007). 
It has also been suggested from in vitro data that there are effects of LABA other than bronchodilation 
which may act against lower respiratory tract infections. Salmeterol at therapeutic doses was shown to 
stimulate cilia and improve ciliary beat function in vitro (Yaghi et al., 2012, Piatti et al., 2005). LABAs 
have also been considered to reduce vascular permeability with a possible reduction in exudation into 
the alveolar space (Proud et al., 1998). However, once again, any potential mechanisms, whether 
protective or predisposing have not been demonstrated in clinical studies.  
There is a paucity of data with regards to the potential effects of other classes of medication prescribed 
for a COPD indication. Studies evaluating the association between LABA/GCS tend to adjust for 
concomitant medications considered to increase the risk of pneumonia such as central nervous system 
medications (i.e. sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and anti-
Parkinson therapy) and immunosuppressant/ disease modifying drugs (Joo et al., 2010). In addition, 
pneumococcal or influenza vaccination may also reduce the risk of developing pneumonia in patients 
with COPD, a factor which does not appear to have been taken into account in observational studies 
(Crim et al., 2015). 
3.  Overall conclusions 
Since the results of the TORCH study were published in 2007, a number of large meta-analyses of 
pooled data have been conducted. Although a number of common criticisms can be levelled at the 
studies included in these meta-analyses, including difficulties with the accurate identification of 
pneumonia (particularly pre-TORCH studies), variations in participant populations and comparators, 
differential withdrawal rates, and trials not specifically powered to detect pneumonia, a consistent 
association between ICS use and increased risk of pneumonia in COPD patients was seen across the 
meta-analyses. Overall the evidence from observational studies was in agreement with the randomised 
clinical trials (RCT) findings and it was therefore considered that the evidence continues to support the 
conclusion that treatment with ICS increases the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients.  
No clinical trials directly examined the risk of pneumonia with ICSs head to head, and only indirect 
comparison in meta-analyses/systematic reviews or from observational studies is available, mainly 
Assessment report

between budesonide and fluticasone. Results from older meta-analyses and from observational studies 
were also variable, with some suggesting an increased risk of pneumonia with fluticasone compared to 
budesonide and others finding no difference. Overall, due to the variability in the clinical data and 
multiple uncertainties with study methodologies, there is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class 
differences in the magnitude of the risk among inhaled corticosteroid products. 
The PRAC therefore concluded that pneumonia (in COPD patients) should be added as a common 
adverse drug reaction in the product information of all ICS-containing products and that for products 
with an existing risk management plan (RMP), “increased risk of pneumonia in COPD patients” should 
be considered an Important Identified Risk.  
It was acknowledged that any risk of pneumonia with ICS should be considered in context, as 
pneumonia is an intrinsic comorbidity to COPD with certain predisposing factors making some COPD 
patients more susceptible to this risk than others. Further, it was recognised that there are difficulties 
associated with the differential diagnosis of pneumonia or an exacerbation of COPD. To mitigate the 
risk of pneumonia, the PRAC considered that a warning should be included in the product information 
for healthcare professionals and patients to remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia 
in patients with COPD, taking into consideration the overlap of the symptoms of pneumonia with those 
of exacerbation of COPD. 
Finally, the PRAC considered the ICS dose-response effect or the influence of LABA and other 
concomitant medications on the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. Some evidence suggests an 
increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose. It is considered mechanistically plausible that 
a higher dose of corticosteroid could cause a greater degree of immunosuppression in the lung and 
lead to a higher risk of pneumonia, but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies. 
It was considered that this should be reflected in the product information. Due to a paucity of data 
regarding the potential effects of other classes of medication prescribed for COPD, no conclusions could 
be drawn regarding the influence of concomitant medications on the risk of pneumonia in COPD 
patients. 
In conclusion, the PRAC considered that the benefit-risk balance of ICS-containing products remained 
favourable, provided the proposed changes to the product information are implemented. 
4.  Risk management 
The PRAC considered that for products with an existing RMP, “increased risk of pneumonia in COPD 
patients” should be considered an Important Identified Risk.  
In addition, the PRAC considered that routine risk minimisation measures in the form of updates to the 
product information would be necessary in order to adequately reflect the risk of pneumonia as a class 
effect of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD, with no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-
class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk among inhaled corticosteroid products. These 
changes include amendments to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Pneumonia (in COPD patients) was added as a common adverse event and a warning was included to 
inform physicians and patients of the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD and 
highlighting the need to remain vigilant considering the overlap of the symptoms of pneumonia with 
those of exacerbation of COPD. 
The package leaflet was amended accordingly.

5.  Grounds for Recommendation 
Whereas 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC resulting from 
pharmacovigilance data for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-containing medicinal products 
indicated in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); 
The PRAC reviewed the data submitted by the marketing authorisation holders in relation to 
the increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD in association with ICS-containing 
medicinal products;  
The PRAC concluded that the evidence provided supports a causal association between the use 
of ICS-containing products and an increased risk of pneumonia in COPD patients; 
The PRAC also concluded that there is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences 
in the magnitude of the risk among ICS-containing products; 
The PRAC considered that some evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with increasing 
steroid dose exists, although this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies; 
The PRAC was of the view that the increased risk of pneumonia should be included in the 
product information of all ICS-containing products indicated in the treatment of COPD, with a 
warning for healthcare professionals and patients to remain vigilant for the possible 
development of pneumonia in patients with COPD, taking into consideration the overlap of the 
symptoms of pneumonia with those of exacerbation of COPD.  
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of ICS-containing 
medicinal products remains favourable in the treatment of COPD subject to the agreed amendments to 
the product information.  
The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations for ICS-containing medicinal products indicated in the treatment of COPD.

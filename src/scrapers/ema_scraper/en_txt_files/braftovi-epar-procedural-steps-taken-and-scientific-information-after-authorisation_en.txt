1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Braftovi in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, by replacing 
the second dose reduction level of 200 mg once daily 
by 225 mg once daily; based on results from 
simulation report (ARRA-CSC-104). In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to introduce an update of 
the user instructions in the Package Leaflet for 
increased clarity.

SmPC new text 
to add drug-drug interaction information with 
rosuvastatin and bupropion based on final results 
from Arm 2 of study ARRAY-818-103. This is a Phase 
1, three-arm, open-label drug-drug interaction study 
in patients with BRAF V600-mutant unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma or other BRAF V600-E and/or 
K-mutant advanced solid tumours. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
In vivo, encorafenib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 
and/or BCRP. Coadministration of encorafenib with 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BCRP substrates (such as 
rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, methotrexate) can result in 
increased concentrations. 
Repeated administration of encorafenib 450 mg once daily 
and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of 
rosuvastatin (a OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP substrate) 
increased rosuvastatin Cmax by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6-
fold indicating a mild inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 
and/or BCRP transporters.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Note: The MAH in the course of the assessment 
withdrew Mektovi (binimetinib) from the applied 
indication. Therefore, the extension of indication only 
concerns the product Braftovi (encorafenib). 
Extension of indication to include encorafenib in 
combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have 
received prior systemic therapy, as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. The RMP version 2.0 is acceptable. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1.

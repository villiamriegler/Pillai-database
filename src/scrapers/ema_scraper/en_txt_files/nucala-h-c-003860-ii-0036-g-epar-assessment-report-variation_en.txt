2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The current application is seeking approval for mepolizumab use in the treatment of patients aged 6 
years and older with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA). 
Mepolizumab is approved as an add on treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma in all EU 
Member states and additional countries globally for this indication. 
Disease or condition 
EGPA, also referred to as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), is a rare systemic vasculitis, predominantly 
affecting small-sized vessels and medium sized arteries and may involve multiple organs including 
lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. It is characterised by asthma, transient 
pulmonary infiltrates, hypereosinophilia and systemic vasculitis. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication for Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA): 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for patients aged 6 years and older with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
The proposed recommended dose of mepolizumab for adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and 
older with EGPA is 300 mg administered once every 4 weeks by three subcutaneous injections into the 
upper arm, thigh, or abdomen.  
For children aged between 6 and 11 years the recommended dose is as follows: 
• Children weighing ≥40 kg: the recommended dose of mepolizumab is 200 mg administered 
subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
• Children weighing <40 kg: the recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered 
subcutaneously once every 4 weeks.

Epidemiology 
Overall, the incidence of EGPA ranges from 0.18 to 4.0 per million person-years. The prevalence 
ranges from 5.3 to 38 per million. The heterogeneity of incidence and prevalence are due to varying 
geographic regions, patient population (e.g., inpatient versus general population), time periods data 
were captured and the different diagnostic criteria used. In a study by Harrold et al, the incidence rate 
of EGPA was reported to be much higher in an asthmatic population than in the general population, 
with an estimated incidence of 64.4 per million. Some studies indicate that the prevalence of EGPA is 
increasing over time, which may be due to an increase in earlier diagnoses and longer survival times. 
EGPA appears to affect men and women in equal proportions, and the mean age of onset or diagnoses 
is between 40 and 55 years. Among adults EGPA is a very rare condition and paediatric EGPA appears 
to be even rarer with ~100 cases identified in the literature (through 2020). Prior to the advent of 
treatment for EGPA, in excess of 50% of patients died within 3 months of diagnosis. Recently, with the 
advance in treatment strategies, patient survival has been reported as 93% to 94% at 1 year and 60% 
to 97% at 5 years.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
In Churg-Strauss Syndrome the mechanism of tissue injury is poorly understood, but the degree of 
blood and tissue eosinophilia appears to be associated with disease pathogenesis (Schnabel, 1999). In 
a series of in-vitro studies it has been shown that circulating levels of IL-5 are increased in patients 
with active CSS, that peripheral blood mononuclear cells are the likely source of elevated plasma IL-5 
in the disease, and that T cell activation is required for increased IL-5 release by PMBCs in CSS 
(Hellmich, 2005; Hellmich, 2003; Kiene, 2001; Shonermarck, 2000). Of particular interest with regard 
to the pathogenesis of CSS and vasculitis is the ability of IL-5 to promote the adhesion of eosinophils 
to vascular endothelium and CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-dependent migration of eosinophils from 
the vasculature (Shahabuddin, 2000). Thus, the elevated production of IL-5 by PMBCs in CSS may be 
relevant pathogenetically not only for eosinophilia, but also for the development of vasculitis by 
promoting transvascular migration and functional activation of eosinophils. 
The accumulation and activation of eosinophils in target tissues is regarded as a crucial step for the 
development of organ damage in EGPA patients. Current understanding of EGPA implies that T-cell-
dependent activated eosinophils further activate T-cells to produce Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4 and 
-13) (Kiene et al, 2001) and also secrete themselves a variety of harmful mediators such as MBP, 
eosinophil cationic protein and EDN (Polzer K et al, 2008). The latter might directly mediate cardiac 
and nerve toxicity in addition to damage caused by granulomatous vasculitis. Besides, recent research 
has shown that there are other pathways involved in EGPA, such as eotaxine-3 and the TH-1-related 
immunological response (Greco et al, 2015). More specifically, eotaxine-3 has demonstrated to exert a 
pivotal role in lymphocyte diapedesis, induced by IL-4 and IL-13, being one potential target mediating 
eosinophilic perivascular infiltrates. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
EGPA, also referred to as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), is a rare systemic vasculitis, predominantly 
affecting small-sized vessels and medium sized arteries and may involve multiple organs including 
lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. 
Most patients have general symptoms such as fever or weight loss but pulmonary manifestations 
represent the core clinical features of CSS. Almost all patients have asthma, with transient and patchy 
pulmonary infiltrates also occurring in up to two-thirds of patients. Other organs or tissues involved in 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 9/142 
 
 
 
the disease include sinuses (75% of patients; either as a manifestation of allergic or of granulomatous 
inflammation), nervous system (e.g., mononeuritis multiplex in up to 76% of patients), skin (50% of 
patients; nodules, papules or vasculitis), heart (10-49%), gastrointestinal tract (33%) and kidney 
(25%) (Keogh, 2006; Holle, 2009; Vaglio, 2012). The clinical manifestations of heart involvement, 
which is associated with a poor prognosis, range from cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, and 
myocardial infarction to valvular and pericardial disease. Renal involvement typically manifests as a 
pauci-immune, focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, whereas 
eosinophilic or granulomatous inflammation of the kidney is a rare finding in CSS. Other organs may 
also be involved in CSS, and the condition is associated with thromboembolic events. In addition to the 
clinical manifestations described above, laboratory abnormalities are also commonly observed. The 
hallmark is leukocytosis with prominent eosinophilia, with many patients having absolute eosinophilic 
counts greater than 1500 cells/mm3. Anaemia of chronic disease is also often present, and 
antineutrophil cystoplasmic antibodies have been observed in approximately 40% of patients (Sinico, 
2005). 
Management 
The current approach to the management of EGPA is based on reduction of active inflammation, 
suppression of the immune response, and treatment of disease-specific and/or treatment-related 
complications. Corticosteroid therapy is the cornerstone therapy for the treatment of both poor- and 
good-prognosis EGPA patients, approved in few EU countries for EGPA. However, use of 
corticosteroids, particularly longer-term, is associated with significant side effects, including weight 
gain, osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia, depression and increased risk of infection, which can limit the 
benefits [Poetker, 2010]. Furthermore, although remission can be achieved in a proportion of patients 
with corticosteroid therapy alone, the addition of more potent immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., 
azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil) to maintain remission is commonly required. For 
poor-prognosis patients, cytotoxic therapy such as cyclophosphamide (CYC) is necessary for induction 
of remission with a switch to less toxic immunosuppressant therapy, e.g., azathioprine or 
methotrexate, for maintenance of remission. While immune-suppressive therapies are often used for 
improved control of EGPA, they are also associated with significant side effects including cytopenia, 
hepatotoxicity, and major infections such as bacterial pneumonias, herpes zoster recurrences, 
opportunistic infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa, mAb), which binds with high 
specificity and affinity to human interleukin 5 (IL-5), the key cytokine responsible for regulation of 
blood and tissue eosinophils. In patients with conditions where eosinophilia plays an important part in 
the disease pathology, a consistent reduction in eosinophil number is observed in association with 
mepolizumab administration, with concomitant clinical improvement.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/156/2/2012/11) was in relation to the pivotal program in EGPA (design 
of pivotal study. 
The scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/156/3/2015/PA/PED/II) was to discuss the paediatric clinical 
development programme including a full extrapolation approach. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 10/142 
 
 
 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. However, new literature has been submitted to support the CRSwNP indications. Most 
references are based on clinical data only and one recent publication (review) from 2018. 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology  
No studies have been performed. An overview has been provided discussing the mechanism of action 
of mepolizumab to inhibit IL-5 signalling, reducing the production and survival of eosinophils and 
thereby a scientific rationale for potential efficacy in the proposed indication. This is adequate. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Being natural proteins, therapeutic antibodies such as mepolizumab, are not excreted unchanged and 
do not give rise to metabolites with potential biological activity. In view of this, guidance on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) specifically 
exempts amino acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a complete environmental assessment 
and, therefore, no further assessment of mepolizumab drug substance has been undertaken. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new studies have been submitted and juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
mepolizumab. The available non-clinical data support administration of mepolizumab to paediatric 
patients from birth. A juvenile toxicity study would not provide additional relevant safety data.   
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a  significant  increase  in  environmental  exposure  further  to  the  use  of  mepolizumab.  Considering  the 
above data, mepolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The weight of evidence from a critical review of non-clinical toxicity data do not raise a concern for new 
indications in proposed dosing regimen and aimed patient population. There are no concerns from the 
non-clinical point of view. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Table 1: Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical program consists primarily of a single Phase III study in adults (MEA115921). Due to the 
low incidence and prevalence of EGPA in the paediatric population, a clinical trial was not considered 
feasible to support the paediatric indication; instead a full extrapolation of the EGPA adult efficacy and 
safety data (i.e., without clinical data in paediatrics with EGPA) to the paediatric population 6 to 17 
years old was undertaken. This strategy was agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). Dose 
recommendations in the paediatric population are based on targeting an exposure in the same range 
to adults, with similar blood eosinophil reduction.  
Mepolizumab  clinical  pharmacology  has  been  investigated  extensively  during  previous  development 
across various eosinophilic indications and was reviewed as part of the initial marketing application for 
severe asthma and subsequent indication/liquid presentation applications.  
Absorption 
Mepolizumab subcutaneous absorption is slow, with an absolute bioavailability of 74 to 80% following 
injection in the arm in adults or in adults/adolescents, a Tmax of 4 to 8 days, and an absorption half-life 
of 1 to 2 days.  
Distribution 
Mepolizumab distributes into a volume of approximately plasma and interstitial space (55 to 85 mL/kg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 12/142 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Mepolizumab is catabolized by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes and does not  undergo target-mediated 
clearance. 
Mepolizumab is eliminated with a systemic clearance of 0.22 L/day (for 70 kg subject; or 3.1 mL/day/kg) 
and has a SC terminal-phase elimination half-life of 16 to 22 days, with two-fold accumulation following 
repeat dosing every four weeks, consistent with the long half-life. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of  mepolizumab are linear,  dose-proportional,  and  time-independent  after  both 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Study MEA11592 
In the pivotal Phase III MEA115921 study, adult patients with EGPA were randomised 1:1 to receive 
either mepolizumab SC 300 mg or placebo SC treatments every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Sparse PK 
samples were collected at relevant inflection points on the concentration-time profile (approximate 
maximum concentration, trough concentration and during the follow-up phase), in order to investigate 
whether mepolizumab PK in adults with EGPA was similar to other eosinophilic conditions. 
The most recent meta-analysis population PK model, which included data from 13 mepolizumab 
studies across various eosinophilic conditions (asthma, hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic 
oesophagitis) was applied directly to the EGPA dataset without modification and without parameter 
estimation. Observations from Study MEA115921 and model predictions were then subjected to 
statistical goodness of fit tests to assess the degree of comparability. 
The effect of prospectively selected covariates on mepolizumab exposure was evaluated graphically 
(PK parameters vs. covariates), and formally by automated linear model fitting using a 
forward/backward approach. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
A total of 136 subjects were enrolled into the study. The PK data from this study were well described 
with the most recent meta-analysis population PK model. No additional covariates beyond the ones 
already included in the model (bodyweight, creatinine clearance and albumin) were identified. 
Goodness of fit plots are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2:, Figure 3:. A Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is 
presented in Figure 4:.

Concordance between the predicted and observed plasma concentrations in the study was evaluated 
using the following goodness of fit tests: Wilcoxon, Ansari-Bradley, Conover and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. 
All tests confirmed that there was no evidence of an absence of model fit at the 5% significance level. 
There was also no evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest that the observations and 
predictions were drawn from different distributions (Figure 5:). It was therefore concluded that the 
model was able to accurately predict mepolizumab plasma concentrations in an EGPA population.

Immunogenicity  
In Study MEA115921, 135 subjects were tested for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies. Two 
subjects in the mepolizumab group had pre-existing ADAs at baseline, but neither had ADAs detected 
post-baseline. Two subjects (1 in each treatment group) had confirmed positive ADAs for at least 1 
visit post-baseline. One was a transient ADA response (mepolizumab group), and the other was a 
persistent ADA response (placebo group), with a decreasing titer. Neither subject was positive for 
neutralising antibodies. The AE profiles for both subjects were unremarkable.  
Mepolizumab plasma concentration-time profiles in ADA positive subjects were similar to ADA negative 
subjects. Of note, one subject who tested positive for ADA, displayed lower concentrations towards the 
end of the study, because the subject withdrew from study treatment after receiving 10 doses (Figure 
6).

Special populations 
No conventional clinical pharmacology studies were conducted due to the nature of the molecule, its 
mechanism of action and elimination pathways. 
Age, race, gender and disease are not covariates of mepolizumab exposure. Dose adjustments in special 
populations other than children (i.e., elderly, renal- and hepatic-impaired subjects) are not required.  
Based on the population PK analysis (Study MEA115921), a slight increase in CL was seen with 
increasing body weight in adults with EGPA (Figure 8). For example, based on the median estimate of 
each category and using >70 to ≤85 kg as the reference, it corresponds to a 16% decrease in CL in 
the ≤70 kg class and a 21% increase in the >85 kg class which is not considered clinically significant. 
Thus, a dose adjustment based on body weight is not warranted in adults with EPGA. 
Figure 8: Box Plot of Systemic Clearance versus Bodyweight 
Paediatric patients 
Dosing recommendations for paediatric patients are based on providing exposure in the same range as 
adults with EGPA.  
Adolescents (12-17 years) 
The recommended mepolizumab dose in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) with EGPA is the same as in 
adults; 300 mg SC every 4 weeks. Since there is considerable bodyweight overlap between 
adolescents (12 to 17 years old) and adults, and given the favourable safety profile in adults at doses 
up to 750 mg IV every 4 weeks and paediatric subjects (2 to 17 years old) at IV doses up to 10 mg/kg 
on 3 occasions, no dose adjustment in this age group is recommended.  
Additional analyses of dosing options for adolescent patients >40 to <70 kg were explored and 
conducted. The monthly adolescent doses tested were 200 mg SC for subjects weighing >40 to <70 kg 
and 300 mg SC for subjects weighing >70 kg. Exposure at these doses were compared with adult

exposure at 300 mg SC monthly by percentage overlap of AUC distributions. The exposure overlap was 
90% (Figure 9, left plot). 
Figure 9: Overlap integral closing simulations 
The conclusion remained unchanged. The 300 mg SC dose was considered most suitable for all 
adolescents, regardless of weight. 
Children (6-11 years) 
Simulations of exposure, measured as AUC(0-inf), were conducted over a wide potential bodyweight 
range in 6 to 11 years old children of 15 to 70 kg and compared to EGPA adult exposure. The PK 
parameter estimates used in the simulations come from the population PK meta-analysis and from the 
paediatric PK/PD study 200363 (Part A) conducted in children 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic 
asthma, in which body weight is incorporated into the population models using allometry.  
The simulated AUC(0-inf) for a dosing regimen of 100 mg SC every 4 weeks is presented in Figure 
10. The calculated RMSE in this scenario was 37.1%.

Figure 13 shows a plot of RMSE for fixed allometric power of 0.75 and weight ranges 15 – 70 kg, 15 – 
<40 kg, and 40 – 70 kg. For the weight range 15 – <40 kg, the optimal dose ratio is 0.45 assuming 
bioavailability is unchanged, and hence a dose ratio, after adjustment for differences in absolute 
bioavailability (100% [for children (study 200363)] vs. 76% [for adults (meta-analysis)]), of 0.34. 
Consequently, a dose of 100 mg is considered optimal. For the weight range 40 – 70 kg, the optimal 
dose ratio is 0.81 and after adjustment for differences in absolute bioavailability 0.62, which means a 
dose of 200 mg would be considered near optimal. The RMSE for these respective optimal doses is 
21% and 12% of the adult target exposure across the bodyweight range 15 – <40 kg and 40 – 70 kg, 
respectively. These values are in good accordance with the simulated value (which used estimated 
values for allometric power in paediatric subjects (0.861) and fixed to 0.75 in adults).

The proposed mepolizumab dosing regimen for children 6 to 11 years old with EGPA is, therefore, 100 
mg SC for weight <40 kg and 200 mg SC for weight ≥40 kg every 4 weeks. The exposure overlap for 
these doses in children (6-11 years) compared to adult exposure is 93% (Figure 9, right plot).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed. The potential for drug-drug interaction is deemed low 
because IL-5 does not signal via hepatocytes.

Analytical methods for the evaluation of Mepolizumab Plasma Concentration   
The measurement of mepolizumab plasma concentrations for clinical study MEA115921 was carried out 
using the same method 111202M01 (version 5) as the method used during the initial MAA procedures 
for the lyophilised and liquid formulations.  
Plasma concentrations of mepolizumab were determined by Alliance Pharma, Inc using the 
aforementioned method. For assay runs to be acceptable, no more than one-third of the QC samples 
could deviate from the nominal concentration by more than 20% with %CV ≤ 20%. In addition, at 
least 50% of the results from each QC concentration had to meet the aforementioned criteria for 
accuracy and precision. There are also additional assay acceptance criteria in place for the calibration 
curve accuracy and precision and study sample precision.  
Analytical method for quantification of total IL-5 (Method M160527V01) 
During MEA115921, a validated electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) method was used to determine the 
concentration of total interleukin-5. The method is a sandwich ELISA where capture antibody is coated 
onto 96-well MSD plates. Standards, quality control (QC) samples, and study samples are added to the 
wells and IL-5 is bound by the immobilised capture antibody. The IL-5 is then detected using a 
biotinylated secondary antibody and reported by streptavidin SULFO-TAG to generate electro-
chemiluminescence signals.  
- Method validation parameters include: specificity (interference from mepolizumab), matrix 
effect/selectivity, prozone effect, dilutional integrity, precision (inter- and intra-), accuracy, stability in 
matrix and upper/lower limit of quantitation. A summary of the method validation is presented below 
in Table 3:

are also additional assay acceptance criteria in place for the calibration curve accuracy and precision. 
Analytical methods for the evaluation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
The measurement of ADA for clinical study MEA115921 was carried out using the electro-
chemiluminescent (ECL) method used during the MAA for the liquid formulation.  
Analytical methods for the evaluation of neutralising antibodies (NAb) 
The measurement of NAb for clinical study MEA115921 was carried out using the electro-
chemiluminescent (ECL) method used for the initial lyophilisate and liquid formulations.  
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 
(IL-5) with high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and 
differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab prevents IL-5 binding 
to the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits IL-5 signalling and its downstream effects, i.e. the 
promotion, growth and survival of eosinophils in blood, sputum and other tissues. 
Mepolizumab produces a sustained, consistent, dose-dependent reduction in blood eosinophil count, 
irrespective of disease, or administration route, with maximum eosinopenia of 90% due to IL-3 and 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) redundancy. 
Primary pharmacology 
Study MEA115921 
Blood eosinophils 
In adult subjects with EGPA from the pivotal Phase III study MEA115921, blood eosinophils were 
markedly reduced at the first post-baseline assessment (Week 4) and remained low for the duration of 
the study (absolute count 38 cells/µL at Week 52) (Figure 14). At the end of the 52-week treatment 
period, subjects treated with mepolizumab had an 83% reduction in blood eosinophil count compared 
with subjects who received placebo (ratio to baseline 0.17, p<0.001). In severe eosinophilic asthma 
the reduction was 84% for the approved dose of 100 mg SC (Study MEA115588).

Figure 14: Ratio Compared to Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Count (Study MEA115921, ITT 
Population) 
Total serum interleukin-5 (IL-5) 
Previously, in adult/adolescent studies in asthmatic patients serum IL-5 was not detectable in most 
subjects at baseline and total IL-5 concentrations were observed to increase during treatment with 
mepolizumab as a result of the formation of mepolizumab-IL-5 complexes, which decreased IL-5 
clearance. 
In the current study, the measured total serum IL-5 began to increase at Week 4 and reached a 
plateau from Week 24 through the remainder of the treatment period. Total serum IL-5 levels in the 
placebo group remained similar to baseline ( 
Figure 15). Analysis of median total serum IL-5 levels showed the difference between mepolizumab 
and placebo was significant (p<0.001) at each post-baseline time point measured.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab does not bind to the hERG channel and QT-mediated pro-arrhythmia due to blockade is 
not a concern with mAbs due to their very high molecular weight. In clinical studies there were no 
adverse effects on cardiac conduction or repolarisation at doses in excess of the proposed marketed 
dose in the various indications. Furthermore, a concentration-response analysis did not show any 
effects of mepolizumab on QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc). A thorough QTc study has not 
therefore been conducted. 
2.3.1.  PK/PD modelling 
A PK/PD analysis was conducted to investigate whether the blood eosinophil response to mepolizumab 
treatment in patients with EGPA was consistent with the response observed in patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 26/142 
 
 
 
 
135 adults with EGPA from the pivotal Phase III study MEA115921 were included in the PKPD dataset. 
Post-hoc individual predicted mepolizumab concentrations were merged with blood eosinophil count 
data before model fitting. 
The most recent meta-analysis population PKPD model was applied directly to the dataset without 
parameter estimation. An additional class of EGPA for the fixed effect of disease on baseline blood 
eosinophil count was, however, added to the model in order to capture more specifically the baseline 
blood eosinophil count in EGPA subjects.  
The impact of covariates on individual parameter estimates was examined graphically and formally 
using a forward/backward approach. No additional covariates beyond that already included in the 
model [baseline blood eosinophil count effect on baseline blood eosinophil count (KRO) and maximum 
effect (Imax)] were identified. 
Goodness of fit plots are shown in

Figure 18: Model Visual Predictive Check (Semi-log plot) 
Concordance between the predicted and observed blood eosinophil counts in the study was evaluated 
using the following goodness of fit tests: Wilcoxon, Ansari-Bradley, Conover and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. 
For both placebo and mepolizumab groups, formal statistical model fit (both location and shape) at the 
5% significance level was not shown. However, based on the following tests; Shapiro-Wilk (location), 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (location), Cramér–von Mises (tails of the distribution) and Anderson-Darling 
(tails of the distribution) for the placebo data and Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov for the 
mepolizumab data, there was no evidence to suggest that the observations and predictions were 
drawn from different distributions at the same significance level (Figure 19 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 30/142 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20). By contrast, for the mepolizumab data, it was not possible to reject the null hypothesis 
that the observations and predictions are drawn from different distributions based on the Cramér–von 
Mises and Anderson-Darling tests (which are tests sensitive to distribution tails). This was attributed to 
the inclusion of imputed data (0.005 in place of 0), digit bias (two significant figures), spikes in 
observed blood eosinophil count, and effects of steroid withdrawal on eosinophil production during the 
taper.

Based on the totality of evidence, including visual predictive checks and statistical inference tests, and 
in the context of a PD endpoint subject to considerable variability, it was concluded that the PKPD 
model was able to appropriately predict the reduction in blood eosinophil count following mepolizumab 
treatment in patients with EGPA. Therefore, the blood eosinophil response to mepolizumab treatment 
in patients with EGPA is considered no different to the response observed in patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study MEA115921: Pivotal Phase III study (PK /PD aspects) 
In Study MEA115921, after mepolizumab SC dose of 300 mg was administered to adult subjects with 
EGPA, mepolizumab PK data were analysed using the most recent meta-analysis population PK model 
without modification and without parameterisation. No additional covariates beyond those already 
included in the model (body weight, creatinine clearance and albumin) were identified. The analysis 
showed that the PK of mepolizumab in adults with EGPA is consistent with that of patients with other 
eosinophilic conditions and confirmed that EGPA disease is not a determinant of mepolizumab 
exposure.  
The immunogenicity results of this study support the low immunogenic potential of mepolizumab, which 
is consistent with other eosinophilic conditions. 
Blood eosinophil count reduction is considered an appropriate biomarker of efficacy/disease control in 
patients with EGPA. The PD of mepolizumab in adult patients with EGPA population showed a marked 
reduction in blood eosinophils early in treatment, which was sustained throughout the study. The 
magnitude of blood eosinophil count reduction in adult patients with EGPA following mepolizumab 
treatment was consistent with that observed in patients with severe asthma. Since mepolizumab binds 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 32/142 
 
 
 
 
to and then neutralizes IL-5, the observed elevations in measured total serum IL-5 are expected in 
treated subjects but are not a sign of increased disease activity, ( i.e., an increase in serum free IL-5), 
but rather confirmation of target engagement and increase in mepolizumab:IL-5 complex formation. 
The most recent meta-analysis population PK/PD model was applied directly to the PK/PD data 
collected from adults with EGPA in study MEA115291, without adjustment except for a fixed effect 
disease parameter for baseline blood eosinophil count to better capture the baseline in subjects with 
EGPA. The GOF plots indicated that, in contrast to PK, the PKPD model did not fit the EGPA data 
particularly well, which was confirmed by the GOF statistical tests. According to the applicant the lack 
of model fit is attributed to the inclusion of imputed data (0.005 in place of 0), digit bias (two 
significant figures), spikes in observed blood eosinophil count, and effects of steroid withdrawal on 
eosinophil production during the taper. On the other hand, the VPC showed that the model predicted 
well the reduction in eosinophil count with mepolizumab treatment. Further, clinical data suggest 
reasonably consistent PD response to mepolizumab in various eosinophilic conditions. Overall, it can be 
agreed that the totality of evidence supports reasonably consistent PD responses with mepolizumab in 
various eosinophilic conditions. 
Extrapolation from adults to children population 
Whilst there are some potential differences in clinical manifestations between adult and paediatric 
onset EGPA, overall clinical manifestations of EGPA appear to be similar between adults and children. 
The therapies currently used to treat EGPA in paediatric patients are similar to those used in adults. In 
addition, there is supportive evidence from severe asthma patients, that mepolizumab efficacy in 
adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population. This would support the validity of extrapolation 
of efficacy in a disease in which eosinophil involvement is pivotal to the pathophysiology of the 
disease, and hence extrapolation for EGPA. The extrapolation of safety data is supported by the 
available safety data for mepolizumab in children and adolescents with other diseases (severe asthma, 
HES and EoE) where data are available. Further, published case reports of paediatric patients with 
EGPA treated with mepolizumab demonstrated clinical benefit without safety concerns. Therefore, 
given the extreme rarity of EGPA in paediatric patients, paediatric dose selection based on matching 
exposure to that known to be effective and safe in adult patients with EGPA is considered acceptable. 
Paediatric dose selection 
The rationale for the proposed mepolizumab dose for adolescents with EGPA (300 mg SC monthly) 
same as the adult population is based comparable body weight and bioavailability in adolescents 
compared to adults. This would also be consistent with the approach followed for the severe asthma 
indication. The applicant conducted however additional analyses of dosing options for adolescent 
patients. The exposure overlap was 90% for adolescents receiving 200 mg (weight 40-70 kg) and 300 
mg (weight >70 kg) SC monthly compared with adults receiving 300 mg SC monthly. The applicant 
also performed a new simulation showing predicted mepolizumab exposure in children, adolescents 
and adults, for all body weight categories and Q4W dosing scenarios, including adult exposure 
following 750 mg IV. The results indicated that at the proposed 300 mg SC Q4W dose, adolescent 
exposure was comparable or slightly higher than adults but well below adult exposure following 750 
mg IV; a dose that was not associated with any safety concerns. Overall, the proposed 300 mg Q4W 
SC dose in adolescents, regardless of weight, has a favourable benefit risk profile because it maximises 
efficacy in this serious disease and no safety issues are anticipated. 
An investigation, based on simulations, was conducted to identify a paediatric dosing regimen for 
children 6-11 years with EGPA that maintains exposure in children as closely as possible to that 
observed in adults at which efficacy was demonstrated. The simulations indicated that the exposure 
overlap between children from 6 to less than 12 years receiving the proposed doses of 100 mg (weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 33/142 
 
 
 
<40 kg) and 200 mg (weight 40-70 kg) SC monthly and adults receiving 300 mg SC monthly was 
93%. It is agreed that it unlikely that there will be additional precision gains by increasing the number 
of weight bands for dosing in children. Given the wide therapeutic index of mepolizumab and the 
severity of this disease, the proposed doses for this age group are considered reasonable by CHMP. 
Further, a new simulation performed by the applicant upon request from CHMP indicated that in 
children aged 6-12 years (15-50 kg), predicted mepolizumab exposure at the intended dose is 
considerably lower than that expected in adults receiving 750 mg IV. As such, the proposed dose 
recommendations for children 6-12 years are considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The dose selection is considered appropriately justified. 
Clinical efficacy 
The clinical program to support the indication for use of mepolizumab in patients with EGPA consists 
primarily of a single Phase III study in adults (MEA115921) entitled ‘A Double-blind, Randomised, 
Placebo-controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Mepolizumab in the Treatment of 
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis in Subjects Receiving Standard of Care Therapy’. The 
study comprised a 52-week study treatment period and an 8-week follow-up period. 
The EGPA clinical program also included a long term access program (LAP). The purpose of the LAP is 
to support the provision of open-label mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible subjects who 
participated in study MEA115921 and who required a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of ≥5 
mg/day for adequate control of their EGPA. The LAP was set up as study MEA116841 and as a 
compassionate use program (CUP), led by the treating physician, in Italy and Spain.  
Due to the low incidence and prevalence of EGPA in the paediatric population, a clinical trial was not 
considered feasible to support the paediatric indication; instead a full extrapolation of the EGPA adult 
efficacy and safety data (i.e., without clinical data in paediatrics with EGPA) to the paediatric 
population 6 to 17 years old was undertaken. 
Dose response study 
Adults  
No dose finding studies were performed for this indication. Study MEA115921 tested a 300 mg SC dose 
of mepolizumab (delivered as three 100 mg SC injections) once every 4 weeks. This dose and dose 
regimen were selected based on the pharmacology of mepolizumab and the results from studies of 
other eosinophilic diseases. 
Studies in severe asthma have demonstrated that a 100 mg SC dose of mepolizumab every 4 weeks, 
corresponding to the dose providing 90% of the maximum effect on blood eosinophils [Pouliquen, 
2015], was efficacious and well tolerated. 
Compared with asthma, patients with EGPA have much higher eosinophil counts at the time of 
diagnosis, which impacts multiple target organs, and there is a potential for significant spikes in blood 
and tissue eosinophils preceding relapse or during OCS taper [Gioffredi, 2014; Katz, 2014]. It was 
therefore considered that a dose that maximised the pharmacological effect and was higher than the 
dose used for severe asthma treatment, would be required in EGPA to confer therapeutic benefit. 
Paediatric population  
The paediatric indication for patients aged 6 to 17 years old is supported by a full extrapolation 
strategy. Dosing recommendations for paediatric subjects are therefore based on providing exposure in 
the same range as adults with EGPA. Bodyweight is the only significant covariate for determining 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 34/142 
 
 
 
mepolizumab exposure, and after adjustment for bodyweight (and bioavailability in children 6 to 11 
years old), age is not a relevant covariate. 
Adolescent IV and SC data collected in the severe asthma Phase III programme showed that 
concentrations in adolescents were consistent with adults and the individual predicted clearance in 
adolescents were within the rest of the study population range, irrespective of administration route. 
The recommended mepolizumab dose is therefore 300 mg SC every 4 weeks in adolescents (12 to 17 
years old) with EGPA, as in adults. This is also consistent with the approach followed in the approved 
severe asthma indication where the same dose as in adults is recommended for adolescents. 
Building on the learnings from the severe asthma indication, to determine a suitable dosing regimen 
for children 6 to 11 years old with EGPA, simulations and analysis in closed form were conducted to 
match as closely as possible EGPA adult exposure. A dosing regimen recommendation of 200 mg SC 
for children 6 to 11 years old with EGPA and bodyweight ≥40 kg and 100 mg SC for bodyweight <40 
kg every 4 weeks is predicted to maintain exposure on average within 26% of adults administered 300 
mg SC.

Methods 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study of 
mepolizumab in subjects with a history of relapsing or refractory EGPA on stable corticosteroid therapy 
with or without concomitant stable immunosuppressant therapy. The study had three consecutive 
periods: screening/run-in period (1-4 weeks), study treatment period (52 weeks), and follow-up period 
(8 weeks).

also required to be on a stable dose of immunosuppressive therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to 
Baseline and for the duration of the study. 
At baseline, 130 subjects were planned for randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg 
mepolizumab or placebo SC every 4 weeks. The final dose of study treatment was given at Week 48 
with completion of the treatment period at Week 52. At this point, subjects entered the follow-up 
period and were monitored for an additional 8 weeks and completed the study at Week 60 (total 
duration of study participation was up to 64 weeks from screening). Where possible, subjects who 
prematurely discontinued study treatment (for any reason) were continued to be followed up as per 
protocol until the end of follow up at Week 60. 
From Week 4 (Visit 4) onwards, the OCS dose could be tapered downwards according to standard of 
care practice. A recommended, but not required, tapering schedule was provided.

Mepolizumab or placebo was administered from identical syringes as three separate injections, thus the 
active treatment was indistinguishable from the placebo. Each mepolizumab syringe contained 100 mg 
for a total dose 300 mg SC. 
OCS Tapering 
The total study treatment duration was 52 weeks. This duration permitted SoC tapering of OCS dose to 
a target of ≤4 mg/day and evaluation of disease control over an extended period, and balanced the need 
to assess the experimental therapy for at least 12 months and the feasibility of retaining subjects in a 
clinical trial over a prolonged period of time. Starting at Week 4, the investigator could taper the subject’s 
OCS  at  his/her  clinical  discretion.  The  protocol  provided  a  recommended,  but  not  required,  schedule 
from Week 4 for gradual tapering of OCS down to 4 mg/day.  
Once  subjects  reached  a  dose  of  4  mg/day,  further  tapering  downwards  could  be  continued  per  the 
investigator's discretion. Upward adjustment in the dose of OCS was permitted within the 0 to 4.0 mg 
range without necessarily being defined as a relapse.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
Permitted Medications 
• 
• 
Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) as long 
as the dosage remained stable from screening to study completion. Reduction in dose for safety 
reasons, with return to the original dose, where possible, was permitted. 
Inhaled and topical steroid use was permitted throughout the study 
Prohibited Medications 
The following medications were not permitted prior to screening or during the study in accordance with 
the following specified washout periods: 
Table 4: Prohibited Medications
In addition, the following medications were prohibited: 
• 
Intravenous or SC corticosteroid therapy: Prohibited during the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 
2). 
•  Cyclophosphamide: Prohibited from baseline onwards. Subjects who received a CYC induction 
regimen could be randomized a minimum of 2 weeks after the last dose of daily oral CYC, or 3 
weeks after the last dose of pulsed IV CYC, if their total WBC was ≥4 x 109/L. 
Immunosuppressive therapy: If initiated or the dose was increased (e.g., in the event of relapse) 
during the treatment period 
• 
•  Other  investigational  agents  (biologic  or  non-biologic):  Any  drug  not  approved  for  sale  in  the 
country in which it was being used. 
•  Acetaminophen: Was not used in patients with acute viral hepatitis.

Definitions 
Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) 
The investigator completed the BVAS form in the eCRF at Screening, Baseline, and every 4 weeks until 
study completion at Week 60 or the EW Visit. The BVAS is a validated, clinician-completed tool used for 
the comprehensive multisystem clinical assessment of disease activity in systemic vasculitis.  
The BVAS form is divided into 9 organ-based systems, with each section including symptoms/signs that 
are typical of that particular organ involvement in systemic vasculitis. The form is designed to record 
features that are attributable to current active vasculitis, after exclusion of other causes such as infection, 
hypertension,  etc.  The  scoring  sheet  records  the  presence  or  absence  of  each  item.  Each  item  is 
weighted, and a maximum total score applied to each system. The total score on all 9 organ systems 
gives an indication of the disease activity of each subject at the time of scoring and reflects the need for 
therapy or increased clinical monitoring. 
Remission 
In this study, two definitions of EGPA remission were investigated: 
1) BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day 
2) BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤7.5 mg/day 
In  defining  EGPA  remission,  asthma  and  sino-nasal  symptoms/signs  related  to  EGPA  activity,  if  not 
specifically scored on the BVAS assessment, were considered to be controlled by virtue of the low OCS 
dose and were therefore not included in the remission definition. 
As  per  BVAS  principles,  in  the  event  a  subject  achieved  remission  (i.e.,  BVAS=0  and  OCS  dose  ≤4 
mg/day) and at a subsequent visit had a BVAS=1 which did not require an increase in OCS dose above 
4 mg/day, or any other significant clinical intervention or investigation, the subject was considered to 
be in continued remission (i.e., this was not considered a relapse). 
Relapse 
An  EGPA  relapse  was  defined  as  worsening  or  persistence  of  active  disease  since  the  last  visit 
characterized by: 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 40/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Active vasculitis (BVAS >0); or 
•  Active  asthma  symptoms  and/or  signs  with  a  corresponding  worsening  in  ACQ-6  score 
(compared with the most recent previous score); or 
•  Active nasal and/or sinus disease, with a corresponding worsening in at least one of the sino-
nasal symptom questions (compared with the most recent previous assessment). 
Warranting: 
•  An  increased  dose  of  corticosteroid  therapy  (including  systemic  corticosteroid  therapy)  to  >4 
mg/day prednisolone total daily dose or equivalent; or 
•  An increased dose or addition of immunosuppressive therapy; or 
•  Hospitalization related to EGPA worsening. 
Subjects  could  have  EGPA  relapses  in  one  or  more  categories  (e.g.,  vasculitis  and/or  asthma  and/or 
sino-nasal), as classified by the investigator. 
A BVAS evaluation was conducted at the time of a relapse, or as soon as possible afterwards. 
The time of onset of a relapse was defined as: 
The time of increase in dose of OCS therapy, and/or 
Increase in dose or addition of immunosuppressive therapy, and/or 
• 
• 
•  Hospitalization, in association with the worsening in BVAS, asthma or sino-nasal symptoms. 
Major Relapse 
A major relapse (a subset of the total relapse events) was defined as: 
•  Any organ or life-threatening EGPA event; or 
•  BVAS  ≥6  (involving  at  least  two  organ  systems  in  addition  to  any  general  symptoms  where 
present [myalgia, arthralgia/arthritis, fever >38ºC, or weight loss >2 kg]); or 
•  An asthma relapse requiring hospitalization; or 
•  Sino-nasal relapse requiring hospitalization. 
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the co-primary efficacy endpoint 1, the total accrued duration of 
remission, i.e., the accrued number of weeks where BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day over the 52 
week treatment period reported as proportion of subjects who achieved remission in the following 
categories: Zero; >0 to <12 weeks; 12 to <24 weeks; 24 to <36 weeks and ≥36 weeks. While this 
endpoint is novel and has not explicitly been used in clinical trials of EGPA before, it was discussed with 
a number of experts in the field and the magnitude of improvement specified below was felt to be 
clinically meaningful. 
A study with 65 subjects randomized to each treatment arm was estimated to have at least 90% 
power to detect a 29% difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved remission for at least 24 
weeks on mepolizumab plus SoC compared with placebo plus SoC at the two sided 5% significance 
level. The power calculation used a test for proportions and assumed that 25% of subjects on placebo 
would achieve accrued remission of at least 24 weeks compared with 54% on mepolizumab. This was 
equivalent to an odds ratio of 3.5. 
While this endpoint is novel, and has not explicitly been used in clinical trials of EGPA before, it was 
discussed with experts in the field and an improvement of this magnitude was felt to be clinically 
meaningful. Additionally, there are few previous data on the duration of accrued remission; however 
the estimate of 25% of subjects receiving placebo achieving ≥24 weeks was felt by clinical experts to 
be reasonable for this population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 41/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the co-primary endpoint 2, the proportion of subjects who were in remission at both Weeks 36 and 
48 of the study treatment period, it was similarly assumed that 25% of subjects receiving placebo 
would achieve remission at both time points, while 54% of subjects treated with mepolizumab would 
achieve remission at both time points. Under these assumptions, the previously described calculations 
for accrued remission were applicable to the second co-primary endpoint. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule which was 
generated using the GSK validated randomization software RandAll NG. The randomisation was stratified 
by: i) subjects in the US participating in the US ‘mechanistic/biomarker’ sub-study (approximately 50 
subjects), ii) subjects recruited in Japan, and iii) the remainder of the recruited subjects. Equal numbers 
of subjects were allocated to each treatment. The randomization schedule was provided to an unblinded 
qualified designee at each site and was used for preparation of the double-blind study treatment. 
Blinding (masking) 
Subcutaneous preparations of mepolizumab and placebo were identical in appearance and were 
administered by a blinded staff member. Investigational product was prepared by a designated 
unblinded person, independent of the study assessments. Blood eosinophil counts were not 
communicated to investigators, in order to maintain the blind. The blinding of those involved in the 
evaluation of the study, i.e., physician/nurse and subject was maintained at all times. 
Statistical methods 
The final analyses were performed after all subjects completed the study as defined in the protocol, all 
required database cleaning activities were completed, and the database was frozen. 
Endpoints 
Estimands 
According to the SAP,  primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population 
and will address a de facto estimand) unless otherwise specified, i.e. analyses will use all data 
observed during the Study Treatment Period i.e. up to and including Visit 17 (Week 52) date, or the 
date of withdrawal from the study, if earlier. For subjects withdrawing prematurely from randomised 
treatment but continuing in the study, efficacy data collected during this period will be included in the 
analysis where this is available. 
Changes in Planned Analyses and Post hoc Analyses 
However in the CSR , it is stated that: For subgroup analyses of co-primary endpoints by region (i.e., 
North America, Europe, Japan), data from centers in Europe (N=65) and Japan (N=6) were combined 
after unblinding because there were insufficient numbers of subjects in each of the regions to conduct 
the planned analyses.  
For subgroup analyses of co-primary endpoints by race (i.e. African American/African Heritage, White, 
Asian, Other), data from subjects with a race of African American/African Heritage (N=0), Asian (N=8) 
and Other (N=3) were combined after unblinding because there were insufficient numbers of subjects 
in each of the race groups to conduct the planned analyses. 
Analysis Populations 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 42/142 
 
 
 
 
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: All subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
study treatment. Randomized subjects were assumed to have received study treatment unless 
definitive evidence to the contrary existed. Treatment group allocations were based on the randomized 
treatment groups. This was the primary population for all analyses of efficacy measures. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: Consisted of all subjects in the ITT Population not identified as protocol 
deviators with respect to criteria considered to impact the primary efficacy analysis. The decision to 
exclude a subject from the PP Population or exclude part of their data from the PP Population analyses 
was made prior to breaking the blind; however, 2 subjects were removed after breaking the blind.  
The PP Population was used for a supplementary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Statistical Analysis of Primary outcomes. 
The primary analysis of co-primary endpoint 1 used a proportional odds regression model for ordered 
categorical data (incremental 12-week durations) for the accrued duration of remission (see RAP 
Section 7). For the proportional odds model, it is unnecessary to assign scores to the response 
categories, and if the model holds for a particular set of response categories, it holds with the same 
effects when the response scale is collapsed in any way. The primary analysis of co-primary endpoint 2 
used a logistic regression model for the proportion of subjects in remission at Weeks 36 and 48. For 
both models, the comparison of mepolizumab with placebo was expressed as an odds ratio and 
associated p-value and 95% confidence limit. 
For the co-primary endpoints, supporting analyses using the PP Population were conducted. 
Statistical Analyses of Secondary Endpoints 
The first secondary endpoint, time to first EGPA relapse, was analyzed using a Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. The hazard ratio was derived along with 95% confidence limits. Cumulative 
event rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The remaining secondary endpoints were 
analyzed similarly to the co-primary endpoints using either a proportional odds regression model or a 
logistic regression model as applicable. For the frequency of EGPA relapses, the percent reduction in 
annual relapse was calculated as (1-rate ratio) x 100. 
Tipping point sensitivity analyses were conducted on primary and secondary endpoints, in order to 
explore the robustness of the trial results to changes in the endpoint definition relating to the 
treatment of missing data. Analyses were also conducted to address a de jure estimand, in which 
subjects discontinuing treatment were defined as not in remission after the date of treatment 
discontinuation.  
Subgroup analyses of time to first EGPA relapse by baseline blood eosinophil count and frequency of 
EGPA relapses by baseline blood eosinophil count were defined post hoc, and used the same methods 
as analyses using the whole ITT Population. 
Analyses of change from baseline BVAS, VDI, ACQ-6, FEV1, FVC, and SNOT-22 were performed using 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). Frequency of all EGPA relapses and major relapses were 
analyzed using a negative binomial generalized linear model with a log link function. Sustained 
remission and proportion of subjects with a percentage reduction in the average OCS dose during 
Weeks 48 to 52 were analysed using a proportional odds model, i.e., as per co-primary endpoint 1. 
Time to first major relapse was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, i.e., as per 
secondary endpoint 1.  
The SAP also states that : When strong control of the overall type I error is required, adjustment for 
multiplicity will be achieved using a closed testing procedure with the secondary endpoints nested

under the primary efficacy endpoint, followed by a further hierarchical procedure within the secondary 
endpoints. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 151 subjects were screened for this study. A total of 136 subjects were randomized, received 
at least one dose of study drug, and were included in the ITT Population. 
The majority of subjects in the ITT Population completed study treatment (90%) and completed the 
study (93%). Of the 14 subjects (10%) that were prematurely discontinued from study treatment, 8 
subjects were also withdrawn from the study and 6 continued participation in the study until Week 52.

Table 5: Subject Disposition (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
Recruitment 
The US had the largest subject enrolment (59 subjects, 43%) followed by Germany (19 subjects, 14%), 
France, Italy, and the UK (13 subjects, 10% each country). Smaller number of subjects were enrolled 
in Canada, Japan (6 subjects, 4% each country), Spain (4 subjects, 3%), and Belgium (3 subjects, 
2%). The number of subjects randomized per center ranged from 1 to 16. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol dated 29 August 2013 was amended three times to all study centers. Amendment 
1 became effective before any subjects were enrolled in the study. Amendment 2 was implemented when 
subject enrolment was underway. Amendment 3 was implemented approximately 2 months before LSLV; 
it did not affect study conduct but required amendment to the planned study analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 45/142 
 
 
 
 
•  Amendment 1 (15 October 2013): Removed evaluation of ACQ-6 and sino-nasal symptoms at 
the time of relapse and clarified the definition of time of onset of relapse. Country-specific 
requirements for Japan regarding hepatitis B screening were also added. 
•  Amendment 2 (27 August 2014): Clarified investigators could taper OCS downward when 
BVAS≠0; included additional statement in risk assessment table; clarified that subjects who 
become pregnant must be withdrawn from study treatment; clarified requirements for 
collection of a fasting blood sample in diabetic subjects; clarified that collection of PK samples 
at Weeks 1 and 29 was optional; deleted requirement for measurement of eosinophil count as 
a liver event follow-up assessment; amended the schedule for sputum sampling in the 
biomarker sub-study; added country specific change for Japan regarding definition of relapsing 
disease in inclusion criteria; included short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) and long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) as bronchodilators to be withheld prior to reversibility testing; 
and clarified requirements for subject follow-up in the event study treatment was discontinued. 
•  Amendment 3 (24 June 2016): Added secondary endpoints including the remission definition 
as per the EULAR recommendations for conducting clinical trials in systemic vasculitis, i.e., 
BVAS=0 and prednisolone/ prednisone dose ≤7.5 mg/day; clarified major relapse definition; 
and amended the statistical data analysis in accordance with the addition of these new 
secondary endpoints. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were cited for 25% and 32% of subjects in the mepolizumab and 
placebo groups, respectively. The most frequent deviation was for errors in assessments and/or 
procedures, which occurred with similar incidence between the treatment groups (18% mepolizumab 
and 19% placebo). Six subjects (9%) in the mepolizumab group and 11 subjects (16%) in the placebo 
group were excluded from the PP Population due to protocol deviations which could potentially impact 
the primary efficacy analyses.

Table 6: Important Protocol Deviations (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
Wrong Treatment or Incorrect Dose 
Eight subjects (4 in the mepolizumab group and 4 in the placebo group) were categorized as receiving 
the wrong treatment or incorrect dose. Six of these subjects were excluded from the PP Population. 
Mepolizumab 300 mg: One subject was randomized to mepolizumab but actually received placebo 
throughout the study in error since the site was sent an incorrect version of the randomization 
schedule. Another subject received the correct dose of mepolizumab at Visit 8/Week 20, but vials from 
another mepolizumab study supply were used instead of vials from the MEA115921 study supply. 
These 2 subjects were excluded from the PP Population. 
Two subjects (both mepolizumab group) each received a dose of study treatment at the last treatment 
period visit (Week 52/Visit 17) in error (no dosing was to occur at this visit). These two subjects were 
included in the PP Population since dosing at this visit did not impact on-treatment assessments. 
Placebo: One subject was randomized to placebo but actually received mepolizumab throughout the 
study in error since the site was sent an incorrect version of the randomization schedule. Two subjects 
received mepolizumab instead of placebo at Week 28/Visit 10 and Week 40/Visit 14, respectively, due 
to a mix-up in reconstitution between placebo and active. One subject received two injections of 
placebo instead of three at Week 44/Visit 15. These 4 subjects were excluded from the PP population. 
Baseline data 
The study population was primarily White (92%) and more than half were female (59%); the mean 
age was 48.5 years. Seventeen subjects (13%) ≥65 years of age participated in the study. Subjects of

Hispanic/Latino ethnicity comprised 3% of the ITT Population. One third (33%) of subjects weighed 
more than 85 kg. Mean and median BMI was >25 kg/m2, indicating some subjects tended to be 
overweight. Demographics were balanced between the treatment groups. 
Table 7: Demographics (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
EGPA History 
EGPA history was generally similar between the treatment groups. The mean EGPA disease duration 
was 5.5 years. Relapsing disease was reported for 74% of subjects and refractory disease for 54% of 
subjects (subjects could have either or both). 
In addition to a history or presence of asthma and eosinophilia, reported EGPA disease characteristics 
for the majority of subjects were sino-nasal abnormality (94%) and/or non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates 
(72%). Neuropathy was reported for 41% of subjects with higher incidence in the mepolizumab group 
(47%) than in the placebo group (35%). 
Forty-one percent of subjects were reported as having had a biopsy which showed histopathological 
evidence of EGPA. Nineteen percent of subjects had a history of a positive ANCA test. 
In the previous 2 years, nearly all subjects (96%) had experienced at least one EGPA relapse; 42% of 
subjects had three or more EGPA relapses. The majority of subjects (77%) had received 
immunosuppressive drug therapy and one-third (34%) had been managed with CYC; 15% of subjects 
had been admitted to an intensive care therapy unit.

Table 8: EGPA History (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
Baseline EGPA Treatment, BVAS, and ACQ-6 Score 
At baseline, the median OCS dose was 12.0 mg/day in the mepolizumab group and 11.0 mg/day in the 
placebo group. The majority of subjects (71%) required a daily OCS dose of >7.5 to ≤20 mg and 15% 
of subjects were taking more than 20 mg/day. More subjects in the mepolizumab group (60%) were 
taking immunosuppressive therapy at baseline compared with the placebo group (46%). The median 
baseline BVAS was lower in the mepolizumab group (1.0) than in the placebo group (2.0). At baseline, 
the majority of subjects (69%) had ACQ-6 scores >0.75 indicating lack of asthma control; 40% had 
scores >1.5.

Table 9: Baseline EGPA Treatment, BVAS, and ACQ-6 Score (Study MEA115921, ITT 
Population) 
At baseline, fewer subjects in the mepolizumab group (54%) were recorded as having active vasculitis 
conditions scored on BVAS compared with the placebo group (71%). 
The most prominent features attributable to current vasculitis were paranasal sinus involvement (43%) 
and wheeze (35%). Bloody nasal discharge/crusts/ulcers/granulomata, sensory peripheral neuropathy, 
myalgia, and arthralgia/arthritis were present in smaller proportions of subjects (14%, 11%, 9% and 
9%, respectively).

Screening and Baseline Lung Function Tests 
Screening lung function tests showed a mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 2496 mL, percent predicted 
FEV1 of 77.52%, and FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.69.  Although there was some small variation, spirometry 
values recorded at baseline were generally similar to screening values. Percent FEV1 reversibility post 
bronchodilator administration was low (11%). Screening and baseline lung function test results were 
comparable between the treatment groups. 
Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications were used during the treatment period by 100% of subjects in the study. 
Respiratory system medications were used by 99% of subjects in the mepolizumab group and 100% of 
subjects in the placebo group. 
Oral Corticosteroid and Immunosuppressive Therapy 
All subjects were taking OCS prior to the treatment period (69% prednisone and 31% 
prednisolone).The most common route of corticosteroids was orally during the treatment period with 
the exception of a few additional non-oral corticosteroid therapies (methylprednisolone, 
dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and triamcinolone) administered for EGPA relapse. 
More subjects in the mepolizumab group were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at baseline and 
during treatment (60% and 62%) compared with the placebo group (46% and 47%). One subject in 
each treatment group started immunosuppressive therapy during treatment (mycophenolic acid in the 
placebo group and methotrexate, allergens [NOS], and atovaquone in the mepolizumab group).

Co-primary endpoints 
Co-primary endpoint: Accrued Duration of Remission 
Primary analysis: Subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a significantly greater accrued time in 
remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) over the 52-week treatment period compared with 
subjects who received placebo (p<0.001).

Analyses of accrued duration of remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) using the PP Population 
produced similar results to the primary analysis using the ITT Population. 
Co-primary endpoint: Proportion of Subjects in Remission at Both Weeks 36 and 48 
Primary analysis: A significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab (32%) 
achieved remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study 
compared with subjects who received placebo (3%), p<0.001.

Analyses of the proportion of subjects who achieved remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) at 
both Weeks 36 and 48 using the PP Population produced similar results to the primary analysis using the 
ITT Population. 
Secondary endpoints  
Proportion of Subjects who Achieved Remission within the First 24 Weeks of the Study and 
Remained in Remission 
A significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab (19%) achieved remission 
(BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) within the first 24 weeks of the study and remained in remission 
for the remainder of the 52-week treatment period compared with subjects receiving placebo (1%), 
p=0.007. 
Remission Definition 2: BVAS=0 and OCS Dose <=7.5 mg/day 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Remission 
With the definition of remission set at a higher threshold for OCS daily dose ( 7.5 mg), 6 subjects (2 
in the placebo group and 4 in the mepolizumab group) were in remission at baseline and 10 subjects 
(6 in the placebo group and 4 in the mepolizumab group) were in remission at Week 4 prior to OCS 
tapering.

After Week 4, investigators were permitted to taper OCS. Starting at Week 8 and through Week 52, 
larger proportions of subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose 
≤7.5 mg/day) compared with subjects treated with placebo. The proportions of subjects achieving 
remission ranged from 22% (Week 8) to 53% (Weeks 24 and 28) with mepolizumab and from 9% 
(Week 8) to 22% (Week 24) with placebo. During the follow-up period after cessation of treatment 
(post Week 52), the proportion of subjects achieving remission in the mepolizumab group declined 
from 38% at Week 52 to 22% at Week 60. 
Accrued Duration of Remission 
Subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a significantly greater accrued time in remission (BVAS=0 
and OCS dose ≤7.5 mg/day) over the 52-week treatment period compared with subjects who received 
placebo (p<0.001).

Table 17: Analysis of Time to First EGPA Relapse (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
Time to First EGPA Relapse by Baseline Blood Eosinophil Count 
There was a significant (p<0.10) interaction of treatment with baseline blood eosinophil count in the 
time to first EGPA relapse. Post hoc analyses were performed to examine the effect of baseline blood 
eosinophil count on time to relapse. 
For subjects who had a baseline blood eosinophil count<0.150 GI/L, the time to first EGPA relapse was 
longer for subjects treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo during the 52-week treatment 
period, although the hazard ratio was higher than the analysis of the whole ITT Population, suggesting 
a reduced treatment effect in this subgroup. 
For subjects who had a baseline blood eosinophil count ≥0.150 GI/L, the treatment effect was 
increased compared with the analysis of the whole ITT Population, suggesting a higher treatment 
effect in this subgroup. 
Major Relapses 
The time to first major relapse was also significantly longer for subjects treated with mepolizumab 
compared with placebo during the 52-week treatment period (p=0.042).

Frequency of Relapses 
All Relapses 
Over the 52-week treatment period, fewer subjects treated with mepolizumab (56%) had EGPA 
relapses compared with subjects who received placebo (82%) and the number of relapse events was 
lower with mepolizumab (88 events) compared with placebo (154 events). Similarly, the incidence and 
number of events in each relapse category as classified by the investigator (vasculitis, asthma, sino-
nasal, and combinations thereof) was lower with mepolizumab compared with placebo. 
During the follow-up period, a slightly larger percentage of subjects previously treated with 
mepolizumab (31%) had EGPA relapses compared with those who previously received placebo (26%), 
primarily due to an increase in the incidence of vasculitis relapses with or without another category 
defined (22% mepolizumab and 9% placebo).

Table 18: EGPA Relapses During the Treatment and Follow-up Periods (Study MEA115921, 
ITT Population) 
Mepolizumab treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of EGPA relapse compared with 
placebo. Over the 52-week treatment period, subjects treated with mepolizumab had a 50% reduction 
in annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving placebo (p<0.001). 
Frequency of EGPA Relapses by Baseline Blood Eosinophil Count 
A post hoc analysis showed that over the 52-week treatment period, subjects treated with 
mepolizumab who had a baseline blood eosinophil count <150 GI/L had an 11% reduction in 
annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving placebo, whereas subjects with a baseline 
blood eosinophil count ≥0.150 GI/L had a 66% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with 
subjects receiving placebo. 
OCS Dose Reduction 
OCS Dose Over Time 
At baseline, the median OCS dose was 12 mg/day in the mepolizumab group and 11 mg/day in the 
placebo group. Investigators were not permitted to taper OCS until the Week 4 visit. Starting at Weeks 
5-8 through Weeks 49-52, the mepolizumab group showed a reduction in median daily OCS dose while 
little change was observed in the placebo group. Median reductions from baseline were greater in the 
mepolizumab group (-1.90 to -7.50 mg/day) compared with the placebo group (-0.11 to -2.50 
mg/day) during the 52-week treatment period. During the follow-up period after cessation of 
treatment (post Week 52), the median OCS daily dose in the mepolizumab group increased from 5.00 
mg/day to 7.79 mg/day.

Over the 52-week treatment period, subjects treated with mepolizumab had greater mean reductions 
(improvement) in SNOT-22 scores compared with subjects who received placebo. 
At Week 52, subjects treated with mepolizumab had a -4.68 unit improvement in SNOT-22 score

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  results  the  primary  endpoint:  Accrued  Duration  of  Remission 
(BVAS=0 and OCS Dose ≤4 mg/day) 
There were no significant interactions (p>0.10) of the following factors with treatment: baseline BVAS, 
region, age group, sex, race, treatment with immunosuppressive drug therapy at baseline, duration of 
EGPA disease, baseline VDI score, BVAS activity at baseline (post-hoc), and weight category (post-
hoc), suggesting that there is no difference in the efficacy of mepolizumab within these subgroups. 
The interaction between baseline blood eosinophil group and treatment group was significant 
(p<0.001). There was a greater accrued time in remission in the mepolizumab group compared with 
placebo, in subjects with a baseline blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/µL. The interaction between 
baseline OCS dose (post-hoc) and treatment group was also significant (p=0.003). There was less 
accrued time in remission in the mepolizumab group compared with placebo, in the small subgroup of 
subjects receiving the highest (>20 mg/day) OCS doses.

subgroups. The interaction between the following subgroups and treatment group were potentially 
significant: 
Baseline OCS dose (post-hoc) (p=0.064). However, the treatment effect could not be estimated in 
subjects taking ≤7.5 mg or >12 to ≤20 mg OCS dose at baseline because there were no subjects in 
remission at Weeks 36 and 48 in the placebo group within these subgroups. In addition, the treatment 
effect could not be estimated in subjects taking ≥20 mg OCS dose at baseline because there were no 
subjects in remission at Weeks 36 and 48 in the mepolizumab group within this subgroup.

Sex (p=0.095). However, the treatment effect could not be estimated in females because there were 
no female subjects in remission at Weeks 36 and 48 in the placebo group within this subgroup. 
Immunosuppressive therapy at baseline (p=0.073). However, the treatment effect could not be 
estimated in subjects with no immunosuppressive therapy at baseline because there were no subjects 
in remission at Weeks 36 and 48 in the placebo group within this subgroup.  
Baseline blood eosinophil count (p=0.016). However, the treatment effect could not be estimated in 
subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL because there were no subjects in remission at 
Weeks 36 and 48 in the placebo group within this subgroup. 
Baseline VDI score (p=0.058). However, the treatment effect could not be estimated in subjects with

Clinical studies in special populations 
Mepolizumab paediatric full extrapolation approach in the EGPA indication 
Background information  
The prevalence of paediatric EGPA is very low, with approximately 100 cases identified in the literature 
worldwide between 1951 and 2020. A clinical programme for paediatric EGPA was not considered 
feasible and, instead, a full extrapolation approach (i.e., extrapolation without any clinical data in the 
paediatric population with EGPA) of the efficacy and safety data from the single pivotal Phase III adult 
EGPA study was proposed, to support a paediatric indication in the 6 to 17 years age group. 
Comparison of childhood-onset to adult-onset EGPA 
There is limited information available to compare childhood- versus adult-onset EGPA. 
The 4 published articles and 1 unpublished analysis by the MAH compared the characteristics of a 
pooled set of patients with childhood-onset EGPA versus adult-onset EGPA reported in published 
literature. 
In the MAH analysis, the paediatric data from published literature were supplemented with individual 
case reports, and these pooled results were analysed by system organ class. This population was 
indirectly compared with a pooled population of adult-onset EGPA patients, also from published 
literature. 
All the patients were required to be diagnosed with EGPA by at least 1 of the 3 standard criteria. Exact 
methods were used to estimate the proportion differences and odds ratios. 
An analysis was conducted to compare the characteristics of a pooled set of patients with childhood-
onset EGPA versus adult-onset EGPA reported in published literature. Overall, there were 87 cases of 
childhood-onset and 205 cases of adult-onset EGPA. The mean age of diagnosis was around 12 years 
in the childhood-onset group and 48 years in the adult-onset group. In general, regardless of the age, 
marked eosinophilia was present across all patients and asthma (≥88%) and sino-nasal involvement 
(≥65%) was frequent in both groups. 
While, overall, the clinical manifestations of EGPA were similar in both groups, the frequency of specific 
events, including mortality, differed between populations. Cardiac involvement was higher in 
childhood-onset (49%) versus adult-onset (26%) EGPA, but pericardial disease was similar between 
the groups. The paediatric patients were less likely to have musculoskeletal, renal or peripheral 
nervous system disease, but more likely to have GI or skin involvement compared with adult patients. 
There were no major differences in other organ involvement between the 2 groups. 
The histological features of EGPA, which were based on tissue biopsies (including extravascular 
eosinophils, vasculitis and granulomas), were more frequent in the childhood-onset EGPA versus adult-

onset EGPA group. The mortality rate was higher among patients with childhood-onset disease (13% of 
82 childhood-onset patients vs 5% of 112 adult-onset patients). This may be partly explained by the 
higher frequency of cardiac involvement in paediatric patients. 
In summary, both childhood-onset and adult-onset EGPA are characterised by marked blood 
eosinophilia, asthma and sinusitis. The current evidence suggests that many clinical features of 
childhood-onset and adult-onset EGPA are generally similar. There may, however, be a higher 
frequency of lung and cardiac involvement, coupled with greater mortality in paediatric patients. 
Table 26: Clinical Characteristics of Paediatric and Adult EGPA Cases 
Maintenance of remission in paediatric patients 
In general terms, the therapies used to manage EGPA in paediatric patients are similar to those used 
in adults, i.e., systemic corticosteroids with adjunct use of immunosuppressive and/or cytotoxic agents 
where necessary [Boyer, 2006]. Treatment aims to improve symptoms, suppress/reduce eosinophil 
count to prevent peripheral tissue/neurological infiltration and damage by inflammation leading to a 
more severe disease progression. 
As for adult EGPA, induction and maintenance of remission and reduction in the requirement for long-
term corticosteroid use are key treatment goals. Thus, evaluation of duration of remission, prevention 
of relapse and reduction in requirement for corticosteroids are likewise key targets in the evaluation of 
an agent for the treatment of childhood EGPA. 
Extrapolation strategy 
According to the Applicant, the key steps of the extrapolation strategy are presented below: 
1.  Mepolizumab is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with EGPA: In the 
Phase III pivotal study (MEA115921) of adult subjects with EGPA, mepolizumab was efficacious with 
a safety profile similar to that observed in the severe eosinophilic asthma clinical development 
programme. 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 75/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  EGPA disease is not a covariate of mepolizumab exposure: Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics (PK) 
profile in adults with EGPA, from the Phase III pivotal study, is consistent with that of subjects with 
other eosinophilic conditions, as evidenced by the ability of the most recent meta-analysis population 
PK model to predict with great precision mepolizumab concentrations observed in the study, without 
parameter estimation.  
3.  Mepolizumab PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics: Paediatric PK data (IV: 2 to 17 years and 
SC: 12 to 17 years), collected from other eosinophilic conditions, is consistent with adult PK data 
after adjustment for bodyweight. Subcutaneous PK data in children 6 to 11 years is consistent with 
adults after adjustment for bodyweight and bioavailability.  
4.  Mepolizumab blood eosinophil count reduction in adults is predictive of the blood eosinophil count 
reduction in paediatrics: Available paediatric blood eosinophil count data from other eosinophilic 
conditions, showed consistent reductions after adjustment for baseline blood eosinophil count, 
irrespective of route of administration and age group, with similar reductions in adults with the same 
disease. In addition, the adult EGPA Phase III pivotal study confirmed a similar magnitude of blood 
eosinophil reduction in EGPA subjects as in other eosinophilic conditions, after adjustment for 
baseline (reflecting the disease), allowing extrapolation of existing paediatric blood eosinophil data to 
the EGPA paediatric population.  
5.  Evidence that mepolizumab efficacy in adults with severe asthma can be extrapolated to the 
paediatric population (adolescents [12 to 17 years]) and that establishing this evidence in the severe 
asthma population is sufficient to extend this approach to the EGPA population: Adolescent efficacy 
results from two Phase III severe asthma studies (MEA115588 and 200862), coupled with 
extrapolation analyses of these data using Bayesian robust mixture priors and bootstrap resampling 
approaches, provided evidence that mepolizumab efficacy in adults with severe asthma can be 
extrapolated to an adolescent population, thereby supporting further extrapolation of efficacy to 
children aged 6 to 11 years.  
This supports the validity of efficacy extrapolation in a disease in which eosinophil involvement is 
pivotal to the pathophysiology of the disease, and hence extrapolation for EGPA.  
6.  Confidence that the safety profile in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years) with EGPA is expected 
to be consistent with the safety profile in adults with EGPA: The safety profile observed in the Phase 
III adult EGPA study is similar to that observed in the severe asthma clinical programme. No unique 
safety concerns were identified following mepolizumab treatment in children (6 to 11 years) or 
adolescents (12 to 17 years) included in the severe asthma clinical programme, nor in paediatric 
subjects with eosinophilic oesophagitis (who received IV doses up to 10 mg/kg), nor in the Expanded 
Access Programme for HES. Therefore, the safety profile in children (6 to 11 years old) and in 
adolescent (12 to 17 years old) patients with EGPA is anticipated to be similar to that in adult 
patients with EGPA. 
Supportive study 
MEA116841 Study: Mepolizumab Long-term Access Programme for Subjects who Participated in Study 
MEA115921 (Placebo-controlled Study of Mepolizumab in the Treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis 
with Polyangiitis in Subjects Receiving Standard-of-care Therapy) 
Methods 
For participants who previously participated in MEA115921, GSK provided long-term access to 
mepolizumab. Two different approaches were utilised since regional differences require different 
approaches. Most participants obtained long-term access by enrolling in study MEA116841.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 76/142 
 
 
 
A compassionate use programme (CUP 201607), which directs treatment under a guidance document 
and defines the treating physician as the sponsor, was also offered to individual countries that could 
utilise this approach. Since 201607 was run as a CUP, the treating physician was the responsible party. 
Per local legal requirements, serious adverse event (SAE) reporting was required at a minimum. 
Furthermore, the MAH did not monitor CUP 201607, and therefore verification that all non-serious 
adverse events (AEs) were reported is not possible. The over-arching purpose of the 2 approaches is to 
support the provision of open-label mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible participants who 
participated in study MEA115921 including requiring a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of <5 
mg/day for adequate control of their EGPA.  
The applicant provided interim safety data from the mepolizumab EGPA Long-term Access Programme 
(LAP), i.e., study MEA116841 and CUP 201607.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose selection 
Adults  
No formal dose finding studies were performed in the population of patients with EGPA. 300 mg given 
once monthly seems to be based on the results of the 12-month dose-range study (MEA112997) in 
subjects with severe asthma. In this study in blood, greater reductions in absolute eosinophil counts 
were observed in the 250 mg and 750 mg IV monthly dose groups (with similar reductions for these 
groups) compared to the 75 mg IV monthly group. As a reminder, for severe asthma 100 mg dose was 
selected.  
Paediatric population  
Dosing recommendations for paediatric subjects are based on providing exposure in the same range as 
adults with EGPA. 
The proposed mepolizumab dose for adolescents with EGPA is based on the rationale of adolescent 
patients having comparable body weight and bioavailability to adults, as well as being consistent with 
the approach followed for the severe asthma indication. Overall, the use of the same dose (300 mg SC 
monthly) in adolescents as adults, regardless of weight, can be supported given that mepolizumab has 
a wide therapeutic range. Further, this dose has a favourable benefit risk profile because it maximises 
efficacy in this serious disease and no safety issues are anticipated based on clinical experience with 
severe asthma. 
Building on the learnings from the severe asthma indication, to determine a suitable dosing regimen 
for children 6 to 11 years old with EGPA, simulations and analysis in closed form were conducted to 
match as closely as possible EGPA adult exposure. A dosing regimen recommendation of 200 mg SC 
for children 6 to 11 years old with EGPA and bodyweight ≥40 kg and 100 mg SC for bodyweight <40 
kg every 4 weeks is predicted to maintain exposure on average within 26% of adults administered 300 
mg SC. 
Of note, the applicant is requesting addition of new pack size of 9x100mg/ml multipack for pre-filled 
pens for Nucala, 100 mg/ml, solution for injection and another pack size of 9x100mg/ml multipack for 
pre-filled syringes for Nucala, 100 mg/ml, solution for injection. As a consequence, sections 6.5 and 8 
of SmPCs and section 6 of the PLs are updated accordingly, which is acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted one pivotal study supporting the use of mepolizumab in adult patients with 
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA). This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 77/142 
 
 
 
controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the treatment of relapsing or 
refractory EGPA in subjects on stable oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone/prednisolone ≥7.5 to ≤50 
mg/day) with or without concomitant stable immunosuppressant therapy excluding cyclophosphamide. 
Other background standard of care therapy was allowed during the study.  The study had three 
consecutive periods: the screening/run-in period (1-4 weeks), the study treatment period (52 weeks), 
and the follow-up period (8 weeks).  
In the study patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg mepolizumab or placebo 
SC every 4 weeks. The final dose of the treatment was given at Week 48 with completion of the 
treatment period at Week 52. From Week 4 (Visit 4) onwards, the OCS dose could be tapered 
downwards according to standard of care practice. A recommended, but not required, tapering 
schedule was provided.  
The rationale for use in paediatric population is based on full extrapolation as discussed below. 
Inclusion criteria  
The diagnosis of EGPA is challenging and different strategies have been used, all with advantages and 
disadvantages for diagnosis. In 1984 Lanham et al proposed a definition based on the following 
criteria: presence of bronchial asthma, blood eosinophilia of over 1500/microliter and vasculitis 
involving at least 2 extrapulmonary organs. The value of blood eosinophilia required for enrolment to 
this pivotal study was lower (>1.0 x 109/L) as compared to the value included in the Lanham’s 
definition. It is known that eosinophils levels could be lowered by steroids. Nevertheless, the applicant 
was requested to discuss and justify the value of blood eosinophilia used for enrolment, as it is not in 
line with the Lanham’s definition.  
The applicant clarified that the pivotal study was using the definition proposed by the Revised 
International Chapel Hill consensus conference nomenclature of vasculitis (CHCC). One of the 
important new key features of the CHCC definition is that different to its precursor definitions, the 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria of 1990 and the Lanham diagnostic 
criteria of 1984, there is no request anymore in regard to the previously requested minimal thresholds 
in order to define EGPA. 
The diagnosis of EGPA is especially difficult before the onset of vasculitis particularly in ANCA-negative 
patients, EGPA manifestations may mimic other diseases (e.g., eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic 
pneumonia or HES). All patients were enrolled through centres with experience with diagnosis and 
management of EGPA. 
All patients were required to have an asthma and blood eosinophilia of over 1000/microliter plus at 
least two additional features of EGPA. However, not all these features have the same diagnostic value.  
A positive ACNA or biopsy proof of vasculitis strongly support the diagnosis of EGPA. On the other 
hand, naso-sinus abnormalities and peripheral neuropathy are less characteristic. 
It is noted that subjects with organ threatening or life-threatening EGPA were excluded from the study. 
Therefore, the CHMP requested to highlight this in the SmPC in section 4.4 where the following 
statement has been added: “Nucala has not been studied in patients with organ threatening or life-
threatening manifestations of EGPA”. 
Endpoints   
There were two co-primary endpoints, both investigating the effect of mepolizumab on remission. The 
first co-primary endpoint was the assessment of total accrued duration of remission over the 52 week 
study treatment period, reported as proportion of subjects who achieved remission in the following 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 78/142 
 
 
 
 
 
categories: Zero; >0 to <12 weeks; 12 to <24 weeks; 24 to <36 weeks; or ≥36 weeks. The second 
co-primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were in remission at both weeks 36 and 48 of 
the study treatment period. 
For the primary analysis, the remission was defined as BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day. 
In line with the EULAR recommendations for conducting clinical trials in systemic vasculitis (Hellmich, 
2007)  and in line with the Consensus Task Force recommendations for evaluation and management  
of EGPA (Groh, 2015) the definition of EGPA remission were defined as the absence of disease activity 
or systemic manifestation (excluding asthma and/or ENT symptoms). In addition, in these 
recommendations it was considered that that the complete withdrawal of OCS is not necessarily 
required to define a patient as being in a state of remission. In this context, the definition of the 
remission used in the pivotal study is acceptable by CHMP.  
Since most types of vasculitis tend to flare or may have fluctuating levels of disease activity, it is 
important that a definition of the remission is qualified by the duration spent in remission, which was 
captured as part of the primary endpoint.  
The proposed primary endpoint was discussed during the CHMP scientific advice. The CHMP agreed on 
the relevance of the remission endpoint and proposed analysis. However, it was recommended to the 
applicant to perform not only a responder analysis categorised by length of remission (0- 11 weeks, 
12- 23 weeks, 24-35 weeks, >35 weeks) but also present the raw remission time as a secondary 
endpoint.  
EGPA relapses were investigated as secondary endpoints in the study. An EGPA relapse was defined as 
worsening or persistence of active disease since the last visit characterized by active vasculitis (BVAS 
>0) or active asthma symptoms (increase in ACQ-6 score) or active nasal and/or sinus disease 
warranting changes in therapy or leading to hospitalisation.  It is noted that in line with the 
recommendation of the Task Force the definition of relapse should not include asthma and/or ENT 
symptoms.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 151 subjects were screened for this study. A total of 136 subjects were randomized, received 
at least one dose of study drug, and were included in the ITT Population. The majority of subjects in 
the ITT Population completed study treatment (90%) and completed the study (93%). 
The study population was primarily White (92%) and more than half were female (59%); the mean 
age was 48.5 years. No paediatric patients were enrolled to the study and only a small percentage 
were ≥65 years of age.   
The study enrolled a heterogeneous population as patients with recent relapses or only with a history 
of relapse or refractory disease could be enrolled. The majority of patients had relapsing disease 
(74%) whereas the refractory disease was reported 54% of subjects (subjects could have either or 
both).  
There was no requirement to have active vasculitis ((BVAS>0) at enrolment, therefore both patients 
with active and not active vasculitis could be enrolled.  In this respect, it is noted that, there were 
imbalances between the treatment group in the percentage of patients with active vasculitis at 
enrolment. The median baseline BVAS was lower in the mepolizumab group (1.0) than in the placebo 
group (2.0). In addition, in the mepolizumab group 54% of patients were recorded as having active 
vasculitis scored on BVAS as compared to 71 % of patients in the placebo group. The impact of this on 
the primary outcome was requested to be discussed.

The applicant conducted subgroup analyses for the co-primary endpoints by BVAS activity at baseline 
(defined as BVAS=0 vs BVAS>0); the results showed a benefit of mepolizumab in both subgroups. In 
addition, exploratory analysis of the interaction between treatment and baseline BVAS score showed 
no evidence that the effect of mepolizumab differed depending on the baseline BVAS score as a 
continuous variable. 
More subjects in the mepolizumab group were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at baseline and 
during treatment (60% and 62%) compared with the placebo group (46% and 47%).  
It is noted that the majority of subjects (69%) had ACQ-6 scores >0.75 indicating a lack of asthma 
control. Nineteen percent of subjects had a history of a positive ANCA test. There is some discussion in 
the literature, whether ANCA-negative and ANCA-positive EGPA patients represent the same disease 
entity and whether the approach to treatment should be the same for these subpopulations. The 
applicant was requested to comment and present the study results (primary endpoints) depending on 
the ANCA status.  
A total of 26 (19%) subjects was positive for ANCA historically, 13 (19%) in the mepolizumab 
treatment group and 13 (19%) in the placebo treatment group. The 12 subjects which tested positive 
for ANCA during the study represents 9% of the 136 subjects investigated. These results are 
consistent with previous studies which have shown that after treatment is initiated and during 
remission, few subjects (16%, 10.8%) were ANCA positive [Keogh, 2006; Sinico, 2005]. Since 
subjects were required to be on stable doses of EGPA treatment prior to study entry, a low percentage 
of ANCA positive tests is consistent with a population that is not experiencing a relapse at that time. 
[Cornec, 2016]. This clarification was acceptable by CHMP.  
Co-primary endpoints 
There were two co-primary endpoints, both investigating the effect of mepolizumab on remission.  
The first co-primary endpoint was the assessment of total accrued duration of remission (reported as 
proportion of subjects who achieved remission in the following categories: Zero; >0 to <12 weeks; 12 
to <24 weeks; 24 to <36 weeks; or ≥36 weeks. The second co-primary endpoint was the proportion of 
subjects who were in remission at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study treatment period. 
These two co-primary efficacy endpoints were met. Subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a 
significantly greater accrued time in remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) over the 52-week 
treatment period compared with subjects who received placebo (Odds ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) 
was 5.91, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value <0.001). 
Secondary endpoints  
Frequency of Relapses  
Over the 52-week treatment period, fewer subjects treated with mepolizumab (56%) had EGPA 
relapses compared with subjects who received placebo (82%) and the number of relapse events was 
lower with mepolizumab (88 events) compared with placebo (154 events). Subjects treated with 
mepolizumab had a 50% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving 
placebo (p<0.001). 
The applicant was requested to present the results (Time to First EGPA Relapse, annualized relapse 
rate) for relapsed within vasculitis category. A summary of EGPA vasculitis relapses during the 52-
week treatment period and an analysis of the time to first EGPA vasculitis relapse was presented by 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 80/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the applicant. These results confirmed the positive effect of mepolizumab treatment in prevention of 
vasculitis relapses. 
A significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved remission (BVAS=0 
and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study compared with subjects who 
received placebo (Odds ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) was 16.74, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value 
<0.001). 
19 % subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) 
within the first 24 weeks of the study and remained in remission for the remainder of the 52-week 
treatment period. The remaining patients who did achieve remission, then relapsed.  
It is noted that a significant percentage of patients (47%) in the mepolizumab group did not achieve 
remission while on treatment. Further only 13% of patients achieved a long-term remission (≥36 
weeks). The applicant was requested to discuss the approach to patients who are not responding to 
treatment. The applicant clarified that treatment should be continued as long as patients experience 
clinical benefit in the view of the physician and the benefit/risk is in favour of mepolizumab. This 
should be based on the physician’s clinical judgment, which is guided by the patient’s clinical status. 
Therefore, the following statement was agreed after discussion with CHMP in particular to highlight 
that the need for the continuation of therapy should be also reviewed in case of lack/insufficient 
responses to treatment or in case of development of life-threatening complications. 
In the SmPC section 4.2 the following statement is included: 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be reviewed at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
improvement of symptom control. Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of EGPA should 
also be evaluated for the need for continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this 
population. 
During the follow up period, once the treatment with mepolizumab was stopped, it seemed that more 
relapses were reported in the group of patients originally assigned to mepolizumab. The applicant was 
asked to discuss whether there any possibility of a rebound in the immunological response once 
treatment is halted? The applicant clarified that while symptoms that were controlled under 
mepolizumab treatment may begin to recur when the patient is no longer under treatment, these 
symptoms have not been found to be worse than at baseline. Further, safety was not affected as the 
occurrence of post-treatment AEs was similar between the mepolizumab (49%) and placebo (51%) 
treatment groups. 
OCS Dose Reduction 
OCS Dose Reduction is a very important treatment goal in patients with EGPA. Some reduction in the 
OCS dose was possible in the majority of patients treated with mepolizumab.  
Median reductions from baseline were greater in the mepolizumab group (-1.90 to -7.50 mg/day) 
compared with the placebo group (-0.11 to -2.50 mg/day). In addition, subjects treated with 
mepolizumab had a lower average daily OCS dose during Weeks 48 to 52 compared with subjects who 
received placebo (p<0.001). In the mepolizumab group, 12 subjects (18%) were able to taper off OCS 
completely compared with 2 subjects (3%) in the placebo group.

Vasculitis damage index 
Vasculitis damage index (VDI) is used for recording organ damage that has occurred in patients since 
the onset of vasculitis.  At baseline mean VDI was similar between the mepolizumab (4.7) and placebo 
(4.4) groups. At week 24 and week 52 there was a small increase recorded in both treatment groups 
and the difference between the treatment groups was not statistically significant. Therefore, based on 
the available data it cannot be concluded that the treatment with mepolizumab is preventing 
development of organ damage. The reason for such inconclusive results in relation to the development 
of organ damage in this study may be because of an insufficiently long observation period. The 
applicant was requested to discuss the duration of observation period and provide the relevant 
literature references which would be required to examine development of organ damage and discuss 
whether there is a link between the reduction of relapses and improved survival and/or prevention of 
organ damage. The applicant clarified that a link between the reduction of relapses and improved 
survival and/or prevention of organ damage is suggested and highly plausible. Summarizing current 
literature, this link is complex and, at least in part impacted by the natural history of the disease, 
applied immunosuppressive/ immune modulator therapy as well as early diagnosis of asymptomatic 
critical disease features. 
Consideration was given as to whether a statement concerning prevention of development of organ 
damage or improvement in survival should be included in the SmPC for the prescribers. However, 
these criteria were not objectives or endpoints in the pivotal trial. Therefore, as prevention of 
development of organ damage and improvement in survival were not measured in the clinical 
development program the applicant considered that it is not appropriate to include these statements in 
the SmPC to which the CHMP agreed.   
Subgroup analyses 
In the subgroup analysis of the first primary endpoint, the interaction between baseline blood 
eosinophil group and treatment group was significant (p<0.001). There was a greater accrued time in 
remission in the mepolizumab group compared with placebo, in subjects with a baseline blood 
eosinophil Count of ≥150 cells/µL as compared to those with blood eosinophil count of <150 cells/µL. 
A post hoc analysis showed that over the 52-week treatment period, subjects treated with 
mepolizumab who had a baseline blood eosinophil count <150 GI/L had an 11% reduction in 
annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving placebo, whereas subjects with a baseline 
blood eosinophil count ≥0.150 GI/L had a 66% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with 
subjects receiving placebo.  Nevertheless, it can be agreed by CHMP that in both subgroups better 
responses were observed in patients receiving mepolizumab compared to those on placebo and 
therefore the use of the product in patients with blood eosinophil count of <150 cells/µL is considered 
justified.  
Use in paediatric population  
The prevalence of paediatric EGPA is very low, with approximately 100 cases identified in the literature 
worldwide between 1951 and 2020. A clinical programme for paediatric EGPA was not considered 
feasible and, instead, a full extrapolation approach (i.e., extrapolation without any clinical data in the 
paediatric population with EGPA) of the efficacy and safety data from the single pivotal Phase III adult 
EGPA study was proposed, to support a paediatric indication in the 6 to 17 years age group. 
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) was agreed with the EMA which relies on a full extrapolation 
approach (PIP EMEA-000069-PIP04-13-M02). 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 82/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The extrapolation strategy is based on the following claims:  
•  Mepolizumab is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects with EGPA 
• 
EGPA disease is not a covariate of mepolizumab exposure 
•  Mepolizumab PK in adults is predictive of PK in paediatrics 
•  Mepolizumab blood eosinophil count reduction in adults is predictive of the blood eosinophil count 
reduction in paediatrics. 
• 
Evidence  that  mepolizumab  efficacy  in  adults  with  severe  asthma  can  be  extrapolated  to  the 
paediatric population (adolescents [12 to 17 years]) and that establishing this evidence in the 
severe asthma population is sufficient to extend this approach to the EGPA population 
•  Confidence  that  the  safety  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  (6  to  17  years)  with  EGPA  is 
expected to be consistent with the safety profile in adults with EGPA 
The paediatric indication for patients aged 6 to 17 years old is supported by a full extrapolation 
strategy. There is supportive evidence (from patients with severe asthma), that mepolizumab efficacy 
in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population. The applicant claims that this finding 
supports the validity of efficacy extrapolation in a disease in which eosinophil involvement is pivotal to 
the pathophysiology of the disease, and hence extrapolation for EGPA. This is only partially supported 
by CHMP because there are differences in the disease between children and adults. It can be agreed 
that mepolizumab could be a valid treatment option in paediatric patients. However, due to the 
apparent differences in the course of the disease in children, there are uncertainties whether children 
aged 6 and older respond to the treatment mepolizumab in the same way. While it is agreed with the 
applicant that due to extreme rarity of EGPA in children is not feasible to perform a RCT in paediatric 
patients the CHMP considered that the data on the use in children could be collected in the 
postmarking setting.   
The applicant provided a discussion and rationale for the sentinel paediatric study which would address 
concerns in relation to post marketing data capturing for this ultra-rare paediatric condition. It is 
agreed that existing healthcare data sources, the clinical trial register and known vasculitis registries 
from EU countries are not considered appropriate as potential sources to robustly describe safety or 
efficacy data in children. This limitation is acknowledged. The applicant will focus recruitment at the 
major specialist paediatric European sites specifically in the UK, France, Germany, Spain & Italy. 10 
paediatric participants are expected to be treated over a 5 year period which is a reasonable 
estimation based on the current European incidence rate provided by the applicant. The treating 
physicians will perform a benefit risk analysis for the patient being treated with mepolizumab and 
clinical details such as disease management, treatment response and AEs will be captured from the 
medical records as descriptive analysis only.  
Indication  
The following indication was originally proposed by the applicant:  
“Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for patients aged 6 years and older with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis.” 
The proposed indication was not agreed as the CHMP considered that the proposed indication is too 
broad as subjects enrolled to the pivotal study were required to have a history of relapsing or 
refractory disease on stable corticosteroid therapy.   
The wording ‘a history of’ was requested by CHMP to be deleted from the indication: The reason is, 
that the indication should reflect a current status of relapsing or refractory EGPA, rather than history 
per se, in line with treatment need and pivotal trial design.  
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 83/142 
 
 
 
The indication was updated and agreed by CHMP as follows: 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for patients aged 6 years and older with 
relapsing-remitting or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data support the amended indication as an add-on treatment for patients aged 6 years and 
older with relapsing-remitting or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Collection of 
efficacy data in the paediatric population in the post-marketing setting is recommended to gather data 
of the treatment response in children. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The applicant’s safety summary focuses on the safety data from the pivotal phase 3 clinical study in 
136 adult subjects with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (MEA115921). This study 
included 68 adult subjects who received mepolizumab 300 mg SC. Supportive safety data are also 
presented from the follow-on Long-term Access Programme (LAP), which enrolled 115 participants 
from study MEA115921 and is ongoing as of 01 June 2020; interim safety results are integrated for the 
safety summary as of the 23 September 2019 data cut-off date for iCSR. The purpose of the LAP, 
which comprises GSK-sponsored study MEA116841 and also a Compassionate Use Programme (CUP), 
led by the treating physician under Guidance Document 201607, is to support the provision of open-
label mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible patients who participated in MEA115921 and who 
require a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of ≥5 mg/day for adequate control of their EGPA. Of the 
115 participants in the LAP, 100 participants are from study MEA116841 and 15 participants are from 
CUP 201607. The data cut-off date for the LAP was 23 September 2019. 
A summary of the integrated safety data with mepolizumab in paediatric patients with severe asthma, 
HES and EoE and the proposed full extrapolation of the EGPA adult efficacy and safety data to 
paediatrics (6-17 years) with EGPA was provided in this application. 
Key safety data from the MAH-sponsored mepolizumab clinical development programme have been 
integrated for the Safety Summary (completed studies and ongoing studies with an interim report). 
This comprises 4363 subjects who received mepolizumab and 2087 subjects who received placebo in 
clinical programmes in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), EGPA, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), and other eosinophil-driven 
diseases, as well as healthy subjects. 
An integrated analysis of immunogenicity was performed using pooled data for 1327 unique subjects 
from 3 Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled severe asthma (PCSA) clinical studies 
(24 to 56 weeks in treatment duration) in order to more accurately evaluate antibody dynamics and 
potential impact of anti-mepolizumab antibodies on pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), 
and safety parameters. The potential for mepolizumab to produce immunotoxicity was evaluated based 
on weight of evidence gathered from nonclinical and clinical data and expected pharmacology. 
However, there are no data specific for EGPA patients.

Patient exposure 
A total of 4363 subjects have received at least one dose of mepolizumab in a MAH sponsored study or 
program, and 2087 subjects received placebo. 
Study MEA115921 
One-hundred and thirty-six subjects were exposed to treatment for up to 52 weeks in study 
MEA115921; 68 subjects were exposed to mepolizumab 300 mg SC and 68 subjects were exposed to 
placebo. The majority of subjects in each treatment group received all 13 scheduled treatments (85% 
mepolizumab and 74% placebo). Total exposure to 300mg mepolizumab was 66.68 subject years. Four 
subjects (3 in the mepolizumab group and 1 in the placebo group) received 14 treatments; these were 
reported as protocol deviations.

Exposure to mepolizumab treatment in MEA116841 and CUP 201607 and exposure to prior treatment 
with placebo or mepolizumab in lead study MEA115921 are summarised in Table 28. In total, 85% 
(115/136) of subjects from study MEA115921 (56 who received mepolizumab in MEA115921 and 59 
who received placebo in MEA115921) went on to receive mepolizumab 300 mg SC in the LAP after a

possible treatment break of up to 6 months. Total exposure to mepolizumab 300 mg SC in MEA116841 
and CUP 201607 was approximately 299 subject-years. The mean number of treatments administered 
was approximately 32, with the number of treatments administered ranging from a minimum of 1 to a 
maximum of 59. 
Table 28: Summary of Exposure (therapeutic coverage) to Treatment (MEA116841 and CUP 
201607 Safety Populations) 
In total, 127 subjects have received mepolizumab 300 mg SC to treat EGPA: 68 subjects received 
mepolizumab in MEA115921 (56 of whom went on to receive mepolizumab in the LAP [MEA116841 or 
CUP 201607]) and 59 subjects who received placebo in MEA115921 went on to receive mepolizumab in 
the LAP. 
Total treatment exposure for the 127 subjects who received mepolizumab 300 mg SC (either in study 
MEA115921 alone, or in addition to the LAP if they continued on) was 365.89 subject-years

Adverse events  
Study MEA115921 
The incidence of AEs within each System Organ Class (SOC) was higher in the mepolizumab group 
compared with the placebo group for the majority of SOCs. The largest difference was in the incidence 
of Skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC (44% mepolizumab and 19% placebo), primarily due to 
higher incidences of events of rash, pruritus, urticaria, and skin lesion with mepolizumab. Hot flushing 
was the main cause of the imbalance in vascular disorders.

Either Treatment Group (Study MEA115921, Safety Population) 
The overall incidence of on-treatment AEs by PT was similar between the mepolizumab (97%) and 
placebo (94%) groups. The most frequent on-treatment AEs were headache, arthralgia, sinusitis, and 
upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the mepolizumab group and nasopharyngitis, nausea, 
headache, and arthralgia in the placebo group. The incidence of headache was higher in the 
mepolizumab group (32%) compared with the placebo group (18%), and the incidence of 
nasopharyngitis was higher in the placebo group (24%) compared with the mepolizumab group (18%). 
Other than headache, no other PTs were reported with >10% difference between the treatment 
groups. Other most frequent AEs with >5% higher incidence in the mepolizumab group compared with 
placebo included diarrhoea, vomiting, and neck pain.

of AEs that were severe were also serious. In the mepolizumab arm all of the severe non-fatal SAEs 
had resolved and 3 were considered drug related by the investigator which are captured in the 
labelling and RMP: abdominal pain, hypersensitivity, UTI. 
Table 33: Maximum intensity of Adverse events for Mepolizumab 300 mg SC 
Non-serious events that were considered severe in intensity in the mepolizumab group were: sinusitis, 
headache, and pain in extremity reported for 2 subjects each, and nasopharyngitis, lower respiratory 
tract infection, kidney infection, fatigue, asthenia, arthralgia, back pain, neck pain, intervertebral disc 
protrusion, diarrhoea, vomiting, dyspnoea, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, bronchitis, and asthma 
reported for 1 subject each. 
Drug-related Adverse Events 
The incidence of AEs considered drug-related by the investigators was higher in the mepolizumab 
group (51%) compared with the placebo group (35%) (Table 34). The greatest differences were in 
the incidences of drug-related headache (7% mepolizumab and 1% placebo) and respiratory tract 
infection (6% mepolizumab and 0% placebo).

The AEs reported by more than 2 participants in CUP 201607 were: asthenia, bronchitis, headache, 
nasopharyngitis, cough, influenza like illness, and respiratory tract infection. 
In MEA116841, on-treatment AEs (98% for both previous placebo and previous mepolizumab) were 
generally similar between participants who were in the previous placebo and previous mepolizumab 
arms in MEA115921.  
The SOCs with a >10% difference between previous placebo and previous mepolizumab arms were:  
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (19/51 [37%] previous placebo vs. 25/49 
[61%] previous mepolizumab)  
• 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (21/51 [41%] previous placebo vs. 14/49 
[29%] previous mepolizumab).  
The PTs with a >10% difference between previous placebo and previous mepolizumab arms were: 
bronchitis (11/51 [22%] previous placebo vs. 18/49 [37%] previous mepolizumab), nasopharyngitis 
(18/51 [35%] previous placebo vs. 11/49 [22%] previous mepolizumab),  sinusitis (11/51 [22%] 
previous placebo vs. 16/49 [33%] previous mepolizumab), back pain (5/51 [10%] previous placebo 
vs. 12/49 [24%] previous mepolizumab). 
The safety profile was consistent with that described for MEA115921, with no new safety concerns 
identified at the time of the interim data cut-off date. 
Adverse Events by Maximum Intensity 
The majority of AEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe AEs that were reported in >1 
participant were: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, sinusitis, arthralgia, pain in extremity, asthma, headache, 
and myocardial infarction. Of all the severe events were also assessed as serious AEs by the investigator.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study MEA115921 
The overall incidence of on-treatment SAEs was lower in the mepolizumab group (12 subjects, 18%) 
compared with the placebo group (18 subjects, 26%). Three SAEs were reported for more than one 
subject: asthma (2 subjects in the mepolizumab group and 4 subjects in the placebo group), influenza 
(2 subjects in the placebo group), and pneumonia (2 subjects in the placebo group). 
Table 42: On-Treatment Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class including Specific 
Events Occurring in More than One Subject (Study MEA115921, Safety Population) 
Non-fatal SAEs which were considered drug-related by the investigator were reported for 6 subjects, 3 
in each treatment group: urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, and hypersensitivity in the 
mepolizumab group and LRTI, pneumonia, and testis cancer in the placebo group. Most SAEs resolved 
during the study except pachymeningitis (verbatim term: relapse of pachymeningitis), which was 
resolving at the end of the study, in the mepolizumab group (one subject) and spinal fracture in the 
placebo group (one subject). Two subjects had non-fatal SAEs that led to discontinuation of study 
treatment/withdrawal from the study, hypersensitivity in the mepolizumab group (one subject) and 
pneumonia in the placebo group. 
Post-treatment SAEs were reported for 6 subjects: 1 subject (1%) in the mepolizumab group and 5 
subjects (7%) in the placebo group. Post-treatment SAEs in the mepolizumab group was joint 
dislocation and in the placebo group were influenza, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), respiratory 
tract infection, foot fracture, pain in extremity, and vasculitis (1 subject each).

One death (mepolizumab group) was reported during the study due to a cardiac arrest. The subject 
had a history of coronary artery disease. This fatal event was not considered related to study 
treatment by the investigator. 
Long-term Access Programme (MEA116841) (CUP 201607) 
Overall, 35 (35%) participants reported on-treatment SAEs in MEA116841. This included 1 participant 
who had 3 fatal SAEs reported (see Section 6.2.1). The SAEs reported by 3 or more participants were 
asthma, pneumonia, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Table 43). 
Table 43: Summary of On-Treatment Serious Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of 
Participants (MEA 116841 Safety Population) 
Most non-fatal SAEs in study MEA116841 had resolved at the time of data cut-off and few non-fatal 
SAEs led to discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study. One participant had SAEs of 
asthma, myalgia, and paraesthesia that were resolving, and an SAE of arthralgia that was not 
resolved; these SAEs led to withdrawal from the study. Another participant had an SAE of colon cancer 
that resolved but led to withdrawal from the study. 
As of the cut-off date, 1 death has occurred in study MEA116841 (LAP). The subject, who had 
previously received treatment with placebo in MEA115921, reported fatal AE terms of dyspnoea, 
hypoxia and cardiac arrest. These events were considered by the investigator to be related to the 
subject’s underlying conditions and not treatment with mepolizumab. 
Five (5%) participants in study MEA116841 reported on-treatment drug-related SAEs of bronchitis, 
cellulitis, corona virus infection (reported in 2017), pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus infection, 
colon cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. Cellulitis and pneumonia were each reported by 2 (2%) 
participants as drug related, all other events were reported by 1 (1%) participant each. There was no 
on-treatment drug-related SAEs reported for CUP 201607. 
No fatal drug-related SAEs were reported for either MEA116841 or CUP 201607.

Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) 
Study MEA115921 
Within the clinical development programme, the following are the AESIs for mepolizumab EGPA 
programme: systemic (allergic/hypersensitivity and non-allergic) reactions, local injection site 
reactions, infections (including serious and opportunistic), malignancies, and cardiac disorders 
including serious cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic (CVT), and serious ischaemic events. 
Systemic reactions: No cases of anaphylaxis considered related to study treatment with mepolizumab 
by the investigator were reported. Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity, occurred following 
mepolizumab administration; most events were mild in intensity and resolved with continued 
treatment. One hypersensitivity event in the mepolizumab group was considered severe and serious; 
this event resolved but led to study treatment discontinuation. 
Infections were reported most frequently and with a similar incidence in the mepolizumab and placebo 
groups (84% and 78%, respectively), while the incidence of serious infections was lower in the 
mepolizumab group (6%) compared with the placebo group (15%). No parasitic infections were 
reported in either treatment group. The incidence of events identified based on a predefined list of 
terms as potentially representing opportunistic infections was 7% in the mepolizumab group and 3% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 101/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the placebo group. The incidence of systemic reactions was 6% in the mepolizumab group and 1% in 
the placebo group. 
Table 46: Adverse Events of Special Interest (Safety Population) 
Review of individual events potentially representing opportunistic infections indicated that, based on 
their characteristics, events of ‘herpes simplex’ and ‘candida infection’ did not meet the criteria for 
opportunistic infections in the setting of biological therapy. Therefore, mepolizumab did not appear to 
increase the risk of opportunistic infections in subjects with EGPA in MEA115921. 
Malignancies: No malignancies were reported in MEA115921 in the mepolizumab arm. 
Cardiac Disorders 
On-treatment AEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC were reported for 4 subjects (6%) in the mepolizumab 
group and 6 subjects (9%) in the placebo group. Specific AEs in this SOC that were reported for more 
than one subject included palpitations (1 subject in the mepolizumab group and 2 subjects in the 
placebo group) and atrial fibrillation (2 subjects in the placebo group). 
SAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC were reported for 1 subject (1%) in the mepolizumab group 
(cardiac arrest; fatal outcome) and 2 subjects (3%) in the placebo group (coronary artery disease; 
stress cardiomyopathy). 
Pre-specified CV events were adjudicated for 4 subjects; 2 in the mepolizumab group and 2 in the 
placebo group (Table 47).

Table 47: Adjudicated CV Events and All Cause Deaths (MEA115921, Safety Population) 
Serious CVT and Ischemic Adverse Events 
Serious CVT/Ischemic AEs were reported for 2 subjects in the mepolizumab group (3 events) and 2 
subjects in the placebo group (2 events). Events in the mepolizumab group were cardiac arrest for 1 
subject and cerebellar ischemia and lacunar infarction for another subject. Events in the placebo group 
were coronary artery disease and stress cardiomyopathy. None were considered drug related. All 
CVT/ischemic events, except the cardiac arrest (mepolizumab group) which was fatal, resolved during 
the study while continuing treatment. All four subjects who experienced serious CVT AEs had a CV 
history or risk.

Similar to the pivotal study, infections were reported most frequently in MEA116841 and CUP 201607 
(85% and 60%, respectively); serious infections were reported by 16 subjects in MEA116841 and 2 
subjects in CUP 201607. No parasitic infections were reported in either MEA116841 or CUP 201607. In 
MEA116841, 7 (7%) participants reported events potentially representing an opportunistic infection 
including which is the % that occurred in the pivotal study: herpes simplex 3 (3%) participants, oral 
herpes 2 (2%) participants, and aspergillus infection, herpes zoster, and oesophageal candidiasis 
reported by 1 (1%) participant each. One subject in CUP 201607 reported an opportunistic infection 
(non-serious event of herpes zoster). In the LAP, no events of anaphylaxis were reported. The 
incidence of systemic reactions was 4% in MEA116841, with none occurring in CUP 201607. Three of 
the systemic reactions were reported in subjects who were randomised to placebo in MEA115921 and 
one was reported in a participant who was previously randomised to mepolizumab in MEA115921. All 
were mild, non-serious, considered related to study treatment by the investigators and resolved with 
continued treatment. 
In the LAP, the incidence of on-treatment AEs in the cardiac disorders SOC for study MEA116841 was 
(12 participants, [12%]), and in CUP 201607 (1 [7%]). Serious CVT AEs were reported for 9 (9%) 
subjects in MEA116841. Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction were each reported by 2 (2%) 
participants; arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, transient ischaemic 
attack, and vasculitis were each reported by 1 (1%) participant. There were no serious CVT AEs 
reported in CUP 201607. One subject in the LAP died; fatal events reported were severe dyspnoea, 
hypoxia and cardiac arrest. The investigator considered this death to be related to the subject’s 
underlying conditions. 
Protocol-specified cardiovascular events were reported by the investigators for 11 (11%) participants 
in MEA116841 and 1 (7%) participant in CUP 201607. In MEA116841, the reported cardiovascular 
events were categorised as arrhythmias (6 participants), cerebrovascular events stroke and transient 
ischaemic attack (3 participants), myocardial infarction/unstable angina (3 participants), and 
congestive heart failure (1 participant). In CUP 201607, the reported cardiovascular event was 
arrhythmia. 
Summary of safety in adults with EGPA in the pivotal study MEA115921 
Based on the experience in study MEA115921 ( 
Assessment report

Figure 28) and supported by the experience in the LAP, the risk profile of mepolizumab 300 mg SC in 
the treatment of EGPA is consistent with that observed in the severe eosinophilic asthma programme, 
and no new safety concerns have been identified.  
Assessment report

Page 105/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 28: Risk Plot – Mepolizumab vs Placebo (Study MEA115921, ITT Population) 
Mepolizumab 300 mg, administered as 3 injections of 100 mg SC every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, was 
well-tolerated in subjects with EGPA enrolled in Study MEA115921, with no new safety concerns 
identified compared with the severe asthma clinical programme. The overall incidence of AEs and type 
of AEs reported were similar with placebo and mepolizumab. 
There was no increase in risk of serious adverse events (SAEs), local injection site reactions, 
infections, including serious and opportunistic, neoplasms, malignancies, or cardiac disorders including 
serious cardiac disorders, and serious cardiac, vascular and thromboembolic/ischemic events 
[MEA115921 CSR]. There were no events of anaphylaxis considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator. A small number of events were considered by the investigator to represent systemic 
reactions, with a higher incidence on mepolizumab. One fatal SAE, considered unrelated to study 
treatment by the investigator, was reported in this study: cardiac arrest in a subject with history of 
coronary heart disease in the mepolizumab group. At anytime post baseline, 2 subjects tested positive 
for anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 1 subject in the mepolizumab group and 1 subject in the placebo 
group. No neutralising antibodies were reported for either subject. No adverse event (AE) was common 
to both subjects, and there was no alteration in PD profiles. 
The AESIs listed are captured in the current version of the RMP as safety concerns: systemic reaction 
including anaphylaxis, alterations in immune response (malignancies) and cardiovascular safety. 
Hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions are also listed as a warning in the product 
information. The overall risk of AESIs of systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions, local site 
reactions, infections, malignancies, CV disorders and immunogenicity is low. 
Opportunistic infections occurred at a higher frequency in the mepolizumab group however these 
resolved with continued study treatment. All were non-serious and 1 herpes zoster event was 
considered related to the treatment by the investigator.

Laboratory findings 
Study MEA115921 
Vital Signs and Weight 
At baseline, mean diastolic and systolic pressure, pulse and weight were slightly lower in the 
mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group (Table 50). Mean baseline body temperature 
was similar between the treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in all parameters were small 
and no treatment effect was apparent. 
Table 50: Change from Baseline in Vital Signs and Weight During the Treatment Period 
(Study MEA115921, Safety Population) 
Very few subjects in either treatment group had changes from baseline to outside the normal range in 
diastolic blood pressure (maximum 2% mepolizumab and 3% placebo), systolic blood pressure 
(maximum 1% mepolizumab and 5% placebo), or pulse rate (maximum 3% mepolizumab and 7% 
placebo) at any time during the study (Table 50). All of these changes were increases from baseline, 
except for one subject in the mepolizumab group who had an isolated reduction in systolic blood 
pressure. 
Electrocardiograms 
At Screening, abnormal, clinically significant results were reported for a similar number of subjects in 
each treatment group (9 subjects, 13% mepolizumab and 9 subjects, 14% placebo); however at 
baseline, abnormal, clinically significant ECG findings were reported for more subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 107/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mepolizumab group (15 subjects, 22%) compared with the placebo group (5 subjects, 7%). At any 
visit post-baseline, where the worst-case finding was reported for each subject, abnormal, clinically 
significant findings were reported for 22 subjects (32%) in the mepolizumab group and 17 subjects 
(25%) in the placebo group. 
Table 51: Maximum Post-Baseline Values and Change from Baseline in QTc Interval (Study 
MEA115921, Safety Population) 
Absolute and mean changes from baseline in ECG values were similar between the treatment groups 
and similar to baseline over the course of the study with the exception of aggregate PR interval, which 
had slightly larger changes in the mepolizumab group (3.6 to 5.1 msec) compared with the placebo 
group (-0.8 to 1.3 msec). Mean maximum changes from baseline in aggregate QTc(F) and QTc(B) 
intervals were similar between the treatment groups (15.4 msec mepolizumab and 16.9 msec placebo, 
and 18.1 msec mepolizumab and 18.8 msec placebo, respectively). 
Results for QTc intervals were generally similar between the treatment groups. Almost all subjects had 
maximum post-baseline QTc(F) values ≤450 msec (97% mepolizumab and 96% placebo) and the 
majority of subjects had QTc(B) values ≤450 msec (76% mepolizumab and 74% placebo) (Table 51). 
One subject in the placebo group had post-baseline QTc(F) and QTc(B) values >500 msec. An AE of 
ECG prolonged QT was reported for this subject (a 63-year-old male) at the Week 32 visit. This was an 
isolated occurrence which was recorded as resolved in 12 days. 
The majority of subjects had maximum changes from baseline of ≥0 to <30 msec in QTc(F) (69% 
mepolizumab and 72% placebo) or QTc(B) (69% mepolizumab and 62% placebo) (Table 51). No 
subjects had decreases from baseline in QTc(F) or QTc(B) of more than -30 msec. Increases from 
baseline ≥60 msec in QTc(F) and QTc(B) were recorded in the placebo group for 1 and 2 subjects, 
respectively.

No hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities of concern were reported during the study. Except for 
changes to high in glucose (26% mepolizumab and 34% placebo), changes to outside the normal 
range occurred with a comparable incidence in both treatment groups and no treatment-related trends 
were apparent.

Table 53: Hematology Changes from Baseline Relative to the Reference Range at Any Post-
baseline Visit (Incidence >10% in Either Treatment Group) (Study MEA115921, Safety 
Population) 
Eosinophil data were a pharmacodynamic measure for this study and are reported in the clinical 
pharmacology section. Other than measures related to eosinophils, mean changes from baseline in 
haematology parameters were minimal in both treatment groups over the course of the study. No 
subjects had haematology changes from baseline that met pre-defined potential clinical concern 
values. Treatment-emergent AEs of anaemia were reported for 2 subjects in the mepolizumab group 
(anaemia) and 1 subject in the placebo group (iron-deficiency anaemia).  
Immunogenicity ADAs 
MEA115921 study 
A total of 135 subjects were tested for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies. Two subjects in 
the mepolizumab group tested positive for ADA at baseline. None of their samples were positive post-
dosing. 
At anytime post baseline, 2 subjects tested positive for ADA, 1 subject (1%) in the mepolizumab group 
(a 20-year-old female) and 1 subject (1%) in the placebo group (a 36-year-old female). For the 
subject in the mepolizumab group, a transient ADA response was detected at Week 24 with a titer of 
32. For the subject in the placebo group, a persistent ADA response was detected at Weeks 52, and 
60, with decreasing titer (32 and 16, respectively). The median titre value for each subject was 32. No 
positive neutralizing antibodies results were reported for either subject. 
For the 2 subjects that developed ADA during the 52-week treatment period, 10 AEs across 6 SOCs for 
the subject in the mepolizumab group and 17 AEs across 10 SOCs were reported for the subject in the 
placebo group. No AE was common to both subjects. Neither subject had systemic or local site 
reactions or a SAE. Blood eosinophils remained low during the 52-week treatment period for the ADA-
positive subject in the mepolizumab group (≤0.060 GI/L) and increased post-treatment to 0.230 GI/L 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 110/142 
 
 
 
 
at Week 60. For the ADA-positive subject in the placebo group, blood eosinophil levels fluctuated from 
0.020 to 0.200 GI/L over the course of the study. 
The findings in MEA115921 support the low immunogenic potential of mepolizumab. One subject in the 
mepolizumab treatment group had a transient ADA response and one subject in the placebo group had 
a persistent ADA response with a decreasing titre. Neither subject was positive for neutralizing 
antibodies, and the AE profiles for both subjects were unremarkable. 
There is no immunogenicity data from the LAP. 
Safety in special populations 
Study MEA115921 
Intrinsic Factors 
Adverse Events by Gender: 
The AE profile for both females and males was similar to the overall population (Table 46 ). In 
general, the proportion of females reporting AEs tended to be higher than males in the majority of 
SOCs. 
Adverse Events by Age: 
No formal studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Subjects <65 years comprised the majority 
of the study population and the profile of AEs reported by this age group was therefore similar to the 
overall population (MEA115921). There were only 17 subjects ≥65 years (9 in the placebo group and 8 
in the mepolizumab group) which limited the ability to compare this subgroup with the overall 
population or with subjects <65 years; however, no unique safety signals were observed in this 
subgroup. 
Adverse Events by Race: 
Subjects in the white race group comprised the majority of the study population, thus the profile of 
AEs reported by this race group was similar to the overall population (MEA115921). There were only 8 
Asian subjects (5 in the placebo group and 3 in the mepolizumab group) and 3 subjects of other races 
(2 in the placebo group and 1 in the mepolizumab group), thus with such small sample sizes, it was 
not possible to compare these subgroups with the overall population or with subjects in the White race 
group. 
Patients with hepatic impairment: 
No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. However, since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed 
proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have 
any effect on the elimination of mepolizumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Patients with renal impairment: 
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody characterized by a large molecular weight of 
149.2 kDa that precludes its elimination by glomerular filtration. Consequently, changes in renal 
function are not anticipated to impact the elimination of mepolizumab and a renal impairment study 
was not, therefore, conducted. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.

Use in pregnancy and lactation: 
During the conduct of the mepolizumab clinical development programme, female subjects were 
required to commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control (defined as 
failure rate of <1%) from the time of consent, for the duration of the trial, and for 4 months after the 
last dose of study drug administration. 
There was 1 pregnancy reported in the EGPA programme (in LAP MEA116841-CUP 201607) as of the 
cut-off date (23 September 2019). The participant discontinued study drug and withdrew from the 
study. The participant delivered a healthy newborn with no congenital anomalies. 
As of 23 September 2019, 33 pregnancies were reported for 31 female subjects receiving 
investigational product in the completed and ongoing mepolizumab studies (all indications) (Table 
54). Of the 33 pregnancies, 2 were reported in subjects who received placebo. There was 1 report of 
congenital anomalies for the live births (see description below). Two additional pregnancies were 
reported for the female partners of study subjects: 1 on placebo which resulted in a spontaneous 
abortion (study SB-240563/035), 1 on mepolizumab 100 mg SC which resulted in live birth with 
congenital anomaly (study 201312). These exposures via partner cases are not included in Table 54. 
Table 54: Reported Pregnancies in the Mepolizumab Clinical Development Programme 
(Completed and Ongoing GSK-Sponsored and Compassionate Use Studies; Status as of 23 
September 2019) 
Between the cut-off date (23 September 2019) and the submission safety cut-off date (01 June 2020), 
there have been no additional pregnancies reported. 
Two studies, 201810 and 205687, have been completed and unblinded. The live birth of healthy 
neonate in Study 201810 (Table 54) was reported for a female subject who was randomised to 
continued mepolizumab 100 mg SC in Part C of the study. The live birth with congenital anomalies of 
low haemoglobin, mild pulmonary valve stenosis, and heart murmur in Study 205687 (Table 54) was 
reported for a female subject who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC. The pregnancy was confirmed 
after the fourth dose of mepolizumab and study treatment was discontinued. Another female subject in 
Study 205687 (Table 54) who was randomised to receive placebo reported a missed abortion, 41 days 
after her first dose of placebo and was withdrawn from the study. 
Extrinsic Factors - There were no analyses of extrinsic factors performed.

Paediatric population 
Children under 6 years of age were not enrolled in the mepolizumab development programme for 
EGPA. The waiver was granted to the paediatric population from birth to less than 6 years of age, on 
the grounds that the medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit as clinical 
studies are not feasible due to none or low prevalence of diseases in this age group. 
Only adult patients with EGPA were enrolled in clinical study MEA115921. Efficacy and safety in the 
paediatric age group is supported by a full extrapolation approach which is discussed further below. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. The following is already in section 4.5 of the SmPC:  
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), via interaction 
with their cognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 
enzymes and drug transporters, however, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers in severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression on 
hepatocytes. The potential for interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study MEA115921 
Very few subjects had AEs which led to withdrawal from study treatment or from the study (3% 
mepolizumab group and 1% placebo group).Three subjects had AEs which led to discontinuation of 
study treatment or withdrawal from the study (all were SAEs): cardiac arrest (fatal) and 
hypersensitivity in the mepolizumab group and pneumonia in the placebo group.

Long-term Access Programme (MEA116841) (CUP 201607) 
Table 56: Summary of AEs Leading to Discontinuation of Study Drug and Withdrawal from 
Study (MEA 116841 Safety Population) 
Few withdrawals due to AEs occurred in the LAP. Three participants reported on treatment AEs leading 
to permanent discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study in MEA116841. 1 of these 
was a fatal event which was described earlier. For the other 2 participants, one patient developed the 
SAEs anal incontinence and colon cancer. The SAE of anal incontinence was mild in severity and not 
considered related to treatment with mepolizumab by the investigator. However, the SAE of colon 
cancer was moderate in severity, considered related to treatment with mepolizumab by the 
investigator, and led to discontinuation from study drug and withdrawal from the study. Both SAEs 
were resolved. 
The third participant who had previously received the placebo in the pivotal study, experienced an AE 
of asthma 10 days after the first and most recent dose of mepolizumab was administered, and AEs of 
arthralgia, myalgia, and paraesthesia 12 days after the first and most recent dose of mepolizumab was 
administered; treatment with mepolizumab was discontinued and the participant was withdrawn from 
the study due to these events. None of these events was assessed as serious or considered related to 
treatment with mepolizumab by the investigator. At the time of reporting, the events of asthma, 
myalgia and paraesthesia were recovering/resolving but the event of arthralgia was not resolved. 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment and withdrawal from the programme 
reported in CUP 201607. 
Post marketing experience 
A summary of safety data from post-marketing sources is presented in the European Union (EU) 
Periodic Safety Update Reports (EU-PSUR) provided to regulatory agencies on a regular basis. The 
most recent /EU-PSUR has a cut-off date of 23 September 2019. 
As of the cut-off date for the most recent EU-PSUR, NUCALA is approved in the United States of 
America (US), all EU Member States, Japan, and over 20 further countries for use in patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma, and for the treatment of patients with EGPA in the US, Japan as well as 
other countries. The cumulative exposure to NUCALA in the post-marketing setting is estimated to be 
76,383 patient-years.

The safety profile of mepolizumab from post-marketing sources remains generally similar to that 
known at initial market authorisation. During the post-marketing period, following a review of 
spontaneous post marketing reports of anaphylaxis, the mepolizumab label was updated to include 
“anaphylaxis” in the existing Warning regarding hypersensitivity reactions and in the Adverse 
Reactions section. No other adverse drug reactions were identified after initial approval based on 
clinical and post-marketing safety data to date, including in paediatric patients age 6 to 17 years. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
As previously stated, paediatric EGPA is rare, with approximately 100 cases identified in the literature 
through 2020. There is limited information available to compare childhood- versus adult-onset EGPA. 
The 4 published articles and 1 unpublished analysis by the MAH (Table 57) compared the 
characteristics of a pooled set of patients with childhood-onset EGPA versus adult-onset EGPA reported 
in published literature [Eleftheriou, 2016; Gendelman, 2013; Iudici, 2015; Zwerina, 2009]. In a MAH 
analysis, paediatric data from published literature were supplemented with individual case reports and 
these pooled results were analysed by system organ class. This population was indirectly compared 
with a pooled population of adult-onset EGPA patients, also from published literature [Sablé-
Fourtassou, 2005; Sinico, 2005]. The analysis showed that both childhood-onset and adult-onset EGPA 
are characterised by marked blood eosinophilia, asthma and sinusitis, and that many clinical features 
of childhood-onset and adult-onset EGPA are generally similar.  
While, overall, the clinical manifestations of EGPA were similar in both groups, the frequency of specific 
events, including mortality, differed between populations. Cardiac involvement was higher in 
childhood-onset (49%) versus adult-onset (26%) EGPA, but pericardial disease was similar between 
the groups. The mortality rate was higher among patients with childhood-onset disease (13% of 82 
childhood-onset patients vs. 5% of 112 adult-onset patients). This may be partly explained by the 
higher frequency of cardiac involvement in paediatric patients. The paediatric patients were less likely 
to have musculoskeletal, renal or peripheral nervous system disease, but more likely to have 
gastrointestinal or skin involvement compared with adult patients. There were no major differences in 
other organ involvement between the two groups. 
Table 57: Clinical Characteristics of Paediatric and Adult EGPA Cases 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 115/142 
 
 
 
 
 
However, it needs to be highlighted that certain caveats should be considered while interpreting these 
results: 
1. This analysis is based on an indirect comparison of pooled adult and paediatric-onset EGPA data. 
Since the adult and paediatric populations are from different sources and do not originate from the 
same base population, we did not present any formal measures of statistical significance, such as the 
p-value or confidence intervals (CI). 
2. Pooling of the data by organ system class was limited to the information reported in different 
publications. Therefore, pooling was not possible for every variable and, as noted in Table 57, the 
denominators vary as a function of the available data. 
3. If the paediatric cases reported in the literature are from specialist referral centres, as noted in the 
Cleveland Clinic report [Gendelman, 2013], they may represent a subgroup of patients with more 
severe disease. There could also be potential systematic selection of a certain type of EGPA case if 
there was selective reporting. 
4. Other caveats include potential non-uniform reporting of data elements, changes in diagnostic 
technologies over time and advancements in treatment options [Gendelman, 2013]. In addition, these 
cases have been reported across different countries where patient presentation, diagnosis and 
management may be different.

options. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Background 
Mepolizumab or Nucala is currently indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older. Nucala was initially approved by 
the EMA in December 2015 for adults only with the paediatric indication subsequently added in August 
2018. It is noted that the posology of Nucala in children and adolescents aged between 6 to 17 years 
old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma was determined by limited efficacy, pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic studies and supported by modelling and simulation data.  
A line extension to add mepolizumab solution for injection in a single-dose 100mg prefilled AI or 
single-dose 100mg prefilled glass SSD as an additional pharmaceutical form to the severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma license was approved in July 2019. Of note, this pre-filled injection pen/syringe 
pharmaceutical form is not indicated in children aged 6-11 years with eosinophilic asthma as there 
does not seem to be a 40mg prefilled injection available. Given the proposed higher dosing differences 
for children with EGPA, the pre-filled injection is an additional option. 
The most common side effects are headache, injection site reactions and back pain. It is noted 
Anaphylaxis was added to the labelling as a rare ADR in 2016. The applicant does not propose to add 
any new ADRs or safety warnings to the SmPC or amend the safety specification with this new 
indication, EGPA. 
Cumulative clinical trial exposure to mepolizumab from MAH sponsored studies is estimated to be 
4,624 subjects. Exposure to mepolizumab from marketing experience in the reporting period is 
estimated to be 39,578 patient-years. Cumulative post-marketing exposure to mepolizumab is 
estimated to be 76,383 patient-years. 
For the proposed indication (and new higher doses): Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for 
patients aged 6 years and older with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the applicant 
submitted the following safety studies specific for the EGPA patient population. The first study 
MEA115921 includes the completed pivotal study in adult patients with EGPA and the second is an 
ongoing long-term access study for adult patients with EGPA: Interim report dated June 2020, data cut 
off September 2019.  
EGPA studies MEA115921 and the LAP (MEA116841-CUP 201607) were not integrated. Data from each 
study were presented separately and an updated integrated analysis of both studies. During the 
assessment, the applicant presented updated data as of May 2021 cut off which is acceptable. A review 
of new SAE case reports received from 24th Sep 2019 to 31st May 2021 was performed. Upon CHMP 
request, the applicant confirmed that upon completion and final site closeout of MEA116841, a final 
CSR will be submitted to EMA within 1 year. 
The following paediatric study 200363 and study 200862 were also referenced but these have already 
been assessed during the variation to add a paediatric indication in patients with severe eosinophilic 
asthma (II/0013/G) and do not include patients with EGPA specifically. 
An integrated summary of immunogenicity for mepolizumab (dated 10th February 2016) in the asthma 
only population was also submitted. This report does not include the proposed new indication, EGPA. 
The report concluded that based on the available clinical data, mepolizumab has low immunogenic 
potential and anti-mepolizumab antibody formation is not expected to impact the overall clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 123/142 
 
 
 
benefit of mepolizumab treatment. The development of ADAs against mepolizumab was low and did 
not warrant treatment discontinuation or specific therapeutic management/intervention. There were no 
severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions reported for patients with anti-mepolizumab antibodies. 
There was no association between hypersensitivity type reactions or injection site reactions and 
presence of ADA. The presence of ADA therefore had a minimal effect on patients with EGPA. 
The assessment of immunotoxicity has also been submitted with no apparent emerging information 
during the period of this report update that impacts the weight of evidence for immunotoxicity risk. 
The current risk management plan includes monitoring for the increase in malignancies in the clinical 
trials. Potential immunotoxicity risks are already captured and discussed in the risk management plan. 
Regarding the compassionate use programme, the applicant was requested to clarify how this patient 
population differs from the participants being recruited from the pivotal study MEA116841 in relation to 
the safety data presented (see also earlier discussion in efficacy section). In light of this, safety results 
from this aspect of the LAP is to be interpreted as more supportive in nature taking into account the 
limitations of the data.  
EGPA adult indication 
MEA115921 was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study completed recruitment in July 
2015 with a study period between the 5th February 2014 and 5th September 2016. The CSR provided 
with this submission is dated 7th June 2017. Safety was a secondary objective comparing the IMP, 
mepolizumab with a placebo in subjects with EGPA on background standard of care treatment. As 
previously mentioned, this was an adult only study and patients were on treatment as a 52-week study 
with an 8 week follow up period. The last dose was administered at week 48 to the patient. 
The study protocol underwent 3 protocol amendments with the latest version dated June 2016. None 
of the amendments appear to be related to any significant safety issues. The independent data 
monitoring committee’s primary focus was monitoring of cardiovascular safety and all-cause mortality. 
The applicant clarified whether there were no urgent safety measures, intervention from the IDMC due 
to a safety concern or significant safety related protocol amendment made during the study.  
The participants who enrolled in the long-term access programme (implemented differently across 
countries depending on the marketing status) represented approximately 85% of the 136 participants 
that entered study MEA115921. The total exposure of 300mg of mepolizumab in patients with EGPA is 
127 with a total treatment exposure of 365 subject years. 115 patients have received mepolizumab so 
far in the LAP as of data cut off, September 2019. Of the 115 participants in the LAP, 100 participants 
are from study MEA116841 and 15 participants are from CUP 201607. There are currently some 
participants receiving treatment for >6 years.  
Adverse Events 
Given the multisystem inflammation that EGPA vasculitis can cause and the symptoms associated with 
the disease, there are multiple AEs presented that could also reflect the disease specifically for 
example myalgia, arthralgia, rash, sinusitis, neuropathy, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, fatigue. 
The AEs listed by both SOC and PT are overall expected with either the disease or mepolizumab with 
some already captured in the SmPC and RMP in particular hypersensitivity and administration-related 
reactions, infections, neck pain, headache and respiratory disorders. Frequency of events per 1000 
subject years of exposure is also presented. However, there are certain AEs listed by PT (arthralgia, 
MSK pain, sinusitis, URTI, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, urticaria, vertigo, migraine, 
oropharyngeal pain) that could be considered as related to mepolizumab given that similar ADRs are 
already captured in section 4.8 and these were reported at a higher frequency compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 124/142 
 
 
 
placebo. The applicant was requested to justify not considering these as ADRs and confirmed that no 
signal or ADRs specific for this new indication were identified. 
Despite the known safety profile in the eosinophilic asthma population, it must be acknowledged that 
patients with EGPA are a different patient population given the multisystem nature of the condition and 
therefore these patients could experience different ADRs. Of note, the applicant justified the higher 
dose rationale because “EGPA involves greater implication of eosinophils at multiple target organs and 
there is potential for significant increase in blood eosinophils preceding relapse”.  
Abnormal LFTs such as AST (n=5, 7%), ALT (n =3, 4%), GGT (n=3, 4%) elevations occurred in the 
mepolizumab arm alone. Due to the degradation by proteolytic enzymes, mepolizumab is not expected 
to have an effect on liver function, and no treatment effect on liver function was shown in the 
integrated placebo-controlled studies in severe asthma across 10-fold dose range. The applicant 
clarified the LFT results further and provided an adequate response. All AEs of abnormal liver 
chemistries in MEA115921 were non-serious, and mepolizumab was continued in all cases. In the EGPA 
LAP with over 4 times the exposure in MEA115921, AEs of ALT and AST increased were reported for 2 
(2%) subjects.  
No treatment-related trends or clinically significant findings were observed in laboratory tests, vital 
sign assessments, or ECGs. No hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities of concern were reported during 
the study and the Phase III-IV liver chemistry stopping and follow up criteria is noted in the protocol.  
It is noted that there were more cardiac disorders (any event) in the placebo arm (n=6, 9%) versus 
(n=4, 6%) in the mepolizumab arm. However, there was a cardiac arrest event in the mepolizumab 
arm which resulted in the patient dying. This event was not considered drug related. 
In study MEA115921, the most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache 
(32%), injection site reactions (15%) and back pain (13%). 
In the last PSUR assessment, the MAH was requested to discuss alopecia in the forthcoming PSUR 
based on the numbers of reports received. Upon review of the data from this pivotal EGPA study, 
alopecia was reported in 2 (3%) patients in the mepolizumab arm compared to none in the placebo 
arm which was calculated at a frequency rate of 30 per 1000 subject years of exposure. There does 
not appear to be influenza-like illness associated with the use of mepolizumab based on the AEs that 
could be reported under the SOC infection:  Influenza, Parainfluenzae virus infection, Respiratory tract 
infection viral, Viral upper respiratory tract infection. 
While reviewing the AEs, it is important to highlight that the majority of patients in the study reported 
medical conditions (current or ongoing conditions at screening). Some of these conditions could also be 
considered disease related in particular: sinusitis, allergic rhinitis/hay fever, nasal polyposis, 
gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), cardiomyopathy. As previously mentioned in the efficacy section, 
there were 63% of patients in the study that had BVAS conditions at baseline. In particular ENT and 
respiratory issues. Sino-nasal abnormality (94%) and/or non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates (72%) are 
noted in the EGPA history.  
19% of subjects had a history of a positive ANCA test, 77% had received immunosuppressive therapy 
and 42% of subjects had three or more EGPA relapses. The applicant was requested to discuss these 
subgroups further from a safety perspective specifically confirming that ANCA status at baseline, 
immunosuppressive therapy at baseline or number of EGPA relapses in previous 2 years do not appear 
to effect mepolizumab safety profile. 
The AE types by SOC reported in the LAP are similar to the 52-week pivotal study and AEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation of study treatment of withdrawal was low. Based on the safety data 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 125/142 
 
 
 
presented from the interim report, there does not appear to be any new AEs or major imbalances of 
AEs reported compared to the pivotal 52-week pivotal study.  
Serious Adverse Events 
In the pivotal study, SAEs were reported less frequently on mepolizumab compared with placebo, with 
asthma, influenza, and pneumonia being the most commonly reported. 
The applicant states that there is no known reason to expect that the safety profile of mepolizumab 
would differ in patients with severe organ or life-threatening EGPA however this cannot be confirmed 
as these patients were excluded from the pivotal study and there is no clinical data. The applicant 
justified that their exclusion was due to logistics more so than a safety concern as there are multiple 
definitions of severity of EGPA and organ- or life threatening EGPA. The CHMP considered that the 
applicant did not provide a satisfactory clinical rationale and detailed discussion as to why the safety 
profile of mepolizumab in patients with severe organ and life threatening EGPA is not expected to be 
different to the patient population included in the pivotal study. There was also no justification as to 
whether this excluded subgroup may not need additional monitoring if they were to receive 
mepolizumab. Given how clinically unstable this subgroup is and the fact that they also can receive 
cyclophosphamide (which was prohibited from the pivotal study), their exclusion from the pivotal study 
has been captured in the PI for HCPs and the specific exclusion criteria definition that was used for 
study MEA115921 highlighted. The lack of information in these patients has been included in the SmPC 
section 4.4. Additionally, the type of concomitant medication allowed in the study and that 
cyclophosphamide were not allowed is also added in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Additionally, the RMP is updated to reflect that the safety profile of this important subgroup has not 
been characterised by the applicant as they were excluded from the pivotal study. Therefore, patients 
with organ and life threatening EGPA is captured RMP as missing information. The applicant was also 
requested to monitor this subgroup via routine pharmacovigilance as well as closely monitor it in future 
PSURs. 
The 2 SAEs that occurred only in the mepolizumab arm by SOC were gastrointestinal disorder 
(abdominal pain) and MSK disorders (back pain). Both of these are already captured in the labelling as 
ADRs. There were no SAEs that occurred in the mepolizumab arm at a higher frequency compared to 
the placebo arm. Of the 11 non-fatal SAEs that were reported in the mepolizumab arm, 3 were 
considered drug related by the investigator: urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, and 
hypersensitivity. It is noted that most of the non-fatal SAEs had resolved in both arms. 1/11 of the 
non-fatal SAEs let to treatment withdrawal in the mepolizumab arm, severe hypersensitivity which 
resolved. 
SAEs were reported in 35% of participants in the LAP (MEA116841) which is a higher rate than the 
pivotal study (18%). The applicant described how the exposure in the LAP is longer than the pivotal 
study (299.21 v 66.68 subject years). After adjusting for exposure, the AEs were similar or lower. 
Deaths: One subject in the mepolizumab group had a fatal cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischaemia 
with stenosis in the LAD coronary artery which was not considered to be related to study treatment by 
the investigator. This patient, a 46-year old male, had a background history of CAD and SVT. Of note, 
alterations in cardiac safety is already listed as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
In the LAP program, a 65 year -old male patient with past medical history of hypertension, atrial flutter 
and diabetes mellitus died following worsening shortness of breath, hypoxaemia and asystole with a 
fatal outcome. The death certificate lists the underlying disease as the cause of death.

Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AESIs listed are captured in the current version of the RMP as safety concerns: systemic reaction 
including anaphylaxis, alterations in immune response (malignancies) and cardiovascular safety. 
Hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions are also listed as a warning in the product 
information. The overall risk of AESIs of systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions, local site 
reactions, infections, malignancies, CV disorders and immunogenicity is low. In total, 6% of patients 
experienced systemic (allergic and non-allergic) reactions in the group receiving 300 mg of 
mepolizumab as opposed to 1% in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were 
reported by 4% of patients in the group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and 1% of patients in the 
placebo group. Systemic non-allergic reactions (Angioedema) were reported by 1 (1%) subject in the 
group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and no patients in the placebo group. 
The development of ADAs against mepolizumab was low and did not warrant treatment discontinuation 
or specific therapeutic management/intervention. There were no severe systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions reported for patients with anti-mepolizumab antibodies. There was no association between 
hypersensitivity type reactions or injection site reactions and presence of ADA. The presence of ADA 
therefore had a minimal effect on patients with EGPA. Injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, 
swelling) occurred at a rate of 15% in patients receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab compared with 13% 
in patients receiving placebo. 
Opportunistic infections occurred at a higher frequency in the mepolizumab group however these 
resolved with continued study treatment. All were non-serious and 1 herpes zoster event was 
considered related to the treatment by the investigator. 
Non-clinical, clinical and post-marketing experience to date do not support a role for mepolizumab in 
the development of malignancies. The most frequently reported malignancies are those common in the 
general population with no specific pattern noted in the other types of malignancies reported. There 
were no malignancies and 1 neoplasm reported in the mepolizumab arm of the pivotal study. However, 
in the LAP neoplasms were reported in 9% and malignancies in 4% of participants. 2 of the 
malignancies were considered related to mepolizumab: colon cancer (led to treatment discontinuation) 
and renal cell carcinoma (did not lead to discontinuation). Malignancies are being assessed regularly in 
the PSURs. There is no EGPA paediatric data presented. Malignancies are already captured in the RMP 
as important potential risks which will continue to be closely monitored during PSURs. Based on the 
results from the LAP, this is strongly supported Neoplasms and malignancies are being evaluated in the 
mepolizumab clinical program. To date, there is no evidence of mepolizumab effect on neoplasms or 
malignancies in clinical studies in any indication or age group. 
In relation to cardiovascular safety, based on the available clinical data to date, the incidence of 
cardiovascular events with mepolizumab is similar to placebo. No additional pharmacovigilance 
activities are planned to investigate the potential risk of cardiovascular events, and the product 
information contains no specific clinical actions to minimise the risk. There were no alterations in ECG 
findings presented in the pivotal to suggest a specific concern for patients with EGPA and the AEs 
reported as SOC cardiac disorder and SOC investigations supports this. However, alterations in CV 
safety have been maintained in the safety specification as an important potential risk of the RMP and 
will continue to be monitored carefully. Additionally, reviewing the cardiac safety data from the LAP, 
cardiac disorders as an SOC occurred in 12% of participants for study MEA116841 compared to 6% in 
the mepolizumab arm of the pivotal study. 7% of these were serious compared to 1% in the 
mepolizumab and serious CVT AEs were reported for 9% compared to 3% in the pivotal study. Protocol 
or pre specified CV events occurred in 11 patients in MEA116841 in the LAP compared to 2 participants 
in the pivotal study. The safety profile of mepolizumab in the LAP including for cardiac disorders,

serious cardiac disorders, serious CVT/ischemic events was similar to that in MEA115921, with no new 
safety issues identified.  
EGPA Paediatric indication 
As previously mentioned, a clinical programme for paediatric EGPA was not considered feasible and 
instead, a full extrapolation approach without any clinical data in the paediatric population with EGPA 
of the efficacy and safety data from the single pivotal Phase III adult EGPA study was proposed, to 
support a paediatric indication in the 6 to 17 years age group. The paediatric clinical development plan 
discussed during CHMP scientific advice procedure in 2015 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/817315/2015) and an 
agreed PIP: EMEA-000069-PIP04-13-M02 detailing the 4 extrapolation, modelling and simulation 
studies. It was highlighted to the applicant that a clinical data registry may be required post approval 
to validate the extrapolation strategy given the concerns regarding difference in adult versus children 
EGPA disease state and the absence of blood eosinophil reduction response relationship in adults. 
Full extrapolation of mepolizumab efficacy and safety from adults to paediatrics (6 to 17 years) with 
EGPA was agreed by PDCO on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
considerable overlap in clinical presentation of the disease between these two populations, 
consistency in pathology and therapeutic approach, 
consistency of mepolizumab mechanism of action, 
relevance of the adult clinical endpoints for both efficacy (accrued remission, durability of 
remission, reduction in EGPA relapses and OCS dose) and safety to the paediatric population 6 
to 17 years. 
The applicant provided a summary of integrated safety of mepolizumab in paediatric subjects which 
included a total of 173 paediatric subjects that had received at least 1 dose of mepolizumab in the 
MAH-sponsored studies. While a paediatric EGPA programme was considered unfeasible by the 
applicant, it must be noted that there are 36 paediatric patients with HES included from 3 studies (the 
HES extended access programmes n=28, study 200622 n=4 and study 205203 n=4) This condition is 
equally as rare as EGPA with an orphan disease status. 
Safety was part of the key steps of the extrapolation strategy with the following rationale: 
“Assumption that the safety profile in the paediatric population (6 to 17 years) with EGPA is expected 
to be consistent with the safety profile in adults with EGPA”.  
1) 
The safety profile observed in the Phase III adult EGPA study is similar to that observed in the 
severe asthma clinical programme.  
2) 
No unique safety concerns were identified following mepolizumab treatment in children or 
adolescents included in the severe asthma clinical programme, nor in paediatric subjects with 
eosinophilic oesophagitis (who received IV doses up to 10 mg/kg), nor in the EAP for HES.  
Therefore, the safety profile in children and in adolescent patients with EGPA was anticipated to be 
similar to that in adult patients with EGPA. 
The proposed indication, posology and safety in EGPA children aged 6 years and older supported by 
modelling and simulation data. This was based on pharmacokinetics in other eosinophilic diseases and 
are expected to be consistent with those observed in children with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
However, EGPA is a multisystem disease and therefore it should be highlighted that safety data 
between these different paediatric populations could be considered incomparable as vasculitis is not a 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 128/142 
 
 
 
 
feature of eosinophilic asthma. There is more lung involvement and pulmonary infiltrates in children 
compared to adults while less renal involvement was noted. It is acknowledged that these results are 
based on analysis of published literature and different sources, albeit limited. The applicant stated that 
children presenting with predominantly lung or cardiac involvement are not expected to respond 
differently, or sub-optimally, to treatment because the heart and lungs are highly vascularised organs, 
mepolizumab will distribute adequately to these organs. Additionally, the applicant described that 
higher % of cardiac involvement occurring in children compared to adults may be the reason for a 
higher mortality.   
Safety data from other paediatric populations are considered supportive in particular the approved 
asthma indication regarding exposure to 100mg dose and data from the HES population extended 
access programme. Of note a higher incidence of deaths in patients with HES is also discussed during 
the parallel assessment of mepolizumab in HES patients.  
While the rarity of EGPA in children is acknowledged, there are uncertainties for example related to the 
differences in clinical manifestations of adults and children as described above and the lack of safety 
data available in children, while Nucala is intended for long term treatment. However, while 
extrapolation of safety data could be acknowledged and finally agreeable, the CHMP considered that 
additional specific post-marketing measures should be proposed given the rarity in children. Therefore, 
the CHMP requests that a safety and efficacy study in children aged 6 – 17 years with EGPA is carried 
out taking into account the following uncertainties in the post marketing setting: 
(i) Immunogenicity and carcinogenicity: although there is neither preclinical nor clinical evidence of 
these serious adverse events, these are two especially relevant conditions that have to be evaluated in 
children at long term. 
(ii) Potential effects in growth and organ maturation. 
(iii) Respiratory and cardiac involvement: analysed through a double perspective, efficacy and safety. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, taking into consideration the available safety data for mepolizumab to date and the new safety 
data presented in this dossier, the safety profile is considered acceptable in adults with EGPA. There are 
uncertainties in relation to the safety in the paediatric population which are now considered satisfactorily 
addressed with a post-authorisation study. Therefore, the safety assessment for mepolizumab for both 
adults & children is considered positive considering the safety profile in the paediatric population will be 
further characterised in the post authorisation setting through a category 3 study (RMP). 
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.  
Nucala is being approved for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), Hypereosinophilic 
Syndrome (HES) and Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) indication. As data in patients 
are limited, the safety profile in EGPA remains to be further characterised in the post marketing setting 
and will need to be closely monitored. Therefore, the PRAC/CHMP considered that an increase in PSUR 
frequency is warranted to monitor adequately the safety profile of mepolizumab in the new patient 
populations, mainly for the indication EPGA. The PSUR frequency is therefore increased to 6 monthly-

basis. The MAH should plan at least a further 6-month DLP period after the next December 2021 
submission. 
Based on the above considerations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the 
EURD list for mepolizumab needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product 
should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 23 September 2021.  
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH was requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.2 is acceptable.

2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
limited changes introduced in the PI in this application. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
EGPA, also referred to as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), is a rare systemic vasculitis, predominantly 
affecting small-sized vessels and medium sized arteries and may involve multiple organs including 
lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. 
Most patients have general symptoms such as fever or weight loss but pulmonary manifestations 
represent the core clinical features of CSS. Almost all patients have asthma, with transient and patchy 
pulmonary infiltrates also occurring in up to two-thirds of patients. Other organs or tissues involved in 
the disease include sinuses (75% of patients; either as a manifestation of allergic or of granulomatous 
inflammation), nervous system (e.g., mononeuritis multiplex in up to 76% of patients), skin (50% of 
patients; nodules, papules or vasculitis), heart (10-49%), gastrointestinal tract (33%) and kidney 
(25%) (Keogh, 2006; Holle, 2009; Vaglio, 2012). The clinical manifestations of heart involvement, 
which is associated with a poor prognosis, range from cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, and 
myocardial infarction to valvular and pericardial disease. Renal involvement typically manifests as a 
pauci-immune, focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, whereas 
eosinophilic or granulomatous inflammation of the kidney is a rare finding in CSS. Other organs may 
also be involved in CSS, and the condition is associated with thromboembolic events. In addition to the 
clinical manifestations described above, laboratory abnormalities are also commonly observed. The 
hallmark is leukocytosis with prominent eosinophilia, with many patients having absolute eosinophilic 
counts greater than 1500 cells/mm3. Anaemia of chronic disease is also often present, and 
antineutrophil cystoplasmic antibodies have been observed in approximately 40% of patients (Sinico, 
2005).

Page 133/142 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current approach to the management of EGPA is based on reduction of active inflammation, 
suppression of the immune response, and treatment of disease-specific and/or treatment-related 
complications. Corticosteroid therapy is the cornerstone therapy for the treatment of both poor- and 
good-prognosis EGPA patients, approved in few EU countries for EGPA. However, use of 
corticosteroids, particularly longer-term, is associated with significant side effects, including weight 
gain, osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia, depression and increased risk of infection, which can limit the 
benefits [Poetker, 2010]. Furthermore, although remission can be achieved in a proportion of patients 
with corticosteroid therapy alone, the addition of more potent immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., 
azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil) to maintain remission is commonly required. For 
poor-prognosis patients, cytotoxic therapy such as cyclophosphamide (CYC) is necessary for induction 
of remission with a switch to less toxic immunosuppressant therapy, e.g., azathioprine or 
methotrexate, for maintenance of remission. While immunosuppressives are often used for improved 
control of EGPA, they are also associated with significant side effects including cytopenia, 
hepatotoxicity, and major infections such as bacterial pneumonias, herpes zoster recurrences, 
opportunistic infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant submitted one pivotal study (MEA115921) supporting the use of mepolizumab in adult 
patients with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA). This was a double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the 
treatment of relapsing or refractory EGPA in subjects on stable oral corticosteroid therapy 
(prednisone/prednisolone ≥7.5 to ≤50 mg/day) with or without concomitant stable 
immunosuppressant therapy excluding cyclophosphamide. Other background standard of care therapy 
was allowed during the study. The study had three consecutive periods: the screening/run-in period 
(1-4 weeks), the study treatment period (52 weeks), and the follow-up period (8 weeks).  
In the study, there were two co-primary endpoints, both investigating the effect of mepolizumab on 
remission.  
The first co-primary endpoint was the assessment of total accrued duration of remission reported as 
proportion of subjects who achieved remission in the following categories: Zero; >0 to <12 weeks; 12 
to <24 weeks; 24 to <36 weeks; or ≥36 weeks. The second co-primary endpoint was the proportion of 
subjects who were in remission at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study treatment period. 
The applicant is requesting an approval also for the use in paediatric population. The prevalence of 
paediatric EGPA is very low, with approximately 100 cases identified in the literature worldwide 
between 1951 and 2020. A clinical programme for paediatric EGPA was not considered feasible and, 
instead, a full extrapolation approach (i.e. extrapolation without any clinical data in the paediatric 
population with EGPA) was proposed by the applicant.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the study, the two co-primary efficacy endpoints were met. Adult subjects treated with 
mepolizumab achieved a significantly greater accrued time in remission (BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 
mg/day) over the 52-week treatment period compared with subjects who received placebo (Odds ratio 
(mepolizumab/placebo) was 5.91, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value <0.001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 134/142 
 
 
 
In addition, a significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved remission 
(BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study compared with subjects 
who received placebo (Odds ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) was 16.74, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value 
<0.001). Over the 52-week treatment period, fewer subjects treated with mepolizumab (56%) had 
EGPA relapses compared with subjects who received placebo (82%) and the number of relapse events 
was lower with mepolizumab (88 events) compared with placebo (154 events). Subjects treated with 
mepolizumab had a 50% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving 
placebo (p<0.001). 
It is highlighted that OCS dose reduction is a very important treatment goal in patients with EGPA. 
Some reduction in the OCS dose was possible in the majority of patients treated with mepolizumab. 
Median reductions from baseline were greater in the mepolizumab group (-1.90 to -7.50 mg/day) 
compared with the placebo group (-0.11 to -2.50 mg/day). In addition, subjects treated with 
mepolizumab had a lower average daily OCS dose during Weeks 48 to 52 compared with subjects who 
received placebo (p<0.001). In the mepolizumab group, 12 subjects (18%) were able to taper off OCS 
completely compared with 2 subjects (3%) in the placebo group. 
Further, there was less relapses in patients treated with mepolizumab. Over the 52-week treatment 
period, fewer subjects treated with mepolizumab (56%) had EGPA relapses compared with subjects 
who received placebo (82%) and the number of relapse events was lower with mepolizumab (88 
events) compared with placebo (154 events). Subjects treated with mepolizumab had a 50% reduction 
in annualized relapse rate compared with subjects receiving placebo (p<0.001). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It can be agreed that mepolizumab could be a valid treatment option in paediatric patients however, 
due to the apparent differences in the course of the disease in children, there are uncertainties 
whether children aged 6 and older respond to the treatment with mepolizumab in the same way as 
adults. Therefore, the full extrapolation approach may be not entirely appropriate when considering the 
similarity of the disease between the adult and the paediatric EGPA populations.  
The differences in the clinical manifestations of EGPA between adults and children as a heart and lung 
involvement and mortality appear to be higher in childhood onset versus adult onset EGPA. Further, 
paediatric patients appeared less likely to have musculoskeletal, renal or peripheral nervous system 
disease, but more likely to have GI or skin involvement compared with adult patients. Of note, it needs 
to be highlighted that the data on paediatric EGPA are extremely limited and therefore the differences 
as compared to the adults EGPA may not be fully understood.  
It is agreed with the applicant that due to extreme rarity of EGPA in children is not feasible to perform 
a RCT in paediatric patients however, efficacy and safety data on the use in children should be 
collected in the postmarking setting.  
In the adult study, there was no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for 
Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) used for recording organ damage. Based on the available data, it 
cannot be concluded that the treatment with mepolizumab is preventing development of organ 
damage. Therefore, information that the effect on prevention of development of organ damage or 
improvement of survival was not shown in the pivotal study has been added for the prescriber in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. It is likely that the reason for such inconclusive results in relation to the 
development of organ damage in this study may be due to an insufficiently long observation period. 
The applicant clarified that a link between the reduction of relapses and improved survival and/or 
prevention of organ damage is suggested and highly plausible. Summarizing current literature, this link 
is complex and, at least in part impacted by the natural history of the disease, applied 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 135/142 
 
 
 
immunosuppressive/ immune modulator therapy as well as early diagnosis of asymptomatic critical 
disease features, thus not fully understood. 
Subjects with organ threatening or life-threatening EGPA were excluded from the study and no data is 
available in these patients. The following statement was added to the SmPC for the prescriber upon 
request from the CHMP: “Nucala has not been studied in patients with organ threatening or life-
threatening manifestations of EGPA. Clinical judgement should be used when considering whether 
mepolizumab treatment should be discontinued during a relapse or in case of development of life-
threatening EGPA”.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AEs presented in general are overall expected with the condition or are already captured in the 
product information and the RMP in particular hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions, 
infections, neck pain, headache and respiratory disorders. There were no obvious emerging safety 
signals from either the pivotal study or the long-term access programme. The safety profile of 
mepolizumab in the long-term access programme was similar to that in MEA115921, with no new 
safety issues identified. 
No treatment-related trends or clinically significant findings were observed in laboratory tests, vital 
sign assessments, or ECGs. No hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities of concern were reported during 
the study and the liver chemistry stopping and follow up criteria is noted in the protocol.  
In the pivotal study, SAEs were reported less frequently in the mepolizumab arm compared with 
placebo, with asthma, influenza, and pneumonia being the most commonly reported. 
The 2 SAEs that occurred only in the mepolizumab arm by SOC were gastrointestinal disorder 
(abdominal pain) and musculoskeletal disorders (back pain). Both of these are already captured in the 
labelling as ADRs. No SAEs occurred in the mepolizumab arm at a higher frequency compared to the 
placebo arm. Of the 11 non-fatal SAEs that were reported in the mepolizumab arm, 3 were considered 
drug related by the investigator: urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, and hypersensitivity. It is 
noted that most of the non-fatal SAEs had resolved in both arms and 1/11 of the non-fatal SAEs 
(severe hypersensitivity) let to treatment withdrawal in the mepolizumab arm but resolved. 
In relation to cardiovascular safety, it is noted that there were more cardiac disorders (any event) 
noted in the placebo arm (n=6, 9%) versus (n=4, 6%) in the mepolizumab arm. No additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are planned to investigate the potential risk of cardiovascular events, and 
the product information contains no specific clinical actions to minimise the risk. There were no 
alterations in ECG findings to suggest a specific concern for EGPA patients. Alterations in CV safety 
have been maintained in the safety specification of the RMP as per CHMP request and will continue to 
be monitored carefully. 
Neoplasms and malignancies are being assessed as part of the clinical development programme and 
monitored in the post approval setting. To date, there is no evidence of mepolizumab effect on 
neoplasms or malignancies in clinical studies in any indication or age group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are uncertainties regarding safety in the paediatric indication as no clinical data are available.  
While supportive, there are limitations with using extrapolation data from the adult population and 
other paediatric indications. Despite the known safety profile in the eosinophilic asthma population, it 
Assessment report  
EMA/560927/2021  
Page 136/142 
 
 
 
must be acknowledged that patients with EGPA are a different patient population given the 
multisystem nature of the condition compared eosinophilic asthma.  
There are also differences in the clinical manifestations of EGPA depending on age between adults and 
children. Heart and lung involvement and mortality appear to be higher in childhood onset which 
highlights the uncertainty with extrapolation to both adults and other paediatric indications. 
Additionally, the long-term exposure of the product in this population and the adult population remain 
to be fully established and will need to be further characterised in the post approval setting. To this 
end, a descriptive safety and efficacy study in children aged 6 – 17 years with EGPA has been added in 
the RMP (category 3 study).  
Patients with organ and life threatening EGPA were excluded from the pivotal study which is a 
limitation as the product is not contraindicated in these patients. A warning has been introduced in the 
SmPC which was considered necessary to inform prescribers.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Adult subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved a significantly greater accrued time in remission 
(BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) over the 52-week treatment period compared with subjects who 
received placebo (Odds ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) was 5.91, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value <0.001). 
In addition, a significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with mepolizumab achieved remission 
(BVAS=0 and OCS dose ≤4 mg/day) at both Weeks 36 and 48 of the study compared with subjects 
who received placebo (Odds ratio (mepolizumab/placebo) was 16.74, 95% CI 2.68, 13.03, p-value 
<0.001). 
OCS Dose Reduction is a very important treatment goal in patients with EGPA. Median OCS dose 
reductions from baseline were greater in the mepolizumab group (-1.90 to -7.50 mg/day) compared 
with the placebo group (-0.11 to -2.50 mg/day).  In addition, subjects treated with mepolizumab had a 
lower average daily OCS dose during Weeks 48 to 52 compared with subjects who received placebo 
(p<0.001) and 12 subjects (18%) were able to taper off OCS completely in the mepolizumab group 
compared with 2 subjects (3%) in the placebo group. 
Further, there was less relapses in patients treated with mepolizumab.  
There was no statistically significant differences between the treatment group for vasculitis damage 
index (VDI) is used for recording organ damage. Therefore, based on the available data it cannot be 
concluded that the treatment with mepolizumab is preventing development of organ damage.  
Subjects with organ threatening or life-threatening EGPA were excluded from the study and warning 
was added to the SmPC.  
Paediatric population 
It can be agreed that mepolizumab could be a valid treatment option in paediatric patients however, 
due to the apparent differences in the course of the disease in children (e.g. heart and lung 
involvement and mortality appear to be higher in childhood onset versus adult onset EGPA), there are 
uncertainties whether children aged 6 and older respond to the treatment with mepolizumab in the 
same way as adults. Further, it needs to be highlighted that the data on paediatric EGPA are extremely 
limited and therefore the differences as compared to the adults EGPA may not be fully understood.  
Overall considering available data and limitations, the CHMP considered that the data are sufficient to 
support an approval in children with EGPA  from 6 years of age but requested the MAH to perform a 
post approval study  to  collect safety and efficacy  data on the use in children from 6 to 17 years old 
in the postmarking setting. Final results will be provided by 1Q 2031. The protocol will be submitted by 
February 2022. 
Overall, the toxicities presented from the pivotal adult patient study did not demonstrate new adverse 
events associated with mepolizumab arm and there does not appear to be any AEs emerging specific 
for EGPA. However, for reasons outlined above, both paediatric patients with EGPA and patients with 
organ- or life-threatening disease have been added as missing information in the summary of safety 
concerns in the RMP. The product information was also updated to reflect that patients with organ- or 
life-threatening disease were excluded from the pivotal EGPA studies.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit risk for Nucala in the treatment of both adults and children aged 6-17 years with 
relapsing-remitting or refractory EGPA is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH has requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication from 10 to 11 years. The CHMP 
agreed that a significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy and on a major contribution to 
patient care has been demonstrated (see Appendix1). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nucala is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes:

C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Variation C.1.6.a: Extension of indication to include Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis 
(EGPA) to Nucala (mepolizumab); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 7.2 of the RMP has also 
been approved.  
2 Variations type I B.11.e.5.a.2:  
Addition of a new pack size of 9x100mg/ml multipack for pre-filled pens for Nucala 100 mg/ml solution 
for injection and another pack size of 9x100mg/ml multipack for pre-filled syringes for Nucala 
100 mg/ml solution for injection. As a consequence, sections 6.5 and 8 of SmPC and section 6 of the 
PL are updated accordingly. Annex IIIA is also being updated to include information relating to the new 
pack sizes.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling, 
Package Leaflet and Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA, IIIB and 
A and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/300/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that Nucala in the new therapeutic 
indication brings a significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy and on a major contribution to 
patient care (see appendix 1).  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

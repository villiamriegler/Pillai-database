risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through  the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor

with regard to the side effect hyperglycaemia (amlodipine

In the PIL section 2, there is a different wording of 
telmisartan mono products  compared to the

Besides, editorial changes are proposed  for Twynsta, 
Onduarp, Micardis, MicardisPlus,  Pritor, PritorPlus, 
Kinzalmono and Kinzalkomb regarding  storage 
recommendations in Annex IIIA in bold characters  to bring 
them in line with the printing style on the actual, marketed

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list

variation application is submitted to update the relevant 
sections of SmPC and  PL according to a harmonised 
wording  concerning  the use of hydrochlorothiazide  in 
combination with angiotensin II receptor antagonists  during 
pregnancy  and breast-feeding as per the recommendation 
and wording  agreed by PhVWP and CHMP in June 2011. 
In particular, with this variation the MAH added information 
on the limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide  during 
pregnancy,  especially during  the first trimester. In addition 
the MAH added that hydrochlorothiazide  crosses  the 
placenta and its use during  the second and  third trimester 
may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause 
foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance  of 
electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia.  The updated of 
the SmPC includes that hydrochlorothiazide  should  not be 
used for essential hypertension  in pregnant  women except 
in rare situations where no other treatment could be used.

dual RAAS blockade and section 4.5 of the SPC to 
include information on the interaction with ramipril. 
Further, a minor change  has been made to section

telmisartan'. The Package Leaflet has been updated

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics  and 
Package Leaflet 
As a consequence  of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, hypotension,  syncope, hyperkalaemia, 
and changes  in renal function (including acute renal failure) 
have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if 
combining medicinal products  that affect this system. Dual 
blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (e.g. 
by adding an ACE-inhibitor to an angiotensin II receptor 
antagonist) is therefore not recommended in patients with 
already controlled blood pressure  and should be limited to 
individually defined cases with close monitoring of renal 
function. 
Inteaction with ramipril: 
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and 
ramipril led to an increase of up  to 2.5 fold in the AUC0-24 
and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance 
of this observation is not known. 
The term 'drug  ineffective' currently labelled as an adverse

All AIIRA agents  were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast  milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption  of low 
transport  according  to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better

trials (placebo or active controlled) meeting this pre-
requisite and which listed adverse events and reactions by 
individual patients (i.e. patient by patient basis) were 
identified and 9 clinical trials served as the basis for the 
frequency estimation of side effects of telmisartan + 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
Regarding SPC section 4.9 the information so far stated 
that "no data are available for telmisartan with regard  to 
overdose in humans". However, several mostly 
spontaneous  reports  of overdoses had been received by the

identified a signal of increased  risk of congenital 
malformations, particularly cardiac  defects after exposure 
to ACE inhibitors during  the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Since the role of confounding  factors such as diabetes and 
hypertension  cannot be accurately defined based on the 
available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors  is 
not demonstrated, even though data suggest  that such 
exposure cannot  be considered as safe and should  be 
avoided. 
There are fewer data regarding  the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists  (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered  that any conclusions  on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication  for the 2nd and 3rd 
trimester of pregnancy  remained, but a harmonised

"NSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory 
dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective 
NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic  and 
antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the 
antihypertensive effects of angiotensin  II antagonists. 
In some patients with compromised renal function (eg 
dehydrated  patients or elderly patients with compromised 
renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II 
antagonists  and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may 
result in further deterioration of renal function, including 
possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Therefore the combination should be administered with 
caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should  be 
adequately hydrated and consideration  shoul be given to 
monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant 
therapy and periodically thereafter." 
In addition, minor changes  have been introduced  in the 
wording  of the subsections  on "lithium", "medicinal 
products  that may increase potassium levels or induce 
hyperkalaemia", "alcohol and antidepressants. 
Regarding section 4.4, a number of cross-references  have 
been introduced, as well as the following sentence on 
fructose intolerance, in line with the Guideline on 
Excipients: 
Sorbitol: Patients with hereditary  problems of fructose 
intolerance should  not take MicardisPlus.

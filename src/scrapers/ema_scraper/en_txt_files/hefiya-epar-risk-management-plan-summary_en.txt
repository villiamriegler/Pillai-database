Summary of the risk management plan for Hefiya
(adalimumab)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Hefiya,  a 
biosimilar to Humira. The RMP details important risks of Hefiya, how these 
risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about 
these risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Hefiya  SmPC  and  Hefiya  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hefiya should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Hefiya should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment 
Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in 
updates of the RMP for Hefiya.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Hefiya is authorised for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis  (Polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  and  Enthesitis-related 
arthritis),  axial  spondyloarthritis  (Ankylosing  spondylitis  and  Axial 
spondyloarthritis  without  radiographic  evidence  of  AS),  Psoriatic  arthritis, 
Psoriasis,  Paediatric  plaque  psoriasis,  Hidradenitis  suppurativa  (HS), 
Crohn’s disease, Paediatric Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis, and 
Paediatric uveitis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains adalimumab 
as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  the  benefits  of  Hefiya  can  be 
found  in  the  respective  EPARs,  including  its  plain-language  summary, 
available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/hefiya
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  Hefiya  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks 
and the proposed studies for learning more about these risks, are outlined 
below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on 
correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and 
healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen 
so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the 
patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its 
risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
These  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. In addition to 
these  measures, 
is  collected 
continuously  and  analyzed  regularly,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that 
immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
information  about  adverse  reactions 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Hefiya is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Hefiya  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal 
product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as 
identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hefiya. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Serious infections
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Serious infections are listed in section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the 
Humira SmPC and considered to be an important identified 
risk of the reference product Humira. Serious infections are 
therefore considered as an important identified risk of Hefiya, 
a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization
measures
Serious infections were reported in both adult and pediatric 
subjects treated with TNF inhibitors and across all indications. 
Patients concomitantly treated with other 
immunosuppressant medicines are at increased risk as well 
as a past medical history of serious infections, glucocorticoid 
dose, and older age (> 65 years). These are important 
independent predictors of serious infection risks in patients 
treated with TNF inhibitors. Patients with RA had a 2-fold 
increased adjusted risk of hospitalized infections compared to 
those without RA concluded from a retrospective cohort. 
Current prednisone use > 7.5 mg/day, previous infections 
and previous hospitalized infections increased the risk of 
hospitalized infections as well as probably RA disease activity.

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Malignancies (including lymphoma, HSTCL, leukemia, NMSC, 
melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and other malignancies) 
are listed in section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions and 
section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the Humira SmPC and are 
considered to be an important identified risk of the reference 
product Humira. Malignancies are therefore considered as an 
important identified risk of Hefiya, a biosimilar to Humira.
Lymphoma
For Hodgkin lymphoma age at diagnosis is a strong risk factor 
for survival, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma gender with a higher 
survival rate in males.
The most commonly used prognostic system for Hodgkin 
lymphoma is the International Prognostic System, which uses 
the following factors: serum albumin less than 4 g/dL, 
hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dL, male sex, age ≥45, stage IV 
disease, WBC count >15,000/µL, absolute lymphocyte count 
<600/µL or <8% of the total WBC count or both.
HSTCL
A moderate risk factor is immune-mediated disease, 
concomitant azathioprine, and possibly TNF inhibitor 
treatment.
Leukemia
General risk factors are gender and age. Men are more likely 
to develop CML, CLL and AML than women. The risk of most 
leukemias, with the exception of ALL, typically increases with 
age.
Genetics: For most leukemias there is no clear link. First 
degree relatives of CLL patients or identical twins of AML or 
ALL patients are at increased risk.
Lifestyle: Smoking cigarettes increase risks for AML.
Exposures: High-energy radiation, long term exposure to 
chemicals such as pesticides or industrial chemicals like 
benzene are considered a risk.
Previous treatment: Certain types of chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy for other cancers are considered leukemia 
risk factors.
NMSC
BCC: white skin type, male sex, sunlight exposure - patient 
geographic location affects the risk of developing skin cancer. 
A latency period of 20-50 years is typical between the time of 
ultraviolet damage and clinical onset of cancer, gene 
mutations, X-ray, immunosuppressed patients, previous non-
melanoma skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma: Patient related risk factors are 
organ transplantation, hematologic malignancy, long-term 
immunosuppressive therapy, HIV infection or AIDS.
Merkel cell carcinoma
The following factors are associated with increased risks: 
Whites / fair skin, UV radiation, age, long-term 
immunosuppression (risk 15 times increased compared to 
general population), RA, autoimmune disorders, organ 
transplantation, HIV, arsenic exposure, Merkel cell 
polyomavirus.
Melanoma
Important tumor specific risk factors are depth of invasion, 
the presence or absence of ulceration, and the nodal status at 
diagnosis. Patient factors are white skin, age, sun exposure.
TNF seems to be a negative prognostic factor in melanoma 
surgery and correlates with chemotherapy resistance. 
However, high intra-tumor levels of TNF might be beneficial 
for immunotherapy.
Other malignancies
No specific risk groups or risk factors are known within the 
population of patients treated with adalimumab.

identified risk of the reference product Humira. Demyelinating 
disorders are therefore considered as an important identified 
risk of Hefiya, a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Potential risk factors may include subjects with pre-existing 
or recent onset central demyelinating disorders.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization
measures
BCG disease following live BCG vaccination in infants with in 
utero exposure to Humira is considered to be an important 
identified risk of the reference product Humira and is 
therefore considered as an important identified risk of Hefiya, 
a biosimilar to Humira.
Adalimumab treatment may be required to maintain disease 
stability for women during pregnancy. Adalimumab may cross 
the placenta, leading to in-utero exposure, impairing the 
development of the immune system. A prolonged half-life of 
adalimumab in infants may prolong this exposure, and hence 
lead to a compromised immunsesystem.
Therefore, the risk is potentially related to the maternal dose 
of adalimumab and how late into the pregnancy adalimumab 
treatment continued. 
The practice for BCG vaccine of neonates also differs across 
countries depending on national guidelines and the risk of TB 
exposure for the infant.

Important potential risk: Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Evidence for linking the

Risk factors and risk 
groups
PML mainly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, and 
isolated cases were described in association with biologic 
therapy. PML is considered to be an important potential risk 
of the reference product Humira and is therefore considered 
as an important potential risk of Hefiya, a biosimilar to 
Humira.
The development of PML has been most extensively studied 
with natalizumab (1.78 per 1000 for patients treated more 
than 2 years). 
Contributors to the risk to develop PML under natalizumab, 
rituximab or efalizumab and possibly also infliximab are the 
combined application and sequential application of 
immunomodulatory/ immunosuppressive compounds and the 
duration and exposure of treatment.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
It is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk 
for adenocarcinoma of the colon. Adenocarcinoma of colon in 
UC patients is considered to be an important potential risk of 
the reference product Humira and is therefore considered to 
be an important potential risk of Hefiya, a biosimilar to 
Humira.
Risk factors for colorectal cancer in UC patients include young 
age at diagnosis, longer duration, greater anatomical extent 
of colonic involvement, the degree of inflammation, family 
history of colorectal cancer, and presence of primary 
sclerosing cholangitis.
Risk minimization
measures
Routine risk minimization measures:
Guidance is provided in the section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use of the SmPC, where it is recommended 
that all patients with UC who are at increased risk for 
dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for example, patients with 
long-standing UC or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who 
had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be 
screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and 
throughout their disease course.

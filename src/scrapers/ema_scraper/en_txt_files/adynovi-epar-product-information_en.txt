CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.  
Previously untreated patients 
The safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  
A field study has indicated that plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic 
substrate assay or a one stage clotting assay routinely used in clinical laboratories. 
Posology  
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO (World Health Organization) concentrate standard for factor VIII products. 
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or 
preferably in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment  
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required 
dose is determined using the following formula: 
Required international units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period.  
The following Table 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections 
every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 day, 
until the bleeding episode, as 
indicated by pain, is resolved or 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency (see sections 5.1, 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. 
Currently available data in patients below 12 years are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels 
and individual bleeding tendency (see sections 5.1, 5.2).  
Method of administration  
ADYNOVI is for intravenous use.  
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to the parent molecule octocog alfa or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1.  
Known allergic reaction to mouse or hamster protein. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity  
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADYNOVI. 
The medicinal product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact 
their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including 
hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  
Inhibitors  
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII pro-coagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 
exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon.  
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) 
No clinical data for use of ADYNOVI in ITI are available. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk.

Catheter-related complications in treatment 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Excipient related considerations 
This medicinal product contains up to 12.42 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.62% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Depending on the body weight and 
posology, the patient could receive more than one vial. This should be taken into consideration by 
patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that ADYNOVI is administered to a patient, the name and 
batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch 
of the medicinal product. 
Paediatric population  
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation 
only if clearly indicated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
injection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADYNOVI. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted (see section 5.1). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The safety of ADYNOVI was evaluated in 365 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A 
(factor VIII less than 1% of normal), who received at least one dose of ADYNOVI in 6 completed 
multi-centre, prospective, open label clinical trials and 1 ongoing clinical trial.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and 
von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophilic 
patient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII 
acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. 
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the 
plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Rurioctocog alfa pegol, is a pegylated recombinant human factor VIII with an extended half-life. 
Rurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of octocog alfa consisting of 2 332 amino acids with 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent (MW 20 kDa). The therapeutic activity of rurioctocog alfa pegol is 
derived from octocog alfa, which is produced by recombinant DNA technology from a Chinese 
hamster ovary cell line. Octocog alfa is then covalently conjugated with the PEG reagent. The PEG 
moiety is conjugated to octocog alfa to increase the plasma half-life.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a pivotal multi-centre, 
open-label, prospective clinical trial that compared the efficacy of a twice weekly prophylactic 
treatment regimen to on-demand treatment and determined haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of 
bleeding episodes. A total of 137 male PTPs (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A 
received at least one infusion with ADYNOVI. Twenty-five of the 137 subjects were adolescents 
(12 to less than 18 years of age). 
Immunogenicity 
None of the subjects who participated in one or more of 6 completed clinical trials in previously 
treated patients (PTPs) developed persistent neutralizing (inhibitory) antibodies against FVIII of ≥ 0.6 
BU/mL (based on the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay). One patient developed a 
transient FVIII inhibitor at the lowest limit of positivity (0.6 BU) during personalized prophylaxis 
targeting a FVIII level of 8-12%. 
From an ongoing study in previously untreated patients < 6 years with severe hemophilia A, 
preliminary reports on 9 cases of FVIII inhibitor development associated with treatment with 
ADYNOVI were received.  
Prophylactic treatment 
Subjects received either prophylactic treatment (n = 120) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 40-50 IU 
per kg twice weekly or on-demand treatment (n = 17) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 10-60 IU per kg 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for a 6-month period. The median dosing interval was 3.6 days and the mean dose (SD) 
was 48.7 (4.4) IU/kg. One hundred eighteen of 120 (98%) prophylaxis subjects remained on the 
starting recommended regimen without dose adjustment, and 2 subjects increased their dose 
to 60 IU/kg during prophylaxis due to bleeding in target joints.  
In the per-protocol population, i.e. dosed according to the protocol specific dosing requirements, a 
total of 101 subjects received a twice a week regimen in the prophylaxis arm, and 17 subjects were 
treated episodically in the on-demand arm. The median annualised bleed rate (ABR) in the on-demand 
treatment arm was 41.5 compared to 1.9 while on a twice a week prophylaxis regimen. The median 
joint ABR (Q1 ; Q3) in the on-demand arm was 38.1 (24.5 ; 44.6) compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.0) while on 
prophylaxis, and the median spontaneous ABR was 21.6 (11.2 ; 33.2) on the on-demand arm 
compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.2) while on prophylaxis. Results for the full-analysis population were similar 
to those for the per-protocol population. Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor 
concentrates and between different clinical trials. 
Forty out of 101 subjects (40%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) 
experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced no spontaneous 
bleeding episodes in the prophylaxis arm. All subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a bleeding 
episode, including a joint or spontaneous bleeding episode. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
A total of 518 bleeding episodes were treated with ADYNOVI in the per-protocol population. Of 
these, 361 bleeding episodes (n=17 subjects) occurred in the on-demand arm and 157 (n=61 subjects) 
occurred in the prophylaxis arm. The median dose per infusion to treat all bleeding episodes in the 
per-protocol population was 32.0 (Interquartile Range (IQR): 21.5) IU per kg. Overall, 95.9% of 
bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 to 2 infusions and 85.5% were controlled with 
only 1 infusion. Of the 518 bleeding episodes, 96.1% were rated excellent (full relief of pain and 
cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or good (definite pain relief and/or 
improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in their response to treatment with 
ADYNOVI. 
Paediatric population < 12 years of age 
A total of 66 PTPs with severe haemophilia A were dosed (32 subjects aged < 6 years and 34 subjects 
aged 6 to < 12 years) in the paediatric study. The prophylactic regimen was 40 to 60 IU/kg of 
ADYNOVI twice a week. The mean dose (SD) was 54.3 (6.3) IU/kg and the median frequency of 
infusions per week was 1.87. The median overall ABR was 2.0 (IQR: 3.9) for the 65 subjects in the 
per-protocol population and the median ABRs for spontaneous and joint bleeding episodes were 
both 0 (IQR: 1.9). Twenty four out of 65 subjects (37%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 47 out 
of 65 subjects (72%) experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 43 out of 65 subjects (66%) 
experienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes on prophylaxis. 
Of the 70 bleeding episodes observed during the paediatric study, 82.9% were controlled 
with 1 infusion and 91.4% were controlled with 1 or 2 infusions. Control of bleeding was rated 
excellent (full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or 
good (definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in 63 out 
of 70 (90.0%) bleeding episodes.  
Perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) 
A total of 21 major surgical procedures and 5 additional minor surgeries were performed and assessed 
in 21 unique subjects in the surgery study. For major surgeries, the preoperative loading dose ranged 
from 36 IU/kg to 109 IU/kg (median: 63 IU/kg); and postoperative total dose ranged from 186 IU/kg 
to 1 320 IU/kg (median: 490 IU/kg). The median total dose for major surgeries was 553 IU/kg 
(range: 248-1 394 IU/kg) and the median total dose of minor surgeries was 106 IU/kg (range: 76-
132 IU/kg). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent (blood loss less than or equal to that 
expected for the same type of procedure performed in a non-haemophilic patient, and required blood 
components for transfusions less than or similar to that expected in non-haemophilic population) for 
all 26 (21 major, 5 minor) procedures. The median (IQR) observed intraoperative blood loss (n = 14) 
was 10.0 (20.0) ml compared to the predicted average blood loss (n = 14) of 150.0 (140.0) ml for 
major orthopaedic surgeries. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with 
ADYNOVI in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of congenital 
factor VIII deficiency. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Long-term prophylaxis treatment in paediatric and adult subjects 
The long-term safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes 
was evaluated in 216 paediatric and adult PTPs with severe haemophilia A who had either previously 
participated in other ADYNOVI studies or were naïve to ADYNOVI. In the treated population, 
subjects received a fixed-dose twice-weekly regimen of 40 to 50 IU/kg if aged ≥ 12 years or of 40 to 
60 IU/kg if aged < 12 years. The dose was adjusted up to 80 IU/kg twice weekly if required to 
maintain FVIII trough levels of > 1%. Subjects that opted for a personalized (pharmacokinetically-
tailored) prophylactic regimen received doses up to 80 IU/kg per infusion that targeted FVIII trough 
levels of ≥ 3% at least twice weekly. ABR per prophylactic regimen, bleeding site and etiology are 
presented in Table 3.

Long-term haemostatic efficacy was evaluated in 910 bleeding episodes treated with ADYNOVI and 
was rated excellent or good in 88.5% of bleeding episodes. Across age categories and for both the 
fixed-dose and the PK-tailored dose regimen, >85% of bleed treatments were rated excellent or good. 
The majority of bleeding episodes were treated with one (74.0%) or two (15.4%) infusions. 
Personalized prophylaxis PROPEL clinical trial in adolescents and adult subjects 
The safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, open-label 
multi-centre study in 121 (115 randomized) adolescents (12-18 years old) and adult PTPs with severe 
haemophilia A for a 12-month treatment period. The study compared 2 PK-guided prophylactic dosing 
regimens of ADYNOVI that targeted Factor VIII trough levels of 1-3% dosed twice weekly (N=57) or 
8-12% dosed every other day (N=58), by assessing the proportions of subjects achieving a total ABR 
of 0 in the second 6-month study period. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The average prophylactic doses administered in the 1-3% and 8-12 % trough arms were 3 866.1 IU/kg 
per year [mean (SD) infusions/week = 2.3 (0.58)] and 7 532.8 IU/kg per year [(mean (SD) 
infusions/week = 3.6 (1.18)], respectively. After dose adjustment during the first 6-month period of 
prophylaxis, median trough levels in the second 6-month period (based on the one-stage clotting assay 
and calculated to the end of the planned infusion interval) ranged from 2.10 IU/dL to 3.00 IU/dL in the 
1-3% trough level arm and from 10.70 IU/dL to 11.70 IU/dL in the 8-12 % trough level arm, 
demonstrating that dosing in the 2 prophylaxis regimens was generally adequate to achieve and 
maintain the desired FVIII trough levels. 
The primary endpoint of the study, proportion of subjects who had a total ABR of 0 during the second 
6-month period, was not reached in the ITT patient population (p= 0.0545) but was reached in the per-

Per-protocol population = all subjects who completed the second 6 months of prophylactic treatment and had no major 
deviations from the protocol affecting the study results. 
Annualized bleeding rate determined by dividing the number of bleeds by observation period in years.  
A total of 242 bleeding episodes in 66 subjects were treated with ADYNOVI; 155 bleeds in 
40 subjects in the 1-3% trough level arm and 87 bleeds in 26 subjects in the 8-12% trough level arm. 
The majority of bleeds (86.0%, 208/242) were treated with 1 or 2 infusions; and bleed treatment at 
resolution of the bleeding episode was rated excellent or good in 84.7% (205/242) of bleeds. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a crossover study with octocog alfa 
in 26 subjects (18 adults and 8 adolescents) and in 22 subjects (16 adults and 6 adolescents) 
after 6 months of treatment with ADYNOVI. Plasma factor VIII activity was measured by the 
one stage clotting assay and chromogenic assay. 
ADYNOVI has an extended half-life of 1.4 to 1.5-fold compared to recombinant human coagulation 
factor VIII (octocog alfa) in the adolescent and adult population, as determined based on one stage 
clotting and chromogenic assays, respectively. An increase in AUC and a decrease in clearance as 
compared to the parent molecule, octocog alfa, were also observed. Incremental recovery was 
comparable with both products. The change in PK parameters was similar in both the adult and 
adolescent populations and between one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays. 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from 39 subjects less than 18 years of age (intent-to-treat 
analysis) are available for 14 children (2 to less than 6 years), 17 older children (6 to less 
than 12 years) and 8 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age). The half-life extension in the 
paediatric population was 1.3 to 1.5 fold using both the one stage clotting and chromogenic assays. 
The mean clearance (based on body weight) of ADYNOVI was higher and the mean half-life was 
lower in children less than 12 years of age than adults.  
A higher dose may be required in children less than 12 years of age, see section 4.2.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey, two animals showed vacuolation in the 
kidney in the mid dose group (350 IU/kg). The vacuolations did not recover after 2 weeks. The human 
relevance of kidney vacuolation observed in the preclinical study is unknown. 
Nonclinical data are limited to 1 month exposure and no studies in juvenile animals were conducted 
with ADYNOVI. Thus, it was not possible to conclude on the potential risks of PEG accumulation in 
various tissues/organs relevant for chronic use of ADYNOVI in the paediatric population.  
No studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity have been performed with 
ADYNOVI.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use 
solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.  
After reconstitution, the solution has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3. The osmolality is ≥ 380 mOsmol/kg. 
Preparation and reconstitution using the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device 
For reconstitution use only the solvent vial and the reconstitution device provided in the pack. 
1. 
Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the 
reconstitution procedure. 
Allow the vials of powder and solvent to reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C) 
before use. 
Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. 
Clean rubber stoppers with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry prior to use. 
Open the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device package by peeling away the lid, without touching the 
inside (Figure A). Do not remove the device from the package. 
Turn the package over. Press straight down to fully insert the clear plastic spike through the 
solvent vial stopper (Figure B).  
Grip the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow package at its edge and pull the package off the device 
(Figure C). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device. Do not touch 
the exposed purple plastic spike. 
Turn the system over so that the solvent vial is on top. Quickly insert the purple plastic spike 
fully into the powder vial stopper by pushing straight down (Figure D). The vacuum will draw 
the solvent into the powder vial. 
Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution.

3. 
4. 
Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device (Figure E). Do not draw air into 
the syringe. Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is 
recommended.  
Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the 
syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Figure F).  
Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously. If a patient is to 
receive more than one vial of ADYNOVI, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the 
same syringe.  
A separate BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device is required to reconstitute each vial of ADYNOVI with 
the solvent. 
Administer over a period of up to 5 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 ml per min).  
It is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the powder vial. 
Reconstitution with the BAXJECT III system 
Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister 
1. 
If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent 
vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room 
temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). 
2.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
3. 
Open the ADYNOVI blister by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from 
the blister. 
Place the powder vial on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Figure 1). The solvent vial 
has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. 
4. 
6. 
5.  With one hand holding the powder vial in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the 
solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down 
into the powder vial (Figure 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. 
Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved 
(Figure 3). Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted 
solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less 
than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from 
particles.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.  
Previously untreated patients 
The safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Treatment monitoring: 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  
A field study has indicated that plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic 
substrate assay or a one stage clotting assay routinely used in clinical laboratories. 
Posology  
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO (World Health Organization) concentrate standard for factor VIII products. 
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or 
preferably in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment  
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required 
dose is determined using the following formula: 
Required international units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period.  
The following Table 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 day, 
until the bleeding episode, as 
indicated by pain, is resolved or 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency (see sections 5.1, 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. 
Currently available data in patients below 12 years are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels 
and individual bleeding tendency (see sections 5.1, 5.2).  
Method of administration  
ADYNOVI is for intravenous use. 
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

The medicinal product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact 
their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including 
hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII pro-coagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the 
first 50 exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon.  
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) 
No clinical data for use of ADYNOVI in ITI are available. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications in treatment 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Excipient related considerations 
This medicinal product contains up to 12.42 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.62% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Depending on the body weight and 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posology, the patient could receive more than one vial. This should be taken into consideration by 
patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that ADYNOVI is administered to a patient, the name and 
batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch 
of the medicinal product. 
Paediatric population  
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation 
only if clearly indicated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
injection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADYNOVI. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted (see section 5.1). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The safety of ADYNOVI was evaluated in 365 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A 
(factor VIII less than 1% of normal), who received at least one dose of ADYNOVI in 6 completed 
multi-centre, prospective, open label clinical trials and 1 ongoing clinical trial.  
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (System Organ 
Class and Preferred Term Level).  
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and 
von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophilic 
patient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII 
acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. 
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the 
plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Rurioctocog alfa pegol, is a pegylated recombinant human factor VIII with an extended half-life. 
Rurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of octocog alfa consisting of 2 332 amino acids with 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent (MW 20 kDa). The therapeutic activity of rurioctocog alfa pegol is 
derived from octocog alfa, which is produced by recombinant DNA technology from a Chinese 
hamster ovary cell line. Octocog alfa is then covalently conjugated with the PEG reagent. The PEG 
moiety is conjugated to octocog alfa to increase the plasma half-life.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a pivotal multi-centre, 
open-label, prospective clinical trial that compared the efficacy of a twice weekly prophylactic 
treatment regimen to on-demand treatment and determined haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of 
bleeding episodes. A total of 137 male PTPs (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A 
received at least one infusion with ADYNOVI. Twenty-five of the 137 subjects were adolescents 
(12 to less than 18 years of age). 
Immunogenicity 
None of the subjects who participated in one or more of 6 completed clinical trials in previously 
treated patients (PTPs) developed persistent neutralizing (inhibitory) antibodies against FVIII of ≥ 0.6 
BU/mL (based on the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay). One patient developed a 
transient FVIII inhibitor at the lowest limit of positivity (0.6 BU) during personalized prophylaxis 
targeting a FVIII level of 8-12%. 
From an ongoing study in previously untreated patients < 6 years with severe hemophilia A, 
preliminary reports on 9 cases of FVIII inhibitor development associated with treatment with 
ADYNOVI were received.  
Prophylactic treatment 
Subjects received either prophylactic treatment (n = 120) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 40-50 IU 
per kg twice weekly or on-demand treatment (n = 17) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 10-60 IU per kg 
for a 6-month period. The median dosing interval was 3.6 days and the mean dose (SD) 
was 48.7 (4.4) IU/kg. One hundred eighteen of 120 (98%) prophylaxis subjects remained on the 
starting recommended regimen without dose adjustment, and 2 subjects increased their dose 
to 60 IU/kg during prophylaxis due to bleeding in target joints.  
In the per-protocol population, i.e. dosed according to the protocol specific dosing requirements, a 
total of 101 subjects received a twice a week regimen in the prophylaxis arm, and 17 subjects were 
treated episodically in the on-demand arm. The median annualised bleed rate (ABR) in the on-demand 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment arm was 41.5 compared to 1.9 while on a twice a week prophylaxis regimen. The median 
joint ABR (Q1 ; Q3) in the on-demand arm was 38.1 (24.5 ; 44.6) compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.0) while on 
prophylaxis, and the median spontaneous ABR was 21.6 (11.2 ; 33.2) on the on-demand arm 
compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.2) while on prophylaxis. Results for the full-analysis population were similar 
to those for the per-protocol population. Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor 
concentrates and between different clinical trials. 
Forty out of 101 subjects (40%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) 
experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced no spontaneous 
bleeding episodes in the prophylaxis arm. All subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a bleeding 
episode, including a joint or spontaneous bleeding episode. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
A total of 518 bleeding episodes were treated with ADYNOVI in the per-protocol population. Of 
these, 361 bleeding episodes (n=17 subjects) occurred in the on-demand arm and 157 (n=61 subjects) 
occurred in the prophylaxis arm. The median dose per infusion to treat all bleeding episodes in the 
per-protocol population was 32.0 (Interquartile Range (IQR): 21.5) IU per kg. Overall, 95.9% of 
bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 to 2 infusions and 85.5% were controlled with 
only 1 infusion. Of the 518 bleeding episodes, 96.1% were rated excellent (full relief of pain and 
cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or good (definite pain relief and/or 
improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in their response to treatment with 
ADYNOVI. 
Paediatric population < 12 years of age 
A total of 66 PTPs with severe haemophilia A were dosed (32 subjects aged < 6 years and 34 subjects 
aged 6 to < 12 years) in the paediatric study. The prophylactic regimen was 40 to 60 IU/kg of 
ADYNOVI twice a week. The mean dose (SD) was 54.3 (6.3) IU/kg and the median frequency of 
infusions per week was 1.87. The median overall ABR was 2.0 (IQR: 3.9) for the 65 subjects in the 
per-protocol population and the median ABRs for spontaneous and joint bleeding episodes were 
both 0 (IQR: 1.9). Twenty four out of 65 subjects (37%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 47 out 
of 65 subjects (72%) experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 43 out of 65 subjects (66%) 
experienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes on prophylaxis. 
Of the 70 bleeding episodes observed during the paediatric study, 82.9% were controlled 
with 1 infusion and 91.4% were controlled with 1 or 2 infusions. Control of bleeding was rated 
excellent (full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or 
good (definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in 63 out 
of 70 (90.0%) bleeding episodes.  
Perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) 
A total of 21 major surgical procedures and 5 additional minor surgeries were performed and assessed 
in 21 unique subjects in the surgery study. For major surgeries, the preoperative loading dose ranged 
from 36 IU/kg to 109 IU/kg (median: 63 IU/kg); and postoperative total dose ranged from 186 IU/kg 
to 1 320 IU/kg (median: 490 IU/kg). The median total dose for major surgeries was 553 IU/kg 
(range: 248-1 394 IU/kg) and the median total dose of minor surgeries was 106 IU/kg (range: 76-
132 IU/kg). 
Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent (blood loss less than or equal to that 
expected for the same type of procedure performed in a non-haemophilic patient, and required blood 
components for transfusions less than or similar to that expected in non-haemophilic population) for 
all 26 (21 major, 5 minor) procedures. The median (IQR) observed intraoperative blood loss (n = 14) 
was 10.0 (20.0) ml compared to the predicted average blood loss (n = 14) of 150.0 (140.0) ml for 
major orthopaedic surgeries.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with 
ADYNOVI in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of congenital 
factor VIII deficiency. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Long-term prophylaxis treatment in paediatric and adult subjects 
The long-term safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes 
was evaluated in 216 paediatric and adult PTPs with severe haemophilia A who had either previously 
participated in other ADYNOVI studies or were naïve to ADYNOVI. In the treated population, 
subjects received a fixed-dose twice-weekly regimen of 40 to 50 IU/kg if aged ≥ 12 years or of 40 to 
60 IU/kg if aged < 12 years. The dose was adjusted up to 80 IU/kg twice weekly if required to 
maintain FVIII trough levels of > 1%. Subjects that opted for a personalized (pharmacokinetically-
tailored) prophylactic regimen received doses up to 80 IU/kg per infusion that targeted FVIII trough 
levels of ≥ 3% at least twice weekly. ABR per prophylactic regimen, bleeding site and etiology are 
presented in Table 3.

Long-term haemostatic efficacy was evaluated in 910 bleeding episodes treated with ADYNOVI and 
was rated excellent or good in 88.5% of bleeding episodes. Across age categories and for both the 
fixed-dose and the PK-tailored dose regimen, >85% of bleed treatments were rated excellent or good. 
The majority of bleeding episodes were treated with one (74.0%) or two (15.4%) infusions. 
Personalized prophylaxis PROPEL clinical trial in adolescents and adult subjects 
The safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, open-label 
multi-centre study in 121 (115 randomized) adolescents (12-18 years old) and adult PTPs with severe 
haemophilia A for a 12-month treatment period. The study compared 2 PK-guided prophylactic dosing 
regimens of ADYNOVI that targeted Factor VIII trough levels of 1-3% dosed twice weekly (N=57) or 
8-12% dosed every other day (N=58), by assessing the proportions of subjects achieving a total ABR 
of 0 in the second 6-month study period. 
The average prophylactic doses administered in the 1-3% and 8-12 % trough arms were 3 866.1 IU/kg 
per year [mean (SD) infusions/week = 2.3 (0.58)] and 7 532.8 IU/kg per year [(mean (SD) 
infusions/week = 3.6 (1.18)], respectively. After dose adjustment during the first 6-month period of 
prophylaxis, median trough levels in the second 6-month period (based on the one-stage clotting assay 
and calculated to the end of the planned infusion interval) ranged from 2.10 IU/dL to 3.00 IU/dL in the 
1-3% trough level arm and from 10.70 IU/dL to 11.70 IU/dL in the 8-12 % trough level arm, 
demonstrating that dosing in the 2 prophylaxis regimens was generally adequate to achieve and 
maintain the desired FVIII trough levels.

The primary endpoint of the study, proportion of subjects who had a total ABR of 0 during the second 
6-month period, was not reached in the ITT patient population (p= 0.0545) but was reached in the per-
protocol population (p = 0.0154). The proportions of randomized subjects with total ABRs, 
spontaneous ABRs and spontaneous annualized joint bleeding rates (AJBRs) of 0 during the second 6-
month study period are presented in Table 4.

The majority of bleeds (86.0%, 208/242) were treated with 1 or 2 infusions; and bleed treatment at 
resolution of the bleeding episode was rated excellent or good in 84.7% (205/242) of bleeds. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a crossover study with octocog alfa 
in 26 subjects (18 adults and 8 adolescents) and in 22 subjects (16 adults and 6 adolescents) 
after 6 months of treatment with ADYNOVI. Plasma factor VIII activity was measured by the 
one stage clotting assay and chromogenic assay. 
ADYNOVI has an extended half-life of 1.4 to 1.5-fold compared to recombinant human coagulation 
factor VIII (octocog alfa) in the adolescent and adult population, as determined based on one stage 
clotting and chromogenic assays, respectively. An increase in AUC and a decrease in clearance as 
compared to the parent molecule, octocog alfa, were also observed. Incremental recovery was 
comparable with both products. The change in PK parameters was similar in both the adult and 
adolescent populations and between one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays. 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from 39 subjects less than 18 years of age (intent-to-treat 
analysis) are available for 14 children (2 to less than 6 years), 17 older children (6 to less 
than 12 years) and 8 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age). The half-life extension in the 
paediatric population was 1.3 to 1.5 fold using both the one stage clotting and chromogenic assays. 
The mean clearance (based on body weight) of ADYNOVI was higher and the mean half-life was 
lower in children less than 12 years of age than adults.  
A higher dose may be required in children less than 12 years of age, see section 4.2.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey, two animals showed vacuolation in the 
kidney in the mid dose group (350 IU/kg). The vacuolations did not recover after 2 weeks. The human 
relevance of kidney vacuolation observed in the preclinical study is unknown. 
Nonclinical data are limited to 1 month exposure and no studies in juvenile animals were conducted 
with ADYNOVI. Thus, it was not possible to conclude on the potential risks of PEG accumulation in 
various tissues/organs relevant for chronic use of ADYNOVI in the paediatric population No studies 
on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity have been performed with ADYNOVI.

- 
- 
ADYNOVI with BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device: Each pack contains a powder vial, a solvent vial 
and a device for reconstitution (BAXJECT II Hi-Flow). 
ADYNOVI in BAXJECT III system: Each pack contains a ready to use BAXJECT III system in 
a sealed blister, with the powder vial and the solvent vial preassembled for reconstitution. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use 
solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.  
After reconstitution, the solution has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3. The osmolality is ≥ 380 mOsmol/kg. 
Preparation and reconstitution using the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device 
For reconstitution use only the solvent vial and the reconstitution device provided in the pack. 
1. 
Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the 
reconstitution procedure. 
Allow the vials of powder and solvent to reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C) 
before use. 
Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. 
Clean rubber stoppers with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry prior to use. 
Open the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device package by peeling away the lid, without touching the 
inside (Figure A). Do not remove the device from the package. 
Turn the package over. Press straight down to fully insert the clear plastic spike through the 
solvent vial stopper (Figure B).  
Grip the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow package at its edge and pull the package off the device 
(Figure C). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device. Do not touch 
the exposed purple plastic spike. 
Turn the system over so that the solvent vial is on top. Quickly insert the purple plastic spike 
fully into the powder vial stopper by pushing straight down (Figure D). The vacuum will draw 
the solvent into the powder vial. 
Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution.

Do not use if particulate matter or discolouration is observed. 
Administration steps 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device (Figure E). Do not draw air into 
the syringe. Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is 
recommended.  
Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the 
syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Figure F).  
Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously. If a patient is to 
receive more than one vial of ADYNOVI, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the 
same syringe.  
A separate BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device is required to reconstitute each vial of ADYNOVI with 
the solvent. 
Administer over a period of up to 5 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 ml per min).  
It is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the powder vial. 
Reconstitution with the BAXJECT III system 
Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister 
1. 
If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent 
vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room 
temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). 
2.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
4. 
Open the ADYNOVI blister by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from 
the blister. 
Place the powder vial on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Figure 1). The solvent vial 
has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. 
6. 
5.  With one hand holding the powder vial in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the 
solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down 
into the powder vial (Figure 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. 
Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved 
(Figure 3). Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted 
solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less 
than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from 
particles.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for 
ADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation 
factor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. 
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A 
(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. 
ADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). 
2.  What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI  
Do not use ADYNOVI 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.

Warnings and precautions  
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your ADYNOVI. So, every time you get a 
new package of ADYNOVI, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after {abbreviation used for batch number}) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Talk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI. 
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, 
hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, 
tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms 
of anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and 
extreme difficulty in breathing. 
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. 
If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood 
clotting (coagulation) complications. 
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. 
Catheter-related complications  
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and 
precautions also apply to adolescents. 
Other medicines and ADYNOVI 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. 
Therefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during pregnancy and breast-feeding is 
available. 
Driving and using machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
ADYNOVI contains sodium 
ADYNOVI contains up to 12.42 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.62% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Depending on your body weight and your dose of ADYNOVI, you could receive multiple vials. This 
should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.

3. 
How to use ADYNOVI 
Treatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care 
of patients with haemophilia A. 
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, 
and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will 
depend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with 
ADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. 
Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
If you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. 
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
Use in children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents 
is also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. 
How ADYNOVI is given 
ADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone 
else might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. 
Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. 
If you use more ADYNOVI than you should 
Always use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use ADYNOVI 
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using ADYNOVI 
Do not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 day, 
until the bleeding episode, as 
indicated by pain, is resolved or 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The 
long-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments 
of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual 
bleeding tendency.

your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. 
Therefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during pregnancy and breast-feeding is 
available. 
Driving and using machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
ADYNOVI contains sodium 
ADYNOVI contains up to 12.42 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.62% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Depending on your body weight and your dose of ADYNOVI, you could receive multiple vials. This 
should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.

3. 
How to use ADYNOVI 
Treatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care 
of patients with haemophilia A. 
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, 
and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will 
depend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with 
ADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. 
Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
If you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. 
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
Use in children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents 
is also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. 
How ADYNOVI is given 
ADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone 
else might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. 
Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. 
If you use more ADYNOVI than you should 
Always use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use ADYNOVI 
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using ADYNOVI 
Do not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The 
long-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments 
of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual 
bleeding tendency.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for 
ADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation 
factor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. 
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A 
(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. 
ADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). 
2.  What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI 
Do not use ADYNOVI 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. 
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your ADYNOVI. So, every time you get a 
new package of ADYNOVI, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after {abbreviation used for batch number}) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Talk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI.  
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, 
hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, 
tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms 
of anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and 
extreme difficulty in breathing. 
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. 
If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood 
clotting (coagulation) complications. 
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. 
Catheter-related complications  
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and 
precautions also apply to adolescents. 
Other medicines and ADYNOVI 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. 
Therefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during pregnancy and breast-feeding is 
available. 
Driving and using machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
ADYNOVI contains sodium 
ADYNOVI contains up to 12.42 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.62% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Depending on your body weight and your dose of ADYNOVI, you could receive multiple vials. This 
should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.

until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The 
long-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments 
of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual 
bleeding tendency.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for 
ADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation 
factor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. 
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A 
(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. 
ADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). 
2.  What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI 
Do not use ADYNOVI 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. 
136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your ADYNOVI. So, every time you get a 
new package of ADYNOVI, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after {abbreviation used for batch number}) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Talk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI.  
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, 
hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, 
tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms 
of anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and 
extreme difficulty in breathing. 
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. 
If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood 
clotting (coagulation) complications. 
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. 
Catheter-related complications  
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and 
precautions also apply to adolescents. 
Other medicines and ADYNOVI 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. 
Therefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during pregnancy and breast-feeding is 
available. 
Driving and using machines 
ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
ADYNOVI contains sodium 
ADYNOVI contains up to 12.42 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.62% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Depending on your body weight and your dose of ADYNOVI, you could receive multiple vials. This 
should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet. 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use ADYNOVI 
Treatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care 
of patients with haemophilia A. 
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, 
and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will 
depend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with 
ADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. 
Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
If you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. 
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
Use in children and adolescents 
ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents 
is also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. 
How ADYNOVI is given 
ADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone 
else might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. 
Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. 
If you use more ADYNOVI than you should 
Always use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use ADYNOVI 
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using ADYNOVI 
Do not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Instructions for preparation and administration 
ADYNOVI must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents. 
It is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the blister. 
Instructions for reconstitution 
 
 
 
1. 
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton. 
Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister 
Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation. 
If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent 
vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room 
temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). 
2.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
3. 
Open the ADYNOVI blister by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from 
the blister. 
Place the powder vial on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Figure 1). The solvent vial 
has a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. 
4. 
6. 
5.  With one hand holding the powder vial in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the 
solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down 
into the powder vial (Figure 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. 
Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved 
(Figure 3). Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted 
solution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less 
than 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from 
foreign particles.

Instructions for injection 
Antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) is required during administration. 
Important note: 
 
Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration 
(the solution should be clear, colourless and free from particles). 
Do not use if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT III (Figure 4). Do not draw air into the syringe. 
Connect the syringe to BAXJECT III. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is recommended. 
Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the 
syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Figure 5). 
Disconnect the syringe; attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted 
solution into a vein. The solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the 
patient’s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
Discard any unused solution appropriately.

On demand treatment 
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table can be 
used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

Table 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery 
Degree of haemorrhage/type 
of surgical procedure 
Haemorrhage 
Early haemarthrosis, muscle 
bleeding or oral bleeding. 
20 – 40 
Factor VIII level 
required (% or IU/dl) 
Frequency of doses 
(hours)/duration of therapy (days) 
More extensive haemarthrosis, 
muscle bleeding or haematoma 
30 – 60 
Life threatening haemorrhages.  60 – 100 
Surgery 
Minor 
Including tooth extraction. 
Major 
30 – 60 
80 – 100 
(pre- and postoperative) 
Repeat injections 
every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 day, 
until the bleeding episode, as 
indicated by pain, is resolved or 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved. 
Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a 
factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% 
(IU/dl). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be 
considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Paediatric population  
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult 
patients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The 
long-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments 
of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual 
bleeding tendency.

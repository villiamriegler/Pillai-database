Introduction 
Xeloda (capecitabine), is a pro-drug of 5-FU and is indicated for:  
- 
- 
- 
the adjuvant treatment of patients following surgery for stage III (Dukes´stage C) colon cancer 
the first line monotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer 
in  combination  with  docetaxel  (Taxotere)  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy  should  have 
included an anthracycline.  
as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer 
after  failure  of  taxanes  and  an  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy  regimen  or  for  whom 
further anthracycline therapy is not indicated

This  application 
from  
to  support  an  enlargement  of 
“Xeloda  is  indicated  for  first  line  monotherapy  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (see  section  5.1)”  to 
Xeloda  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (see  section  5.1)  and  resulting 
changes  in  SPC  sections  4.2,  4.3,  4.4,  4.5,  4.8,  and  5.1.  In  effect,  it  is  claimed  that  Xeloda  is  also 
indicated in (any) combination at any line of treatment. 
the  mCRC 
indication 
The  backbone  of  treatment  for  colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  is  fluorouracil  which  is  thought  to  act 
primarily  by  inhibiting  thymidylate  synthase,  the  rate  limiting  enzyme  in  pyrimidine  nucleotide 
synthesis.  Prospective  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  use  of  chemotherapy  in  patients  with 
metastatic disease (mCRC) prolongs survival and enhances quality of life in comparison to palliative 
care alone1. An estimate for the clinical benefit derives from a meta-analysis of 13 such trials revealing 
that systemic chemotherapy leads to an improvement in 1-year survival from 34 percent to 50 percent 
and an improvement in median survival by 3.7 months2.  
For the past 40 years, 5-FU used alone, or more recently in combination with leucovorin (LV), was the 
only established chemotherapy for mCRC. In the past 8 years, 5 new substances, 3 with a cytotoxic 
mechanism  of  action  (irinotecan,  oxaliplatin,  capecitabine),  and  2  targeted  monoclonal  antibodies 
(bevacizumab and cetuximab) have been introduced into clinical practice. 
The current ESMO (European Society of Medical Oncology) Minimum Clinical Recommendations 
for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of advanced colorectal cancer3 reads as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Surgery should be considered for solitary or confined liver or pulmonary metastases. 
First line palliative chemotherapy should be considered early and consists of 5-fluorouracil (5-
FU) in various combinations and schedules. Infused regimens of 5-FU/leucovorin (LV) are 
generally less toxic than bolus regimens. The oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine is an 
alternative to infusional 5-FU/LV [I, B]. 
Combination chemotherapy with 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin or 5-FU/LV/irinotecan provides better 
survival than 5-FU/LV. [II, A]. 
 Novel targeted agents, i.e. monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in combination with chemotherapy 
may be considered in carefully selected patients. 
Second line chemotherapy should be considered for selected patients with maintained good 
performance status [I, A]. 
Concerning combination therapy with BV, the MAH consider that it is recommended, but comparative 
phase II and III data were only available for the combinations of IFL and BV, FOLFOX, and FOLFIRI 
(5-FU/LV, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan) as first-line therapy and FOLFOX and BV as second-line 
therapy. Therefore, combination therapy of capecitabine with oxaliplatin and BV needed to be 
investigated. An extension of the current indication for capecitabine would allow the benefits of 
capecitabine combination therapy to be made available to patients across all current standard treatment

regimens and increase the ability of oncologists to choose the most appropriate therapy for their 
patients. 
The  MAH  states  that  clinical  data  generated  to  date  consistently  suggest  that  capecitabine  has 
equivalent efficacy to 5-FU/LV in mCRC. This statement is underlined with reference to the results of 
three  large  phase  III  studies  in  colorectal  cancer  (M66001  [=X-ACT  trial  in  the  adjuvant  setting  of 
colon cancer], SO14796, and SO14695 [both the pivotal trials for the first MAA granted to Xeloda as 
monotherapy  in  mCRC];  which  have  demonstrated  that  capecitabine  is  at  least  as  effective  with 
respect  to  PFS  and  overall  survival  (OS)  when  administered  as  intravenous  bolus  5-FU/LV  (Mayo 
regimen), with a comparable safety profile. 
Currently,  FOLFOX-4  has  become  a  standard  treatment  for  mCRC.  Since  capecitabine  provides  an 
effective,  convenient  and  generally  tolerable  safety  profile  compared  to  5-FU/LV,  and  since 
capecitabine  and  oxaliplatin  show  no  overlap  of  key  toxicities,  studies  combining  capecitabine  with 
oxaliplatin  were  needed  to  evaluate  whether  capecitabine  can  provide  benefit  in  this  combination  in 
the setting of mCRC. 
1.2 Clinical aspects 
The clinical program is mainly based on 2 pivotal Phase III non-inferiority trials: NO16966 and 
NO16967 
Supplemental data supporting the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of the XELOX and 
XELOX+BV dosing regimens are provided from the following studies: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Trial NP18587 (PK1), an open label multi-centre trial to assess the PK interaction between 
capecitabine and oxaliplatin in the absence or presence of BV in patients with mCRC. 
NP18587 (PK1) is a PK sub-study of trial NO16966 in Canadian centres. 
A published4 phase I trial to determine the optimal dosing regimen for XELOX. 
Trial M66016  an open-label, multicenter, multi-national, single-arm, Phase II study 
evaluating the overall response rateto XELOX combination therapy in patients with advanced 
and/or mCRC. 
Trial NO16968, an ongoing study in the adjuvant setting, for which available safety data are 
included exclusively in the Summary of Clinical Safety (CSS) 
Two smaller clinical trials (M66009, Phase I, and M66016, Phase II) have investigated the 
combination of capecitabine with oxaliplatin and revealed significant activity with a tolerable safety 
profile. Based on these two studies, 2 non-inferiority Phase III studies comparing XELOX with 
FOLFOX-4 in the first- (NO16966) and second-line (NO16967) settings were started in 2002. In 2003, 
two randomized, controlled clinical trials of BV in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based 
chemotherapy (AVF0780g, Phase II and AVF2107g, Phase III) were reported. The AVF2107g trial 
showed that BV in combination with IFL as first-line chemotherapy in patients with mCRC was 
superior in terms of disease free survival and OS compared to chemotherapy (IFL) alone. As a 
consequence, the first-line trial NO16966 was amended to assess the potential improvement when BV 
is added to XELOX or FOLFOX-4. 
1. 2. 1.  Clinical Phrmacology 
PK interactions between capecitabine and oxaliplatin (+/-bevacizumab) in patients with mCRC 
Trial NP18587 (PK1) was conducted (as a sub-study of trial NO16966) in three centres in Canada 
between August 8, 2005 and September 21, 2006. The objectives of this PK study were to determine 
whether oxaliplatin influences the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and vice versa, as well as any 
combination of the two with bevacizumab. 
It was an open label, multi-centre trial with a primary treatment phase of 16 cycles of treatment or 
until progressive disease or withdrawal. Samples for PK analysis were collected during the first 3

cycles of treatment. Treatment in cycle 4 to 16 consisted in the triple combination (capecitabine, 
oxaliplatin, bevacizumab) administered at cycle 3 as long as no dose modification /interruption/ 
stopping of a single combination partner was required. The schedule investigated for capecitabine and 
oxaliplatin in trial NP18587 (PK1) reflects the recommended dose deriving from the published phase I 
trial where diarrhoea was the DLT.  
The primary parameter for Capecitabine was AUC0-∞ of 5’-DFUR. 
Secondary parameters were AUC0-∞, AUC0-last, Cmax, and t½β of capecitabine and its metabolites (5’-
DFCR, 5-FU, and FBAL); AUC0-last, Cmax, and t½β  of 5’-DFUR.  
The primary parameter for Oxaliplatin was AUC0-∞ of free platinum. 
Secondary parameters were AUC0-∞, Cmax, AUC0-last, t½, VSS and CL of total platinum; Cmax, AUC0-last, 
t½, VSS and CL of free platinum. The PK results are best summarised as in Table 1:

Treatment with the capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in combination was generally well 
tolerated with no new or unexpected safety signals. The most common types of adverse events 
reported were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea) and nervous system 
disorders (peripheral sensory neuropathy and neuropathy peripheral), both of which are common 
toxicities of capecitabine and oxaliplatin. As of September 21, 2006 there were no deaths reported in 
this study.

MTD/DLT of Capecitabine in Combination with Oxaliplatin (XELOX) 
A  phase  I  dose  escalation  trial  (M66009)  conducted  to  investigate  the  safety  of  the  combination  of 
oxaliplatin and oral capecitabine has been submitted as a publication5 only. Twenty-three patients with 
advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumours  received  a  3-weekly  intermittent  regimen  of  oral  capecitabine 
(500, 825, 1000 or 1250 mg/m2, x 14 days, 7days rest) in subsequent cohorts of 3 patients (provided 
that no dose limiting toxicities [DLT] occurred) each in combination with a fixed dose (130 mg/m2, 2 
hr  IV  infusion,  4-6  hours  after  the  first  morning  dose  of  capecitabine)  of  oxaliplatin.  Dose-limiting 
toxicities were such which occurred during the first treatment cycle, did not resolve within 2 days of 
symptomatic treatment, and fulfilled one of the following criteria: grade 3/4 diarrhoea, any other grade 
3/4 gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3 hand-foot-syndrome, grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy, any 
other  clinically  relevant  grade  3/4  toxicity,  prolonged  (grade  4  >  5  days)  granulocytopenia  with 
complications (such as neutropenic fever, mucositis, or diarrhoea) 
In  the  cohorts  treated  with  500  to  825  mg/m2  bid  capecitabine  no  DLT  occurred.  Dose  limiting 
diarrhoea was observed in 1 of 9 patients treated at the dose level 1000 mg/m2 bid capecitabine. Two 
of 6 patients treated at the dose level 1250 mg/m2 bid capecitabine experienced dose limiting diarrhoea 
which was accompanied either by grade 3 thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia  
Based on the study results the recommended dosing schedule for capecitabine was 1000 mg/m2 twice 
daily  (x  14  days)  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  130  mg/m2  (day  1)  in  an  every  3  week  treatment 
cycle.

5, Protocol Version E as of 02 December 2005 
Trial NO16966 consists in two parts: The trial was started under protocol version A approved on 31 
January 2003. According to this version, patients were randomized to one of two different treatment 
groups (XELOX or FOLFOX-4). In May of 2003, the results of a large phase III trial showed that 
bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan plus bolus 5-FU/LV (IFL) as first line therapy for 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, was significantly superior in terms of OS, progression free 
survival and rate of best response compared to IFL chemotherapy alone (see also MA status of 
Avastin). Consequently, on 04 August 2003 the protocol was amended to version B. In this 
amendment, bevacizumab or placebo was added to the chemotherapeutic regimens being studied. This 
changed the design to a four-arm, partially blinded study which included an additional comparison 
between bevacizumab and placebo. During this subsequent 2x2 factorial part additional patients were 
randomized into one of the four treatment groups XELOX+P (XELOX + placebo),  FOLFOX-4+P 
(FOLFOX-4 + placebo), XELOX+BV (XELOX + bevacizumab), or FOLFOX-4+BV (FOLFOX-
4+bevacizumab). Overall, trial NO16966 is a partially blinded (as regards to BV/placebo treatment 
and IRC assessment [see below], open as regards to the chemotherapy treatments), randomised, large,

international6, multi-centre7 phase III trial investigating overall 6 treatments, 4 of them in terms of a 
2x2 factorial design, in two subsequent parts. 
Starting with protocol version B, the co-primary objectives of trial NO16966 were: 
• 
• 
To demonstrate that the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) with or 
without bevacizumab (BV) is at least equivalent to the combination of fluorouracil and folinic 
acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) with or without BV in terms of time to tumour progression 
or death due to any cause. 
To demonstrate that BV in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX+BV/FOLFOX-4+BV) 
is superior to chemotherapy alone (XELOX+P/FOLFOX-4+P) in terms of time to tumour 
progression or death due to any cause. 
Secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate and compare the efficacy (OS, overall response rate according to the RECIST 
criteria, time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment failure) of XELOX with 
or without BV to the combination of FOLFOX-4 with or without BV. 
To evaluate and compare the efficacy (OS, overall response rate according to the RECIST 
criteria, time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment failure) of BV plus 
chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone (XELOX+BV, FOLFOX-4+BV) to (XELOX+P, 
FOLFOX-4+P). 
To evaluate and compare the safety profiles of the four treatment groups using the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
To evaluate and compare perceived treatment convenience and satisfaction with treatment for 
patients who received XELOX with or without BV to patients who received FOLFOX-4 with 
or without BV. 
To evaluate and compare medical care utilization in the four treatment groups. 
To collect pathological specimens of the patients’ tumours in a prospective fashion for studies 
of diagnostic biomarkers that may be relevant to fluoropyrimidine metabolism [ie, thymidine 
phosphorylase (TP), thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)] 
and oxaliplatin (chemopredictive project). 
At selected centres, to enroll patients participating in NO16966 into a stand-alone study 
NP18587 (PK-1; see above). 
At selected centres, to enroll patients participating in this study into sub-study NO16966 PK-
2. The sub-study was designed to compare the exposure of two different dosing regimens of 
bevacizumab, 7.5 mg/kg every 3rd week and 5 mg/kg every 2nd week, at steady state. Due to 
low recruitment, this sub-study was transferred to stand-alone study NP18587. 
To offer patients participating in the study the possibility to also participate in the independent 
sub-study NO16966RG. This sub-study was designed to derive pharmacogenetic information 
to facilitate research regarding prediction of response to specific drug therapy, susceptibility to 
develop adverse effects, progression to more severe disease or identifying genetic risk factors 
for disease. 
The rationale for the XELOX (+/- Placebo; +/- BV) schedule investigated (1000 mg/m2 capecitabine 
twice daily for 14 days if combined with 130 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin on day 1 in an every 3 week treatment 
cycle) is directly based on the results of phase I and II trials M66009 and M66016. The rationale for 
the FOLFOX (+/- Placebo; +/- BV) schedule investigated is the MA status of Eloxatin (oxaliplatin), or 
better, the schedule investigated with trial EFC 29628 (i.e. 85 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin 2-hr IV Day 1 every 2

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  typical  for  a  trial  selecting  for  an  adult,  non  pregnant  first  line 
population of patients with histologically confirmed metastatic adeno-carcinoma of colon or rectum at 
otherwise good health. It may be mentioned that the switch from protocol version A to B introduced 
additional exclusion criteria taking into account contraindications and warnings for Avastin (such as 
e.g. wound healing complications or haemorrhage). 
After screening, patients were randomized in the first part to Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin (XELOX, arm 
A’), 5-FU/ Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, arm B’), and in the second part in a 2x2 factorial manner to overall 
4 arms (XELOX+P, arm  A; FOLFOX+P, arm  B;  XELOX+BV, arm C;  and FOLFOX+BV, arm  D). 
The process was adaptive randomization, with stratification. This process of randomization (including 
stratification) was employed to ensure that the two treatment arms were balanced with regard to the 
following  prognostic  factors:  overall  study,  ECOG  Performance  Status  (0  versus  1),  number  of 
metastatic  sites  (organs)  at  baseline  (1  versus  >1),  alkaline  phosphatase  level  at  baseline  (within 
normal range versus above normal range), liver as a site of metastasis (yes versus no), and geographic 
region. 
The trial (in both parts) comprised three phases: 
Patients were to receive up to 16 cycles (arms A’, A and C) or 24 cycles (arms B’, B and D) of 
treatment during the Primary Study Treatment Phase (each 48 weeks). Actual duration of treatment 
depended on individual response and tolerance. If one of the treatment combination components was 
discontinued due to toxicity or patient refusal, treatment could be continued with the remaining 
treatment(s). 
Patients who completed the 48-week primary study treatment phase without progressive disease (ie, 
who had a CR, PR, or SD) were eligible to enter the Post-Study Treatment Phase at the discretion of 
the investigator and the sponsor. Patients who entered this phase were to continue treatment on the 
same regimen to which they were initially randomized (including any dose modifications implemented 
during the primary study treatment phase) until either progression of disease was documented, 
unacceptable toxicity occurred, or patient withdrew consent to continue in the study. 
Patients who terminated study treatment during the primary or post-study treatment phase were 
followed until disease progression or death (Follow-up Phase). 
An overview of the different schedules in the overall 6 different treatment arms is provided with some 
more details in Figure 1 and Figure 2 whereas the rational for dose selection was already presented.

10 Please note that the de Gramont Schedule is administered every 2 weeks. The recommended dose for Oxaliplatin is 130 
mg/m2 every 3 weeks. For administering Oxaliplatin in addition to the de Gramont schedule, single Oxaliplatin was 
already reduced for the means of trial EFC 2962 from 130 mg/m2 every 3 weeks to 85 mg/m2 in order to achieve a 
comparable cumulative dose/exposure.

The primary efficacy parameter was PFS based on investigators' tumour assessments. PFS was 
defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first day of documented disease progression 
or death due to any cause.

The independent response review was based on the RECIST criteria for response and was undertaken 
by an independent response review committee (IRC). Patients were reviewed in a blinded fashion. The 
independent response review was strictly a radiological review, based solely on the scans. 
Non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4 
All analyses of non-inferiority were based on the EPP11. Key analyses were repeated for the ITT12 and 
PPP13.  At least equivalence of XELOX with/without bevacizumab to FOLFOX-4 with/without 
bevacizumab was tested via the following hypotheses: H0: HRA’AC/B’BD ≥ 1.23 versus H1: 
HRA’AC/B’BD < 1.23. 
Where, HRA’AC/B’BD denoted the HR of XELOX with/without bevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 
with/without bevacizumab. At least equivalence was concluded if the upper limit of the two sided 
97.5% confidence interval for the HR did not exceed 1.23. 
The analysis was stratified using the following three strata: 
Stratum 1: 
Stratum 2: 
Patients randomized during the initial 2-arm part of the study (arms A’ and B’); 
Patients randomized during the 2x2 factorial part of the study to arms A or B (arms 
with placebo treatment); 
11 Eligible Patient Population: excluded patients from the ITT who had violated major protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria 
12 Intent-to-treat Population: all randomized patients (=ALL) who provided written informed consent. 
13 Per-Protocol Population: Subgroup of the EPP mainly excluding from the EPP those patients who did not start a pre-
specified number (3 of 4 dependent on the arm) of treatment cycles.

Stratum 3: 
Patients randomized during the 2x2 factorial part of the study to arms C or D (arms 
with bevacizumab treatment). 
In addition, Kaplan-Meier estimates, median times to tumour progression as well as progression-free 
rates at 6, 12, and 18 months with 95% confidence intervals are reported separately for the pool of all 
patients treated with XELOX and all patients treated with FOLFOX-4. The interpretation of this 
analysis (one combined median time for two different treatments), however, might be difficult and 
therefore these results were also reported separately for the four treatment groups A/A’, B/B’, C, and 
D. 
For the assessment of non-inferiority in the different treatment subgroups, two separate analyses were 
performed: 
• 
• 
Based on all patients who were randomized to the initial 2-arm part of the study or to the 
placebo containing treatment arms of the 2x2 factorial part of the study (arms A’, A, B’ and 
B) 
Based on all patients who were randomized to the bevacizumab-containing treatment arms of 
the 2x2 factorial part of the study (arms C and D) 
Results 
A total of 2035 patients from 32 countries were randomized to any one of the treatment groups in 
study NO16966 (634 patients in the initial 2-arm part and 1401 in the 2x2 factorial part of the study). 
In the initial 2-arm part of the study, the first patient was randomized on July 15, 2003 and the last 
patient was randomized on May 7, 2004. In the 2x2 factorial part of the study, the first patient was 
randomized on February 4, 2004 and the last patient was randomized on February 10, 2005. As switch 
from protocol version A to B was performed centre by centre, last and first randomisation dates are 
overlapping. 
Thirty-seven randomised patients received no study medication. One patient was randomised twice 
into the study at a different study centre each time.

Demographic data were well balanced. There are small differences concerning demographic 
differences between the initial 2-arm and the 2x2 factorial part of the study as follows: 
•  The proportion of Caucasian patients that enrolled in the 2x2 factorial part was higher 
compared to the initial 2-arm part because centres in China did not participate in the 2x2 
factorial part of the study. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  An increase of approximately 10% was observed in the percentages of patients with an ECOG 
PS of 0 in the 2x2 factorial compared with patients in the initial 2-arm part of the study. 
Concerning stratification factors and as adaptive randomisation with stratification was performed) 
distribution of patients in the different levels of each stratum was well balanced across the treatment 
groups.  
A similar percentage of XELOX and FOLFOX-4- treated patients (ITT) from the initial 2-arm part 
were withdrawn prematurely from treatment (93% and 95%, respectively) and withdrawn prematurely 
from treatment for safety related reasons (36% and 32% respectively). The percentage of patients 
withdrawn for non-safety reasons was 64% in the FOLFOX-4 and 57% in the XELOX arm. The major 
reason for premature withdrawal was insufficient therapeutic response (i.e., disease progression 
documented during the treatment phase of the study); the percentage of patients was similar in the 
XELOX treatment arm 131/317 (41%) and the FOLFOX-4 treatment arm 127/317 (40%). 
Adding the2x2 factorial part, the majority of patients overall withdrew from study treatment (all 
treatment components) due to non-safety reasons (1222/2034 patients, 60%), mostly for insufficient 
therapeutic response. The proportion of patients who withdrew due to disease progression was lower 
for patients who had bevacizumab in their treatment regimen (203/699, 29%) compared with those 
who did not (587/1335, 44%). Safety reasons were the cause of withdrawal from all treatment 
components in the primary study treatment phase for a total of 589/2034 (29%) patients. In the initial 
2-arm part, approximately 30% of the patients experienced an AE leading to withdrawal. In the 2x2 
factorial part, 20% of patients in the control arm and approximately 30% in the BV containing arms 
reported AE as a reason for withdrawal. 
Results: Primary Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint (PFS): non-inferiority Results 
The first co-primary objective (non-inferiority in PFS in the EPP, investigators’ assessment) was met 
(see Table 3). 
Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the 
overall comparison was demonstrated. The upper limit of the 97.5% CI was below the pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin of 1.23. Kaplan-Meier curves are virtually super-imposable (see Figure 3).

Comparison-XELOX/XELOX+P/XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-
4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV 
Any statistically significant or clinically relevant interaction between BV and the chemotherapy 
backbone was ruled out justifying, according to the applicant, the pooling of the treatment subgroups 
in the primary analysis. 
Results were similar in the ITT population and in the PPP. 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the treatment subgroup comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P 
versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P. The same applies on the exploratory subgroup comparison of 
XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV. Non-inferiority was further supported by the results of the 
exploratory subgroup comparison of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 from the initial 2-arm part of the 
protocol.

However, results for PFS according to IRC assessment were not supportive for the non-inferiority 
analysis (table 4) In the overall comparison, the HR was 1.22 (97.5% CI = [1.05; 1.42]). 
Subgroup analyses reveal similar results: In the treatment subgroup comparison of XELOX / XELOX 
+ P versus FOLFOX-4 / FOLFOX-4 + P, HR was 1.25 (97.5% CI = [1.04; 1.50]). In the exploratory 
subgroup comparison of XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV, HR was 1.17 (97.5% CI= [0.90; 
1.53]).  
Results of the analysis for non-inferiority (EPP) for PFS using the on-treatment approach were not 
supportive for the non-inferiority analysis. In the overall comparison, the HR was 1.24 (97.5% CI = 
[1.07; 1.44]). Similar results were seen in the treatment subgroup comparison for XELOX/XELOX+P 
versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P (HR=1.22, 97.5% CI = [1.03; 1.45]) and in treatment subgroup 
comparison XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV (HR=1.29. 97.5% CI = [0.97; 1.71]). 
Results were similar in the ITT population and in the PPP.

Table 4 
NO169662: PFS (IRC): Main Efficacy Results for Non-inferiority of XELOX 
versus FOLFOX-4 
Results: Secondary Endpoints 
PFS for superiority of XELOX over FOLFOX-4 (not significant), PFS for tumour assessments by the 
IRC, PFS (on treatment approach) and PFS for Curative Surgery not censored were pre-specified 
secondary efficacy endpoints of trial NO169662. As these endpoints have already been discussed in 
context and in relation to the primary endpoints (in the sense of sensitivity analysis of the primary), 
they are not displayed here again. 
Overall Survival OS: Non-Inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 
Trial NO16966 was not powered for testing non-inferiority of XELOX vs. FOLFOX-4 with respect to 
overall survival. The same margins used for the PFS analysis were therefore applied to OS as well. 
The analysis of non-inferiority in the EPP in terms of OS was supportive of the results obtained in the 
primary analysis of non-inferiority for PFS. For the overall comparison, HR was 0.97 (97.5% CI = 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[0.84; 1.14]; see also Table 3). The result was rather robust in subgroup analysis. The MAH did also 
demonstrate that the results are relatively mature. It should be noted that by trend OS for XELOX is 
slightly longer than for FOLFOX once median (of about 18 months) is reached (see also Figure 4). 
Figure 4 
NO169662: Overall Survival: KM Curves for Non-inferiority (EPP) XELOX / 
XELOX+P/XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV 
OS: Superiority of Chemotherapy plus BV over Chemotherapy Alone 
The MAH considers the result concerning the second, blinded part of the trial as still to immature to 
draw any reliable conclusion. Therefore, he presented the data without any further comment. The most 
relevant result at time point of cut-off may be briefly presented here: 
In the ITT population the number of events in the FOLFOX-4+P/XELOX+P was 252 and 228 in the 
FOLFOX-4+BV/XELOX+BV arm. Median time to event (death) was 574 and 551 days respectively, 
resulting in a HR of 0.89 (97.5%CI [0.72; 1.09], p= 0.1921). Only this result is displayed also 
graphically as a Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 5.

NO169662: Overall Survival: KM Curves for Superiority (ITT) 
Rate of Best Overall Response (BOR), investigators’ assessment 
Tumour Response (Investigators’ Assessments): Non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4 
The criteria for non-inferiority were met in the EPP for the overall comparison of FOLFOX-
4/FOLFOX-4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV versus XELOX/XELOX+P/XELOX+BV. For the overall 
comparison in the EPP the BOR was 46.3% vs. 45.5% (HR=0.89, 97.5% CI = [0.72; 1.09]). 
According to the applicant, the non-inferiority criteria was consistently met also in other analysis 
populations (ITT, PPP), and subgroup comparisons. 
For the overall comparison in the EPP, time to response was similar between arms, with the majority 
of responses (approximately 70%) occurring after week 6 and prior to week 18. Duration of response 
was 239 days in 347 patients responding to FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV and 226 days 
in 326 patients responding to XELOX / XELOX + P / XELOX +BV (Hazard ratio=1.02 [0.86;1.22], 
EPP). 
In the EPP population for non-inferiority, duration of complete response could be assessed for only 
14 patients in the comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P/XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-
4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV, 12 patients in the comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P versus FOLFOX-
4/FOLFOX-4+P, and 2 patients in the comparison of XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV. It was not 
possible to draw any conclusions from these limited data. 
BOR (IRC): Non-inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 
Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms (BOR 37.1%) compared with the FOLFOX-4-
containing arms (BOR 38.6%) with respect to BOR as assessed by the IRC was demonstrated in the 
overall comparison (OR=0.94, 97.5% CI = [0.76; 1.16]) and treatment subgroup comparison. 
TTF: Non-inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 
The results of the analyses for time to treatment failure were supportive of the results from the main 
analysis which demonstrated non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4 in regards to PFS. For the 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall comparison in the EPP using the general approach, the TTF was 191 days for FOLFOX arms 
and 179 days for XELOX arms respectively (HR=1.08; 97.5% CI = [0.97; 1.20]). 
Additional Anti-cancer Treatment Taken after Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
There were no major imbalances between XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, XELOX+P versus 
FOLFOX+P, and XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX+BV concerning the proportion of patients receiving 
second-line chemotherapy after disease progression. More patients in the placebo-containing arms 
received second-line chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab-containing arms. The most common 
therapy given as second-line treatment was Irinotecan; the second most frequent agent was 5-FU. 
Irinotecan 33% to 47% 
• 
•  5-FU 22% to 33% 
•  Capecitabine 5% to 16% 
•  Cetuximab 8% to 13% 
•  Bevacizumab 2% to 8% 
Radiotherapy was administered in 7% to 13% of the patients. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the internal consistency of the study and the 
robustness of the findings for the efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS, and BOR. Three categories of 
subgroups were used for the non-inferiority comparisons and for the superiority comparisons: 
•  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
•  Stratification Variables used for Randomization 
•  Geographic Region 
Overall, the subgroup analyses confirmed result as regards to the primary non-inferiority as well as 
primary superiority analysis concerning PFS, OS, and BOR. 
1. 3.   Clinical Safety 
Safety is discussed by using the safety population and overall 3 comparisons: 
•  A pooled XELOX/FOLFOX-4 comparison: pooled safety data from the XELOX arm of the 
initial 2-arm part of the study and the XELOX+P arm of the 2x2 factorial part of the study 
versus the pooled safety data from the FOLFOX-4 arm of the initial 2-arm part of the study 
and the FOLFOX-4+P arm of the 2x2factorial part of the study. 
•  The chemotherapy + bevacizumab (BV) comparisons: 
o  The chemotherapy + BV / chemotherapy + P comparison 
o  The 4-arm comparison: the 4 arms of the 2x2 factorial part of the study (XELOX+P, 
FOLFOX-4+P, FOLFOX-4+BV and XELOX+BV).  
Unless otherwise specified, the safety analysis refers to events occurring during the primary treatment 
phase. 
Exposure to study treatment 
Exposure to study treatment in the primary treatment phase was similar between the XELOX and 
FOLFOX-4 group. 
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment group completed the 48 weeks of treatment, 9% in 
the pooled XELOX group and 7% in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. The median number of cycles 
during the primary study treatment phase was 7 (21 weeks) in the pooled XELOX group and 11 (22 
weeks) in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group; the median duration in days was 162 days in the pooled 
XELOX group and170 days in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. Only a small proportion of patients in 
each group continued into the post-study treatment phase (approximately 5%). The median cumulative 
doses of bolus 5-FU and 5-FU infusion were 14,100.0 mg and 22,025.0 mg, respectively. The median 
cumulative dose of capecitabine was 323,150.0 mg. Median Oxaliplatin cumulative doses were similar 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between pooled treatment groups. As shown in Table 5, relative dose intensity of all components 
decreased over time, but decreased comparably in both arms. 
Table 5 
NO169662: Summary of Relative Dose Intensity by 6-Week Interval: Pooled 
XELOX/FOLFOX-4 Comparison 
The percentage of patients who modified their treatment doses was higher in the FOLFOX-4 groups 
(34.8%) than in the XELOX groups (29.1%). It should be taken into consideration that the cycle 
length of XELOX and FOLFOX-4 were different (3 weeks XELOX and 2 weeks FOLFOX). 
Of note, the applicant performed an analysis of the relationship of dose-modifications and efficacy 
showing both for 5-FU and capecitabine that patients without dose-modifications had the shortest PFS. 
The applicant concludes that dose-modifications do not affect, at least negatively, efficacy. 
The analysis of exposure in the chemotherapy + BV vs. chemotherapy + P comparisons revealed 
nothing significant else than the following: 
The median cumulative doses of the FOLFOX-4 treatment components (5-FU bolus, 5-FU infusion, 
folinic acid, and Oxaliplatin) and the XELOX treatment components (Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin) 
were both higher in the BV groups compared with their corresponding placebo groups. Doses of BV 
were similar between the FOLFOX-4+BV and XELOX+BV groups. However, the median relative 
dose intensities of the treatment components were similar between each BV arm and its corresponding 
placebo arm. 
Pooled XELOX/FOLFOX-4 Comparison 
Overall, tolerability was similar in both treatment groups, with a similar incidence of AEs, SAEs, and 
withdrawals due to AEs. The following key findings were observed: 
•  The incidence of grade 4 AEs was lower in the in the XELOX group compared to the 
FOLFOX-4 group (12.4% vs. 24.8%), a difference driven primarily by haematological events. 
•  The incidence of all haematological AEs (47.6% vs. 69.2%), grade 3/4 haematological AEs 
(15.9% vs. 49.3%), and grade 4 haematological AEs (2.1% vs. 19.1%) were lower in the 
XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 27.5% of patients in the pooled XELOX 
group compared with 58.6% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group, and grade 
3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 7.0% of patients in the pooled XELOX 
group compared with 43.8% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. 
o  Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.9% of patients in the pooled XELOX 
group compared with 4.8% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. 
•  Consistent with this, infections were less common in the XELOX group: all grade (32.2% vs 
45%) and grade 3/4 (7% vs. 10.5%). 
•  Thrombocytopenia (laboratory grade 3/4 abnormalities) was more common in the XELOX 
group (8.2% vs. 4.3%). 
•  The incidence of grade 3/4 increased bilirubin was higher in the XELOX group (3.7% vs 
1.2%); however, this was not accompanied by increased ALAT or ASAT. 
•  The incidence of neurosensory toxicity was similar between the FOLFOX-4 and XELOX 
groups for all AEs and grade 3/4 AEs. 
•  All grade and grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic AEs were lower in the XELOX group 
compared with the FOLFOX-4 group (8.1% vs. 12.9% and 3.8% vs. 6.3%). 
•  Cardiac AEs had a lower incidence in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 
group (all grades: 4.1% vs. 6.2%, grade 3/4: 0.9% vs. 1.4%). 
•  Overall, grade 3/4 gastrointestinal disorders were more common in the XELOX group (32.7% 
vs. 25.4%), mainly due to diarrhoea (20.2% vs. 11.2%) 
•  Stomatitis was lower in the XELOX group (21.4% vs. 37.3%), as was grade 3/4 stomatitis 
(1.2% vs. 2.0%). 
•  All grade PPE was higher in the XELOX group (30.2%) compared to the FOLFOX-4 group 
(10.2%), as was grade 3 PPE (6.1% vs. 1.2%). 
Deaths within 28 days of last dose of study medication were higher in the XELOX group (5.6% vs. 
3.1%), as were deaths within 28 days of the last dose of study medication that were not due to 
progressive disease (4.4% vs. 2.8%); the percentage of all related deaths and related deaths within 28 
days of the last dose of study medication was similar between treatment groups (2.4% vs. 2.2% and 
2.1% vs. 1.7%). 
Chemotherapy + BV / Chemotherapy + P Comparisons 
Overall, tolerability was roughly comparable in both treatment groups. The following key findings 
were observed: 
•  The incidence of grade 3/4 AEs was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms than in the 
chemotherapy + P arms (80.0% vs. 74.8%). 
•  AEs of special interest to chemotherapy, as predefined in the protocol, were seen in a similar 
proportion of patients in the chemotherapy +BV and chemotherapy + P arms, with the 
following exceptions: 
o  The incidence of PPE was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms (grade 3: 
7.1% vs. 3.4%), essentially in the XELOX arms only. 
o  The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was increased in the chemotherapy + 
BV arms (grade 3/4: 32.4% vs. 27.1%), due to higher incidences in a number of 
different events (e.g., diarrhoea, vomiting, and stomatitis) in the BV groups. 
o  The incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events (including cardiac arterial 
thromboembolic events) was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared 
with the chemotherapy + P arms (all grades: 7.8% vs. 5.2%; grade 3/4: 3.5% vs. 
0.4%, respectively). The increase was seen in both treatment subgroups 
(FOLFOX-4 2.9% vs. 0.3%; XELOX 4.0% vs. 0.6%, respectively). 
•  The incidences of AEs of special interest defined for BV were the following: 
o  The incidence of bleeding (all grades of various types) was higher in the 
chemotherapy + BV arms compared with chemotherapy + P (30.5% vs. 25.9%); 
the majority of events were grade 1/2. 
18 
 
 
 
 
o  Thromboembolic events were increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms vs. the 
chemotherapy + P arms, respectively: 
(cid:131)  Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events: 12 patients (1.7%) vs. 7 
(1.0%). 
(cid:131)  Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events: 54 patients (7.8%) vs. 33 
(4.9%). 
o  Hypertension was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with 
chemotherapy + P (grade 3/4: 3.7% vs. 1.2%, respectively). 
o  Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal perforations, proteinuria, and wound healing 
complications were all uncommon. 
•  A higher proportion of patients were discontinued from study treatment for AEs in the BV 
treatment arms (approximately 31% vs. 21%) mainly due to chemotherapy related toxicity; 
21% of the patients in the BV treatment arms versus 15% in the placebo arms discontinued 
therapy due to grade 3/4 AEs. 5% of the patients in the BV treatment arms and 2% in the 
placebo arms had the study treatment discontinued due to AEs of special interest to BV. 
Thirty (4.3%) patients in the chemotherapy + BV arms and 15 (2.2%) patients in the chemotherapy + 
P arms died due to causes other than PD. The incidence of treatment-related deaths was similar in the 
chemotherapy + BV arms and chemotherapy + P arms (2.0% [14 patients] and 1.5% [10 patients], 
respectively). 
The 4 arm comparison did not reveal a safety pattern different from the chemotherapy + BV vs. 
chemotherapy + P comparisons.

Methods 
The design of trial NO16967 is essentially similar to the first part of trial NO169662. I.e., trial 
NO16967 is a randomised controlled, open label phase III trial comparing XELOX and FOLFOX 
(without co-administration of placebo or Bevacizumab). The following are the relevant differences 
compared to the design of trial NO169662: 
a)  Trial NO16967 is a trial in a second line population. An inclusion criterion was explicitly 
patients with inoperable mCRC, who had failed prior treatment with Irinotecan in combination 
with a fluoropyrimide regimen as first-line therapy for their metastatic colorectal carcinoma. 
This criteria was further specified as follows: 
Patients whose disease had recurred or progressed during or within 6 months of completion of 
first-line therapy with the combination of Irinotecan and 5-FU/LV, or patients who stopped 
first-line irinotecan/5-FU/LV combination therapy due to excessive toxicity within the first 8 
weeks, as judged by the treating physician. First line irinotecan + 5-FU/LV included the 
following: 
• 
• 
• 
Irinotecan + 5-FU/LV 
Irinotecan + 5-FU (if infusional 5-FU) 
Irinotecan + 5-FU/LV + concomitant (not sequential) targeted biological agent 
19 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  Primary treatment phase was limited to 24 weeks (in place of 48 weeks), or 8 cycles (arm A = 
XELOX) and 12 cycles (arm B = FOLFOX), respectively. 
c)  At least equivalence of arm A to arm B was concluded if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
CI for the hazard ratio did not exceed 1.30. In trial NO169662 the upper limit was 1.25, and 
the CI considered was the 97.5% CI. 
d)  An additional eligible population (EPP) was not defined. The definition of the PPP of trial 
NO169662 resembles that of trial NO16967. 
Results 
A total of 627 patients from 87 centres in 19 countries were enrolled into study NO16967, 313 and 
314 to the XELODA and FOLFOX arm, respectively. Also centres and countries are similar to trial 
NO169662, i.e. trial NO16967 is a multi-centre, international trial. Distribution of patients was well 
balanced as regards to the stratification (see Table 6), demographic baseline (see Table 7) as well as 
tumour (data not shown) factors.

NO16967: Summary of Demographic Data by Trial Treatment (ITT Population) 
During the primary treatment phase, a similar percentage of XELOX- and FOLFOX-4-treated patients 
were withdrawn (68% and 69%, respectively, see Table 8). 
•  23% of XELOX patients and 16% of FOLFOX-4 patients withdrew for safety reasons. The 
difference in rate was due primarily to withdrawals for adverse events,(64 patients in the 
XELOX group vs. 42 patients in the FOLFOX-4 group). 
•  45% of patients in the XELOX treatment group and 54% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 
treatment group withdrew for non-safety reasons. The difference in rate was due primarily to 
withdrawals for insufficient therapeutic response, i.e., disease progression (143 patients in the 
FOLFOX-4 group vs. 117 patients in the XELOX group).

Results: Primary Endpoint: non-inferiority PFS 
The primary objective of this study was met. Non-inferiority of XELOX compared with FOLFOX-4 in 
terms of PFS in the PPP was demonstrated with a HR of 1.03 and a 95% CI ranging from 0.87 to 1.24 
(Table 9). The upper limit of the 95% CI was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.30. 
Super-imposable Kaplan-Meier curves (see Figure 6) supported non-inferiority. Results in the ITT 
population were consistent with those in the PPP. A non-inferiority analysis using tumour assessments 
by the IRC was supportive of the primary non-inferiority analysis (HR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.17 
in the PPP). 
Analyses of PFS using the on-treatment approach provided the following results: HR = 1.18, 95% CI 
0.95 to 1.47 in the PPP; HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37 in the ITT population.

Although the study was not designed to demonstrate non-inferior OS, the result are at least supportive 
for such a conclusion: For the PPP, the HR was 1.07 and the 95% CI was 0.88 to 1.31 (Table 35). The

Best Overall Response  
Investigators’ Assessments.  
In the PPP, best overall response based on investigators’ assessments was similar for the 2 treatment 
groups (FOLFOX-4 = 20.2%, XELOX = 23.1%). As in the PPP, best overall response in the ITT was 
similar for the 2 treatment groups (FOLFOX-4 = 17.5%, XELOX = 20.1%) although slightly smaller 
compared to the PPP. 
IRC’s assessment 
In the PPP, the best overall response by IRC assessment was similar for the 2 treatment groups 
(FOLFOX-4 = 13.9%, XELOX = 17.5%). As in the PPP, results were similar for the 2 treatment 
groups (FOLFOX-4 = 12.4%, XELOX = 15.3%) in the ITT population. 
Time to Response 
Time to response was similar for the 2 treatment groups, with most of the responses (over 70%) 
occurring after week 6 and prior to week 19. 
Duration of Response 
Because of the small numbers of responses, duration of response was not analyzed in the PPP. 
Duration of response ranged widely and tended to be shorter in the XELOX group (169 days) than in 
the FOLFOX-4 group (190 days). 
Time to Treatment Failure 
The 2 treatment groups were similar in time to treatment failure: 122 and 125 days for 
FOLFOX and XELOX respectively. 
Safety 
In trial NO16967 treatment duration was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 groups: The 
median number of cycles during the primary study treatment phase was 6 (18 weeks) in the XELOX 
group and 8.5 (17 weeks) in the FOLFOX-4 group; the median duration in days was 120 days in the 
XELOX group and 119 days in the FOLFOX-4 group. The median cumulative doses of bolus 5-FU 
and 5-FU infusion were 10449.0 mg and 15917.0 mg, respectively. The median cumulative dose of 
capecitabine was 238000.0 mg. Median oxaliplatin cumulative doses were similar between treatment 
groups (1133.7 and 1160.4 mg respectively). The median total (cumulative) dose intensity of each 
treatment component was high, close to 100%, indicating that patients staying on treatment generally 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received the planned doses, with few or no dose reductions. Of note, the applicant analysed the effect 
of dose modification on efficacy in terms of PFS in patients who modified their capecitabine or 5-FU 
doses through dose interruptions, dose reductions and dose delays compared to those who did not 
modify their doses was performed. The analysis of the impact of dose modification on efficacy shows 
that dose modifications are not associated with decreased efficacy with respect to PFS (rather, the 
contrary effect might be seen, i.e., PFS is slightly longer in patients with dose modifications compared 
to patients without). 
Overall, tolerability was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 treatment groups. The key 
findings are as follows: 
• 
There was a similar incidence of adverse events (related and all), serious adverse events 
(related and all), withdrawals during the primary treatment phase, and deaths (related, all, up 
to 28 days after last dose, and within 60 days of treatment start). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
o  Deaths up to 28 days after the last dose of study medication that were not due to 
disease progression were slightly higher in the FOLFOX-4 group (2.9% vs. 1.3%) 
o  Withdrawals due to adverse events in the primary treatment phase were higher in the 
XELOX treatment group (20.6% vs. 13.6%) 
A lower incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in the XELOX group compared to the 
FOLFOX-4 group (60.1% vs. 72.4%). The incidence of grade 4 events was also lower in the 
XELOX group compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (4.8% vs. 22.7%). 
The incidence of all haematological adverse events (30.5% vs. 57.1%), grade 3/4 
haematological adverse events (10.0% vs. 40.6%), and grade 4 haematological adverse events 
(1.3% vs. 15.3%) were lower in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group. 
o  Neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 18.0% of patients in the XELOX group 
compared with 48.4% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group, and grade 3/4 
neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 4.5% of patients in the XELOX group 
compared with 35.1% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group. 
o  Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.3% of patients in the XELOX group 
compared with 3.6% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group. 
Infections were less common in the XELOX group: all grade (22.8% vs 33.8%) and grade 3/4 
(4.2% vs. 6.2%). 
All grade and grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic adverse events were slightly lower in the 
XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group (4.2% vs. 7.5% and 1.9% vs. 4.2%), 
while arterial thromboembolic events were similar between the 2 groups (all grade: 1.6% 
XELOX, 0.6% FOLFOX-4; grade 3/4: 1.0% XELOX, 0.3% FOLFOX-4) 
Cardiac adverse events had a lower incidence in the FOLFOX-4 group compared with the 
XELOX group (2.6% vs. 4.2%), but the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events was the same in 
each treatment group (0.6%). 
Overall, grade 3/4 gastrointestinal disorders were more common in the XELOX group (32.8% 
vs. 19.8%), mainly due to grade 3/4 diarrhoea (19.9% vs. 4.9%). All grade diarrhoea was also 
more common in the XELOX treatment group (56.9% vs. 48.7%). 
Stomatitis was lower in the XELOX group (13.5% vs. 30.2%). 
The incidence of neurosensory toxicity was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 
groups for all grade (71.4% vs. 73.1%, respectively) and grade 3/4 adverse events (8.7% vs. 
8.4%, respectively). 
All grade PPE was higher in the XELOX group (22.5%) compared to the FOLFOX-4 group 
(5.8%), as was grade 3 PPE (3.5% vs. 0.6%). 
Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities: 
o  Low WBC was more common in the FOLFOX-4 group compared with the XELOX 
group (15.6% vs. 0.6%), as was low neutrophil count (39.6% vs. 5.5%). 
o  The incidence of increased bilirubin was low and similar between the treatment 
groups (2.6% XELOX and 1.9% FOLFOX-4), as were increased ALAT (0.6% 
XELOX and 0.3% FOLFOX-4) and increased ASAT (1.0% XELOX and 0.6% 
FOLFOX-4). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
25 
 
 
Following the Positive Opinion for Advanced Gastric Cancer on 22 February 2007, Roche committed 
to  provide  by  end  April  2007  a  proposed  analysis  plan  for  a  Meta-analysis  of  the  large  database 
represented  by  the  studies  that  are  currently  described  in  the  SPC  as  well  as  the  additional  studies 
(NO16966;  NO16967;  NO16968)  for  factors  causing  Hand  Foot  Syndrome  (HFS)  and  other  major 
[S]AEs, and for correlation of these [S]AEs with efficacy . It was agreed in this time that the results of 
the  meta-analysis,  including  studies  NO16966  and  NO16967  would  need  to  be  submitted  with 
Responses to Request for Supplementary Information for mCRC Type II Variation Application. 
This  commitment  was  enforced  and  further  précised  within  a  pre-submission  meeting  with  the 
Rapporteur on March 2, 2007. 
For safety data, a pooled analysis of trials NO16966 and NO16967 is available. 
3.3 
Overall discussion on Clinical safety 
As presented, the safety data for XELOX (+/-BV) do no suggest a safety profile relevantly different 
from  FOLFOX  (+/-BV)  else  than  the  known  differences  between  capecitabine  and  5-FU 
monotherapeutic safety profiles. Clinical safety of FOLFOX is well established, and exchange of 5-FU 
by capecitabine does not add any relevant safety problem. The differences in patterns can be described 
that the myelotoxicity of FOLFOX is replaced by diarrhoea, and PPE by XELOX. The neurotoxicity 
of Oxaliplatin is unaffected by this exchange. 
For  a  more  specific  summary  of  safety  of  XELOX  (and  capecitabine)  the  result  of  the  already 
announced meta-analysis should be awaited. 
No specific risk management actions are planned for this indication. This is based upon the fact that 
the safety profile exhibited during the clinical trials covered by this application does not differ in any 
way from the well-established safety profile of capecitabine in CRC. A summary of the known 
identified safety concerns, along with the PhV proposed activities and proposed risk minimization

1. 4. OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment 
Results of trials NO169662 and NO16967, investigating the same schedule in the same tumour at first 
and second-line treatment, are rather consistent as regards to efficacy and safety. Prognosis/efficacy in 
terms of OS, PPS, and BOR differ as expected. As both trials (at least the first part of trial NO169662) 
could have been performed also as a single but stratified (according to the line of treatment), there is 
no objection against a combined analysis of both trials.  
In terms of efficacy, XELOX proved to be non-inferior to FOLFOX both in a first and a second line 
population. The sensitivity analyses did not consistently endorse the robustness of this conclusion in 
the first line population in terms of the primary endpoint PFS. In both pivotal Phase III trials NO16966 
and  NO16967  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  PFS  (primary)  and  OS  (secondary  endpoint)  has  been 
demonstrated. e.g., in the (by the CHMP requested ) pooled analysis of both trials HR and 95%-CI for 
PFS and OS (PPP, surgery not censored) were 1.00 [0.88; 1.14] and 1.01 [0.87; 1.17].  
The CHMP discussed concerns related to  incongruent result of investigators and IRC assessment in 
terms  of  PFS  in  966.  It  seems  that  IRC  but  not  investigators  assessment  likely  biased  –  as  already 
shown with the original submission by the MAH/applicant and with Responses to LoQ. Non-inferior 
OS supporting PFS assessment of investigators but not IRC!   
There  were  more  “PFS”  events  on  treatment  with  XELOX  vs.  FOLFOX  in  966  and  967,  however, 
since Xeloda is administered as an (oral) continuous 14 day schedule (but not 5-FU and Oxaliplatin, 
i.e. once every 3 weeks) this is an expected result and a phenomenon already observed in prior MAA-
trials large 95%-CI in 966. HR, however, nearly precisely 1. At least in first line treatment the non-
inferiority  (which  has  been  demonstrated)  result  is  not  so  robust  to  further  sensitivity  analysis.  The 
CHMP    discussed  this  not  fully  convincing  robustness  insofar  as  this  is  the  first  time  that  oral 
capecitabine is not compared with bolus 5-FU, but (at least in part) with continuously infused 5-FU. In 
general, continuous 5-FU infusion is considered as more efficacious but less convenient than bolus 5-
FU.  The lack of robustness of the non-inferiority conclusion in comparisons with infusional 5-FU is 
addressed in section 5.1 of the SPC.  
As  non-inferiority  of  capecitabine  and  5-FU  monotherapy  has  already  been  proven  in  the  same 
indication,  it  appears  that  5-FU  in  general  can  be  replaced  by  capecitabine  while  not  affecting  the 
efficacy profile but changing the safety pattern. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  safety  profile  of  XELOX  is  different  from  FOLFOX.  It  is,  however,  overall  not  worse.  The 
overall higher frequency of grade III/IV AEs for FOLFOX should not be over-interpreted (in favour of 
XELOX)  as  they  were  mainly  due  to  haematological  AEs.  In  addition,  PPE  grade  is  higher  with 
XELOX. 
In  a  combination  therapy  the  advantage  of  the  oral  administration  of  capecitabine  becomes  a  less 
relevant favourable aspect than in monotherapy as the combination partner is already administered i.v. 
In  conclusion  safety  of  XELOX  and  FOLFOX  overall  “similar/comparable”  although  with  some 
differences in the pattern. Overall, the risk-benefit relationship of capecitabine in mCRC is acceptable 
and  comparable  to  5-FU.  Therefore,  a  general  indication  of  Xeloda  “in  the  treatment  of  metastatic 
colorectal cancer” is supported.

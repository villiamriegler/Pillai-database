3.1. 
Introduction 
Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to 
human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
Adalimumab is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA).  
Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  disorder  of  unknown  cause  that  involves 
primarily  the  sacroiliac  joints  and  the  axial  skeleton.  Clinical  manifestations  usually  begin  in  the 
second  or  third  decade,  and  include  lower  back  pain  with  predominant  nocturnal  pain  and  morning 
stiffness. Chest pain, pain and swelling of peripheral joints and extra-articular tenderness may occur as 
well  as  several  extraskeletal  manifestations  such  as  acute  anterior  uveitis  (severe  inflammatory  eye 
disease),  cardiac  conduction  defects,  aortic  valve  disease  or  renal  disease,  mainly  in  the  form  of 
secondary renal amyloidosis.  
The male to female prevalence is estimated to be 2-3:1. AS is a largely genetically determined disease 
correlated  with  the  histocompatibility  antigen  HLA-B27  (human  leukocyte  antigen  B27)  and  occurs 
worldwide  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  prevalence  of  this  antigen.  The  association  with  B27  is 
independent of disease severity. 
AS  is  an  immunologically  mediated  disease  state  in  which  TNF  is  present  as  a  cytokine  mediating 
inflammation in the axial skeleton. Increased concentration of TNF in joints has also been shown. 
The  MAH  submitted  2  clinical  studies  (M03-607  and  M03-606)  conducted  in  patients  with  AS  to 
support  an  indication  for  adalimumab,  administered  at  a  dose  of  40 mg  subcutaneously  (sc)  every 
other week (eow), for "reducing the signs and symptoms of active ankylosing spondylitis". 
The MAH proposed to amend the text of the SPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 with the results of the 
above-mentioned studies, and to update the PL accordingly. 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
To  support  the  indication  the  MAH  submitted  2  pivotal  clinical  studies  designed  primarly  for  the 
evaluation  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  adalimumab  in  patients  with  active  AS.  They  were  phase 3, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, multicentre studies designed to demonstrate the safety 
and efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of active AS in subjects who had an inadequate response 
or were intolerance to one or more non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(s) (NSAIDs) and who  may 
have had additionally failed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy.  
3.2.1  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity 
The  clinical  pharmacology  (PK/PD)  and  immunogenicity  of  adalimumab  have  been  characterised  in 
healthy subjects as well as in RA subjects. 
PK  analyses  of  trough  concentrations  were  performed  in  study  M03-607.  The  medium  adalimumab 
apparent clearance (CL/F) value was 13.3 ml/h, which was lower than that observed in patients with 
RA (18 ml/h). This finding was consistent with the observation that the mean trough concentrations of 
adalimumab  (6-7 µg/ml)  observed  in  patients  with  active  AS  after  treatment  with  sc  adalimumab 
40 mg eow as monotherapy were slightly higher than those observed in subjects with RA (5 µg/ml) in 
monotherapy.  However,  the  true  magnitude  of  the  difference  in  CL/F  between  the  two  populations 
cannot be adequately quantified due to differences in timing of sample collection.

The  median  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (V/F)  of  adalimumab  in  subjects  with  AS  (11.4  l)  was 
comparable to the observed in subjects with RA (11.2 l). 
Although the exposure to adalimumab in AS subjects on monotherapy appeared to be slightly higher, 
the safety profile from the study M03-607 in the AS population was considered favourable and similar 
to the data from the RA population.  
The immunogenicity of adalimumab was evaluated in study M03-607. Subjects were classified as anti-
adalimumab antibody positive (AAA+) if they tested AAA+ at weeks 12 or 24  of treatment. Overall, 
the  AAA+  rate  for  adalimumab-treated  subjects  was  8%  within  the  first  24  weeks  (adalimumab  9% 
[16/185], adalimumab plus MTX 5% [1/19]).   
The  CHMP  requested  supplementary  information  related  to  the  potential  relationship  between  the 
presence  of  antibodies  and  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes,  as  well  as  concomitant  use  of 
MTX/DMARD.  Further  to  the  assessment  of  supplementary  information,  the  CHMP  concluded  that 
the data are too limited to draw definitive conclusions regarding the impact of AAA on both efficacy 
and safety. 
3.2.2  Clinical efficacy 
Studies M03-607 and M03-606 
Study participants 
The  study  participants  were  adults  above  18  years  of  age,  with  AS  at  baseline,  as  defined  by  the 
modified New York criteria1. Subjects had a diagnosis of active AS, as defined by a fulfilment of at 
least 2 of the following 3  criteria: bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score ≥4, visual analog 
scale (VAS) score for total back pain ≥40 mm (4 cm) and/or morning stiffness ≥1 hour. Subjects were 
allowed  to  continue  on  sulfasalazine  (SSZ)  (≤3  g/day)  and/or  MTX  (≤25  mg/week)  and/or 
hydroxychloroquine (≤400 mg/day) and/or prednisone (≤10  mg/day) (and/or prednisone equivalents) 
and/or NSAIDs as long as these doses remained stable for 4 weeks prior to baseline. Patients who had 
been treated with anti-TNF therapy were excluded. 
The majority of subjects were men (76%), Caucasian (95%) and the median age was 42 years.  
In  both  studies,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  similar  except  that  patients  with  total  spinal 
ankylosis  were  included  in  Study  M03-607  (not  to  exceed  10%  of  total  enrolment),  but  excluded  at 
screening from Study M03-606. 
The inclusion criteria were considered acceptable.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 (M03-607) or 1:1 (M03-606) ratio to each of the 2 treatment groups. 
In total, patients received adalimumab 40 mg eow sc (n=246) or matching placebo (n=151) during the 
24-week placebo controlled period. The 24 week period of each study was followed by an open-label 
period during which subjects received adalimumab for up to an additional 80 weeks. The studies were 
unblinded after all subjects completed the 24-week double-blind portion. 
1 Modified New York criteria 
1. History: low back pain ≥ 3 months improved by exercise and not relieved by rest;  
2. Examination: limitation of lumbar spine in sagittal and frontal planes; chest expansion relative to normal 
values corrected for age and sex;  
3. Radiology: bilateral sacro-iliitis grade 2 (minimal abnormality)-4 (severe abnormality) or unilateral sacro-
iliitis grade 3 (unequivocal abnormality)-4.

Subjects who failed to achieve ASAS2 20 response criteria at the weeks 12, 16 or 20 visit could:  
1. Remain on blinded study medication through week 24; or 
2. Initiate open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow (early escape open-label, EEOL); or 
3. Discontinue study medication and participation in the trial 
Subjects  who  completed  24  weeks  of  blinded  therapy  and  who  failed  to  achieve  ASAS  20  response 
criteria on or after the week 36 visit (i.e., after 12 weeks of open-label treatment of adalimumab 40 mg 
eow) could: 
1. Increase the frequency of adalimumab to 40 mg weekly; or 
2. Discontinue study medication and participation in the trial. 
Further  to  the  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  MAH  submitted  the  safety  data  for  the 
38 patients in open label treatment that received 40 mg of adalimumab weekly. No conclusions could 
be drawn as the number of patients was limited, although there did not appear to be any increase in 
adverse events. 
Regarding concomitant treatment, the dose of corticosteroids, MTX, SSZ, or hydrochloroquine should 
not  have  been  initiated  or  increased  before  week  36.  However,  the  dose  of  corticosteroids  could  be 
decreased, or completely eliminated after week 24 at the investigator's discretion. The dose of MTX, 
SSZ, or hydrochloroquine should not have been decreased prior to week 36. 
The  design  of  the  studies  was  considered  acceptable,  however,  the  EEOL  option  was  considered  to 
add difficulties in the interpretation of the efficacy data beyond week 12.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints in both trials were reduction of signs and symptoms as measured with 
the  ASAS  20  response  at  week  12  and  inhibition  of  progression  of  structural  damage  in  spine  as 
measured with the change of the modified stoke AS spine score (mSASSS) from baseline to week 104.  
The data relating to the inhibition of progression of structural damage in spine will be assessed when 
available. 
ASAS 20 response was defined as improvement of at least 20% and absolute improvement of at least 
10  units  on  a  0-100mm  scale  from  baseline  in  at  least  3  of  the  following  4  components:  Patient’s 
Global  Assessment  of  disease  activity,  pain  assessment  represented  by  total  back  pain,  function 
represented  by  the  Bath  AS  functional  index  (BASFI),  and  inflammation  (morning  stiffness).  An 
ASAS  responder  must  have  shown  an  absence  of  deterioration  in  the  potential  remaining  domain, 
where deterioration was defined as a worsening of ≥20% and a net worsening of ≥10 units (on a scale 
of 0-100).  
The major secondary endpoints included: 
(cid:190) ASAS 20 response at week 24 
(cid:190) ASAS 50 and ASAS 703 response at weeks 12 and 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in BASDAI (Bath AS disease activity index) score at weeks 12 and 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in BASFI (Bath AS functional index) at weeks 12 and 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in CRP (C-reactive protein) at weeks 12 and 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in the Bath AS metrology index (BASMI) at weeks 12 and 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in SF-36 (36 item short form health survey) physical component summary at 
week 24 
(cid:190) Change from baseline in the AS quality of life questionnaire (ASQoL) at week 24 
2 ASAS: Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis Working Group (see Outcomes/endpoints). 
3 ASAS 50: improvement of at least 50% and absolute improvement of at least 20 units response from baseline 
in at least 3 of 4 domains as defined for ASAS 20, , without deterioration in the potential remaining domain. 
ASAS 70: improvement of at least 70% and absolute improvement of at least 30 units response from baseline in 
at least 3 of 4 domains as defined for ASAS 20, , without deterioration in the potential remaining domain. 
Deterioration for ASAS50 and ASAS70 is defined as a change for the worse of atleast 20% and a net worsening 
of at least 10 units.

Statistical design 
In total, 397 subjects were enrolled in both studies.  
ASAS  20  response  rates  of  the  adalimumab  group  were  compared  with  the  placebo  group  using 
Pearson's Chi-square test. Analysis was conducted as a non-responder imputation so any subject who 
discontinued or had missing values at week 12 was considered a non-responder at subsequent visits. 
The secondary efficacy analyses of the primary efficacy variable were supportive.  
To  assess  the  impact  of  the  missing  data,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  if  the  analysis  of  the 
ASAS 20 at week 12 demonstrated significant difference between adalimumab and placebo.  
Results 
Patients disposition 
Both studies had nearly identical populations, dosing regimens and primary and secondary endpoints.  
M03-607 
The median disease duration at baseline was approximately 8 years. Approximately 56% of subjects 
were not on DMARD treatment. At baseline, 79% of the subjects had concomitant NSAID and 10% of 
the  subjects  had concomitant  corticosteroid treatments. Seventy nine  percent  of subjects  were HLA-
B27 positive.  
Through 12 weeks of double blind study drug administration, 98% of the adalimumab treated subjects 
and 96% of the placebo treated subjects completed the study.  
At week 24, around 94% of the subjects were still enrolled in the study, and 27% of subjects originally 
randomised to placebo completed week 24 while remaining on double blind study drug. Sixty seven 
percent of subjects originally randomised to placebo entered the early escape group and received open-
label adalimumab. A total of 155 subjects entered the EEOL. Among subjects originally randomised to 
adalimumab, 58% completed through week 24 on double blind study drug while 36% entered the early 
escape group.  
Six percent of subjects originally randomised to placebo and 6% of subjects originally randomised to 
adalimumab were discontinued from the study prior to week 24. The main reasons for discontinuation 
were  adverse  events  (approximately  2%  of  placebo  treated  subjects  and  3%  of  adalimumab  treated 
subjects) 
M03-606 
The  median  disease  duration  at  baseline  was  13  years.  Approximately  66%  of  subjects  were  not  on 
DMARD  treatment.  At  baseline,  90%  of  the  subjects  had  concomitant  NSAID  and  16%  of  subjects 
had concomitant corticosteroids treatments. Eighty four percent of subjects were HLA-B27 positive.  
Through  12  weeks  of  double  blind  study  drug  administration,  100%  of  the  adalimumab  and  the 
placebo treated subjects completed the study. 
At week 24, around 98% of the subjects were still enrolled in the study.

M03-607 
The  results  from  the  24  week  double  blind  portion  of  study  M03-607  showed  that  statistically 
significant  differences  were  observed  between  adalimumab  and  placebo  treatments  in  the  primary 
endpoint,  ASAS  12  at  week  12.  Statistical  significant  differences  were  also  observed  for  other 
secondary endpoints. 
Of  note,  155  subjects  entered  EEOL  adalimumab  at  week  12.  Of  these,  74  subjects  in  the  placebo 
treatment  group  received  EEOL  therapy,  55%  of  which  were  ASAS  20  responders  at  week  16.  In 
comparison,  at week  16,  of  the  78 subjects in the adalimumab  treatment  group  who  received EEOL 
therapy, 31% of subjects were ASAS 20 responders. This response rate increased over the remaining 
weeks. 
M03-606 
Similar  trends  (not  all  statistically  significant)  were  seen  in  the  smaller  randomised,  double − blind, 
placebo controlled Study M03-606 of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.   
For the primary analysis, 47% of the subjects in the adalimumab treatment group achieved a week 12 
ASAS 20 response compared to 27% of the subjects in the placebo treatment group. This difference 
did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06). The same pattern was observed for the analysis of the 
secondary endpoint ASAS 20 at week 24.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Overall, considering the pooled data, statistically significant differences towards placebo were reached 
in most efficacy endpoints at week 12. Fifty seven percent of adalimumab treated subjects combined 
across both studies achieved an ASAS 20 response at week 12, compared to 23% of placebo treated 
patients  (p<0.001).  At  week  24,  48%  of  adalimumab  treated  subjects  combined  across  both  studies 
achieved ASAS 20 response compared to 17% of placebo treated subjects (p<0.001).  
In  study  M03-607  efficacy  was  shown  with  ASAS  20  and  its  components  at  weeks  12  and  24. 
However, the number of patients fulfilling criteria for non-response at week 12 and entering into the 
EEOL  group  was  high  in  both  the  placebo  and  active  groups.  Although  the  proportion  of  non-
responders was similar to  other approved indications for adalimumab, the design of this  study made 
further interpretation of efficacy results difficult. 
Further  to  the  CHMP  request  for  supplementary  information,  subgroup  analyses  of  the  BASDAI 
response  were  performed.  The  results  showed  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  treatment  difference 
between subgroups.  
The  observed responses  were  similar in subjects who were  HLA-B27  positive  as  compared  to those 
who were negative. The number of subjects treated concomitantly with MTX or other DMARD was 
relatively low. However, no significant difference in response was observed between the groups.  
The  CHMP  expressed  concerns  relating  to  intermittent  treatment.  The  mean  duration  of  interval 
between given doses was 42 days. However, a longer interval was considered of interest. The MAH 
committed to further investigate this issue.  
3.2.3  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In  both  M03-607  and  M03-606,  397  subjects  were  randomised  to  1  of  the  2  treatment  groups.  The 
safety was determined from the 24 week double blind periods of the two pivotal studies.  
The  mean  exposure  for  the  393  subjects  receiving  any  adalimumab  in  the  combined  analysis  was 
248.5 days (median exposure 259 days). All subjects who enrolled in the two studies received at least 
2 weeks of exposure to adalimumab until the cut-off date. As of the cut-off date, 6% of subjects had 
been exposed to the drug for more than 52 weeks. 
Exposure to adalimumab within the sought indication was considered sufficient by the CHMP.  
Adverse events (AE) 
All subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the safety analysis. The 
safety of adalimumab in AS was determined through an evaluation of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs 
of interest (malignancy, lymphoma, tuberculosis (TB)/granulomatous infections, demyelination, drug-
induced  lupus,  and  congestive  heart  failure  [CHF]),  clinical  laboratory  evaluations,  physical 
examinations, and vital signs. 
During the AS clinical development  program, a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as  any 
AE with onset or worsening reported by a subject from the time that the first dose of study drug was 
administered  until  five  adalimumab  half-lives  (70  days)  had  elapsed  following  discontinuation  of 
study drug administration. 
M03-607 
Up to week 24, a higher percentage of adalimumab-treated subjects experienced a TEAE compared to 
placebo-treated subjects.  
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No deaths, malignancies, or serious infectious were reported by adalimumab treated subjects.  
There were two reported cases of drug hypersensitivity, one considered not related to the study drug in 
a placebo treated subject and one considered as probably related in an adalimumab treated subject.  
No  events  of  TB/granulomatous  infections,  demyelination,  drug-induced  lupus  or  congestive  heart 
failure were reported by adalimumab treated subjects.  
The mean changes from baseline in serum chemistry values observed in adalimumab-treated subjects 
were small.  The  increases in cholesterol  and triglycerides to a  more normal  value  observed  in study 
M03-607 were similar to the ones observed in previous studies for RA and PsA.  
(8)  adalimumab-treated  subjects  had  post-baseline  ALT 
(alanine  aminotransferase) 
Eight 
values ≥3.0 x upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN).  Six  of  these  8  subjects  had  abnormally  high  values  at 
baseline; the remaining 2 subjects had a single post-baseline ALT elevation that resolved on continued 
treatment with adalimumab. Two of the 8 subjects had AEs reported in association with elevated ALT 
values.  
The most common reported AEs (incidence ≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (13% for adalimumab and 8% 
for placebo treated groups) and headache (10% for adalimumab and 8% for placebo treated groups).  
As  compared  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  adalimumab,  no  new  safety  signals  were  found  in  this 
study.  
M03-606 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs,  irrespective  of  relationship  to  study  drug,  was 
higher  in  the  adalimumab  than  placebo  treatment  groups.  The  incidence  of  infectious  AEs  was  also 
higher  in  adalimumab  treated  groups  as  compared  to  placebo  group.  Most  of  the  infectious  AEs 
reported in either treatment group were mild or moderate in severity. 
The  most  common  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis  (18%  for  adalimumab  and  11%  for  placebo 
treated groups), headache (13% for adalimumab and 7% for placebo treated groups), upper respiratory 
tract  infection  (13%  for  adalimumab  and  2%  for  placebo  treated  groups),  arthralgia  (11%  for 
adalimumab and 12% for placebo treated groups) and dizziness (5% for both groups).  
Risk management plan (RMP), pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisation plan 
The risk management plan submitted was specific to the AS clinical program and patient population. 
The  currently  identified  risks  for  adalimumab  will  continue  to  be  monitored.  Events  of  interest  will 
continue to be analysed in the periodic safety updated reports (PSURs), and are noted in the long-term 
studies and registries which are currently ongoing. As no new risks were identified in the AS clinical 
program, the relevant sections of the SPC will be updated as more information becomes available from 
the  post  authorisation  commitments  or  clinical  experience.  With  regard  to  monitoring  of  potential 
safety  signals  associated  with  adalimumab,  the  MAH  has  agreed  to  various  follow-up  measures 
(FUMs) in previous applications. Any potential safety issues and associated action plans identified in 
the course of these FUMs will be applied as appropriate to the AS population. 
The  MAH  will  continue  to  collect  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  data.  Additionally,  the  routine 
pharmacovigilance practices, and safety monitoring beyond routine pharmacovigilance undertaken as 
part of FUMs will continue.  
In conclusion, as no new safety concerns were observed in the AS population as compared to the large 
RA  and  PsA  clinical  databases  and  post-marketing  experience,  no  new  risk  minimisation  measures 
were proposed. Existing risk minimisation measures already in place are applicable to the AS.

Discussion on clinical safety 
In the performed studies no new safety signals were found.  
At  week  12,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  (p=0.012)  in  the  AEs  reported  in  the 
adalimumab group (72%, 177 subjects) when compared to the placebo (60%, 90 subjects) group. At 
Week 24, there was a statistically significant difference in the AEs reported in the adalimumab group 
(p=0.001),  AEs  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  (p=0.002),  and  infectious  AEs  (p=0.006) 
when compared to the placebo group. At Week 24, severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and 
serious  infectious  AEs  showed  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  adalimumab  and 
placebo for the Controlled Studies. Adverse events at least possibly drug-related were more common 
in  adalimumab  treated  subjects  (adalimumab:  35.0%;  placebo:  20.5%);  with  attribution  of  injection 
site reactions (adalimumab: 10.2%, placebo: 4.6%) and infectious AEs (adalimumab: 21.2 %, placebo: 
34.1%). 
The  most  common  TEAEs  (occurring  in  ≥5%  of  subjects)  in  either  the  combined  adalimumab  or 
placebo  treatment  groups  of  the  controlled  studies  were  nasopharyngitis  (13%),  headache  (11%), 
Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (7%)  and  fatigue  (5),  were  reported  more  frequently  at  week  24  in 
adalimumab-treated subjects. 
Laboratory  monitoring identified that  ALT elevations (>3  x ULN) were  observed in  9 (6  during the 
double-blind period and 3 during the open-label period) adalimumab treated subjects.  
One malignancy (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was reported in the open-label period.  
There  were  no  TB/granulomatous  infections,  demyelination,  drug  induced  lupus,  or  CHF  reported 
during the open label.  
The  risk  management  plan  was  specific  to  the  AS  clinical  program  and  patient  population.  It  was 
noted  that  there  were  no  safety  issues  specific  to  the  AS  patient  population  observed  in  the  clinical 
program. Therefore, no additional risk minimisation measures were proposed. 
3.3.  Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
The MAH submitted 2 pivotal studies to support the use of adalimumab in AS. Patients included in 
these  studies  had  similar  disease  activity,  similar  baseline  characteristics  and  similar  concomitant 
treatments as in previous anti-TNFs approved for treatment of AS. 
In study M03-607, the primary endpoint, ASAS 20, was statistically significantly superior to placebo. 
However,  in  the  smaller  study  M03-606,  statistically  significant  superiority  in  ASAS  20  was  not 
reached  but  statistical  significance  was  reached  in  most  secondary  endpoints.  Despite  the  lack  of 
statistical significance for the primary endpoint in this smaller study, efficacy is generally supported 
based on the totality of data.  
Discussions  were  held  whether  ASAS20  as  a  goal  when  using  a  TNF-α  blocker  seems  too  low. 
Consideration was given to the ASAS recommendation, that response to therapy be assessed by a 50% 
reduction or fall of two or more units in BASDAI. The MAH was therefore requested to provide data 
on BASDAI 50 response in patients with active disease (BASDAI score at baseline >4). The results of 
this subgroup analysis were consistent with the results of the previously submitted subgroup analyses 
in that adalimumab subjects achieved a greater clinical response when compared with placebo within 
each subgroup, and that there is no evidence of a treatment difference between the subgroups. 
At baseline, the  majority of patients had no concomitant DMARD therapy. However, approximately 
20% were on DMARD therapy, which was allowed during the study. Although the data are limited, 
further analyses indicate that efficacy and safety have been shown in both populations. This was also 
found in additional subgroup analyses of patients positive and negative for HLA-B27.  
In responding subjects, efficacy was generally achieved within a short time period after initiation of 
treatment.  However,  some  patients  will  likely  not  gain  benefit  (non-responders),  and  in  those 
termination of treatment should be considered.

No TB, opportunistic infections, malignancies or deaths occurred in the blinded period of the studies. 
One  benign  lung  neoplasm  and  one  Hodgkin´s  lymphoma  were  found  during  open-label  treatment. 
The  safety  of  adalimumab  in  the  claimed  indication  was  considered  similar  to  the  already  known 
safety profile in other approved indications. 
The  MAH  has  submitted  a  risk  management  plan  that  was  considered  acceptable.  In  addition,  the 
changes proposed to the product information reflect the information currently available on the claimed 
indication and were agreed with.  
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  risk/benefit  balance  for  adalimumab  treatment  40  mg  e.o.w.,  in  AS, 
with  the  following  indication  :  Humira/Trudexa'  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  severe 
active  ankylosing  spondylitis  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to  conventional  therapy  is 
positive.  
IV. 
 CONCLUSION 
On  27  April  2006  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, and Package Leaflet, based 
on  the  observations  and  the  appropriate  conclusions,  and  subject  to  the  post  authorisation 
commitments undertaken by the MAH.

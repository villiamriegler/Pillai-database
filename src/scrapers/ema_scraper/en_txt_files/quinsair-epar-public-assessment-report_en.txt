2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening and chronically debilitating disease that greatly affects patient quality of life 
and significantly reduces survival. Median survival is currently around 40 years [CFF Registry, 2011] and 
[CFT, 2013]. Patients with CF suffer from chronic infections of the lower respiratory tract that can be caused by 
multiple bacteria, particularly P. aeruginosa [LiPuma, 2010]. Chronic pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa is 
difficult to eradicate and is implicated as the major cause of lung function decline, with associated morbidity and 
mortality.  
Approximately 20% of patients with CF aged up to 5 years are infected with P. aeruginosa; from the age of 6 to 
10 years, the prevalence of P. aeruginosa infection increases, with over 40% of patients aged 11 to 17 years and 
over 60% aged 18 to 24 years infected. By the age of 25 to 34 years approximately 80% of patients with CF are 
infected with P. aeruginosa [CFF Registry, 2011]. Chronic infection with this pathogen is associated with 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 10/106 
 
  
  
  
episodes of pulmonary exacerbations and decreasing lung function over time, presumably related to 
inflammation triggered by bacteria and their toxins [Gibson et al., 2003]. The prevalence of CF in the 
European Union has been estimated as 0.765/10,000 and the population rates of chronic P. aeruginosa infection 
among CF patients from 0.214 to 0.274 per 10,000 among patients <19 years of age, 0.449 to 0.577 per 10,000 
among patients aged 19 years and above, and 0.387 to 0.497 per 10,000 among the total population [Maier 
2013]. 
While P. aeruginosa is the pathogen most frequently associated with pulmonary complications in patients with 
CF, studies have demonstrated the complex microbiome of the CF lung. Other non-fermenting gram-negative 
bacilli (NF-GNB) that cause chronic infections in CF include Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter spp. 
and Burkholderia spp. [Steinkamp et al., 2005]. Infections with some species of Burkholderia spp. have been 
associated with poor outcomes and death in patients with CF [Gibson et al., 2003]; [Courtney et al., 2004]. 
More recently, chronic infection with Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin resistant strains (MRSA), has 
been associated with increased pulmonary inflammation and poor outcomes in patients with CF [Dasenbrook 
et al., 2008]; [Sagel et al., 2009]. Other authors have described the potential importance of microaerophilic 
streptococci and anaerobes in the CF lung [Sibley et al., 2008]; [Tunney et al., 2008].  
Current management of chronic pulmonary infections in CF includes IV, oral, and inhaled antimicrobial therapies 
that are aimed at maintaining lung function. Over the past decade, inhaled nebulized antimicrobials have 
become a standard part of maintenance therapy in patients with CF with documented chronic P. aeruginosa 
infection. Aerosol delivery of antimicrobials directly to the lung increases the concentration of antimicrobial at 
the site of infection, resulting in enhanced bacterial killing as compared to systemic administration. Aerosol 
administration can also improve the safety index of some drugs by diminishing the risk of systemic toxicities 
[Gibson et al., 2003]. The currently approved inhalational antimicrobials for use in chronically infected CF 
patients within the EU are tobramycin (TOBI®, TOBI Podhaler, Bramitob®), colistimethate (ColoBreathe®, 
Colomycin®, Promixin®) and aztreonam (Cayston®) and in the US are tobramycin (TOBI®, TOBI Podhaler) 
and aztreonam (Cayston®). 
There is substantial evidence in the literature that the respiratory response to nebulized tobramycin becomes 
attenuated in individuals with CF after extended exposure [Ramsey et al., 1999]; [VanDevanter and Geller, 
2011]. It has been shown that this reduced response does not directly correlate with decreased in vitro 
tobramycin susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa isolates [Ramsey et al., 1999] but rather appears to be caused by 
the adoption of bacterial growth strategies that support antimicrobial tolerance. The two best-recognized 
strategies that bacteria employ are the formation of biofilms and the creation of non-multiplying “persister” 
subpopulations [Rogers et al., 2012]. If this theory is correct, it follows that attenuation by inhaled 
antimicrobials might be a feature in common to different pharmacological classes. 
As only three inhaled antimicrobials are currently approved in the EU in the claimed indication, there is a need 
for additional options, preferably from another pharmacological class: to treat patients who no longer respond 
to or who are intolerant of the other antimicrobials, to reduce cumulative exposure to any single class and thus 
reduce the risk of chronic toxicities associated with the class, and to allow for cycling of drug classes or other 
regimens in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness of the therapeutic strategy and perhaps reduce the 
emergence of antimicrobial ineffectiveness [VanDevanter et al., 2011].  
The fluoroquinolone class, owing to its topical potency and broad spectrum of bactericidal activity, is particularly 
promising in this regard. MP-376 is intended to be the first inhaled form of a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) for 
use in chronic maintenance therapy. MP-376 aims to address an unmet medical need and has the potential to 
provide a significant addition to the aerosol antimicrobial armamentarium in CF, as evidenced by its 
effectiveness in treating chronic P. aeruginosa infection safely in patients with CF.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Levofloxacin - Aptalis 240 mg Nebulizer Solution (MP-376) is a new inhaled formulation of levofloxacin for the 
management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
(CF). MP-376 is intended to be the first inhaled form of fluoroquinolone for use in chronic maintenance therapy 
in CF. 
The systemic form of levofloxacin has been marketed as Tavanic® in the European Union (EU) since 1997 and 
as Levaquin in the United States (US) since 1996. The approved indications for oral and intravenous (IV) 
formulations of Tavanic in the EU include community-acquired pneumonia. Levaquin is also approved in the US 
for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa. MP-376 is not approved for use in any country; 
it is undergoing development both in the EU and USA with the aim of seeking approval in these and other 
territories (e.g. Canada).  
MP-376 formulation development aimed to minimise the bitter taste of levofloxacin while optimising drug 
product attributes (pH, osmolality, chloride concentration and drug concentration) to enable efficient nebulizer 
performance (aerosol particle size, breathing pattern, and airway geometry) with acceptable drug product 
stability. 
Three formulations of MP-376 were studied clinically (MP-376-001 at 30 mg/mL levofloxacin, MP-376-002 at 
50 mg/mL and MP-376-003 at 100 mg/mL). Initial formulation development focused on levofloxacin 
concentrations of 30 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL and magnesium chloride was added to improve aqueous solubility 
and improve the bitter taste. Lactose was added to further improve taste. In order to maintain the osmolality at 
< 500 mOsm/kg, formulations of levofloxacin above 50 mg/mL were prepared without lactose. The 100 mg/mL 
levofloxacin concentration was chosen for Phase 2 and 3 studies and this is the formulation intended for the 
market.  
Levofloxacin-Aptalis (MP-376) is to be presented for clinical use as a liquid in ampoules containing 240 mg 
levofloxacin. Each millilitre of the MP-376 240 mg Nebulizer Solution contains levofloxacin hemihydrate (102.50 
mg), magnesium chloride (40.66 mg) and water for injection (qs to make 1.0 mL). It is administered using a 
medical device based on the PARI eFlow® Nebulizer System, consisting of a handset configured specifically for 
use with MP-376 and a control unit. This is referred to as the MP-376-customized PARI eFlow nebulizer in the 
application dossier.  
The revised proposed indication for use is: 
Quinsair is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, see section 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
2.2.   Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

Other ingredients are: magnesium chloride hexahydrate and water for injection as described in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
The product is available in strips of 4 LDPE ampoules sealed in a sachet as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
Quinsair is administered by inhalation using a Quinsair specific Zirela Nebuliser Handset and Zirela Aerosol Head 
connected to an eBase Controller or an eFlow rapid Control Unit as described in sections 6.6  and 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance levofloxacin hemihydrate is (-)-(S)-9-fluoro-2-3-dihydro-3-methyl- 
-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate 
corresponding to the molecular formula C18H20FN3O4 . 1/2 H2O and has a relative molecular mass 370.37. It has 
the following structure: 
The  structure  of  the  active  substance  has  been  confirmed  by  mass  spectrometry,  FT-IR,  1H-  and  13C-NMR 
spectroscopy and elemental analysis, all of which support the chemical structure. 
Levofloxacin hemihydrate appears as a pale or bright yellow, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder.  
The solubility of levofloxacin hemihydrate in water is pH dependent. Between pH 0.56-5.84, the solubility profile 
is flat (73-108 mg/ml). The solubility increases with further increases in pH to a maximum of 272 mg/ml at pH 
6.74 and a minimum pH solubility profile at pH 7-8. 
Levofloxacin contains one chiral carbon and is the levorotatory isomer of the D, L Ofloxacin. The absence of 
racemization was confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis of the degradated levofloxacin. It has been shown that the 
chiral purity of levofloxacin remains unchanged in the proposed storage conditions.  
The hemihydrate form of levofloxacin is controlled by water determination (KF titration), which is performed 
routinely  on  every  batch.  The  substance  shows  polymorphism.  The  polymorphic  structure  is  satisfactorily 
controlled by XRD in final substance specification. Three polymorphic forms (α, β, γ), two pseudopolymorphic 
forms (hemihydrate and monohydrate) and six solvate forms (A, B, C, F, G and H) of levofloxacin are described 
in the literature. The hemihydrate form is consistently obtained by the process parameters and solvents system. 
The monohydrate form is not found as impurity in levofloxacin hemihydrate form. Moreover, the hemihydrate is 
stable  crystal  form  and  has  been  shown  not  to  convert  to  the  monohydrate  neither  during  storage  nor  by 
exposure to humidity. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  material  which  complies  with  the  EC  Directives  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The information on the active substance was provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The active substance is manufactured in four steps including purification. No reworking is performed. The 
starting materials are acceptable and well defined. Satisfactory acceptance specifications and analytical 
methods have been provided for starting materials, reagents and solvents. The intermediates have been also 
designated and their specifications and analytical methods are accepted. There are no critical steps in the 
process. As the substance is not intended as sterile, no process validation is required to be submitted prior to 
authorisation of the product. 
The reagent (S)-amino-propanol, which determines the enantiomeric purity of the finished substance, is 
satisfactorily controlled for specific rotation with acceptably narrow limit. 
Sufficient information about any potential genotoxic impurities (GTIs) has been presented. During the synthesis 
of starting material N-methyl piperazine formaldehyde is used, which is potentially genotoxic. The residual 
content is controlled in the final substance and the proposed limit has been satisfactorily discussed. The overall 
control strategy for any GTIs is considered satisfactory.  
The absence of metal catalysts in the starting material, intermediate or final substance was demonstrated. 
The synthesis has been described in sufficient detail and critical process parameters and in-process controls 
(IPCs) have been reported and are considered satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on the 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities and degradation products have been 
characterised and toxicologically qualified as appropriate.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for: appearance (visual), identity (IR, 
HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), formaldehyde (HPLC), 
sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), water (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GS) and bioburden 
(aerobic count: Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification and justification is generally adequate to control the active substance. The limits 
proposed for impurities control are in agreement with guideline ICH Q3A with the exception of Impurity DesMe 
LVF, which is a human metabolite. Therefore, despite it is controlled to a limit greater than the qualification 
threshold, this poses no concern. Reference is made to the Non-clinical assessment report for further details.  
Residual formaldehyde is controlled at a limit higher than the TTC (Guideline on the limits of genotoxic 
impurities, CPMP/SWP/5199/02), which, however, has been toxicologically justified. Reference is made to the 
Non-clinical assessment report for further details. The limit proposed for enantiomeric impurity D-Ofloxacin is 
supported by batch data. Taking also into account that the racemate compound -ofloxacin- is an authorised 
active substance the limit is considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data for 3 commercial scale batches manufactured using the proposed commercial process have 
been provided. The batch analytical results indicate that the drug substance routinely complies with the 
proposed specification. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 14/106 
 
  
  
  
Stability 
Stability data on 24 commercial size batches of active substance stored in closure system representative of the 
commercial one for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 25 °C/ 60 % RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Stability data on three commercial size batches for up to six months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 °C/ 75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The results have shown the 
substance to be stable in the proposed packaging. 
The methods used are the same as those used for release and are considered stability indicating. 
No trends have been identified during stability. The stability results provided are in compliance with the 
proposed specification. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a nebuliser solution of levofloxacin in an 
aqueous based formulation.  
The formulation development focused on minimisation of the bitter taste of levofloxacin, optimisation of product 
attributes (pH, osmolality, chloride concentration, and antibiotic concentration) to enable efficient nebuliser 
performance (aerosol particle size, breathing pattern and airway geometry) and acceptable product stability. 
Solubility of levofloxacin in water is considered to be of importance in the development of this formulation. 
Levofloxacin can be considered as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class 1 (high solubility, high 
permeability) compound. The solubility of levofloxacin hemihydrate in water is pH dependent. 
Levofloxacin has a bitter and metallic taste requiring taste masking. The use of magnesium chloride 
hexahydrate resulted in a significant masking of levofloxacin undesired taste. Magnesium forms complexes with 
levofloxacin which results in a significant masking of levofloxacin bitterness and metallic taste. It has also been 
demonstrated that it increases the solubility of the active substance. 
Magnesium chloride hexahydrate has not been used in inhalation products in the EU. A review of its use as an 
excipient, particularly as an excipient in inhalation products, was conducted and the pharmacology/clinical use 
and toxicology of magnesium salts was assessed in order to investigate the safe use of this excipient in Quinsair 
nebuliser solution.  However, as no clinical or non-clinical concerns have been raised regarding the use of this 
excipient for inhalation use and as MgCl2.6H2O, is a well-known excipient in pharmaceutical products, described 
in worldwide compendia, from a quality point of view, it has been accepted  not to be considered as a novel 
excipient.  
Water for injection is the only other excipient used in the formulation.  Both Magnesium chloride hexahydrate 
and Water for injection comply with their respective Ph. Eur. monographs. 
During early Phase 1 clinical trials lactose was also used as a flavouring agent in addition to magnesium. Clinical 
investigations using higher levofloxacin concentrations were undertaken in order to make levofloxacin 
administration more efficient with shorter dose administration times. In order to maintain the osmolality of 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 15/106 
 
  
  
  
formulations with higher levofloxacin concentration lactose was removed. The nebuliser solution concentration 
was increased to 100 mg/ml levofloxacin. 
The physical parameters of the nebuliser solution considered to influence the aerosol deposition of the drug 
include pH, osmolality, chloride concentration and antibiotic concentration. These physical characteristics have 
been studied as they relate to airway tolerance and efficient nebulisation and the proposed target values or 
ranges have been sufficiently justified.  
The product is packaged in clear LDPE ampoules; a strip of 4 ampoules is sealed in a sachet intended to provide 
protection from light and environmental agents. Satisfactory extractables and leachables studies were 
conducted on the container closure system and labelling and packaging materials. 
Quinsair nebuliser solution is administered using a CE marked medical device - Zirela® - which is based on the 
PARI eFlow® Rapid Nebulizer System. It is consisted of a handset configured specifically for use with Quinsair 
nebuliser solution and a Zirela Aerosol Head connected to a control unit (eBase Controller or an eFlow rapid 
nebuliser system) as per SmPC 6.6.  
The physicochemical parameters influencing the deposition of aerosols in the lungs, i.e. particle or droplet size, 
have been studied as per the Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products” 
(QWP/49313/2005). Results showed that the aerodynamic droplet size distribution characteristics and the 
device performance remained practically unchanged following 60 nebulisation cycles and using the three 
different device configurations. Aerodynamic particle size distribution determination studies was done 
simulating the normal use of the nebuliser with nebulisation, cleaning and sanitising procedures applied 
according to the instruction for use of the Zirela® Nebulizer System. It was confirmed that the aerosol 
characteristics (MMD, GSD, RF and TOR) were robust over the duration of the experiments. 
The Drug Delivery Rate (DDR) and the Total Drug Delivered (TDD) as well as the delivered dose variability was 
studied in line with Ph. Eur. requirements using adult and child breathing pattern simulating the normal use of 
the nebuliser. In addition the reproducibility of ten Zirela® Nebulizer Systems equipped with heads 
representative of the devices tested during the clinical development and proposed for the market was studied. 
The studies concluded that there were no differences in the delivered dose, the drug remaining in the device and 
drug delivery rate for the two different batches of Quinsair studied.  It was also shown that all analysed 
parameters for the child pattern experiments are in the expected range. Delivered dose for child pattern is little 
higher in comparison to delivered dose results of breath simulation experiments with adult pattern. Nebulisation 
time, residual amount of formulation and drug delivery rate are similar to the adult pattern breath simulation 
experiments. 
Furthermore breath simulation experiments, using 4 different holding angles, and ten different Zirela® Nebulizer 
Systems representative of the devices tested during the clinical development and proposed for the market were 
conducted. It was shown that the delivered dose and the residual amount of nebuliser solution in the device are 
affected by the holding angle. Therefore appropriate recommendation is included in the product information (6.6 
of SmPC and PL). 
A study on three batches tested before and after the nebulisation runs for assay, related substances osmolality 
and pH indicated that there are no concerns on the activity of the active substance following nebulisation thus 
demonstrating that the activity of the levofloxacin is not affected by the nebulisation process.  
The manufacturing process employs aseptic filtration dictated by the type of ampoules (LDPE) used as primary 
packaging. The specific type of ampules technology offers the advantage of larger batch sizes than using glass

vials and also avoiding the possible breakage of glass vials during manufacturing and most importantly during 
use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The product is manufactured by dissolving the active substance and magnesium chloride hexahydrate in water 
for injection. The solution is then filtered through two filters 0.22 μm and filled under aseptic conditions into 
LDPE ampoules, using Blow Fill Seal (BFS) technology. The manufacturing process which is a non-standard 
process has been described appropriately and is consistent with other blow/fill/seal nebuliser products. Bulk 
solution is controlled as intermediate product by appropriate specifications; bioburden is controlled in the bulk 
solution. Sufficient in process controls are in place. 
Process validation data on three consecutive validation batches manufactured at the intended full production 
scale were presented. Filter integrity has been proven and fill volume has been justified. Further validation 
results for the preparation of bulk solution, validation of sterilising filters, validation of fill volume, media fill test, 
sterility validation of the ampules, mould qualification and validation of ampoule leak test have been provided. 
Overall it is considered that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to provide assurance that the process 
produces the finished product Quinsair nebuliser solution of consistent quality, complying with the specification. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for appearance 
(visual), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur. - at release only),  identification (UV, HPLC - at 
release only), related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.- at 
release only),  magnesium (AAS- at release only), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), container and seal integrity 
(visual), weight loss (end of shelf life) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
Sufficient justification and experimental data on physicochemical properties characterisation, which influence 
aerosol deposition, patient tolerability and compliance, aerodynamic assessment using the proposed device was 
provided. In addition considering also the overall validation activities, the controls in place are considered 
sufficient and therefore routine determination of aerodynamic properties is not required to be included in the 
routine specifications.  
It has been justified, based on stability results, that the chiral purity of levofloxacin remained unchanged at the 
storage conditions thus it is acceptable not to include it in the shelf life specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data in line with parameters in release specification on four production scale and three clinical 
batches were provided. The results comply with the specification and are consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of four production scale batches stored under long term conditions for up to 36 months at 25 °C/ 
60 % RH  and 25 °C/ 40 % RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions 40 °C/75 % RH and 40 °C/25 
% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition results on two pilot batches under the same 
storage conditions (25 °C/ 40 % RH and 40 °C/25 % RH) were also provided. The stability batches were 
packaged in packaging configurations including the intended for marketing and others considered as worst case 
scenario. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 17/106 
 
  
  
  
The samples were tested as per the shelf life specifications and the methods have been shown to be stability 
indicating. Results on all tested parameters were within the specifications. In addition, a statistical evaluation 
was performed to compare the assay stability data generated on all batches at 25 °C at different RH conditions 
(40% and 60%) in accordance with  ICH Q1E. It has been shown that regardless of the different relative 
humidity storage conditions in different batches the assay trend is comparable. 
In-use studies have been carried out on one batch of drug product. The parameters tested were appearance, pH, 
assay, related substances and particulate matter and all met the acceptance criteria set. 
Freeze/thaw studies have also been carried out on one batch of drug product The parameters tested were 
appearance, pH, assay, related substances and particulate matter and all parameters met the acceptance 
criteria set. 
A photostability study for one batch of product under ICH conditions was conducted. The provided results 
showed that when the ampoules are removed from the sachets degradation occurs but confirmed that the 
proposed packaging is suitable for the product. 
Based on the presented stability data and statistical analyses the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC are supported.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The physicochemical properties of the active substance have been considered during 
formulation development. The excipients used in the formulation are well known and their function and choice 
have been adequately justified. The description of medical device, its components and its way of working has 
been provided. It has been shown that the physicochemical parameters influencing the deposition of the aerosol 
in the lungs, simulating normal conditions of use, remain practically unchanged. The conducted studies comply 
with the Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products (QWP/49313/2005). Droplet 
Size Distribution has been measured according to Ph. Eur. 2.9.28, Apparatus E – Next Generation Impactor 
(NGI) or validated laser diffraction data and Drug Delivery Rate (DDR) and the Total Drug Delivered (TDD) has 
been measured by breath simulation testing (adult and children breathing pattern) according to Ph. Eur. 2.9.44. 
The presented information confirms that the controls in place are considered sufficient with regard to the 
performance of the device. The finished product manufacturing process has been described in adequate detail 
and the proposed sterilisation method has been justified. The process is considered non-standard and has been 
properly validated. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical development programme for MP-376 was conducted using the inhalation route; these include two 
in vitro and four in vivo primary pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, two in vivo secondary PD studies, two in vivo 
safety  pharmacology  studies  conducted  in  accordance  with  GLP,  four  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies,  one 
single-dose toxicity study and eight repeat-dose toxicity studies (GLP and non-GLP).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary/secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
The antibacterial spectrum of levofloxacin is well established. Nonclinical studies specifically relevant to the 
treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections in patients with CF were conducted. Several in-vitro and in-vivo 
pharmacodynamic studies investigated the actions of levofloxacin, formulated as either MP-376 or as a solution 
in saline, against strains of P. aeruginosa. In-vivo studies utilized intra-tracheal instillation or a microspray 
aerosol device; in both methods levofloxacin was administered at the bifurcation of the trachea which provided 
100% delivery to the lungs. These studies are reported as either in-house reports or in publications in the 
scientific literature. The studies included investigation of the effects of levofloxacin against strains of P. 
aeruginosa that display resistance by different mechanisms. 
The present inhalation formulation contains MgCl2 6H2O. In the published literature there have been reports that 
magnesium-supplemented media are associated with a small reduction in in-vitro potency of some 
fluoroquinolones but in-vitro comparisons of levofloxacin formulated in saline or as MP-376 showed similar 
activity with MIC values of 1 µg/mL and 8 µg/mL against P. aeruginosa strains PAM 1032 and PAM 1481, 
respectively, when tested in Mueller-Hinton broth. 
Levofloxacin formulated in saline or as MP-376, at concentrations that are substantially higher than can be 
administered systemically, was rapidly bactericidal against P. aeruginosa. In-vitro studies evaluating the 
antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa CF isolates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 
have been reported in the literature; in some studies ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, amikacin and/or aztreonam 
were used as comparators. Levofloxacin was found to be more bactericidal compared to other fluoroquinolones 
against P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients and anaerobic conditions did not affect the efficacy. 
The extent of bacterial killing of resistant strains of P. aeruginosa in single and repeated dose models was 
greater with inhalation (aerosol) administration than with intra-peritoneal (IP) administration.  In addition, 
inhalation (aerosol) doses of MP-376 had better activity than levofloxacin in saline against resistant strains of 
P. aeruginosa. Inhalation (aerosol) of MP-376 also produced bacterial killing against B. cepacia in a repeated 
dose mouse pneumonia model. 
Studies evaluating the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in various mouse models of 
infection (lung, thigh and systemic) using inhalation (aerosol), IP and subcutaneous (SC) routes of 
administration have been reported in the literature. In some studies aztreonam and tobramycin were used as 
comparators. Levofloxacin was equally or more active than aztreonam and tobramycin against several strains of 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 19/106 
 
  
  
  
P. aeruginosa after inhalation (aerosol) in mice. In a mouse thigh infection model due to P. aeruginosa, the 
relationship between levofloxacin drug exposure and reduction in bacterial load was inoculum dependent and 
optimal drug exposure was necessary to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. 
Isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa were tested with levofloxacin with and without efflux pump inhibitors in mouse 
sepsis and neutropenic mouse thigh infection models. The results showed that although the MexEF-OprN efflux 
pump can provide P. aeruginosa resistance to levofloxacin in vitro, it appears less efficient in providing 
resistance to levofloxacin in animal models of infection. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Since the intended route of administration of MP-376 is inhalation, GLP-compliant inhalation respiratory safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted with levofloxacin formulated in 0.9% saline (rats) and as MP-376 (dogs). 
There were no treatment-related effects on respiratory function (respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute 
volume) at estimated presented doses up to 288 mg/kg (high-dose females; equivalent to pulmonary deposited 
dose of 28.8 mg/kg) of levofloxacin in rats and no treatment-related effects at presented doses up to 99 mg/kg 
of MP-376 (high-dose; pulmonary deposited dose of 24.6 mg/kg) in dogs. 
In the 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in dogs, no cardiovascular effects (as measured by ECG) or 
respiratory effects (respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute volume) were observed at presented doses up to 
69 mg/kg/day (high-dose; pulmonary deposited doses of 17.3 mg/kg/day). No treatment-related overt signs 
indicative of CNS effects or treatment-related effects on urinalysis were observed in rats and dogs dosed with 
MP-376 for up to 6 months and 28 days, respectively. 
The safety pharmacology of levofloxacin has been evaluated in vitro (effects on smooth muscle) and in vivo 
(effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous, autonomic nervous, gastrointestinal (GI) and renal 
systems and other pharmacological effects). 
Slight muscle effects were observed in isolated trachea from guinea pigs, ileum from guinea pigs and uteri from 
rats. No treatment-related changes in the respiratory system were observed. Levofloxacin produced a 
hypotensive and bradycardic effect after rapid IV administration in anesthetized dogs accompanied by an 
increase in plasma histamine concentration. These effects were markedly reduced when levofloxacin was 
administered by continuous IV infusion.  
Levofloxacin had an interaction with the hERG channel with an IC50 of 915 μM (340 µg/mL). The recommended 
dosing regimen for MP-376 of 240 mg BID gives a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) value of 3.4 µg/mL at 
steady state. Therefore this finding is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Studies in rabbit Purkinje fibres and 
in guinea pig right ventricular myocardium revealed no detectable effect on action potential duration with 
levofloxacin at concentrations up to 100 μM (37 µg/mL). 
In rabbits following IV administration of levofloxacin, no prolongations of the QT interval or arrhythmias were 
observed. The potential for levofloxacin to induce torsades de pointes was examined in a canine model of 
chronic high-degree atrioventricular block and oral administration of levofloxacin at 6 and 60 mg/kg did not 
induce any ventricular arrhythmias. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted by Aptalis and no studies specifically 
relevant to the inhalation (aerosol) administration of levofloxacin have been identified in the literature. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 20/106 
 
  
  
  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the rat, three single-dose PK inhalation studies and 3 repeated-dose inhalation toxicokinetics studies were 
conducted. Toxicokinetic parameters were determined in the MP-376 studies on Day 1 (7-day study), Days 1 
and 28 (28-day study) and on Day 1 and Weeks 13 and 26 (6-month study). In the 28-day inhalation study 
using levofloxacin in saline, plasma levofloxacin levels were determined but TK parameters were not calculated. 
Inhalation (aerosol) dosing of levofloxacin in saline or as MP-376 resulted in rapid absorption in plasma with 
nearly complete systemic bioavailability (levofloxacin was administered at the bifurcation of the trachea which 
was shown to provide 100% delivery to the lungs).  Plasma levofloxacin concentrations for the inhalation 
(aerosol) dose were found to be virtually identical to those after the IV dose.  Although levofloxacin plasma 
concentrations and AUC were similar between levofloxacin in saline and MP-376, the rate of levofloxacin 
absorption in plasma was slightly slower when administered as MP-376.  
Nose-only exposure to aerosols at target doses of 60 and 240 mg/kg of levofloxacin resulted in a dose-related 
increase in both lung concentration and systemic exposure of levofloxacin. 
Dose response data for MP-376 after a single administration on day 1 of a 7-day study revealed a dose-related 
but non-linear increase in systemic exposure in the rat (and also the dog).  
Toxicokinetic analyses were performed in repeated-dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats conducted with 
levofloxacin in saline at target doses of 11 to 54 mg/kg/day for 28 days and MP-376 at target doses of 38 to 
200 mg/kg/day for up to 6 months. Maximum plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were achieved immediately 
after exposure. Levofloxacin exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in a dose proportional manner in the 6-month 
MP-376 repeated-dose toxicology study but in a less than dose proportional manner in 28-day repeat-dose 
toxicology studies with levofloxacin in saline and MP-376. Levofloxacin exposure also tended to increase with 
repeated dosing in rats and was consistently higher in females (6-month repeat-dose study only). Comparable 
levofloxacin exposure was observed between Week 13 and Week 26, indicating that it was approaching steady 
state by Week 13.   
The non-linear kinetics in the rat and dog following a single inhalational administration and the increase in 
systemic exposure upon repeated dosing in the rat were attributed to various technical difficulties.  Cmax and AUC 
parameters of levofloxacin increased with increasing dose in both rat and dog. The less than dose-proportional 
increase in exposure in the rat may be at least partly due to the varied duration of exposure of different doses 
and the limitation of TK sampling, i.e. the collection of TK samples only post-inhalation.  In the dog, where 
duration of exposure was fixed, a slightly more than dose proportional increase in exposure was generally seen. 
In both rat and dog, the small sample sizes limited sampling times and large inter-animal variability might have 
also contributed to these outcomes. Therefore, nonlinear kinetics cannot be concluded with certainty from these 
studies. The objective of repeat-dose inhalation toxicity studies was to evaluate the local toxicity on MP-376 on 
the respiratory tract rather than the pharmacokinetics per se. The inconsistency of the conducted PK/TK 
nonclinical studies precludes the extrapolation with clinical relevance. However, pharmacokinetic data from 
clinical studies supersedes the discrepancies observed in preclinical studies. 
Toxicokinetic data from 7-day range finding repeated-dose studies in rats and dogs showed dose-related, but 
non-linear, increases in systemic exposure and also similar exposures in male and female animals at a given 
dose, except for high-dose dogs where females had higher plasma levels. Although the body weights were lower 
in females compared to corresponding males, bodyweight did not appear to be related to the higher exposure. 
The reason for the higher exposure in females is not known. This may reflect inter-animal variability 
compounded by the small sample size (2/sex/dose). 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 21/106 
 
  
  
  
In the dog, one single-dose PK study and 2 repeat-dose TK studies (TK on Day 1 in the 7-day study and TK on 
Days 1 and 28 in the 28-day study) were conducted. Following a single-dose in dogs, plasma levofloxacin AUCs 
increased with increasing inhalation (aerosol) dose when administered as MP-376. The plasma levofloxacin AUC 
of the 20 mg/kg target daily inhalation (aerosol) dose (presented dose of 32 mg/kg/day, 8.0 mg/kg pulmonary 
deposited dose assuming 25% pulmonary deposition of the dose) was approximately 1.5-fold greater than the 
AUC observed after a 7.5 mg/kg IV dose of levofloxacin in male and female dogs, suggesting that the overall 
systemic exposure following an inhalation (aerosol) dose is greater than 25% or reflects both lung and oral 
absorption of the nebulized levofloxacin. 
In the 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in the dog, increases in levofloxacin exposure (Cmax and AUC) were 
proportional to dose over the dose range of 20 to 60 mg/kg/day after single- and repeat-doses. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were achieved 4 hours after inhalation exposure and were higher than 
achieved with rats across a similar dose range. There was no accumulation of levofloxacin with repeat-doses of 
MP-376 in dogs nor did there appear to be a gender effect on levofloxacin exposure in dogs. 
The absorption of levofloxacin was investigated after oral administration (single and repeat-dose) to mice, rats 
(non-pregnant, pregnant and lactating), dogs and monkeys and after IV administration (single and repeat-dose) 
to rats, dogs and monkeys. In all species, levofloxacin was absorbed rapidly after single and repeat oral dose 
administrations and systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC values) increased in a dose related manner in all 
species. 
When mice were administered a single inhalation (aerosol) dose of MP-376 at 60 mg/kg or an IP dose of 
levofloxacin in saline at 20 mg/kg,  MP-376 produced levofloxacin Cmax and AUC values in  levofloxacin lung 
homogenate concentrations that were 30- and 9-fold higher respectively than that achieved by the 
dose-normalized IP administration. 
Concentrations of levofloxacin in rat lung tissue, BAL and ELF were determined at 0.5, 1.5 and 3 hours post-dose 
following a single inhalation (aerosol) or IV dose of levofloxacin in saline. Levofloxacin concentrations in ELF 
were higher with inhalation (aerosol) dosing compared to IV dosing. Following MP-376 administration, 
absorption was slower and BAL concentrations were higher as compared to an inhalation (aerosol) dose of 
levofloxacin in saline. In rats 2 hours after exposure to aerosols at target doses of 60 and 240 mg/kg of 
levofloxacin, the levofloxacin concentrations in lung homogenates were higher in females than in males. In rats, 
inhalation resulted in higher BAL fluid and lung levels of levofloxacin than those reached after IV administration.  
In study IITRI 2131-001 SN2, a 28-day nose-only inhalation study in rat, levofloxacin was detected in 50% 
(6/12) of urine samples in the vehicle group. According to the Applicant the source of the levofloxacin in the 
urine samples could not be identified but could possibly be due to low level contamination during sample 
collection and/or sample processing. The levels of levofloxacin quantified in the vehicle group animal on Day 28 
at the 2-hour time point are lower than the levels quantified in the low dose group on Day 28 at the 2-hour time 
point (male group urine ~ 20-fold lower and female group urine ~ 65-fold lower) the levofloxacin in the vehicle 
group would not be expected to have any impact on the overall outcome and interpretation of the study.  
In normal animals (mice and rats) brain levels of [14C]-levofloxacin related radioactivity were low suggesting 
poor passage across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Penetration of the BBB may have been limited due to 
restriction by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transport. However levofloxacin was shown to penetrate into 
cerebrospinal fluid in a rabbit model of bacterial meningitis. It is possible that the BBB is less effective under the 
inflammatory conditions inherent in this infection model. 
Levofloxacin is a substrate for P-gp efflux transport and, although affinity to P-gp is low, this may contribute to 
the restricted distribution in the brain and the occurrence of renal tubular secretion of levofloxacin. Levofloxacin 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 22/106 
 
  
  
  
has an affinity for melanin and binds to melanin-containing ocular tissue when administered to pigmented rats, 
but binding is reversible.   
After repeated oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days to rats, the potential for levofloxacin 
accumulation was observed in some tissues (heart, spleen, prostate, thymus and salivary gland).  Although the 
levofloxacin high-dose levels in the 28-day and 6-month MP-376 rat studies achieved a 20 mg/kg/day 
pulmonary deposited dose, no systemic organ toxicity was observed indicating that if tissue accumulation 
occurred it was in the absence of histopathological findings. 
In pregnant rats, following oral administration of radiolabeled levofloxacin, extensive distribution occurred 
throughout the maternal tissues and the placenta, with small amounts associated with the fetus.  Radioactivity 
levels declined rapidly indicating a low potential for accumulation.  
Protein binding in rats measured ex vivo after oral and IV levofloxacin administration ranged from 16-73%.  In 
vitro, over a clinically relevant range of concentrations (1 to 10 μg/mL), levofloxacin was approximately 24 to 
38% bound to serum proteins across all species studied (species studied not specified), except in monkey 
plasma which showed low binding at the same concentration levels (9 to 14%).   
The metabolism of levofloxacin was evaluated after oral dosing in rats, dogs and monkeys.  Three minor 
metabolites were identified in the urine, faeces and/or plasma and were designated as M1 (acyl glucuronide), M2 
(N-desmethyl-levofloxacin) and M3 (levofloxacin N-oxide) with unchanged levofloxacin being the major 
component in urine (58-65%) and the metabolites accounting for less than 5% of the dose in the urine.  These 
metabolites were formed by glucuronide conjugation N-demethylation, and N-oxidation of levofloxacin, 
respectively, and were reported to have little relevant pharmacological activity. Levofloxacin undergoes limited 
metabolism.  
In rats, similar concentrations of levofloxacin were found in the urine and faeces, or a majority in the faeces; 
however, the urinary route was the major route of excretion in dogs and monkeys. In humans, levofloxacin is 
excreted largely as unchanged drug in the urine, similar to dogs and monkeys. Secretion of levofloxacin was also 
observed in the milk of lactating rats after oral dosing.  
In the rat, the elimination half-life of 9.8 and 16.7 h in males and females, respectively, seems high in 4 week 
study (HLS-06-6285) as in the study with the same pulmonary dose of 20 mg/kg and the same 240 minute 
exposure was t 1/2 2-3 hours for both genders. The Applicant argues that difference in t 1/2 values in studies in 
question (HLS-06-6285, HLS-06-6321) was due to the duration of the sampling (21 vs 8 hours). In order to 
compare the t½ based on the same PK sampling duration, the parameter was re-estimated for Study 
HLS-06-6285 assuming that the last PK sample was drawn at 8 hours post-dose. The results have shown similar 
t 1/2 values (3-4 hours) to those from the 6- month toxicity study (HLS-07-6321).  
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with levofloxacin in saline or MP-376. The 
cytochrome P450 system is not involved in the metabolism of levofloxacin and nor is it affected by levofloxacin. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The inhalational single dose toxicity of MP-376 was investigated in anesthetized rats using a microspray aerosol 
device which delivers 100% of the dose at the bifurcation of the trachea following natural respirations. The 
pulmonary deposited doses were approximately 27, 37, and 65 mg/kg.  There were no deaths but decreased 
physical activity and ptosis or piloerection occurred at 37 and 65 mg/kg.

The repeated-dose toxicity of MP-376 was evaluated using inhalation administration in rats and dogs for up to 
6 months and 28 days, respectively.  The NOAELs in the longest-duration repeat-dose inhalation studies were 
target daily doses of 200 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study in rats and 50 mg/kg/day in the 7-day study in dogs, 
corresponding to achieved daily doses of 195 and 43 mg/kg/day, respectively.   
In the rat, decreases in neutrophils occurred in the inhalation 7-day, 28-day and the 6-month studies at target 
daily doses ranging from 11 to 200 mg/kg/day and from 11 to 150 mg/kg/day in females and males respectively. 
In the definitive 28-day and 6-month studies, the decreases in neutrophils were observed only in females.  
Decreased monocytes also occurred in the 28-day study in both sexes (target doses of 11 and 54 mg/kg/day) 
and 6-month study in females at all dose levels (target doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day).  In the 6-month 
study, neutrophil counts in females were comparable to controls after a 1-month recovery period.  In the 28-day 
preliminary study (levofloxacin in saline), neutrophils were still decreased 44% compared to controls after a 
4-week recovery period, but this finding was not statistically significant.   
In previously conducted oral dose studies with levofloxacin in rats in 28-day, 26-week and 105-week 
(carcinogenicity) repeated-dose studies, decreased neutrophil counts were observed at all dose levels (20 to 
800 mg/kg/day) compared to vehicle controls. 
In the rat, reductions in absolute lung weight in males occurred at target doses of 11 and 32 mg/kg/day, 
and decreased relative lung weights in the male recovery group (target dose of 54 mg/kg/day) occurred in the 
28-day preliminary inhalation study (levofloxacin in saline); however, this did not occur in the definitive 28-day 
and 6-month inhalation toxicity studies of MP-376.   
In the rat, significant histopathological findings in the inhalation toxicity studies were squamous 
hyperplasia/metaplasia of the larynx in the 7- and 28-day studies and the 6-month study.  In the preliminary 
28-day study of levofloxacin in saline, squamous hyperplasia/metaplasia was noted in all dose groups (target 
doses of 11, 32 and 54 mg/kg/day).  Keratinization was also noted in the larynx at the target dose of 54 
mg/kg/day.  In the definitive 28-day study of MP-376, minimal to slight squamous metaplasia of the cuboidal 
and columnar epithelium was noted in the vehicle control and high-dose group (target dose of 150 mg/kg/day).  
Also in this study, goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium was present in all groups in the nasal 
turbinates with increased incidence and severity in the vehicle control group.  In the 6-month rat study, 
squamous/squamoid metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the base of the epiglottis was present in all 
groups exposed to MP-376 with a dose-related severity (target doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day; minimal 
to moderate).  Minimal hyperkeratosis of the larynx occurred at 200 mg/kg/day in 2 males and 2 females.   
The histopathological lesions in the larynx of rats were decreased in severity after a 2-week recovery in the 
preliminary 28-day study of levofloxacin in saline.  After a 4-week recovery period in the definitive 28-day study 
of MP-376, histopathological changes in the larynx and nasal turbinates had resolved in most animals.  A single 
male from the vehicle control group still had moderate goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the 
nasal turbinates.  In the 6-month study of MP-376, squamous/squamoid metaplasia of the respiratory 
epithelium of the base of the epiglottis was still present in the larynx of 2/5 males at 100 mg/kg/day and 
200 mg/kg/day after the 4-week recovery period; however, the severity of the observed lesions was reduced 
compared with the end of the dosing period. 
The squamous/squamoid metaplasia of the larynx and degeneration/atrophy of the nasal olfactory epithelium 
seen in rodents after nose-only exposure occurred with greater frequency in animals exposed for longer 
durations of time and were even observed in the vehicle control group in the 28-day study (MgCl2 6H2O and 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 24/106 
 
  
  
  
 
lactose), which was administered over a 4-hour period.  The changes to the larynx and nasal olfactory 
epithelium were either partially or totally resolved during the 4-week recovery periods in both studies.   
Squamous cell metaplasia has been noted following inhalational exposure to a variety of substances, and has 
been concluded to be an adaptive response (i.e., replacement of a more sensitive cell type [ciliated epithelium] 
with a more resistant type). These changes are frequently noted in rodents receiving nose-only administration, 
and arise from particles impacting laryngeal tissues. Consequently, the changes to the larynx and nasal 
olfactory epithelium were considered to be an adaptive response rather than an adverse effect. They are not 
considered to be indicative of an adverse effect in humans under therapeutic conditions of use. 
Fluoroquinolones are known to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested, with dogs being 
comparatively more sensitive than other species. In previously reported studies in the rat using the oral or IV 
route of administration, a common finding was arthropathy. Dogs in the 28-day inhalation study with MP-376 
(HLS-06-6293) were approximately 7-months old at the start of dosing and showed signs of arthropathy after 
treatment. Macroscopic and microscopic treatment-related findings were observed in the tibiofemoral joint, and 
included increased synovial fluid and synovial intimal hyperplasia (both studies).  Fissures/erosions and necrosis 
in the articular cartilage and the changes were more severe in males than females.  Arthropathy with MP-376 in 
the inhalation toxicology studies occurred at systemic exposures that have been associated with arthropathy in 
previous PO and IV dog studies with levofloxacin. Changes in joints in animal studies are well recognized effects 
of levofloxacin, and of other fluoroquinolones.  
In the pivotal 28-day inhalation toxicology study of MP-376 in dogs (target daily doses of 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg), 
no treatment-related changes in ophthalmoscopy, food consumption, ECG, respiratory parameters, coagulation, 
clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weights occurred. Two males at 60 mg/kg/day were euthanized moribund 
on Day 15 as a result of toxicity (achieved pulmonary deposited doses were stated to be markedly higher than 
target pulmonary doses on Days 1 and 2).  The clinical signs in the two decedent animals included lameness, 
decreased activity, hunched posture, and weight loss.   
In the dog, effects which were attributed to histamine release were observed in the 7-day (target daily doses of 
15, 50 and 80 mg/kg/day) and 28-day (target daily doses of 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg/day) studies in dogs, 
including erythema or redness on the snout during and post-dosing at 60 to 80 mg/kg/day in several dogs.  In 
the 28-day study, this was only observed at the highest tested dose (60 mg/kg/day) on the first 2 days of 
administration except for 1 high-dose male with sporadic signs on several occasions throughout the study. 
Erythema of the inner pinna was noted in 1 male at 20 mg/kg/day on Day 11 through Day 28.  In the 7-day 
study at 80 mg/kg/day, erythema and redness were noted sporadically throughout the dosing period.   
Similar to the 6-month rat study, monocyte counts were decreased (31 to 49%) in female dogs at all dose 
groups (≥ 20 mg/kg/day) in the 28-day study.  Monocyte counts were comparable to controls after the 4-week 
recovery period. 
In the dog, minimal to moderate degeneration/atrophy of the olfactory epithelium was noted in the 7-day study 
in both sexes in the vehicle control group (MP-376 vehicle with lactose) and animals administered levofloxacin 
at target doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg/day.  The change was not present in the saline control animals or the target 
20 mg/kg/day dose group.  Focal areas of minimal to slight interstitial oedema of the nasal turbinates were also 
observed in the vehicle control and high-dose groups.  Since there was no relationship of levofloxacin dose in the 
severity of this finding, and it was absent in the saline control group, the epithelial degeneration in the test 
article-treated animals was attributed to the delivery vehicle rather than the test article.   
Macroscopic and histopathological treatment-related findings were observed in the tibiofemoral joint, and 
included increased synovial fluid and synovial intimal hyperplasia (both studies).  In the 28-day study 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 25/106 
 
  
  
  
fissures/erosions and necrosis in the articular cartilage and the changes were more severe in males than females. 
Fluoroquinolones are known to cause arthropathy in juvenile animals of most species tested, with dogs being 
relatively more sensitive than other species. 
Genotoxicity 
Levofloxacin was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay, CHO/HGRPT forward mutation assay and in vivo 
micronucleus, dominant lethal and SCE studies in mice and the UDS study in rats.  However, levofloxacin was 
found to be positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration study and SCE study in CHL cells. The probable 
mechanism of action in the positive assays was the inhibition of Topoisomerase II, resulting in the induction of 
chromosomal effects. Similar positive results in both in vivo and in vitro chromosomal aberration assays were 
also observed with another fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin.  
Carcinogenicity 
Levofloxacin was non-carcinogenic in a single 2-year oncogenicity study in rats at the highest tested dose (100 
mg/kg/day) using the oral route of administration. An additional 16-week multiple organ carcinogenicity study 
of dietary levofloxacin (0.9%) in rats was also negative for carcinogenicity. The potential carcinogenicity of 
levofloxacin has been adequately investigated. An inhalational study is not warranted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Levofloxacin has been investigated in a full package of studies reproductive toxicity studies. These studies were 
conducted to support the registration of levofloxacin for oral and intravenous use. These studies fully 
characterize the reproductive toxicity profile of levofloxacin and as effects on reproduction would be mediated 
through systemically circulating material, additional inhalation studies would not add to evaluation of any 
possible risk and thus their absence is considered justified. 
Levofloxacin caused no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in rats when administered orally or 
IV at doses up to 360 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. Levofloxacin was not teratogenic in rats at 
oral doses up to 810 mg/kg/day or at IV doses up to 160 mg/kg/day.  The oral dose of 810 mg/kg/day to rats 
caused decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality.  No teratogenicity was observed when rabbits 
were dosed orally up to 50 mg/kg/day, or when dosed IV up to 25 mg/kg/day. However, oral administration of 
levofloxacin to rabbits resulted in aborted litters in 4 females on GD 21 to GD 26. In an oral peri- and post-natal 
toxicity study in rats, there were no treatment-related effects on peri- and post-natal development at the 
highest tested dose of 360 mg/kg/day.   
Toxicokinetic data 
Comparisons of plasma exposures at the concluded NOAELs in the MP-376 repeated-dose toxicity studies with 
that in patients receiving 240 mg BID gave a safety margin in the rat of 0.3 to 1.4 and in the dog 0.9 to 1.4. 
However, it is important to emphasise that the concluded NOAELs in these studies reflect the overall profile of 
toxicity, rather than specific effects in the lung, and are primarily determined by effects on non-pulmonary sites. 
The studies in dogs, where the NOAELs were determined by effects on joints, did not show any lung-specific 
effects and those in rats are attributable to the deposition of particles within the nasal passages and larynx and 
are considered not to be relevant to humans.  
Local Tolerance  
There was evidence of phototoxicity in mice at 800 mg/kg levofloxacin (not at the lower dose of 200 mg/kg). 
Levofloxacin exhibited phototoxicity after UVA exposure similar in magnitude to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 26/106 
 
  
  
  
less than that of enoxacin and lomefloxacin. Pre-treatment with butylated hydroxytoluene, a free radical 
scavenge, almost completely prevented all swelling reactions induced by the quinolones. 
Other toxicity studies 
Serum levofloxacin concentrations following administration of MP-376 are at least two orders of magnitude less 
than those achieved in sputum.   
The principal metabolites of levofloxacin in addition to an acyl glucuronide are the N-oxide and N-desmethylated 
derivatives. The oral LD50 values in mice for the N-oxide, and N-desmethylated metabolites were >2000 mg/kg, 
with corresponding IV LD50 values of > 1000 and 44 mg/kg, respectively. N-desmethyl-levofloxacin, 
carboxy-levofloxacin and D-ofloxacin are the impurities specified in the drug substance specification. 
The impurity profile in the specification can be considered to be qualified. Single-dose toxicity studies were also 
performed on the decomposition products of levofloxacin (desfluro-levofloxacin and levofloxacin-2-Me) in mice 
after oral administration.  The LD50 values were ≥2000 mg/kg. 
Material from synthesis of levofloxacin in the current application includes formaldehyde as a potential impurity, 
with a control limit of 10 ppm. Based on a recommended daily dose of 480 mg of levofloxacin, this would result 
in maximal daily intake of 4.8 µg/day of formaldehyde. The proposed specification limit of 10 ppm (4.8 µg/day) 
in MP-376 is well below the calculated and proposed levels for occupational exposure (4- to 500-fold) and is 
therefore unlikely to pose a risk. 
The results from the inhalational studies have provided no evidence that the inhalational route of administration 
significantly alters the previously defined toxicological profile of levofloxacin arising from systemic dosing in rats 
and dogs.  Levofloxacin may elicit a weak antigenic potential in mice but had no effect in guinea pigs and rabbits.

The  Phase  I  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  in  surface  water  (PECSW)  was  calculated  using  a 
revised Fpen value based on the prevalence of CF in the EU (0.765/10,000) and using the prevalence of chronic 
PA infection in the total European Union (EU) population (0.497/10,000). The PECSW values for levofloxacin were 
0.00919 and 0.00598 μg/L, respectively. 
However, the final assessment of the ERA cannot be concluded since the logKow should be determined 
experimentally as according to the relevant guideline. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
“To conduct a study to experimentally determine the log Kow (by end 1Q2015)” 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has conducted a non-clinical development programme for MP-376 to establish the efficacy and 
safety of MP-376 using the inhalation route. The nonclinical studies utilized levofloxacin formulated in saline or 
MP-376 (levofloxacin formulated with MgCl2 6H2O and lactose in water). MgCl2 6H2O is used in the formulation 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 28/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to improve solubility via chelate formation and to improve palatability. The studies conducted by the original 
developer utilized intratracheal instillation or inhalation using a microspray aerosol device; in both methods 
levofloxacin was administered at the bifurcation of the trachea which provides 100% delivery to the lungs. In the 
studies conducted on behalf of the applicant by CROs levofloxacin was administered by inhalation to rats 
(nose-only exposure) and dogs (facemask) using compressed air clinical nebulizers. The applicant is relying on 
existing non-clinical data derived from published literature and other regulatory documents to cover other 
non-clinical aspects.  
In vivo, the extent of bacterial killing of resistant strains of P. aeruginosa in single and repeated dose models 
was greater with inhalation (aerosol) administration than with intraperitoneal (IP) administration.  In addition, 
inhalation (aerosol) doses of MP-376 had better activity than levofloxacin in saline against resistant strains of 
P. aeruginosa. Levofloxacin was equally or more active than aztreonam and tobramycin against several strains 
of P. aeruginosa after inhalation (aerosol) in mice. 
The pharmacokinetic studies revealed that inhalation (aerosol) dosing of levofloxacin in saline or as MP-376 
resulted in rapid absorption in plasma with nearly complete systemic bioavailability (levofloxacin was 
administered at the bifurcation of the trachea which was shown to provide 100% delivery to the lungs).  Plasma 
levofloxacin concentrations for the inhalation (aerosol) dose were found to be virtually identical to those after 
the IV dose.  Nose-only exposure to aerosols of levofloxacin resulted in a dose-related increase in both lung 
concentration and systemic exposure of levofloxacin.  
In the rat, inhalation resulted in higher BAL fluid and lung levels of levofloxacin than those reached after IV 
administration. In normal animals (mice and rats) brain levels of [14C]-levofloxacin related radioactivity were 
low suggesting poor passage across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Penetration of the BBB may have been 
limited due to restriction by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transport.  
The repeated-dose toxicity of MP-376 was evaluated using inhalation administration in rats and dogs for up to 
6 months and 28 days, respectively.   
In the rat, significant histopathological findings in the inhalation toxicity studies were squamous 
hyperplasia/metaplasia of the larynx in the 7- and 28-day studies and the 6-month studies. Keratinization was 
also noted in the larynx in some studies. The histopathological lesions in the larynx of rats were decreased in 
severity after a 2-week recovery in the preliminary 28-day study of levofloxacin in saline.  After a 4-week 
recovery period in the definitive 28-day study of MP-376, histopathological changes in the larynx and nasal 
turbinates had resolved in most animals. In the 6-month study of MP-376, squamous/squamoid metaplasia of 
the respiratory epithelium of the base of the epiglottis was still present in the larynx of 2/5 males at 100 
mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day after the 4-week recovery period; however, the severity of the observed lesions 
was reduced compared with the end of the dosing period. 
The squamous/squamoid metaplasia of the larynx and degeneration/atrophy of the nasal olfactory epithelium 
seen in rodents after nose-only exposure occurred with greater frequency in animals exposed for longer 
durations of time and were even observed in the vehicle control group in the 28-day study (MgCl2 6H2O and 
lactose), which was administered over a 4-hour period.  The changes to the larynx and nasal olfactory 
epithelium were either partially or totally resolved during the 4-week recovery periods in both studies.  
Squamous cell metaplasia has been noted following inhalational exposure to a variety of substances, and has 
been concluded to be an adaptive response. They are not considered to be indicative of an adverse effect in 
humans under therapeutic conditions of use.

Fluoroquinolones are known to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested, with dogs being 
comparatively more sensitive than other species. Dogs in the 28-day inhalation study with MP-376 were 
approximately 7-months old at the start of dosing and showed signs of arthropathy after treatment.  
Overall, the results from the inhalational studies have provided no evidence that the inhalational route of 
administration significantly alters the previously defined toxicological profile of levofloxacin arising from 
systemic dosing in rats and dogs.   
The final assessment of the ERA cannot be concluded since the log Kow should be determined experimentally as 
according to the relevant guideline. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the non clinical issues: 
Conduct of a study to experimentally determine the log Kow (by end 1Q2015).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Serum (not plasma) and sputum homogenate concentrations of levofloxacin were measured in all nine clinical 
studies conducted with MP-376 and urine concentrations were estimated in two (MPEX-202 and 203). Seven of 
these 9 studies were conducted in patients with CF including:  
 Four Phase 1 studies (MPEX-202 [included 6 healthy subjects], -203, -205 and -206) 
 One Phase 2 study (MPEX-204) 
 Two Phase 3 studies (MPEX-207 and MPEX-209) 
Two other studies with MP-376 were conducted in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   
In all studies (including MPEX-1) serum, sputum and urine levofloxacin concentrations were determined using a 
validated HPLC method with fluorescence detection appropriate to the individual matrix at inVentiv Health 
Clinical (formerly Anapharm - a PharmaNet Company), Québec, Canada. The initial validation gave a serum 
LLOQ ~100 ng/mL. Subsequent validations lowered the serum LLOQ to ~40 and then 20 ng/mL but increased 
the sputum LLOQ from ~5 to 50 ng/mL with urine LLOQ ~50 ng/mL. 
Formulations including 30 mg/mL (MP-376-001) and 50 mg/mL (MP-376-002) MP-376 were evaluated in Phase 
1 clinical studies using the MP-376 customized PARI eFlow® nebulizer. The final formulation (MP-376-003) was 
used in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, in MPEX-205 and in the COPD studies.   
There was a preliminary study (MPEX-1) that did not use MP-376 in which single aerosolized doses (loading 
doses 43 mg and 87 mg; estimated lung deposition of 20 mg and 40 mg) levofloxacin for parenteral use 
(Levaquin) were given to stable CF patients and healthy volunteers with the Pari eFlow® as well as a 50 mg 
single intravenous mg dose. An antacid [Al(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2] was administered orally prior to and after each 
inhaled dose to minimise oral absorption. 
The amount of levofloxacin excreted unchanged in urine over 24 hours and the renal clearance were fairly 
consistent for the healthy subjects and CF patients but the means were slightly lower for the CF patients. The 
amount but not the percentage of dose excreted in urine increased with predicted dose. Serum levofloxacin 
Cmax and AUC values were estimated to be approximately 10% of published concentrations achieved after a 
750 mg parenteral or oral dose. Absorption occurred significantly more slowly in CF patients and 50% of the lung 
dose appeared to remain in the lung for at least 0.5 hours after the dose.

Figure 1 
Using a literature value for ELF volume of 25 ml (Rennard et al., 1985) the estimated concentrations of 
levofloxacin in ELF fluid of CF patients after the two dose levels were derived. When integrated over time, the 
mean levofloxacin AUC (mg.h/L) in ELF was 365 and 710 for the low and high dose in healthy subjects compared 
to 354 and 1,199 for low and high doses in CF patients. The respective mean projected Cmax concentrations 
(mg/L) in lung fluid were 713 and 1189 vs. 354 and 1,199. The applicant stated that projected concentrations 
in sputum and ELF significantly exceeded the Cmax:MIC90 ratio > 20 target for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
the AUC:MIC 24h ratio was estimated to be > 300 for most P. aeruginosa CF isolates. 
In CF patients the AUCs in sputum increased with aerosol dose and were 27 (43 mg) and 70 (87 mg) times 
higher than the 50 mg intravenous dose. Concentrations tended to fall rapidly during the first 2 h of 
administration, consistent with drug absorption from the lung.  
In MPEX-202 the bioavailability of levofloxacin was estimated in healthy volunteers (8) and CF patients (10) 
after single ascending inhaled doses of MP-376 (78, 175 and 260 mg loaded doses). All participants received a 
single 50 mg IV bolus dose of levofloxacin (Levaquin) at a separate study visit. At 5 minutes before and after 
administration of inhaled and intravenous doses 15 mL antacid was administered orally (1 mL contained 40 mg 
magnesium oxide and 110 mg aluminium oxide). At the highest inhaled dose in CF patients Cmax was lower but 
AUC was slightly higher than observed for the IV dose. Levofloxacin elimination from plasma was similar to that 
described previously for systemic dosing.

In CF patients the inhaled formulation resulted in an approximate absolute bioavailability of 30% (based on the 
doses loaded into the nebulizer) and the median relative bioavailability was approximately 1.0 for the 175 mg 
and 260 mg doses when calculated as explained in the footnote.

2Derived as inhaled AUC0-∞ normalized to a 78 mg dose and divided by AUC0-∞f after 78 mg  
Based on use of a power model and ANOVA to compare dose-normalized AUC0-∞ and Cmax across inhaled 
doses, serum AUC0-∞ increased in a dose proportional manner with a beta parameter of 0.977 (95% CI 0.816 
– 1.14) but Cmax did not [0.752 (0.612 – 0.893)]. However, the comparison of Cmax for the 175 and 260 mg 
doses did show dose proportionality (LSM ratio 1.013). 
Arithmetic mean sputum exposures did not consistently increase with increasing inhalational doses in CF 
patients. However, exposures were much higher in sputum than serum in CF patients (median Cmax estimates 
were 100-250 x higher and AUC estimates were 40-200 x higher in sputum than in serum. 
In MPEX-203 single and multiple doses (loaded 78, 175, and 260 mg) were administered to CF patients up to 
twice daily for 14 days using the customised PARI eFlow® nebulizer. Mean serum PK parameters of levofloxacin 
increased proportionally after single and multiple doses. Neither CLr nor T1/2 appeared to be dependent on dose 
or duration of exposure. The CSR does not mention any pre/post antacid dosing.

There was an increase in the mean serum concentrations at all doses between Day 1 and Day 15.  Based on the 
ratios of the mean values for Cmax and AUC0-12 the degree of accumulation observed was consistent with the 
1.6-fold accumulation predicted by the overall mean T1/2 (7.13 h across all doses and study days) and BID 
dosing at an assumed interval of 12 h. 
Table 4 
There was a near dose proportional increase in the arithmetic mean sputum concentrations of levofloxacin on 
Day 1 and Day 15. Sputum exposures were 70 to 1000 times higher than in serum. Although the 
sputum-to-serum AUC ratio was relatively independent of the dose, it appeared to be lower on Day 15.  The 
applicant stated that this may reflect drug accumulation in serum, which was not apparent in sputum. 
MPEX-205 was a partial crossover study in which 10 CF patients received a single dose of 180 mg using 50 
mg/mL and 100 mg/mL formulations and then 7 days of 240 mg QD using the 100 mg/mL formulation, all using 
the customized PARI eFlow® nebulizer. All patients took oral antacid pre and post-study drug administration as 
in MPEX-202. The average baseline % predicted FEV1 for all patients was 67.10%.  
After the 180 mg single doses the mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ for the 100 mg/mL formulation were 35% and 22% 
higher vs. the 50 mg/mL formulation.  
Table 5 
Based on the mean serum t1/2 of 6.78 h after 180 mg as the 100 mg/mL formulation, the accumulation with 
once-daily dosing was predicted to be minimal (~9%). In fact, there was a 1.33-fold increase in the mean Cmax 
after administration of 240 mg as the 100 mg/mL formulation, which is similar to the difference in dose (180 mg 
vs. 240 mg).  
The applicant discussed that AUC(0-t) after 240 mg QD x 7 days was AUC(0-24), which should be equivalent to 
AUC(inf) after a single dose. Correcting the mean AUC(0-t) for the 240 mg dose (14,771 h.ng/mL) to 180 mg gave 
an estimate of 11,078 h.ng/mL, which was comparable to the observed AUC(inf) of 9,848 h.ng/mL after a single 
180 mg dose of the same formulation. The applicant concluded that the PK of levofloxacin after single and 
multiple-dose administration of the 100 mg/mL formulation of MP-376 was both linear (independent of dose) 
and stationary (independent of time). 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 35/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sputum exposure was 2,600 times higher than serum for Cmax and 250 times higher for AUC and was relatively 
independent of the formulation and the dose. There was a 1.6-fold increase in sputum Cmax and a 2.3-fold 
increase in AUC between the 180 mg and 240 mg doses of the 100 mg/mL formulation. The standard deviations 
were comparable to or greater than the means and thus a dose-proportional increase in sputum exposure could 
not be inferred.   
Table 6 
MPEX-206 evaluated use of the MP-376 100 mg/mL formulation in 27 paediatric patients with CF aged 6 to 16 
years. All received active treatment QD at weight-based loaded doses: 22-30 kg received 180 mg and >30 kg 
received 240 mg. Projected exposures for the 240 mg BID regimen were generated as follow: 
AUC0-24 was simulated as 2 x AUC0-12 (calculated by extrapolation) on Day 14 for QD dosing 
Cmax was simulated by extrapolating Clast (~8 h) to 12 h and then adding the delta Cmax for Day 14 
The predicted serum concentrations were broadly comparable between the two paediatric groups and adults. In 
contrast, the predicted sputum exposures in both the paediatric age subgroups were 3 to 4 times lower than 
sputum exposures at comparable serum exposures in adults; the applicant states that the clinical relevance of 
this finding is unclear. For a 240 mg BID regimen the predicted serum exposures in adolescents (12-16 years) 
were comparable with the POPPK values in adults in MPEX-204.

Table 8 
MPEX-204 was a Phase 2 placebo-controlled study that evaluated equal numbers of stable CF patients treated 
with MP-376 at 120 mg BID, 240 mg QD and 240 mg BID or placebo. Sparse PK sampling was employed and 
POPPK was used to estimate serum and sputum levofloxacin exposures at steady-state. The amount of 
inter-individual variability in PK was higher in MPEX-204 vs. the Phase 1 studies but a relatively simple 
four-compartmental model provided excellent fits of both the serum and sputum data.   
The mean steady-state levofloxacin Cmax estimates were 5,000 to 7,000 times higher in sputum than in serum 
while mean steady-state AUC0-24 estimates were approximately 300-fold higher in sputum than in serum. The 
mean steady-state systemic and sputum exposures increased proportionally with dose. Dose proportionality 
was supported by the fit of the model, which was similar among the three dose groups. 
Table 9 
MPEX-207 was a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study that evaluated MP-376 240 mg BID for 28 days in stable CF 
patients. PK data were obtained and analysed similar to MPEX-204. With 210 patients included in the analysis, 
the mean steady-state Cmax was approximately 3500-fold higher in sputum than in serum and the mean 
steady-state AUC0-24 estimate was approximately 400-fold higher in sputum than in serum. 
A comparison of the distribution of steady-state AUC(0-24) between MPEX-207 and patients in MPEX-204 who 
received MP-376 240 mg BID showed considerable overlap in the distributions of PK exposures between studies. 
The trend for lower AUC0-24 values in MPEX-207 was proposed to reflect some bias introduced by the fact that 
the analysis involved imputing the time of at-home doses.

Table 10 
Based on published PK data after oral dosing with levofloxacin in healthy male subjects, dosing with 240 mg BID 
MP-376 gave a mean population systemic exposure to levofloxacin < 60% of that observed after 250 mg orally 
and < 23% of the expected exposure after 500 mg QD orally for 14 days (see below).  
MPEX-209 compared MP-376 240 mg BID with tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in stable CF patients and 
applied the same PK methods. The mean steady-state Cmax estimate was approximately 1700-fold higher in 
sputum than in serum while the mean steady-state AUC(0-24) estimate was approximately 600-fold higher in 
sputum than in serum. There was considerable overlap in the distributions of PK exposures between MPEX-209 
and MPEX-204. The trend for lower serum AUC(0-24) values in MPEX-209 may reflect imputations (as proposed in 
MPEX-207).  
Table 11 
Based on the same comparisons as in MPEX-207, the mean population systemic exposure to levofloxacin 
following MP-376 240 mg BID was < 70% vs. 250 mg orally and ~25% vs. 500 mg QD oral dosing. Based on 
serum levofloxacin data observed with MP-376 240 mg BID dosing the mean steady-state serum AUC estimates 
were 2.7- to 3.1-fold lower than those reported in healthy subjects dosed with oral levofloxacin 500 mg QD. In 
addition, mean steady-state serum AUC estimates were 3.4- to 4.4-fold lower in patients with CF receiving 
MP-376 240 mg BID when compared to patients with CF receiving multiple doses of levofloxacin 500 mg QD 
given orally (see table below). Note that: Lee et al. [2007] reported plasma concentrations using HPLC; 
Pederson et al. [1987] reported serum concentrations measured using a microbiological method.

The applicant concluded that inhalational administration of MP-376 results in exposures to levofloxacin in the CF 
lung (based on sputum concentrations) that are consistently over 100-fold higher than those achievable after 
dosing with oral ofloxacin (50% of which is levofloxacin) in patients with CF.  
The applicant has not conducted any other PK studies with levofloxacin. Since levofloxacin exhibits linear PK 
after systemic and inhalational administration, the applicant states that publicly available information on 
levofloxacin is relevant to the basic pharmacology and the effect of intrinsic or extrinsic factors after 
administration by inhalation of MP-376. 
Revised POPPK analysis and revised estimates of systemic exposure following use of MP-376 
In MPEX-201, 202 and 205 there was pre-and post-dose administration of an oral antacid [Al(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2] 
5 minutes prior to and after each inhaled dose to minimise oral absorption. From MPEX-202 the estimated 
absolute bioavailability after inhalation was about 30% but this was based on systemic levels in CF patients who 
took oral antacid. The applicant was requested to further justify the validity of this estimate. 
In the Phase 2/3 studies there was no requirement for antacid use but it was not precluded. The refined POPPK 
analysis was based on data obtained from: 
o  3 Phase 1 studies (MPEX-203, MPEX-205 and MPEX-206) 
o  1 Phase 2 study (MPEX-204) 
o  2 Phase 3 studies (MPEX-207 and MPEX-209) 
The final refined POPPK model consisted of a 2-compartment model for levofloxacin after absorption with linear 
elimination from the central compartment and first-order absorption via the depot compartment. This relatively 
simple model provided an adequate fit to the serum levofloxacin concentration-time data pooled from six studies 
of MP-376 in patients with CF. 
The only covariate relationship of statistical significance was that between apparent inhaled clearance of 
levofloxacin and creatinine clearance. Specifically, there were no apparent relationships between age, body size, 
FEV1, concomitant antacids or MP-376 formulation and serum levofloxacin PK. 
The refined model was used to re-estimate systemic exposure to levofloxacin following inhalation of MP-376 240 
mg BID and concluded that this is about 50% of that observed after oral and IV administration of 500 mg QD. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 39/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the refined POPPK model the steady-state AUC0-24 was estimated to be 20.93 ± 12.51 µg∙h/mL and 
Cmax was estimated to be 2.39 ± 0.97 µg/mL following 240 mg BID MP-376.  
These data gave an estimated absolute bioavailability of 45% compared to the observed IV data in the 
Levaquin® label for 500 mg QD and 53% compared to the IV data obtained in MPEX-202 (see below).

Additional modelling applied to paediatric exposures 
To determine whether age is a significant covariate on CL, Vd or F a linear, 2-compartment PK model was fitted 
to the data in agreement with a dose-proportional PK profile following oral administration. In this refined model 
age was not found to be a significant covariate of CL/F, V/F or F.   
Predicted steady state systemic exposures following dosing with 240 mg BID in adults and children using the 
refined population PK model showed that MP-376 serum concentrations were comparable between paediatric 
subjects in the age range 12-<18 years and adult groups.

Renal function 
Although decreasing renal function (estimated creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) is associated with decreased 
renal elimination and clearance of levofloxacin with increased t1/2 dose adjustments were not made in the 
Phase 2/3 studies and patients with estimated creatinine clearance from 20 mL/min were eligible based on the 
systemic availability of levofloxacin following inhalation of MP-376. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted with MP-376. However, it is known that levofloxacin 
undergoes minimal metabolism (desmethyl-levofloxacin and levofloxacin-N-oxide account for 1.75% and 
1.63% of the dose excreted in urine, respectively. Also, levofloxacin renal clearance (95 to 125 mL/min) is 
slightly higher than glomerular filtration rate (100 mL/min) suggesting that renal tubular secretion is involved in 
its elimination. In the literature tubular secretion of levofloxacin has been proposed to be mediated possibly via 
the P-glycoprotein transporter. 
From the literature, the applicant reported that in-vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the key 
transporters associated with drug disposition in the kidney (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2) at 
exposures following inhalation of 240 mg levofloxacin twice daily is low. Furthermore, clinical data do not 
suggest an interaction of levofloxacin with P-gp substrates such as digoxin. Levofloxacin may be a weak inhibitor 
of CYP2C9. Nevertheless, the high IC50 (210 μmol/L) suggests that a clinical effect is unlikely following 
inhalational administration of MP-376.  
Only small increases of levofloxacin exposure are expected due to co-administration with other drugs. 
Inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome P450 do not significantly affect levofloxacin exposure. Levofloxacin may be a 
substrate of the renal transporters OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. However, in-vivo DDI studies conducted with oral 
levofloxacin and probenecid (inhibitor of OAT1/OAT3) and cimetidine (inhibitor of OCT2) showed a reduction of 
renal clearance of levofloxacin by 35% or less, which was associated with increases in mean AUC by 27% and 
38%, respectively. Given that systemic exposure following 240 mg BID is on average about 50% of orally 
administered levofloxacin (500 mg QD), the applicant considered that the increase in levofloxacin 
concentrations by inhibitors of renal transporters was not clinically significant but proposed caution when these 
drugs are co-administered with inhaled MP-376.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
As a member of the fluoroquinolone class, levofloxacin disrupts bacterial DNA replication by inhibiting type II 
topoisomerase-DNA complexes. The two type II topoisomerases - DNA gyrase (GyrA in P. aeruginosa) and 
topoisomerase IV (ParC in P. aeruginosa) - are very similar in amino acid sequence but play distinct roles in DNA 
replication. Disruption of DNA replication eventually results in bacterial death. 
Acquired decreases in in-vitro susceptibility to fluoroquinolones arise predominantly through:  
1)  
2)  
3)  
4) 
Mutations in the quinolone resistance determinant region (QRDR) of GyrA and ParC. Strains with higher 
levels of acquired resistance commonly have mutations in GyrA and ParC QRDRs.  
Chromosomal  mutations  that  alter  porin  diffusion  channel  expression  so  reducing  drug  permeation 
across the gram-negative outer membrane. 
Acquired mutations that alter the expression of endogenous efflux pumps and increase fluoroquinolone 
translocation across the inner bacterial membrane and out of the cytoplasm.  
Acquired plasmids that encode proteins that protect the topoisomerase target sites from inhibition (qnr 
resistance) 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Studies of systemic fluoroquinolone administration in animal models of infection as well as in human infection 
indicate that the AUC0-24/MIC ratio and the Cmax/MIC ratio best predict antibacterial effect and clinical efficacy. 
There are no robust animal models of chronic P. aeruginosa infection of CF airways that lend themselves well to 
PK/PD modeling relevant to inhaled anti-pseudomonal agents. However, aerosolized levofloxacin has been 
studied in an acute P. aeruginosa mouse lung infection model in which it gave larger reductions in lung bacterial 
load and increased survival vs. intra-peritoneal injection.   
Based on a predicted increase in QTcI change from baseline of 2.5 ms/7 µg/mL levofloxacin the mean 
steady-state Cmax in patients with CF given MP-376 240 mg BID (1.36 - 3.36 µg/mL) would correspond to a 0.5 
to 1.2 ms increase in QTcI change from baseline. The 95th percentiles for serum levofloxacin Cmax in patients with 
CF given MP-376 240 mg BID in MPEX-204, MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 were 2.36, 2.65 and 6.29 µg/mL, 
respectively. The corresponding predicted increases in QTcI change from baseline are calculated to be 0.843, 
0.946 and 2.26 ms, respectively.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK analyses indicate that inhalation of MP-376 can result in levofloxacin AUC(0-24)/MIC and Cmax/MIC ratios 
at the site of infection that are several orders of magnitude higher than achieved with systemic administration. 
However, evidence to link AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC ratios in sputum with improvement in lung function is lacking 
so the clinical effect cannot be predicted from these data. 
The serum concentrations of levofloxacin achieved after inhalation of loaded doses of 240 mg BID would be 
expected to represent the total of swallowing of drug and absorption from the gut (the absolute bioavailability of 
oral levofloxacin is > 90%) and any absorption there may be from the respiratory tract. The initial estimate of 
absolute bioavailability after inhalation (30%) was potentially compromised by pre-and post-dose 
administration of an oral antacid. Using the refined POPPK model and data from Phase 2/3 in which antacid use 
was allowed but not mandated the revised estimate was ~50% when compared with 500 mg QD oral or IV 
doses. An additional issue is the degree of inter-individual variability that has been observed with 240 mg BID 
MP-376 dosing (typically Cmax CV% 49% and AUC CV% 77%). 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 42/106 
 
  
  
  
Taking into account the CV% and the comparisons made with systemic dosing there is clearly very considerable 
systemic exposure to levofloxacin after inhalation of 240 mg BID MP-376. This contrasts with the relatively low 
exposures observed after inhalation of poorly absorbed agents such as tobramycin, colistin (both little absorbed 
via lung or gut) and aztreonam (Cmax is about 1% of that after 500 mg IV).  
Quinsair is proposed for use in 28-day cycles and for repeated usage. Even if it is actually used in rotation with 
one or more other approved inhalational agents there is a real potential that in every year there could be 
multiple 28-day courses administered.  
The available safety data are too limited even in adults to assess the possible effects of such chronic substantial 
systemic exposures. There are some data available in the literature on chronic systemic exposure to levofloxacin 
when issued to treat other types of infection (such as tuberculosis and osteomyelitis) but it is not possible to 
address the likely safety profile in CF patients after repeated inhalational cycles from such data. 
In response to these concerns the applicant removed the indication for use from the age of 12 years at the same 
dose (240 mg BID) as in adults. Although the refined POPPK analysis confirmed comparable systemic exposures 
in adolescents vs. adults and despite the fact that systemic fluoroquinolone use is established in the CF 
paediatric patient population, such usage is quite different to that anticipated with Quinsair since it is generally 
over short periods (< 2weeks) to treat exacerbations. There are also inadequate safety data to definitely 
describe the safety profile that can be expected in adults who are exposed over prolonged periods and in 
repeated cycles.  
Although the systemic exposure to levofloxacin is substantial it is unlikely to exceed that observed after 500 mg 
QD oral or IV dosing. However, the potential risks associated with QT prolongation when Quinsair is given to 
predisposed subjects cannot be dismissed. Hence, caution should be applied when using fluoroquinolones, 
including levofloxacin, in patients with known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval. This potential risk 
is reflected in the Risk Management Plan and included in SmPC section 4.4. (Special warnings and precautions 
for use), a statement to this effect has been added. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
With systemic exposures that are on average ~50% of those achieved with oral and IV dosing there were major 
concerns regarding the safety of 28-day cycles in adolescents that cannot be addressed from the available data. 
The applicant removed the indication for use from the age of 12 years, at the same dose (240 mg BID) as in 
adults.  There are also inadequate safety data to definitely describe the safety profile that can be expected in 
adults who are exposed over prolonged periods and in repeated cycles. Therefore, the use of Quinsair in subjects 
aged ≥ 18 years is subject to cautionary SmPC wording and a detailed Risk Management Plan. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In MPEX-203, 205 and 206 data on pulmonary function were mainly obtained with the purpose of assessing 
any possible negative effects of MP-376 on pulmonary function in short term use.  
The main efficacy data come from the following Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.

[1] The Placebo group was subdivided to match the dosing regimens of the active treatment groups. 
[2] All patients received MP-376 during MPEX-209 Extension Phase regardless of treatment with MP-376 or TIS during the 
Core Phase. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
MPEX-204 
This dose-finding study shared many general features of design with the Phase 3 studies but it enrolled only 
patients aged at least 16 years. Randomisation was into four equal groups (3 active: 1 placebo [normal saline]) 
with sub-division of the placebo group to match each of the three active regimens. There was stratification by 
geographic region (US or non-US). Non-study anti-pseudomonal agents were not allowed unless deemed 
necessary by the investigator (i.e. to treat exacerbations). 
The primary analysis compared the average change in log CFU of P. aeruginosa per gram of sputum from day 1 
to day 28 of treatment with MP-376 or placebo based on the combined MP-376 240 mg groups (QD and BID) and 
the pooled placebo group. The comparison was performed using a repeated-measures mixed model that 
included terms for treatment group, visit, treatment by visit interaction, geographical region, baseline value, 
highest baseline MIC of levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa (log2-transformed), baseline percent predicted FEV1 
(categorised as quartiles) and visit by baseline interaction. The model assumed an unstructured covariance 
matrix.  
Approximately 190 patients were to be screened to enrol 140 patients (assuming a 25% screen failure rate) at 
50 sites. A total of 128 patients (32/treatment arm) would provide 80% power to detect a difference between 
treatment arms using a 2-sided analysis of variance (ANOVA), with 5% alpha, assuming a standard deviation of 
1.5 and a mean log CFU change in P. aeruginosa of 0.75 decrease, 0.75 decrease, no change and 0.25 increase 
for the MP-376 240 mg BID, 240 mg QD, 120 mg QD and placebo groups, respectively. Calculations assumed a 
10% discontinuation rate. 
Of 151 patients enrolled 94.7% completed the study. Most discontinuations from study and from study drug 
were due to AEs. The age range was 16-56 years, baseline mean FEV1 and % predicted FEV1 were 1.95 L and 
52%, respectively, and 72% had received ≥4 courses of antimicrobial therapy within one year.

The change in P. aeruginosa density for the combined 240 mg QD and BID groups vs. pooled placebo in the EE 
Population after 28 days of dosing was highly statistically significant (p = 0.0002). The differences between the 
pooled placebo group and each of the three MP-376 dose groups at Day 28 were also statistically significant, 
with evidence of a dose response. 
Figure 3 
In the EE population the 240 BID group had the greatest reduction in P. aeruginosa density at Day 28, with a 
-1.19 log CFU/g difference vs. placebo (p = 0.002). By Day 56 P. aeruginosa density returned toward baseline 
levels in all three MP-376 groups.  
The MITT population also showed a statistically significant reduction in P. aeruginosa density at day 28 for the 
combined MP-376 240 mg QD and BID groups vs. placebo group (p = 0.0039). Results for the MITT 240 mg BID 
group are summarised below for primary and other endpoints. 
Table 13

All dose levels of MP-376 resulted in a reduction in the need for systemic or inhaled anti-pseudomonal agents vs. 
placebo over the treatment and follow-up periods (last follow-up was at day 56).  
Table 14 
An increase in FEV1 (note: as percent change from day 1) was observed in all MP-376 treatment groups over the 
28-day treatment period in the EE and MITT populations.  
Table 15 
The proportions in MITT and EE populations with an increase in FEV1 on day 28 of 10% or greater was highest 
in the MP-376 240 mg BID group and at day 42 the percent improvement in FEV1 continued to be significantly 
better vs. placebo but FEV1 values returned toward baseline in all groups by day 56. 
At baseline the mean FEV1 percent predicted was 52.4 for the placebo group and 48.8 for the 240 mg BID group. 
Among those followed at day 28 the mean values for FEV1 percent predicted were 50.9 and 50.8 in respective 
groups, giving actual changes from their mean baseline of -1.5 and +3.1 percentage points and mean relative 
percent changes from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted of -3.08 and +7.97. The difference in mean relative 
change between the placebo group and the MP-376 240 mg BID group was highly statistically significant in EE 
and MITT populations but there was no significant difference at day 42. The comparisons between 240 mg QD, 
but not 120 mg QD, vs. placebo also reached significance.

For the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R, improvements were observed in all MP-376 dose groups. In the MITT 
population at day 28 there was a mean improvement in each of the MP-376 groups but no statistically significant 
differences compared to placebo. The 240 mg BID group had statistically significant improvement over placebo 
at day 14.

Title of Study 
MPEX 207: A Phase 3, Multi-center, Multinational, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebocontrolled 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MP-376 (Levofloxacin Inhalation Solution; Aeroquin) in Stable 
Cystic Fibrosis Patients 
MPEX 209: A Phase 3, Open-label, Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
MP-376 Inhalation Solution (Aeroquin™) Versus Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (TIS) in 
Stable Cystic Fibrosis Patients 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible patients for MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 were aged ≥12 years with body weight ≥ 30 kg. Diagnosis of CF 
required one or more clinical features consistent with CF phenotype and at least one of: 
a) Sweat chloride ≥ 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test 
b) Two well-characterized mutations in the CFTR gene 
c) Abnormal nasal potential difference 
Patients were to have: 
-  
-  
FEV1 > 25.0% but < 85.0% predicted value at screening based on NHANES III criteria 
Sputum or throat swab (if unable to produce sputum) at screening positive for P. aeruginosa and at least 
one sputum culture positive for P. aeruginosa within the last 12 months 
At least three 28-day courses or total of 84 days of an inhaled antimicrobial (any in MPEX-207; in 
- 
MPEX-209 this was specified to be tobramycin) during the previous 12 months and at least a 14-day course 
within 29 to 84 days (MPEX-207) or 29-56 days (MPEX-209) 
- 
- 
- 
Clinically stable and non-smoking within prior 28 days 
Calculated C-G CrCl at least 20 mL/min  
Oxygen saturation > 90% on room air 
Treatments 
In MPEX-207 MP-376 240 mg [one ampoule] BID or placebo BID for 28 days was self-administered by the 
patient using the MP-376-customised PARI eFlow® nebulizer (CE marked) except for doses at scheduled visits. 
Study and any routine non-study treatments were to be given in strict order (bronchodilators, pulmozyme or 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 47/106 
 
  
  
  
hypertonic saline, ACTs, Study Drug and lastly inhaled steroids. The placebo contained riboflavin 5´-phosphate 
(Vitamin B2) in 0.9% saline. 
In MPEX-209 MP-376 240 mg BID was self-administered using the MP-376-customised PARI eFlow® nebulizer. 
Other features of treatment management were as for MPEX-207 except that: 
o  Tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) 300 mg BID was self-administered using the PARI LC® PLUS nebulizer 
(which was dispensed to almost all participants) or, if unavailable, another nebulizer. Compressors were 
also provided by the sponsor. 
o 
o  Patients administered 3 consecutive 56-day cycles (28 days on treatment and 28 days off treatment) in the 
core study. All patients were offered 3 consecutive 56-day cycles (28 days on/28 days off treatment) with 
MP-376 240 mg BID in the extension study such that the initial TIS group patients received 3 cycles and 
those previously treated with MP-376 received up to 6 cycles in total. 
In MPEX-207 patients who started any other inhaled or systemic anti-pseudomonal agent due to an 
exacerbation or worsening symptoms were to permanently discontinue study drug but the patient was to 
continue study visits. Starting any other anti-pseudomonal agent in the absence of exacerbation or 
worsening did not absolutely require stopping study treatment.  
In MPEX-209 study treatment was to be stopped during treatment of an exacerbation or when deemed 
necessary by an investigator and was then to be re-started at the same schedule as before. 
o 
All patients administered 2 puffs of a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. albuterol, salbutamol) 10-30 minutes 
prior to starting PFTs at each study visit. Use of a bronchodilator prior to study drug was recommended if PFTs 
showed a ≥ 15% relative decrease in FEV1 from pre-dose plus symptoms. PFTs were performed and reviewed 
according to ATS and ERS Spirometry Standards. A designated centralised over-reader determined if a 
spirometry session was acceptable and which efforts were considered the best for FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75. 
Spirometry sessions for each patient were conducted at the same time (± 2 hours) throughout the study to 
control for diurnal variation.    
Respiratory samples were collected and processed according to the Laboratory Manual and there were 
designated central laboratories.

Sample size 
MPEX-207 
In the initial protocol, based on MPEX-204, the event-free rate in the placebo arm at Day 56 was estimated to 
be 0.50, with the event being the use of systemic or inhaled anti-pseudomonal agents. With 2:1 (MP-376: 
placebo) randomisation and a maximum follow-up time of 56 days, and based on the use of a 2-sided log rank 
test at the 5% level of significance, a total sample size of 261 patients would be required to have 90% power to 
detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.52 (ratio of the risk of use of a systemic or inhaled antimicrobial for a pulmonary 
exacerbation in the MP-376 arm to the risk of same for a pulmonary exacerbation in the placebo arm). 
In the amended protocol (Amendment 2.0), relative change in FEV1 percent predicted was identified as a 
secondary endpoint of interest. Following this change, the planned sample size was increased to 330 patients to 
provide > 90% power to detect an 8.0 percentage point treatment difference in relative change in FEV1 percent 
predicted, based on a 2-sided test at the 5% level of significance and assuming a standard 
deviation of 20% and 2:1 randomisation to MP-376:placebo. Approximately 415 patients were to be screened to 
enrol approximately 330 patients, assuming a 20% screening failure rate. 
MPEX-209 
Approximately 330 patients were to be screened at approximately 100 sites to enrol 267 patients, assuming a 
20% screen failure rate. 
The sample size was determined for an assessment of the primary endpoint (relative change in FEV1 percent 
predicted from baseline to day 28) with a non-inferiority margin of 4%, a standard deviation (SD) of 18% and 
a discontinuation rate of 10% up to day 28. The sample size calculation assumed that MP-376 was 4 percentage 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014

points better than TIS. On this basis, 267 patients randomised 2:1 to MP-376 and TIS, respectively, would 
provide 90% power with a 2-sided significance level of 5% (equivalent to a 1-sided significance level of 2.5%). 
Justification for this non-inferiority margin was based on data from the TIS vs. placebo studies reported by 
Ramsey et al., 1999. The pooled SD for the relative change in FEV1 percent predicted at day 28 in the population 
of all patients who received a dose of study drug was 20.4% (derived from inspection of the plotted limits of the 
95% CI from the publication). Based on the SD the lower limit of the 90% CI for the difference between TIS and 
placebo was 9.05. Preserving 50% of this conservative estimate of the treatment effect based on the lower 
bound of the 90% CI justified a non-inferiority margin of 4.525%. A more conservative estimate of 4% was 
agreed upon with CHMP (2010). 
The primary efficacy assessment of non-inferiority was conducted at day 28, which was the same time point 
used for calculating the non-inferiority margin from the Ramsey publication and the key inclusion criteria for 
MPEX-209 were similar. Although other treatments have been added to the care of CF patients since the Ramsey 
study (e.g. oral azithromycin and inhaled hypertonic saline), it is unclear if these treatments can influence the 
response to aerosol antimicrobials. 
Analysis of data from the Phase 2 placebo-controlled study MPEX-204 indicated that the clinical response 
(improvement in pulmonary function) with MP-376 was of similar magnitude as that seen in other trials of 
inhaled antimicrobials in patients with or without these background therapies. In addition, changes in pulmonary 
function with MP-376 at 28 days appeared to be of the same magnitude or greater than that observed with 
dornase alfa, azithromycin or inhaled hypertonic saline  
In the analysis of AEs, 178 patients treated with MP-376 would give approximately a 0.9 probability of observing 
a particular type or class of AE if the true incidence was 1.3%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive MP-376 240 mg BID or placebo/TIS BID. There was 
stratification by geographic region (US, non-US), age (12 to 18 years, > 18 years) and FEV1 percent predicted 
(< 55%, ≥ 55%) at screening. 
There was an independent Blinded Exacerbation Adjudication Committee (BEAC). Presence of symptoms/signs 
consistent with an exacerbation along with the start and stop dates of each worsening symptom were captured 
using the RSSQ administered to the patient. To meet the definition of an exacerbation, patients must 
concurrently have had at least 4/12 symptoms/signs as defined by the modified Fuchs criteria, discontinued 
from the study early for any reason (MPEX-207 only), died, or received an anti-pseudomonal agent for an event 
that did not meet the Fuchs criteria but was determined to be an exacerbation for the purposes of the primary 
endpoint by the BEAC.  
Blinding (masking) 
MPEX-207 was double blind and placebo controlled. The formulations were similar in colour but were not 
taste-matched.  
MPEX-209 was open label and active controlled. 
Statistical methods 
In MPEX-207 efficacy analyses were performed in two populations: 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 50/106 
 
  
  
  
ITT = all randomised; analyses were based on randomised and not actual treatment. 
o 
o  Efficacy  Evaluable  (EE)  =  all  patients  randomised  in  the  study  without  pre-specified  major  protocol 
violations who received at least 80% of study drug doses  
The primary efficacy comparison was conducted in the ITT population and compared the distributions of time to 
exacerbation between the MP-376 and placebo groups using a 2-sided stratified (see factors above) log rank test 
at the 5% level of significance.  
The time-to-event distributions in the groups were summarised using the Kaplan-Meier method. Various 
sensitivity analyses were performed. Missing values were imputed using worst treatment average change or 
worst treatment average percent change. Sensitivity analyses used other imputation methods. 
Based on the primary analysis 261 patients were required to have 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.52 (ratio of the risk of use of a systemic or inhaled antimicrobial for a pulmonary exacerbation in the MP-376 
arm to the risk of same for a pulmonary exacerbation in the placebo arm). When relative change in FEV1 percent 
predicted was identified as a secondary endpoint of interest the planned sample size was increased to 330 
patients to provide > 90% power to detect an 8.0 percentage point treatment difference in relative change in 
FEV1 percent predicted, based on a 2-sided test at the 5% level of significance and assuming a standard 
deviation of 20% and 2:1 randomisation. 
In MPEX-209 efficacy analyses were performed in the following populations: 
ITT = all randomised; analyses were based on randomised and not actual treatment. 
o 
o  Day 28 EE (EE28) = all patients randomised in the study without pre-specified major protocol violations 
who received at least 80% of study drug doses during the first 28-day treatment period 
o  Day 140 EE (EE140) = as for EE28 but defined but over the three 28-day treatment periods 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population and compared the mean relative change in FEV1 
percent predicted from baseline to day 28 using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included terms 
for treatment group (MP-376 vs. TIS), geographic region (US vs. non-US), age (12 to 18 years vs. > 18 years) 
and baseline FEV1 percent predicted (< 55% vs. ≥ 55%). An unstructured covariance matrix was used in the 
ANCOVA.  
The assessment of non-inferiority was based on the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 
difference in means (MP-376 minus TIS). If the lower limit of this CI was greater than -4.0, then non-inferiority 
was demonstrated. If non-inferiority was demonstrated, then assessment of superiority for both relative change 
and absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 was to be performed using a 2-sided test 
at the 5% level of significance. On this basis, 267 patients randomised 2:1 to MP-376 and TIS, respectively, 
would provide 90% power with a 2-sided significance level of 5%. 
Results for MPEX 207 
Participant flow 
The study was conducted globally (but the majority of sites were in the US) during 2010-2012. There were 329 
treated patients of which 95.5% MP-376 and 99.1% placebo patients completed the study. Rates for 
discontinuation of study drug before day 28 were 15.5% and 14.5% in respective groups, mostly due to starting 
another antimicrobial agent due to worsening symptoms or exacerbation (9.5% vs. 11.8%).

Table 16 
The mean age was 29.2 years (range 12 to 62 years) and 84.5% were aged over 18 years. The baseline 
characteristics for respiratory function and CF disease-related parameters were mostly comparable. The mean 
FEV1 was 2.05 L in both groups and the mean FEV1 percent predicted values were 56.3 and 56.6. All patients 
had P. aeruginosa at screening and 96.0% at baseline of which most had levofloxacin MICs above the parenteral 
treatment CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints. The mean number of treated pulmonary exacerbations in the last 12 
months was 2.0 for MP-376 and 1.6 for placebo but 34% vs. 20% had 3 or more pulmonary exacerbations.  
Numbers analysed 
The most frequent reason for exclusion of patients from the EE population was less than 80% overall adherence 
(14.1% MP-376, 15.5% placebo).

Outcomes and estimation 
During the study 55.5% of MP-376 and 47.3% of placebo patients experienced a pulmonary exacerbation. Most 
who met the protocol definition of an exacerbation had at least 4/12 modified Fuchs criteria (86.1% MP-376 and 
84.6% placebo). There were 15.9% MP-376 and 12.7% placebo patients who met 4/12 modified Fuchs criteria 
but did not receive anti-pseudomonal agents within 14 days while 15.0% vs. 25.5%, respectively, received an 
anti-pseudomonal agent but did not meet 4/12 modified Fuchs criteria.  
There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of time to first exacerbation (ITT HR = 1.33; 
95% CI: 0.96, 1.84) and the trend favoured the placebo group, with medians of 58 days in the placebo group 
and 51.5 days in the MP-376 group. Results were similar for the EE population.

Figure 6 
In a series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint in the ITT population the HRs ranged from 1.06 to 
1.70, which was consistent with the HR of 1.33 in the primary analysis. When the determination of the BEAC was 
substituted for the RSSQ the HR was 1.34 (95% CI 0.95, 1.89). Also, using a statistical model that included the 
number of previous exacerbations in the prior year requiring antimicrobial treatment (≤ 2, > 2 exacerbations) 
the HR was 1.22 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.70). 
Based on worst treatment average change imputation, all of the subgroups that contained at least 15% of the 
patients in both treatment groups had a shorter time to exacerbation for placebo than MP-376 (HR greater than 
1.0). The differences between treatments were statistically significant for age > 18 years (p = 0.0062), white 
race (p = 0.0421), baseline FEV1 percent predicted < 55% (p = 0.0160), > 5 courses of inhaled antimicrobial 
in past year (p = 0.0224) and co-infection with S. aureus at baseline (p = 0.0220). 
Ancillary analyses 
In contrast to the primary analysis, some secondary analyses suggested a benefit for MP-376 or no difference 
between treatments.

Analysis of absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 (ITT population) showed 
increases with both treatments but the difference was statistically significant favouring MP-376 (p = 0.0137). A 
similar result occurred at day 14 (p = 0.0008). Subgroup analyses also favoured MP-376. 
Figure 7 
Figure 8 
In the 46 patients aged from 12 to < 18 years the exacerbation-free survival rates were 53.3% for MP-376 and 
25.0% for placebo. The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards regression model was 0.51 (95% CI 
0.22, 1.15) and the p-value from the log-rank test was 0.0693. Hence, in this subgroup the post hoc analysis 
suggested a trend to a benefit for levofloxacin over placebo.

The baseline FEV1 percent predicted in this age sub-group was higher than for the overall population. As shown 
below, the absolute and relative changes in FEV1 percent predicted both favoured MP-376. There was no 
appreciable difference between treatments for change in P. aeruginosa sputum density or change in respiratory 
domain of the CFQ-R.

Results for MPEX 209 
Participant flow 
Of the 282 patients randomised there were 272 treated, including 61 who had been enrolled into MPEX-204 or 
207. Most patients (nearly 90%) completed the study up to the day 168 (month 6) visit. Permanent 
discontinuation of study drug (prior to day 140) occurred in 12.7% MP-376 and 15.1% TIS patients. In the 
MP-376 group the most common reason was an AE (6.3%) but in the TIS group the most common cause was 
starting antimicrobial agents (5.4%).

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended (Amendment 2, protocol Version 3.0, 09 December 2011) to add an extension phase 
in which, at 45 specified sites, all patients who were clinically stable at Day 168 on either study drug (MP-376 or 
TIS) were given the option to receive 3 cycles of MP-376. The extension phase is the subject of a separate 
clinical study report (see below for a separate presentation of the results). 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment groups.  
Table 21 – Baseline Characteristics, Safety Population 
The mean age was 28.5 years (range 12 to 63 years) and 86.4% were ≥ 18 years old. Baseline respiratory 
function parameters were also similar between treatment groups with mean FEV1 2L and mean FEV1 percent 
predicted of 55.3 for MP-376 and 52.9 for TIS. At baseline 95.6% had P. aeruginosa isolated in 18.4% of patients 
and most had MICs of levofloxacin above the parenteral treatment resistance breakpoints of the CLSI and 
EUCAST. Resistance to tobramycin based on systemic breakpoints was observed in 34% and 36% in the TIS and 
MP-376 groups, respectively. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 59/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported CF-related conditions were pancreatic insufficiency (91.2%), gastro-oesophageal 
reflux disease (33.8%), clubbing (33.8%), chronic sinusitis (29.8%), diabetes mellitus (29.8%) and asthma 
(22.4%). The mean time since diagnosis was 25 years (range 2 to 54 years).  
Concomitant medications taken during treatment periods by over 80% of patients in either treatment group 
included drugs for obstructive airway disease, cough and cold preparations, digestives (including enzymes) and 
antibacterials for systemic use. Individual medications used by over 20% of patients in either treatment group 
were dornase alfa (73.6%, 81.1%), azithromycin (68.7%, 75.6%), pancreatin (64.8%, 63.3%), salbutamol 
(62.1%, 57.8%), sodium chloride (48.4%, 53.3%), Seretide (35.7%, 33.3%), pancrelipase (24.2%, 23.3%), 
ursodeoxycholic acid (23.6%, 25.6%), ibuprofen (23.6%, 14.4%), omeprazole (23.1%, 27.8%), ciprofloxacin 
(23.1%, 25.6%), vitamin ADEK (13.2%, 24.4%) and fluticasone propionate (16.5%, 21.1%). 
The only ATC drug class started by over 20% of patients in either treatment group was antibacterials for 
systemic use, which was more common in the TIS group (35.7% MP-376, 46.7% TIS). The only concomitant 
medication started during cycle 1 by over 5% of patients in either treatment group was ciprofloxacin (4.4% 
MP-376, 11.1% TIS). 
The only ATC drug class started during off-treatment periods by over 20% of patients in either treatment group 
was antibacterials for systemic use (65.6% MP-376, 50.5% TIS). The only differences of at least 5.0% between 
the treatment groups were greater use of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, Bactrim, colistin and meropenem in the TIS 
group.  
Numbers analysed 
The most frequent reason for exclusion from both the EE28 population and EE140 population was less than 80% 
overall study drug adherence (EE28: 12.7% MP-376, 12.9% TIS and EE140: 21.7% MP-376, 25.8% TIS). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary analysis demonstrated non-inferiority of MP-376 relative to TIS with LS mean difference between 
groups of 1.86 and the 95% CI -0.66 to 4.39% (LL > pre-specified -4%). The LS means for relative change in 
FEV1 percent predicted at day 28 (2.24 for MP-376 and 0.38 for TIS) favoured MP-376 but statistical evidence 
of superiority was not demonstrated (p = 0.1481). 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 60/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Table 22 
Ancillary analyses 
In a series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint that explored the effect of missing data in the ITT 
population the lower limit of the LS mean difference 95% CI was greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority 
margin of -4% in all cases. 
For the primary endpoint MP-376 was also non-inferior to TIS in the EE28 population. The LS means for relative 
change in FEV1 percent predicted from Baseline at Day 28 in this population were 2.97 for MP-376 and 0.34 for 
TIS, for a difference of 2.63 with 95% CI of -0.25 to 5.51%. 
As shown in the figure, the relative changes in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to the end of each 
treatment period were modest even in the MP-376 group. However, the relative change in FEV1 percent 
predicted from baseline numerically favoured MP-376 at the end of each treatment period. At the end of the 
off-treatment periods (days 56, 112, and 168/ET) the LS means were similar and below baseline values for both 
treatment groups with LS mean differences of -0.12, -0.59 and 0.55 at respective time points.

The categorical analysis of relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 showed 
improvement for 69.8% of MP-376 patients vs. 52.7% of TIS patients, which was statistically significant (p = 
0.0167). The remaining patients had a mild or moderate decline. The treatment difference was also statistically 
significant favouring MP-376 at Day 84 (p = 0.0271) but not at any other time points. 
The results of subgroup analyses for relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to Day 28 generally 
favoured MP-376. None of these differences between the treatments was statistically significant except for US 
region (p = 0.0250) and baseline FEV1 percent predicted ≥ 55% (p = 0.0173).  
As shown in the table above, the absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 was small 
in both treatment groups. The LS means for absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline for the 
MP-376 group showed an increase at days 28, 84 and 140 that ranged between 1.12 and 1.34. In comparison, 
the LS means for the TIS group showed an increase at days 28 and 140 and a decrease at day 84 (between 
–0.26 and 0.20). Hence the results numerically favoured MP-376 at the end of each on-treatment period and the 
difference at day 84 (1.60) was statistically significant (p = 0.034). At day 168/ET both groups showed a 
decrease from baseline and the LS mean difference was -0.28.  
The categorical analysis of absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 showed 
improvement for 69.8% of MP-376 patients and 52.7% of TIS patients. The remaining patients had a mild or 
moderate decline. At day 84 improvement was reported for 64.7% of MP-376 patients compared with 46.4% of 
TIS patients and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0376). 
The subgroup analyses for absolute change in FEV1 favoured MP-376 except for non-US region but none of the 
differences was statistically significant except for US region (p = 0.0281) and baseline FEV1 percent predicted 
≥ 55% (p = 0.0151). 
In the ITT population, the time to first exacerbation from baseline to Final Visit tended to be longer in the MP-376 
group (median 131 days) than in the TIS group (median 90.5 days) but there was no statistically significant 
difference (HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.07). Proportions who were exacerbation-free were 41.3% for MP-376 
and 33.3% for TIS. 
Figure 12 
The subgroup analyses showed shorter times to exacerbation for TIS than MP-376 (HR less than 1.0) except for 
the subgroup with co-infection with S. aureus at baseline plus positive culture in past 12 months, but no 
difference was statistically significant.

The proportion of patients in the ITT population who received systemic and/or inhaled anti-pseudomonal 
antimicrobials and met symptoms requirements over the entire study was 52.4% in the MP-376 group and 
63.4% in the TIS group. The difference in the distribution of the time to administration of antimicrobials and 
meeting symptoms requirements was statistically significant in favour of MP-376 (HR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.53, 
1.01; p = 0.0396), with median times of 141 vs. 110 days. Similar findings applied to the ITT patients who 
received systemic and/or inhaled anti-pseudomonals regardless of symptom requirements. 
The proportion hospitalised due to worsening respiratory status up to the final visit was significantly lower in the 
MP-376 group (17.5% vs. 28.0%, p = 0.0432). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution 
of time to hospitalisation.   
For scores on the Respiratory Domain of the CFQ-R the LS means showed an increase in the MP-376 group and 
a decrease in the TIS group at day 28 with a statistically significant LS mean difference of 3.19 (p = 0.0463). The 
LS mean differences at the end of the other two on-treatment periods (days 84 and 140) were also statistically 
significant in favour of MP-376 as were the LS mean differences at the end of the first two off-treatment periods 
(days 56 and 112). 
Among the 61 treated with MP-376 in MPEX-204 or 207 (26 TIS and 35 MP-376) there were smaller mean 
decreases in sputum P. aeruginosa density at day 28 in both treatment groups compared to the rest of the study 
population. Mean improvements in FEV1 percent predicted and CFQ-R Respiratory Domain scores favoured 
MP-376 regardless of prior exposure to MP-376. 
The study enrolled 28 patients aged from 12-<18 years (9 TIS and 19 MP-376). As shown below, baseline FEV1 
percent predicted was higher in this small number of adolescents compared to the total study population. While 
the absolute and relative changes from baseline were modest they favoured MP-376 numerically. In contrast, 
the changes for FEV1 percent predicted at other study visits (days 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168) consistently 
favoured TIS. Exacerbations occurred in 4 TIS (44%) and 12 MP-376 (63%) patients and the limited data 
suggested a shorter time to exacerbation generally occurred in the MP-376 group. The change in P. aeruginosa 
density (log10 CFU per gram sputum) from baseline to day 28 was greater for the TIS group. However, changes 
in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R favoured MP-376.

Results for MPEX 209 – Extension 
Patients at 45 specified sites who were clinically stable at day 168 could opt to receive 3 cycles of MP-376 in the 
extension. This phase ran from days 168 to 336 counting from star of MPEX-209. However, of the 144 patients 
eligible to participate only 88 enrolled (32 TIS/MP-376 and 56 MP-376/MP-376) of which 15 discontinued before 
day 336. There was a higher proportion aged 12 to 18 years in the Extension Phase (18; 20.5%, of which 4 had 
received TIS and 14 MP-376 initially) vs. the Core Phase (13.6%) and a lower proportion were from the US 
(54.5% vs. 68.8%, respectively). 
At the start of the Extension Phase the FEV1 percent predicted (mean and median) was higher for 
MP-376/MP-376 patients (mean 56.2) compared with TIS/MP-376 patients (mean 50.9). Among the 56 
MP-376/MP-376 patients the effect of treatment was maintained at the end of Cycles 4 and 5 but this was not 
observed for the 45 patients analysed at the end of treatment during Cycle 6. 
Figure 13 
This sub-population of the initial TIS group showed an unexpected pattern in FEV1 percent predicted mean 
change since FEV1 did not fall at day 280. Nevertheless, they maintained a mean relative improvement above 
Core Baseline in each of cycles 4, 5 and 6. Except for FEF25-75, patients who switched from TIS to MP-376 
tended to have greater improvement in PFTs than in the Core Phase. 
Overall, 23 patients who entered the Extension Phase remained exacerbation-free during the entire study. 
Figure 14 
The median time to receiving systemic and/or inhaled antimicrobials and meeting symptom requirements was 
longer (139.5 days) among MP-376/MP-376 patients vs. TIS/MP-376 patients (84 days). The median time to 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 64/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
receiving systemic and/or inhaled antimicrobials regardless of symptoms was also longer for the 
MP-376/MP-376 group (123.5 vs. 77.5 days). During the Extension Phase 16% in each group (9 
MP-376/MP-376 and 5 TIS/MP-376) were hospitalized secondary to a worsening respiratory status.   
At end of treatment time points MP-376/MP-376 patients showed mean improvements in scores for the 
Respiratory Domain of the CFQ-R that were maintained during cycles 4 to 6 (4.63 to 6.07) relative to cycles 1 to 
3 (4.12 to 4.71). TIS/MP-376 patients showed mean improvements at end of treatment in cycle 4 (3.93) but 
values were 2.38 and 0.58 in cycles 5 and 6.

Notes 
1.  Estimates were determined from an ANCOVA model with terms for 
treatment, region (US, non-US), age (12 to 18 years, >18 years), Baseline 
FEV1 (<55%, ≥55%), and Baseline as a covariate. For comparison of FEV1 
percent predicted the Baseline covariate was not included in the model. 
2.  The primary endpoint of non-inferiority of MP-376 relative to TIS for 
relative change from Baseline to Day 28 in FEV1 percent predicted was 
met, based on the lower limit of the LS mean difference (MP-376 minus 
TIS) 95% CI being greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 
-4%. 
3.  Estimates were obtained from a Cox proportional hazards regression 
model including terms for treatment, region (US, non-US), age (12 to 18 
years, >18 years), and Baseline FEV1 (<55%, ≥ 55%). 
4.  P-value was determined using a log-rank test stratified by region (US, 
non-US), age (12 to 18 years, >18 years), and Baseline FEV1 (<55%, 
≥55%).

Analysis performed across trials  
Additional analyses of spirometry data from the Phase 2/3 studies 
Following initial review of the Phase 2/3 studies several issues were raised regarding the mode of analysis, 
including the possibility that the treatment effect could have been over-estimated, and the imputation of data 
points. The applicant conducted several additional analyses to address these concerns. Some of the more 
important findings are discussed below. 
MPEX-204  
The absolute and relative changes from Baseline in FEV1 percent predicted to Day 28 were re-analysed for the 
ITT population using ANCOVA and imputing any missing or excluded data (due to administration of 
anti-pseudomonal agents prior to Day 28) using the least favourable (i.e. worst) treatment mean change and 
least favourable treatment mean percent change, respectively.  ANCOVA was performed in four ways, each 
using a different set of fixed effects and covariates in the model. 
o 
o 
In the original model the difference between MP-376 240 mg BID and Placebo in LS mean absolute change 
was 4.95 in favour of MP-376 240 mg BID, with a corresponding p-value of 0.0009. In the four ANCOVA 
models used in the re-analyses the differences were slightly smaller, ranging from 4.16 (Model 1) to 4.25 
(Model 2) but were still highly statistically significant in favour of MP-376 240 mg BID (p-values ≤ 0.0038). 
In the original model the difference between MP-376 240 mg BID and Placebo in LS mean relative change 
was 10.94 in favour of MP-376 240 mg BID, with a corresponding p-value of 0.0008. In the four ANCOVA 
models used in the re-analyses the differences were numerically smaller, ranging from 9.53 (Model 1) to 
9.81 (Model 2) but were still highly statistically significant in favour of MP-376 240 mg BID (p-values ≤ 
0.0028).  
Thus, the use of ANCOVA instead of MMRM for the statistical models and a more conservative imputation 
method for handling missing or excluded data resulted in lower mean changes from Baseline in both the MP-376 
240 mg BID and Placebo treatment groups.  
MPEX-204, MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 
The absolute and relative changes from Baseline in FEV1 percent predicted to Day 28 were re-analysed for the 
ITT populations with the actual baseline values as a covariate in the statistical models (the original models 
included Baseline FEV1 percent predicted as quartiles in MPEX-204 and as a binary stratification factor [<55% or 
≥55%] in MPEX-207 and MPEX-209). The re-analyses were performed using several statistical models and 
imputation methods. The tables show the results from re-analyses and original analyses for absolute and 
relative changes from Baseline to Day 28.

Replacing the Baseline FEV1 percent predicted values as quartiles or a stratification factor (<55% or ≥55%) with

meaningful impact on the previously estimated differences between MP-376 and the comparator (Placebo or

MPEX-204 and MPEX-207 also had a negligible impact on the results. 
Descriptive statistics from MPEX-204, MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 were presented using the same imputation

Note:  For these analyses, the same imputation method was used in the three studies for consistency.  Missing or excluded 
values at Day 28 (due to use of anti-pseudomonal agents prior to Day 28) were imputed using least favourable treatment 
mean change or percent change from Baseline to Day 28. 
1 Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to first dose of Study Drug. 
2 Day 28 values that corresponded to the absolute change from Baseline to Day 28, which were either observed values or 
imputed values as described in the Note above. 
3 P-value is obtained from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equal distribution between the MP-376 240 mg bid treatment 
groups in each pair of studies.

Based on the descriptive statistics alone, the distribution of the absolute and relative changes from Baseline to 
Day 28 in FEV1 percent predicted among MP-376 patients differed between the MPEX-204 and the later Phase 3 
studies. In MPEX-204 patients were more severely affected at the beginning of the study but mean and median 
improvements in absolute and relative changes from Baseline to Day 28 were greater than in Phase 3. 
Consistent with the descriptive statistics, EDF plots supported the finding of similar distributions between 
MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 and somewhat different distributions between each of these two studies and 
MPEX-204. 
MPEX-207  
The distributions of the absolute and relative changes from Baseline to Day 28 in FEV1 percent predicted in 
MPEX-207 were analysed for the MP-376 and Placebo groups separately. The sample skewness and sample 
kurtosis were calculated. The degree of skewness of the data was higher for MP-376 than for Placebo, but the 
degree was not high in either treatment group. Not surprisingly, given the observed degree of kurtosis, the tests 
for normality were statistically significant. A review of Q-Q plots showed a few outlier values at the lower end 
below the straight line and at the upper end above the straight line, which supported the kurtosis findings.  
The absolute and relative changes from Baseline to Day 28 in FEV1 percent predicted in MPEX-207 were 
compared between MP-376 and Placebo using several nonparametric methods.  
Using nonparametric methods, the estimated differences in median absolute and relative changes between 
MP-376 and Placebo were 1.000 and 1.7860, respectively, with p-values from the nonparametric tests ≤0.0184. 
Although the magnitudes of the estimated differences in the medians were less than the estimated differences 
in the adjusted means, they were still statistically significant in favour of MP-376. Hence, even with some 
evidence of non-normality of the data due to outlier observations, the results from the nonparametric analyses 
support the validity of the previous conclusion drawn from the parametric analyses, namely the superiority of 
MP-376 240 mg BID over Placebo.

Use of additional anti-pseudomonal agents 
Patients in Phase 2/3 studies were categorized into whether they initiated anti-pseudomonal agents before or 
on/after their Day 28 visit, using the date of the Day 28 PFTs. The patients who initiated anti-pseudomonal 
agents before their Day 28 visit were then categorized into whether they permanently discontinued study drug 
prior to their Day 28 visit, permanently discontinued Study Drug early but on/after their Day 28 visit, or did not 
permanently discontinue Study Drug early. 
Percentages that received anti-pseudomonal agents at any time during the studies were: 
  26% for MP-376 240 mg BID vs. 51% for Placebo in MPEX-204;  
  50% for MP-376 240 mg BID vs. 56% for Placebo in MPEX-207; and  
  60% for MP-376 240 mg BID vs. 70% for TIS 300 mg BID in MPEX-209.  
Percentages that received anti-pseudomonal agents prior to the Day 28 visit were low in each study, with the 
highest percentages in MPEX-207 (15% in each treatment group). Nearly all patients who initiated 
anti-pseudomonal agents prior to their Day 28 visit also discontinued Study Drug prior to Day 28. 
o 
o 
o 
In MPEX-204, only 1 patient (3%) in the MP-376 240 mg BID group received anti-pseudomonal agents 
before Day 28 and did not also discontinue Study Drug early.  
In  MPEX-207  4%  in  the  placebo  and  3%  in  the  MP-376  240 mg  BID  group  received  anti-pseudomonal 
agents before Day 28 and did not discontinue Study Drug early.  
In MPEX-209 3% in the MP-376 240 mg BID group vs. 8% in the TIS group received anti-pseudomonal 
agents before Day 28 and did not discontinue Study Drug early. 
For the PFTs and other non-time-to-event efficacy variables, the primary time point of interest for evaluating 
efficacy was Day 28. Re-analyses of the Day 28 FEV1 percent predicted for each the three studies using the same 
imputation method and same statistical model across studies confirmed the previous findings of superiority of 
MP-376 240 mg BID to Placebo and non-inferiority of MP-376 240 mg BID to TIS 300 mg BID (see above).   
However, 156/409 (38%) of patients who received 240 mg BID in Phase 2/3 studies were reported to have 
received a systemic fluoroquinolone concomitantly. The applicant provided a table (below) showing 42 patients 
assigned to 240 mg BID who received a systemic fluoroquinolone during dosing. On further review it was 
clarified that only 9/36 in MPEX-209 were confirmed to have received a systemic fluoroquinolone during an 
on-treatment period.

Note: For MPEX-209, On-treatment is defined as Cycle Day 1 through Cycle Day 28 and Off-treatment is 
defined as Cycle Day >28, but prior to start day of next cycle. 
Note: Subjects are counted only once within each column (i.e., within each study and dose level). If more 
than one defined category applies, the subject is assigned to the first category listed. 
Note: There were patients who received MP-376 in two studies and received fluoroquinolone during both 
studies (4 patients in both MPEX-207 and MPEX-209). These patients were counted once under each 
study and the corresponding category of fluoroquinolone use for that study. 
Note:  *  For  MPEX-209  it  was  further  clarified  that  only  9  out  of  36  subjects  received  systemic 
fluoroquinolones during on-treatment period 
Magnitude of effect on FEV1 across the studies 
Mean baseline FEV1 percent predicted values were generally similar across the three Phase 2/3 studies. The 
magnitude of the mean improvement was greatest in MPEX-204 and least in MPEX-209, as shown below (note 
that different models were used to derive the estimates). The real outlier is the Phase 2 study MPEX-204, which 
was conducted 2 or more years earlier (see the discussions above on this point).  
The response to placebo differed between studies, with a drop from baseline in MPEX-204 and an increase in 
MPEX-207. The applicant proposed that this could reflect changes in attitudes to placebo-controlled studies 
between MPEX-204 (fully enrolled by 1Q2009) and MPEX-207 (enrolled 4Q2010-1Q2012). The initiation of trials 
with Ivacaftor in 2009 and subsequent approvals of Cayston, TOBI Podhaler and Colobreathe could have 
influenced the composition of the patient population willing to enter a placebo-controlled study.  
Thus, patients least dependent on cycled antimicrobials for maintenance of lung function and less responsive to 
introduction of a new antimicrobial may have been those most likely to enrol.

This hypothesis is somewhat supported by the corresponding observation that the categorical changes in FEV1 
percent predicted showed that patients in the later studies MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 were much less likely to 
have a significant improvement (at least 10%) than those in MPEX-204, even though the overall categorical 
differences vs. placebo and vs. TIS were statistically significant.

Clinical isolates from the MP-376 studies 
  Across MPEX-204, MPEX-207 and MPEX-209 MICs of levofloxacin for P. aeruginosa baseline isolates from 
648 patients gave MIC50 and MIC90 values 4 and 16 µg/mL, respectively, suggesting substantial prior 
exposure to fluoroquinolones. Nearly 40% of isolates were classed as MDR. 
 
Isolates (209) from MPEX-209 underwent phenotypic detection of hyper-expression of efflux pumps and 
sequencing of the DNA topoisomerases was performed. Only 10.5% and 29.7% of these isolates were 
inhibited at ≤ 1 μg/mL and ≤ 2 μg/mL levofloxacin, respectively. MIC50/90 values were ≤ 0.06/1 or ≤ 
0.06/0.5 when determined with 40 μg/mL and 80 μg/mL, respectively, of the pump inhibitor PaβN and all 
except 2-3 had MICs < 4 μg/mL. Also, 120/209 displayed amino acid alterations at the QRDR of GyrA and/or 
ParC and 25 isolates had multiple amino acid substitutions. 
  At baseline, 30.3% of P. aeruginosa isolated from patients randomised to MP-376 240 mg BID had 
levofloxacin MICs ≤ 1 µg/mL. Following 28 days of treatment, 22.0% of isolates had MICs ≤ 1 µg/mL, 
increasing to 27.8% after 28 days off treatment.  
 
The highest MIC observed per patient had increased > 2-fold by day 28 for 16.4% of placebo patients and 
17.8% of MP-376 patients (p = 0.7736). Rates at day 56 (after 28 days off treatment) were 17.4% and 
17.9%, respectively. 
 
Treatment with MP-376 240 mg BID for 3 cycles in MPEX-209 did not dramatically change the observations. 
Among the 56 patients who received MP-376 240 mg BID for up to 6 consecutive cycles the levofloxacin 
MICs did not shift substantially (MICs ≤ 1 µg/mL were observed for 22.2% at baseline and 21.2% on day 
336). 
 
In the ITT populations of MPEX-204, 207 and 209 mean baseline sputum P. aeruginosa densities ranged 
from 7.15 to 7.72 log10 CFU/gram but individual patient sputum densities ranged from 1.60 to 9.26 log10 
CFU/g. In all three studies the sputum density of P. aeruginosa decreased during MP-376 treatment and 
then recovered to around baseline numbers by the end of the off-treatment period.  
 
The magnitude of change in sputum P. aeruginosa sputum density from baseline to day 28 in an individual 
patient was a poor predictor of that patient’s clinical response as measured by relative or absolute change 
from baseline to day 28 in FEV1 percent predicted or RD of the CFQ-R.  
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 77/106 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the relative and absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted there were significant non-zero correlations 
between sputum density and FEV1 change from baseline to day 28 by LS linear regression (p = 0.0159 and 
p = 0.0207) but the R-squared values (0.0088 and 0.0081) indicated that less than 1% of the observed 
variability in FEV1 response could be accounted for by change in P. aeruginosa sputum density.  
 
The baseline highest levofloxacin MIC isolate per patient was associated with change in sputum P. 
aeruginosa density at day 28 among MP-376 240 mg BID patients, with lower MICs associated with greater 
observed reduction in sputum density (p = 0.0027).  However, less than 3% of the variability in sputum P. 
aeruginosa density change in the population could be explained by differences in baseline levofloxacin MICs 
of the highest levofloxacin isolate (R-squared = 0.0234). 
 
The baseline levofloxacin MIC was not predictive of relative or absolute change in FEV1 after 28 days of 
MP-376 240 mg BID, change in CFQ-R Respiratory Symptom Score or time to pulmonary exacerbation. 
Similarly, mean change from baseline to Day 28 in efficacy outcomes was similar among patients treated 
with MP-376 240 mg BID regardless of the presence or absence of a baseline MDR P. aeruginosa.  
  Among 688 patients from the Phase 2/3 studies who received MP-376 240 mg BID) 651 (97.0%) had P. 
aeruginosa isolated at baseline and 388 (57.8%) had at least one other opportunist pathogen. S. aureus was 
found in 334 patients (49.8%) including 145 (21.6%) MRSA. S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans and B. cepacia 
complex strains were much less common (in 9.4%, 5.5% and 1.2% of patients, respectively).  
 
Treatment with MP-376 240 mg BID was not associated with a change in the prevalence of CF bacterial 
opportunists over 3 or 6 treatment cycles in MPEX-209.  
 
The magnitude of mean FEV1 increase at Day 28 among all MP-376-treated patients with baseline S. aureus 
in Phase 2/3 studies was lower vs. those without S. aureus. Treatment-associated changes in FEV1 favoured 
MP-376-treated patients over placebo regardless of whether S. aureus was present at baseline (with: 
1.89 % predicted; without 1.22 % predicted; the 95% confidence intervals for both point estimates included 
zero).  Among patients who received 28 Days MP-376 240 mg BID the 332 patients not co-infected with 
MRSA had a greater mean increase in FEV1 than 100 with MRSA (1.66 vs. 0.39 % predicted).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
General observations 
The clinical development programme for MP-376 occurred during a period of change in terms of clinical practice. 
For example: 
o 
It  is  now  common  practise  to  rotate  inhaled  antibacterial  agents  by  cycle  so  that  studies  that  require 
administration of repeated cycles of the same agent/product are unlikely to be feasible. 
o  The age at which onset of chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa occurs has generally increased. This has 
impacted on recruitment, with particular problems enrolling younger patients. 
o  Very few patients can be enrolled who are naïve to one or more licensed inhaled antibacterial agents. 
Reflecting these changes, MPEX-207 vs. placebo covered only one treatment cycle. MPEX-209 vs. TIS covered 
3 cycles but a relatively small proportion of patients elected to enrol in the extension phase. 
Prior use of inhaled antibacterial agents 
The two studies that first described the effects of inhaled tobramycin vs. placebo (Ramsey et al., NEJM 1999; 
340; 23-30) are generally regarded as having been conducted in patients not previously treated with the drug 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 78/106 
 
  
  
  
by this route. The early sharp improvement in FEV1% predicted in the tobramycin group was followed by 
improvements of lesser magnitude in the sequential cycles although superiority vs. placebo was demonstrated 
at week 20 (end of treatment cycle 3).  
The listings of prior inhaled antibacterial agents in MPEX-207 and 209 indicate no prior use of inhaled 
fluoroquinolones, although the MICs observed for P. aeruginosa at baseline strongly suggest some had prior 
systemic exposure to this class. Based on observations with tobramycin, it cannot be dismissed that a first 
exposure to inhaled levofloxacin in MPEX-207 and 209 could result in an initial magnitude of effect on FEV1 (i.e. 
at day 28) that wanes to some extent with longer-term use.  
In MPEX-207 vs. placebo and in MPEX-209 vs. TIS eligible patients must have received at least three 28-day 
courses (or total 84 days) of an inhaled antimicrobial in the prior 12 months. In MPEX-209 these criteria were to 
be met for prior tobramycin usage in all patients. Nevertheless, even in MPEX-207, the vast majority of patients 
had received multiple courses of TIS within the last year, with lesser use of aztreonam and colistin. Prior 
exposure to tobramycin would be expected to reduce withdrawals due to lack of tolerance/TEAEs but experience 
indicates that the treatment effect based on change in FEV1 would not be expected to be comparable with that 
in naïve patients. 
Hence it cannot be dismissed that a comparison of change in FEV1 from baseline to day 28 between the first 
levofloxacin cycle in naïve patients vs. a cycle of TIS in tobramycin-experienced patients could be biased in 
favour of levofloxacin. Due to these considerations, it is critical to view the results of both studies, but especially 
the comparisons made with TIS in MPEX-209, with an appreciation of the possible effects of naivety to inhaled 
levofloxacin on the FEV1 results (see further below regarding the results). 
Despite these concerns it is very important to note that in the Phase 3 study that compared Cayston vs. TIS the 
inclusion criteria required that patients must have received ≥ 84 days (3 courses) of inhaled tobramycin in the 
previous 12 months. Similarly, in the Phase 3 study of Colobreathe vs. TIS all patients were to have received at 
least 2 cycles of TIS immediately prior to randomisation. Therefore the approach taken in MPEX-209 was in 
keeping with prior pivotal Phase 3 studies that used TIS as the comparator. 
Exacerbations 
The definition of an exacerbation differed between MPEX-207 and MPEX-209. In line with advice received from 
FDA, both studies required that patients met 4/12 Fuchs criteria, died or received an anti-pseudomonal agent for 
an event determined to be an exacerbation by the BEAC. The RSSQ was used to collect signs and symptoms of 
an exacerbation in both studies. In MPEX-207, but not in MPEX-209, early discontinuation from the study was 
also counted as an exacerbation. Hence a clinical decision to treat with an anti-pseudomonal agent was not 
counted as an exacerbation unless other criteria were met and not all events counted as exacerbations were 
accompanied by initiation of anti-pseudomonal treatment. 
These features explain why rates for anti-pseudomonal drug use do not match the exacerbation rates. In 
addition, due to the rules described above, initiation of an anti-pseudomonal drug did not always result in 
permanent study drug discontinuation and it was not a reason to discontinue from study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding study MPEX-204 
The doses tested in MPEX-204 were selected from the Phase 1 safety data at doses from 78 mg QD up to 260 mg 
BID (early formulations) and from the studies that used the 100 mg/mL formulation (MPEX-203 and 205). 
Plasma exposures to levofloxacin at the lowest dose used in MPEX-204 (120 mg QD) were expected to be 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 79/106 
 
  
  
  
associated with concentrations in pulmonary tissues in excess of those required for bactericidal activity against 
CF pathogens.  
Use of a microbiological primary endpoint allowed elimination of any dose that had no discernible effect on 
organism numbers. Based on P. aeruginosa cfu/g, the on-treatment and end of treatment data for the EE 
population suggested that 240 mg BID had the greatest effect, although it achieved only a 1-log decrease vs. 
placebo from the high baseline load.  
A single cycle comparison against placebo in this patient population is acceptable. Even in this single cycle study 
with follow-up to day 56 18-27% in the MP-376 groups and 49% in the placebo group required additional 
anti-pseudomonal therapy. The median time to use of such agents could not be calculated but the 25th percentile 
was 31 days for placebo vs. 59 days for 240 mg BID in the MITT population. Exacerbations were not defined and 
hence time to exacerbation was not determined but it is reasonable to assume that additional anti-pseudomonal 
agents were given to those with some worsening in condition even though it is not known if they met the Phase 
3 study exacerbation criteria. 
As reported, the PFT data from this study showed that all three MP-376 regimens provided numerical 
improvements vs. placebo for several parameters. While it should be noted that the range of change from 
baseline in placebo and MP-376 groups was very wide, the comparisons of mean percent change in FEV1 and in 
mean relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 showed that only the 240 mg BID 
regimen was superior to placebo. The 240 mg BID group also had a significantly higher proportion with ≥ 10% 
change in actual FEV1 from baseline to day 28. Overall these data broadly supported evaluation of 240 mg BID 
in Phase 3.  
MPEX-207 vs. placebo 
As for MPEX-204, a single cycle study is all that can be expected when a placebo control group is used. Almost 
all patients (>95%) completed the final (day 56) visit in this single cycle study. During the entire 56-day study 
122/220 (55.5%) MP-376 and 52/110 (47.3%) placebo patients experienced a pulmonary exacerbation in 
accordance with the protocol criteria. The primary analysis failed to show superiority for MP-376 vs. placebo for 
time to exacerbation and there was a non-significant (but nearly significant; p=0.0715) trend in favour of 
placebo.  
Overall study population rates for exacerbations that met 4/12 Fuchs criteria were 44/110 (40%) for placebo 
and 105/220 (47.7%) for MP-376. In another 8 (7.3%) placebo and 12 (5.5%) MP-376 patients the 
“exacerbation” was based on a BEAC-determined event. There were 5 (2.3%) in the MP-376 group counted as 
having an “exacerbation” due to study discontinuation but the sensitivity analyses showed that excluding these 
patients gave exacerbation rates that still favoured placebo numerically (52/110 [47.3%[ for placebo vs. 
117/220 [53.2%] for MP-376; HR 1.17 [0.84, 1.63].  
The table of sensitivity analyses shows that the rate of non-study anti-pseudomonal use for any reason 
throughout the 56 days was similar between groups (62.7% in the placebo group and 64.1% in the MP-376 
group; HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.79, 1.42]). Reflecting the relatively low exacerbation rates and use of additional 
antibacterial agents while still on study treatment (i.e. up to day 28) the calculated median time to exacerbation 
was 51.5 days in the MP-376 group and 58 days in the placebo group (not statistically significant).  
The fact that most exacerbations had onset after completion of treatment in both the active and placebo groups, 
with no significant difference in time to exacerbation, is unexpected. The applicant pointed out that the mean 
number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring treatment with antimicrobials in the last 12 months pre-study was 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 80/106 
 
  
  
  
2.0 for MP-376 and 1.6 for placebo while 34% vs. 20% in respective groups had ≥ 3 exacerbations. However, 
the HR for time to exacerbation favoured placebo for those with >5 exacerbations in the prior 12 months. 
It was notable that 15% MP-376 and 25.5% placebo patients received an anti-pseudomonal agent but did not 
meet the modified Fuchs criteria for an exacerbation within the time window set. The applicant points out that 
there was likely some inadvertent unblinding of treatment assignment due to the bitter taste of MP-376, which 
may have resulted in a lower threshold for starting non-study anti-pseudomonal agents in patients thought 
likely (by patients themselves and/or investigators) to be on placebo. If this hypothesis is correct, then it may 
explain why the proportion of ITT patients who received systemic and/or inhaled anti-pseudomonal 
antimicrobials and met symptom requirements (at least 1 of 4 worsening respiratory symptoms) was 45.5% for 
MP-376 and 50.9% for placebo. However, there was no difference in the median time to administration of 
systemic and/or inhaled anti-pseudomonal antimicrobials for patients who met symptom requirements (59 days 
vs. 58 days). 
Overall, there is no clear explanation for the observations made above. Nevertheless, despite failing to show a 
benefit for MP-376 vs. placebo for the primary endpoint of time to exacerbation, the applicant considers that this 
study did show a benefit for effects on PFTs, which would not have been influenced by possible knowledge of 
treatment assignment.  
At baseline the mean FEV1 was 2.05 L in both groups and mean FEV1 percent predicted values were 56.3 for 
placebo and 56.6 for the MP-376 240 mg BID group but with a wide and similar range in each group. MP-376 was 
stated to be superior to placebo for absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 (mean 
-0.18 for placebo and 1.15 for MP-376; p=0.0137). The sensitivity and subgroup analyses also contrasted 
completely with those for the primary endpoint in almost consistently favouring MP-376. 
The CSR reports statistically significant between-group differences in the ITT population favouring MP-376 for 
several other PFT parameters including (among others) the relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from 
baseline to day 28 (LS mean 1.24 for placebo vs. 3.66 for MP-376; LS mean difference 2.42; p=0.01) and 
percent change in FEV1 and FVC during treatment. Analyses using different imputation methods seemed to 
support the findings.  
MPEX-209 vs. TIS 
The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was agreed with CHMP and was the same as that used for the Phase 3 
study for aztreonam vs. TIS that had the same primary endpoint at day 28. The primary analysis of MPEX-209 
demonstrated non-inferiority with respect to relative change from baseline to day 28 for FEV1 percent predicted 
with a lower bound of the 95% CI (-0.66 ITT; -0.25% EE) that was well within the pre-defined margin. However, 
the test for superiority failed to show significance (ITT p=0.148). 
In the ITT and EE populations the relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline consistently favoured 
MP-376 (numerically, but not significantly) at the end of each on-treatment period but there was no difference 
at the end of each off-treatment period. The data did not suggest early waning of treatment effect for MP-376 
but it was very striking that TIS achieved very little relative change from baseline in these heavily pre-treated 
patients. Nevertheless, the results for TIS in MPEX-209 are consistent with those of the Phase 3 study that 
compared TIS with inhaled aztreonam in which TIS had a minimal or no effect on FEV1 percent predicted during 
3 cycles. In contrast, in the smaller sub-group enrolled before protocol amendment who were tobramycin-naïve 
or less experienced (<84 days in prior 12 months) the change in FEV1 favoured TIS over aztreonam.  
The study showed that the actual changes in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 were modest but 
were at least as good and numerically better for MP-376.  
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 81/106 
 
  
  
  
In this study the baseline FEV1 percent predicted values were very similar to those reported in MPEX-207. It is 
of interest to note that the LS mean difference in relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 
28 for MP-376 vs. placebo in MPEX-207 was 2.42 whereas the corresponding difference vs. TIS in MPEX-209 was 
1.86 (although note that different models were used to derive these estimates). It is also notable that although 
MPEX-207 failed its primary endpoint and showed a trend that favoured placebo for time to exacerbation, 
MPEX-209 showed a trend in favour of MP-376 over TIS for time to exacerbation although the difference was not 
significant.  
In conclusion, as reported, MPEX-209 showed a very consistent numerical but not a statistically superior benefit 
for MP-376 over TIS in a patient population that can be described as heavily pre-treated with tobramycin. At the 
time the study was conducted, a comparison with a tobramycin-naïve population would not have been a feasible 
undertaking. Therefore, although the results that would have been observed if the two treatments had been 
compared in a population that was either naïve or experienced in inhalational use of both agents would likely 
have been very different, the study (subject to clarification of some issues as noted above) points to the likely 
utility of inhaled MP-376 when used in a cyclical regimen that alternates between antibacterial agents in 
accordance with current routine practise. 
Response to MP-376 over 6 cycles 
In an era in which many centres switch antibacterial agents with each cycle it was not surprising that relatively 
few patients elected to enter the extension of MPEX-209. Since this was non-comparative and since there was 
a baseline imbalance between those who had received TIS or MP-376 in the core phase, it is difficult to interpret 
the findings. However: 
 
Those who received TIS had a very good response to the first and slightly lesser response to the subsequent 
cycles of MP-376 based on FEV1 percent predicted. This finding supports the cyclical use of tobramycin and 
levofloxacin.  
 
Those already treated with MP-376 continued to respond in cycles 4 and 5 but strangely did not respond to 
cycle 6. In such small numbers, and taking into account the quite different pattern in cycles 4 and 5, it is 
difficult to put too much weight on this observation. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
In MPEX-207 there were 46 patients aged 12 to < 18 years. Exacerbation-free survival rates at day 56 were 
16/30 (53.3%) for MP-376 and 4/16 (25%) for placebo. The HR was 0.51 (95% CI 0.22, 1.15), and the p-value 
from the log-rank test was 0.0693. Hence, this post hoc analysis suggested a benefit for MP-376 vs. placebo. 
The baseline FEV1 percent predicted in this age sub-group was higher than for the overall population (62.8 for 
placebo and 63.5 for MP-376). The PFT results were consistent with the apparent benefit in terms of 
exacerbations.  
MPEX-209 enrolled only 28 patients aged from 12-<18 years (9 TIS and 19 MP-376). Baseline FEV1 percent 
predicted values in these adolescents were greater than for the total study population. As in adults the absolute 
and relative changes in FEV1 from baseline to day 28 were modest but they favoured MP-376 numerically. For 
absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to day 28 the LSM treatment difference was 1.27 (95% 
CI -4.51, 7.06; p-value 0.6538) with similar findings for relative change. In this very small population the results 
for other endpoints did not favour MP-376.  
Predicted sputum concentrations of MP-376 at steady state were lower for adolescents vs. adults but the 
available data suggest that MP-376 can elicit improvements in FEV1 in patients aged 12-<18 years. However, 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 82/106 
 
  
  
  
the predicted serum concentrations are of major concern and there are no adequate safety data to cover the use 
of repeated 28-day cycles of Quinsair that give ~50% of the systemic exposure observed with oral and IV 
dosing. Currently use cannot be recommended for subjects aged < 18 years. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded on the following: 
  As analysed and reported in the CSRs, the effect of MP-376 on the absolute and relative change in FEV1 
percent predicted from baseline to day 28 was shown to be better than placebo in two studies.  
 
The CSR for study 209 reported an effect of MP-376 on FEV1 that was modest but at least as good (and 
numerically better) than that of TIS over 1-3 cycles in a population that was pre-treated with inhaled 
tobramycin.  
  As in other recent application dossiers for inhaled antibacterial agents in CF patients chronically colonised 
with P. aeruginosa it is not possible to gauge how inhaled levofloxacin would have compared with TOBI in a 
population that was non-naïve to both treatments.  
  As analysed, this study showed non-inferiority for MP-376 vs. TOBI but it did not attain superiority, which 
would have allayed the concern regarding the limited value of showing non-inferiority against an agent that 
no longer achieves a discernible effect on FEV1.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Oversight of safety for MPEX-207 and 209 was conducted by a sub-committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Therapeutics DSMB.  
Patient exposure 
The clinical safety database comprised 1085 unique subjects. In CF studies 417 unique subjects were initially 
assigned to 240 mg BID and another 32 initially assigned to TIS received this dose in the extension phase. 
Counting numbers by study (i.e. those who entered more than one study are counted twice) and removing those 
who were randomised but not treated there were 39 in MPEX-204, 219 in MPEX-207, 182 in the core phase of 
MPEX-209 and the additional 32 who entered the extension, which results in a count of 472.

The number inside parentheses corresponds to patients in the cell total already counted in the same column by 
virtue of having participated in a previous study.   
The mean number of days exposed to 240 mg BID in the single cycle CF studies was 25.6 and 214/257 subjects 
received at least 80% of assigned treatment (i.e. 28 days). In the 3-cycle study MPEX-209 the mean number of 
days on treatment with 240 mg BID was 69 and 123/182 received at least 80% of the assigned therapy (i.e. 84 
days).   
Adverse events 
In the All Efficacy and Safety Studies in CF group, 97.1% who received MP-376 240 mg BID had at least one 
TEAE and 48.2% had a treatment-related TEAE, mainly driven by rates of dysgeusia. Overall 10% of patients 
experienced one or more severe TEAEs. In the Placebo-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group 95.3% receiving 
MP-376 240 mg BID and 92.5% on placebo had at least one TEAE. The rate for treatment-related TEAEs was 
higher with MP-376 (49.8% vs. 18.5% for placebo), mainly due to dysgeusia, but the incidence of severe TEAEs 
was similar (8.6% and 6.8%, respectively).  
In the Active-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group 98.9% in each of the MP-376 and TIS groups experienced one 
or more TEAEs but the rate for treatment-related TEAEs was higher with MP-376 (44.5% vs. 15.6%), mainly due 
to dysgeusia, while the rate of severe TEAEs was lower with MP-376 (11.5% vs. 18.9%). 
In a retrospective analysis there was no clear correlation identified between systemic exposures (using the 
refined POPPK model) and specific AEs including haemoptysis, dysgeusia or headache.

In the All Efficacy and Safety Studies in CF the most common TEAEs (excluding disease progression) reported for 
MP-376 were cough, sputum increased, dysgeusia and respiratory tract congestion. Cough was also the most 
common TEAE with onset during treatment with MP-376 240 mg BID (36.2%) followed by dysgeusia (31.1%). 
Few severe TEAEs were reported for MP-376 but the commonest was dysgeusia (1.5%).

In the Placebo-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group many TEAEs occurred at similar rates in the MP-376 240 mg 
BID and placebo groups. Exceptions included rates for cough, dysgeusia, sputum increased and pyrexia. TEAEs 
with an incidence of at least 5% of patients in the 240 mg BID group and at least one percentage point greater 
than in the placebo group are shown in the next table.

The imbalance in rates of pyrexia (7.8% MP-376 240 mg BID vs. 2.7% placebo) was not associated with a 
difference in rates of infections and infestations (18.3% MP-376 and 21.9% Placebo) and could not be linked to 
incidences of neutropenia or UTI.   
In the Active-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group some common TEAEs were reported more frequently in the 
MP-376 vs. TIS group, including dysgeusia (25.3% vs. 0%), sputum increased (51.1% vs. 44.4%), cough 
(57.7% vs. 52.2%) and paranasal sinus hypersecretion (26.9% vs. 20.0%). These same TEAEs were reported 
more frequently during treatment with MP-376 vs. TIS. Decreased weight, decreased FEV and exertional 
dyspnoea were reported more frequently in the TIS group. There was no difference in the rates of pyrexia 
between MP-376 and TIS (9.3% vs. 8.9%).  
In the Extension Phase of MPEX-209 there were no findings contrary to those in the controlled studies. The most 
common TEAEs were cough (71.4%), sputum increased (60.7%), weight decreased (53.6%) and respiratory 
tract congestion (51.8%). Most of these TEAEs were reported to have onset during treatment. In these patients 
dysgeusia was reported in 17.9% but it was the most common TEAE considered treatment-related. A further 
analysis of TEAE rates by cycle in the subjects who received MP-376 throughout did not show a consistent trend 
to increases or decreases in rates as the number of cycles increased.  
Bronchodilator use to control immediate bronchospasm 
o 
In the Placebo-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group, mean changes in FEV1 were similar for MP-376 240 mg 
BID and Placebo (-0.056 L and -0.066 L, respectively). 
In the Active-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group, MP-376 and TIS showed similar changes from pre-dose 
to post-dose on Day 1 (-0.051 L and -0.063 L, respectively).  
o 
o  A very small number of patients reported 20% or more decrease in FEV1 pre to post MP-376 dose on Day 
1 (1 patient in MPEX-209 and 1 patient in MPEX-204 but none in MPEX-207). 
Protocols recommended that patients who experienced a ≥15% relative decrease in FEV1 after dosing at Visit 1 
administer a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator before Study Drug administration for all future doses. Numbers 
requiring a bronchodilator to prevent or alleviate potential symptoms related to Study Drug dosing during the 
study were: 
o 
o 
1 patient (0.5%) on MP-376 and 1 (1.1%) on TIS in MPEX-209 
7 (3.2%) MP-376 and 4 (3.6%) placebo in MPEX-207 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 87/106 
 
  
  
  
 
Information is not available for MPEX-204 but 2 patients (5.4%) in the MP-376 240 mg QD group had FEV1 
decreases of at least 15% on Day 1. 
Disease Progression  
Pulmonary exacerbation was an efficacy endpoint in MPEX-207 and MPEX-209. Disease progression is the PT for 
pulmonary exacerbation but not all TEAEs with this PT were necessarily considered pulmonary exacerbations in 
the analyses of efficacy. 
In the All Efficacy and Safety Studies in CF disease progression was reported as a TEAE for 47.2% who received 
MP-376 240 mg BID (severe in 3.4%; 21.8% with onset during a treatment period). Disease progression was 
the most common SAE and was one of the most common TEAEs leading to study discontinuation (see below). 
However, disease progression was reported as a TEAE for similar proportions in the MP-376 240 mg BID and 
placebo groups (38.1% vs. 36.3% during the entire study and 14.0% vs. 17.1% during treatment). Also, 
disease progression was reported as a TEAE for a lower proportion in the MP-376 240 mg BID group vs. the TIS 
group (56.0% vs. 63.3% during the entire study 30.2% vs. 44.4% during treatment). 
Fluoroquinolone Class Effects of Interest in CF patients 
Thirteen patients (3.2%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID experienced TEAEs of potential hepatotoxicity and 
in 5/13 (1.2%) the events were considered related to treatment.  The PTs in the MP-376 group were ALT and 
AST increased (each in 6 patients), hepatic enzyme increased (2 patients) and single patients with cytolytic 
hepatitis, hepatic enzyme abnormal, hyperbilirubinaemia and liver function test abnormal. Two cases of 
elevated AST were considered severe but not serious in the MP-376 group. There were 3 placebo patients 
(2.1%) with a potential TEAE of hepatotoxicity. The PTs in the placebo group were ALT increased (2) and 
hepatomegaly (1).  
Severe cases with transaminase increases in the MP-376 BID group included: 
  A 27-year-old female with normal AST, ALT and ALP at screening that increased to AST 230 U/L, 641 U/L 
ALT and 311 U/L ALP at day 28 that had decreased to near normal 2 weeks later. There was no change in 
bilirubin. 
  A 32-year-old male with normal screening values had ALT and AST increased from Day 29 of Cycle 2. At the 
end of Cycle 2 (day 84), values of 240 U/L and 142 U/L. However, by the start of Cycle 3 (day 112) values 
were normal and did not increase with treatment.  
The case of cytolytic hepatitis with 240 mg BID involved a 24-year-old male with onset from Day 84 (end of 
treatment in Cycle 2) and lasting to Day 92. Only AST was increased (117 U/L) but a week later it had reduced 
to 35 U/L. There was no elevation of AST in the third treatment cycle. 
Musculoskeletal TEAEs occurred in 23 patients (5.6%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID, including 10 (2.4%) 
with TEAEs considered related to treatment. One SAE of costochondritis and two cases of moderate tendonitis 
led to discontinuation of MP-376 240 mg BID and one other patient in the MP-376 QD group experienced 
costochondritis.  
In the placebo group 5 patients (3.4%) had musculoskeletal TEAEs including two considered treatment-related 
(1.4%) and one deemed to be severe. Six TIS patients (6.7%) experienced musculoskeletal TEAEs but none was 
considered treatment-related or severe. 
Dysglycaemia was reported in 22 patients (5.4%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID. None was considered 
related to treatment, 4 were considered severe (all hyperglycaemia) but none was serious or led to 
discontinuation of MP-376. There were 7 (4.8%) in the placebo group with dysglycaemia TEAEs and 9 (10.0%) 
in the TIS group. Many of these TEAEs (hyper and hypoglycaemia) occurred in patients with a history of 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 88/106 
 
  
  
  
One patient (0.2%) treated with MP-376 240 mg BID experienced severe acute renal failure (SAE) but it was not 
considered related to treatment and did not lead to discontinuation of MP-376. This occurred in a 30-year-old 
female from day 43 to day 50 with creatinine 4.86 mg/dL and urea 84 mg/dL. Dehydration and ibuprofen use 
were deemed the most likely cause. No cases were reported with placebo or TIS.  
Six patients (1.5%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID had cytopenias reported as TEAEs but none was 
considered related to treatment, severe, serious or led to discontinuation of MP-376. Most of these cases 
involved WBC abnormalities only. 
One patient (0.2%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID and one who received QD treatment had TEAEs of 
peripheral neuropathy considered treatment-related by the investigator. One mild case had onset on Day 26 and 
resolved after 5 days and one mild case with onset on day 4 resolved after 4 days.  
In the COPD studies 89.1% MP-376 and 84.7% placebo patients had at least one TEAE and 40.4% and 28.8%, 
respectively, had a treatment-related TEAE. Severe TEAES occurred in 30.0% MP-376 and 23.4% placebo 
patients. The most common TEAE was acute exacerbation or COPD worsening (46.5% MP-376 and 45.9% 
placebo). Dysgeusia was reported by 29.6% vs. 2.7%, respectively, but rates for other TEAEs were either 
similar or showed much smaller differences between MP-376 and placebo. 
Four patients (1.8%) in the MP-376 240 mg BID group experienced TEAEs of potential hepatotoxicity (PTs were 
LFT abnormal in 2 patients, hepatic enzyme increased and hepatic steatosis). One case of LFT abnormal was 
severe but the findings were probably due to alcohol and hepatitis C.

 
 
In MPEX-204 the MP-376 case was face swelling associated with tooth pain.  
In MPEX-207 10 patients, all MP-376, had TEAEs of rash or possible hypersensitivity reactions (5 rashes, 2 
urticaria, 1 erythema, 1 stomatitis and 1 rhinosinusitis.  
 
In MPEX-209 Core Phase there were 8 cases in the TIS and 11 in the MP-376 group. Ten of the 11 MP-376 
patients had rashes and one had a drug eruption. All except one was not related or unlikely to be related, 
mild and resolved despite continuation of study drug. The exceptional patient had 2 TEAEs during the second 
“Off” cycle (Red Man Syndrome and rash) but these commenced just after starting clindamycin, vancomycin 
and ceftazidime for suspected sinusitis. 
 
In MPEX-209 EXT 9 patients had rash or potential hypersensitivity of which 5 had received MP-376 in the 
Core Phase without such AEs. The 4 from the TIS group had rash, erythema, multiple allergies and eczema. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in MP-376 groups in clinical studies.  
 
In the CF studies SAEs were reported for 58 patients (14.2%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID and 4 
treated with other doses. Other than disease progression the only SAE reported by more than 1 patient was 
bronchopneumonia (in 3 treated with MP-376 240 mg BID).  
 
In the Placebo-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group SAEs were reported for 21 patients (8.2%) who 
received MP-376 240 mg BID, 5 (6.7%) treated with other doses and 14 (9.6%) placebo patients. No SAE 
(excluding disease progression) was reported by > 1 patient in any treatment group. 
 
In the Active-Controlled Efficacy and Safety group treated for up to 3 cycles SAEs were reported for 38 
patients (20.9%) receiving MP-376 and 25 (27.8%) receiving TIS. The only SAE (other than disease 
progression) reported by more than 1 patient was bronchopneumonia (2 patients in each treatment group).  
 
In the Extension Phase of MPEX-209 37.5% had at least one SAE across the phases but no SAE (except 
disease progression) was reported by > 1 patient. 
 
Four patients receiving MP-376 experienced SAEs during the clinical pharmacology studies including one 
patient with moderate severity constipation and three with disease progression.

In the COPD studies SAEs were reported by 29.6% who received MP-376 (68 patients) and 27.9% treated with 
placebo (31 patients). Acute exacerbation or worsening of disease was the most common SAE (in 14.3% and 
18.9%, respectively. Other SAEs reported by more than 1% were pneumonia (3.5% vs. 0.9%), chest pain 
(1.3% vs. 2.7%), coronary artery disease (1.7% vs. 0%) and respiratory failure (0.9% vs. 1.8%). 
Laboratory findings 
Mean changes and shifts from baseline in haematology and chemistry parameters were not remarkably different 
between MP-376 and either placebo or TIS groups. A higher proportion of patients shifted from normal to high 
values for platelets at endpoint in the MP-376 vs. TIS group (9.1% vs. 4.4%, respectively) but at day 28 the 
results were similar. Overall, 19.8% treated with MP-376 240 mg BID had at least one potentially clinically 
significant (PCS) haematology value. Most were related to neutrophils (16.4%). Rates were not higher vs. 
placebo and TIS.

Overall, 26.9% MP-376 240 mg BID patients had at least one PCS chemistry value, mostly involving glucose 
(13.4%) and ALP (8.1%). There were 22.2% in the MP-376 240 mg BID group and 28.6% in the placebo group 
who experienced at least one PCS serum chemistry value; AST PCS values were reported more frequently for 
MP-376 vs. placebo (1.6% vs. 0%). Also, 33.3% MP-376 240 mg BID and 36.7% TIS patients had at least one

In the MP-376 240 mg BID group 5 patients (1.2%) had ALT ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and in one patient 
(0.2%) ALT was ≥ 10 x ULN. However, the proportion with ALT ≥ 3 x ULN was lower for MP-376 240 mg BID vs. 
placebo (0.8% vs. 2.7%) while proportions were similar between MP-376 and TIS (1.7% and 1.1%).  
Overall, 5 (2.3%) of patients treated with MP-376 240 mg BID had ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN, 2 (0.9%) had ≥ 5 x 
ULN and one (0.2%) had ≥10 x ULN. The proportion with ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN was similar for the MP-376 240 
mg BID and placebo groups (2.0% vs. 2.7%) and slightly lower for MP-376 vs. TIS (2.8% vs. 4.4%). No patients 
had AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN.

Safety in special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Safety data from the 47 patients aged 12 to < 18 years showed no apparent differences vs. adults in the overall 
incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs considered treatment-related, SAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation as far as can 
be judged from such small numbers.

 
In CF studies TEAEs led to discontinuation from the study in 12 (2.9%) who received MP-376 240 mg BID 
and 2 treated once daily. Rates were 2.7% for MP-376 BID vs. 1.4% for placebo and 3.3% for MP-376 BID 
vs. 0 for TIS.  
 
Two patients discontinued study due to TEAEs in clinical pharmacology studies – one had disease 
progression and had moderate severity skin lesions (erythematous bull's eye lesions on extremities), which 
resolved after 17 days.  
 
In the COPD studies 16 MP-376 patients (7.0%) discontinued from the study due to TEAEs vs. 2 (1.8%) 
placebo patients. TEAEs that led to discontinuation in > 1% were vomiting and FEV1 decreased (each in 
1.3% on MP-376 and 0% on placebo) and dyspnoea (1.3% and 0.9%).  
Discontinuation from study drug 
Permanent discontinuation of study drug due to TEAEs was reported in 49 patients (12.0%) receiving MP-376 
240 mg BID and 4 treated once daily. TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were reported at similar 
incidences for MP-376 vs. placebo and also for MP-376 vs. TIS. 
Three patients who entered the Extension Phase of MPEX-209 permanently discontinued study drug. Two 
discontinued due to disease progression and one due to plantar fasciitis.

In the COPD studies permanent discontinuation of study drug due to TEAEs was reported in 49 (21.3%) in the 
MP-376 group vs. 19 (17.1%) in the placebo group. TEAEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
in > 1% of patients were COPD (10.4% MP-376 vs. 8.1% placebo), dyspnoea (2.2% vs. 3.6%), vomiting (1.7% 
vs. 0%), dysgeusia (1.7% vs. 0%), FEV decreased (1.7% vs. 0.9%), chest discomfort (1.3% vs. 0%) and cough 
(1.3% vs. 0.9%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Currently more than 400 CF patients have been exposed to MP-376. Most (257) were in single cycle studies but 
14% discontinued early and not all of those who completed the studies received at least 80% of the assigned 28 
days. In MPEX-209 13% discontinued early but a substantial proportion did not receive at least 80% of the 
assigned 84 days.  
The applicant initially proposed that Quinsair may be used from the age of 12 years and 30 kg body weight in 
repeated cycles. With systemic exposures that are on average ~50% of those achieved with oral and IV dosing 
there were major concerns regarding the safety of 28-day cycles in adolescents that cannot be addressed from 
the available data. The long-term safety profile of Quinsair in adults remains unclear (the long-term use of 
Quinsair in adults is subject to cautionary SmPC wording and the need to further characterise it is adequately 
reflected in the RMP). 
Observations on the safety profile of MP-376 dosed at 240 mg BID 
The overall TEAE reporting rates were mostly comparable between MP-376 and each of placebo and TIS. The 
imbalance in TEAEs considered to be treatment-related was driven by the dysgeusia associated with 
levofloxacin. Dysgeusia did not precipitate a large number of withdrawals from study drug yet the total rates for 
discontinuation of study drug due to TEAEs were higher for MP-376 than for placebo or TIS.  
Compared to placebo and TIS, the rates for cough, sputum increased and paranasal sinus hypersecretion were 
higher for MP-376. There were some other TEAEs (such as haemoptysis) that occurred less often in total with 
MP-376 but treatment-related cases showed higher rates for MP-376. The overall picture suggests that MP-376 
causes some degree of irritation of the respiratory tract epithelium although it appears that most patients put up 
with this and carried on with treatment. Related to this observation, and the reports of bronchospasm as a TEAE, 
the protocols encouraged patients with a marked drop in FEV1 from pre- to post-dose to take a bronchodilator 
just before study drug dosing. The numbers who actually did this were very low. 
In the placebo-controlled studies some additional TEAEs that occurred more often with MP-376 were nausea, 
headache and pyrexia. The latter was not associated with an imbalance in rates of TEAEs in the SOC infections 
and infestations and was not associated with low WBC counts or increases in urinary WBCs (which occurred 
more often with MP-376 than placebo).  
Rates of TEAEs for those who entered the extension phase of MPEX-209 did not show any consistent trend to 
increase or decrease from the first 3 cycles to 4-6 cycles but numbers in the extension phase were very limited. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 95/106 
 
  
  
  
 
It would be expected that rates of hypersensitivity reactions will be at least as high with MP-376 compared to 
systemic administration. Statements were added to the SmPC to reflect this issue. 
Regarding the types of AEs that are recognised to occur with fluoroquinolones the cases are relatively few but 
they do suggest that inhaled levofloxacin poses a risk for hepatotoxicity and possibly tendon and cartilage 
disorders and peripheral neuropathy. Comparisons with placebo make it less clear whether levofloxacin was 
implicated in the cases of dysglycaemia and cytopenias although the rate of dysglycaemia was higher for 
MP-376 than for TIS in the 3-cycle study.  
Apart from disease progression, the SAEs do not point to any specific problems with MP-376. The percentage 
reporting any SAE over 3 cycles in MPEX-209 was higher than for single cycles but the total rate was lower for 
MP-376 than for TIS. 
Potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities do not appear to have occurred at higher rates with 
MP-376 vs. placebo or TIS except for some differences for AST vs. placebo (1.6% vs. none) and for ALT vs. TIS 
(1.7% vs. 1.1%). When these cases of increased AST and ALT are viewed by degree of abnormality it becomes 
apparent that the highest values also occurred in the MP-376 group.    
Numbers aged 12-<18 years were small but the TEAE profile did not seem to be very different vs. adults.   
Overall, it should be assumed that MP-376 will be associated with TEAEs recognised to occur with systemic doses 
of levofloxacin and this conclusion has been reflected in the SmPC. The risk of QTc prolongation may be lower 
since this is the most likely TEAE to show a direct relationship with serum levels. However, similar warnings 
regarding administration to patients with other risk factors have been included. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The CHMP Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues dated 25 September 2014 contained a Major Objection further to 
the refined POPPK model, which has confirmed that there is very considerable systemic exposure to levofloxacin 
following inhalation of Quinsair 240 mg twice daily (approximately 50% of that observed following comparable 
oral or intravenous administration of levofloxacin). Quinsair is proposed for use in 28-day cycles and for 
repeated usage and there are inadequate safety data relevant to long-term exposures in adults or adolescents 
to assess the possible effects of chronic substantial systemic exposures. 
The applicant provided supportive long-term safety data beyond one year in the adult population but the data for 
patients below 18 years of age were deemed insufficient in view of the toxicology studies in juvenile animals 
showing inflammation and subsequent destruction of weight-bearing joints. Therefore, the paediatric population 
was removed from the indication section of the proposed SmPC for Quinsair. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
It is concluded that due to observed substantial systemic exposures, there remains a major concern on the 
safety of 28-day cycles in adolescents.  Since this cannot be addressed from the available data, the applicant 
withdrew the indication claim for that age group. Likewise, the long-term safety profile of Quinsair in adults 
remains unclear and hence the long-term use of Quinsair in adults is subject to cautionary SmPC wording and 
the need to further characterise it is adequately reflected in the RMP.

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption for the ampoule label of the labelling as per Article 63(1) of Directive 
2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. 
The applicant proposed to label the 2.4 ml ampoules (which meet the definition of a small container) with all of 
the labelling particulars set out in Article 55(3) of Directive 2001/83, using English language only for all Member 
States. 
The only elements of the ampoule label that would not be understood by non-English speakers are the 
pharmaceutical form and the route of administration, which would be clearly described in the package leaflet and 
on the labelling of the outer carton (both available in the native language). Moreover, the ampoule is kept within 
a sachet that will be fully labelled in the respective language(s) of the Member States. Based on the stability data 
of the product (which is light sensitive) the ampoule has to be kept in the fully labelled sachet until ready for use; 
therefore, all necessary information will always be available in all languages. 
The applicant also provided information on the prevalence of the disease in the EU (IE and UK having the highest 
rates). 
The QRD Group accepted the company’s request without any objections. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group position above will be translated in all 
languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website; the printed materials will only be translated 
in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Quinsair (MP-376) is provided as a high concentration solution to facilitate rapid nebulization (~ 5 minutes). The 
concentrations achieved in sputum are considerably greater than the expected MICs of levofloxacin for P. 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 102/106 
 
  
  
  
aeruginosa in an adult CF population. At present, no dedicated formulation of a fluoroquinolone for inhalation 
has been approved so availability of Quinsair would make it possible to administer inhaled agents from 4 drug 
classes in a cyclical rotational fashion. 
In a mainly adult and heavily pre-treated CF population that was naïve to inhaled fluoroquinolones Quinsair 
achieved modest increases in FEV1. A single cycle of 240 mg BID was superior to placebo for change in FEV1 and 
was non-inferior to TIS for relative change in FEV1 percent predicted in a population that had considerable prior 
and recent exposure to inhaled tobramycin. The effect of Quinsair was numerically better than that of TIS over 
3 cycles. A benefit on FEV1 was observed when TIS patients switched to MP-376 after three cycles of assigned 
study therapy, which supports its likely utility in rotational antimicrobial regimens. 
For most (but not all) of the other pre-defined efficacy endpoints in the Phase 3 studies Quinsair was superior to 
placebo and numerically better than TIS, including the change from baseline to day 28 in the Respiratory 
Domain of the CFQ-R score.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The beneficial (although modest) effect of MP-376 on PFTs in MPEX-207 conflicted with failure to show 
superiority over placebo for time to exacerbation, which was the pre-defined primary endpoint.  
The CSR for study MPEX-209 reported an effect of MP-376 on FEV1 that was modest but at least as good (and 
numerically better) than that of TIS over 1-3 cycles in a population that was pre-treated with inhaled 
tobramycin. As in other recent application dossiers for inhaled antibacterial agents in CF patients chronically 
colonised with P. aeruginosa it is not possible to gauge how inhaled levofloxacin would have compared with TOBI 
in a population that was naïve to both treatments. MPEX-209 showed non-inferiority for MP-376 vs. TOBI but it 
was not superior, which would have allayed the concern regarding the value of showing non-inferiority against 
an agent that no longer achieves a discernible effect on FEV1. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The extent of systemic exposure to levofloxacin after inhalation of Quinsair 240 mg BID to steady state is 
considerable. Serum levels average ~50% of those observed on systemic dosing at 500 mg QD. Therefore, all 
of the adverse reactions observed with systemic administration of levofloxacin (except those specific to the 
route of administration) can be expected to occur during inhalational therapy with MP-376.  
These include hepatotoxicity and other effects on laboratory parameters as well as clinical effects such as 
nausea. QTc prolongation is also a risk in patients who are predisposed for some reason and it should be noted 
that worst case systemic exposures with Quinsair overlap with those routinely observed with systemic 
treatment.  
The observed AE profile indicates that inhalation of Quinsair, which includes magnesium chloride, is fairly irritant 
to the upper and lower airways. Nevertheless, the discontinuation rates due to these effects were modest. The 
more difficult issue for patients has been dysgeusia, which has been perceived as severe in some cases, 
although few discontinued the treatment due to this AE. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In light of the systemic exposure to levofloxacin after inhalation of MP-376 240 mg BID to steady state and the 
anticipated repeated cyclical use of the product, even if interspersed with cycles of other inhaled antibacterial 
EMA/CHMP/676680/2014 
Page 103/106 
 
  
  
  
agents, the potential long term consequences in adults cannot be predicted. There are inadequate data on 
chronic exposures to levofloxacin with Quinsair itself (< 150 patients have received 3 cycles and < 50 have 
received 6 cycles) or with systemic treatment to assist in evaluating the magnitude of risk. 
The repeated cyclical use of Quinsair in adolescents poses additional concerns to those in adults due to the 
potential effects on cartilage. Although the fluoroquinolones are already very widely used in CF patients aged < 
18 years this is usually short-term systemic exposure to treat exacerbations. Since other treatment options are 
available to adolescents for management of chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa it is not possible to justify 
use of Quinsair in this age group. On this basis, the applicant withdrew any claim for use in subjects aged < 18 
years during the procedure 
Benefit-risk balance 
Benefit-risk balance 
The addition of Quinsair to the three antibacterial agents already approved for inhalational use in the EU would 
allow for further rotational cyclical regimens of treatments from different classes. There is a need to further 
characterise the safety profile that will be associated with chronic substantive systemic exposures in adults. This 
issue cannot be resolved based on currently available data and therefore is a substantial risk reflected in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Cystic fibrosis, an orphan condition, is a life-shortening and chronically debilitating disease that greatly affects 
patient quality of life and significantly reduces survival. CF patients suffer from chronic infections of the lower 
respiratory tract that can be caused by multiple bacteria, particularly P. aeruginosa, implicated as the major 
cause of lung function decline. 
Over the past decade, inhaled nebulized antimicrobials have become a standard part of maintenance therapy in 
patients with CF with documented chronic P. aeruginosa infection. A few inhaled antimicrobials are currently in 
wide use in Europe for CF lung disease. However, owing to clinical tolerance, and limited substitution potential 
with the existing therapies, there is an unmet need for additional inhaled antibiotics capable of effectively 
treating chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection in CF.  
Quinsair fulfils this unmet need and is intended to be the first inhaled fluoroquinolone therapy for this 
therapeutic use.  Submitted data demonstrated benefits for the use of Quinsair in antibiotic-experienced 
patients with diminished lung function. Quinsair was well tolerated during the clinical study programme with a 
favourable safety profile, although there are inadequate data on the effect of chronic exposures. Also, the extent 
of systemic exposure to levofloxacin after inhalation of Quinsair is deemed considerable. Hence, taking account 
the supplemental potential risk on cartilage in adolescents and available alternatives, the use of the product 
cannot be justified for use in this age group. The CHMP requested the conduct of a non-interventional 
post-authorisation safety study in a registry of adult patients with cystic fibrosis to investigate the long term 
safety profile of Quinsair in normal clinical practice in the European Union.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Quinsair is not similar to Cayston, TOBI Podhaler, Bronchitol and 
Kalydeco within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Quinsair in the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

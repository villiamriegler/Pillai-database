EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Final Study Report for Protocol 0624-400 was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. 
Title of the study: 
“A phase 4 study to evaluate the safety and effect of escalating doses of CINRYZE® (C1 inhibitor 
[human]) as prophylactic therapy in subjects with inadequately controlled hereditary angioedema 
attacks (Protocol 0624-400)”. 
II. 
RECOMMENDATION 
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. 
III. 
REGULATORY BACKGROUND 
As a condition of CINRYZE approval October 2008 in the US for routine prophylaxis against 
angioedema attacks in patients with HAE, ViroPharma conducted Protocol 0624-400 as a post licensure 
requirement study with a commitment of submitting the clinical study report October 2012. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and treatment effect of escalating doses of CINRYZE. 
The original PIP application for CINRYZE did not include this protocol, but, at the request of the PDCO, 
it was added with a specific requirement to enrol 6 children. 
Recruitment into Protocol 0624-400 proved challenging due to few patients failing to respond to the 
approved preventive dosing regimen of CINRYZE and this proved even more challenging for children. 
Based on the diligent efforts to identify and enrol paediatric subjects in this study in the US, which 
included contacting 63 centres treating paediatric patients, it was not feasible to enrol six paediatric 
patients who were failing to respond adequately to CINRYZE within any foreseeable timeframe. Despite 
these substantive recruitment efforts no children < 12 years of age were enrolled; only one 16 year 
old was enrolled. 
A request for a modification was made by ViroPharma to remove this study from the PIP to enable it to 
be closed and reported to the FDA as required by US law (Food and Drug Administration Amendments 
Act of 2007). The PDCO did not agree with the proposed modification without “addressing the gap in 
paediatric information through other measures”. ViroPharma was advised to “address the PDCO’s 
concerns in a new modification procedure by providing sufficient data and/or amending their paediatric 
clinical development programme accordingly.” In response, ViroPharma has submitted a new request 
for modification to delete Protocol 0624-400 from the PIP and replace with a new paediatric study 
(Protocol 0624-207). This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, treatment effect and 
immunogenicity of CINRYZE IV for the prevention of angioedema attacks in children 6-11 years of age.

Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH submitted a study report with only one paediatric patient of 16 years amongst 20 included 
subjects. 
2. Clinical study 
  Description 
This open-label, multicenter, Phase 4 study assessed escalating doses of IV CINRYZE (1500 U, 2000 U, 
and 2500 U) as prophylactic therapy to lower the angioedema attack rate in subjects who were not 
adequately controlled while receiving the recommended CINRYZE dosing regimen (1000 U every 3 to 4 
days via IV injection). 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
The objectives of this study were: (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of 
CINRYZE; (2) to assess the effect of an escalating dose algorithm for CINRYZE on angioedema attack 
rates; and (3) to assess the immunogenicity of CINRYZE. 
•  Study design 
Open-label multicenter Phase 4 study 
First subject was dosed 31Aug2009 and last subject contact was 24May2012. Subjects with qualifying 
angioedema attack rates, and who met other specified entry criteria, were entered into a 3-step dose-
escalation algorithm. Each step consisted of 12 weeks of initial monitoring of subject safety while 
receiving the escalated prophylaxis therapy dose, followed by computation of the average monthly 
attack rate based on subject reports of any angioedema attack (regardless of intensity) and the actual 
duration of therapy for that step. 
•  Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
To qualify for enrollment, a subject had to: 
- Be ≥6 years of age and ≥25 kg body weight. 
- Have a confirmed diagnosis of HAE with a documented history of swelling of the face, extremities, 
gastrointestinal tract, genitalia, or larynx and a history of at least one of the following: 
⋅ 
⋅ 
⋅ 
⋅ 
⋅ 
C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) gene mutation 
C4 level below the lower limit of the reference range 
C1 inhibitor antigen level below the lower limit of the reference range 
Functional C1 inhibitor level below the lower limit of the reference range 
Family history of HAE (i.e., grandparent, parent, sibling)

- Have a history of >1.0 angioedema attack per month (average) of any severity during the 3 
consecutive months prior to screening while receiving the recommended CINRYZE dosing of 1000 U 
every 3 to 4 days via IV injection. 
- Have not had a history of abnormal blood clotting or other coagulopathy. 
- Have not received any blood products (other than CINRYZE) within 60 days prior to screening. 
•  Study population  
Enrolled and treated subjects, N=20 
Gender=Females, 14 (70%); Males, 6 (30%) 
Race=White/Caucasian, 18 (90%); Black/African American, 1 (5%); Other (Mexican), 1 (5%) 
Ethnicity=Hispanic/Latino, 2 (10%); Not Hispanic/Latino, 18 (90%) 
Age (Mean ± SD): 41.7 ± 15.3 years (range: 16-77 years) 
•  Number of subjects (planned and analysed) 
Twenty (20) subjects were planned for enrollment. Twenty (20) subjects were enrolled and treated 
with IV CINRYZE and analyzed for safety. 
•  Treatments 
Duration of treatment was 2 times/week for 12 weeks in each dose-escalation step (Steps 1-3) and 2 
times/week for 3 months in the follow-up period. 
20 subjects received 1500 U CINRYZE in dose-escalation Step 1; 13 subjects were dose-escalated to 
Step 2 and received 2000 U CINRYZE, 12 of whom were dose-escalated to Step 3 and received 2500 U 
CINRYZE. Sixteen (16) subjects (80%) completed treatment and 17 subjects (85%) completed the 
study. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy assessments included the following: Incidence of any angioedema attacks as determined by 
subject reported diary data, use of rescue therapy, hospitalization, and/or use of other therapy for 
treating an angioedema attack (e.g., androgens). Angioedema attacks included the following: (1) any 
attack of swelling or pain typical of an HAE event and subsequently recorded by the subject, study 
personnel, or home health care professionals, and (2) Actionable attacks, where “Actionable” was 
defined as seeking medical attention including any of the following interventions: IV fluids, narcotics, 
plasma administration, or C1 INH therapy. 
A subject was deemed a “success” (an average of ≤1.0 angioedema attack/month) at the most recent 
dosing step and the investigator and medical monitor determined that it was safe for the subject to 
continue on that dose. This subject entered the 3-month follow-up period at that dose level with 
continued safety monitoring. 
The subject could not re-enter the study for purposes of dose escalation during any “follow-up” period. 
A subject was deemed a “failure” (an average of >1.0 angioedema attack/month), and the next higher 
step of the dose-escalation algorithm was initiated for that subject provided that the investigator and 
medical monitor agreed that the subject was sufficiently compliant and that dose escalation was 
appropriate.

After a minimum of 6 months for those adequately controlled on the entry dose of this study (1500 U 
twice per week) and a maximum of 12 months of enrollment for subjects reaching the third tier of dose 
escalation (2500 U twice per week), subjects completed the study and their follow up was referred to 
the physician who managed their HAE care. 
If four (or more) patients were deemed to have achieved successful control, the study was declared a 
success. 
Safety was monitored through the recording of AEs and any changes in physical examinations, vital 
signs, and clinical safety laboratory testing. Confirmed diagnoses of clinically significant thrombotic or 
thromboembolic events were to be reported as serious adverse events. 
• 
 Statistical Methods 
Safety: Descriptive statistics (e.g., N, mean, SE, SD, median, range) were reported for baseline, post-
baseline, and change from baseline values in clinical laboratory (testing performed pre-dose on Day 1 
of dose escalation Step 1 [baseline] and at Week 12 and follow-up Month 3 for each dose level) and 
vital signs (BP and HR measured immediately before and approximately 15 minutes after completion of 
each injection) parameters. Two summaries of AEs were provided: all treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) and all TEAEs related to study drug. 
Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) Version 15.0. 
Efficacy: In this study, the calculation of angioedema attack rates included all reported attacks, 
regardless of severity, whether Actionable or not. Subject-reported HAE symptoms that occurred on 
consecutive days constituted one angioedema attack. The attack rate for a therapy period, nominally 
84 days (12 weeks), was normalized to a monthly attack rate using the following formula: 
Monthly attack rate = 30.4 x (# angioedema attacks in period) / (# days monitored in period) 
Thus, the calculated attack rate was based only on the formal observation interval (during which 
attacks were explicitly monitored). This same calculation was performed for Actionable attacks by 
substituting for the numerator the number of Actionable attacks in the observation period. Subjects 
observed to have an average monthly attack rate of ≤1.0 per month at the end of any step (Week 12) 
were deemed a “success” based on the protocol definition. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Twenty subjects were enrolled and treated with IV CINRYZE and analyzed for safety: 20 subjects 
received 1500 U CINRYZE in dose-escalation Step 1; 13 subjects were dose-escalated to Step 2 and 
received 2000 U CINRYZE, 12 of whom were dose-escalated to Step 3 and received 2500 U CINRYZE. 
Sixteen (16) subjects (80%) completed treatment and 17 subjects (85%) completed the study. The 
study population was composed of 14 (70%) females and the majority of subjects were white 18 
(90%). The mean age (± SD) was 41.7 ± 15.3 years (range: 16-77 years). 
•  Efficacy results 
All subjects enrolled in this study (n=20) had recurrent angioedema attacks despite therapy with 
CINRYZE 1000 U IV twice weekly; notably 3 of these subjects were receiving CINRYZE 1000 U IV thrice 
weekly. All of these refractory subjects started the study at an IV CINRYZE dose of 1500 U (Step 1); 
13 subjects were dose escalated to 2000 U (Step 2), 12 of whom were further dose escalated to 2500 
U (Step 3). Nine (45%) of the 20 subjects were deemed a success based on the protocol definition 
(i.e., an average of ≤1.0 angioedema attack/month at the end of any step [Week 12]) and continued

on their final CINRYZE dose during follow-up at the investigator’s discretion: 4 subjects at Step 1 
(1500 U) and 5 subjects at Step 3 (2500 U). Of note, 1 of these subjects was also a success at Step 2 
(2000 U), based on the protocol definition; however, this subject was dose-escalated to Step 3, at the 
investigator’s clinical discretion. As outlined in the protocol efficacy assumptions, this study can be 
declared a success because greater than 4 subjects had an average of ≤1.0 angioedema 
attacks/month at the end of any step. 
2 subjects had angioedema attack rates slightly above the limits of protocol defined success at their 
final dose level and continued on their final dose during follow-up at the investigator’s discretion: 1 
subject at Step 1 (1500 U) and 1 subject at Step 3 (2500 U) had monthly average attack rates of 1.4 
and 1.8, respectively.  
3 further subjects were found with a reduction from historical angioedema attack rate of >1 at the end 
of any step (Week 12): 1 subject at Step 1 (1500 U) and 2 subjects at Step 3 (2500 U). 
Overall, 11 (55%) of 20 subjects were deemed clinical failures (i.e., an average of >1.0 angioedema 
attack/month at the end of any step [Week 12]). Of note, 2 of these 6 subjects prematurely 
discontinued treatment and study: 1 subject during Step 1 (received only 9 doses of study drug); and 
1 subject during Step 2 (received only 9 doses of study drug during Step 2). 
•  Safety results 
No deaths were reported during this study. 
Two subjects experienced SAEs during the study; however, these events were considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug (cerebral hygroma for 1 subject; and HAE [verbatim: 
laryngeal angioedema attack], anemia [verbatim: anemia (worsening)], and bile duct stone [verbatim: 
worsening choledocholithiasis] for 1 subject). One of these subjects had study drug interrupted due to 
2 SAEs while receiving 2000 U CINRYZE (due to hospitalization). 
No subject was discontinued from escalating doses of IV CINRYZE up to 2500 U due to an AE. 
No subjects experienced a systemic thrombotic or thromboembolic TEAE during the study. 
90% of all subjects (18/20) reported 1 or more TEAEs during the study: 75% (15/20) of subjects 
receiving 1500 U CINRYZE, 85% (11/13) of subjects receiving 2000 U CINRYZE, and 92% (11/12) of 
subjects receiving 2500 U CINRYZE. The most frequently reported TEAE following IV injection of 
CINRYZE across all dose levels was URTI, reported by 25% (5/20) of all subjects, followed in overall 
frequency by nasopharyngitis, reported by 15% (3/20) of all subjects. 
The majority of TEAEs in this study (95%, 86/91 events) were considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to study drug; 2 (10%) of the 20 subjects had a total of 5 events that were considered 
related to CINRYZE: catheter site pain (1 event at 1500 U, 1 event at 2500 U), dyspnea (2500 U, Day 
173), and medical device complication (verbatim: blood clot in port; 1500 U, onset Day 81), reported 
by 1 subject and muscle spasms (2000 U, also related to concomitant medication for pre-existing 
chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]) reported by 1 subject. The medical device complication (blood clot in 
port) was treated locally with streptokinase with complete resolution. 
Results of clinical laboratory evaluations and vital signs measurements were generally unremarkable 
and did not suggest any treatment-emergent abnormalities related to the administration of CINRYZE. 
C1 INH antibodies (inhibitors): Two subjects who had progressed through dose escalation Steps 1-3 
(1500, 2000, and 2500 U, respectively) had C1 INH antibodies detected in plasma samples collected 
during the study. Both were deemed clinical failures.

One subject had C1 INH antibodies detected at baseline (pre-dose Day 1) and in all samples collected 
at Week 12 of Steps 1 (1500 U), 2 (2000 U), and 3 (2500 U), respectively. The other subject had no 
detectable C1 INH antibodies at baseline (pre-dose Day 1), or at Week 12 of Step 1 (1500 U) and Step 
2 (2000 U); subsequently, C1 INH antibodies were detected (ratio of 5.6) in the plasma sample 
collected at Week 12 of Step 3 (2500 U). An evaluation is ongoing to further characterize these C1 INH 
antibodies. No other subjects had detectable C1 INH antibodies in any of the samples analyzed. 
•  Data regarding paediatric subjects 
The only pediatric subject enrolled in the study was a 16 year old male subject with a 4 year diagnosis 
of HAE. At baseline, he had a historical monthly attack rate of 11 and missed approximately 20 days of 
school per month. During the first dose escalation step (1500 U) he experienced 11 attacks over 83 
days and had a reduction in monthly attack rate to 1.7 (based on 181 days of follow-up). At the end of 
Step 1, the subject prematurely discontinued treatment on Day 83 and subsequently withdrew from 
the study at the investigator/sponsor discretion due to travel outside of the USA. The patient received 
a total of 24 CINRYZE doses which were well tolerated. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The Clinical Study Report of study 0624-400 has been submitted in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The only included paediatric subject (ID 4001004) was prematurely 
discontinued from the study at the end of Step 1 (1500 U) dose-escalation. No individual data has 
been provided regarding efficacy and safety. According to the expert statement all doses in this patient 
were well tolerated.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Bosulif is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with:

newly-diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous 
leukaemia (Ph+ CML).
 CP, accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Ph+ CML previously treated with one or 
more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) [TKI(s)] and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are 
not considered appropriate treatment options.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and the treatment of patients
with CML.
2
Posology
Newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML
The recommended dose is 400 mg bosutinib once daily.
CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy
The recommended dose is 500 mg bosutinib once daily.
In clinical trials for both indications, treatment with bosutinib continued until disease progression or 
intolerance to therapy.
Dose adjustments
In the Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 
dose escalations from 500 mg to 600 mg once daily with food were allowed in patients who failed to 
demonstrate complete haematological response (CHR) by Week 8 or complete cytogenetic response 
(CCyR) by Week 12 and did not have Grade 3 or higher adverse events possibly-related to the 
investigational product. In the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML 
treated with bosutinib 400 mg, dose escalations by 100 mg increments to a maximum of 600 mg once 
daily with food were permitted if the patient failed to demonstrate breakpoint cluster region-Abelson 
(BCR-ABL) transcripts ≤ 10% at Month 3, did not have a Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction at the time of 
escalation, and all Grade 2 non-haematological toxicities were resolved to at least Grade 1. In the 
Phase 4 clinical study in patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s), dose 
escalations from 500 mg to 600 mg once daily with food were allowed in patients with unsatisfactory
response or with signs of disease progression in the absence of any Grade 3 or 4 or persistent Grade 2 
adverse events.
In the Phase 1/2 study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy who 
started treatment at ≤ 500 mg, 93 (93/558; 16.7%) patients had dose escalations to 600 mg daily.
In the Phase 3 study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML who started bosutinib treatment at 
400 mg, a total of 58 patients (21.6%) received dose escalations to 500 mg daily. In addition, 10.4% of 
patients in the bosutinib treatment group had further dose escalations to 600 mg daily.
In the Phase 4 study in patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s) who started 
bosutinib treatment at 500 mg daily, 1 patient (0.6%) had a dose escalation up to 600 mg daily.
Doses greater than 600 mg/day have not been studied and, therefore, should not be given.
Dose adjustments for adverse reactions
Non-haematological adverse reactions
If clinically significant moderate or severe non-haematological toxicity develops, bosutinib should be 
interrupted, and may be resumed at a dose reduced by 100 mg taken once daily after the toxicity has 
resolved. If clinically appropriate, re-escalation to the dose prior to the dose reduction taken once daily 
should be considered (see section 4.4). Doses less than 300 mg/day have been used in patients; 
however, efficacy has not been established.
Elevated liver transaminases: If elevations in liver transaminases > 5 × institutional upper limit of 
normal (ULN) occur, bosutinib should be interrupted until recovery to ≤ 2.5 × ULN and may be 
resumed at 400 mg once daily thereafter. If recovery takes longer than 4 weeks, discontinuation of 
bosutinib should be considered. If transaminase elevations ≥ 3 × ULN occur concurrently with 
bilirubin elevations > 2 × ULN and alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN, bosutinib should be discontinued 
(see section 4.4).
3
Diarrhoea: For NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3-4 
diarrhoea, bosutinib should be interrupted and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily upon recovery to 
grade ≤ 1 (see section 4.4).
Haematological adverse reactions
Dose reductions are recommended for severe or persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as 
described in Table 1:
Table 1 – Dose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
ANCa < 1.0 × 109/L 
and/or
Platelets < 50 × 109/L
a ANC = absolute neutrophil count
Special populations
Hold bosutinib until ANC  1.0 × 109/L and platelets 
 50 × 109/L.
Resume treatment with bosutinib at the same dose if recovery 
occurs within 2 weeks. If blood counts remain low for 
> 2 weeks, upon recovery reduce dose by 100 mg and resume 
treatment.
If cytopoenia recurs, reduce dose by an additional 100 mg upon 
recovery and resume treatment. 
Doses less than 300 mg/day have been used; however, efficacy 
has not been established.
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years)
No specific dose recommendation is necessary in the elderly. Since there is limited information in the 
elderly, caution should be exercised in these patients.
Renal impairment
Patients with serum creatinine > 1.5×ULN were excluded from CML studies. Increasing exposure 
(area under curve [AUC]) in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment during studies was 
observed.
Newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCr] 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated 
by the Cockcroft-Gault formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 300 mg daily with food (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
In patients with severe renal impairment (CLCr < 30 mL/min, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 200 mg daily with food (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Dose escalation to 400 mg once daily with food for patients with moderate renal impairment or to 
300 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment may be considered if they do not 
experience severe or persistent moderate adverse reactions and if they do not achieve an adequate 
haematological, cytogenetic, or molecular response.
CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLCr 30 to 50 mL/min, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 400 mg daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
In patients with severe renal impairment (CLCr < 30 mL/min, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 300 mg daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
4
Dose escalation to 500 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment or to 400 mg once 
daily in patients with severe renal impairment may be considered in those who did not experience 
severe or persistent moderate adverse reactions, and if they do not achieve an adequate 
haematological, cytogenetic, or molecular response.
Cardiac disorders 
In clinical studies, patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (e.g., recent myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure or unstable angina) were excluded. Caution should be exercised in 
patients with relevant cardiac disorders (see section 4.4).
Recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder
In clinical studies, patients with recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder 
(e.g., severe vomiting and/or diarrhoea) were excluded. Caution should be exercised in patients with 
recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of bosutinib in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not 
been established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Bosulif should be taken orally once daily with food (see section 5.2). If a dose is missed by more than 
12 hours, the patient should not be given an additional dose. The patient should take the usual 
prescribed dose on the following day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Liver function abnormalities
Treatment with bosutinib is associated with elevations in serum transaminases (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).
Transaminase elevations generally occurred early in the course of treatment (of the patients who 
experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, > 80% experienced their first event within the first 
3 months). Patients receiving bosutinib should have liver function tests prior to treatment initiation and
monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, and as clinically indicated. 
Patients with transaminase elevations should be managed by withholding bosutinib temporarily (with 
consideration given to dose reduction after recovery to Grade 1 or baseline), and/or discontinuation of 
bosutinib. Elevations of transaminases, particularly in the setting of concomitant increases in bilirubin, 
may be an early indication of drug-induced liver injury and these patients should be managed 
appropriately (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Diarrhoea and vomiting
Treatment with bosutinib is associated with diarrhoea and vomiting; therefore, patients with recent or 
ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder should use this medicinal product with caution 
and only after a careful benefit-risk assessment as respective patients were excluded from the clinical 
studies. Patients with diarrhoea and vomiting should be managed using standard-of-care treatment, 
including an antidiarrhoeal or antiemetic medicinal product and/or fluid replacement. In addition, 
diarrhoea and vomiting can also be managed by withholding bosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, 
and/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). The antiemetic agent, domperidone, has 
the potential to increase QT interval (QTc) prolongation and to induce “torsade de pointes”-
5
arrhythmias; therefore, co-administration with domperidone should be avoided. It should only be used, 
if other medicinal products are not efficacious. In these situations an individual benefit-risk assessment 
is mandatory and patients should be monitored for occurrence of QTc prolongation.
Myelosuppression
Treatment with bosutinib is associated with myelosuppression, defined as anaemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia. Complete blood counts should be performed weekly for the first month and then 
monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression should/can be managed by 
withholding bosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, and/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see
sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Fluid retention
Treatment with bosutinib may be associated with fluid retention including pericardial effusion, pleural 
effusion, pulmonary oedema and/or peripheral oedema. Patients should be monitored and managed 
using standard-of-care treatment. In addition, fluid retention can also be managed by withholding 
bosutinib temporarily, dose reduction, and/or discontinuation of bosutinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Serum lipase 
Elevation in serum lipase has been observed. Caution is recommended in patients with previous 
history of pancreatitis. In case lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, bosutinib
should be interrupted and appropriate diagnostic measures considered to exclude pancreatitis (see 
section 4.2).
Infections 
Bosutinib may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoan infections.
Proarrhythmic potential
Automated machine-read QTc prolongation without accompanying arrhythmia has been observed.
Bosutinib should be administered with caution to patients who have a history of or predisposition for 
QTc prolongation, who have uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial 
infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia, or who are 
taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc (e.g., anti-arrhythmic medicinal products
and other substances that may prolong QTc [see section 4.5]). The presence of hypokalaemia and 
hypomagnesaemia may further enhance this effect.
Monitoring for an effect on the QTc is advisable and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is 
recommended prior to initiating therapy with bosutinib and as clinically indicated. Hypokalaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to bosutinib administration and should be monitored 
periodically during therapy.
Renal impairment
Treatment with bosutinib may result in a clinically significant decline in renal function in CML 
patients. A decline over time in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been observed in 
patients treated with bosutinib in clinical studies. In patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML treated 
with 400 mg, the median decline from baseline in eGFR was 11.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 1 year and 
14.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 5 years for patients on treatment. Treatment-naïve CML patients treated with 
500 mg showed a median eGFR decline of 9.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 1 year, 12.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 
5 years and 16.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 10 years for patients on treatment. In pre-treated patients with CP 
and advanced stage CML treated with 500 mg the median eGFR decline was 7.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 
1 year, 12.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 5 years and 15.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 10 years for patients on treatment. 
In patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s) treated with 500 mg, the median 
eGFR decline from baseline was 9.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 1 year and 14.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 at 4 years for 
patients on treatment.
It is important that renal function is assessed prior to treatment initiation and closely monitored during 
therapy with bosutinib, with particular attention in those patients who have pre-existing renal 
6
compromise or in those patients exhibiting risk factors for renal dysfunction, including concomitant 
use of medicinal products with potential for nephrotoxicity, such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs).
In a renal impairment study, bosutinib exposures were increased in subjects with moderately and 
severely impaired renal function. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN were excluded from the CML studies. Based on a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis increasing exposure (AUC) in patients with moderate and severe 
renal impairment at initiation of treatment during studies was observed (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Clinical data are very limited (n = 3) for CML patients with moderate renal impairment receiving an 
escalated dose of 600 mg bosutinib.
Asian race
According to population pharmacokinetic analyses, Asians had a lower clearance resulting in 
increased exposure. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions 
especially in case of dose escalation.
Severe skin reactions
Bosutinib can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal 
Necrolysis. Bosutinib should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe skin 
reaction during treatment.
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Due to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant 
dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of bosutinib 
(see section 4.8).
Hepatitis B reactivation
Reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after 
these patients received BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or fulminant 
hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. 
Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with bosutinib. Experts in liver 
disease and in the treatment of HBV should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with 
positive HBV serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test positive for 
HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with bosutinib should be 
closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several 
months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8).
Photosensitivity 
Exposure to direct sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) radiation should be avoided or minimised due to the 
risk of photosensitivity associated with bosutinib treatment. Patients should be instructed to use 
measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). 
Cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A inhibitors
The concomitant use of bosutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided, as an 
increase in bosutinib plasma concentration will occur (see section 4.5). 
Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A inhibition 
potential, if possible, is recommended.
7
If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be administered during bosutinib treatment, an 
interruption of bosutinib therapy or a dose reduction in bosutinib should be considered.
CYP3A inducers
The concomitant use of bosutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided as a 
decrease in bosutinib plasma concentration will occur (see section 4.5).
Food effect
Grapefruit products, including grapefruit juice and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A 
should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Dietary sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg 
tablet. Patients on low sodium diets should be informed that this product is essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effects of other medicinal products on bosutinib
CYP3A inhibitors
The concomitant use of bosutinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,
mibefradil, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, 
grapefruit products including grapefruit juice) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not 
limited to fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, amprenavir, atazanavir,
darunavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir, aprepitant, crizotinib, imatinib) should be avoided, as an increase 
in bosutinib plasma concentration will occur.
Caution should be exercised if mild CYP3A inhibitors are used concomitantly with bosutinib.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A enzyme 
inhibition potential, if possible, is recommended.
If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be administered during bosutinib treatment, an 
interruption of bosutinib therapy or a dose reduction in bosutinib should be considered.
In a study of 24 healthy subjects in whom 5 daily doses of 400 mg ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor) were co-administered with a single dose of 100 mg bosutinib under fasting conditions, 
ketoconazole increased bosutinib Cmax by 5.2-fold, and bosutinib AUC in plasma by 8.6-fold, as 
compared with administration of bosutinib alone.
In a study of 20 healthy subjects, in whom a single dose of 125 mg aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor) was co-administered with a single dose of 500 mg bosutinib under fed conditions, aprepitant 
increased bosutinib Cmax by 1.5-fold, and bosutinib AUC in plasma by 2.0-fold, as compared with 
administration of bosutinib alone.
CYP3A inducers 
The concomitant use of bosutinib with strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to
carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. John’s Wort), or moderate CYP3A inducers (including, but 
not limited to bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided, as a decrease in 
bosutinib plasma concentration will occur.
Based on the large reduction in bosutinib exposure that occurred when bosutinib was co-administered 
with rifampicin, increasing the dose of bosutinib when co-administering with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inducers is unlikely to sufficiently compensate for the loss of exposure.
8
Caution is warranted if mild CYP3A inducers are used concomitantly with bosutinib. 
Following concomitant administration of a single dose bosutinib with 6 daily doses of 600 mg 
rifampicin, in 24 healthy subjects in fed state bosutinib exposure (Cmax and AUC in plasma) decreased 
to 14% and 6%, respectively, of the values when bosutinib 500 mg was administered alone.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
Caution should be exercised when administering bosutinib concomitantly with PPIs. Short-acting 
antacids should be considered as an alternative to PPIs and administration times of bosutinib and 
antacids should be separated (i.e. take bosutinib in the morning and antacids in the evening) whenever 
possible. Bosutinib displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility in vitro. When a single oral dose of 
bosutinib (400 mg) was co-administered with multiple-oral doses of lansoprazole (60 mg) in a study of 
24 healthy fasting subjects, bosutinib Cmax and AUC decreased to 54% and 74%, respectively, of the 
values seen when bosutinib (400 mg) was given alone.
Effects of bosutinib on other medicinal products
In a study of 27 healthy subjects, in whom a single dose of 500 mg bosutinib was co-administered 
with a single dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate (a P-glycoprotein [P-gp] substrate) under 
fed conditions, bosutinib did not increase Cmax or AUC of dabigatran in plasma, as compared with 
administration of dabigatran etexilate mesylate alone. The study results indicate that bosutinib does
not exhibit clinically relevant P-gp inhibitory effects. 
An in vitro study indicates that drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses as a 
result of induction by bosutinib on the metabolism of medicinal products that are substrates for 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
In vitro studies indicate that clinical drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses
as a result of inhibition by bosutinib on the metabolism of medicinal products that are substrates for 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5.
In vitro studies indicate that bosutinib has a low potential to inhibit breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP, systemically), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion 
transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2 at clinically relevant concentrations, 
but may have the potential to inhibit BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract and OCT1.
Anti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong QT 
Bosutinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of QT, 
including those patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as amiodarone, disopyramide, 
procainamide, quinidine and sotalol or other medicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation 
such as chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, domperidone, haloperidol, methadone, and 
moxifloxacin (see section 4.4).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
with bosutinib and for at least 1 month after the last dose and to avoid becoming pregnant while 
receiving bosutinib. In addition, the patient should be advised that vomiting or diarrhoea may reduce 
the efficacy of oral contraceptives by preventing full absorption.
Pregnancy
There are limited amount of data in pregnant women from the use of bosutinib. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Bosutinib is not recommended for use during 
pregnancy, or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If bosutinib is used during 
9
pregnancy, or the patient becomes pregnant while taking bosutinib, she should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether bosutinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A study of [14C] 
radiolabelled bosutinib in rats demonstrated excretion of bosutinib-derived radioactivity in breast milk
(see section 5.3). A potential risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with bosutinib.
Fertility
Based on non-clinical findings, bosutinib has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility 
in humans (see section 5.3). Men being treated with bosutinib are advised to seek advice on 
conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of decreased fertility due to therapy 
with bosutinib.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Bosutinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, if a patient 
taking bosutinib experiences dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment or other undesirable effects with a 
potential impact on the ability to drive or use machines safely, the patient should refrain from these 
activities for as long as the undesirable effects persist.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of safety profile
A total of 1,372 leukaemia patients received at least 1 dose of single-agent bosutinib. The median 
duration of therapy was 26.30 months (range: 0.03 to 170.49 months). These patients were either 
newly-diagnosed, with CP CML or were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy with chronic, 
accelerated, or blast phase CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Of these patients,
268 (400 mg starting dose) and 248 (500 mg starting dose) are from the 2 Phase 3 studies in 
previously untreated CML patients, 60 (400 mg starting dose) are from a Phase 2 study in previously 
untreated CML patients, 570 and 63 (Phase 2: 500 mg starting dose) are from 2 Phase 1/2 studies in 
previously treated Ph+ leukaemias, and 163 (500 mg starting dose) are from a Phase 4 study in 
previously treated CML. The median duration of therapy was 55.1 months (range: 0. 2 to 
60.05 months), 61.6 months (0.03 to 145.86 months), 15.3 months (range: 0.3 to 21.8 months), 
11.1 months (range: 0.03 to 170.49 months), 30.2 months (range: 0.2 to 85.6 months), and 
37.80 months (range: 0.16 to 50.0 months), respectively. The safety analyses included data from a
completed extension study.  
At least 1 adverse reaction of any toxicity grade was reported for 1,349 (98.3%) patients. The most 
frequent adverse reactions reported for  20% of patients were diarrhoea (80.4%), nausea (41.5%), 
abdominal pain (35.6%), thrombocytopenia (34.4%), vomiting (33.7%), rash (32.8%), ALT increased 
(28.0%), anaemia (27.2%), pyrexia (23.4%), AST increased (22.5%), fatigue (32.0%), and headache 
(20.3%). At least 1 Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse reaction was reported for 943 (68.7%) patients. The 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse reactions reported for  5% of patients were thrombocytopenia (19.7%), 
ALT increased (14.6%), neutropenia (10.6%), diarrhoea (10.6%), anaemia (10.3%), lipase increased 
(10.1%), AST increased (6.7%), and rash (5.0%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were reported in patients in bosutinib clinical studies (Table 2). These 
represent an evaluation of the adverse reaction data from 1,372 patients with either newly-diagnosed 
CP CML or with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy or 
Ph+ ALL who have received at least 1 dose of single-agent bosutinib. These adverse reactions are 
presented by system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common 
( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare ( 1/10,000 to 
10
< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
The descriptions included below are based on the safety population of 1,372 patients who received at 
least 1 dose of bosutinib and had either newly-diagnosed CP CML or were resistant or intolerant to 
prior therapy with CP, AP, or BP CML, or Ph+ ALL.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders
Of the 372 (27.1%) patients with reports of adverse reactions of anaemia, 6 patients discontinued 
bosutinib due to anaemia. Maximum toxicity of Grade 1 occurred in 95 (25.5%) patients, Grade 2 in 
135 (36.3%) patients, Grade 3 in 113 patients (30.4%), and Grade 4 in 29 (7.8%) patients. Among 
these patients, the median time to first event was 29 days (range: 1 to 3,999 days) and the median 
duration per event was 22 days (range: 1 to 3,682 days). 
Of the 209 (15.2%) patients with reports of adverse reactions of neutropenia, 19 patients discontinued 
bosutinib due to neutropenia. Maximum toxicity of Grade 1 occurred in 19 patients (9.1%), Grade 2 in
45 (21.5%) patients, Grade 3 in 95 (45.5%) patients, and Grade 4 in 50 (23.9%) patients. Among these 
patients, the median time to first event was 56 days (range: 1 to 1,769 days), and the median duration 
per event was 15 days (range: 1 to 913 days).
Of the 472 (34.4%) patients with reports of adverse reactions of thrombocytopenia, 42 patients
discontinued bosutinib due to thrombocytopenia. Maximum toxicity of Grade 1 occurred in 
114 (24.2%) patients, Grade 2 in 88 (18.6%) patients, Grade 3 in 172 (36.4%) patients, and Grade 4 in
12
98 (20.8%) patients. Among these patients, the median time to first event was 28 days (range: 1 to
1,688 days), and median duration per event was 15 days (range: 1 to 3,921 days).
Hepatobiliary disorders
Among patients with reports of adverse reactions of elevations in either ALT or AST (all grades), the 
median time of onset observed was 29 days with a range of onset 1 to 3,995 days for ALT and AST.
The median duration of an event was 17 days (range: 1 to 1,148 days), and 15 days (range: 1 to 
803 days) for ALT and AST, respectively.
Two cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST 
≥ 3 × ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN and with alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN) without 
alternative causes have occurred in 2/1,711 (0.1%) subjects treated with bosutinib.
Hepatitis B reactivation
Hepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in 
acute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see 
section 4.4).
Gastrointestinal disorders
Of the 1,103 (80.4%) patients that experienced diarrhoea, 14 patients discontinued bosutinib due to
this event. Concomitant medicinal products were given to treat diarrhoea in 756 (68.5%) patients. 
Maximum toxicity of Grade 1 occurred in 575 (52.1%) patients, Grade 2 in 383 (34.7%) patients, 
Grade 3 in 144 (13.1%) patients; 1 patient (0.1%) experienced a Grade 4 event. Among patients with 
diarrhoea, the median time to first event was 2 days (range: 1 to 2,702 days) and the median duration 
of any grade of diarrhoea was 2 days (range: 1 to 4,247 days).
Among the 1,103 patients with diarrhoea, 218 patients (19.8%) were managed with treatment 
interruption and of these 208 (95.4%) were rechallenged with bosutinib. Of those who were 
rechallenged, 201 (96.6%) did not have a subsequent event or did not discontinue bosutinib due to a 
subsequent event of diarrhoea.
Cardiac disorders
Seven patients (0.5%) experienced QTcF prolongation (greater than 500 ms). Eleven (0.8%) patients
experienced QTcF increase > 60 ms from baseline. Patients with uncontrolled or significant 
cardiovascular disease including QTc prolongation, at baseline, were not included in clinical studies
(see sections 5.1 and 5.3).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Experience with bosutinib overdose in clinical studies was limited to isolated cases. Patients who take 
an overdose of bosutinib should be observed and given appropriate supportive treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EA04.
Mechanism of action
Bosutinib belongs to a pharmacological class of medicinal products known as kinase inhibitors. 
Bosutinib inhibits the abnormal BCR-ABL kinase that promotes CML. Modelling studies indicate that 
bosutinib binds the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Bosutinib is also an inhibitor of Src family kinases 
including Src, Lyn and Hck. Bosutinib minimally inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
receptor and c-Kit.
In in vitro studies, bosutinib inhibits proliferation and survival of established CML cell lines, 
Ph+ ALL cell lines, and patient-derived primary primitive CML cells. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of 
18 imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib treatment 
reduced the size of CML tumours growing in nude mice and inhibited growth of murine myeloid 
tumours expressing imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL. Bosutinib also inhibits receptor tyrosine 
kinases c-Fms, EphA and B receptors, Trk family kinases, Axl family kinases, Tec family kinases, 
some members of the ErbB family, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Csk, serine/threonine kinases of 
the Ste20 family, and 2 calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.
Pharmacodynamic effects
The effect of bosutinib 500 mg administration on corrected QTc was evaluated in a randomised, 
single-dose, double-blind (with respect to bosutinib), crossover, placebo- and open-label 
moxifloxacin-controlled study in healthy subjects.
The data from this study indicate that bosutinib does not prolong the QTc in healthy subjects at the 
dose of 500 mg daily with food, and under conditions that give rise to supratherapeutic plasma 
concentrations. Following administration of a single oral dose of bosutinib 500 mg (therapeutic dose) 
and bosutinib 500 mg with ketoconazole 400 mg (to achieve supratherapeutic concentrations of 
bosutinib) in healthy subjects, the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) around the 
mean change in QTc was less than 10 ms at all post-dose time points, and no adverse events 
suggestive of QTc prolongation were observed.
In a study in liver impaired subjects, an increasing frequency of QTc prolongation > 450 ms with 
declining hepatic function was observed. In the Phase 1/2 clinical study in patients with previously 
treated Ph+ leukaemias treated with bosutinib 500 mg, QTcF increase > 60 ms from baseline was 
observed in 9 (1.6%) of 570 patients. In the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with newly-diagnosed 
CP CML treated with bosutinib 400 mg, there were no patients in the bosutinib treatment group
(N=268) with a QTcF increase of > 60 ms from baseline. In the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with 
newly-diagnosed Ph+ CP CML treated with bosutinib 500 mg, QTcF increase > 60 ms from baseline 
was observed in 2 (0.8%) of 248 patients receiving bosutinib. In the Phase 4 clinical study in patients 
with Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s) treated with bosutinib 500 mg (N=163), there 
were no patients with a QTcF increase > 60 ms from baseline. A proarrhythmic potential of bosutinib 
cannot be ruled out.
Clinical efficacy
Clinical study in CP previously untreated CML
Bosutinib 400 mg study
A 2-arm, Phase 3, open-label, multicentre superiority trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of bosutinib 400 mg once daily alone compared with imatinib 400 mg once daily alone in 
adult patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CP CML. The trial randomised 536 patients (268 in each 
treatment group) with Ph+ or Ph- newly-diagnosed CP CML (intent-to-treat population [ITT]) 
14
including 487 patients with Ph+ CML harbouring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts and baseline 
BCR-ABL copies > 0 (modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population).
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion demonstrating a major molecular response (MMR) 
at 12 months (48 weeks) in the bosutinib treatment group compared with that in the imatinib treatment 
group in the mITT population. MMR was defined as ≤ 0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by international 
scale (corresponding to ≥ 3 log reduction from standardised baseline) with a minimum of 3,000 ABL
transcripts as assessed by the central laboratory. 
Key secondary endpoints included complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months, duration of 
CCyR, duration of MMR, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). CCyR by Month 12, 
was defined as the absence of Ph+ metaphases in chromosome banding analysis of ≥ 20 metaphases 
derived from bone marrow aspirate or MMR if an adequate cytogenetic assessment was unavailable. 
The p-values for endpoints other than MMR at 12 months and CCyR by 12 months have not been 
adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Baseline characteristics for the mITT population were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups 
with respect to age (median age was 52 years for the bosutinib group and 53 years for the imatinib 
group with 19.5% and 17.4% of patients 65 years of age or older, respectively); gender (women 42.3% 
and 44.0%, respectively); race (Caucasian 78.0% and 77.6%, Asian 12.2% and 12.4%, Black or 
African American 4.1% and 4.1%, and Other 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively, and 1 unknown in the 
imatinib group); and Sokal risk score (low risk 35.0% and 39.4%, intermediate risk 43.5% and 38.2%, 
high risk 21.5% and 22.4%, respectively).
After 60 months of follow-up in the mITT population, 60.2% of patients treated with bosutinib 
(N=246) and 59.8% of patients treated with imatinib (N=239) were still receiving first-line treatment.
After 60 months of follow-up in the mITT population, discontinuations due to disease progression to 
AP or BP CML for bosutinib-treated patients were 0.8% compared to 1.7% for imatinib-treated 
patients. Six (2.4%) bosutinib patients and 7 (2.9%) imatinib patients transformed to AP CML or 
BP CML. Discontinuations due to suboptimal response or treatment failure as assessed by the 
investigator occurred for 5.3% of patients in the bosutinib-treated group compared to 15.5% of 
patients in the imatinib-treated group. Twelve (4.9%) patients on bosutinib and 14 (5.8%) patients on 
imatinib died while on study. No additional transformations occurred in the ITT population, there were 
2 additional deaths in the bosutinib arm in the ITT population.

The cumulative incidence of CCyR adjusted for the competing risk of treatment discontinuation 
without CCyR was higher in the bosutinib treatment group compared to the imatinib treatment group 
in the mITT population (83.3% [95% CI: 78.1%, 87.4%] versus 76.8% [95% CI: 70.9%, 81.6%] at 
Month 60; hazard ratio [HR] from a stratified proportional sub distributional hazards model: 1.35, 
[95% CI: 1.11, 1.64]). The median time to CCyR (responders only) was 24.0 weeks (range: 11.4 to 
120.7) in the bosutinib group compared to the 24.3 weeks (range: 11.4 to 96.6) in the imatinib group.
The median time to MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 (responders only) was 36.1 weeks (range: 11.9 to 241.9),
83.7 weeks (range: 12.4 to 244.3), and 108.0 weeks (range: 24.1 to 242.1), respectively, for the 
bosutinib treatment group versus 47.7 weeks (range: 12.1 to 216.1), 84.4 weeks (range: 23.6 to 241.9), 
and 120.4 weeks (range: 24.6 to 240.7), respectively, for the imatinib treatment group in the mITT 
population.
The cumulative incidence of MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 adjusted for the competing risk of treatment 
discontinuation without the event was higher with bosutinib compared to imatinib as shown in 
Figures 1 to 3.

In the mITT population, among patients who achieved CCyR, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 
maintaining a response at Year 4 was 97.4% (95% CI: 93.9%, 98.9%) and 93.7% (95% CI: 88.9%, 
96.5%) in the bosutinib and imatinib groups (HR 0.39 [95% CI: 0.14, 1.13]), respectively. Among 
patients who achieved MMR, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of maintaining a response at Year 4 was 
92.2% (95% CI: 86.8%, 95.4%) and 92.0% (95% CI: 85.9%, 95.5%) in the bosutinib and imatinib 
groups (HR 1.09 [95% CI: 0.49, 2.44]), respectively.
By Month 60, 43.9% (95% CI: 37.7%, 50.1%) and 38.6% (95% CI: 32.4%, 44.7%) of bosutinib- and 
imatinib-treated patients (OR 1.24 [95% CI: 0.87, 1.78]) in the mITT population, respectively, had 
sustained MR4 defined by the following criteria: treatment for at least 3 years with at least MR4 at all 
assessments during a 1-year period.
The cumulative incidence of on-treatment EFS events at Month 60 in the mITT population was 6.9% 
(95% CI: 4.2%, 10.5%) in the bosutinib arm and 10.4% (95% CI: 6.9%, 14.6%) in the imatinib arm 
(HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.17).
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS at Month 60 for bosutinib and imatinib patients in the 
mITT population were 94.9% (95% CI: 91.1%, 97.0%) and 94.0% (95% CI: 90.1%, 96.4%), 
respectively (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.37, 1.73). 
In a retrospective analysis, among evaluable patients in the ITT population, more patients in the 
bosutinib arm 200/248 (80.6%) achieved early molecular response (BCR-ABL transcripts ≤ 10% at 
3 months) compared to patients in the imatinib arm 153/253 (60.5%), OR 2.72 (95% CI: 1.82, 4.08). 
MMR and EFS at Month 60 in bosutinib patients with and without early molecular response are

Fewer patients in the bosutinib arm [6 (2.4%) bosutinib and 12 (5.0%) imatinib] had newly detectable 
mutations at 60 months in the mITT population. 
Phase 1/2 Clinical study in imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML in CP, AP, and BP
A single-arm, Phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of bosutinib 500 mg once daily in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML with separate 
cohorts for chronic, accelerated, and blast phase disease previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) 
or more than 1 TKI (imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib).
There were 570 patients treated with bosutinib in this trial including CP CML patients previously 
treated with only 1 prior TKI (imatinib), CP CML patients previously treated with imatinib and at least 
1 additional TKI (dasatinib and/or nilotinib), CML patients in accelerated or blast phase previously
treated with at least 1 TKI (imatinib) and patients with Ph+ ALL previously treated with at least 1 TKI 
(imatinib).
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the major cytogenetic response (MCyR) rate at 
Week 24 in patients with imatinib-resistant CP CML previously treated with only 1 prior TKI 
(imatinib). Other efficacy endpoints include the cumulative cytogenetic and molecular response rates, 
time to and duration of cytogenetic and molecular responses, response in baseline mutations, 
transformation to AP/BP, progression free survival and OS for all cohorts.
Patients who were still receiving bosutinib at the end of the Phase 1/2 study and were benefiting from 
bosutinib treatment as judged by the investigator, as well as those patients who had already 
discontinued bosutinib as part of the Phase 1/2 study and were in long-term follow-up for survival or 
had completed the Phase 1/2 study, were eligible for enrollment into the extension study. Each patient
remained in the extension study, either on bosutinib treatment or in long-term survival follow-up, until 
the last patient reached 10 years of follow-up, as calculated from the date of his/her first dose of 
bosutinib administered in the Phase 1/2 study.  
Extension study efficacy endpoints included duration of cytogenetic and molecular responses, 
transformation to AP/BP, progression free survival, and OS.  
The efficacy analyses included data from this completed extension study.

Snapshot date: Phase 1/2 Study 02Oct2015, Extension Study 02Sep2020.
Cytogenetic Response criteria: MCyR included Complete [0% Ph+ metaphases from bone marrow or < 1% 
positive cells from fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH)] or partial (1%-35%) cytogenetic responses. 
Cytogenetic responses were based on the percentage of Ph+ metaphases among ≥ 20 metaphase cells in each bone 
marrow sample. FISH analysis (≥ 200 cells) could be used for post-baseline cytogenetic assessments if 
≥ 20 metaphases were not available. In the extension study, CCyR was imputed from MMR if a valid cytogenetic 
assessment was not available on a specific date.
Molecular response criteria: In the Phase 1/2 Study, MMR/MR4 was defined as ≤0.1/0.01% BCR-ABL transcripts 
as assessed by a central laboratory (not on the international scale). In the extension study, responders had 
MMR/MR4 denoted on the case report form as assessed by a local laboratory.

One patient with the E255V mutation previously treated with nilotinib achieved CHR as best response.
In vitro testing indicated that bosutinib had limited activity against the T315I or the V299L mutation.
Therefore, clinical activity in patients with these mutations is not expected. 
Phase 4 Clinical study in Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKI(s)
A single-arm, Phase 4 open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre study was conducted to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg once daily in patients with TKI-resistant or TKI-intolerant 
CML with separate cohorts for CP, AP or BP disease previously treated with 1 or more prior TKIs.
There were 163 patients treated with bosutinib in this trial including 46 patients with CP Ph+ CML 
and treated previously with 1 prior TKI (imatinib or dasatinib or nilotinib), 61 CP Ph+ CML patients 
previously treated with 2 prior TKIs (imatinib and/or dasatinib and/or nilotinib), 49 CP Ph+ CML 
patients treated with 3 prior TKIs (imatinib and dasatinib and nilotinib), 4 patients with AP Ph+ CML 
previously treated with at least 1 TKI (2 patients treated with 2 prior TKIs and 2 patients treated with 
3 prior TKIs) and 3 patients with Ph- CML treated with at least 1 prior TKI.
The primary efficacy endpoint was cumulative confirmed MCyR by 1 year (Week 52) in patients with 
CP Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or 2 prior TKIs and patients with CP Ph+ CML previously 
treated with 3 prior TKIs. For patients with AP and BP Ph+ CML with any prior TKI therapy, the 
primary efficacy endpoint was cumulative confirmed overall haematological response (OHR) by 
1 year (Week 52). Other efficacy endpoints in Ph+ CP CML patients include cumulative cytogenetic 
and molecular response, the duration of cytogenetic and molecular responses, response in baseline 
mutations, transformation to AP/BP, PFS, and OS. Additional endpoints in the Ph+ AP/BP cohort 
include cumulative cytogenetic and molecular responses rates, PFS and OS.
CP CML patients
The primary endpoint of cumulative confirmed MCyR (95% CI) rate by 1 year (52 weeks) was 
76.5% (66.9, 84.5) in patients treated with 1 or 2 prior TKIs and 62.2% (46.5, 76.2) in patients treated 
with 3 prior TKIs.
Additional efficacy results at study closure, after a minimum follow-up of 3 years, in Ph+ CP CML 
patients treated with 1 (median treatment duration 47.5 months (range: 0.9 to 50.1 months) and 
60.9% still on-treatment), 2 (median treatment duration 41.9 months (range: 0.4 to 48.9 months) and 
45.9% still on-treatment) and 3 (median treatment duration 20.0 months (range: 0.2 to 48.9 months) 
and 38.8% still on-treatment) prior TKIs are presented in Table 10.

CCyR=complete cytogenetic response; MMR=major molecular response; MR4=≥ 4 log-reduction in BCR-ABL 
transcripts from standardised baseline; MR4.5=≥ 4.5 log-reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts from standardised 
baseline.
Cumulative Confirmed MCyR criteria: Response is confirmed with 2 consecutive evaluations at least 28 days apart. 
To be considered a responder, the patient must have maintained a baseline response for at least 52 weeks or 
improved from baseline. Patients with partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at baseline must attain CCyR 
on-treatment to be counted as a cytogenetic responder. Patients with at least MMR and a deeper molecular response 
than baseline are counted as confirmed CCyR.
Cumulative Cytogenetic Response criteria: Major Cytogenetic Response included Complete [0% Ph+ metaphases 
from bone marrow or < 1% positive cells from fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH)] or partial (1%-35%) 
cytogenetic responses. Cytogenetic responses were based on the percentage of Ph+ metaphases among 
≥ 20 metaphase cells in each bone marrow sample. FISH analysis (≥ 200 cells) could be used to assess CCyR if 
≥ 20 metaphases were not available. Patients without a valid bone marrow or FISH assessment and with at least 
MMR are counted as CCyR. 
Cumulative Molecular Response criteria: MMR, MR4, and MR4.5 were defined as ≤ 0.1%, ≤ 0.01%, and ≤ 0.0032% 
BCR-ABL/ABL ratio on international scale, respectively (corresponding to ≥ 3, ≥ 4, and ≥ 4.5 log-reduction from 
standardised baseline) with a minimum of 10,000, 10,000, and 32,000 ABL transcripts assessed by the central 
laboratory, respectively.
a Includes patients (N) with a valid baseline assessment. Minimum follow-up time (time from last patient first dose to 
data snapshot date) of 36 months.
b Includes patients (N) who attained or maintained response.
The cumulative incidence of MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 adjusted for the competing risk of treatment 
discontinuation without the event are shown in Figure 5.

a Includes patients (N) with a valid baseline assessment. To be considered a responder, patients must have achieved 
an improved response from baseline. Molecular Response criteria: MMR, MR4, and MR4.5 were defined as ≤ 0.1%, 
≤ 0.01%, and ≤ 0.0032% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio on international scale, respectively (corresponding to ≥ 3, ≥ 4, and 
≥ 4.5 log-reduction from standardised baseline) with a minimum of 10,000, 10,000, and 32,000 ABL transcripts 
assessed by the central laboratory, respectively.
In CP patients, there were no on-treatment progressions to AP or BP CML.
AP CML patients
In patients with Ph+ AP CML, the median duration of treatment was 22.1 months (range: 1.6 to 
50.1 months), the cumulative confirmed OHR by 1 year (52 weeks) was 75.0% (95% CI: 19.4, 99.4), 
as was the cumulative CCyR rate, all 3 patients maintained their CCyR on treatment. 
Response by BCR-ABL Mutations at baseline
Ten patients in the CP cohort had mutations at baseline (A365V, E453K, E255K, E255V, 
Q252H, L298V [n=1 each], Y253F and G250E [n=2 each]). One patient in the CP cohort had 
a F359I mutation identified on study day 8. One patient in the AP cohort had 2 mutations 
(F311L and L387F) at baseline. In the CP cohort, among patients with mutations, molecular 
responses were observed in 4/11 (36.4%) patients, 1 patient with a E255V mutation achieved 
MMR and 3 patients with F359I, Y253F and A365V respectively achieved MR4.5. The patient 
with mutations in the AP cohort did not achieve any response.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with
Bosulif in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in CML (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use).

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Following administration of a single dose of bosutinib (500 mg) with food in healthy subjects, the 
absolute bioavailability was 34%. Absorption was relatively slow, with a median time-to-peak 
concentration (tmax) reached after 6 hours. Bosutinib exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and 
Cmax, over the dose range of 200 to 600 mg. Food increased bosutinib Cmax 1.8-fold and bosutinib 
AUC 1.7-fold compared to the fasting state. In CML patients at steady state, Cmax (geometric mean, 
coefficient of variation [CV]%) was 145 (14) ng/mL, and AUCss (geometric mean, CV%) was 
2,700 (16) ng•h/mL after daily administration of bosutinib at 400 mg with food. After 500 mg 
bosutinib daily with food, Cmax was 200 (6) ng/mL and AUCss was 3,640 (12) ng•h/mL. The solubility
of bosutinib is pH-dependent and absorption is reduced when gastric pH is increased (see section 4.5).
Distribution 
Following administration of a single intravenous dose of 120 mg bosutinib to healthy subjects, 
bosutinib had a mean (% coefficient of variation [CV]) volume of distribution of 2,331 (32) L, 
suggesting that bosutinib is extensively distributed to extra vascular tissue.
Bosutinib was highly bound to human plasma proteins in vitro (94%) and ex vivo in healthy subjects 
(96%), and binding was not concentration-dependent.
Biotransformation
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that bosutinib (parent compound) undergoes predominantly 
hepatic metabolism in humans. Following administration of single or multiple doses of bosutinib
(400 or 500 mg) to humans, the major circulating metabolites appeared to be oxydechlorinated (M2) 
and N-desmethylated (M5) bosutinib, with bosutinib N-oxide (M6) as a minor circulating metabolite. 
The systemic exposure of N-desmethylated metabolite was 25% of the parent compound, while the 
oxydechlorinated metabolite was 19% of the parent compound. All 3 metabolites exhibited activity 
that was  5% that of bosutinib in a Src-transformed fibroblast anchorage-independent proliferation 
assay. In faeces, bosutinib and N-desmethyl bosutinib were the major drug-related components. 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that the major cytochrome P450 isozyme
involved in the metabolism of bosutinib is CYP3A4 and drug interaction studies have shown that 
ketoconazole and rifampicin had marked effect on the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib (see section 4.5). 
No metabolism of bosutinib was observed with CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 
3A5. 
Elimination
In healthy subjects given a single intravenous dose of 120 mg bosutinib, the mean (%CV) terminal 
elimination half-life was 35.5 (24) hours, and the mean (%CV) clearance was 61.9 (26) L/h. In a 
mass-balance study with oral bosutinib, an average of 94.6% of the total dose was recovered in 9 days; 
faeces (91.3%) was the major route of excretion, with 3.29% of the dose recovered in urine.
Seventy-five percent of the dose was recovered within 96 hours. Excretion of unchanged bosutinib in 
urine was low with approximately 1% of the dose in both healthy subjects and those with advanced 
malignant solid tumours.
Special populations
Hepatic impairment
A 200 mg dose of bosutinib administered with food was evaluated in a cohort of 18 hepatically 
impaired subjects (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) and 9 matched healthy subjects. Cmax of bosutinib 
in plasma increased 2.4-fold, 2-fold, and 1.5-fold, respectively, in Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C; and 
bosutinib AUC in plasma increased 2.3-fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively. The t½ of bosutinib 
increased in hepatic impaired patients as compared to the healthy subjects. 
29
Renal impairment
In a renal impairment study, a single dose of 200 mg bosutinib was administered with food to 
26 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and to 8 matching healthy volunteers. 
Renal impairment was based on CLCr (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) of < 30 mL/min 
(severe renal impairment), 30  CLCr  50 mL/min (moderate renal impairment), or 
50 < CLCr  80 mL/min (mild renal impairment). Subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment 
had an increase in AUC over healthy volunteers of 35% and 60%, respectively. Maximal exposure 
Cmax increased by 28% and 34% in the moderate and severe groups, respectively. Bosutinib exposure 
was not increased in subjects with mild renal impairment. The elimination half-life of bosutinib in 
subjects with renal impairment was similar to that in healthy subjects.
Dose adjustments for renal impairment were based on the results of this study, and the known linear 
pharmacokinetics of bosutinib in the dose range of 200 to 600 mg.
Age, gender and race
No formal studies have been performed to assess the effects of these demographic factors. Population 
pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with Ph+ leukaemia or malignant solid tumour and in healthy 
subjects indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender or body weight. Population 
pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that Asians had a 18% lower clearance corresponding to an 
approximately 25% increase in bosutinib exposure (AUC).
Paediatric population
Bosulif has not yet been studied in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Bosutinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, 
reproductive toxicity, and phototoxicity studies.
Safety pharmacology
Bosutinib did not have effects on respiratory functions. In a study of the central nervous system 
(CNS), bosutinib treated rats displayed decreased pupil size and impaired gait. A no observed effect 
level (NOEL) for pupil size was not established, but the NOEL for impaired gait occurred at exposures 
approximately 11-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 8-times 
the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound Cmax in the 
respective species). Bosutinib activity in vitro in hERG assays suggested a potential for prolongation 
of cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QTc). In an oral study of bosutinib in dogs, bosutinib did not 
produce changes in blood pressure, abnormal atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or prolongation of the 
PR, QRS, or QTc of the ECG at exposures up to 3-times the human exposure resulting from the 
clinical dose of 400 mg and 2-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg 
(based on unbound Cmax in the respective species). A delayed increase in heart rate was observed. In an 
intravenous study in dogs, transient increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure and 
minimal prolongation of the QTc (< 10 msec) were observed at exposures ranging from approximately
6-times to 20-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 4-times to 
15-times the human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound Cmax in the 
respective species). The relationship between the observed effects and medicinal product treatment 
were inconclusive.
Repeated-dose toxicity
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats of up to 6 months in duration and in dogs up to 9 months in 
duration revealed the gastrointestinal system to be the primary target organ of toxicity of bosutinib. 
Clinical signs of toxicity included foecal changes and were associated with decreased food 
consumption and body weight loss which occasionally led to death or elective euthanasia. 
Histopathologically, luminal dilation, goblet cell hyperplasia, haemorrhage, erosion, and oedema of 
the intestinal tract, and sinus erythrocytosis and haemorrhage in the mesenteric lymph nodes, were 
30
observed. The liver was also identified as a target organ in rats. Toxicities were characterised by an 
increase in liver weights in correlation with hepatocellular hypertrophy which occurred in the absence 
of elevated liver enzymes or microscopic signs of hepatocellular cytotoxicity, and is of unknown 
relevance to humans. The exposure comparison across species indicates that exposures that did not 
elicit adverse events in the 6- and 9-month toxicity studies in rats and dogs, respectively, were similar 
to the human exposure resulting from a clinical dose of 400 mg or 500 mg (based on unbound AUC in 
the respective species).
Genotoxicity
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with 
and without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of bosutinib.
Reproductive toxicity and development toxicity
In a rat fertility study, fertility was slightly decreased in males. Females were observed with increased 
embryonic resorptions, and decreases in implantations and viable embryos. The dose at which no 
adverse reproductive effects were observed in males (30 mg/kg/day) and females (3 mg/kg/day) 
resulted in exposures equal to 0.6-times and 0.3-times, respectively, the human exposure resulting 
from the clinical dose of 400 mg, and 0.5-times and 0.2-times, respectively, the human exposure 
resulting from the clinical dose of 500 mg (based on unbound AUC in the respective species). An 
effect on male fertility cannot be excluded (see section 4.6).
Foetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental 
transfer study in gravid Sprague-Dawley rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, there 
were reduced number of pups born at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, and increased incidence of total litter loss and 
decreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day. The dose at which no adverse 
development effects were observed (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in exposures equal to 1.3-times and 
1.0-times human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg and 500 mg, respectively (based 
on unbound AUC in the respective species). In a rabbit developmental toxicity study at the maternally 
toxic dose, there were foetal anomalies observed (fused sternebrae, and 2 foetuses had various visceral 
observations), and a slight decrease in foetal body weight. The exposure at the highest dose tested in 
rabbits (10 mg/kg/day) that did not result in adverse foetal effects was 0.9-times and 0.7-times the 
human exposure resulting from the clinical dose of 400 mg or 500 mg, respectively (based on unbound 
AUC in the respective species).
Following a single oral (10 mg/kg) administration of [14C] radiolabelled bosutinib to lactating 
Sprague-Dawley rats, radioactivity was readily excreted into breast milk as early as 0.5 hr after dosing. 
Concentration of radioactivity in milk was up to 8-fold higher than in plasma. This allowed 
measurable concentrations of radioactivity to appear in the plasma of nursing pups.
Carcinogenicity
Bosutinib was not carcinogenic in the 2-year rat and 6-month rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity studies.
Phototoxicity
Bosutinib has demonstrated the ability to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range and is distributed 
into the skin and uveal tract of pigmented rats. However, bosutinib did not demonstrate a potential for
phototoxicity of the skin or eyes in pigmented rats exposed to bosutinib in the presence of 
UV radiation at bosutinib exposures up to 3-times and 2-times the human exposure resulting from the 
clinical dose of 400 or 500 mg, respectively (based on unbound Cmax in the respective species).

Content of the pack and other information
1. What Bosulif is and what it is used for
Bosulif contains the active substance bosutinib. It is used to treat adult patients who have a type of 
leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
(CML) and are newly-diagnosed or for whom previous medicines to treat CML have either not worked 
or are not suitable. Ph-positive CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many 
of a specific type of white blood cell called granulocytes.
If you have any questions about how Bosulif works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor.
2. What do you need to know before you take Bosulif
Do not take Bosulif
-
if you are allergic to bosutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if your doctor has told you that your liver has been damaged and is not working normally.
-
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Bosulif:
-
if you have, or have had in the past, liver problems. Tell your doctor if you have a history of 
liver problems including hepatitis (liver infection or inflammation) of any kind, or a history of 
any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark 
urine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. Your doctor should do blood tests 
to check your liver function prior to your starting treatment with Bosulif and for the first 
3 months of treatment with Bosulif, and as clinically indicated.
-
if you have diarrhoea and vomiting. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs 
and symptoms: an increase in the number of stools (bowel movements) per day over normal, an 
48
increase in episodes of vomiting, blood in your vomit, stools (bowel movements) or urine, or 
have black stools (tarry black bowel movements). You should ask your doctor if use of your 
treatment for vomiting may result in a greater risk of heart arrhythmias. In particular, you should 
ask your doctor if you want to use a medicine containing domperidone for the treatment of 
nausea and/or vomiting. Treatment of nausea or vomiting with such medicines together with 
Bosulif may result in a greater risk of dangerous heart arrhythmias.
if you suffer from bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following 
signs and symptoms such as abnormal bleeding or bruising without having an injury.
if you have an infection. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and 
symptoms such as fever, problems with urine such as burning on urination, a new cough, or a 
new sore throat.
if you have fluid retention. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and 
symptoms of fluid retention during Bosulif treatment such as swelling of the ankles, feet or legs; 
difficulty breathing chest pain or a cough (these may be signs of fluid retention in the lungs or 
chest).
if you have heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as arrhythmias 
or an abnormal electrical signal called “prolongation of the QT interval”. This is always 
important, but especially if you are experiencing frequent or prolonged diarrhoea as described 
above. If you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heartbeat while taking Bosulif,
tell your doctor immediately, as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition.
if you have been told that you have problems with your kidneys. Tell your doctor if you are 
urinating more frequently and producing larger amounts of urine with a pale colour or if you are 
urinating less frequently and producing smaller amounts of urine with a dark colour. Also tell 
your doctor if you are losing weight or have experienced swelling of your feet, ankles, legs, 
hands or face. 
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Bosulif
could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will 
be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.
if you have or have had pancreas problems. Tell your doctor if you develop abdominal pain 
or discomfort.
if you have any of these symptoms: serious skin rashes. Tell your doctor if you develop any 
of the following signs and symptoms of painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters 
and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g., mouth and lips). 
if you notice any of these symptoms: pain in your side, blood in your urine or reduced 
amount of urine. When your disease is very severe, your body may not be able to clear all the 
waste products from the dying cancer cells. This is called tumour lysis syndrome and can cause 
kidney failure and heart problems within 48 hours of the first dose of Bosulif. Your doctor will 
be aware of this and may ensure you are adequately hydrated and give you other medicines to 
help prevent it.

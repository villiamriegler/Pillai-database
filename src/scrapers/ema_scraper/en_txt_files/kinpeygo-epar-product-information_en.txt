CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kinpeygo is indicated for the treatment of primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) in adults at 
risk of rapid disease progression with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/gram.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 16 mg once daily in the morning, at least one hour before a meal, for 9 months. 
When treatment is to be discontinued, the dose should be reduced to 8 mg once daily for 2 weeks of therapy; 
the dose may be reduced to 4 mg once daily for an additional 2 weeks, at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
Re-treatment may be considered at the discretion of the treating physician. Safety and efficacy of treatment 
with subsequent courses of Kinpeygo have not been established.  
If the patient forgets to take Kinpeygo, the patient should take Kinpeygo the next day, in the morning as usual. 
The patient should not double the daily dose to make up for a missed dose.  
Special populations 
Elderly

Experience of the use of Kinpeygo in the elderly is limited. However, from the clinical data available, the 
efficacy and safety of Kinpeygo are expected to be similar to that of other age groups studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of Kinpeygo capsules in patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied.  
Kinpeygo is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). See section 4.3, 
4.4 and 5.2.  
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of budesonide are not expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kinpeygo capsules in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet 
been established. No data are available.  
Method of administration  
Kinpeygo is for oral use. The modified-release hard capsules should be swallowed whole with water in the 
morning, at least 1 hour before a meal (see section 5.2). The capsules must not be opened, crushed or chewed, 
as it could affect the release profile.     
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression 
When glucocorticosteroids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal 
suppression may occur. Glucocorticosteroids can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, 
supplementation with a systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended. 
Since Kinpeygo contains a glucocorticosteroid, general warnings concerning glucocorticosteroids, as given 
below, should be followed. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C respectively) could be at an 
increased risk of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression due to an increased systemic exposure of oral 
budesonide. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be monitored for 
increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism. 
Symptoms of steroid withdrawal in patients transferred from systemic corticosteroids 
Patients who are transferred from glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic availability to 
glucocorticosteroids with lower systemic availability, such as budesonide, should be monitored since 
symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal axis suppression or 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these 
patients and the dose of glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously. 
Replacement of systemic glucocorticosteroids with budesonide may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and 
eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic medicinal product. 
Infections 
Patients who are on medicinal products that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than 
healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in 
susceptible patients or patients on immunosuppressant doses of glucocorticosteroids. In patients who have not 
had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. 
How the dose, route, and duration of glucocorticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a 
disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior 
glucocorticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, therapy with varicella 
zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be 
indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be 
indicated. (See Summaries of Product Characteristics for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment 
with antiviral agents may be considered. 
Glucocorticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis 
infection, untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. 
Caution with special diseases 
Patients with infections, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or 
with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where use of glucocorticosteroids 
may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, should be monitored. 
Visual disturbance  
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical glucocorticosteroid use. If a patient presents with 
symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an 
ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such 
as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical 
glucocorticosteroids. 
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors  
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, including ketoconazole and cobicistat-containing 
products, is expected to increase the risk of systemic side effects attributable to budesonide. The combination 
should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic glucocorticosteroid side effects. 
If this is not possible, the period between treatments should be as long as possible and a reduction of the 
budesonide dose to 8 mg budesonide daily could also be considered (see section 4.5). 
After extensive intake of grapefruit juice (which inhibits CYP3A4 activity predominantly in the intestinal 
mucosa), the systemic exposure to budesonide after oral administration increased approximately two-fold. As 
with other medicinal products primarily metabolised through CYP3A4, regular ingestion of grapefruit or its 
juice should be avoided in connection with Kinpeygo administration (other juices such as orange juice or apple 
juice do not inhibit CYP3A4). See also section 4.5. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACTH stimulation test 
Because adrenal function may be suppressed, an ACTH stimulation test for diagnosing pituitary insufficiency 
might show false results (low values). 
Sucrose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-
isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal products/substances inhibiting CYP3A4 
Budesonide is metabolised via CYP3A4.  Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 can increase plasma levels of 
budesonide. Co-administration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole or intake of grapefruit juice 
resulted in a 6.5-fold and 2-fold increase, respectively in the bioavailability of budesonide, compared to 
budesonide alone. 
Thus, clinically relevant interactions with potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, cyclosporine, and grapefruit juice, are to be expected, and may 
increase systemic budesonide concentrations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Medicinal products/substances inducing CYP3A4 
Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine may reduce budesonide systemic 
exposure. 
Medicinal products/substances metabolised by CYP3A4 
Given its low affinity for CYP3A4 and P-gp, as well as the formulation, pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics 
and low systemic exposure, Kinpeygo is unlikely to affect the systemic exposure of other medicinal products. 
Oral contraceptives  
Oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol, which are also metabolised by CYP3A4, do not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of budesonide. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
The pharmacokinetics of budesonide have not been evaluated in combination with proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs). In a study assessing intragastric and intraduodenal pH in healthy volunteers after repeated dosing with 
the PPI omeprazole 40 mg once daily, intragastric and intraduodenal pH did not exceed that required for 
disintegration of Kinpeygo. Beyond the duodenum, PPIs such as omeprazole are unlikely to affect pH. 
Other interactions to be considered 
Budesonide treatment may reduce serum potassium, which should be considered when Kinpeygo is co-
administered with a medicinal product where the pharmacological effects may be potentiated by low serum 
potassium, such as cardiac glucosides, or when co-administered with diuretics that lower serum potassium. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Administration during pregnancy should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for therapy with 
Kinpeygo. There are only few data of pregnancy outcomes after oral administration of budesonide in 
humans. Although data on the use of inhaled budesonide in a large number of exposed pregnancies 
indicate no adverse effect, the maximal concentration of budesonide in plasma is expected to be higher in 
association with treatment with Kinpeygo compared to inhaled budesonide. In pregnant animals 
budesonide, like other glucocorticosteroids, has been shown to cause abnormalities of fetal development 
(see section 5.3). The relevance of this to man has not been established.  
Therefore, Kinpeygo should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with budesonide. The expected benefits for the pregnant woman have to be weighed 
against the potential risk for the fetus.  
Budesonide was found to cross the placental barrier. The relevance of this observation to humans has not 
been established.   
Hypoadrenalism may occur in neonates exposed to glucocorticosteroids in utero; carefully observe 
neonates for signs and symptoms of hypoadrenalism. 
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. 
Lactation studies have not been conducted with oral budesonide, including Kinpeygo, and no information is 
available on the effects of the medicinal product on the breast-fed infant or the effects of the medicinal product 
on milk production. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded. 
If Kinpeygo is used when a mother is breast-feeding, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue/abstain from budesonide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of budesonide on human fertility. There were no effects on fertility in rats after 
treatment with budesonide. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects of Kinpeygo on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. It is 
expected that Kinpeygo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the Kinpeygo phase 3 clinical study the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions were acne reported 
in approximately 10% of patients, hypertension, peripheral oedema, face oedema, and dyspepsia, each 
occurring in approximately 5% of patients; these were mainly of mild or moderate severity and reversible, 
reflecting the low systemic exposure to budesonide after oral administration.

FBG≥100 mg/dL). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Potential class effects 
Adverse drug reactions typical of systemic glucocorticosteroids may occur (e.g., cushingoid features, increased 
blood pressure, increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, reduced glucose tolerance, sodium retention 
with oedema formation, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, glaucoma, mental disorders, peptic ulcer, increased risk 
of thrombosis). These adverse drug reactions are dependent on dose, treatment time, concomitant and previous 
glucocorticosteroid intake, and individual sensitivity. Not all of these adverse reactions were observed in the 
clinical study program of Kinpeygo. 
Paediatric population 
No data available.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reports of acute toxicity or death following overdose of glucocorticosteroids are rare. Acute overdose, even in 
excessive doses, is not expected to lead to clinically significant consequences. In the event of acute overdose, 
no specific antidote is available. Treatment consists supportive and symptomatic therapy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, corticosteroids 
acting locally, ATC code: A07EA06 
Mechanism of action 
The intended action of Kinpeygo is the suppression of mucosal B-cells, located in the Peyer’s patches in the 
ileum, and inhibition of their proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that produce mucosal galactose-
deficient IgA1 antibodies (Gd-IgA1). Consequently, it is expected that the occurrence of Gd-IgA1 antibodies 
and formation of immune complexes in the systemic circulation will be suppressed, therefore preventing the 
downstream effects of glomerular mesangial deposition of immune complexes containing Gd-IgA1, 
manifesting as glomerulonephritis and loss of renal function.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Kinpeygo is an oral, modified-release hard capsule formulation of budesonide which combines a delayed 
capsule disintegration with a prolonged release of the active substance budesonide in the ileum. By directing 
the release of budesonide to the ileum, where Peyer’s patches reside in high density, a local pharmacological 
effect is anticipated.    
Clinical efficacy 
Primary IgA nephropathy 
The efficacy of Kinpeygo has been evaluated in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 
patients with primary IgAN, who were receiving Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitor therapy. In both 
studies the primary endpoint evaluated proteinuria reduction by urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) at 
9 months compared to baseline, with key secondary endpoint analyses of renal function based on estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 9 and 12 months. 
In 199 of the first 201 patients randomised who have completed part A of a phase 3 study,  
patients treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant 27% 
reduction in UPCR compared to placebo in the overall study population (p=0.0003) after 9 months of 
treatment.  UPCR at 9 months was reduced from baseline by 31% in patients treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg 
once-daily compared with 5% in placebo-treated patients. After 3 months of observational follow up without 
treatment, the reduction in UPCR improved to 48% compared to placebo at 1 year (p<0.0001).  
Consistent with the assessment of proteinuria reduction by UPCR, a 31% reduction in urine albumin creatinine 
ratio (UACR) compared to placebo was observed at 9 months (p=0.0005), and a 54% reduction in UACR at 
12 months (p<0.0001).  
After 9 months of treatment, Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily provided a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant 7% treatment benefit on eGFR CKD-EPI (serum creatinine) compared to placebo (p=0.0014). This 
3.87 mL/min/1.73 m2 treatment benefit at 9 months corresponded to a slight reduction from baseline of 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.17 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients who received Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily and a deterioration from baseline of 
4.04 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients who received placebo.    
The improvement in 1-year eGFR slope was 3.37 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily 
compared to placebo (p=0.0111).  
The effect of Kinpeygo treatment on stabilisation of the rate of loss of renal function was greater in patients 
with higher baseline proteinuria compared to the overall population. In patients with baseline 
UPCR≥1.5 g/gram, the improvement in 1-year eGFR chronic slope (from 3 months onwards) was 
7.62 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily compared to placebo (p=0.0068), and the 
corresponding improvement in 1-year eGFR total slope was 9.31 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (p=0.0005). 
A supportive phase 2b study with a similar study design was conducted in a total of 153 randomised patients 
who received Kinpeygo 16 mg, Kinpeygo 8 mg, or placebo, once daily for 9 months, while continuing to 
receive RAS inhibitor therapy.  
The primary objective was met at an interim analysis that compared Kinpeygo to placebo, and showed a 
statistically significant reduction in UPCR at 9 months for the combined Kinpeygo 16 mg/day and 8 mg/day 
dose groups compared to placebo (p=0.0066).   
Using the same statistical methodology as in the phase 3 study, a statistically significant 26% reduction in the 
primary endpoint UPCR was shown at 9 months for the 16 mg dose of Kinpeygo versus placebo (p=0.0100) 
and a 29% reduction at 12 months (p=0.0027).   
The difference in eGFR CKD-EPI (serum creatinine) for the 16 mg dose of Kinpeygo versus placebo was 
3.57 mL/min/1.73m2 at 9 months (p=0.0271), and 4.46 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 12 months (p=0.0256). The 
improvement in 1-year eGFR slope was estimated to be 5.69 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year with Kinpeygo 16 mg 
once daily compared to placebo (p=0.0007). 
Paediatric population 
Kinpeygo has not been studied in the paediatric population. 
Conditional approval 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that 
further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.The European Medicines Agency will review new 
information on the product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The Kinpeygo formulation is designed to deliver budesonide topically in the ileum. Oral absorption of 
budesonide seems to be complete and is rapid, whereas systemic bioavailability due to high first-pass 
metabolism is low (approximately 10%). 
Following single oral administration of Kinpeygo 16 mg to healthy subjects, the geometric mean Cmax ranged 
between 3.2 and 4.4 ng/mL, and AUC(0-24) ranged between 24.1 and 24.8 ng/mL×h. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no clinically relevant food effect observed on the overall systemic exposure of budesonide when 
either a moderate or high fat meal was consumed 1 hour after dosing. 
Distribution 
Budesonide is rapidly and extensively distributed into tissues and organs. Approximately 85 to 90% of 
budesonide binds to plasma proteins in blood over the concentration range of 1 to 100 nmol/L. The volume of 
distribution at steady state is 3 to 4 L/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Budesonide is rapidly metabolised by the liver (and to lesser extent the gut), primarily by oxidative pathways 
via CYP3A4 to two main metabolites, 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide, which have less 
than 1% of the glucocorticosteroid receptor affinity and anti-inflammatory activity of budesonide. 
The metabolism of budesonide is 2- to 5-fold faster than that of hydrocortisone and 8- to 15-fold faster than 
that of prednisolone.   
Elimination 
Budesonide has a high clearance rate of approximately 72 to 80 L/h, which is close to the estimated liver blood 
flow, and, accordingly, suggests that budesonide is a high hepatic clearance medicinal product.  
T½ for budesonide after dosing with Kinpeygo ranged from 5 to 6.8 hours in healthy volunteer studies. 
Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. The major metabolites, including 
16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide, are mainly renally excreted, intact or in conjugated 
forms. No unchanged budesonide was detected in urine. 
Hepatic impairment  
Budesonide is predominantly metabolised by hepatic biotransformation.  
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), systemic availability of orally 
administered budesonide was 3.5-fold higher (27%) compared with healthy volunteers (systemic availability 
7.4%); there was no clinically relevant increase in systemic availability in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class A).  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. 
Renal impairment 
Intact budesonide is not excreted renally. The main metabolites of budesonide, which have negligible 
glucocorticosteroid activity, are largely (60%) excreted in urine.  
Paediatric population 
Kinpeygo was not studied in the paediatric population. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The preclinical safety of budesonide has been documented in studies during the development of other 
formulations of this compound. No preclinical studies have been conducted with the Kinpeygo formulation 
itself.   
Results from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies show that the systemic effects of budesonide, e.g. 
decreased body-weight gain and atrophy of lymphoid tissues and adrenal cortex, are less severe or similar to 
those observed after administration of other glucocorticosteroids.  
Budesonide, evaluated in six different test systems, did not show any signs of mutagenic or clastogenic effects.  
An increased incidence of brain gliomas in male rats in a carcinogenicity study could not be verified in a repeat 
study, in which the incidence of gliomas did not differ between any of the groups on active treatment 
(budesonide, prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide) and the control group.  
Liver changes (primary hepatocellular neoplasms) found in male rats in the original carcinogenicity study were 
noted again in the repeat study with budesonide, as well as the reference glucocorticosteroids. These effects are 
most probably related to a receptor effect and thus represent a class effect in this species.  
Available clinical experience shows that there are no indications that budesonide or other glucocorticosteroids 
induce brain gliomas or primary hepatocellular neoplasms in humans. 
Budesonide had no effect on fertility in rats. In pregnant animals, budesonide, like other glucocorticoids, has 
been shown to caues foetal death and abnormalities of foetal development (smaller litter size, intrauterine 
growth retardation of foetuses and skeletal abnormalities). The clinical relevance of these findings to human 
has not been established (see section 4.6). 
The toxicity of budesonide modified-release hard capsules, with focus on the gastro-intestinal tract, has been 
studied in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 5 mg/kg (approximately 15 times the recommended daily 
dose of Kinpeygo in humans on a dose per body weight basis) after repeated oral administration for up to 
6 months. No effects were observed in the gastrointestinal tract, either from gross pathology or 
histopathological examination.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Following intravenous injection of methylnaltrexone 
bromide, juvenile rats were found to be more sensitive 
than adult rats to methylnaltrexone-related toxicity. In 
juvenile rats administered intravenous methylnaltrexone 
bromide for 13 weeks, adverse clinical signs (incidences of 
convulsions and laboured breathing) occurred at dosages (? 
3 mg/kg/day) and exposures (5.4 times the exposure 
[AUC] in adult humans at a subcutaneous dose of 0.15 
mg/kg) that were lower than those that caused similar 
toxicity in adult rats (20 mg/kg/day). No adverse effects 
occurred in juvenile rats at 1 mg/kg/day or in adult rats at 
5 mg/kg/day (1.6 times and 7.8 times, respectively, the 
exposure [AUC] in adult humans at a subcutaneous dose of

methylnaltrexone bromide at 20 mg/kg/day, clinical signs 
indicative of CNS toxicity and prolongation of QTc interval 
were observed. No adverse effects occurred in either

Summary of Product Characteristics to add 
Labelling and 
event "hyperhidrosis" was reported with a higher rate 
"hyperhidrosis" based on results of study 3200K1-

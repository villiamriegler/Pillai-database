2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which 
weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake and has no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, 
cholinergic or adrenergic receptors.  
This marketing authorisation application for Duloxetine Lilly has been submitted by Eli Lilly Nederland 
B.V as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended.  The  resulting  medicinal  product,  DULOXETINE  LILLY,  will  be  identical  to  CYMBALTA 
(EU/1/04/296/001-009).  
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Duloxetine Lilly medicinal product are identical to 
the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Cymbalta. The application for Duloxetine Lilly 
concerns the strength and package size identical to those approved for Cymbalta and consists of only 
Duloxetine Lilly  
EMA/753230/2014 
Page 5/13 
  
  
 
Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Cymbalta CHMP assessment 
reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. 
The approved indication is: 
“Treatment of major depressive disorder. 
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. 
Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. 
Duloxetine Lilly is indicated in adults”. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Duloxetine  Lilly  is  submitted  under  an  informed  consent  application,  article  10(c)  of  directive 
2001/83/EC,  only  module  1  is  provided  and  module  3  of  the  duplicate  dossier  cross-refers  to  the 
up-to-date module 3 of the original dossier (Cymbalta), which have been assessed and approved, 
including  all  post-marketing  procedures.  The  declaration  submitted  by  the  Applicant  states  that 
Duloxetine  Lilly  possesses  the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in  terms  of  active 
substances and same pharmaceutical form as Cymbalta. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Reference is made to the non-clinical information included in the Cymbalta EPAR (EMA/H/C/000572), 
which is acceptable since this is a marketing authorisation application by informed consent.  
The development programme of duloxetine was long, with initial toxicology studies being conducted 
in  early  1980s.  The  toxicology  and  toxicokinetic  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  Good 
Laboratory Practise (GLP) regulations except for the oldest studies, since the first directive concerning 
the  application  of  the  Good  Laboratory  Practices  (GLPs)  in  non-clinical  studies  carried  out  with 
chemical and pharmaceutical products dates 1987 (87/18/EEC). Studies previously conducted were 
carried out following Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) standards. No new non-clinical studies have been 
submitted. 
The ERA provided for this application consists of an adequate justification for the absence of specific 
study data.  
A  full  environmental  risk  assessment  conforming  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  2006)  has  been 
previously submitted to the EMA to support a Type II variation extending the indication of Cymbalta 
to include generalized anxiety disorder (EMEA/H/C/572/27) and a Type II Variation to include the use 
of  Cymbalta  to  prevent  recurrence  of  major  depressive  episodes  (EMEA/H/C/572/36).  The  data 
showed that duloxetine would not persist or accumulate in aqueous, sediment or soil compartments. 
Additionally, the predicted environmental concentrations of duloxetine were lower than the predicted 
no-effect concentrations calculated from ecotoxicity data with sentinel species. The conclusions in the 
environmental risk assessments state that human excretion of duloxetine and its metabolites is not 
expected to result in any significant environmental risk.  
The current dossier does not propose any new indications, increased doses or an expanded indicated 
population to that already authorized for Cymbalta. Additionally, the resulting medicinal product is not 
intended  to  be  marketed  in  any  European  countries  for  which  Cymbalta  is  not  already  marketed. 
Therefore, approval of this dossier is not expected to result in a significant increase in the extent of 
use of duloxetine. Therefore, the CHMP was of the view that it should not result in an increase of risk 
to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal.

The nonclinical documentation is acceptable. No further nonclinical data are required.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Cymbalta application, the clinical data in support 
of the Duloxetine Lilly application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Cymbalta dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
So no additional clinical data have been submitted and reference has been made to Module 5 data for 
Cymbalta.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Summary of the Pharmacovigilance System 
The  applicant  has  provided  the  Summary  of  the  Pharmacovigilance  System,  version  4.0  (PSMF 
reference MFL6).  
The MAH was requested to update the Summary of the PSMF including the version date. A version 6 
of the summary of the PSMF was provided with the signatures dated. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant 
fulfilled the legislative requirements. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11.2 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update.  
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP during the procedure as requested by the 
rapporteur, and they submitted a new version (11.2) with the track changes highlighted from the 
version that was being evaluated (11.1). This version, was considered acceptable by the PRAC  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 11.2 with the following content:

2.7.  Product information 
The MAH was requested to align the PI of Duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules 
with those of Cymbalta 30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules.  
The MAH submitted a new version of the product information that included the changes made in the 
recently approved text for Cymbalta from procedure EMEA/H/C/000572/WS0490/0061.The CHMP 
agreed with this revised PI. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
There are no changes to the text with respect to Cymbalta except for the invented name. The results 
of user testing of the Cymbalta patient leaflet were last submitted to the EMA in December 2008 as 
part of variation EMEA/H/C/572/37. Since the proposed Package Leaflet for the current application is 
essentially identical to the Package Leaflet of Cymbalta, no further testing is warranted. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Since this application has been submitted by Eli Lilly Nederland B.V as an informed consent application 
to  Cymbalta  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Duloxetine  Lilly  30  mg  and  60  mg  Gastro-resistant 
capsules was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for 
the following indication: 
“Treatment of major depressive disorder. 
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. 
Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. 
Duloxetine Lilly is indicated in adults”.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Duloxetine Lilly in the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic 
peripheral neuropathic pain, generalised anxiety disorder is favourable and therefore recommends 
the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

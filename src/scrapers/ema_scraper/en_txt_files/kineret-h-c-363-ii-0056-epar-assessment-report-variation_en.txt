2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) are both rare 
systemic disorders. The two groups of patients are typically treated by paediatricians (SJIA) and by adult 
rheumatologists (AOSD) separately as if they are two separate diagnostic entities. Their pathogenesis is 
still not completely understood, but is believed to be of auto-inflammatory nature. Laboratory and clinical 
observations suggest an inappropriate activation of the innate immune system, with hypersecretion of the 
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 in both SJIA and AOSD. Traditionally, similar treatments have 
been used. 
If symptoms appear during the late teens it appears arbitrary whether a diagnosis of SJIA or AOSD is 
being used. 
The pathogenesis of Still’s disease, including all ages of onset, is still not completely understood, but 
laboratory and clinical observations indicate an inappropriate activation of the innate immune system, 
with hypersecretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6, as an important mechanism of the 
disease. The activation of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 in 
disease pathogenesis has led to new targeted therapies for improved disease control. The IL-1 inhibitor 
anakinra is one such targeted treatment. 
Paediatricians describing the molecular mechanisms and cytokines in SJIA, propose that IL-1 promotes 
inflammation in an antigen-independent manner through activation of endothelium, leukocytes, and 
tissue lineages. IL-1 also modulates antigen-driven T cell immunity by activating T cells, inhibiting the 
efficacy of regulatory T cells, and promoting Th17 differentiation. New-onset SJIA, characterized by 
excess IL-1 production, could thereby give rise to an autoimmune T cell-driven arthritis. Based on this 
biphasic model, effective blockade of IL-1 (or IL-6) in the early disease process could forestall the 
development of T cell autoimmunity and alter the long-term course of the disease.  
Figure 1 – The biphasic model of SJIA 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 8/83 
 
  
  
 
Regardless of age at onset the disease course in Still’s disease is often progressive and followed by 
chronic morbidity. The prognosis in both paediatric and adult patients is poor in 50 % of the patients with 
severe joint destruction 10 years after disease onset. Despite a variety of treatments some children have 
a refractory course with significant morbidity and the disease often extends into adulthood. Among SJIA 
patients treated into adulthood, joint replacement had been required in up to 75 %. 
A vast body of evidence points to the pivotal role of IL-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of both SJIA and 
AOSD, and blockade of the IL-1 or IL-6 have emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in patients of 
all ages. The long-acting IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab is approved for Still’s disease and the long-acting 
IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is approved for treatment of SJIA (Kotter et al. 2007, Raffeiner et al. 2011, 
Hoshino et al. 1998, Jamilloux et al. 2015). 
Anakinra is a recombinant Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that blocks the biological activity of 
cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1RI (Interleukin-1 
receptor, type I), thereby controlling active inflammation. 
Kineret is currently approved for treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cryopyrin-associated periodic 
syndromes (CAPS) in the European Union (EU). 
Anakinra is in this variation proposed to be indicated for the treatment of active Still’s disease, including 
SJIA and Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD).  
Although not approved for the treatment of SJIA and AOSD, there are a number of publications and 
registers supporting the use of anakinra in these conditions. Anakinra is also included in treatment 
recommendations issued by Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) (DeWitt et al. 
2012, Kimura et al. 2014) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (Ringold et al. 2013). The 
short half-life of anakinra makes it well suited for treatment of Still's disease if withdrawal of treatment is, 
of some reason, needed. Since treatment of the early phase of the disease is typically based on high dose 
glucocorticoids, early IL-1 inhibitor treatment offers a potential for rapid tapering of glucocorticoids to 
avoid steroid dependency and the associated risks of osteoporosis, hypertension, growth disturbances 
and diabetes. Some of these are of particular relevance in children (Kim et al. 2012). The long half-life IL-
1β inhibitor canakinumab (half-life of 26 days) is approved for treatment of Still´s disease, including SJIA 
and AOSD. However, there is a reluctance to introduce the treatment early during the disease course 
because of the prolonged time required to modify exposure to the drug (half-life 26 days). It is important 
to quickly be able to terminate IL-1 inhibition therapy should untoward effects or other clinical reasons for 
discontinuation occur. Anakinra that inhibits both IL-1β and IL-1α and has a short half-life (median 5.7 
hours) enables flexible dosing and minimizes unnecessary immunosuppression and duration of potential 
treatment-related AEs. 
In the current ACR guideline for the treatment of SJIA (2013 update of the 2011 ACR guidelines) (Ringold 
et al. 2013), anakinra is recommended for use in SJIA patients with active systemic features and varying 
degrees of synovitis as an initial therapeutic option for patients with an overall physicians assessment 
score (‘MD global’) of ≥5 irrespective of the number of active joints or an ‘MD global’<5 and >0 active 
joints. In these patients anakinra was also recommended for patients with continued disease activity after 
treatment with glucocorticoid monotherapy or NSAID monotherapy (Figure 2).

Figure 2 – ACR treatment pathways for patients with active systemic features and varying degrees of 
synovitis  
The proposed new indication was for the treatment of active Still’s disease, including Systemic Juvenile 
Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD). 
The approved indication is: 
Kineret is indicated in adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body 
weight of 10 kg or above for the treatment of Still’s disease, including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic 
Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), with active systemic features of moderate to high 
disease activity, or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. 
Kineret can be given as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

The recommended starting dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/ day by subcutaneous 
injection. Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a starting dose of 1-2 
mg/kg/day.  
The evidence to support the benefit of anakinra in Still’s disease is mainly based on bibliographical data 
from real-world clinical studies. The assessment of known and potential risks of anakinra treatment in 
Still’s disease are also based on bibliographical data, but mostly on data from the use of anakinra in 
company-sponsored clinical studies in multiple indications, and the company post-marketing safety 
database, including Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) from patients treated for Still’s disease as well 
as other indications. 
A PIP was requested by PDCO in connection with the line-extension application for Kineret in Cryopyrin-
associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). The PIP, including a waiver granted for children from birth to less 
than 1 year of age, was approved on March 28, 2012 (P/0066/2012). On December 12, 2014, a 
compliance check showed that the PIP was fulfilled (EMA/PDCO Compliance Report 12/12/2014). 
The PIP (EMEA-001212-PIP01/11) included the following clinical measures related to Systemic Juvenile 
Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA): 
•  A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAH-sponsored study to evaluate 
the safety, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of anakinra in polyarticular course of Juvenile 
Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), including a subpopulation of SJIA patients (study 990758). 
•  A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored 
study to evaluate safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with SJIA (Quartier et al. 2011). 
•  A meta-analysis of available published data on efficacy and safety of anakinra in patients with 
SJIA (Meta-analysis SJIA). 
No Scientific Advice was requested. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This submission proposes an extension of the indication for Kineret (anakinra) to include also the 
treatment of active Still’s disease, including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset 
Still’s Disease (AOSD). The principal biological action of anakinra is to antagonize the effects of 
interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokines, which is utilized to mitigate the symptoms of IL-1 driven diseases. No 
additional non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies relating to the proposed indication have been performed. 
A number of non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been published in the literature and included in 
the original MAA. In essence, the non-clinical pharmacodynamics studies show that anakinra efficiently 
inhibits the action of the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β. These cytokines are critical mediators of inflammation 
and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis, cryopyrinopathies and other IL-1 driven diseases, e.g. SJIA, 
AOSD, and CAPS. 
To support the clinical development program of anakinra an extensive number of safety pharmacology 
and toxicology studies (all included in the original submission) were conducted covering general toxicity, 
reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity (tumour stimulation) and antigenicity/immunotoxicity. 
All studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
The current submission consists of a new non-clinical safety study in juvenile animals. A developmental 
toxicity study in juvenile rats (GLP compliant) has been conducted aimed to specifically investigate 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018

memory and learning function in juvenile rats. A series of safety pharmacology studies (all included in 
original submission) were conducted in an additional number of species: mice, rats, dogs, and ex vivo 
guinea pig ileum. No anakinra related effects were seen in tests of central/autonomic, analgesic activity, 
cardiovascular, digestive, or renal functions. 
The general toxicity studies were conducted in rats and non-human primates in which anakinra were 
administered via the subcutaneous (s.c.) and the intravenous (i.v.) routes. Dosing was commonly 
performed more frequently in the non-clinical studies than in man to ensure sufficient exposure in 
animals. Plasma exposure measurements were performed including immunogenicity analysis for the 
detection of anti-anakinra antibodies. In the chronic study in the rat, doses at up to 200 mg/kg/day were 
administered s.c. twice daily for 6 months.  
In the reproductive and embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies, the rat and the rabbit were 
selected as the test species.  
No regular carcinogenicity studies were performed. Long-term carcinogenicity studies were not regarded 
as relevant when considering the proteinaceous nature of anakinra. According to the ICH S6 guideline 
standard carcinogenicity studies are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
There are no concerns about a carcinogenic potential inherent to anakinra based on the pharmacological 
mode of action and observed minimal effects on the host cell resistance studies and slight enhancement 
of natural killer (NK) cell activity. Thus, no further studies were considered to be needed. A full set of in 
vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests were conducted. 
Since anakinra is an immunomodulator (antagonizing IL-1 signalling), several studies have investigated 
potential adverse effects on the immune system, including effects on host resistance, abscess resolution, 
and overall immune competence (all included in original submission). 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No new studies were submitted. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new studies were submitted. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Juvenile toxicity 
Anakinra was administered to three groups of 20 male and 20 female Sprague Dawley rat pups, each 
received anakinra twice daily from PND 7 until at least PND 44 (where Day 0 was the day of birth) by 
subcutaneous (SC) injections of 2 mL/kg. The daily doses of anakinra were 20, 60 and 200 mg/kg. 
Control animals received the vehicle (10 mM citrate buffer, 140 mM sodium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA and 
0.1% polysorbate 80, pH 6.5). 
The following parameters and end points were evaluated in all animals: clinical signs, body weights, 
multiple Y water maze test (function of learning), and gross necropsy. An additional 5 male and 5 female 
animals were allocated to separate satellite groups in the control group and the 200 mg/kg/day group. In 
addition to the end points above, these animals were also subjected to sampling and analysis of serum 
and CFS for the presence of anakinra along with the weighing and collection of the brain and liver. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 12/83 
 
  
  
The serum levels of anakinra showed that all high dose animals treated at 200 mg/kg/day were exposed 
to anakinra and there was low variability between animals. The anakinra levels in the high dose animals 
treated at 200 mg/kg/day ranged between 15 and 33 μg/mL with a mean of 22 μg/mL 2 hours post-
dosing. The anakinra levels in CSF from high dose animals ranged between 0.13 and 0.22 μg/mL with a 
mean of 0.18 μg/mL. There was no anakinra detected in the serum or CSF samples of Control animals. 
The anakinra levels in CSF were ca 1% of the serum levels and there was low variability between 
animals. 
Signs of reaction to treatment with anakinra were confined to an increase in the incidence of animals with 
red staining of the muzzle and a wet muzzle at 60 and 200 mg/kg/day when compared with the controls. 
There was no effect of dose administration on body weight gains. 
In all anakinra dosed groups, the performance in the Y-maze learning test was similar across all groups 
both during the treatment period and in the recovery period.  
The liver and brain absolute weights and weights relative to body weight in animals dosed at 200 
mg/kg/day were comparable to the controls. The liver/brain weight ratios in animals dosed at 200 
mg/kg/day were also comparable to the controls.  
In conclusion, administration of anakinra by twice daily subcutaneous injection to Sprague Dawley rats 
from Day 7 postpartum to at least Day 44 postpartum was well tolerated in rats at levels of up to 200 
mg/kg/day. Administration at 200 mg/kg/day in males and 60 or 200 mg/kg/day in females was 
associated with an increase in non-adverse clinical observations (fur staining and wet fur) which were 
found to recover after the cessation of dosing. The anakinra-treated animals did not show any signs of 
adverse effects on the hippocampus-dependent memory and learning function test when compared with 
vehicle treated control animals either on last week of dosing or after a one month recovery period. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The drug substance anakinra is a recombinant protein (Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) produced in E. 
coli bacteria containing an expression plasmid in which a synthetic gene coding for human IL-1Ra has 
been inserted. 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA 2006), proteins are exempted from environmental risk assessment because they are unlikely to 
result in significant risk to the environment. The product does not contain any other components that 
would require an environmental risk assessment under the European Medicines Agency guidelines. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The performed juvenile study did not show any concerns regarding learning and memory as tested in the 
study performed (Y-maze learning test). No adverse effects, except wet and red stained fur on the 
muzzle, were observed at doses of 60 and 200 mg/kg/day. Therefore, it is concluded that anakinra is well 
tolerated at doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day (100 times the human dose) in rats treated form PND 7 to at 
least 44 and that anakinra does not have any detrimental effect on learning and memory (in rats) at 
doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day.  
The SmPC has been updated to include the information from the juvenile study. 
The MAH has provided a justification for not performing any additional ERA studies, due to the active 
substance being a protein. This is considered acceptable by CHMP.

2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The extension application is approvable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The benefit of anakinra in Still’s disease is mainly based on bibliographical data from real-world clinical 
studies. The assessment of known and potential risks of anakinra treatment in Still’s disease are also 
based on bibliographical data, but mostly on data from the use of anakinra in company-sponsored clinical 
studies in multiple indications, and the company post-marketing safety database, including ICSRs from 
patients treated for Still’s disease as well as other indications. 
Kineret is indicated in adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body 
weight of 10 kg or above for the treatment of Still’s disease, including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic 
Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), with active systemic features of moderate to high 
disease activity, or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. 
Kineret can be given as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
The recommended starting dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/ day by subcutaneous 
injection. Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a starting dose of 1-2 
mg/kg/day.  
No Scientific Advice was requested. 
A PIP was requested by PDCO in connection with the line-extension application for Kineret in CAPS. The 
PIP, including a waiver granted for children from birth to less than 1 year of age, was approved on March 
28, 2012 (P/0066/2012). On December 12, 2014, a compliance check showed that the PIP was fulfilled 
(EMA/PDCO Compliance Report 12/12/2014). 
The PIP (EMEA-001212-PIP01/11) included the following clinical measures related to SJIA: 
•  A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAH-sponsored study to evaluate 
the safety, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of anakinra in polyarticular course JIA, 
including a subpopulation of SJIA patients (study 990758). 
•  A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator sponsored 
study to evaluate safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with SJIA (Quartier et al. 2011). 
•  A meta-analysis of available published data on efficacy and safety of anakinra in patients with 
SJIA (Meta-analysis SJIA). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In addition to the studies in the approved PIP for SJIA and the PIP-requested meta-analysis, the 
submission is based on published SJIA studies identified in a literature search. 
In order to identify all published studies with relevant information on clinical pharmacology, efficacy and 
safety, extensive literature searches were performed in collaboration with Still´s disease and 
methodology experts. The search strategy was disease and treatment specific but sufficiently broad to 
minimize the risk of missing relevant published studies. The 2 major databases MEDLINE and EMBASE 
were searched up to a cut-off of September 30, 2016.  
For the clinical pharmacology summary all published studies and case reports related to clinical 
pharmacology were reviewed. Studies and case reports including PK data and anakinra anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) data, and studies and case reports including PD data related to the basic mechanism of action for 
anakinra in Still’s disease, were summarized and results have been compared across populations and 
studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of anakinra has been previously described, in the original MAA and line extension application, for 
anakinra including the potential for interactions with other drugs. This was based on patients with RA, 
CAPS, and JIA. The main features of these studies together with the new studies including SJIA have 
been submitted and discussed.  
The MAH-sponsored study 990758 and the study by Urien et al. 2013 (which includes the patients in 
Quartier et al. 2011) provided PK data for patients with SJIA. None of the case reports retrieved in the 
literature searches for AOSD up to September 30, 2016 presented PK data. 
Analyses of data from the clinical pharmacology studies have been performed to evaluate the PK/PD 
characteristics as well as the dosing regimen of anakinra in patients with Still’s disease.

The PK of anakinra in JIA patients (including SJIA) was based on sparse sampling from 86 paediatric 
patients in the age range of 3 to 17 years and a post-hoc analysis of the 13 SJIA PK patients was 
performed.  
Typical PK parameters of anakinra have been derived from study 03-AR-0298 (CAPS patients) following 
administration of 1.0 to 4.5 mg/kg/day s.c. At a median s.c. dose of 3.0 mg/kg once daily (N=16) and a 
median treatment time of 3.5 years, the median (range) steady-state Cmax of anakinra was 3628 ng/mL 
(655 to 8511 ng/mL) and C24h 203 ng/mL (53 to 1979 ng/mL). The median (range) half-life of anakinra 
was 5.7 hours (3.1 to 28.2 hours).

Table 3 – Demographics and dosage in studies with PK objectives 
PK data in Study 990758 
Study 990758 was a company-sponsored randomized, multicenter, blinded, placebo controlled study with 
an open-label run-in period to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of daily, single, 
subcutaneous injections of anakinra in patients with JIA or SJIA.  The patients received open-label 
treatment with daily s.c. doses of 1.0 mg/kg/day up to a maximum dose of 100 mg/day. At week 12 
responders were randomized 1:1 to daily s.c. doses of placebo or anakinra. The original report described 
the overall population. One sample was collected from each subject on screening, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 or at early termination. Data collected from all patients were pooled to be used to 
characterize a population profile. 
15 patients included in study 990758 had the diagnosis of systemic JIA. For the purpose of the 
preparation of the present variation regarding the indication in Still’s disease, post-hoc analyses on 
anakinra plasma concentrations, anakinra antibodies, and inflammatory markers were performed based 
on these patients. Eight female and seven male subjects were included.  Median age was 11, range 3 to 
17 years, median body weight 32.0 kg, range 12.4 to 71.4 kg. Out of the 15 patients, 13 had at least one 
anakinra plasma concentration measurement, but two of the 13 had for unknown reasons anakinra 
concentrations below LLOQ. The 11 patients ranged from 96 to 229 ng/ml per mg/kg and the median 
steady state dose normalized anakinra concentration over 28 weeks was 157 ng/mL per mg/kg (Table 4). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 19/83 
 
  
  
 
This is similar to that observed in the total JIA population and also comparable to RA patients, 192 ng/mL 
per mg/kg (Table 5). 
Concentrations in the overall population normalized to a fixed dose of 100 mg s.c. seemed to be inversely 
related to body weight, with higher ranges of concentrations observed for patients with the lowest body 
weights. This observation is consistent with the results of the population PK analysis in adult patients with 
RA, for which the anakinra CL/F value increased with increasing BW after s.c. administration.  
The results suggest that 1 mg/kg daily s.c. dosing of anakinra for JIA patients would provide an anakinra 
exposure comparable to that reported for RA patients.

PK data in Study by Quartier et al 2011 
In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the interleukin-1 receptor 
antagonist anakinra in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (ANAJIS trial) 24 patients 
was randomized. Efficacy was evaluated after 1 month of treatment. After Month 1 patients taking 
placebo were switched to anakinra and all received an anakira dose of 2 mg/kg/day. PK samples 
(Ctrough) were taken at Month 2 and 6 when 22 and 17 patients, respectively, remained in the study 
(Amendment 2 of the protocol). PK analyses showed a trend towards lower anakinra concentrations in 
patients with lower body weight and those who had failed to respond to anakinra after 1 month

(mean±SD trough anakinra concentration 45.5 ± 51 ng/mL, range 20–122) compared to responders 
(136.5 ± 106 ng/mL, range 20–353), but overall this difference was not statistically significant. 
PK data in Study by Urien et al 2013 
In this study Anakinra pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents with systemic-onset juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis and auto-inflammatory syndromes was investigated, including 22 patients with SJIA.  
(NB: Anakinra and CRP data from the 22 SJIA patients in Quartier et al. 2011 were included in an analysis 
describing the population PK of anakinra in Urien et al. 2013).  
The PK analysis was based on data from 87 paediatric patients (32 girls and 52 boys) with a total of 148 
anakinra concentrations. The 22 SJIA patients had a median age of 7.6 years (range 2.26 to 16.8 years) 
and a median body weight of 21 kg (range 10 to 83 kg). The remaining 65 patients had a median age of 
8 years (range 0.73 to 21 years) and a median body weight of 21 kg (range 4.3 to 60 kg). These were 
patients with various auto-inflammatory conditions treated with anakinra doses of 2 to 10 mg/kg/day. 
The population PK of anakinra was described by the following equations with body weight as the sole 
significant covariate on clearance and volume of distribution:  
Absorption rate, ka (h-1) = 0.38 
Clearance, CL/F (L/h) = 0.847 x BW0.47 
Volume of distribution, V/F (L) = 2.581 x BW0.76 
The model predicted CL/F for a 70 kg subject to be 104 mL/min. The model predicts a higher clearance 
per kg body weight in children than in adults, e.g., a CL/F of 140 mL/h/kg for a 30-kg subject, and a CL/F 
of 250 mL/h/kg for a 10-kg subject. Thus, clearance increased with dose in a non-linear manner and 
lower exposure was to be expected in younger children if given the same dose. From this relationship 
CL/F can be estimated to be 42 ml/min at 10 kg and 104 ml/min at 70 kg, which indicates that 
paediatrics need about 2-fold higher doses to achieve the same exposure as in adults. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Anakinra is a recombinant IL-1Ra that blocks the biological activity of cytokine IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by 
competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1RI, thereby controlling active inflammation. Anakinra has a 
short half-life (median 5.7 hours) compared to the approved IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab (half-life of 26 
days). This enables flexible dosing with anakinra. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
7 studies and 3 case reports including SJIA patients and 6 studies and 10 case reports including AOSD 
patients provided data on markers for PD responses. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) 
were selected for evaluation since they are acute phase reactants that are closely related to IL-1 activity, 
and thereby reflect treatment efficacy of anakinra. Since CRP and SAA were not measured in all studies, 
IL-6 was also included as a PD marker.  
In SJIA patients levels of CRP were reported to be reduced in all 7 studies and 3 case reports, and 
normalized or < 0.5 mg/dL in 3 of the studies and in all case reports. SAA was reduced in 1 study and IL-
6 in 1 study and 1 case report.

In AOSD patients levels of CRP were reported to be reduced in all 6 studies and 10 case reports, and 
normalized or < 0.5 mg/dL in 3 of the studies and in 4 of the case reports. SAA and IL-6 were not 
measured.

A summary of the influence of anakinra on the PD markers CRP, SAA, and IL-6 as presented is given in 
Table 7. A more detailed summary of findings of selected markers in some of the included studies are 
presented below. 
PD data in study 990758/990779 
Post-hoc analysis with respect to patients with SJIA and CRP as PD marker are summarized in table 8 
.The CRP levels were consistently decreased during the open-label 12 weeks of the study as well as 
during the following 16 blinded weeks. 
Table 8 – CRP (mg/mL) at baseline Day 1, during open-label phase (12 weeks) and during blinded phase 
(16 weeks) 
Gattorno et al, 2008 
The pattern of response to anti–interleukin-1 treatment distinguishes two subsets of patients with 
systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The dosage regimen was 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 100 
mg/day), which could be increased to 4 mg/kg/day. The age at treatment onset ranged between 0.9 and 
18.7 years. During the first week of treatment, 2 distinct patterns of response to anakinra in the patients 
with SJIA were seen. One group of 10 patients (patients S1–S10) showed prompt control of systemic and 
articular manifestations, with normalization of CRP levels and persistence of complete control of the 
disease after a mean follow-up of 1.36 years (range 0.3 to 2.59 years). These patients were designated 
complete responders (Figure 3, left panel). 4 months after the start of therapy, they were able to 
discontinue all medications except anakinra. A second group of 11 patients [patients S11–S20 and S22 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 24/83 
 
  
  
 
 
(incomplete responders or non-responders)] exhibited a variable response to anakinra treatment, with 
general improvement soon after the initiation of the therapy, but with a tendency toward recurrence of 
the disease manifestations and elevation acute-phase reactant levels, during follow-up, despite increases 
in the daily dosage to 3 or 4 mg/kg (Figure 3, right panel). Conversely, the systemic features in these 
patients, such as fever and rash, were generally well controlled over time, which indicates that SJIA is a 
heterogeneous condition. 
No differences were observed in baseline levels of acute phase reactants [CRP, Erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR), fibrinogen, ferritin] or haemoglobin between the 2 groups. Conversely, complete responders 
had a significantly higher number of circulating neutrophils [median 19.3 x 103/mm3 (range 6.1 to 30.9 
x 103/mm3)] compared with incomplete responders and non-responders [median 9.1 x 103/mm3 (range 
7.3 to 19.7 x 103/mm3)] (p = 0.02). No significant differences in the amounts of secreted IL-1β and IL-
18 were observed between responders and incomplete responders/non-responders. 
A significant down-modulation after 1 week of treatment was observed for IL-6 (mean ± SD serum 
concentration after treatment 79.9±66.8 pg/mL; p = 0.009). When responders and non-responders were 
analysed separately, significant decreases in the levels of IL-6 (p = 0.02) and GM-CSF (p < 0.05) were 
observed in the responder group only.

The dosage regimen was 1 to 2 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 100 mg/day. The mean (SD) age at 
treatment onset was 12.4 (5.2) years. CRP decreased and response to anakinra treatment was rapid and 
sustained in a significant proportion of SJIA patients suggesting that IL-1 is a key cytokine (Table 9). The 
authors raised the issue whether the anakinra dosage should have been increased in patients that did not 
respond.

The dosage regimen was 100 mg/day. The mean (SD) age at treatment onset was 39 (18) years. 
The efficacy of anakinra was studied versus DMARD in refractory AOSD. Anakinra induced rapid 
responses, indicated by significant improvements in physical health. CRP normalized by Week 8, with no 
difference between the groups (Figure 4).

Table 10 – Overview of studies providing anakinra ADA data 
A high proportion of SJIA patients in study 990758 developed ADA (71 % in the blinded phase) and no 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected. Also in other patient populations the frequency of NAbs was 
low (0 to 3 %).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 27/83 
 
  
  
 
Table 11 – Presence of ADAs and Nabs by visit (Study 990758, SJIA Population) 
The high incidence of ADA in SJIA patients is consistent with previous experiences in other patient 
populations. Anti-anakinra antibodies were detected at one or more time-points in 50 % to 82 % in RA 
and JIA patients. The presence or absence of anti-anakinra antibodies was reported to have either no 
effect on the safety profile or in a few cases worsening of RA.  
In patients with JIA, no correlation between antibody development and adverse events (AEs) was 
observed. In patients with CAPS (study 03-AR-0298) the development of antibodies over time and their 
potential influence on outcome measures has also been evaluated. These data may also have applicability 
for patients with Still’s disease, since both conditions are inflammatory and the treatment schedules the 
same. The proportion of patients with antibodies at least once post-baseline was 82.5 %. During the first 
36 months, the proportion of patients with antibodies (ADA+) ranged from 42.9 % (Month 1) to 78.6 % 
(Month 3). At the end of study (Month 60), 50 % of the patients were ADA+. Anakinra half-life, AUC, as 
well as peak and trough concentrations did not indicate a consistent influence of ADAs on the elimination 
of the drug.  
No consistent difference between ADA- and ADA+ patients with respect to change in the efficacy measure 
was observed throughout the study. There was no relevant difference in the overall annual rate of 
treatment-emergent AEs in ADA- and ADA+ patients. 
The sub-analysis of the 15 SJIA patients in study 990758 with respect to ADA was performed by presence 
of ADAs (immunoassay) and of NAbs (cell based assay) at the 2 visits during treatment, i.e. Week 12 
(open label phase) and Week 28 (blinded phase) (Table 11). Of the 9 patients tested for ADA at Week 12 
all but 1 were ADA-positive. 8 of these patients were also tested for NAbs and all were found to be 
negative. Of the 7 patients tested at Week 28, 5 patients (71.4 %) were found to be ADA-positive and 2 
(28.6 %) were ADA-negative. Of the 5 ADA-positive patients all were NAbs-negative. No placebo patient 
tested positive.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A PK/PD modelling of anakinra and CRP data investigated in children and adolescents treated for SJIA and 
auto-inflammatory syndromes was published by Urien et al. 2013. The data were fitted to a PK/PD model 
via a population approach using Monolix.  
The combined PK/PD model including CRP data from 22 SJIA patients predicted that an average anakinra 
steady-state exposure of at least 400 ng/mL, corresponding to an AUC0-24h,ss of 9600 ng*h/mL, is 
required to produce a decrease in CRP levels to 10 mg/L or below. This exposure is similar to that in an 
adult RA patient at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg, but lower than the median dose-normalized steady-state 
AUC0-24h,ss of anakinra in NOMID patients.  
According to the model a dosage of 2 mg/kg/day to Still’s disease patients was appropriate in the 10 to 
50 kg body weight range, but not at body weights < 10 kg, for which the effective mean dose would be 3 
mg/kg/day. A fixed dose of 100 mg/day would be effective for patients with a body weight ≥ 50 kg. 
Figure 5 – Model-predicted effect of anakinra on the C-reactive concentration-time courses assuming 0.02 
to 0.40 mg/L mean steady-state anakinra concentrations in the 2 subgroups of patients. Left, high base level 
with large CRP decrease, right, moderate base CRP with initial decrease followed by a re-increase in CRP 
concentrations. 
Dosage regimen 
A target dose for treatment of patients with Still’s disease over a body-weight range of 2 to 200 kg has 
been derived based on PK/PD modelling and doses reported in clinical studies and case reports.  
The PK modelling included in total 86 subjects with body weights ranging from 4.3 to 83 kg and an age 
range of 2.26 to 21 years. The combined PK/PD model included data from 22 SJIA patients ranging in 
body weight from 10 to 83 kg and in age from 2.26 to 16.8 years. 
CL/F was described by the relationship CL/F = 0.847 x BW0.47. This relationship shows that an mg/kg 
body-weight adjusted clearance is non-linear with a higher clearance at lower body weights. The 
simulation identified body-weight intervals that could potentially be clinically important: patients with 
body weights of 2 to 10 kg, 10 to 50 kg, and 50 to 100 kg (Figure 6). To achieve the same anakinra 
concentration across the body-weight intervals the dose levels relative to the dose given to a patient with 
a body weight of 50 kg were estimated to be 3.9 at 2 kg, 2.4 at 10 kg, 1 at 50 kg, and 0.7 at 100 kg 
according the modelling. Tentative average dose levels relative to adults of the body weight range 50 to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 29/83 
 
  
  
 
 
100 kg to achieve similar concentrations over the whole body-weight range could be approximated to 3 
(2 to 10 kg), 2 (10 to 50 kg) and 1 (50 to 100 kg). 
Dosage at body weights > 100 kg was not presented in the publication since underlying weight data did 
not cover that. If extrapolations would be allowed it can be estimated that for a body weight of 200 kg, 
clearance would be further reduced and the dose relative to the body-weight interval 100 to 200 kg would 
be about 0.6. 
Figure 6 – PK/PD modelling aiming at a similar anakinra concentration over the body weight range 2 to 
200 kg, and dosing in Still’s disease patients 
The starting dose in most clinical studies with paediatric patients with Still’s disease was 1 to 2 
mg/kg/day. These patients can be assumed to belong to either the body-weight interval 10 to 50 kg or 
50 to 100 kg (as the 22 SJIA patients in the PK/PD modelling). It is not known how the 2 mg/kg doses 
were distributed over the 2 body weight intervals. Therefore, the target dose based on the clinical studies 
is assumed to be 1 to 2 mg/kg for these paediatric patients. These clinically used dose levels are in 
agreement with the average relative dose levels predicted by Urien et al. 2013. Paediatric patients with a 
body weight below 10 kg is from the PK/PD modelling expected to require a higher dose (2.4 to 3.9 
mg/kg) to achieve similar anakinra concentrations as adults due to the non-linear clearance (Figure 31). 
All adult patients described in the studies received anakinra 100 mg/day as a starting dose, and often 
also as the maintenance dose. Since the adult patients’ doses were not body-weight adjusted, the 100 
mg dose corresponds to 2 to 1 mg/kg in the range 50 to 100 kg. The average 75 kg patient in this body-
weight class administered a 100 mg dose would thus have received 1.3 mg/kg, which is in general 
agreement with the PK/PD modelling. For patients at the lower end of this interval, i.e. a 50 kg patient, a 
100 mg dose would correspond to about 2 mg/kg which is higher than the prediction, but still well within 
the safety margin of anakinra. A 200 kg patient given a 100 mg dose would receive a dose corresponding 
to 0.5 mg/kg, which is in agreement with the PK/PD modelling (Figure 6). 
Thus, from a clinical pharmacology perspective, and taking doses used in the majority of the clinical 
studies into account, the following rationale for a dosage recommendation can be formulated. The target 
dose for treatment of patients with Still’s disease would be between 2 to 1 mg/kg to patients with body 
weights between 10 and 50 kg, between 2 and 1 mg/kg for patients between 50 and 100 kg, and 1 to 0.5 
mg/kg for patients between 100 and 200 kg. The target dose for patients with a body weight above 50 kg 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 30/83 
 
  
  
 
can be approximated to a fixed dose of 100 mg as justified by clinical efficacy, safety and clinical 
pharmacology data. The target dose for patients below a body weight of 10 kg is 3 to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Dose adjustments 
The starting dose in adults was 100 mg/day in published studies. No clinical information is available on 
the potential consequences of dose changes and no dose adjustments are therefore proposed for adult 
patients.  
Anakinra exhibits approximate dose linearity regarding Cmax and AUC. Dose adjustments in steps of up 
to 1 mg/kg to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/day have been shown to be safe and effective in paediatric 
patients with CAPS. In paediatric patients with Still’s disease dose adjustments up to a dose of 9.1 
mg/kg/day have been made to control active inflammation. In paediatric patients with Still’s disease, the 
dose has in the great majority of cases ranged from 1 to 4 mg/kg/day. The steps used in the dose 
adjustments have not been specified. Response to dose adjustments, such as clinical symptoms and 
laboratory measurements, can be readily managed due to the short half-life of anakinra. 
Dosage frequency 
Patients with Still’s disease have been treated with once daily s.c. injections of anakinra. Less frequent 
injections with maintained disease remission has been reported (3 times weekly) but only one such 
reduced dosage frequency has been identified in the literature search (Maier et al. 2008). When the 
disease is in an active phase immediate onset of effect (within hours) as well as rapid reappearance of 
symptoms within a few days at discontinuation of drug treatment has been reported. This supports the 
need for daily injections of patients with Still’s disease. 
As a consequence of the reduced clearance of anakinra in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis 
(Yang et al. 2003, study 0555), a reduced dosage frequency to every other day should be considered for 
these conditions (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, as estimated from serum creatinine levels). This 
precaution is justified by the substantial elimination of anakinra by the kidney, and that the risk of 
adverse events may be greater in patients with impaired renal function if the dosage regimen is not 
adjusted. 
Dosage recommendation 
Based on the clinical pharmacology evaluations, published studies, and considering the SJIA consensus 
treatment plan issued by CARRA (Kimura et al. 2014) together with a well characterised safety profile, 
the proposed labelling text for dosage of anakinra is:  
The recommended starting dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/day by s.c. injection. 
Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a starting dose of 1 to 2 
mg/kg/day. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of anakinra has been previously characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with JIA, CAPS 
and RA. PK data in patients with Still’s disease are limited to post analysis of 13 SJIA patients included in 
the MAH-sponsored study 990758 and 22 SJIA patients, included in the two published studies by Quartier 
and Urien.  
The analysis across populations indicates that PK exposure to anakinra is comparable and that the 
general and previous description of anakinra PK also applies to the Still’s disease population.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 31/83 
 
  
  
The dosing in the CAPS study is comparable to the dosing used in study 990758 and the proposed dose in 
Still’s disease. Anakinra is approved in children with CAPS from 8 months of age and with a body weight 
> 10 kg, and these age and weight restrictions also apply to the Still’s disease indication. 
The PK data from the Quartier study used in the PK/PD model suggest that low-weight children could 
have benefitted from a higher dose (i.e. > 2 mg/kg/day). In the proposed posology, dose escalation up to 
4 mg/kg/day is recommended in case of inadequate response.  
The starting dose in most clinical studies with paediatric patients with Still’s disease was 1 to 2 
mg/kg/day and all adult patients in the presented studies received anakinra 100 mg/day as a starting 
dose. CRP and other inflammatory markers were reduced in all studies and case reports in both SJIA and 
AOSD patients. This supports the dosage used in the studies. 
Anakinra is eliminated by glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular metabolism, and clearance 
decreases with decreasing creatinine clearance, up to 75 % decrease in clearance in subjects with ESRD. 
However, Anakinra has successfully been administrated to patients with severe renal impairment and 
ESRD, without unexpected safety findings (Yang et al. 2003). The current contraindication can therefore 
be adjusted to a warning in section 4.4 with specific dosage recommendations for patients with severe 
renal impairment or ESRD.  
Dosage in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment has been clarified, including the rational for 
dosing every other day in patients with ESRD. Simulations have shown that Anakinra trough 
concentrations will be similar in patients with ESRD dosed every second day compared to patients with 
normal renal function dose daily. Cmax and AUC will be higher, but no unexpected safety concerns have 
been identified in patients with ESRD.  
Response was often rapid and consistent with the short half-life of anakinra. A group of non/incomplete 
responders were identified in the only randomized study with AOSD patients. Response of treatment 
should be evaluated after 1 month. In case of persistent systemic manifestations dose may be adjusted in 
children or continued treatment with Kineret should be reconsidered by the treating physician. This is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber. 
Anti-anakinra antibodies were frequent in the SJIA patients in study 990758 and the open label extension 
990779. This is consistent with immunogenicity in other studied populations. No patients developed 
neutralising antibodies and no impact on PK, efficacy or safety was identified. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data of anakinra in SJIA are limited and no data are available in AOSD patients. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of anakinra in the SJIA population appears to be comparable to PK in other populations 
(RA; JIA, CAPS) and extrapolation to AOSD is considered acceptable.  
The PD data in both clinical studies and case reports all demonstrate rapid and deep response on PD 
markers of IL-1 blockade, which support the use of anakinra in Still’s disease. 
The proposed dosage is consistent with the doses used in the studies and case reports and supported by 
the PK/PD model. 
Patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD have successfully been treated with anakinra with no 
unexpected toxicity, and the current contraindication in severe renal impairment is removed and changed 
into a warning with dosage recommendations in section 4.4.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Since the introduction of anakinra in 2002 in the EU for the treatment of RA, a number of inflammatory 
disorders have been found to benefit from IL-1 inhibition. Although not approved for the treatment of 
SJIA and AOSD, published studies and registers indicate the use of anakinra for more than 10 years in 
these conditions. 
SJIA and AOSD share common clinical manifestations, and there is a growing understanding that these 
are different diagnostic names applied to one single inflammatory condition, here referred to as Still´s 
disease. However, the majority of published studies of treatment results are based on studies conducted 
by paediatric rheumatologists using the diagnostic label SJIA or by rheumatologists treating adults using 
the label AOSD. Therefore, the efficacy of anakinra for individual studies is summarized separately for 
SJIA and AOSD. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study has been conducted. 
A target dose for treatment of patients with Still’s disease over a body-weight range of 2 to 200 kg has 
been derived based on PK/PD modelling and doses reported in clinical studies and case reports (see 
pharmacology part of this assessment). 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Still’s disease with paediatric onset 
The evaluation of efficacy of anakinra in Still´s disease with paediatric onset is based on the studies 
included in the PIP:  
•  A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAH-sponsored study to evaluate 
the safety, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of anakinra in polyarticular course JIA, 
including a subpopulation of SJIA patients (study 990758). 
•  A prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored 
study to evaluate safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with SJIA (Quartier et al. 2011). 
•  A meta-analysis of available published data on efficacy and safety of anakinra in patients with 
SJIA (Meta-analysis SJIA). 
A literature search identified 2 additional published clinical studies in SJIA.  
Still’s disease with adult onset 
Evidence of efficacy in Still´s disease with adult onset have been demonstrated by a meta-analysis of 8 
published studies (Hong et al, 2014) including a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study 
(Nordstrom et al, 2012), as well as 3 additional published clinical studies in AOSD. 
Prospective randomized studies: 
Study 990758 (Ilowite et al 2009) was a prospective, multicentre study of 86 patients with JIA, of 
which 15 were diagnosed with SJIA. The study consisted of a 12-week open-label run-in phase (anakinra 
treatment 1 mg/kg/day, maximum 100 mg/day), followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled phase for 16 weeks for patients responding to anakinra treatment, and a 12-month open-label 
extension phase. Data for the 15 SJIA patients from the open-label run-in phase were evaluated in a 
meta-analysis as a PIP requirement. The design of the study is shown in Figure 7. The study was 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 33/83 
 
  
  
originally designed to assess the efficacy of anakinra in JIA patients, but insufficient enrolment led to an 
amendment of the protocol that changed the primary endpoint from efficacy to safety. 
Figure 7 – Study design (990758/990779) 
Sample Size  
Approximately 90 subjects were enrolled to evaluate the safety of anakinra in the JRA population.  
Outcomes/Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with disease flares during the 16-week 
blinded phase.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Time-to-disease flare from randomization in the 16-week blinded phase. 
Change from week 12 assessments for each of the JRA core set components at week 28.  
Safety Endpoints: Treatment emergent adverse events, Laboratory assessments, Antibody response. 
Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the SJIA population are presented in the table below:

Table 12 – Demographics and baseline characteristics (990758, SJIA PK Population)  
Outcomes and estimation 
Eleven of 15 SJIA patients (73 %) were ACRpedi 30 responders in the 12-week open-label run-in phase. 
During the 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, 2 of 9 patients randomized to anakinra had 
disease flares at Week 28 compared with 1 of 2 patients randomized to placebo.  
Post-hoc analyses showed that CRP and ESR decreased over time during the open-label run-in phase 
when all patients receive anakinra, with a median CRP level of 114.0 mg/L at Baseline versus 1.5 mg/L at 
Week 12, and a median ESR level of 45.5 mm/hour at Baseline versus 7.5 mm/hour at Week 12. The 
decreased CRP and ESR levels during anakinra treatment seen during the open-label run-in phase were 
sustained during the blinded-phase (Table 13).

Study participants 
Inclusion  criteria  were  age  ranging  from  2–20  years,  a  diagnosis  of  SJIA,  more  than  6  months’  disease 
duration, active systemic disease (disease-related fever and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) >20mg/L and/or 
first hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >20) and significant overall disease activity at day 1 (D1) 
(at  least  three  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  physician  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  20/100;  (2) 
parent/patient  assessment  of  disease  effect  on  overall  wellbeing  ≥20/100;  (3)  Childhood  Health; 
Assessment  Questionnaire  score  ≥0.375/3;  (4)  ≥2  joints  with  active  arthritis;  (5)  ≥2  joints  with  non-
irreversible  limited  range  of  motion  and  (6)  ESR  ≥30)  despite  oral  prednisone  or  prednisolone  ≥0.3 
mg/kg or 10 mg/day (whichever was lower). 
Female  subjects  entering  the  study  were  prepubescent,  sexually  inactive  or  required  to  use  effective 
contraception.  
Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with an IL-1 inhibitor or any condition contraindicating 
immunosuppressive treatment. Intravenous or intra-articular steroids, immunosuppressive drugs and 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had to be stopped at least 1 month before study onset 
or for longer periods of time depending on their half-life. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
corticosteroids had to be taken at stable dosage for 1 month before D1 and until month 1 (M1). All 
patients entering the study, and their parents for patients aged <18, gave written informed consent. 
Study design  
Part 1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. At D1, eligible patients were 
randomised to receive either anakinra or placebo (1:1) from D1 to M1. Patients were stratified by centres 
and randomisation was balanced across treatments and centres.  
Investigators, other caregivers, the patients and their parents remained blinded to the assigned 
treatment. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate a higher proportion of responders in group 1 than group 2. No 
immunosuppressive drugs or DMARDs were allowed during the trial. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
and corticosteroids had to be taken at stable dosage for 1 month before D1 and until M1. 
Part 2 was an open-label treatment period: all patients received anakinra after M1. Tapering the dose of 
corticosteroids was allowed after the M1 visit (reduction of 0.4–0.5 mg/kg monthly for daily doses of ≥1.5 
mg/kg, 0.3–0.4 mg/kg for doses between 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, 0.2–0.3 mg/kg between 0.6 and 1.0 
mg/kg, 0.1–0.2 mg/kg between 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg, ≤0.10 mg/kg for doses <0.3 mg/kg).

‡Measurement of serum antipneumococcal antibodies. D, day; M, month. 
Measurement  of  serum  amyloid  A  (SAA)  and  ferritin  levels  and  the  percentage  of  glycosylated  ferritin 
were performed at D1, M1 and M6. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were performed on blood taken at M2 
and M6. 
Concentrations of anakinra in plasma samples were determined using the antibody (Ab) ELISA. 
Patients  who  were  naive  from  anti-pneumococcal  immunisation  received  Pneumo23  immunisation  at  D1 
in order to assess at M1 and M12 the effect of anakinra treatment on anti-pneumococcal Ab response to 
five capsular polysaccharides. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  a  1-month  treatment  with  anakinra  (2  mg/kg 
subcutaneous  daily,  maximum  100  mg)  versus  placebo  between  two  groups  each  with  12  patients  with 
SJIA. Response was defined by a 30% improvement of the paediatric American College of Rheumatology 
criteria  for  JIA,  resolution  of  systemic  symptoms  and  a  decrease  of  at  least  50%  of  both  C-reactive 
protein  and  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  compared  with  baseline.  After  M1,  patients  taking  placebo 
were switched to anakinra. Tapering the dose of corticosteroids was allowed after the M1 visit (reduction 
of 0.4–0.5 mg/kg monthly for daily doses of ≥1.5 mg/kg, 0.3–0.4 mg/kg for doses between 1.0 and 1.5 
mg/kg, 0.2–0.3 mg/kg between 0.6 and 1.0 mg/kg, 0.1–0.2 mg/kg between 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg, ≤0.10 
mg/kg for doses <0.3 mg/kg). 
Secondary  objectives  included  tolerance  and  efficacy  assessment  for  12  months,  and  analyses  of 
treatment effect on blood gene expression profiling.  
Results 
Outcomes and estimation 
At  M1,  8/12  (67%)  responders  were  receiving  anakinra  and  1/12  (8%)  responder  receiving  placebo 
(p=0.003).  Ten  patients  from  the  placebo  group  switched  to  anakinra;  nine  were  responders  at  M2. 
Between M1 and M12, six patients stopped treatment owing to an adverse event (n=2), lack of efficacy 
(n=2) or a disease flare (n=2). In group 2 there were responders at M1 (p=0.003), therefore the primary 
objective of the trial was met. 
Two patients from the control group stopped treatment after 5 and 11 days, respectively, owing to pain 
from injections and were withdrawn from the trial after the M1 visit; one of them, a child who presented a 
marked disease flare at D1, was the only responder at M1 in the control group

Blood gene expression profiling at enrolment and at 6 months’ follow-up showed one set of dysregulated 
genes  that  reverted  to  normal  values  in  the  clinical  responders  and  a  different  set,  including  interferon 
(IFN)-inducible genes, that was induced by anakinra. 
The dose of corticosteroids was then either maintained stable or reduced in accordance with the protocol 
recommendations at each visit.  
Seventeen patients continued the trial until M6. Their mean daily dose of predniso(lo)ne was 0.18 mg/kg 
(median 0.1 mg/kg). 
Table 14 – Responses at month 1 
Nordstrom et al, 2012 was a 24-week multicenter, randomized, open-label study of 22 patients with 
corticosteroid-dependent refractory AOSD. This was followed by the option of a 28-week open-label 
extension if improvement did not occur within the initial 24 weeks. Patients were randomized to anakinra 
(n=12; 100 mg/day) or DMARD (n=10). The mean (SD) age of the anakinra group was 39 (18) years, 
and median (range) disease duration was 14 months (2 to 240 months). The mean (SD) age of the 
DMARD group was 39 (17) years, and median (range) disease duration was 19 months (3 to 204 
months). 
The primary endpoint was remission according to specific criteria at 8 weeks: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 38/83 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Afebrile (≤37 ºC body temperature) in the absence of NSAIDs 24 hours prior to measurement. 
•  Decrease of CRP and ferritin to reference limits and normal swollen and tender joint counts. 
HAQ, Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36, and global and disease-related assessments of health were 
also applied. 
After 4 weeks, the effect of anakinra therapy was assessed. Enhancement of DMARD dose was allowed, 
but escalation of corticosteroids implied treatment failure. Efficacy was then assessed at Weeks 8, 12 and 
24.  
Data for the 12 AOSD patients treated with anakinra were evaluated in a meta-analysis performed by 
Hong et al. 2014 (discussed below). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Randomized, open-label phase (24 weeks): More patients receiving anakinra than those on DMARD 
achieved remission. In remission at Week 4 were 6 of 12 patients versus 3 of 10 patients, and in 
remission at Week 8 were 7 of 12 patients versus 5 of 10 patients. At Week 24, 6 of 12 on anakinra were 
in remission versus 2 of 10 on DMARD. In both treatment groups, CRP had normalized by Week 8, and 
the mean corticosteroid doses had been reduced by Week 24. In addition, anakinra induced greater 
improvement in physical health as measured by Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36. 
Open-label extension phase (additional 28 weeks): During the open-label extension phase, switching or 
add-on treatment with the comparator drug was possible if improvement did not occur within 24 weeks. A 
total of 17 patients completed the open-label extension phase (Week 52), of which 7 of 14 anakinra-
treated patients, and 2 of 3 patients on DMARD, were in remission. 
The authors concluded that anakinra induced more beneficial responses than DMARD. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Study populations  
Still’s disease with paediatric onset: 245 anakinra-treated patients with Still’s disease have been included 
in the studies. The mean age ranged from 7 to 12.4 years, and the median age ranged from 6 to 8.5 
years, across studies, with an age range of 0.75 to 17 years at treatment start or disease onset. The 
mean disease duration ranged from 0.2 to 7 years, and the median disease duration ranged from 4.9 to 
29 months, across studies, with a disease duration range from 1 month to 21 years. Almost all patients 
received glucocorticoids prior to anakinra treatment. The majority of patients also received MTX or anti-
TNF therapy.  
The patients in most studies were refractory to treatment pre-anakinra therapy. In one prospective 
uncontrolled study (Vastert et al. 2014), and in 2 retrospective uncontrolled studies (Nigrovic et al. 2011, 
Marvillet et al. 2011) anakinra was given as first-line therapy. 
Still’s disease with adult onset: 197 anakinra-treated patients with Still’s disease are overall included in 
the studies. The mean age ranged from 32.8 to 42 years across studies, with an age range of 17 to 73 
years at treatment start. The mean disease duration ranged from 5.7 to 9.4 years, and the median 
disease duration ranged from 7 months to 3.5 years, across studies, with a disease duration range from 1 
month to 22 years. Almost all patients received MTX, anti-TNF or glucocorticoids prior anakinra 
treatment. 
In addition to the 245 patients with paediatric onset and the 197 patients with adult onset, a number of 
case series and case reports including an approximate number of 154 patients (age range of 5 months to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 39/83 
 
  
  
73 years) were also identified in the literature search. 
Meta-analysis in Still’s disease with paediatric onset 
As part of a PIP commitment, efficacy of anakinra in SJIA has been evaluated by Sobi in a meta-analysis 
of published studies (meta-analysis SJIA). 
The scientific databases used in the literature search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, 
SciSearch and PASCAL. In total, the search identified 493 publications where 188 were found to be 
related to anakinra treatment of SJIA. Out of these, 26 publications were identified to be potentially 
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. These 26 publications were evaluated against predefined 
selection criteria to check if they could be included in the meta-analysis.  
ACRpedi 30 was used for the meta-analysis of ACR response criteria. The study-specific response was 
defined as a complete or partial benefit of anakinra treatment, as interpreted by the authors of the study. 
This typically included assessment of disease activity (e.g. fever, rash, active joints) as well as pain 
assessed by physician and patient/parent, normalization on laboratory tests (CRP levels, ESR, WBC count, 
haemoglobin level, albumin levels, platelet count) and need for supplementary medication to maintain 
clinical remission (prednisone dose). 
Based on the selection criteria, 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis using ACRpedi 30 responder 
criteria, and 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis using study-specific response criteria. One 
additional study was included in the sensitivity analysis of ACRpedi 30. 
A summary table of the included studies is presented below:

Table 15 – Basic characteristics of included studies, patient population, and dosage (patients with Still’s 
disease with paediatric onset) 
A comparison on long-term responses was not feasible due to different treatment schemes. Most of the 
selected studies were only evaluating short-term responses. 
Meta-analysis efficacy results 
ACRpedi 30 responder criteria: In all 4 studies, the majority of patients responded to anakinra treatment 
according to ACRpedi 30. Short-term ACRpedi 30 response rates ranged from 55 % to 92 %, and the 95 
% CIs of all 4 studies were overlapping. In the meta-analysis, the estimated ACRpedi 30 response rate 
was 73 % (95 % CI: 61 % to 83 %).

Hong et al, 2014, meta-analysis in Still’s disease with adult onset 
A literature search in EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library was performed on August 15, 2014, 
where a total of 273 published studies were identified. 8 studies, comprising a total number of 134 
patients, were selected for the meta-analysis. A summary table of the included studies is presented 
below:

Meta-analysis efficacy results  
Remission rate: For the calculation of remission rate, the number of patients with complete or partial 
response at the last follow-up in the anakinra group, and the total number of patients receiving anakinra, 
was used. 
All 8 studies investigated the effect of anakinra in AOSD remission (Figure 11). The remission rate at 
latest follow-up ranged from 50 % to 100 %, with the remission rate estimated in all studies being 81.66 
% (95 % CI: 69.51 % to 89.69 %).  
Figure 11 – Remission rate (Hong et al. 2014) 
Complete remission rate: For the calculation of complete remission rate, the number of patients with 
complete response at the last follow-up in the anakinra group, and the total number of patients receiving 
anakinra, was used. The complete remission rate was estimated in 5 studies (Figure 12). The complete 
remission rate ranged from 57 % to 84 %, with the complete remission rate estimated in the 5 studies 
being 66.75 % (95 % CI: 59.94 % to 75.3 %).

Responder rate  
The effect of anakinra on responder rate in patients with Still´s disease with paediatric onset is 
summarized in Table 17. Across the other studies, the percentage of responders ranged between 55 % 
and 100 %, with a responder rate above 75 % in most studies.

The effect of anakinra on responder rate in patients with Still´s disease with adult onset is summarized in 
Table 18. Across the other studies, the percentage of responders ranged between 73 % and 100 %, with 
a responder rate above 80 % in most studies. In 2 studies where only the percentage of complete 
responders was reported, this was 83 % and 92 %.

Anakinra effect on additional measures of efficacy 
Systemic signs and symptoms of inflammation  
11 studies, comprising a total number of 230 paediatric anakinra-treated patients, reported the effect of 
anakinra on systemic signs and symptoms. In paediatric patients, there was a significant difference 
between anakinra and placebo with regards to normalization of fever and inflammatory markers after 1 
month of treatment (67 % versus 8 %, p=0.003). In adult patients, there was a numerical difference 
between anakinra and DMARDs (50 % versus 30 %) in remission rate, which implies normalization of 
systemic signs and symptoms as this was a part of the definition of remission. However, no specific 
details of systemic signs and symptoms were provided in the study.

Table 19 – Normalization of systemic signs and symptoms during treatment in patients with Still’s disease 
with paediatric onset 
Eight studies, comprising a total number of 160 adult anakinra-treated patients, reported the effect of 
anakinra on systemic signs and symptoms. Across the studies, fever, rash and inflammatory markers 
normalized in 54 % to 100 % of patients. Normalization of fever and rash was seen within days and of 
inflammatory markers within weeks of therapy. 
In 378 anakinra-treated patients in 18 uncontrolled studies, fever, rash and inflammatory markers 
normalized in 45 % to 100 % of patients. Normalization of fever and rash was seen within days and of 
inflammatory markers within weeks of therapy. 
Arthritis 
For SJIA patients, beneficial effects of anakinra on the arthritis components of the ACR score was 
specifically reported in four studies. In the MAH-sponsored study 990758 (Ilowite, 2009), the effect on 
arthritis was not specifically stated, however, 11 of 15 patients (73 %) were ACRpedi 30 responders at 
Week 12. A marked improvement was seen in tender joint count and swollen joint count in AOSD 
patients, in the three studies where this was evaluated. Some studies have suggested that non-
responders to anakinra were more likely to have persistent disease with chronic long lasting arthritis.

Glucocorticoid-sparing effect 
Seven studies with a total of 152 paediatric anakinra-treated patients, reported the use of glucocorticoids 
at anakinra start and at study end. In paediatric studies reporting discontinuation of glucocorticoids, a 
total number of 12 of 43 patients (28 %) stopped glucocorticoid treatment completely. In studies 
reporting reduction in dosage of glucocorticoids, the majority of patients had tapered their dose of 
glucocorticoids at study end. 
Table 21 – Glucocorticoid-sparing effect in patients with Still’s disease with paediatric onset 
A total of 191 adult anakinra-treated patients, reported the use of glucocorticoids at anakinra start and at 
study end. In studies reporting discontinuation of glucocorticoids, a total number of 24 of 65 patients 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 48/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
(37%) stopped glucocorticoid treatment completely. In studies reporting reduction in dosage of 
glucocorticoids, many patients had tapered their dose of glucocorticoids at study end. 
Table 22 – Glucocorticoid-sparing effect in patients with Still’s disease with adult onset 
In total, 17 studies, comprising a total number of 343 anakinra-treated patients, reported the use of 
glucocorticoids at anakinra start and at study end. 
Early treatment with anakinra 
It has been hypothesized that new-onset SJIA, characterized by excess IL-1 production, could give rise to 
an autoimmune T cell-driven arthritis. Based on the biphasic model proposed by Nigrovic 2014, effective 
blockade of IL-1 (or IL-6) in the early disease process could forestall the development of T cell 
autoimmunity and alter the long-term course of the disease. 
In most published studies, patients generally had long-standing and refractory disease and were receiving 
systemic glucocorticoids and DMARDs when treatment with anakinra was initiated. Recent studies have 
investigated the timing of therapy and used anakinra as first-line therapy and in patients with new-onset 
disease. Early treatment has only been described in paediatric patients in the prospective uncontrolled 
study by Vastert et al. 2014 and in the retrospective uncontrolled studies by Nigrovic et al. 2011, Pardeo 
et al. 2015, and Marvillet et al. 2011.  
 IL-1 inhibition with anakinra early in the disease course was associated with positive outcome and 
appears to lead to reduction of the use of glucocorticoids (and therefore of the adverse effects associated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 49/83 
 
  
  
 
with glucocorticoids), as well as affect the natural course of the disease and reducing the risk of 
developing persistent arthritis. 
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
The published studies were not specifically design to study long-term treatment, however, 8 studies 
present efficacy of anakinra over time, with follow-up periods for more than 3 months. 
Long-term efficacy of anakinra was shown in a total of 8 prospective and retrospective studies for up to 3 
years in paediatric patients, and for up to nearly 6 years in adult patients, thus supporting the conclusion 
that treatment with anakinra in patients with Still´s disease provides long-term efficacy. Long-term 
efficacy of anakinra was not confirmed during the open continuation phase over 12 months in the 
Quartier et al. 2011 study. 
There are no reports of the need to increase the dose over time due to development of tolerance. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The effect of major demographic factors, including sex or ethnicity, or other intrinsic or extrinsic factors, 
such as disease severity, prior treatment, concomitant illness or drugs, alcohol, tobacco and body weight, 
has not systematically been reported in the published studies.  
The efficacy of anakinra has been thoroughly described in this submission with regards to paediatric and 
adult patients with Still´s disease, but there are no specific studies available for the use of anakinra 
among elderly Still´s disease patients. However, elderly patients were included in the available studies. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The evidence to support an approval of anakinra for Still’s disease with paediatric onset are two 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies- one MAH-sponsored and one 
investigator-sponsored. Both were part of the approved PIP. Additionally a meta-analysis of available 
published data on efficacy and safety of anakinra in SJIA patients has been performed by the Applicant 
and a published meta-analysis including a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study (Nordstrom 
et al, 2012) in patients with adult-onset Still’s disease to evaluate the effect and safety of anakinra in 
the adult population. A literature search has identified additional published studies. Altogether, evaluation 
of efficacy is based on 442 patients with Still’s disease (245 paediatric and 197 adult) overall 
representative of the Still’s disease population. Only a small number of SJIA patients were included in the 
randomized trials. Most of the data to support efficacy is from prospective and retrospective uncontrolled 
studies in patients with Still’s disease.  
The patients enrolled in the RCTs, prospective and retrospective studies are representative of the overall 
Still’s disease population. The limited number of subjects in the randomized studies is supplemented by a 
substantial number of patients in uncontrolled studies. Though a publication bias is anticipated to some 
degree, overall the totality of patients evaluated for efficacy is notable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The meta-analysis demonstrated a short term (3 months) ACRpedi 30 response rate in the paediatric 
studies of 73 %, and in the adult studies at latest follow up a remission rate of 82 % and a complete 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 50/83 
 
  
  
remission rate of 67%. In both paediatric and adult patients, a high proportion of the patients treated 
with Kineret markedly improved and complete remission was achieved in many patients. The efficacy 
results were consistent across the studies compared.  
The proportion of non-responders was up to 45 % in one study, and treatment effect should be evaluated 
after 1 month. This is addressed in the SmPC. In case of persistent systemic manifestations dose may be 
adjusted in children or continued treatment with Kineret should be reconsidered by the treating physician. 
Effect on other measures, including systemic signs of the condition and arthritis was also positive, though 
data were limited and reported inconsistently in the published studies. A glucocorticoid sparing effect was 
demonstrated across studies, though use, discontinuation and reduction of glucocorticosteroids were 
inconsistently reported across studies. Many patients could stop glucocorticoids completely, 28% of 
paediatric patients and 37 % of adult patients where this was reported, which is clearly beneficial due to 
the well-known side-effects, especially in chronic and long-term treatment 
No patients younger than 2 years of age were included in the clinical studies. The proposed age and 
weight limit in the indication is in line with the CAPS indication, where PK, efficacy and safety data are 
available. For Still’s disease, no specific efficacy or safety data are available for children younger than 2 
years. In the literature, at least three patients younger than 2 years of age have been identified, and nine 
anakinra treated patients with Still’s disease have been identified in the post-marketing safety database. 
There is a medical need in patients younger than 2 years of age, as the incidence of Still’s disease peaks 
at the age of 2. Extrapolation of efficacy and safety of Kineret treatment in Still’s disease from older 
children to children below the age of 2 is acceptable. PK of Kineret of children >= 8 months and > 10 kg 
has been established in the CAPS indication and since dosing is comparable in the Still’ disease and CAPS 
indication alignment of the age limits of the other anakinra indications is acceptable. 
Studies in adult patients with follow-up of 6 years and studies in paediatric patients with up to 3 year 
follow-up could demonstrate maintained effect, but in one of the randomized, controlled trials with active 
comparator (Quartier), the effect weaned over time.  
Hypothetically early treatment could be advantageous, prevent development of T-cell autoimmunity and 
reduce the risk of developing chronic arthritis. Few studies have investigated the effect of anakinra in 
early treatment, and though the data are promising, they are not conclusive. Given the identified risks of 
Kineret and the undetermined effect of early treatment, Kineret is not indicated as first line treatment for 
patients with mild disease.  
As such, the Kineret first-line indication is restricted to active Still’s disease with moderate to high disease 
activity and second-line in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. 
Methotrexate was allowed in the company sponsored RCT and DMARDs were used in the clinical studies 
included to support the application. Kineret can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other 
anti-inflammatory drugs and DMARDs including methotrexate in accordance with clinical guidelines.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pathogenesis of Still’s disease including hypersecretion of IL-1 and the mechanism of action of 
anakinra with IL-1 inhibition support the use of Anakinra for the condition.  
Only three small randomized, prospective, controlled studies are available to support the efficacy of 
anakinra in Still’s disease. However, an extensive literature search has identified a substantial number of 
publications adding up to more than 400 patients with Still’s disease, which is a rare condition.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 51/83 
 
  
  
Overall, all results point in the same direction of efficacy of anakinra in both paediatric and adult patients 
with Still’s disease. During assessment it was clarified that the majority of subjects included in the studies 
where patients with active systemic features of moderate to high disease activity, or with continued 
disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. 
The indication was therefore restricted to reflect the available evidence of efficacy. Remission is achieved 
in the majority of patients and most patients seem to have an effect on the systemic signs and symptoms 
associated with the condition. Anakinra also appears to have a glucocorticoid-sparing effect. The effect on 
clinical efficacy endpoints is supported by the effect on markers of IL-1 activity, with a decrease in CRP 
and other inflammatory markers.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation of anakinra is based on exposure in patients with Still’s disease, as well as in 
patients with RA, JIA, CAPS, and other indications where anakinra have been used for many years. 
Although anakinra has not been approved for treatment of SJIA, usage of anakinra is widely documented 
in the literature. The safety during this real-world usage is captured in the literature search performed for 
this application. 
Safety information about anakinra treatment in Still’s disease with paediatric and adult onset comes from 
the following sources: 
• 
The MAH-sponsored study 990758 with open label extension (990779) in 86 JIA patients, 
including a subgroup of 15 SJIA patients 
•  504 patients with Still's disease with paediatric onset (289 patients) and with adult onset (215 
patients) presented in publications identified in a literature search performed September 30, 
2016. Studies presenting safety data in patients who had received at least one dose of anakinra 
was included in the safety analysis. Patients described in the literature on an individual basis are 
handled as medically confirmed ICSR and included in the Sobi post-marketing safety database. 
The safety information of these patients are part of the post-marketing evaluation. 
• 
The Sobi post-marketing safety database including more than 566 medically confirmed ICSRs 
where the indication for anakinra treatment was Still’s disease in adult or paediatric patients 
(data lock point September 30, 2016). 
Additional safety data in patients treated for RA, CAPS, and other indications include: 
•  8518 patients with various indications since the initiation of anakinra clinical studies in May 1994. 
• 
Pooled safety data from MAH-sponsored studies in 3330 adult RA patients, whereof 2372 received 
anakinra and 958 placebo. More than 140 patients were treated with anakinra doses of ≥150 
mg/day. 
•  Data from a prospective open-label study of anakinra in 43 patients with NOMID, whereof 36 
were younger than 18 years of age. 
•  Approximately 2300 medically confirmed ICSRs from the Sobi post-marketing safety database 
where the indication for anakinra treatment was other than Still’s disease. 
Investigation of the safety of anakinra in the paediatric population is supported by the safety evaluation 
in study 03-AR-0298 in patients with severe CAPS. The safety in the adult population is supported with 
the substantial safety information collected in MAH-sponsored studies in RA, as well as during post-
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 52/83 
 
  
  
marketing use since the approval 2001. 
Publications describing individual patients have been excluded since the safety information in these 
patients are included in the Sobi post-marketing safety database as medically confirmed Individual Case 
Safety Reports (ICSR). However, there may still be a risk for overlap i.e. some AEs may be reported 
twice. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure in Still’s disease 
Safety data have been obtained from a total of 504 patients with Still´s disease (289 paediatric and 215 
adult patients), exposed to anakinra in the studies identified for this application (table 23 and 24). The 
ages span from 0.75 to 17 years in the paediatric patients, and the majority of patients with adult onset 
were between 30 and 40 years of age, ranging up to 73 years of age. The mean disease duration varies 
greatly across the studies, from 0.06 to 24.1 years. 
Table 23 – SJIA reports/publications including safety data 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 53/83 
 
  
  
 
Table 24 – AOSD publications including safety data 
Exposure to anakinra in the Still's disease population in MAH-sponsored studies is limited to one study 
(990758/990779/Ilowite et al, 2009) with 15 paediatric patients where a daily anakinra dose of 1 mg/kg 
(maximum 100 mg) was used. No dose adjustments were allowed. The exposure was 15.6 patient-years 
in the 15 SJIA patients. In the total safety population of 86 patients, the exposure was 62.8 patient-
years.  
The doses in the majority of published studies of paediatric patients were 1 to 2 mg/kg/day s.c. 
(maximum 100 mg/day). Dose escalations up to 11 mg/kg/day without reported safety problems have 
been described (Nigrovic et al. 2011). There is insufficient detail of treatment durations in some studies 
with only median values or ranges being reported. 
The dose in all published studies of patients with adult onset was 100 mg/day. 
Exposure in other indications 
Anakinra has been approved in EU since 2002 for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of RA in 
combination with methotrexate, in adults with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. Up to the 
data lock point for collection of safety data (September 30, 2016), the estimated exposure to anakinra in 
MAH-sponsored clinical studies is 6404 patient-years, which was generated in 8518 subjects. The 
majority of study subjects were patients with RA. The post-marketing exposure across all indications has 
been estimated to be 87,969 patients-years. 
In study 03-AR-0298 in patients with severe CAPS, the treatment duration was up to 5 years in 43 
patients, corresponding to 159.8 patient-years of anakinra exposure. Most patients (60.5 %) were 
exposed >4 years, and 91 % of the patients were exposed >1 year. 
Adverse events 
Analyses of the most common AEs can only be performed for study 990758/990779.  
Adverse events in study 990758/990779 
AE information was obtained when the patients came for scheduled visits. The information was coded in 
World Health Organization Adverse Reactions Terminology (WHO-ART).

Page 54/83 
 
  
  
 
Table 25 – Overview of adverse events study 990758/990779 (SJIA safety population) 
Yearly AE reporting rates in the SJIA population decreased over time. Most treatment-emergent AEs were 
reported during the open-label phase of study 990758 (66 AEs in 14 patients), giving an AE reporting 
rate of 21.3 events/patient year.  
AE reporting rates were higher for placebo than for anakinra treated SJIA patients during the blinded 
phase; 23.7 vs. 15.9, respectively. However, as there were only 3 patients exposed to placebo no 
conclusions can be drawn. The reporting rate decreased to 7.1 events/patient year (69 AEs in 9 patients) 
in patients continuing in the open-label phase of study 990779.  
There were 2 SAEs in one patient during the 990779 open-label phase. 
One patient discontinued study drug permanently on Day 1 of the 990758 open-label phase due to an AE 
(ISR). There were no discontinuations due to AEs in patients treated with placebo. 
In the total study population of both SJIA and JIA patients, AE reporting rates were similar for anakinra 
and placebo during the blinded phase, 12.7 and 15.1 events/patient-year, respectively, and decreased to 
5.7 (204 AEs in 30 patients) in the patients continuing in the open-label phase in study 990779. 
In total there were 7 SAEs, all on anakinra: 3 events in 3 patients during the open-label 990758 phase, 1 
event during the blinded phase, and 3 events in 2 patients during the open-label 990779 phase (Table 
26).

Adverse events in published studies in Still’s disease 
The most common AEs reported in Still’s disease with paediatric onset were ISR. The incidence of ISRs 
appears to decrease as therapy continues. Only in a minority of ISRs caused the patients to stop anakinra 
treatment Infections were also a commonly reported AE, both bacterial and viral. These were generally 
not serious. No injection site infections were reported. Table 27 14 summarizes AEs reported in the 
published studies.

Few AEs were reported in the studies in Still’s disease with adult onset. The majority of reports including 
ISRs were non-serious and did not lead to discontinuation of anakinra. Infections were also reported, and 
as with the ISRs the majority of patients reporting infections did not permanently stop anakinra 
treatment. 
Table 28 summarizes AEs reported from 12 AOSD patients in a randomized open-label study and from 
164 patients in other published studies identified for this submission.

Table 28 – Summary of AEs in published studies in Still’s disease with adult onset  
Common adverse events in study 990758/990779 
The most common AEs in SJIA patients during the open-label phase in study 990758 were various types 
of ISRs, followed by rash and headache, both with an AE reporting rate of 1.3 events/year. Most AEs 
were of mild or moderate severity. There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to headache.  
The yearly AE reporting rates in the open-label 990779 phase were generally lower than in other study 
phases. The most common AE was fever, 9 episodes occurred in 7 patients (rate 0.9 events/year), 
followed by arthralgia and abdominal pain, both with a yearly reporting rate of 0.6. All 3 types of events 
were reported only as being of mild or moderate severity. 
The most common AEs in the total JIA population during the open-label phase in study 990758 were 
various types of ISRs, upper respiratory infections) and headache, all with an AE reporting rate of 1.9 
events/patient/year. Other common AEs were fever and arthralgia, both with an AE reporting rate of 1.1. 
Most AEs were of mild or moderate severity.

No patient died during study 990758/990779. 
In the total Sobi safety data base, 28 patients treated with anakinra for Still's disease suffered a fatal 
SAE. In the majority of reports there are multiple confounding factors, and no clear causal relationship 
between anakinra and the events can be established. 
Serious adverse event 
SAEs in Still´s disease with paediatric onset 
SAEs reported in study 990758/990779 and in the published studies are summarized in Table 29 and 
Table 30, respectively. The most common SAEs were infections and, in published studies, MAS.

There were 6 patients with JIA that experienced 7 SAEs during study 990758/990779, whereof 1 patient 
with SJIA experienced 2 of the SAEs. Various serious infections constituted the most common type of 
SAEs, 4 out of 7 (Table 29). There are no indications of a different SAE risk or profile in SJIA patients 
compared to the total safety population of the study. 
SAEs were reported for 33 out of 273 (12 %) patients in the published studies (Table 30). MAS is 
identified here as an SAE but has a known association with SJIA (Sawhney et al. 2001). There were 14 
reports of MAS in 13 patients. The majority continued or re-started anakinra without recurrence of MAS. 
There were no reports of MAS in the 2 randomized trials.  
The study by Canna et al. 2009 specifically investigated SJIA patients with hepatitis who were taking IL-1 
RA and hence the 100 % result for the proportion of patients with this event. One of the Canna et al. 
2009 patients was also reported by Nigrovic et al. 2011. 2 patients restarted anakinra without further 
liver events.  
The SAE profile in study 990758/990779 is similar to that seen in published articles included in this 
application and in studies of adult RA patients. With the exception of MAS, the types of SAEs seen in 
anakinra treated SJIA patients concur with the known safety profile of anakinra. 
SAEs in Still´s disease with adult onset 
The most commonly described events leading to anakinra discontinuation are various types of skin 
reactions. 
Infections, bacterial and viral, are described both as SAEs, severe AEs and as cause for temporary or 
permanent withdrawal of anakinra treatment. Only 2 events of MAS are described, possibly indicating a 
lower frequency of MAS in adult Still's patients compared to paediatric.

Table 31 – Summary of SAEs in published studies in Still’s disease with adult onset 
Significant adverse events 
Infections 
In the total study population described in study 990758/990779, serious infections were uncommon and 
there were no indications of an increasing frequency of infectious episodes over time, rather the 
frequency tended to be lower during the latter part of the study. Younger patients and females seemed to 
be more affected by infectious episodes, however, the reason for this is not clear. 
Upper respiratory tract infections were the most commonly reported infectious events. 
There are no indications that the sub-group of SJIA patients has a different safety profile with regard to 
infectious episodes compared to the full population in study 990758/990779. Infections were reported in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 62/83 
 
  
  
 
 
most published studies, both in paediatric and adult patients with Still's disease. Most were non-serious, 
but a small number were serious and required temporary or permanent withdrawal of anakinra 
treatment. 
An increased risk for serious infections has been associated with anakinra and the current data support 
that this is true also for patients with Still's disease. Infections are well recognized triggers for MAS in 
patients with Still’s disease. This should be taken into account when deciding on discontinuing anakinra 
treatment during a severe infection. 
In conclusion, there are no indications of relevant differences in the frequency of non-serious and serious 
infections between Still’s patients and other populations treated with anakinra. In addition to routine 
post-marketing safety surveillance reports, all serious infections are systematically reviewed by Sobi at 
the individual case level. 
Injections site reactions  
Different types of ISRs are generally the most commonly reported AEs in the studies included in this 
submission. In post-marketing safety surveillance reports, ISRs are also the most frequently reported 
events. In general, ISRs are most frequent in the paediatric population and least frequent in elderly. The 
vast majority of reported ISRs, both in clinical studies and in reports from post-marketing use, are non-
serious and of mild to moderate intensity. ISRs typically appear within 2 weeks of therapy and disappear 
within 4 to 6 weeks, as reported in RA studies. The early appearance and subsequent disappearance 
applies also to Still’s patients. It is notable that only few patients were described to have discontinued 
treatment due to ISRs.  
It is known that cooling of the injection site, warming the injection liquid, use of cold packs (before and 
after the injection), and use of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines after the injection can alleviate 
the signs and symptoms of ISRs. No measures used to alleviate ISRs are described either in published 
studies or in study 990758/990779, possibly because the effects of such measures were unknown at the 
time when several of the studies were performed. 
MAS (macrophage activation syndrome)  
MAS is identified as an SAE although it has a known association with Still’s disease, especially SJIA 
(Ravelli et al. 2015). In the total Still’s disease population included in the literature search, consisting of 
505 patients, there are 15 reports of MAS in 14 patients treated with anakinra. 13 of the patients with 
MAS episodes were paediatrics.  
Details are provided in Table 32. In the 3 randomized trials there are no reports of MAS either in patients 
treated with anakinra or control drug.

Table 32 – Reports of MAS in studies in Still’s disease with paediatric onset 
As described in several publications, infections are well recognized triggers for MAS in Still’s disease 
patients. This should be taken into account when deciding on discontinuing anakinra treatment during a 
severe infection. The majority of Still’s patients with MAS episodes described in the literature continued or 
re-started anakinra treatment without recurrence of MAS. 
Anakinra, with or without additional immunosuppressive therapy, has been used for successful treatment 
of MAS (Minoia et al. 2014, Miettunen et al. 2011) Also in patients already treated with anakinra when 
developing MAS, an increase of the anakinra dose can help alleviating the MAS, as described by e.g. 
Nigrovic et al. 2011. 
A causal relationship between anakinra and MAS has not been established. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis were systematically reported for JIA and SJIA patients in 
study 990758/990779. A total of 4 SJIA patients experienced laboratory toxicities of grade 3 during 
anakinra treatment.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 64/83 
 
  
  
 
Open-label phase Study 990758 and the blinded phase: One SJIA patient experienced a haemoglobin 
toxicity grade 3 on study Day 1, haemoglobin was 73 g/L. The patient discontinued the study on the 
same day due to an AE of injection site pain. One SJIA patient experienced a calcium toxicity grade 3 on 
study Day 200, with calcium of 1.6 mmol/L. The patient continued anakinra treatment and completed the 
whole study. Another SJIA patient experienced an albumin toxicity grade 3 while receiving anakinra; 
albumin was 20 g/L. This patient discontinued the study 2 weeks later due to a disease flare. Both 
patients received anakinra when the toxicities occurred. 
Another SJIA patient experienced 2 haemoglobin toxicities grade 3 while on placebo.  
One JIA patient experienced transient neutropenia (neutrophils < 1.0 x 109/L) on Day 141 (blinded 
phase) with a count of 0.79 x 109/L while on anakinra; the count recovered to 1.0 x 109/L by the next 
study visit. The neutropenia was not associated with an SAE or infection. 
Another JIA patient experienced a grade 4 increase in calcium during the open label phase. The subject 
had been taking a calcium supplement prior to the increase. 
A third JIA patient experienced an ALT toxicity grade of 3 while on anakinra. This was reported as a non-
serious unrelated AE. In addition this patient had another non-serious adverse event of PT “Hepatic 
function abnormal” one month later. Both events resolved and were considered mild and not related to 
anakinra treatment by the investigator. During the blinded phase, while on anakinra, the same patient 
experienced another ALT toxicity grade of 4 and a concomitant AST toxicity grade of 3. In none of the 3 
cases was there a concomitant increase of bilirubin above the upper reference limit. The patient 
continued anakinra treatment and completed the study after a total of 442 days. 
Open-label Study 990779: No clinically relevant trends were observed in laboratory parameters during 
the open-label study 990779. 
Transient neutropenia occurred in one SJIA patient on Day 176 with a count of 0.91 x 109/L; the count 
recovered to above 1.0 x 109/L by the next study visit and was not associated with any clinical sequelae. 
The patient completed the whole study. 
Another SJIA patient experienced an AST toxicity grade 3 on Day 183 with concomitant increases in ALT, 
ALP and bilirubin. The increases in liver tests coincided with the patient’s SAE of hepatitis which was 
considered by the investigator to be due to a CMV infection. The patient completed the whole study. 
No patient experienced any associated clinical sequelae with the grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities. 
Laboratory findings are very rarely reported in published studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors have not explicitly been studied for Still’s disease. 
Elderly patients, mainly patients with RA, who have been exposed to anakinra, have shown a safety 
profile that is comparable to that in other adults. 
Safety in elderly patients has previously been evaluated, mainly in RA patients. A total of 752 patients ≥ 
65 years of age, including 163 subjects ≥ 75 years of age, have been studied in earlier, company 
sponsored clinical trials. No differences in the safety profile were observed between elderly and younger 
subjects, except for ISRs that were less frequent among elderly patients. 
Studies in patients with hepatic and renal impairment have shown that anakinra mainly is excreted 
through the kidneys and that mean plasma clearance of anakinra after s.c. administration in subjects with 
severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and end stage renal disease was reduced 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 65/83 
 
  
  
by 70 % and 75 %, respectively (study 20000268). Anakinra is not eliminated by dialysis, removal of 
anakinra via HD and CAPD is minimal (< 2.5 % of total clearance). 
For patients with hepatic insufficiency, no dosage adjustment is warranted. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between anakinra and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal studies. 
In clinical trials, no interactions between anakinra and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
corticosteroids, and DMARDs have been observed. 
Patients treated with anakinra and etanercept were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections 
(7 %) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept alone in study 20000223 and its extension 
20010190 in patients with RA receiving background treatment with methotrexate. The rates of serious 
infections and neutropenia in patients treated with the combination of anakinra and etanercept are also 
higher than what has been observed in previous trials where anakinra was used alone. 
Use of anakinra in combination with TNF blocking agents is therefore not recommended. 
The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1). In 
conditions with increased IL-1 levels it may be expected that for an IL-1 receptor antagonist, such as 
anakinra, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized during treatment. This would be 
clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin). Upon start or 
end of anakinra treatment in patients on these types of medicinal products, it may be relevant to consider 
therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration of these products and the individual dose of the 
medicinal product may need to be adjusted. 
This potential interaction is valid for patients with Still’s disease, as well as for CAPS and RA,  and is 
reflected in Section 4.5, Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction, in the 
SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No SAE caused a patient to discontinue the study 990758/990779. However, 1 out of 15 SJIA patients 
was permanently withdrawn due to an AE during the initial open label phase in study 990758. The patient 
discontinued on Day 1 of the open-label phase due to ISRs. 
Post marketing experience 
The AEs associated with anakinra use in adults are well documented since its approval for treatment of 
RA in 2001. By September 30, 2016, there were 2885 case reports with 5932 medically confirmed post-
marketing AEs in the Sobi Safety Database. 
Figure 13 provides an overview of the number of AEs by SOC in all indications combined from the Sobi 
Safety Database. “General disorders and administration site conditions” is the SOC with most reported 
AEs. This SOC contains AEs indicating various types of injection site reactions, the most common 
anakinra adverse drug reaction. The distribution of AEs in the Sobi Safety Database corresponds to the 
known safety profile of anakinra. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 66/83 
 
  
  
Figure 13 – Number of AEs by SOC, all indications 
Adverse events in paediatric and adult patients with Still's disease 
There are 566 medically confirmed post-marketing reports with 1346 AEs in the Safety Database 
concerning patients where the indication for anakinra treatment is reported to be Still's disease in either 
paediatric or adult patients. Out of these, 237 reports (42 %) with 570 AEs concern paediatric patients. 
There are 102 case reports with a total of 193 AEs, whereof 54 serious, where the age or age group is 
unknown. These reports have been included in the adult population.  
There are only minor differences in the distribution of SAEs over MedDRA SOCs in paediatric and adult 
patients with Still´s disease. 
It is notable that events of MAS constitute 74 % of all SAEs seen in paediatric patients with Still's disease 
but only 38 % in adults. The reason for this difference in frequency is not clear. The frequency of fully 
developed MAS in SJIA and AOSD is similar, 10 to 15 %. However, the true frequency of MAS in SJIA 
may be higher since subclinical and mild MAS occurs in another 30 to 40 % of patients with SJIA 
(Gerfaud-Valentin et al. 2014a,Ravelli et al. 2015). 
As when comparing all AEs there are some differences in the distribution of SAEs across indications. The 
major difference is the higher relative frequency of MAS and hepatobiliary events in patients with Still's 
disease. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 67/83 
 
  
  
 
 
Figure 14 – Distribution of SAEs by SOC, patients with Still’s disease and other indications  
MAS is a known serious complication to Still's disease. The frequency of fully developed MAS in Still's 
disease is 10 to 15 % (Gerfaud-Valentin et al. 2014a,Ravelli et al. 2015). Anakinra has not been 
associated with MAS and it should be noted that there are multiple reports describing anakinra as a 
successful treatment for MAS. 
Anakinra has been associated with signs of liver injury, including non-infectious hepatitis. However, 
various signs of hepatocellular injury are also common manifestations of Still's disease, both in paediatric 
and adult patients, and are also common in patients that develop MAS, including subclinical MAS.    
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The presented data in paediatric and adult patients with Still’s disease together with substantial safety 
data from post-marketing in both Still’s disease and other indications are overall adequate to evaluate 
short term safety of anakinra in the proposed indication.  
No new adverse events have been identified. The most common adverse events were ISRs, and most 
were mild and did not necessarily lead to treatment discontinuation. Fever, rash and headache are also 
common adverse events. The rate of AEs seems to be declining over time. Overall, around 12 % of 
patients discontinued treatment, mainly due to injection site reactions or infections. The reporting rate for 
ISRs was slightly higher in females than in males. However, there were no major differences between the 
AE profiles in male vs. female patients. The infections rate is higher in children of younger age, but this is 
not considered related to Kineret treatment. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 68/83 
 
  
  
 
 
12 % of the paediatric patients in the published studies experienced a SAE compared to 0.4 % in the 
adult population. Underreporting is expected in the published studies in the adult population. The most 
commonly reported SAEs were infections and MAS. Infection is a well-known risk of anakinra. A trend for 
increased rate of infections in children of younger age is reported in Still´s disease patients and CAPS 
patients. The most commonly reported infectious episodes were upper respiratory tract infections. There 
were no discontinuations due to infectious events. In CAPS patients an increased rate of infection is 
documented in patients <2 years (3.4) and 2 to 11 years (2.2), compared with the older age groups. 
MAS is more frequent in children, and is probably more related to the underlying condition than to 
anakinra treatment. No causal relationship between MAS and anakinra has been established. Infections 
may trigger MAS, Anakinra may alleviate symptoms of MAS and cessation of anakinra treatment may 
worsen MAS. Recommendations have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to guide prescribers in 
case of infections and/or MAS.  
To guide the prescriber it has been stated in the SmPC that “Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a 
known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with Still’s disease. If MAS occurs, or is 
suspected, evaluation and treatment should be started as early as possible. Physicians should be 
attentive to symptoms of infection or worsening of Still’s disease, as these are known triggers for MAS. 
Available data are limited regarding whether Kineret can be continued during serious 
infections in patients with Still’s disease. If Kineret treatment is continued during serious 
infections to reduce the risk for a disease flare, careful monitoring is required.” 
Discontinuation of anakinra treatment in case of infections in Mb Still patients could increase the risk of 
disease flare, with possible increased risk of MAS. Available data are limited regarding whether Kineret 
can be continued, but Kineret has been safely administered also during serious infections. 
MAS is an important potential risk of Kineret and intensified post marketing safety surveillance is planned. 
A specific questionnaire will be sent out if a case report describing MAS in a patient with Kineret is 
received. A post marketing prospective observational study in the Eurofever registry via the associated 
Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) network is ongoing (see Risk 
Management Plan section). A final report after one year from the start of the study will be provided. The 
proposed methodology is considered adequate. 
The overall safety data in other indications are substantial, and the safety information from patients with 
Still’s disease is sufficient for assessment of short term safety. A non-interventional PASS is planned to 
collect long-term safety data from existing registries. 
Overall, the safety profile of anakinra in Still’s disease was comparable to the safety in other conditions 
besides an increased risk of MAS and hepatobiliary disorders. Data in the submitted studies and post-
marketing reports all indicated an increased risk of hepatobiliary disorders in patients with Still’s disease. 
Also, additional case reports of anakinra related liver toxicity has raised concerns. Though the condition 
Still’s disease itself carries a risk of increase in liver values the risk of anakinra induced liver toxicity, 
especially in patients with Still’s disease is still a concern and precautions addressed in the SmPC, 
especially how to monitor hepatic function and early signs of liver toxicity has been included.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, anakinra used in patients with Still’s disease seems to be well tolerated with an acceptable and 
well-known safety profile. Mild and manageable ISRs are the most common adverse events.  
Patients with Still’s disease have an increased risk of infections and infections are also a risk of anakinra. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 69/83 
 
  
  
The results of the studies and post-marketing reports suggest a risk of liver toxicity with anakinra, 
especially in patients with Still’s disease. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. Furthermore, safety 
data are still lacking for long-term use in Still’s disease, but appropriate investigation of long-term safety 
using registries with data of > 1000 SJIA patients and data going back to 2011 will be conducted.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The package leaflet included in this submission is identical to the previously readability tested package 
leaflet for Kineret (indicated for RA and CAPS) with the only difference between the two leaflets being the 
new indication. 
As this information is the only differing aspect between the PILs, the result of the Readability Test for the 
Kineret (indicated for RA and CAPS) also applies to Kineret (indicated for RA, CAPS and Still’s disease). 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Study 2: Open-label study to evaluate safety and clinical response in 
patients with neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease, and Study 5: A multicentre randomised 
double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with systemic-
onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (ANAJIS trial) contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan 
P/0066/2012, are completed, and have been completed after 26 January 2007, are considered as 
significant. 
In accordance with the criteria foreseen in the ‘EC Guideline on the format and content of applications for 
agreement or modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and 
concerning the operation of the compliance check and on the criteria for assessing significant studies’ 
(2014/C 338/01), Study 5 is considered significant in line with criteria a) being randomised placebo 
controlled comparative efficacy studies, whilst Study 2 is a prospective clinical study, the results of which 
contribute to further characterisation of the safety profile of the medicinal product in the paediatric 
population.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SJIA and AOSD are terms that identify pathological conditions, characterized by similar laboratory and 
clinical features, gene expression profiles, pathogenic mechanisms and treatment approaches, indicating 
that they are reflections of the same disease, Still´s disease, with the differentiating factor being the age 
at onset (with an arbitrarily age cut-off).  
Still´s disease is a debilitating and difficult-to-treat disorder with few approved treatment options. In 
children it is the most severe form of arthritis. The onset of Still’s disease is characterized by prominent 
systemic features with arthritis ensuing slowly during the first weeks or months of disease. Systemic 
features tend to subside or become less prominent with persisting arthritis in over half of the patients. 
The disease course is often progressive and followed by chronic morbidity, regardless of age at onset. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
To date NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, TNFα antagonists and IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors are used in the 
treatment of Still’s disease, but are often only partially effective. The most commonly used treatment has 
been glucocorticoids which are effective in controlling systemic symptoms, as well as arthritis. However, 
this is achieved at high doses (often at doses markedly higher than 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent) 
which are associated, in the long term, with a wide range of adverse events, including osteoporosis, 
pathological fractures (e.g. vertebral compression), cataracts, growth retardation, diabetes, and 
susceptibility to infection. 
The IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab is approved for treatment of Still’s disease, and the IL-6 inhibitor 
tocilizumab is approved for treatment of SJIA. However, these treatments are to be used in second-line 
after inadequate response to NSAIDs and systemic corticoids. Both can be given as monotherapy or in 
combination with methotrexate.  Kineret was applied for a first-line indication, but during assessment this 
was restricted to first-line in patients with moderate to severe disease activity or in patients with 
continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or 
glucocorticoids to reflect as this was the main patient population in the clinical studies submitted to 
support the application. 
When a diagnosis of AOSD or SJIA is suspected, it might be appropriate to use a short-acting IL-1 
inhibitor such as anakinra to investigate whether the disease process is actually responding to IL-1 
blockade. 
Anakinra is today being used off-label for treatment of Still’s disease. The recommendations issued by the 
CARRA (DeWitt et al. 2012,Kimura et al. 2014) and the ACR (Ringold et al. 2013) to use anakinra in the 
treatment of SJIA underpins the importance of a short-acting IL-1 inhibitor for the treatment of the 
disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence to support the benefit of anakinra in Still’s disease is mainly based on bibliographical data 
from real-world clinical studies. The paediatric investigational plan included a prospective, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAH-sponsored study to evaluate the safety, clinical response, and

pharmacokinetics of anakinra in JIA, including a subpopulation of SJIA patients (study 990758), a 
prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored study to 
evaluate safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with SJIA (Quartier et al. 2011) and a meta-analysis 
of available published data on efficacy and safety of anakinra in patients with SJIA (Meta-analysis SJIA). 
The assessment of known and potential risks of anakinra treatment in Still’s disease are also based on 
bibliographical data, but mostly on data from the use of anakinra in company-sponsored clinical studies in 
multiple indications, and the company post-marketing safety database, including Individual case safety 
reports (ICSRs) from patients treated for Still’s disease as well as other indications. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a published randomized controlled study in 24 SJIA 
patients treated with Kineret for up to 1 year. After a 1-month blinded phase, 8 of 12 patients in the 
Kineret treated group were identified as modified ACRpedi30 responders compared to 1 of 12 in the 
placebo group. At the same time point, 7 of 12 in the Kineret treated group were classified as ACRpedi50 
and 5 of 12 as ACRpedi70 responders compared to none in the placebo group. 16 patients completed the 
subsequent open label phase and among 7 responders at month 12, 6 had stopped glucocorticoid 
treatment and 5 of them had inactive disease. 
In a published prospective, uncontrolled, observational cohort study of 20 patients with new-onset SJIA 
Kineret was used as initial therapy after failure to respond to NSAIDs, but before the use of DMARDs, 
systemic glucocorticoids, or other biologic agents. Treatment with Kineret resulted in normalization of 
body temperature in 18 of 20 patients. At 1 year follow-up, 18 of 20 patients showed at least an adapted 
ACRpedi 70 response, and 17 of 20 patients reached an adapted ACRpedi 90 response as well as inactive 
disease. 
The safety and efficacy of Kineret versus DMARD have been reported in a published 24-week multicentre, 
randomized, open-label study of 22 patients with glucocorticoid-dependent refractory AOSD. At Week 24, 
6 of 12 patients on anakinra were in remission versus 2 of 10 patients on DMARDs. During an open-label 
extension phase, switching or add-on treatment with the comparator drug was possible if improvement 
did not occur within 24 weeks. 17 patients completed the open-label extension phase (Week 52), of 
which 7 of 14 Kineret-treated patients, and 2 of 3 patients on DMARDs, were in remission at that time 
point. 
Additional published data in Still’s disease indicate that Kineret induces a rapid resolution of systemic 
features such as fever, rash, and elevation of acute phase reactants. Glucocorticoid doses can in many 
cases be reduced after initiation of Kineret therapy. 
Furthermore the beneficial effect of anakinra in Still’s disease in both paediatric and adult patients has 
been shown in two meta-analyses of published data on efficacy and safety in patients with SJIA which 
demonstrated a high response rate, irrespectively of response criteria, in clinically relevant outcomes.  
In summary a high rate of normalization of systemic signs of inflammation such as fever, rash and 
increased CRP has also been demonstrated across studies. Rash and fever disappeared after few days of 
anakinra treatment, and inflammatory markers in all studies, including CRP and ESR, was normalized 
within weeks.  
Most studies reported use of glucocorticoids and demonstrated that anakinra had a substantial 
glucocorticoid-sparing effect, which is of significant clinical benefit to the patients due to the well-known 
side-effects of glucocorticoids, especially in long-term treatment.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/169769/2018 
Page 75/83 
 
  
  
The benefits of anakinra have been reported consistently across studies, regardless of study design and 
concomitant treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Some patients are identified as non-responders, up to 45 % in the submitted studies. Treatment 
response should be evaluated after 1 month. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
The evidence to support the benefit of anakinra comes mainly from uncontrolled studies. Only three small 
randomized studies are available to support the real-world evidence. Some publication bias is expected. 
Also, the publication of results, both prospectively and retrospectively collected, are likely to be from 
dedicated centres and the external validity of the results may be questionable.  
No children below the age of 2 have been included in the clinical studies; however, efficacy of Kineret in 
children below the age of 2 has been shown in few cases identified in the literature. While extrapolation of 
efficacy and safety to children below the age of 2 is acceptable, no PK data in children below 8 months 
are available to support dosing. The indication is therefore limited to children > 8 months of age and > 10 
kg in line with the other Kineret indications. 
A potential disadvantage of anakinra is the short half-life (4-6 h). This could imply that in some patients 
more than one injection is needed per 24 hours though this was only very rarely effectuated in the clinical 
studies. Especially in children with a much higher clearance of anakinra a considerable volume has then 
to be injected. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data for > 400 patients with Still’s disease are available. Supporting safety data from other 
indications include more than 6000 patient-years of anakinra treatment in the MAH-sponsored clinical 
studies and more than 80,000 patient years of anakinra treatment as post-marketing experience.  
The most common adverse events following anakinra treatment is ISRs, mostly mild to moderate that 
only rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Other common adverse events are fever, rash and 
headache. Infections are a serious well-known risk of anakinra treatment. The rate of SAEs was generally 
low, with a higher incidence in the paediatric studies (12 %) and probably underreporting in the adult 
studies (0.4 %).  
Higher incidences of MAS and liver related adverse events were seen in the patients with Still’s disease 
compared to incidences in other indications. A causal relationship between MAS and anakinra has not 
been established.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Recently several case report of anakinra related liver toxicity in Still’s disease has been published.  A 
causal relationship has not been established but cannot be ruled out either. Long term safety data in 
Still’s disease are limited but will be evaluated in a PASS study using registry data from > 1000 SJIA 
patients.  
No children below the age of 2 have been included in the clinical studies, but limited evidence from the 
literature and the few cases from the post-marketing safety database indicate similar safety in children 
younger than 2 years compared to older children and adults. As mentioned above, while extrapolation of 
efficacy and safety to children below the age of 2 is acceptable, no PK data in children below 8 months

are available to support dosing. The indication is therefore limited to children > 8 months of age and > 10 
kg in line with the other Kineret indications.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefits of anakinra in Still’s disease has been demonstrated in one MAH-sponsored randomized 
clinical trials, two published randomized controlled trials and otherwise in published uncontrolled 
prospective and retrospective studies. Anakinra has been used off-label for more than ten years for the 
treatment of Still’s disease. Still’s disease is a rare condition, and each individual published study is too 
small to show significant effect of anakinra in clinically relevant endpoints. As such, the efficacy of 
anakinra has been investigated in two meta-analyses, one in paediatric patients and one in adult patients 
with Still’s disease, and both meta-analysis show a high response rate of anakinra. Additional clinically 
relevant endpoints, e.g. glucocorticoid sparing effect and effect on systemic signs and symptoms all point

in the same direction and support the use of anakinra in Still’s disease. The safety of anakinra in Still’s 
disease is well-described in the published studies together with the post-marketing experience also from 
other indications. An increased incidence of MAS is likely related to the underlying condition and anakinra 
may actually alleviate MAS and not cause MAS. However, data are limited regarding administration of 
Kineret during a serious infection in patients with Still’s disease. Available data is limited regarding 
whether Kineret can be continued during serious infections. If Kineret treatment is continued during 
infections, careful monitoring is required. Besides an increase in liver enzymes and a potential increased 
risk of anakinra-related liver toxicity in Still’s disease, the overall safety profile is comparable across 
indications. The reporting rate of serious adverse events is low, especially in adults, and the most 
common AEs are mild to moderate ISSR.  
However, data for early treatment are yet limited and restricted to uncontrolled studies. Clinical 
guidelines recommend treatment of sJIA with anakinra as monotherapy only in patients with higher 
severity or in patients with continued disease activity after treatment with glucocorticoid monotherapy or 
NSAID monotherapy. Patients included in the clinical controlled studies had also in general moderate to 
severe disease activity. It should also be noted that canakinumab (Ilaris) has a second line indication in 
Still’s disease, and tocilizumab (RoActemra) a second-line indication in SJIA. Taking into account the 
known risk of infections with anakinra, and the uncertainties regarding liver toxicity, anakinra as first-line 
treatment is restricted to patients with moderate to severe active systemic disease or second line in 
patients with continued disease activity after treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The high response rates of anakinra across studies and response criteria for patients with Still’s disease 
are of significant clinical value and clear benefit to the patients. The demonstrated glucocorticoid-sparing 
effect is considerable. Avoidance or limitation of the well—known side effects of long-term glucocorticoid 
treatment is important. The identified potential higher incidence of anakinra related liver toxicity events in 
patients with Still’s disease is easily outweighed by the beneficial effects shown in the controlled and 
uncontrolled studies. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kineret is positive.

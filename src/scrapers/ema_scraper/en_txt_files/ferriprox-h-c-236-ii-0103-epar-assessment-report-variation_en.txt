2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
b-Thalassemia  major  (b-TM)  is  a  heritable  blood  disorder  where  the  inability  to  form  functional 
hemoglobin  (Hb)  results  in  life-threatening  anemia,  requiring  life-long  transfusions  to  maintain  life. 
Iron  overload  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  morbidity  in  patients  with  thalassemia  major.  Chronic 
transfusions invariably lead to rapid accumulation of iron since the human body has no natural ability 
to  actively  excrete  iron1.  The  excess  iron  is  mainly  stored  in  the  liver  (70.0  to  90.0%),  but  will  also 
redistribute to the heart and endocrine tissues 2,3. Main causes of mortality are due to sudden cardiac 
death, arrhythmia, and heart failure from cardiac iron overload. The majority of morbidity stems from 
liver cirrhosis from hepatic iron overload and endocrine dysfunction. The goal of iron chelation therapy 
is  to  reduce iron  overload  in  the  susceptible  organs  and  to  prevent  end-organ  damage  (heart  failure, 
liver cirrhosis, endocrinopathies), morbidities known to reduce survival in this population. 
Three  iron  chelators  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU.  Deferoxamine  (DFO,  Desferal®)  is  a 
parenterally-administered iron chelator that has been shown to reduce mortality and LIC compared to 
placebo4. Two oral products deferiprone (DFP, Ferriprox®) and deferasirox (DFX, Exjade®) were then 
approved  for  iron  overload  treatment  in  patients  with  thalassaemia  major.  Oral  chelators,  DFP  and 
DFX, are conventionally used as monotherapy5. 
Efficacy  of  iron  chelators  combination  is  the  subject  of  many  research.  However,  based  on  the 
indications  of  DFX  and  DFP,  their  combination  with  other  iron  chelator  therapies  is  considered  as  an 
off-label use. 
Deferiprone  (DFP)  is  an  oral  iron  chelator  that  has  demonstrated  efficacy  similar  to  DFO6,7.  However, 
its  side  effects  (neutropenia,  agranulocytosis,  elevation  in  hepatic  enzymes,  and  arthralgia)  have 
precluded its widespread6,7. 
In response to the PRAC recommendation, the MAH conducted a review of data in the clinical database 
and  of  the  published  literature  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  combination  of  Ferriprox  with  other 
chelators which was presented in the last type II variation (EMEA/H/C/236/II/89G). Efficacy and safety 
data on the use of combination therapy are finally presented in this extension of indication to include a 
new indication for Ferriprox in combination with another chelator.

2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  provided  a  clinical  overview  with  published  literature  data  on  the  combination  therapy  of 
deferiprone with deferoxamine and deferiprone with deferasirox. This variation application provides an 
assessment of this clinical overview in light of results of clinical trials and recent consensus statement 
from  the  American  Heart  Association.  A  tabulation  of  the  submitted  publications  is  presented  in 
Appendix A. 
2.2.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
Most of the literature on chelators combination describes deferiprone/deferoxamine association.  
A shuttling hypothesis8 whereby synergistic cellular iron mobilization requires one chelator to have the 
physicochemical  properties  to  enter  cells,  chelate  intracellular iron  and  subsequently  donate iron  to  a 
second 'sink' chelator has been proposed. 
DFO’s  metabolism  is  due  almost  entirely  to  various  enzymes  in  plasma,  thus  hepatic  metabolism  of 
oral iron chelators should not be affected. Specific substrate specificities between deferasirox (mostly 
UGT1AUGT1A1  and  to  a  lesser  extent  UGT1A3)  and  deferiprone  (UGT1A6)  should  not  lead  to  drug 
interaction9,10.  
The provided pharmacology studies seem sufficient. At least additive effects can be expected and even 
some synergy, while pharmacological data (PK and PD) do not theoretically prevent the combination of 
DFO with DFP. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.3.1.  Main studies 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. The MAH provided a clinical overview with 
published  literature  data  on  the  efficiency  of  deferiprone,  deferoxamine,  deferasirox  in  monotherapy 
and in combination (see Appendix A and B). 
In  these  studies,  iron  overload  was  measured  by  multiple  methods  usually  used  in  clinical  practice. 
Combinations of these different techniques have been used to evaluate chelators efficiency. 
Serum ferritin level can be measured frequently via blood testing and is particularly useful to monitor 
trends in iron burden over time. Elevated liver iron concentration (LIC) has been found to be correlated 
with total body iron stores in b-TM patients11.

of iron chelating agents. J. Blood.Med. 2011:2 135-149. 
Measurement of the amount of iron eliminated in urine and feces provides an equivocal determination 
of  the  effectiveness  of  an  iron  chelator  in  removing  iron  from  the  body  (normally  urine  and  feces 
contain negligible amounts of iron (~1 mg/day)12. 
The  proportion  of  ferritin  measurements  of  >2500  mg/L  was  established  as  an  important  prognostic 
factor  on  cardiac  disease-free  survival  in  b-TM  patients  on  iron  chelation.  However,  a  ferritin  level 
below 2500 mg/L does not preclude the presence of severe cardiac iron overload13. 
Measurement  of  T2  relaxation  time  (T2*)  by  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  via  gradient 
recall echo provides a more accurate and highly reproducible assessment of cardiac iron overload14.

Table from Kwiatkowski. Management of transfusional iron overload-differential properties and efficacy 
of iron chelating agents. J. Blood.Med. 2011:2 135-149. 
A clinical trial conducted by Maggio et al.14  included 144 patients with thalassemia major. Patient were 
randomly assigned to DFP (75 mg/kg/day) (n = 71) or DFO (50 mg/kg/day) (n = 73) for 1 year. No 
difference in the reduction of serum ferritin was observed (222 ± 783 ng/ml with DFP and 232 ± 619 
ng/ml with DFO; p= 0.81). No difference in the reduction of liver and heart iron content was found by 
magnetic  resonance  between  the  two  groups.  These  results  demonstrated  no  difference  after  12 
months  of  treatment  in  serum  ferritin  levels  or  liver  and  heart  iron  content.  However,  the  assessor 
observes that the very high variances reported in both groups should prevent any conclusion on similar 
effects or even non-inferiority and this study is poorly informative. 
A  randomized  controlled  trial  was  performed  in  61  patients  previously  maintained  on  subcutaneous 
deferoxamine15. The primary end point was the change in myocardial siderosis (myocardial T2*) over 1 
year  in  patients  maintained  on  subcutaneous  deferoxamine  or  those  switched  to  oral  deferiprone 
monotherapy. The dose of deferiprone was 92 mg/kg/d and deferoxamine was 43 mg/kg for 5.7 d/wk. 
The  improvement  in  myocardial  T2(*)  was  significantly  greater  for  deferiprone  than  deferoxamine 
(27% vs 13%; P = 0.023). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LEFV) increased significantly more in the 
deferiprone-treated group (3.1% vs 0.3% absolute units; P = 0.003). The changes in liver iron level (-
0.93 mg/g dry weight vs -1.54 mg/g dry weight; P = 0.40) and serum ferritin level (-181 microg/L vs -
466  microg/L;  P  =  0.16),  respectively,  were  not  significantly  different  between  groups.  Deferiprone 
monotherapy  was  significantly  more  effective  than  deferoxamine  over  1  year  in  improving 
asymptomatic myocardial siderosis in beta-thalassemia major. 
In  this  last  study,  the  assessor  observes  that  DFP  produces  a  lager  effect  on  all  three  investigated 
parameters and the relative potency compared to DFO is roughly of a same extent. The fact that only 
LEVF  change  reached  statistical  significance  may  indicate  that  this  parameter  is  more  powerful  to 
detect  differences,  not  necessarily  that  DFP  has  a  more  pronounced  effect  specifically  on  this 
parameter. 
A  variety  of  factors  differentiate  the  currently  available  iron  chelators.  First,  the  various 
pharmacological  properties  (including  the  stoichiometry  of  iron  chelation,  mode  of  administration, 
dosing schedule, plasma half-life, and route of excretion) of the different chelators are well described 
in the literature. Second, drug efficacy is variable, particularly with regard to organ-specific (hepatic, 
cardiac) iron removal. Third, adverse-effect profiles differ among chelators.

Differential  properties  of 
the 
iron  chelators  [5]  are  summarized 
in 
the 
table  below: 
It  is  then  acknowledged  that  chelation  therapy  needs  to  be  individualized.  The  three  chelators 
available  allow  the  physicians  to  adapt  the  chelation  therapy  according  to  different  parameters 
(compliance,  efficacy,  toxicity,  …)  in  case  of  treatment  failure,  unsuitability  of  current  treatment  and 
urgent need for rapid chelation. Adaptation of the doses and switch to a different chelator remain the 
first  options.  However,  combination  therapy  may  be  proposed in  order  to  give  the  possibility  to  take 
advantage of the different pharmacological properties of the different chelators for specific cases. The 
combination therapy includes the possibility to give concomitantly or alternatively iron chelators. The 
way to manage combination therapy remains to be more precisely described (OC). 
Main studies of deferiprone and deferoxamine combination chelation therapy 
1. Efficacy on iron overload 
A randomized controlled trial16 compared combination therapy (n=32) to DFO alone (n=33) for 1 year. 
The patients were pretreated by DFO monotherapy. All patients were administered DFO 5 days a week 
at  a  dosage  of  35  mg/kg/day,  and  those  in  the  combination  treatment  group  additionally  received 
daily  Ferriprox  (75  mg/kg  per  day).  Significantly  greater  improvement  in  serum  ferritin  in  the 
combined group (-976 versus -233 µg/L; P=0.001) was observed. 
Another controlled trial 17 randomized 60 patients undergoing chelation with DFO to either remain on 
DFO monotherapy (5 to 7 days per week) or switch to an alternating regimen (5 days of deferiprone 
(75  mg/kg  per  day)  alternating  with  2  days  of  DFO.  Both  arms  resulted  in  equivalent  decreases  of 
serum  ferritin  (-248  ±  791  µg/l  for  the  alternating  therapy  group  vs  -  349  ±  573  µg/l  for  the  DFO 
group; p = 0.5802).

Alternating  therapy  has  also  been  evaluated  in  a  long-term  trial  that  included  a  5-year  follow-up  18. 
213 patients (pretreated by DFO or DFP) were randomized to DFP at 75 mg/kg, divided into three oral 
daily  doses,  for  4  d/week  and  DFO  by  subcutaneous  infusion  (8–12  h)  at  50  mg/kg  per  day  for  the 
remaining  3  d/week  (n=105)  was  compared  with  DFP  alone  at  75  mg/kg  (n=108),  administered  7 
d/week  during  a  5-year  follow-up.  The  group  receiving  alternating  therapy  showed  a  significant 
reduction in serum ferritin.   
In  conclusion,  in  the  randomized  trial  with  65  patients,  DFP-DFO  combination  administered 
concomitantly  is  associated  with  greater  efficacy  than  DFO  alone  as  regards  serum  ferritin  level  in 
patients previously treated.  
In a randomized trial with 60 patients, alternating therapy (5 days of deferiprone (75 mg/kg per day) 
alternating with 2 days of DFO) compared to DFO alone did not show greater efficacy in decrease in 
serum  ferritin  level  than  DFO  alone.  However,  a  randomized  trial  with  213  patients  showed  that 
alternating  therapy  (4  days  of  deferiprone  (75  mg/kg  per  day  alternating  with  3  days  of  DFO) 
compared to DFP alone was correlated with a greater efficacy in decrease of serum ferritin level. The 
fact  that  alternating  therapy  demonstrated  its  superiority  over  DFP  and  not  over  DFO  may  indicate 
that this solution may rather rescue inefficient DFP monotherapy. 
2. Efficacy on cardiac iron overload 
A  consensus  statement  from  the  American  Heart  Association  has  been  established  in  2013.  Use  of 
deferiprone-DFO  combination  therapy  is  recommended  in  patients  suffering  moderate  to  severe 
cardiac  iron  overload  or  when  cardiac  dysfunction  is  detected:  “The  first  principle  of  management  of 
acute  heart  failure  is  control  of  cardiac  toxicity  related  to  free  iron  by  urgent  commencement  of  a 
continuous,  uninterrupted  infusion  of  high-dose  intravenous  deferoxamine,  augmented  by  oral 
deferiprone”. 
A  randomized  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial19  compared  the  use  of  deferoxamine  alone  or  in 
combination  with  deferiprone  (75  mg/kg  per  day)  in  the  treatment  of  65  patients  with  mild  to 
moderate  cardiac  iron  loading  (cardiac  T2*  8–20  ms).  The  beneficial  effect  of  combined  therapy  on 
cardiac  iron  removal  and  improvement  in  cardiac  function  was  confirmed.  After  one  year,  those 
receiving combination therapy had significantly greater improvement in cardiac T2* (from 11.7 to 17.7 
ms  compared  with  12.4  to  15.7  ms)  and  in  LVEF  (2.6%  compared  with  0.6%)  than  those  receiving 
deferoxamine alone. 
Efficacy  of  deferoxamine  and  deferiprone  combination  was  confirmed  in  a  single  arm  trial  20  of  15 
patients  with  severe  myocardial  siderosis  (T2*  <8  ms)  and  myocardial  dysfunction.    At  baseline, 
deferoxamine  was  prescribed  at  38  +/-  10.2  mg/kg  for  5.3  days/week,  and  deferiprone  at  73.9  +/- 
4.0  mg/kg/day.  Treatment  with  deferoxamine  combined  with  deferiprone  resulted  in  significant

In  contrast  to  what  was  observed  for  alternating  therapy,  simultaneous  combination  therapy  of 
DFO/DFP may improve a marker of cardiac overload when compared to DFO, making the simultaneous 
combination superior to DFO when heart iron overload must receive control. 
3. Effect on liver iron concentration 
One  observational  study  described  a  more  rapid  decline  of  liver  iron  concentration  with  combination 
compared  to  monotherapy21.  In  a  study  of  52  patients22  who  switched  from  deferoxamine 
monotherapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy at baseline, 98% of patients had 
hepatic  iron  overload  and  64%  had  severe  hepatic  overload:  after  3  years  of  combination  therapy, 
these  proportions  declined  to  60%  and  10%,  respectively,  and  by  5  years,  none  of  the  50  patients 
remaining on the study had iron overload. 
Thus, combination therapy could be an alternative therapeutic option in case of mild or severe hepatic 
iron overload uncontrolled by iron chelator monotherapy.  
4. Effect on endocrine complications 
Regarding endocrine complications, a small study in 11 patients showed that combined therapy (DFO 
at 35–50 mg/kg, 3–4 times a week associated with DFP at 75 mg/kg, per os, daily) improved glucose 
metabolism23.  In  a  study  from  Greece,  reversal  of  endocrine  complications  with  very  intensive 
combined chelation (DFP 75-100 mg/kg/day and DFO 20-60 mg/kg/day) has been reported. Abnormal 
glucose  metabolism  was  normalized  in  11  of  39  (44%)23,  several  cases  of  hypothyroidism,  and 
hypogonadism  reversal  were  reported25.  However,  zinc  deficiency  has  also  been  implicated  in  the 
development  of  hypogonadism  and  has  been  more  commonly  associated  with  DFP  chelation  therapy 
than DFO or DFX24. DFP cannot be associated with a better decrease endocrine complication. Further 
studies are awaited. 
5. Effect on survival 
Randomized  trial  evaluating  the  survival  of  the  deferiprone-DFO  combination  treatment  were 
provided25.  The  multivariate  analysis  in  Cyprus  showed  that  combined  chelation  was  associated  with 
improved  survival.  The  proposed  explanation  by  the  authors  of  the  significant  trend  of  increasing 
between  1980  and  2000  (p<0.001)  and  a  decline  (but  not  significant)  after  2000  cardiac  deaths 
(p=0.06) was the introduction of the combination therapy. In the small long-term comparative study 
(16  patients  on  DFO  monotherapy  and  19  patients  on  deferiprone  and  DFO  combination  therapy), 
there was no increased mortality with the combination26.

A major factor affecting mortality in any disease (especially severe and life threatening) over a recent 
period of 20 years is the global improvement in healthcare systems efficiency. To take the example of 
heart failure, improved prevention/detection, availability of new drugs (beta blockers, RAS inhibitors).  
Roger V et al reported in the JAMA 2004 that “survival after heart failure diagnosis improved over time 
(5-year age-adjusted survival, 43% in 1979-1984 vs 52% in 1996-2000, P<.001). However, men and 
younger  persons  experienced  larger  survival  gains,  contrasting  with  less  or  no  improvement  for 
women and elderly persons.” 
Applied to a younger population and most often before diagnosis of heart failure in a population goes 
for very intensive follow-up, this improvement may be even larger.  
As  a  consequence,  the  demonstration  that  combination  therapy explained  mortality  improvements in 
Cyprus  is  considered  very  weak  by  the  assessor.  No  statement  related  to  this  improvement  should 
take place in the AR and in the PI. 
Main studies of deferiprone and deferasirox combination chelation therapy 
Among  the  5  publications  presented  in  the  Appendix  B:  2  of  them  were  case  studies27,28  with  one 
patient;  two  others  were  prospective,  single  center  studies  carried  by  Farmaki  et  al.29  in  15  patients 
and  Totadri  et  al.  30in  36  patients  showed  serum  ferritin  significant  decreases.  In  addition,  liver  iron 
concentration and cardiac iron load decreased in Farmaki et al. study.  
Data  from  the  randomized  prospective  study31showed  that  both  combination  regimes  DFP/DFX  and 
DFP/DFO were similarly effective in reducing liver iron concentration and serum ferritin in heavily iron 
loaded TM patients with normal cardiac function. However, this study was carried only in two centers, 
48 patients in each group. No data was provided in comparison with monotherapy. 
In conclusion, further studies were needed to complete the evaluation of the effect of this combination 
on larger number of patients and with different grades of iron overload severity. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
As  noted  by  the  MAH,  most  studies  are  observational,  only  few  are  prospective  and/or  randomized. 
The high number of publications shows the interest of combination therapy by the scientific community 
in  the  treatment  of  severe  bTM.  Comparative  studies  and  some  randomized  clinical  trials  show  that 
DFP-DFO combination is associated with relatively more rapid or pronounced serum ferritin decreases 
when compared with monotherapy. In addition, a decrease in serum ferritin could be associated with a

decrease in iron liver. However, effects on endocrine complications and survival remain unclear. Use of 
the  combination  on  moderate  and  severe  cardiac  complications  is  the  only  clear  indication.  For  the 
DFP-DFX  combination,  data  are  also too  preliminary  and  further  studies  on larger  number of  patients 
and with different grades of iron overload severity are needed.  
Randomized trial with alternating therapy (Maggio et al., 2009) or combination therapy (Gomber et al., 
2004; Aydinok et al., 2007) compared to DFP alone concluded to a greater efficacy of combination to 
decrease  serum  ferritin  level.  As  supported  by  the  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of  Transfusion 
Dependent Thalassaemia (TDT) 3rd Edition (Cappellini et al. 2014), these studies show that SF can be 
controlled with a relatively low frequency of DFO given twice a week when combined with DFP standard 
doses (75 mg/kg/day). The fact that DFO-DFP combination therapy demonstrated its superiority over 
DFP  and  not  over  DFO  (Galanello  et  al.,  2006;  Aydinok  et  al.,  2007)  may  indicate  that  this  solution 
may  rather  rescue  inefficient  DFP  monotherapy  or  provide  a  more  acceptable  option  to  patients  not 
accepting  frequent  infusions  anymore  (which  may  correspond  to  an  inefficient  monotherapy  due  to 
tolerability issues and is covered by the Rapporteurs’ indication wording).  
A similar SF decrease was observed between DFP-DFO combination compared to DFO (Aydinok et al., 
2007) but a greater efficacy of the combination was found in patients which received more days of DFO 
(5 days vs. 2 days) (Tanner et al., 2007). Tanner et al. (2007) compared the use of DFO alone or in 
combination  with  DFP  (75  mg/kg  per  day)  in  the  treatment  of  65  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
cardiac iron loading (cardiac T2* 8–20 ms). The beneficial effect of combined therapy on cardiac iron 
removal  and  improvement  in  cardiac  function  was  confirmed.  Efficacy  of  DFO-DFP  combination  was 
confirmed  in  a  single  arm  trial  of  15  patients  with  severe  myocardial  siderosis  (T2*  <8  ms)  and 
myocardial dysfunction (Tanner et al., 2008). In contrast to what was observed for alternating therapy, 
simultaneous  combination  therapy  of  DFO/DFP  may  improve  a  marker  of  cardiac  overload  when 
compared  to  DFO,  making  the  simultaneous  combination  superior  to  DFO  when  heart  iron  overload 
must receive control.  
In summary, data from the published literature on iron balance studies in patients with thalassaemia 
major show that the use of Ferriprox concurrently with deferoxamine (coadministration of both 
chelators during the same day, either simultaneously or sequentially, e.g., Ferriprox during the day 
and deferoxamine during the night), promotes greater iron excretion than either drug alone. Doses of 
Ferriprox in those studies ranged from 50 to 100 mg/kg/day and doses of deferoxamine from 40 to 60 
mg/kg/day. However, chelation therapy may not necessarily protect against iron-induced organ 
damage. 
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluated the effect of concurrent therapy with 
Ferriprox and deferoxamine in patients with thalassaemia major, who previously received the standard 
chelation monotherapy with subcutaneous deferoxamine and had mild to moderate cardiac iron loading 
(myocardial T2* from 8 to 20 ms). Following randomization, 32 patients received deferoxamine (43.4 
mg/kg/day for 5 days/week) and Ferriprox (75 mg/kg/day) and 33 patients received deferoxamine 
monotherapy (34.9 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week). After one year of study therapy, patients on 
concurrent chelation therapy had experienced a significantly greater reduction in serum ferritin (1574 
µg/l to 598 µg/l with concurrent therapy vs. 1379 µg/l to 1146 µg/l with deferoxamine monotherapy, 
p<0.001), significantly greater reduction in myocardial iron overload, as assessed by an increase in 
MRI T2* (11.7 ms to 17.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 12.4 ms to 15.7 ms with deferoxamine 
monotherapy, p=0.02) and significantly greater reduction in liver iron concentration, also assessed by 
an increase in MRI T2* (4.9 ms to 10.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 4.2 ms to 5.0 ms with 
deferoxamine monotherapy, p< 0.001). 
The above information has been included in section 5.1. of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/591403/2015 
Page 14/50 
 
  
  
The wording of the indication has been agreed as: 
Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia 
major when current chelation deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with 
thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when 
prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac 
overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction (see section 4.2). 
Dose adjustments when used with other iron chelators have been included in  the SmPC section 4.2. as 
follows:  
In patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate, Ferriprox may be used with deferoxamine at the 
standard dose (75 mg/kg/day) but should not exceed 100 mg/kg/day. 
In the case of iron-induced heart failure, Ferriprox at 75-100 mg/kg/day should be added to 
deferoxamine therapy. The product information of deferoxamine should be consulted. 
Concurrent use of iron chelators is not recommended in patients whose serum ferritin falls below 
500 µg/l due to the risk of excessive iron removal. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP acknowledge the conditions in which the combination chelation therapy is needed: a failure 
to control the iron burden at maximum dosage of current chelators and when current chelators cannot 
be adequately used, e.g. associated with dose-limiting toxicities. 
Moreover, in the absence of evidence that a particular combination is a problem, its use should not be 
restrained, and the possibility to use Ferriprox in combination should be given to the clinician based on 
its own assessment of the potential benefit for the patient. Therefore the combination of Ferriprox with 
another chelator in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is 
ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly 
cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive – is supported by the above data. 
Efficacy data of the DFP-DFX combination is very limited due to the small number of patients exposed 
and the lack of information about the safety of this combination (only 5 patients exposed in the MAH 
clinical trials). Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been differentiated in 
the  SmPC.  Additional  precautions  for  use  have  been  added  on  the  combination  of  deferiprone  and 
deferasirox as limited data are available. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
2.4.1.  Main Studies 
Safety data collected by ApoPharma during later-stage clinical trials and safety results published in the 
literature were provided in this application instead of new relevant data from dedicated trial.   
In  the  pooled  safety  database  of  all  patients  enrolled  in  ApoPharma  clinical  trials  (N=712  as  of  31 
August  2014),  115  patients  received  combination  Ferriprox-DFO  therapy,  with  a  mean  exposure  of 
slightly over 2 years.  Five other patients received combination Ferriprox-DFX therapy (not included in

the  table  below).  A  list  of  ADRs  from  Apopharma  database  that  compares  the  proportion  of  ADRs 
between  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  was  provided  in  Appendix  C.  The  total 
exposure for Ferriprox in combination with DFO is lower than for Ferriprox monotherapy (244 vs 1343 
PY  (patient-years).  The  incidence  rate  of  events  (for  100  PY)  is  higher  in  the  arm  of  Ferriprox  in 
combination  with  DFO  in  2  system  organ  class:  cardiac  disorders  (1.64  vs  0.15),  infections  (1.64  vs 
0.74),  investigations  (14.75  vs  14.60)  and  Ear  disorders  (0.82  vs  0.37).  The  main  cardiac  disorders 
reported  are  rhythm  troubles  (but  we  cannot  totally  exclude  the  fact  that  it  could  be  related  to  iron 
overload  in  heart).  The  safety  database  was  also  reviewed  for  reports  of  serious  ADRs  from  post-
marketing surveillance.  While this review did not allow for comparison of incidence, the nature of the 
reported reactions did not raise any safety concerns.  A list of post-marketing serious ADRs that were 
associated with deferiprone-DFO combination therapy is provided in Appendix D, and for deferiprone-
DFX combination therapy in Appendix E.  
A search for studies that reported safety data on combination therapies between 1998 and June 2015 
identified 57 publications that presented safety data on combination therapy:  
49 publications on deferiprone-DFO (Appendix F) and 8 publications on deferiprone-DFX (Appendix G).   
Based  on  the  indications  of  deferiprone,  the  combination  of  deferiprone  with  other  iron  chelator 
therapies  (deferoxamine  or  deferasirox)  is  considered  as  an  off-label  use.  Deferiprone-DFO 
combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in the provided studies. Thus, data 
are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were very heterogenous 
according  the  studies.  Only  dedicated  studies  could  provide  an  answer  on  the  relevance  of  this 
combination as long as on the efficacy and safety aspect. 
In  addition,  no  clear  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  association  deferiprone-  deferasirox  as  only 
isolated patients received such combination in published literature. In the SPC of Exjade, combination 
with  other  chelators  are  contra-indicated  as  the  safety  of  such  combination  were  not  clearly 
established.  Combination  with  other  iron  chelator  therapy  is  an  exclusion  criteria  in  clinical  trial 
development program of Exjade. 
Whatever the iron chelators associated, we cannot totally exclude that this potential risk remains. 
Furthermore,  in  post-marketing  setting,  in  Eudravigilance  database,  there  are  7  fatal  (3  fatal 
agranulocytosis and 4 fatal cardiac complications) 
a) one Swedish published case32 in a 10-years old patient with DBA (off-label use) : in this case, the girl 
developed agranulocytosis 9 weeks after chelation with deferiprone was initiated (45 mg/kg daily, 60% of 
recommended  dose)  in  addition  to  her  ordinary  deferoxamine  therapy.  The  blood  count  checked  weekly 
dropped  markedly  between  week  8  and  9.  She  rapidly  developed  a  septicemia.  Despite  G-CSF  and 
corticoid therapy, she remained neutropenic and died 6 weeks after admission. According to the authors, 
DBA  patients  may  be  more  prone  than  thalassemia  patients  to  developing  deferiprone  associated 
agranulocytosis as DBA patients may develop bone marrow hypoplasia. However, it should kept in mind 
that  in  this  case  the  agranulocytosis    developed  rapidly  after  addition  of  deferiprone  to  her  ordinary 
deferoxamine therapy and agranulocytosis is not predictable and as well possibly not dose dependent.  
b) One Swedish case (in Swedish in EV) was reported in a 12 years-old girl with beta-thalassemia : the 
patient  has  received  transfusions  since  early  age  and  had  a  failed  bone  marrow  transplantation.  She 
received deferiprone (1.5g) in addition of deferoxamine (unknown dose). After six months of treatment, 
during  ferriprox  dose  escalation,  neutrophils  count  drop  <0.1  G/l  and  platelets  dropped  to 70  (N  :  140-
400)  within  one  week  despite  weekly  controls.    The  day  after  the  onset  of  fever,  CRP  was  250mg/L. 
Ferriprox was stopped and treatment with G-CSF was started. The patient developed a sepsis (E coli) and 
a sore throat with streptococcus B. She experienced several cardiac arrests. An increased sensitivity due

to cardiac iron overload was also suspected and died. 
c)  One  case  from  Iran  was  reported  in  a  22  years-old  beta-thalassemic  patient.  The  patient  began 
treatment  with  deferiprone  (75mg/kg/day)  due  to iron  overload in  combination  with  deferoxamine  (3g). 
Two  months  later,  the  patient  had  neutrophils  count  decreased  and  agranulocytosis  was  diagnosed  with 
septic shock. The patient developed ARDS and died 10 days after event onset. 
And  4  fatal  cardiac  complications  (including  one  with  DFP+DFX  and  3  with  DFP+DFO),  probably  due  to 
disease progression (cardiac iron overload). 
In  addition,  23  other  life-threatening  cases  were  retrieved  with  combined  DFP+DFO  in  eudravigilance 
database  (mainly  agranulocytosis  occurring  in  young  beta-thalassemic  patients  and  occurring  most 
frequently  within  the  1st  months  of  combined  therapy.  In  most  cases,  the  patient  recovered  without 
sequelae after drug interruption). 
Recently,  a  French  serious  case  of  arthropathy/arthralgia  occurred  within  3  months  with  combination 
DFO+DFP  (doses  unknown)  in  a  6  years-old  thalassemic  patient.  Symptoms  improved  after  DFP 
discontinuation  but  remains  under  DFO  monotherapy.  This  case  (coded  as  leading  to  disability  or 
incapacity)  suggests  a  possible  addition  of  adverse  effects  of  each  iron  chelator  associated  which  is 
worrying. 
However, as concludes the COCHRANE report (2013)33 on the use of oral DFP for iron chelation in people 
with thalassaemia, a meta-analysis of a further two trials showed a significant increased risk of adverse 
events associated with combined DFP-DFO compared with DFO alone, RR 3.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 7.83) and 
there  is  no  adequately-powered,  high-quality  trials  comparing  the  overall  clinical  efficacy  and  long-term 
outcome of deferiprone with desferrioxamine, allowing to have a precise idea on how to manage in clinical 
practice the association of chelators in terms of posology and regimen to insure the safety for patients. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH provided in a first part of this procedure a review of the safety data collected by itself during 
later-stage clinical trials and in a second part safety results published in the literature. 
DFP-DFO  combination  therapy  was  not  associated  with  new  safety  concerns  in  the  provided  studies. 
Thus,  data  are  reassuring  but  should  be  taken  with  considerable  caution  as  dose  regimen  were  very 
heterogenous according the studies. Only dedicated studies could provide an answer on the relevance 
of this combination as long as on the efficacy and safety aspect. 
In  addition,  no  clear  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  association  DFP-DFX  as  only  isolated  patients 
received such combination in published literature. 
Whatever  the  iron  chelators  associated,  we  cannot  totally  exclude  that  this  potential  risk  remains.  7 
fatal  cases  caused  by  agranulocytosis  or  cardiac  complications  have  been  observed  in  Eudravigilance 
database.  Thus,  the  warning  “Fatalities  and  life-threatening  situations  (caused  by  agranulocytosis) 
have  been  reported  with  deferiprone  in  combination  with  deferoxamine”  has  been  included  in  the 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
A  list  of  ADRs  from  Apopharma  database  that  compares  the  proportion  of  ADRs  between  deferiprone 
monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  was  provided.  Data  from  pooled  safety  database  from  clinical 
trials  (244  patients-year  exposed  for  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  1343  patients-year  exposed  to 
Ferriprox  and  deferoxamine)  showed  statistically  significant  (p<0.05)  differences  in  the  incidence  of

disorders”  and  "Renal  and  urinary  disorders"  were  lower  during  combination  therapy  than 
monotherapy,  whereas  the  incidence  of  “Cardiac  disorders"  was  higher  during  combination  therapy 
than  monotherapy.  The  higher  rate  of  “Cardiac  disorders"  reported  during  combination  therapy  than 
monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who 
received combination therapy. 
In  consequence,  the  CHMP  proposes  to  modify  the  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  include 
precaution  for  use  related  to  cardiac  disorders  (see  section  2.9  of  this  procedure:  Update  of  Product 
Information). 
In  the  safety  profile  of  DFP-DFO  combination  provided  by  the  MAH,  only  18  children  have  been 
exposed to the combination. Thus, it is very difficult to draw any sound conclusion on these findings. 
However,  the  number  of  children  treated  with  the  combination  and  the  incidence  of  adverse  events 
have been documented in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Information on Combined use with other iron chelators has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC; 
The use of combination therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The response to 
therapy should be assessed periodically, and the occurrence of adverse events closely monitored. 
Fatalities and life-threatening situations (caused by agranulocytosis) have been reported with 
deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Combination therapy with deferoxamine is not 
recommended when monotherapy with either chelator is adequate or when serum ferritin falls below 
500 µg/l. Limited data are available on the combined use of Ferriprox and deferasirox, and caution 
should be applied when considering the use of such combination. 
The safety profile of combination therapy (deferiprone and deferoxamine) observed in clinical trials, 
post-marketing experience or published literature was consistent with that characterized for 
monotherapy. 
Data from the pooled safety database from clinical trials (1343 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox 
monotherapy and 244 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox and deferoxamine) showed statistically 
significant (p<0.05) differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on System Organ Class for 
“Cardiac disorders", "Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and urinary 
disorders". The incidences of “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and urinary 
disorders" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence of 
“Cardiac disorders" was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 
“Cardiac disorders" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the 
higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. 
Careful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4). 
The incidences of adverse reactions experienced by 18 children and 97 adults treated with combination 
therapy were not significantly different between the two age groups except in the incidence of 
arthropathy (11.1% in children vs. none in adults, p=0.02). Evaluation of rate of reactions per 
100 patient-years of exposure showed that only the rate of diarrhoea was significantly higher in 
children (11.05) than in adults (2.01, p=0.01). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As safety data of the combination deferiprone and deferasirox are too preliminary, this combination is 
not recommended. Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been 
differentiated in the SmPC. Additional precautions for use have been added on the combination of 
deferiprone and deferasirox as limited data are available.

Deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in the 
provided studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose 
regimen were very heterogenous according the studies.  In consequence, relevant warnings and 
precautions concerning cardiac disorders and agranulocytosis are included in the section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. All available information on the safety profile of the combination is included in section 4.8. of 
the SmPC.

No adverse events 
or toxicity were 
reported during 
combination 
treatment with an 
alternative 
schedule.  
The results of 
presented studies 
demonstrated that 
DFPDFX 
combination 
therapy was not 
associated with a 
greater incidence 
of adverse events 
or any 
unanticipated 
adverse events. In 
all reported cases 
combination 
therapy was well 
tolerated.

 Safety results are based on published data in reviewed studies and not intended to represent the actual incidence of adverse events in a target population.  
 The percentage was calculated based on a number of patients receiving combination therapy, unless the ratio was specified in the publication. **** It is unclear 
whether the same subjects participated in more than one study.

Following the review and assessment of the available data (see Clinical efficacy and Clinical Safety 
discussions above), the CHMP agrees to extend the Ferriprox indication as follows: 
Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia 
major when current chelation deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with 
thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when 
prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac 
overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction (see section 4.2). 
Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC  were also updated to reflect the relevant information. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this 
procedure to update the Product Information in compliance with the QRD template version 9.1 and 
combine the SmPC for the 500mg and 1000mg tablets. The contact details of France and Portugal 
have been updated in the PL. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Iron overload is one of the major causes of morbidity in patients with thalassemia major. Main causes 
of  mortality  are  sudden  cardiac  death,  arrhythmia,  and  heart  failure  from  cardiac  iron  overload.  The 
majority of morbidity stems from liver cirrhosis from hepatic iron overload and endocrine dysfunction. 
The goal of iron chelation therapy is to reduce iron overload in the susceptible organs and to prevent 
end-organ damage (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, endocrinopathy), morbidities known to reduce survival 
in  this  population.  Three  chelators  are  available  in  the  EU  and  their  respective  indications,  while  not 
specifying  monotherapy,  do  not  recommend  combination  use  and  do  not  describe  when  a  combined 
treatment should be used, nor the practical modalities of such treatments. Efficacy and safety data of 
combinations are not mentioned in the available information for these products. 
The  conditions  in  which  the  combination  chelation  therapy  is  needed  are  acknowledged:  a  failure  to 
control the iron burden at maximum dosage of current chelators and when current chelators cannot be 
adequately used, e.g. associated with dose-limiting toxicities.

Comparative studies and some randomized clinical trials show that DFP-DFO combination is associated 
with relatively more rapid or pronounced serum ferritin decreases when compared with monotherapy. 
In  addition,  a  decrease  in  serum  ferritin  could  be  associated  with  a  decrease  in  iron  liver.  No 
pharmacological problems prevent this use and even a theoretical synergy may suggest that DFO/DFP 
is a right choice. 
Randomized trials with alternating therapy or combination therapy compared to DFP alone concluded 
to  a  greater  efficacy  of  combination  to  decrease  serum  ferritin  level  (e.g.  Maggio  et  al.,  2009).  As 
supported  by  the  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of  Transfusion  Dependent  Thalassaemia  (TDT)  3rd 
Edition  (Cappellini  et  al.  2014),  these  studies  show  that  SF  can  be  controlled  with  a  relatively  low 
frequency of DFO given twice a week when combined with DFP standard doses (75 mg/kg/day). The 
fact that DFO-DFP combination therapy demonstrated its superiority over DFP and not over DFO may 
indicate  that  this  solution  may  rather  rescue  inefficient  DFP  monotherapy  or  provide  a  more 
acceptable option to patients not accepting frequent infusions anymore.  
Randomized trial (Tanner et al., 2007) showed greater efficacy of the combination DFP-DFO compared 
to DFO alone in patients which received 5 days of DFO. Simultaneous combination therapy of DFO/DFP 
may  improve  a  marker  of  cardiac  overload  when  compared  to  DFO,  making  the  simultaneous 
combination superior to DFO when heart iron overload must receive control.  
As  a  request  of  the  CHMP  on  the  last  round,  the  MAH  proposed  a  new  wording  with  a  starting  and  a 
limited dose of deferiprone in association with deferoxamine in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Efficacy data of the DFP-DFX combination is very limited due to the small number of patients exposed 
and the lack of information about the safety of this combination (only 5 patients exposed in the MAH 
clinical trials). Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been differentiated in 
the  SmPC.  Additional  precautions  for  use  have  been  added  on  the  combination  of  deferiprone  and 
deferasirox as limited data are available. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  expected  superior  effect  of  combination  over  mono-components  is  established  on  iron  overload 
markers  only,  but  not  on  hard  clinical  endpoints  such  as  frequency/severity  of  complications  or 
prolonged survival.  One report based on a 20-year survey in Cyprus concludes that the introduction 
of  the  combination  resulted  in  an  improvement  of  survival  in  patients  with  beta-thalassemia  major, 
was discussed.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Deferiprone-DFO  combination  therapy  was  not  associated  with  new  safety  concerns  in  the  provided 
studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were 
very heterogeneous according the studies.  
In  Eudravigilance  database,  7  fatal  cases  have  been  observed  when  deferiprone  was  used  in 
association.  3  caused  by  agranulocytosis  with  DFP+DFO  and  4  caused  by  cardiac  complications 
including  one  with  DFP+DFX  and  3  with  DFP+DFO.  Thus,  whatever  the  iron  chelators  associated,  we 
cannot totally exclude that this potential risk remains. There is a need for much attention to this risk 
when deferiprone is used in combination which must appear in The SmPC.  
Combination is necessarily associated with the addition of side effects.

A  list  of  ADRs  from  Apopharma  database  that  compares  the  proportion  of  ADRs  between  deferiprone 
monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  was  provided.  Data  from  pooled  safety  database  from  clinical 
trials  (244  patients-year  exposed  for  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  1343  patients-year  exposed  to 
Ferriprox  and  deferoxamine)  showed  statistically  significant  (p<0.05)  differences  in  the  incidence  of 
adverse  reactions  based  on  SOC  for  “Cardiac  disorders",  "Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue 
disorders” and "Renal and urinary disorders". The incidences of “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders”  and  "Renal  and  urinary  disorders"  were  lower  during  combination  therapy  than 
monotherapy,  whereas  the  incidence  of  “Cardiac  disorders"  was  higher  during  combination  therapy 
than  monotherapy.  The  higher  rate  of  “Cardiac  disorders"  reported  during  combination  therapy  than 
monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who 
received combination therapy. 
In  consequence,  the  Rapporteurs  propose  to  modify  the  SmPC  in  order  to  include  precaution  for  use 
related to cardiac disorders (see section 4.4). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In  the  safety  profile  of  DFP-DFO  combination  provided  by  the  MAH,  only  18  children  have  been 
exposed to the combination. Thus, it is very difficult to draw any sound conclusion on these findings. 
However,  the  number  of  children  treated  with  the  combination  and  the  incidence  of  adverse  events 
have been documented in the SmPc (section 4.8). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
The Benefit /Risk Balance of the deferiprone-deferoxamine combination in patients with thalassaemia 
major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-
threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive 
correction  - is considered positive.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
No new data were provided with this type II variation. The data filed under variation II/16 were 
previously fully reviewed under the follow-up measures (FUM) number 005 and 006. 
The two studies in this application include 10PN-PD-DIT-015 and 10PN-PD-DIT-016. 
10PN-PD-DIT-015 was an open controlled study with three parallel groups The safety and 
immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib following a 3-dose primary 
vaccination schedule (2, 4, 6 months) in preterm versus full term born subjects less than 6 months of 
age was evaluated.  
10PN-PD-DIT-016 was the booster vaccination study of study 015. It was a phase III open study 
conducted to assess the safety and immunogenicity following a booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT co-
administered with a booster dose of DTPa-IPV/Hib in preterm born children at 16-18 months of age 
following primary immunisation in study -015 (see Figure 1 and Table 1 for study details).

Clinical aspects 
III.3.2 
Clinical efficacy 
Methods 
Assays used to assess anti-pneumococcal antibodies 
All serological assays used to evaluate the anti-pneumococcal antibody and Opsonophagocytic assay 
(OPA) responses were performed in GSK Biologicals’ laboratory, using standardized and validated 
procedures with adequate controls. 
Antibody concentrations as measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and OPA 
against all vaccine serotypes and vaccine related serotypes 6A and 19A were evaluated in both studies.  
In both studies, the analysis of the immunogenicity was performed according to each of the groups 
(Preterm I, Preterm II and Full term) on the According-to Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity 
(primary analysis), and in study 016 on the ATP cohort for persistence. In addition, in study 015 this 
analysis of immunogenicity was also performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort, as more than 5% of 
the vaccinated subjects were excluded from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
The immune responses to the pneumococcal serotypes were measured by  
1.  ELISA against the 10 vaccine serotypes and the vaccine related serotypes 6A and 19A. The 
percentages of subjects reaching an antibody concentration of 0.20 g/ml and the geometric 
mean concentrations (GMCs) were evaluated one month after completion of the primary 
vaccination in study 015, and were evaluated pre- and one month post-booster vaccination in 
study 016, and  
2.  OPA against the 10 vaccine serotypes. The percentage of subjects reaching an OPA titre of at least 
8 and the geometric mean OPA titres (GMT) were evaluated one month after completion of the 
primary vaccination in study 015, and were evaluated one month post-booster vaccination in 
study 016.  
ELISA for measurement of anti-protein D IgG antibodies 
Anti-protein D antibodies were measured using an ELISA assay developed by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH). The concentration of specific Protein D antibody was determined using a 
reference serum. The cut-off of the assay was 100 EL.U/mL. 
Assays used to assess the immune response to concomitant vaccines 
All assays used to evaluate the immune response to co-administered antigens were performed at GSK 
Bio laboratory using standarized validated procedures with adequate controls. 
The immune responses to co-administered vaccine antigens were measured by  
1.  ELISA against the Hib polysaccharide polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP). The assay cut-off was 
0.15 µg/mL. 
2.  ELISA against pertussis components pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and 
pertactin (PRN). The cut-off of the test was 5 EL.U/mL.

3.  ELISA against the diphtheria and tetanus components and expressed in IU/mL, with respect to a 
reference serum. It is generally accepted that for both diphtheria and tetanus, antibody 
concentrations 0.01 IU/mL, as measured by in vivo neutralisation tests, are protective. An 
antibody concentration of 0.1 IU/mL by ELISA (corresponding to approximately 3 times the lower 
quantitation limit of the assays) was arbitrarily and conservatively set as the cut-off (for both anti-
diphtheria and anti-tetanus ELISAs). 
4.  Virus micro-neutralisation test adapted from the World Health Organisation Guidelines for 
WHO/EPI Collaborative Studies on Poliomyelitis - Standard Procedure for Determining Immunity to 
Poliovirus using the Microneutralization Test (WHO/EPI/GEN 93.9) was used to assess the 
antibodies against polio virus types 1, 2 and 3. The lowest dilution at which serum samples were 
tested was 1/8, from which a test was considered positive. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal 
of the highest dilution of serum showing 50% virus neutralising effect. 
5.  ELISA (developed by GSK Bio) against the Hepatitis B component of the vaccine was used to 
measure the antibodies to the HBs antigen. Concentrations of 10 mIU/mL were considered as 
protective. 
Study populations 
Total vaccinated cohort 
 
The Total Vaccinated cohort (TVC) included all vaccinated subjects. The TVC for analysis of 
safety included all subjects with at least one vaccine administration documented and the TVC 
for analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning 
immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The TVC analysis was performed per 
treatment actually administered. 
ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary study population) 
 
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those 
meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the 
protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning 
immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. This cohort included subjects for whom 
assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen 
component after vaccination 
ATP cohort for antibody persistence (Study 10PN-PD-DIT-016 only) 
 
The ATP cohort for analysis of antibody persistence included all subjects included in the ATP 
cohort for analysis of safety for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at 
least one study vaccine antigen component for the blood sampling taken before the 
administration of the study booster dose (pre-booster blood sampling 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
The primary vaccination and booster studies were conducted in healthy preterm and full term male and 
female children. In study 015, all preterm infants had to be medically stable to be enrolled (medically 
stable refers to the condition of premature infants who do not require significant medical support or 
ongoing management for debilitating disease and who have demonstrated a clinical course of sustained 
recovery). Exclusion criteria used in the studies aimed to prevent administration of the vaccines to 
those individuals with medical conditions that might potentially interfere with the evaluation of the 
immune response; to those individuals in whom previous exposure to the vaccine antigens through 
vaccination or disease would prevent interpretation of the results and to those individuals at risk of 
possible adverse reactions to the vaccine.

Results 
Subject eligibility and attrition from the studies 
In study 10PN-PD-DIT-015, a total of 286 subjects were enrolled (50 subjects in the Preterm I 
group, 87 subjects in the Preterm II group and 149 subjects in the Full term group) and received at 
least one dose of study vaccine. A total of 270 subjects (94.4%) (48 subjects in the Preterm I group, 
83 subjects in the Preterm II group and 139 subjects in the Full term group) completed the study. One 
subject in the preterm I group was withdrawn due to a SAE. 
Out of the 286 subjects in the Total vaccinated cohort, 281 (98.3%) met the eligibility criteria for the 
inclusion in the ATP cohort for safety and 256 (89.5%) met the eligibility criteria for the inclusion in the 
ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The most common reason for elimination from the ATP cohort was 
serological data missing (n=17). 
Among the 286 subjects vaccinated in the primary vaccination study 015 and planned to be enrolled in 
the booster study 10PN-PD-DIT-016, 245 (85.7%) subjects participated in the booster vaccination 
study (44 out of 50 in the Preterm I group, 72 out of 87 in the Preterm II group and 129 out of 149 in 
the Full term group). Forty-one subjects (6 in the Preterm 1 group, 15 in the Preterm II group and 20 
in the Full term group) did not participate in the booster vaccination study. The most common reasons 
for not participating were 1) subjects were not willing to participate (n=24), and 2) subjects lost to 
follow-up (n=15). Among these, 1 subject died during the primary vaccination study  
Out of the 245 subjects enrolled in study 016, 234 (95.5%) completed the active phase of the study 
and 229 (93.5%) subjects were contacted during the extended safety follow-up. Out of the 245 
subjects in the Total vaccinated cohort, 245 (100%) met the eligibility criteria for the inclusion in the 
ATP cohort for safety/persistence and 240 (98.0%) met the eligibility criteria for the inclusion in the  
ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
Demographic characteristics 
Both studies were conducted in Greece and Spain with ~ 40% of subjects enrolled in Greek study 
centres and ~60% in Spanish study centres overall.  
In study 015, the age of infants at first vaccination ranged from 7 - 23 weeks. The mean weight at first 
vaccination was 3.1 kg in the Preterm I group, 4.2kg in the Preterm II group and 5.2kg in the Full term 
group. The mean weight at birth was 1.2 kg in the Preterm I group, 2.0kg in the Preterm II group and 
3.2kg in the Full term group. The mean gestational age was 28.6 weeks in the Preterm I group, 33.5 
weeks in the Preterm II group.  
In study 10PN-PD-DIT-016, the mean age at booster vaccination was 16.8 months; with ages ranging 
from 16-19 months.  
The majority (>88%) of subjects who participated in the primary and booster clinical studies were 
White/Caucasian. Male: Female ratio was approximately 2:3. 
Immunogenicity results 
Immunogenicity results were presented according to the three study groups (treatment allocation 
was1:2:3) 
  Preterm I (PT1): very preterm infants born after a gestation period of 27-30 weeks (189-216 
days). 
  Preterm II (PT2): mild preterm infants born after a gestation period of 31-36 weeks (217-
258 days).

Study 10PN-PD-DIT 015 - Primary vaccination 
ELISA results  
The GMCs of antibodies against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and the percentage of subjects 
with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 μg/ml one month post-dose 3 are presented in Figures 1 and 2.  
For the Full term group, for each of the vaccine serotypes, one month post-dose 3, at least 93.9% of 
the subjects had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/ml.  
For the PT1 group, at least 92.7% of the subjects had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/ml. Antibody 
GMCs were numerically lower for all serotypes in the PT1 group (except for serotype 14 vs. PT 2) and 
highest in the Full term group. The antibody GMCs were significantly lower for serotypes 4, 5 and 9V in 
the PT1 group compared to the Full term group (no overlap of 95% CIs). 
For the PT2 group, at least 95.1% of the subjects had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/ml. The GMCs 
were lower for serotype 9V than those in the Full term group (no overlap of 95% CIs).

The immunogenicity results for the pneumococcal antigens and protein D for the Total vaccinated 
cohort were in line with those observed for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
Co-administered vaccines 
All subjects were seroprotected/seropositive for all antibodies against the antigens in the DTPa-HBV 
IPV/Hib vaccine, except one subject in the Preterm I group who was not seroprotected against polio 
type 3. The anti-PRP GMCs were numerically lower in the very preterm group, but for all the other 
antigens the GMC/GMTs were in the same range in all three vaccine groups 
In general, the immunogenicity results for the co-administered antigens, for the Total vaccinated 
cohort were in line with those observed for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. However, in the 
Preterm I group, the percentage of subjects with titres  8 against polio 2 antigens and the GMTs, one 
month post-dose III tended to be lower than those for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT 016 - Booster vaccination 
Persistence of anti-pneumococcal antibodies (ELISA)  
A decline in antibody GMCs was observed in the time period between primary and booster vaccination 
for each of the vaccine serotypes in all three groups. Antibody GMCs observed prior to the booster 
vaccination were in the same range in all three groups for each of the vaccine serotypes except for 
serotype 5 in Preterm I group (0.24 vs. 0.40) and serotype 9V in Preterm II group (0.42 vs. 0.60) 
for which a lower GMC was observed as compared to the Full term group (no overlap of CIs). 
Prior to the booster vaccination 1 approximately 10-12 months post completion of the primary 
vaccination course, at least 95.3% of subjects still had ELISA antibody concentrations ≥ 0.05μg/ml for 
each of the vaccine serotypes except for serotype 1 in all three groups (at least 85.3%) and serotype 4 
in the Preterm I group (93.0%). At least 63% of subjects still had antibody concentrations 
>0.20ug/ml for each of the vaccine serotypes except for serotype 1 (range 37%-44%) and serotype 
4 in Preterm I group (54%) and in Preterm II group (59%). 
Prior to the booster vaccination, at least 76.8% and 65.1% of subjects in each of the three groups still 
had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.05 μg/ml and at least 24% had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20 μg/ml 
against serotype 6A and serotypes 19A, respectively. 
Prior to the booster vaccination, 85.5% of subjects in the Preterm II group and at least 92.7% of 
subjects in the Preterm I group and the Full term group still had anti-PD antibodies ≥ 100 EL.U/ml.

ELISA results 
After the booster dose in study 10PN-PD-DIT-016, there was a robust increase of ELISA antibody GMCs 
observed between the pre- and post booster responses for each vaccine serotype in all infant groups, 
with increases in GMCs of between 5.7 and 23.6 fold, indicative of immunological memory. 
There were no significant differences between groups in post-booster antibody GMCs (all 95% CIs 
overlap) (Figure 5).

OPA results 
There were no significant differences between groups in post-booster OPA GMTs, except for serotype 
5, whose OPA GMTs were lower in Preterm I group compared to Full Term group (no overlap of 95% 
CIs) (Figure 7).

Increases in OPA GMTs post booster were compared to those attained post-primary. Robust increases 
of OPA GMTs were also seen for each vaccine serotype in both the preterm and very preterm groups 
comparing one month post-primary vaccination titres to one month post-booster titres. 
Post booster OPA responses observed in the very preterm and preterm infant groups were in the same 
range as those observed in the full term group, with at least 91.9% of all subjects achieving OPA titres 
≥ 8 for all vaccine serotypes. 
Booster responses and high seroposivity rates were observed post booster for non-vaccine serotypes 
6A and 19A. The post booster antibody GMCs and GMTs did not show significant differences between 
groups (overlap of 95% CI) (Figures 5 and 6). More than 76.2% of all subjects had an ELISA > 
0.2g/ml and more than 57.7% of all subjects had an OPA GMT > 8 for both non-vaccine serotypes 6A 
and 19A .One month post-booster vaccination, all subjects in each of the three groups (except one 
subject in the Full term group) had anti-PD antibodies ≥ 100 EL.U/ml. 
As regards the co-administered vaccine, all subjects were seroprotected/seropositive for all antibodies 
against the antigens in the DTPa- PV/Hib vaccine after the booster dose without any noticeable 
difference between the groups.

Study 015: primary vaccination of preterm born infants 
The most frequently reported local solicited adverse events (AEs) were redness and pain in the pooled 
preterm group and redness followed by swelling in the full term group. The incidence of local and 
general AEs was similar across all infant groups. However, some differences in reactogenicity were 
recorded between the study groups (pooled preterm group compared to the full term group) including 
the incidence of grade 3 fever, the incidence of redness and swelling, and the incidence of any solicited 
or unsolicited general or local AE being higher in the full term group (Figure 8). Two cases of Grade 3 
fever were reported from subjects in the full term group, of which one was assessed by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. The use of any prophylactic antipyretic in relation to 
vaccination was similar in both groups.

During the primary vaccination course 12.4% and 19.0% of doses in the pooled preterm group and full 
term group, respectively, were followed by at least one unsolicited AEs. The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AES were upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the pooled preterm group and injection 
site nodules and URTI in the full term group.  
One fatality was reported during the study. A subject in the Preterm I group died 25 days after the 
third dose of study vaccines. The medical diagnosis was choking due to aspiration and was not 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
A total of 31 subjects (18 (13.1%) infants in the pooled preterm group, and 13 (8.7%) infants in the 
full term group) reported non-fatal SAEs. The SAEs case reports included apnoea, bronchiolitis, 
tracheitis bronchospasm, breath holding and choking. Of these, one subject (from the Preterm group) 
reported a SAE that was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination (i.e. 
pyrexia). All the reported SAEs resolved without sequelae. 
Overall the reactogenicity profile of 10Pn-PD-DiTb as a 3-dose primary vaccination when given to 
preterm infants was as well tolerated as when given to full term infants, and consistent with the safety 
profile observed in previous studies.

Study 016: booster vaccination of preterm born infants 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE in both groups was pain. Lower incidences of redness 
and swelling (any and grade 3) were observed in the pooled Preterm group than in the Full term group 
(no overlap of 95% CI). A maximum of 4.5% of subjects in the pooled Preterm group and 15.6% of 
subjects in the Full term group reported at least one grade 3 solicited local AE, regardless the injection 
site. 
As with the primary vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited general AE post booster 
vaccination in both study groups was irritability. Solicited general AEs were reported within the same 
range in both study groups. Grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported in maximum 1.8% subjects 
across groups and most of these were considered to be causally related to vaccination. A fever > 39°C 
(rectal temperature) was reported in 7.1% subjects in the pooled Preterm group and 4.9% in the Full 
term group. Only one subject in the Full term group reported grade 3 fever (rectal temperature > 40°C) 
which was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
14.7% of subjects in the pooled Preterm group and 18.6% of subjects in the Full term group reported 
at least one unsolicited AE within the 31-day post-vaccination period. Only one subject in the Full term 
group reported at least one grade 3 unsolicited AE, and no SAEs were reported during the active phase 
of the booster study 
Overall incidences of AE (either solicited or unsolicited) tended to be lower in the Preterm pooled 
compared to the Full term group. All SAEs resolved without sequelae. 
Overall the reactogenicity profile of 10Pn-PD-DiT as booster vaccination when given to preterm infants 
was as well tolerated as when given to full term infants, and consistent with the safety profile observed 
in previous studies. 
Assessment of events following administration of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine to preterm infants 
during post-marketing surveillance (PMS) 
Since the launch of Synflorix until 10 June 2010, there have four PMS cases reported in preterm 
infants. Of these reported cases, one case featured the event “apnoea”, one case featured the event 
“Sudden Infant Death Syndrome”, one case featured the event “Crying, Trance” and one case featured 
the event “Convulsion, Gaze palsy, Muscle Spasms, Tremor”. 
The current PMS data do not suggest cases observed in preterms as a particular safety concern or as 
unexpected. 
2.  Discussion and Conclusion 
Study 015 was well conducted and enrolled both very preterm infants born after a gestation period of 
27-30 weeks and mild preterm infants born after a gestation period of 31-36 weeks. Full term infants 
constituted the control group. Antibody response induced by 10Pn-PD-DiT was measured by both 
ELISA and OPA, which is satisfactory.  
The 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine proved to be immunogenic in all three vaccine groups, although 
numerically lower antibody GMCs were observed in the pre-term infant groups compared to the full 
term infants, with statistically significant differences for antibodies against serotypes 4, 5, 7F and 9V in 
the very preterm group. However, differences between groups in terms of percentage of subjects with 
antibody concentrations ≥ 0.20μg/ml remained small. Importantly, OPA responses observed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/830044/2011  
Page 14/16
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preterm I and the Preterm II groups were in the same range as those observed in the Full term group. 
Actually, numerically higher OPA GMTs to some serotypes (serotypes 4, 7F, 14 and 19F) were seen in 
the Preterm 1 group compared with the Full term group. As noted during the registration procedure, 
the OPA responses were very poor for serotypes 1 and 5 (in all vaccine groups). Therefore, the 
Company was asked to submit data from the ongoing booster study (10PN-PD-DIT-016), to ensure 
that the premature infant population achieves a comparable post-booster response as the full term 
infants. 
As regards the co-administered vaccine, all subjects were seroprotected/seropositive for all antibodies 
against the antigens in the DTPa-HBV IPV/Hib vaccine, except one subject in the Preterm I group who 
was not seroprotected against polio type 3. The anti-PRP GMCs were numerically lower in the very 
preterm group, but for all the other antigens the GMC/GMTs were in the same range in all three 
vaccine groups. 
The final safety results of study 10PN-PD-DIT-015 highlighted differences between the study groups as 
the incidence of fever was higher in the pooled Preterm group and the incidence of any solicited or 
unsolicited general or local AE was higher in the Full term group. The use of any or prophylactic 
antipyretic in relation to vaccination was similar in both groups. The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AE in both groups was upper respiratory infections. Altogether 31 subjects reported at least 
one SAE; 18 out of 137 vaccinated subjects in the pooled Preterm group and 13 out of 149 vaccinated 
subjects in the Full term group. Among these one case of pyrexia in the Pre term group was considered 
related to vaccination. The preterm group included one case of apnoea, 3 cases of bronchiolitis, 2 
cases of breath holding, one case of asthma and one case of tracheitis. None of these cases were 
assessed as vaccine related and all resolved without sequele. The SAEs case reports in Full term 
infants included bronchiolitis, tracheitis, bronchospasm, breath holding and choking. Similarly, cases of 
fever convulsions were recorded in the Full term group. The occurrence of apnoea is a specific known 
adverse event especially in premature children, but will also be an imminent risk in the full term 
infants. The CIOMS reports did not include information of gestational time and therefore it was not 
possible to determine whether the reported cases belonged to Preterm group I or II. The current SmPC 
in section 4.4 Special warning and precautions for use appropriately highlights the potential risk of 
apnoea in preterm infants Apnoea and neurological events in relation to vaccination should be 
continuously closely monitored and reported on in future PSURs. 
In conclusion no new significant or clinically relevant adverse events were identified. 
The post-booster study 016 enrolled 95% of 268 subjects primed with 10Pn-PD-DiT in study 015. The 
primary aim was to evaluate whether the immune response of booster dose after 3-dose primary 
vaccination yielded a comparable response in premature infants and in full term infants. Antibody 
response induced by the booster dose was measured by both ELISA and OPA, which is satisfactory. 
However, antibody persistence prior to the booster dose was only tested by ELISA. 
A similar decline in antibody concentrations was seen in all groups for all vaccine serotypes during the 
pre-booster period. The persistence of ELISA IgG antibody concentrations was acceptable in all three 
study groups and for all vaccine serotypes with at least 95.3% of subjects having detectable antibodies 
(>0.05µg/ml) except for serotype 1 (all groups) and serotype 4 (preterm I group). At least 63% had 
antibody concentrations >0.20µg with the exception of serotype 1 (37% of subjects in the Preterm 
group I and 44% in the Full term group). As regards GMCs numerically lower concentrations was 
observed in the pre-term infant groups compared to the full term infants. Only for serotype 5 and 
serotype 9V these differences reached statistical significance (no overlap of 95% CIs) in the preterm 
group I and II, respectively.

One month after the third primary vaccination dose in study 10PN-PD-DIT-015 there was a trend for 
lower antibody GMCs in the preterm infants groups. Antibody GMCs were significantly lower for 
serotypes 4, 5 and 9V in the PT1 group compared to FT group (no overlap of 95% CIs). However, after 
the booster dose robust increase of antibody GMCs was seen for all serotypes without any significant 
differences between groups (all 95% CIs overlap). Overall, the lowest GMCs were noted for serotype 1 
in all groups.  
Importantly, post-booster OPA responses observed in the Preterm I and the Preterm II groups were in 
the same range as those observed in the Full term group. Thus data showed that that the premature 
infants had been adequately primed. As noted during the registration procedure, the OPA responses 
were lowest for serotypes 1 and 5 (in all vaccine groups). However, for serotype 1 a good booster 
response was seen although the GMTs were still low. In this study, the lowest post-booster OPA GMTs 
were observed for serotype 5, which was evident in the preterm groups I (GMT 69) and II (GMT 120). 
However, still 94% and 96% of these subject, respectively, attained the OPA threshold >8. 
As regards the co-administered vaccine all subjects were seroprotected/seropositive for all antibodies 
against the antigens in the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine after the booster dose without any noticeable 
difference between the groups. 
In conclusion the results in study 016 showed that a booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine at Month 
16-18 induced satisfactory immune responses against all vaccine serotypes and in all vaccine groups 
including the preterm children.  The lowest functional immune responses were observed for serotypes 
1 and 5, which were somewhat more pronounced in the very preterm infants. Still the majority of 
these subjects attained the OPA titre threshold of >8. It can be concluded that the immune responses 
elicited by a fourth dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT in premature infants was comparable to that of full term 
infants and indicate that these infants were adequately primed. 
Study 016 evaluated post-booster responses in preterm infants who are at higher risk of experiencing 
apnoea when receiving vaccination during the first six months of life. At time of the booster dose the 
occurrence of apnoea is of less concern and no such event was recorded in the study.  
Some differences were recorded between the study groups as the incidence of fever >39oC was higher 
in the pooled Preterm group (7.1% vs. 4.9%) and the incidence of any solicited or unsolicited general 
or local AE was higher in the Full term group. Few grade 3 systemic events were reported. The use of 
any or prophylactic antipyretics in relation to vaccination was similar in both groups. It is of note that 
the overall incidence of fever >39oC was lower after primary vaccination (1% in the pooled preterm 
group and 2.1% in the Full term group) than that noted following the booster dose. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AE in both groups was upper respiratory infections or 
tonsillitis. No SAE was reported during the active study phase whereas 4 SAEs were reported during 
the follow-up safety phase. All of these SAEs were considered unrelated to vaccination.  
CHMP concluded that no safety concerns were identified during this booster study.   
On 16 December 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Update section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include information on preterm infants based on the 
data provided in response to FUM 005 and FUM 006 that have been assessed by the Rapporteur and 
reviewed by the CHMP.

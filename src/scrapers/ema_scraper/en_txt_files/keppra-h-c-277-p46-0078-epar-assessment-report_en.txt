Introduction 
On April 2nd 2015, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for study NO1367, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical clinical overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study NO1367 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study medication was provided as levetiracetam (LEV) 500mg tablets. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Description of the study 
Title:  
“A Multi-center, Open-label, Randomized Study to Evaluate the Long Term Effectiveness of 
Levetiracetam as Monotherapy in Comparison with Oxcarbazepine in Subjects With Newly or Recently 
Diagnosed Partial Epilepsy”

Treatment 
Oral tablets of LEV (250mg and 500mg), as the test product and oral tablets of OXC (150mg and 
300mg), as the reference product were used in this study.

Results 
Subject disposition 
Overall, a total of 353 subjects were randomized in N01367 (175 subjects to LEV and 178 subjects to 
OXC) and 243 subjects (68.8%) completed the study. Of the 110 subjects (31.2%) who discontinued 
from the study, the most common reasons for discontinuation were consent withdrawn (40 subjects 
EMA/348791/2015  
Page 6/12 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[11.3%]) and AEs (31 subjects [8.8%]). Subjects in each treatment group discontinued from the study 
at a similar incidence; however, slightly higher percentages of subjects in the OXC group discontinued 
due to consent withdrawn and AEs compared with the LEV group (14.0% and 11.2% vs 8.6% and 
6.3%, respectively). 
Paediatric subjects 
A total of 14 subjects were <18 years old at study entry (8 subjects were 17 years old; 6 were 
16 years old). Eight of these subjects were female; 6 were male. Eight subjects were randomized 
to LEV and 6 to OXC.

In the LEV group, 2 subjects discontinued due to withdrawal of consent, 1 subject discontinued due to 
a protocol violation, and 1 subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy; the other 4 subjects who 
received LEV completed the study. In the OXC group, 1 subject discontinued due to withdrawal of 
consent, 1 subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and 1 subject discontinued due to AE; the other 
3 subjects in the OXC group completed the study.

Paediatric subjects 
Eight of the 14 subjects <18 years old (4 subjects in the OXC group and 4 subjects in the LEV group) 
had TEAEs. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, not related to study medication, and 
resolved. 
There were no deaths or SAEs in subjects aged <18 years. One subject (Subject 010-03452) in the 
OXC group discontinued due to an AE of rash; no subjects in the LEV group discontinued due to an AE. 
A full narrative for this subject is provided in Section 12 of the N01367 CSR. 
Conclusion 
• 
• 
LEV monotherapy treatment at doses from 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day was noninferior to 
OXC monotherapy at doses from 900mg/day to 2400mg/day with respect to long-term 
effectiveness in Korean subjects aged ≥16 years recently diagnosed with partial onset seizures. 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety 
concerns were identified in this study. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Results from N01367 show that LEV monotherapy treatment at doses from 1000mg/day to 
3000mg/day was noninferior to OXC monotherapy at doses from 900mg/day to 2400mg/day with 
respect to long-term effectiveness in Korean subjects aged ≥16 years recently diagnosed with partial 
onset seizures. 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study.

The MAH considers that no changes to the approved EU Product Information for Keppra are proposed 
following the completion of this study.  
At this time, the MAH considers that the standard immediate-release formulations of Keppra allow for 
appropriate use of LEV in paediatric patients in the EU. This study was solely submitted in accordance 
with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
Recommendation  
The Rapporteur endorses the submission of this study in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation and confirms that there is no impact on either the Product Information or on the benefit-
risk balance of the EU authorized formulations. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required

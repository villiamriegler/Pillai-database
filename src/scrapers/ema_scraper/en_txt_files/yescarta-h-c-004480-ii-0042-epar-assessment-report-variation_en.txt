2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Follicular  lymphoma  (FL)  is  the  most  common  indolent  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)  with  increasing 
occurrence (1/100.000; ESMO 2020). The median age of diagnosis is approx. 60 years of age; however, 
occurrence  in  younger  age  is  possible  (J  Clin  Exp  Hematop,  Vol  54,June  2014).  FL  develops  due  to 
proliferation of neoplastic germinal center B cells, both centrocytes (small to medium sized cleaved cells) 
and centroblasts (large non-cleaved cells) that have a follicular pattern of growth (Kahl 2016). FL is subject 
of  various  classifications  according  to  the  proportion  of  centroblastic  cells,  molecular  genetics, 
immunhistochemics and clinical appearance. The current WHO edition defines FL in accordance to number 
of centroblastic cells as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3A and Grade 3B. The distinction between Grade 3A and 
3B is important due to their apparent differences in molecular genetics and prognosis; it is suggested that 
Grade 3A FL (no centrocytes, centroblasts only) is on the same spectrum as Grade 1-2 FL, and Grade 3B 
FL behaves as de novo DLBCL (Katzenberger et al., Am J Pathol 2004; Karube et al., Blood 2007). Clinical 
classification and score grading are the Ann Arbor classification, which specifies stage I-IV based on lymph 
node  regions  and  class  A  (without  symptoms)  and  B  (with  symptoms),  and  the  Follicular  Lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index (FLIPI from the pre-rituximab era and FLIPI2 for rituximab-treated patients), 
which  is  used  for  the  stratification  of  patients  into  low-,  intermediate-,  or  high-risk  groups.  The 
clinicogenetic risk score m7-FLIPI, published 2015 in Lancet Oncology by Pastore A et al., is based on FLIPI 
score and mutation status of seven candidate genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP and 
CARD11). Based on an observation of clinical characteristics of 95 patients with FL, Lockmer et al., BJHaem 
2019 concluded, however that the prognostic factor may be different when applied in a context of different 
therapeutically agents.  
Treatment 
The heterogeneity of FL in terms of clinical, histological and molecular-genetic presentation both at initial 
diagnosis and increasingly in the course of the disease, which is highly variable both between patients and 
intra-patient  (Kahl&Yang,  2016;  Fredman,  2018;  Lockmer  at  al.)  due  to  the  risk  of  histological 
transformations, explains the challenges, clinicians are facing. Although there are numerous therapeutically 
options, there seems to be a lack of robust tools for initiation of the right treatment regimen to the right 
time.  
Newly diagnosed, low-grade, limited stage FL is often responsive to first-line treatments. Advanced stage 
FL  generally  requires  multiple  successive  lines  of  therapy  leading  to  shorter  remission  periods,  chemo-
refractory  disease  and  transformation  to  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  (about  40%  of  all  FL 
patients).  Transformed  follicular  lymphomas  (tFL)  have  a  worse  prognosis  due  to  poorer  response  to 
treatment than primary DLBCL. Surgery is not used as a general treatment option; however, removing of 
symptomatic limited affected organs/tissue may be useful in some cases.  
For  patients  with  limited  low  tumor  burden  stages  I-II,  a  radiotherapy-based  treatment  with  or  without 
combination with rituximab is clinical standard followed by consolidation/maintenance, e. g. with rituximab 
for 2 years. Myeloablative consolidation followed by ASCT prolongs PFS, but advantage on OS has not been

observed  (Schaaf  et  al,  Cochrane  Database  Syst  Rev  2012).  Patients  in  advanced  stages  of  FL  or  cases 
where  radiotherapy  is  not  feasible  are  treated  with  systemic  (combined)  chemo-immunotherapy, 
immunomodulatory  agents  and  phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase  (PI3K)  inhibitors.  Complete  response  (CR) 
rates are low, however, ranging from 1% to 14% (Dreyling 2017). Autologous (auto-SCT) and allogeneic 
stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) may benefit only a small fraction of patients. Therefore, most of the patients 
will  experience  disease  progression,  relapse  or  refractory  disease,  and  prognoses  for  these  patients  are 
poor.  Despite  the  advances  in  the  treatment  of  FL,  there  is  an  unmet  need  for  patients  with  refractory 
and/or relapsed FL, who failed on available therapies.

Claimed therapeutic indication 
The claimed indication is: “Yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after three or more lines of systemic therapy”. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
FL is a systemic neoplasm of the lymphoid tissue displaying germinal centre (GC) B cell differentiation. The 
tumorigenesis starts in precursor B cells and becomes full tumour when the cells reach the GC maturation 
step. FL is preceded by an asymptomatic preclinical phase in which premalignant B cells carrying a t(14;18) 
reciprocal chromosomal translocation develop additional genetic alterations, although not all of these cells 
progress to the tumour phase. The aetiology of FL is unknown; family history is important (Br J Haematol 
2009) and t(14;18) alone is considered not sufficient to cause FL (Haematologica, 2014).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous CAR T-cell product in which a subject’s T cells are engineered to 
express receptors consisting of a single-chain antibody fragment against CD19 linked to CD3ζ and CD28 T-
cell activating domains that result in elimination of CD19-expressing cells {Jackson 2016, Roberts 2018}. 
Following CAR engagement with CD19+ target cells, the CD3ζ domain activates the downstream signaling 
cascade  that  leads  to  T-cell  activation,  proliferation,  and  acquisition  of  effector  functions,  such  as 
cytotoxicity  {Roberts  2018}.  The  intracellular  signaling  domain  of  CD28  provides  a  costimulatory  signal 
that works in concert with the primary CD3ζ signal to augment T-cell function, including interleukin (IL)-2 
production  {Finney  1998}.  Together,  these  signals  stimulate  proliferation  of  the  CAR  T  cells  and  direct 
killing of target cells. In addition, activated T cells secrete cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that 
can recruit and activate additional antitumor immune cells {Restifo 2012}. 
Yescarta was approved in 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines 
of systemic therapy. A single dose of Yescarta contains 2 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg of body 
weight (or maximum of 2 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 
68 mL dispersion in an infusion bag. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.2.  Quality aspects  
No changes are proposed for the manufacturing of the medicinal product, which is therefore considered to 
be the same, including all DS and DP specifications. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
One additional non-clinical genotoxicity study has been submitted in the application. The genotoxic potential 
of axicabtagene ciloleucel is related to the risk of insertional oncogenesis as a result of vector integration 
into the genome of T cells. The risk of insertional oncogenesis is not affected by the proposed extension of 
indication.  
The  risk  of  insertional  oncogenesis  has  previously  been  assessed  by  literature  review  and  the  clinical 
experience gained with administration of human T cells that were transduced with γ-retroviral vectors. The 
newly submitted non-clinical genotoxicity study investigated the vector integration sites (VIS) in anti-CD19 
CAR T cells generated using the KTE-C19 manufacturing process and T cells from three healthy donors. The 
data revealed an even VIS diversity for all three donors at the end of manufacturing. No over-represented 
VIS  could  be  detected  suggesting  that  no  transduced  T-cell  clone  had  acquired  a  significant  growth 
advantage resulting from the integration event.

2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not affected by the proposed extension of indication. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The additional non-clinical data do not raise any concerns and complement the literature review and 
clinical experience gained so far. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
General  
Methods, endpoints and objectives for primary/secondary Analysis on PK/PD  
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for axicabtagene ciloleucel in this application are based 
on 1 clinical study: KTE-C19-105 (ZUMA-5). ZUMA-5 is a Phase 2, multicenter, ongoing open-label study 
evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with r/r B-cell iNHL of FL or MZL histological 
subtypes.  Evaluations  of  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
were included as secondary endpoints. The results on PD are provided in the primary analysis report with 
the data cutoff date of 12 March 2020 only, and PK-parameters are evaluated and provided both in the 
primary analysis report with the data cutoff date of 12 March 2020 and in the 18-months analysis addendum 
with  DCO  14  September  2020.  The  assessments  were  based  on  known  or  hypothesized  aspects  of  the 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  mechanism  of  action,  and  the  current  knowledge  of  the  safety  profile  of  the 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen and of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. The number, frequency, 
and  timing  of  blood  or  serum  samples  collected  for  PK  and  PD  analyses  were  based  on  the  expected 
concentration-time profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Presented subgroup analyses should be considered 
descriptive only, as the study was not designed to test for differences between groups.   
The safety analysis set was used for summary analyses of PK and PD and correlation to safety outcomes. 
At the cut-off date of 12 March 2020 and 14 September 2020, the safety analysis set comprised respectively 
146 and 148 subjects with iNHL treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel, including 124 subjects 
with FL and 22 (24 for 18-month update) subjects with MZL.  
The inferential analysis set was used for correlation to clinical efficacy outcomes. The inferential analysis 
set comprised 104 subjects, including 84 subjects with FL and 20 subjects with MZL.  
Assessments at the time of the primary analysis (data cut-off date of 12 March 2020) included presence, 
expansion, and persistence of gene-marked anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood (PK parameters), levels of B 
cells in blood over time (to monitor on-target/off-tumor effect), and levels of key soluble analytes (cytokines 
and chemokines) in serum over time (PD parameters). Exploratory correlative analyses of PK and PD results 
with baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were also performed.  
The  presence,  expansion,  and  persistence  of  anti-CD19  chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  T  cells  were 
measured  in  cryopreserved  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  derived  from  whole  blood  of 
subjects treated in ZUMA-5. Serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a validated 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. The qPCR assay was based on the method developed 
by Kochenderfer and colleagues {Kochenderfer 2012, Kochenderfer 2015, Kochenderfer 2017a} and was 
further optimized and validated by the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) Central Lab Services. 
The qPCR assay was demonstrated to be specific for cells with a stably integrated anti-CD19 CAR transgene. 
The  lower  limit  of  detection  was  established  at  1  cell  equivalent  per  100,000 PBMCs  (0.001%),  and  the 
lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  was  established  at  8  to  110  cell  equivalents  per  100,000  PBMCs 
depending on DNA sample load.

Sample sizes are based on a data cutoff date of 12 March 2020 for primary analysis. 
Among subjects with FL, the median weight-adjusted dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel was 2.0 x 106 anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg (range: 1.3 x 106 to 2.1 x 106 cells/kg). Among subjects with MZL, the median weight-adjusted dose of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel was 2.0 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (range: 1.6 x 106 to 2.0 x 106 cells/kg) 
Results on Pharmacokinetics 
 Pharmacokinetic results over time are shown in Table 3.  Of the 114 subjects evaluable at Month 3, 15 
(12.10%) had anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels below the LLOQ, ie, no cells detected. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
remain detectable at Month 6 in the majority of subjects with evaluable samples at the time of the data 
cutoff date (83 of 106 subjects, 66.94%). Anti-CD19 CAR T cells remain detectable at Month 12 in 65 of 85 
subjects (52.42%) with evaluable samples at the time of the data cutoff date. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells remain 
detectable at Month 18 in 26 of 36 subjects (20.92%) with evaluable samples at the time of the data cutoff 
date. At Month 24, anti-CD19 CAR T cells were detectable in 18 of 25 subjects (14.52%) with evaluable 
samples at the time of the data cutoff date (14 Sep 2020).

Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations and Subgroups  
ZUMA-5 was not designed to test for differences between subgroups and formal comparisons were not 
prespecified. The statistical results of the subgroup analyses are descriptive in nature. 
Age 
Pediatric subjects were not enrolled. Among subjects with FL, 86 evaluable subjects were < 65 years of 
age and 38 subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. For subjects < 65 years of age, the median peak anti-CD19 
CAR  T-cell  level  and  AUC0-28  were  36.90  cells/μL  (range:  1.05  to  1415.40  cells/μL)  and  410.75 
cells/μL•days (range: 10.91 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days), respectively. For subjects ≥ 65 years of age, the 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level and AUC0-28 were 35.73 cells/μL (range: 0.49 to 1026.32 cells/μL) 
and  459.84  cells/μL•days  (range:  5.93  to  7996.06  cells/μL•days),  respectively.  Anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells 
remain detectable at Month 12 in 65 of 85 subjects (52.42%) with evaluable samples at the time of the 
data cut-off date.  
Gender 
Among  subjects  with  FL,  51  subjects  were  female  and  73  subjects  were  male.  For  female  subjects,  the 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level and AUC0-28 were 37.62 cells/μL (range: 0.49 to 529.57 cells/μL) 
and  473.27  cells/μL•days  (range:  5.93  to  5985.07  cells/μL•days),  respectively.  For  male  subjects,  the 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level and AUC0-28 were 35.37 cells/μL (range: 1.05 to 1415.40 cells/μL) 
and 406.83 cells/μL•days (range: 10.91 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days), respectively. 
Race 
Among subjects with FL, 115 subjects were white, 4 subjects were black or African American, 2 subjects 
were Asian, and 3 subjects self-reported their race as other. For white subjects, the median peak anti-CD19 
CAR  T-cell  level  and  AUC0-28  were  35.37  cells/μL  (range:  0.49  to  1415.40  cells/μL)  and  410.63 
cells/μL•days  (range:  5.93  to  1.99  x  104  cells/μL•days),  respectively.  In  the  9  nonwhite  subjects,  peak 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  ranged  from  1.80  to  696.83  cells/μL,  and  AUC0-28  ranged  from  23.61  to 
5247.56 cells/μL•days.

Baseline tumor burden 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized by baseline tumor burden per central assessment. Tumor 
burden  was  measured  as  the  sum  of  the  cross  product  diameters  of  target  lesions,  ie,  the  sum  of  the 
products  of  the  longest  perpendicular  diameters  of  tumors  (SPD),  per  the  International  Working  Group 
(IWG)  Lugano  Classification  {Cheson  2014}.  The  association  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  expansion  with 
baseline  tumor  burden  was  assessed  according  to  quartiles  of  SPD  as  well  as  by  median  SPD.  Among 
subjects with FL, median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 35.78 cells/μL in the first (lowest) tumor 
burden quartile, 60.13 cells/μL in the second quartile, 31.62 cells/μL in the third quartile, and 31.31 cells/μL 
in the fourth (highest) quartile. Median values for AUC0-28 were 422.37 cells/μL•days in the first quartile, 
528.76  cells/μL•days  in  the  second  quartile,  364.55  cells/μL•days  in  the  third  quartile,  and  249.73 
cells/μL•days in the fourth quartile (Table 4).  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were also summarized for subgroups of subjects with baseline tumor SPD ≤ 
median as compared to subjects with SPD > median (Table 5). For subjects with FL with SPD ≤ median, 
the  median  peak  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  level  and  AUC0-28  were  42.46  cells/μL  (range:  1.08  to  1026.32 
cells/μL) and 451.17 cells/μL•days (range: 19.08 to 7996.06 cells/μL•days), respectively. For subjects with 
SPD > median, the median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level and AUC0-28 were 31.46 cells/μL (range: 0.49 
to 1415.40 cells/μL) and 331.09 cells/μL•days (range: 5.93 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days), respectively.

Impact of concomitant use of tocilizumab and/or systemic corticosteroids 
Among  subjects  with  FL,  18  subjects  (14.5%)  received  tocilizumab  alone,  12  subjects  (9.7%)  received 
corticosteroids alone, 38 subjects (30.6%) received both tocilizumab and corticosteroids, and 56 subjects 
(45.2%)  received  neither  tocilizumab  nor  corticosteroids.  The  timing  and  dose  of  corticosteroids 
administered following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion were variable. Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell 
levels and AUC0-28 were progressively higher in the following order: the lowest expansion was in subjects 
who  received  neither  tocilizumab  nor  corticosteroids  (peak:  21.38  cells/μL;  AUC0-28:  221.28 
cells/μL•days); similar expansion was observed in subjects who received either tocilizumab alone (peak: 
25.71 cells/μL; AUC0-28: 373.54 cells/μL•days) or corticosteroids alone (peak: 29.64 cells/μL; AUC0-28: 
468.05  cells/μL•days);  the  highest  expansion  was  in  subjects  who  received  both  tocilizumab  and 
corticosteroids (peak: 120.39 cells/μL; AUC0-28: 1120.29 cells/μL•days). 
B-cell levels (on-target off-tumor toxicity) 
B cell levels were calculated as a percentage of CD19+, CD20+, or CD19+CD20+ B cells relative to viable 
CD45+ leukocytes in a flow cytometry assay. Among subjects with FL, 85 of 112 subjects (75.9%) in the 
safety analysis set had detectable B cells at baseline (enrollment/leukapheresis), with a median B cell level 
of 4.84% of viable leukocytes (range: 0.02% to 78.34%). At Month 3, the first time point at which B cells 
were measured after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, 41 of 102 subjects (40.2%) had detectable B cells, 
and the median B cell level declined to 0.47% (range: 0.02% to 47.35%). At Month 12, of 74 subjects 42 
subjects  (56.8%)  with  evaluable  samples  had  detectable  B  cells  (median:  6.53%,  range:  0.03%  to 
48.49%). At Month 18, 24 of 35 subjects (68.57%) with evaluable samples had detectable B cells (median, 
11.84%; range: 0.03% to 43.91%). At Month 24, 12 of 20 subjects (60.0%) with evaluable samples had 
detectable B cells (median, 9.05%; range: 0.14% to 46.06%).

Associations of PK with key efficacy and safety endpoints 
Objective Response 
Among 84 subjects with FL in the inferential analysis set, 79 subjects (94.0%) had an objective response 
(CR or PR) and 3 subjects (3.6%) were nonresponders. One subject who had died prior to the first scheduled 
disease  assessment  was  excluded  from  the  analysis,  and  1  subject  was  excluded  due  to  undefined/no 
disease response by central assessment. Due to the limited number of nonresponders, no formal statistical 
comparisons were performed. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in responders (n=112) versus 
nonresponders (n=5) were 38.0cells/μL (range: 0.49 to 1415.40 cells/μL) and 31.3 cells/μL (range: 1.80 
to  60.24  cells/μL),  respectively.  The  median  AUC0-28  in  responders  versus  nonresponders  was  454.8 
cells/μL•days (range: 5.93 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days) and 247.14 cells/μL•days (range: 23.61 to 804.42 
cells/μL•days), respectively.  
Best Overall Response 
Among 84 evaluable subjects with FL, 67 subjects (79.8%) achieved a best response of CR, 12 subjects 
(14.3%) achieved PR, and 3 subjects (3.6%) were nonresponders per central read. Neither peak nor AUC0-
28 were significantly different between the CR and PR groups. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels 
in subjects with CR versus PR were 38.33 cells/μL  (range: 1.05 to 1415.40 cells/μL) and 35.78 cells/μL 
(range: 0.49 to 364.79 cells/μL), respectively (Wilcoxon rank sum nominal p = 0.4403). The median AUC0-
28 in subjects with CR versus PR was 458.37 cells/μL•days (range: 12.00 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days) and 
374.12 cells/μL•days (range: 5.93 to 2800.43 cells/μL•days). In the nonresponder group, the median peak 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level and AUC0-28 were 35.31 cells/μL (range: 1.80 to 60.24 cells/μL) and 247.14 
cells/μL•days (range: 23.61 to 804.42 cells/μL•days), respectively.

Ongoing Response 
Among 84 evaluable subjects with FL, 53 subjects (63.1%) were in ongoing response at the data cutoff 
date,  19  subjects  (22.6%)  had  relapsed,  and  3  subjects  (3.6%)  were  nonresponders.  Neither  peak  nor 
AUC0-28 were significantly associated with ongoing response, although a trend toward higher anti-CD19 
CAR T-cell levels was observed in subjects with durable responses. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell 
levels  in  subjects  with  ongoing  response  versus  relapse  were  42.46  cells/μL  (range:  1.05  to  1415.40 
cells/μL) and 31.87 cells/μL (range: 0.49 to 364.79 cells/μL), respectively. The median AUC0-28 in subjects 
with ongoing response versus relapse was 473.27 cells/μL•days (range: 12.00 to 1.99 x 104 cells/μL•days) 
and 337.61 cells/μL•days (range: 5.93 to 2636.04 cells/μL•days), respectively. In the nonresponder group, 
the  median  peak  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  level  and  AUC0-28  were  35.31  cells/μL  (range:  1.80  to  60.24 
cells/μL) and 247.14 cells/μL•days (range: 23.61 to 804.42 cells/μL•days), respectively.

Associations of PK with CRS and neurologic events 
CRS 
Among 124 evaluable subjects with FL, 8 subjects (6.5%) had Grade 3 or higher CRS and 116 subjects 
(93.5%) had Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 7.7-fold higher 
for subjects with Grade 3 or higher CRS compared with subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS (272.99 
vs 35.34 cells/μL; Wilcoxon rank sum nominal p = 0.0307). Similarly, the median AUC0-28 was 7.7-fold 
higher for subjects with Grade 3 or higher CRS compared with subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS 
(3155.66 vs 408.73 cells/μL•days; Wilcoxon rank sum nominal p = 0.0394).  
Neurologic events 
Among 124 evaluable subjects with FL, 19 subjects (15.3%) had Grade 3 or higher neurologic events, and 
105 subjects (84.7%) had Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-
cell level was 3.7-fold higher for subjects with Grade 3 or higher neurologic events compared with subjects 
with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events (122.85 vs 33.56 cells/μL; Wilcoxon rank sum nominal p = 
0.0053). Similarly, the median AUC0-28 was 2.9-fold higher for subjects with Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
events  compared  with  subjects  with  Grade  2,  Grade  1,  or  no  neurologic  events  (1145.67  vs  394.77 
cells/μL•days; Wilcoxon rank sum nominal p = 0.0022).

Methods 
Please refer to section 2.4.2.  
Levels  of  key  analytes  (pro-inflammatory  and  immune-modulating  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  effector 
molecules) were to be evaluated in serum samples at multiple time points. Assays  for 14 of the 17 key 
analytes have been qualified; assays for granzyme B, perforin and ferritin were performed in accordance 
to  the  manufacturer’s  recommended  protocols.  Analytes  were  to  be  measured  at  baseline 
(enrollment/leukapheresis), Day 0, and on Day 3, Day 7, Week 2, and Week 4 after axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion. The following 17 analytes (preselected from a larger panel of 40 analytes), which are known to be 
involved  in  mediation  the antitumor  activity  of  CAR  T  cells  and  treatment-related  toxicities  according  to 
literature (Kochendorffer 2017a; Neepalu 2017) are presented:

Results 
IL-15 
Serum  IL-15  increased  following  the  administration  of  the  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  regimen,  as 
indicated by elevated levels of IL-15 at Day 0 relative to baseline. At baseline, the median IL-15 level was 
2.10  pg/mL.  At  Day  0,  following  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy,  median  IL-15  levels  had  increased 
approximately 14-fold to 28.90 pg/mL. Levels of IL-15 continued to rise after the infusion of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel,  reaching  a  median  peak  value  of  33.75  pg/mL.  The  median  time  to  peak  was  4  days  after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. A 2-fold or higher change of IL-15 levels at the peak relative to baseline 
was observed in 122 of 124 subjects (98.4%) in the safety analysis set. At Week 4, median IL-15 levels 
declined to 4.10 pg/mL, with 65 of 118 subjects (55.1%) still demonstrating a 2-fold or higher change in 
the level of IL-15 relative to baseline. 
IL-2 
IL-2 levels in the serum increased rapidly after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion in the safety analysis set. 
Median levels of IL-2 at baseline, Day 0, peak, and Week 4 were 0.90 pg/mL (imputed LLOQ), 0.90 pg/mL 
(imputed LLOQ), 3.05 pg/mL, and 0.90 pg/mL (imputed LLOQ), respectively. The median time to peak was 
4 days after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. A 2-fold or higher change of IL-2 levels at the peak relative 
to baseline was observed in 79 of 124 subjects (63.7%) in the safety analysis set. At Week 4, median IL-2 
levels  generally  returned  toward  baseline,  with  2  of  118  subjects  (1.7%)  still  demonstrating  a  2-fold  or 
higher change in the level of IL-2 over baseline. 
IL-7 
 IL-7 increased following the administration of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen, as indicated by 
higher levels of IL-7 at Day 0 relative to baseline. At baseline, the median IL-7 level was 14.85 pg/mL. At 
Day 0, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy, median IL-7 levels had increased approximately 2-fold to 
27.75  pg/mL.  Levels  of  IL-7  continued  to  rise  after  the  infusion  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel,  reaching  a 
median  peak  value  of  31.65  pg/mL.  The  median  time  to  peak  was  4  days  after  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
infusion. A 2-fold or higher change of IL-7 levels at the peak relative to baseline was observed in 69 of 124 
subjects (55.6%) in the safety analysis set. At Week 4, median IL-7 levels declined toward baseline (17.45 
pg/mL), with 10 of 118 subjects (8.5%) still demonstrating a 2-fold or higher change in the level of IL-7 
relative to baseline. 
CRP 
Median serum levels of the acute phase reactant CRP in the safety analysis set at baseline, Day 0, peak, 
and Week 4 were 7.13 mg/L, 15.82 mg/L, 66.97 mg/L, and 0.54 mg/L, respectively. CRP appeared to be 
induced  by  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy,  with  64  of  120  subjects  (52.9%)  demonstrating  a  2-fold  or 
higher  increase  over  baseline  at  Day  0.  The  median  time  to  peak  was  5  days  after  the  infusion  of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. At the peak, 100 of 124 subjects (80.6%) demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change 
EMA/622447/2022

of CRP levels over baseline. CRP levels generally decreased to baseline or below baseline at Week 4, with 
6 of 118 subjects (5.1%) still demonstrating a 2-fold or higher change in the level of CRP over baseline at 
that time. 
IFN-γ  
Median serum levels of IFN-γ in the safety analysis set at baseline,Day 0, peak, and Week 4 were 7.50 
pg/mL  (imputed  LLOQ),  7.50  pg/mL  (imputed  LLOQ),95.50  pg/mL,  and  7.50  pg/mL  (imputed  LLOQ), 
respectively. The median time to peak was 7 days after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. At the peak, 
102 of 124 subjects (82.3%) demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change of IFN-γ levels over baseline. At Week 
4,  40  of  118  subjects  (33.9%)  still  demonstrated  a  2-fold  or  higher  change  in  the  levels  of  IFN-γ  over 
baseline. 
TNF-α 
Median levels of TNF-α in the safety analysis set at baseline, Day 0, peak, and Week 4 were 3.95 pg/mL, 
2.30 pg/mL, 4.60 pg/mL, and 2.10 pg/mL, respectively. The median time to peak was 4 days after infusion 
of axicabtagene ciloleucel. At the peak, 20 of 124 subjects (16.1%) demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change 
of TNF-α levels over baseline. At Week 4, TNF-α levels generally returned toward baseline, with 3 of 118 
subjects (2.5%) still demonstrating a 2-fold or higher increase of TNF-α over baseline. 
CXCL10  
Median  levels  of  CXCL10  in  the  safety  analysis  set  at  baseline,  Day  0,  peak,  and  Week  4  were  343.75 
pg/mL, 395.40 pg/mL, 1077.25 pg/mL, and 400.70 pg/mL, respectively. The median time to peak was 8 
days after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. At the peak, 72 of 124 subjects (58.1%) demonstrated a 2-
fold  or  higher  change  of  CXCL10  levels  over  baseline.  At  Week  4,  24  of  118  subjects  (20.3%)  still 
demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change in the levels of CXCL10 over baseline. 
Granzyme B 
Granzyme B in the safety analysis set at baseline, Day 0, peak, and Week 4 were 1.00 pg/mL (imputed 
LLOQ),  1.00  pg/mL  (imputed  LLOQ),  8.20  pg/mL,  and  1.00  pg/mL  (imputed  LLOQ),  respectively.  The 
median time to peak was 8 days after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. At the peak, 60 of 124 subjects 
(48.4%) demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change of granzyme B levels over baseline. At Week 4, granzyme 
B levels generally returned toward baseline, with 15 of 118 subjects (12.7%) still demonstrating a 2-fold 
or higher increase of granzyme B over baseline. 
Summary of results 
- After lymphodepleting chemotherapy treatment, median serum levels of CRP and IL-15 increased by at 
least 2-fold. Consistent with lymphodepletion, median serum levels of perforin decreased during this same 
time period. 
- On Day 3 after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, median serum levels of the majority of key analytes 
remained  steady  relative  to  baseline  levels  (<  2-fold  change;  CXCL10,  granzyme  B,  ICAM-1,  IL-1RA,  IL 
2Rα, IL-7, TNF-α, and VCAM-1) or were elevated by at least 2-fold relative to baseline (CRP, ferritin, IFN-
γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-15). 
-  With  the  exception  of  perforin,  the  median  time  to  peak  for  all  key  analytes  was  within  8  days  after 
infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel (range of medians: 4 to 8 days), coinciding with the peak anti-CD19 CAR 
T-cell expansion at 8 days; the median time to peak for perforin was 29 days, indicative of endogenous T-
cell  recovery.  The  majority  of  analytes  increased  by  2-fold  or  more  at  peak  in  ≥  50%  of  subjects 
(exceptions: granzyme B, ICAM-1, perforin, TNF-α, and VCAM-1).

- By Week 4 after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, the majority of the 17 key serum analytes had returned 
to near baseline levels, ie, 5 analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (CXCL10, 
ferritin, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-15).

Of  the  17  key  analytes,  the  median  peak  serum  levels  for  the  following  analytes  were  nominally  higher 
among subjects with FL who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS after 
infusion  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel:  CXCL10,  IFN-γ,  IL-1RA,  IL-2,  IL-2Rα,  IL-6,  IL-8,  IL-10,  TNF-α,  and 
VCAM-1.  
The 3 analytes with the lowest p-values for peak serum levels with Grade 3 or higher CRS compared with 
Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS were IL-2, TNF-α and IL-6. These were also the 3 analytes with the greatest 
fold change in median peak serum levels by grade of CRS. 
Neurologic events 
Of  the  17  key  analytes,  the  median  peak  serum  levels  for  the  following  analytes  were  nominally  higher 
among subjects with FL who experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic events versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or 
no neurologic events after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CXCL10, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2Rα,

IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and TNF-α. These analytes also were associated with higher severity CRS with the 
exception of granzyme B and IL-15.  
The 4 analytes with the lowest p-values for peak serum levels with Grade 3 or higher neurologic events 
compared with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events were IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10.  
The 4 analytes with the greatest fold change in median peak serum levels by grade of neurologic events 
were IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2 and Granzyme B. 
Associations of B-cell levels with PK and disease response 
Summary of results 
Subjects with FL who were in ongoing response or whose disease had relapsed by DCO had numerically 
lower median B-cell levels at baseline compared with nonresponders (4.65% and 4.59% versus 11.45%, 
respectively). 
Most subjects who were in ongoing response demonstrated B-cell aplasia at Month 3, with 28 of 44 subjects 
(63.6%) having B-cell levels below the LLOQ of the flow cytometry assay used for evaluation. B-cell levels 
slowly recovered by Month 18, with 5 of 13 subjects (38.5%) having B-cell levels below the LLOQ at that 
time. 
Subjects in ongoing response who had B-cell aplasia (B-cell levels below the LLOQ) had numerically higher 
median  CAR  T-cell  levels  than  subjects  in  ongoing  response  who  did  not  have  B-cell  aplasia  (B  cells 
detectable) at all time points for which data exist, Month 3 to Month 18. 
Anti-CD19 CAR T cells persisted at detectable levels (median CAR T-cell level: 0.01 cells/μL; range: < LLOQ 
to 0.93 cells/μL) in 8 subjects (61.5%) in ongoing response at Month 18 in the presence of recovered B-
cell levels. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the results presented on PK and PD and on measurable associations with both the drug product 
and the clinical parameters on safety and efficacy can be considered in line with current knowledge in the 
pharmacology  of  CAR  T  cell  therapy.  The  observed  variability  in  engraftment  kinetics  is  known  to  be 
multifactorial  (applied  dose,  conditioning  therapy  etc.),  which  might  be  an  explanation  for  the  observed 
differences within defined and between defined groups.  
The relationship between axicabtagene ciloleucel exposure and clinical efficacy is obvious. Interestingly, in 
terms of OR rates, there seem to be no significant differences in the median peak anti-CD19 CAR-T cell 
levels between responders and non-responders in contrast to median AUC0-28 levels, whereas in terms of 
ongoing response, the differences in both median peak CAR T- cell levels and AUC0-28 are obvious.  
Onset  and  severity  of  CRS  and  neurological  events  coincides  with  the  kinetics  of  engraftment  of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and a rise in the concentration of cytokines in the serum. With regard to PK and the 
occurrence of CRS and/or neurological events, higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels (peak and AUC0-28) were 
associated with Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurological events, an observation, which is known according 
to  scientific  publications.  Results  presented  on  PD  and  clinical  safety  endpoints  (CRS  and  neurological 
events) indicate a positive association of most of the 17 key cytokines, chemokines and immune effector 
molecules with higher grade CRS and neurological events, an observation, which is also in compliance with 
current scientific knowledge in the treatment with CAR T-cell products.

Nearly all patients, who experienced tumor response experienced concomitant elimination of non-malignant 
B-cells  (on-target  off-tumor  toxicity).  The  figures  on  the  loss  of  B-cells,  associated  with  decrease  in 
immunoglobulin  concentrations  as  well  as  the  figures  on  the  return  of  B-cells  at  the  subjects  with  FL  in 
ZUMA-5 indicates to be consistent with literature data on CAR T cell therapy.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data provided are presented in a detailed and comprehensive way for the target indication r/r FL. The 
measurement  methods  used  in  ZUMA-5  are  the  commonly  employed  to  track  the  CAR  T  cells  after 
administration, and they appear to show viable correlations.  
The results on PK and PD and on measurable associations with both the drug product and clinical outcome 
can be considered in line with current knowledge in the pharmacology of CAR T cell therapy.

•  Autologous stem cell transplant within 6 weeks of planned axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
•  History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
• 
• 
Prior CD19 targeted therapy with the exception of subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel in 
this study and are eligible for retreatment 
Prior CAR therapy or other genetically modified T-cell therapy 
As  per  protocol  amendment  2  (19  Jan  2018),  the  main  inclusion  criterion  with  regard  to  eligible  iNHL 
histology was revised to limit histologically proven B-cell iNHL to the FL (Grade 1, 2 or 3a) or MZL nodal or 
extranodal histological subtypes based on the WHO 2016 classification and to remove primary relapse and 
relapse  after  ASCT  high  risk  categories  of  iNHL.  An  additional  inclusion  criterion  was  added  to  require 
relapse or refractory disease after 2 or more prior lines of therapy and that prior therapy must have included 
an  anti-CD20  monoclonal antibody  combined  with  an  alkylating  agent  (Single  agent  anti-CD20  antibody 
was not counted as line of therapy for eligibility). Additionally, it was clarified that stable disease (without 
relapse) > 1 year from completion of last therapy is not eligible. Furthermore, the inclusion criterion with 
the requirement of having at least 1 measurable lesion was updated to include the more recent Lugano 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2014). And finally, the requirement for MRI of

the brain to show there is no evidence of CNS lymphoma was removed and replaced by a requirement of 
having no known history or suspicion of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma. 
Diagnosis  of  FL  or  MZL  for  determination  of  study  eligibility  was  made  by  the  investigator  at  each  site. 
Diagnosis was centrally confirmed retrospectively on archival tumor tissue by NeoGenomics Laboratories 
(Irvine,  CA).  The  retrospective  review  of  central  diagnosis  included  assessment  of  CD19  expression. 
Demonstration of CD19 expression was not required for study eligibility. Tumor tissue in the form of an 
archival  formalin-fixed  paraffin  embedded  block,  pre-cut  slides,  or  an  on-study  baseline  (prior  to 
lymphodepletion) biopsy, were to be submitted for the central review.

Axicabtagene Ciloleucel retreatment 
Subjects  who  achieve  a  response of  PR  or  better  at the  3-month disease  assessment,  but  subsequently 
experience disease progression, had the option to receive a second course of conditioning chemotherapy 
and axicabtagene ciloleucel.

• 
• 
• 
•

Subject  has  at  least  PR  or  CR  at  the  Month  3  disease  assessment,  but  subsequently  experienced 
progression of disease at a later time. 
CD19  expression  on  tumor  cells  confirmed  locally  by  biopsy  after  disease  progression  and  prior  to 
treatment 
Subject continues to meet the original study eligibility criteria with the exception of prior axicabtagene 
ciloleucel  use  in  this  study.  Screening  assessments  should  be  repeated  if  clinically  indicated,  as 
determined by the investigator, to confirm eligibility. 
Subject has not received subsequent therapy for the treatment of lymphoma. 
Subject  did  not  experience  Grade  4  CRS,  Grade  4  neurological  event,  or  any  other  life-threatening 
toxicity during the original course of treatment.

Sample size 
Up  to  approximately  160  subjects,  including  up  to  approximately  125  subjects  with  FL  with  at  least  80 
subjects with FL in the inferential analysis set, were to be enrolled and treated. The trial used a single-arm 
design to estimate the ORR in subjects with r/r iNHL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
The primary analysis was to be performed when at least 80 subjects in the FL inferential analysis set had 
had the opportunity to be followed for 12 months after the first disease assessment. The primary efficacy 
endpoint for this study in the inferential analysis set had 93% power to reject the null hypothesis that the 
ORR was 40% given the ORR was 60%, with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.0237.  
The analysis sets have been revised after the first round of questions by the Applicant as follows, excluding 
centrally confirmed non-FL: 
FAS with 3 or more lines of prior therapy: n=75 
IAS with 3 or more lines of prior therapy: n=55 
SAS with 3 or more lines of prior therapy: n=73 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The study was a single arm, open-label trial and subjects and investigators were aware of treatment 
received. Data handling procedures for the study were to be devised to reduce potential sources of bias 
and maintain the validity and credibility of the study. These procedures were to be outlined in the study 
statistical analysis plan, DSMB charter, and trial integrity document. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were defined: 
• 
Inferential Analysis Set (IAS): all enrolled subjects (FL or MZL) treated with any dose of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel who met the eligibility criteria. This analysis set was to be used as 
primary efficacy analysis set. 
•  Full Analysis Set (FAS): all enrolled (leukapheresed) subjects; this set was to be used for 
sensitivity analyses. 
•  Safety Analysis Set: all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel; the safety 
analysis set was used for all safety analyses. 
•  Retreatment Analysis Set: all subjects who underwent retreatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel; 
this set was used for all retreatment safety and efficacy analyses. Subjects in the re-treatment 
analysis set were not included in any other analysis sets. 
EMA/622447/2022

Statistical Hypotheses 
Four hypotheses were tested using a fixed sequence procedure in terms of ORR and CR rate as 
determined by central review to control the overall type I error at 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 with the 
following testing order: 
•  Hypothesis 1 (H1): ORR as determined by central review less than 40% in subjects with FL in 
the IAS 
•  Hypothesis 2 (H2): CR rate as determined by central review less than 15% in subjects with FL in 
the IAS 
•  Hypothesis 3 (H3): test for ORR as determined by central review less than 40% in subjects with 
FL in the IAS who had had 3 or more lines of prior therapy 
•  Hypothesis 4 (H4): test for CR rate as determined by central review less than 15% in subjects 
with FL in the IAS who had had 3 or more lines of prior therapy  
Hypotheses H1 through H4 were to be assessed at the time of the interim analyses 3, 4, and 5 and at the 
time of the primary analysis. No formal hypothesis testing was planned for the MZL histological subtype. 
The analysis is descriptive only. 
Historical control ORR and CR rates 
The historical control rate for ORR was estimated based on results of limited available data on the 
approved therapies for r/r FL after 2 or more prior lines of therapy. These approved therapies at the time 
of trial design were the PI3K inhibitors idelalisib and copanlisib. In the trial of idelalisib, the ORR and CR 
rate for patients with relapsed FL after 2 or more prior lines of therapy were 54% and 8%, respectively, 
and in the trial of copanlisib, the ORR and CR rate for patients with r/r FL after 2 or more prior lines of 
therapy were 59% and 14%, respectively. It was anticipated that most subjects would have had prior 
treatment with at least one of the aforementioned PI3K inhibitors; thus, an ORR <40% or CR rate <15% 
would not be of clinical interest. Therefore, these rates were used for hypothesis testing. 
Analyses of primary and secondary endpoints 
The subject incidence of objective response and complete response together with 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals were to be calculated with the Clopper-Pearson method. An exact binomial test was to be used 
to compare the ORR and CR per central read among the subjects with FL and among the subjects with FL 
who have had 3 or more lines of prior therapy to the hypothesized historical control rates of 40% and 
15%, respectively.  
Kaplan-Meier plots, estimates, and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be generated for DOR, PFS 
and OS. Kaplan-Meier estimates were to be provided for the proportion of subjects who were alive and 
progression-free at 3-month time intervals. The number of subjects censored or having had events was 
to be summarized, as well as the reasons for censoring and the event type (PD or death; if applicable).  
The reverse Kaplan-Meier approach (Schemper and Smith 1996) was to be used to estimate the follow-up 
time for DOR.  
Planned analyses 
Five interim analyses were planned. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) was to be 
chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an analysis of risk versus benefit. The 5 
interim analyses were as follows: 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 34/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Interim analysis 1 was to be conducted after 10 subjects in the safety analysis set had been 
enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and had had an opportunity to be followed for 
4 weeks. This analysis was to be for safety only. 
Interim analysis 2 was to be conducted after 30 subjects in the safety analysis set had been 
enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and had had an opportunity to be followed for 
4 weeks. This analysis was to be for safety only. 
Interim analysis 3 was to be performed when 30 subjects in the FL inferential set had had the 
opportunity to be followed for 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. This interim 
analysis was to be for safety and to assess early demonstration of efficacy.  
Interim analysis 4 was to be performed when 80 subjects in the FL inferential analysis set had 
had the opportunity to be followed for 6 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  
Interim analysis 5 was to be performed when at least 80 subjects with FL in the inferential 
analysis set had had the opportunity to be followed for 9 months after the first disease response 
assessment.  
•  The primary analysis was to be performed when at least 80 subjects with FL in the inferential 
analysis set have had the opportunity to be followed for 12 months after the first disease 
response assessment. 
Additionally the following updated analyses were planned: 
•  Follow-up analysis 1 was planned to be performed when 80 subject in the FL inferential analysis 
set have had the opportunity to be followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
This analysis was to be for safety and efficacy and was to be descriptive. 
•  Follow-up analysis 2 was planned to be performed when 80 subjects in the FL inferential analysis 
set have had the opportunity to be followed for 24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
This analysis was to be for safety and efficacy and was to be descriptive. 
•  The final analysis was to occur after all subjects have completed the study. 
It should be noted that subjects with MZL were included in the fifth interim analysis and the primary 
analysis if they had had the opportunity to undergo the Week 4 disease assessment. 
An alpha spending function was to be used to allocate the alpha level between interim analyses 3, 4, and 
5, and the primary analysis. Using the O’Brien-Fleming boundary of the Lan-DeMets family of alpha 
spending functions, the nominal 1-sided alpha used to test for efficacy at interim analyses 3 was 
0.0003.With Protocol Amendment 5 the remaining alpha was split for interim analyses 4, 5 and primary 
analysis as 0.0005, 0.0005, and 0.0237.  
Multiplicity control over endpoints 
If the criteria for early efficacy were met for H1, the same alpha spending function was to be applied to 
test H2 at this interim analysis; otherwise, H2 through H4 was not be tested until the subsequent 
analysis. If the criteria for early efficacy were met for H1 and H2, the same alpha spending function was 
to be applied to test H3; otherwise, H3 and H4 were not to be tested until the subsequent analysis. If the 
criteria for early efficacy were met for H1, H2, and H3, the same alpha spending function was to be 
applied to test H4; otherwise, H4 was not be tested until the subsequent analysis. The study was not to 
be stopped if early efficacy was demonstrated.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 8. Participant flow 
Recruitment 
In total, 154 subjects with iNHL were assessed for eligibility. 
Among these 154 subjects, 127 subjects were diagnosed with FL according to local histopathological 
assessment. Although central confirmation of diagnosis was retrospective and was not required for 
treatment or continued enrolment on the study per protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP), the 
number of enrolled subjects with histologic confirmation of FL by central assessment was 101 subjects in 
the FAS. For the majority of the 26 subjects for which local diagnosis of FL could retrospectively not be 
confirmed per central assessment (“inconclusive”/”other”), this was due to the following: 1) the protocol 
did not mandate that the same tissue specimens had to be reviewed by local and central review 
pathologists, 2) the majority of the non-confirmed FL by central assessment were due to insufficient 
tissue, and 3) insufficient tumor in the samples provided. Only for 5 of the 26 subjects central lab 
assessment was highly suggestive of an alternative non-FL diagnosis (3 subjects with transformed FL, 1 
subject with small B-cell lymphoma, and 1 subject with MZL per central assessment). These 5 subjects 
were subsequently excluded from the FAS. 
Among  subjects  with  FL  (subjects  with  centrally  confirmed  non-FL  excluded),  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS) 
comprised 122 subjects. Of these subjects, 119 were included in the safety analysis set, 81 were included 
EMA/622447/2022

in  the  inferential  analysis  set,  75  were  included  in  the  subset  of  subjects  with  3  or  more  lines  of  prior 
therapy in the FAS. No additional subjects were enrolled/treated after the primary analysis data cutoff date. 
No manufacturing failures occurred. The median time from leukapheresis to the products release from the 
manufacturing  site  was  12.0  days  (range:  10  to  37  days).  Axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  delivered  to  the 
study site a median of 17.0 days (range: 13 to 72 days) after leukapheresis and was administered to the 
subject a median of 27.0 days (range: 19 to 330 days) after leukapheresis. Delays that occurred (> 50 
days) from manufacturing of the product to delivery to the clinical site or from leukapheresis to infusion of 
the product were due to the clinical course of the disease. 
Conduct of the study 
On June 2017, the first subject was screened in this study and the first subject was enrolled on 20 Jun 
2017. The data cutoff date for the primary analysis (12-month follow-up) was 12 March 2020. The data 
cut-off date of the 18-month follow-up analysis, also included in the submission, was 14 September 2020. 
The data cut-off date of the 24 month follow-up analysis, provided at the time of Day 120 responses and 
the data to be presented in the SmPC, is 31 March 2021. 
Study protocol amendments 
The original protocol, dated 26 November 2016, was amended 5 times before the data cutoff date of the 
primary analysis of the study. The amendments made related to iNHL in general and/or MZL/FL in particular.  
Study protocol deviations 
In the safety analysis set (SAS), important protocol deviations (IPDs) were reported for 23 subjects 
(19%) during the course of the trial. Most of IPDs were missing data (n=20; 16%).

a. Subjects with iNHL who progressed within 6 months of completion of the most recent prior treatment are defined as refractory. Subjects with 
iNHL who progressed > 6 months of completion of the most recent prior treatment are defined as relapsed. 
b. Time to relapse is defined as the time from initiation of the first line anti-CD20-chemotherapy combination therapy to progression. Number of 
subjects with time to relapse is based on those who had progressed with date of progression. Percentages are based on number of subjects who 
ever received anti-CD20-chemotherapy combination therapy. 
c. Disease burden, as defined by any of Groupe d Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria (subject meets the criteria for high tumor 
bulk versus subject does not meet the criteria for high tumor bulk): Involvement of ≥ 3 nodal sites, each with a diameter of ≥ 3 cm, Any nodal or e 
xtranodal tumor mass with a diameter of ≥ 7 cm, B symptoms, Splenomegaly, Pleural effusions or peritoneal ascites, Cytopenias, or Leukemia. 
d. Bone marrow assessment at baseline for lymphoma presence is based on investigator reported Lugano bone marrow assessment/ bone marrow 
assessment using aspirate or core biopsy at screening. If these are not available, lymphoma presence is based on diagnosis history of bone marrow 
involvement. 
e. Prior anti-CD20 single agent includes rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab. 
Retrospective Analysis of Tumor CD19 Status 
Among  122  subjects  with  FL  in  the  FAS  excluding  centrally  confirmed  non-FL,  113  subjects  were  with 
available samples at baseline; of these, 95 subjects had confirmed CD19+ antigen status, 8 subjects had 
confirmed CD19− status, and 10 subjects’ CD19 antigen status were missing/inconclusive at baseline. 
Outcomes and estimation  
Primary analysis (DCO 12 Mar 2020) 
Among the 84 subjects with FL (per investigator assessment) in the IAS who  had the opportunity to be 
followed for 12 months after the first disease response assessment, the ORR was 94% (79/84 subjects), 
with a 95% CI of (87%, 98%). This ORR was significantly greater (p < 0.0001; less than the alpha level of 
0.0237 allocated at the primary analysis) than the prespecified historical control rate of 40%. Therefore, 
the null hypothesis was rejected and the primary efficacy endpoint for ZUMA-5 was met (Hypothesis 1). 
The CR rate was 80% (67/84 subjects, 95% CI: 70%, 88%), which was significantly greater (p < 0.0001) 
than the prespecified control rate of 15%. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected and the criteria for 
the key secondary endpoint of CR rate was met (Hypothesis 2). 
Among  the  58  subjects  with  FL  who  had  3  or  more  lines  of  prior  therapy,  the  ORR  was  95%  (55  of  58 
subjects, 95% CI: 86%, 99%), with a CR rate of 81% (47 of 58 subjects, 95% CI: 69%, 90%). The ORR 
of 95% was significantly greater (p < 0.0001) than the prespecified control rate of 40%; therefore, the 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 41/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
criteria for efficacy for the secondary endpoint of ORR in subjects who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy 
was met (Hypothesis 3). 
The CR rate among subjects with FL who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy was tested because the ORR 
among these subjects was significant. The CR rate of 81% was significantly greater (p < 0.0001) than the 
prespecified control rate of 15%; therefore, the criteria for efficacy for the secondary endpoint of CR rate 
in subjects who had 3 or more lines of prior therapy was met (Hypothesis 4). 
24 month FU analysis (DCO 31 Mar 2021) 
Based on the 24-month data cutoff date, the ORR and CR rate of subjects with FL who received 3 or more 
lines of therapy in the FAS and IAS excluding centrally confirmed non-FL were similar (ORR: 91% versus 
95% respectively; CR rate: 77% versus 78%, respectively). Among the subjects with FL who received 3 or 
more lines of therapy in the FAS excluding centrally confirmed non-FL and who achieved a CR or PR, the 
median time to first objective response was 0.99 month (range: 0.8 to 3.1 months). Among the 58 subjects 
who achieved a CR, the median time to first CR was 1.05 month (range: 0.8 to 12.1 months). Twenty nine 
out of 75 FL patients who had 3 or more prior lines of therapy initially achieved a PR, 19 of whom later 
achieved CR. The KM median estimates of DOR, PFS, OS, and TTNT in the FAS and IAS were similar (DOR: 
38.6 months in each analysis set; PFS: 40.2 versus 28.0 months, respectively; OS: not estimable in each 
analysis set; TTNT: 40.2 versus 39.6 months, respectively). The pattern of the KM PFS plots in the FAS and 
IAS are parallel. Median follow-up time for DOR was 22.6 months (95% CI: 18.8, 23.0 months).

Ancillary analyses (based on 24 months analysis; CDO 31 MAR 2021) 
Sensitivity analyses for DOR and PFS according to EMA censoring rules (FAS with FL subjects 
who received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy, excluding centrally confirmed non-FL)  
In the primary analysis for DOR based on the 24-months data cut-off date, 3 subjects were censored due 
to starting new anticancer therapy and 1 subject due to retreatment. In the primary analysis for PFS, 4 
subjects were censored due to starting new anticancer therapy and 2 subjects due to retreatment. These 
subjects started new anticancer therapy or retreatment in the absence of prior documented progression 
confirmed by central assessment, however the decision to start another treatment or to retreat was based 
on the investigator’s assessment reporting disease progression. All subjects who received subsequent HSCT 
had disease progression reported by both central and investigator’s assessment. Upon request, sensitivity 
analyses for DOR and PFS in the FL FAS excluding centrally confirmed non-FL who received ≥ 3 prior lines 
of therapy, considering the start of other new anticancer therapies or axi-cel retreatment in the absence of 
prior documented progression as an event (EMA censoring rules), were provided.

ORR in subjects with 3 or more prior lines of therapy is 
defined as the incidence of a CR or a PR by the Lugano 
Classification {Cheson 2014} as determined by central 
assessment for those subjects who had 3 or more lines of 
prior therapy.  
CR rate in subjects with 3 or more prior lines of therapy is 
defined as the incidence of CR as best response to treatment 
by the Lugano Classification {Cheson 2014} as determined 
by central assessment for those subjects who had 3 or more 
lines of prior therapy. 
DOR was defined as the time from first objective response 
(CR or PR) to disease progression or death. Subjects not 
meeting the criteria by the analysis data cutoff date were 
censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date 
prior to the data cutoff date or new anticancer therapy start 
date (including SCT or retreatment of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel), whichever was earlier 
PFS was defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion date (analyses based on the IAS and the safety 
analysis set) or the enrollment/leukapheresis date (analysis 
based on the FAS) to the date of disease progression per 
{Cheson 2014} or death due to any cause. The main 
analysis of PFS was based on progression defined per central 
assessment. PFS for subjects who received any subsequent 
anticancer therapy (including SCT or retreatment with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel) in the absence of prior documented 
progression was censored at the date of the last evaluable 
disease assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy 
or the last evaluable disease assessment prior to SCT. 
OS was defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion for the analyses based on the IAS and the safety 
analysis set or the enrollment/leukapheresis date for the 
analysis based on the FAS to the date of death due to any 
cause.  
TTNT is defined as the time from the leukapheresis date (for 
FAS) or the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date (for IAS 
and safety analysis set) to the start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy or death from any cause. Subjects who had not 
received subsequent anticancer therapy, or were still alive 
by the data cutoff date, or had died after the data cutoff 
date were to be censored at their last new therapy status 
date prior to the data cutoff 
date. Subjects who were alive after the data cutoff date were 
to be censored at the data cutoff date.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Initially,  the  ZUMA-5  trial was  designed  as  a  single-arm  open-label  phase 2 multicenter trial  in  subjects 
with r/r iNHL, and initially patients with biopsy proven progression of r/r follicular lymphoma Grade 1, Grade 
2 or Grade 3a have been enrolled. Between the original trial protocol, dated 26 November 2016 and the 
current  valid  version  of  amendment  5,  dated  24  July  2019,  a  couple  of  important  changes  have  been 
introduced,  including  the  addition  of  patients  with  r/r  marginal  zone  lymphoma.  According  to  the  final 
protocol, the two cohorts (FL and MZL) were analysed together with very different follow up criteria. The 
minimum follow-up for MZL patients for the primary analysis was 4 weeks, while the minimum follow-up 
for FL patients was 12 months. As the sought indication is only for FL pooling of MZL and FL patients is not 
considered sensible.  
The trial was a single-arm open-label trial, and therefore sensitive to selection bias and assessment bias. 
A DSMB was tasked with the interim review of data. The Applicant further planned to protect the conduct 
of study via limited access of company members to the data of the ongoing trial which was defined in a 
“Trial Integrity Document”. However, the document showed that many subjects had broad access to raw 
and aggregated data at all times. No firewall was in place. Functions such as biostatisticians were granted 
full  access  to  the  data  at  any  time  and  were  involved  in  drafting  protocol  amendments  which  included 
substantial  changes  to  the  confirmatory  analyses  (including  changes  in  endpoints,  analysis  populations, 
number and timing of interim analyses and type 1 error control over interim analyses). Interim analyses 4 
and 5 were furthermore defined only after the successful interim analysis 3 was conducted. This shows that 
the  conduct  of  trial  was  not  to  the  usual  standards  for  a  well  conducted  confirmatory  trial,  but  is  not 
expected to have a major negative impact on general data integrity.  
The high number of relevant changes and adaptations of the study protocol (6 protocol amendments) and 
the SAP during the conduct of the trial is noticeable, and may result from the clinical trial initially not having 
been planned as a pivotal and/or supportive clinical trial for the indication extension on r/r FL. However, no 
major  impact  on  the  data  is  estimated.  The  change  to  add  prior  therapy  with  an  anti-CD20  monoclonal 
antibody combined with an alkylating agent as inclusion criterion, e.g., was required in order to ensure that 
subjects have received standard first line therapy prior to enrollment. 
As requested, the Applicant provided data on clinical efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the indication of 
r/r FL after 3 or more prior lines of therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL and for a 
recent  data  cutoff  date  (24-month  follow-up  analysis  data  cutoff  date:  31 March 2021).  The  originally 
reported results for ORR, CR and duration of response in subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel after 
3L+ therapy remain compelling, although uncertainties related to a single arm trial may be raised. Most of 
the included patients had not received prior HDT and autologous ASCT. Due to the safety and the logistic 
issues of CAR-T therapy, this treatment should be reserved to FL grade 1-3a patients following at least 3-
4 prior therapies, including HDT. Patients with FL Grade 3B have been excluded from the pivotal trial, while 
the  proposed  target  indication  in  r/r  FL  actually  includes  all  grade  FL,  including  FL  Grade  3B.  The 
extrapolation to patients with FL Grade 3B is considered permissible, as in clinical practice FL Grade 3B is 
often treated as DLBCL, for which axi-cel is also indicated. 
A relatively large proportion of subjects (n=23; 19%) reported an important protocol deviation (IPD), from 
which  only  a  minority  [n  =  3;2  %)]  could  be  explained  as  related  to  the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.  Most  of  the  IPDs  related  to  missing  data  were  missed  FU-antibody  samples,  missed  two 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 55/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
consecutive  exams  and  missed  post  treatment  PET-CT  and/or  diagnostic  CTs.  Moreover,  there  were 
important  differences  in  number  and  nature  of  protocol  deviations  between  study  sites,  requiring  the 
Applicant’s remote observation of one site, were n=111 PDs occurred in 7 subjects included. However, no 
major risks were identified and it was concluded that these IPD may not had a negative impact on general 
data integrity.  
Bridging therapy between leukapheresis and LDC based on investigator decision was not excluded according 
to the ZUMA-5 clinical trial protocol and 4 subjects with FL excluding centrally confirmed non-FL received 
bridging therapy. For subjects who received bridging chemotherapy, PET-CT scan was to be performed to 
establish a new baseline before the start of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which ensured that bridging 
chemotherapy did not impact the analysis of the disease response.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses (based on 24-month DCO) 
ZUMA-5 
The full analysis set (FAS) of subjects with FL excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL and who 
received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, which is the claimed target indication of this MAA, comprised 75 subjects. 
The majority of subjects presented with disease stage Grade III (n=34; 45%) and Grade IV (n=31; 41%), 
and with intermediate (FLIPI total score of 2) (n=30; 40%) and high risk (FLIPI total score of 3-5) (n=34; 
45%)  disease.  The  retrospective  CD19  status  for  n=69/75  evaluable  subjects  per  central  assessment 
revealed  that  56  subjects  of  these  69  (90.3%)  were  confirmed  CD19  positive,  6 subjects  were  CD19 
negative, and 7 subjects’ CD19 antigen status were missing/inconclusive at baseline. The median number 
of  prior  therapy  lines  was  4  (range:  3  to  10),  and  45  subjects  (60%)  had  received  4  or  more  lines  of 
therapy.  Twenty  two  subjects  (29%)  had  previously  received  auto-SCT  and  30  subjects  (40%)  had 
previously  been  treated  with  a  PI3K  inhibitor. With 91%  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  high-risk  prognostic 
factor (progression within 24 months from the first anti-CD20-chemotherapy combination therapy, within 
6 months after the last line of prior therapy, or after auto-SCT), overall this population can been considered 
at high risk with a medical need for alternative treatment options. 
Response  rates  at  24  months  follow-up  in  the  FAS  for  subjects  with  FL  who  received  ≥  3  lines  of  prior 
therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL (n = 75): the primary and secondary endpoints 
ORR and CR were 91% (68 of 75 subjects, 95% CI: 82%, 96%) and 77% (58 of 75 subjects, 95% CI: 
66%, 86%).  
With regard to DOR the KM-median was 38.6 months (95% CI: 24.7, NE) in the FAS for subjects with FL 
who received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL. The subjects 
with FL had a median follow-up time for DOR of 22.6 months (95% CI: 18.8, 23.0 months). Among the 75 
subjects  with  FL  who  received  ≥  3  lines  of  prior  therapy,  KM  estimates  of  PFS  rates  at  24  months  was 
71.8% (95% CI: 58.6%, 81.4%). The KM median for PFS was 40.2 months (95% CI: 26.6, NE). The KM 
median for OS was not reached (95% CI: 40.2 months, NE), with a median follow-up time of 29.7 months 
(95% CI: 26.9, 31.87 months). Estimates of OS at 24 months was 85.5% (95% CI: 74.6, 91.9%). 
With regard to analyses for DOR and PFS, patients who received other anticancer therapies (including HSCT 
and axi-cel retreatment) were censored. As this kind of analysis might be prone to informative censoring, 
upon request, sensitivity analyses for DOR and PFS in the FL FAS excluding centrally confirmed non-FL who 
received  ≥  3  prior  lines  of  therapy,  considering  the  start  of  other  new  anticancer  therapies  or  axi-cel 
retreatment  in  the  absence  of  prior  documented  progression  as  an  event  (EMA  censoring  rules),  were 
provided.  Although  a  larger  difference  in  median  PFS  has  been  noted  between  primary  and  sensitivity 
analysis (40.2 months and 28.9 months, respectively), outcomes for DOR were very similar (both median 
and K-M plots) and K-M curves for PFS also followed a similar pattern. In conclusion, censoring patients 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 56/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
who started a new anticancer therapies or were retreated with axi-cel retreatment in the absence of prior 
documented progression as reported by central assessment on DOR and PFS outcomes, is not considered 
impactful for the interpretation of data. Median follow-up time for TTNT was 29.3 months (95% CI: 25.7, 
33.6 months). The KM median TTNT  was 40.2 months (95% CI: 26.6, NE). The longest TTNT was 43.3 
months as of the data cutoff date. The KM estimates of the proportion of subjects who had not commenced 
subsequent therapy at Months 24 was 67.0% (95% CI: 54.8%, 76.6%). 
Although the number of subjects with CD19 negative status at baseline is small, and thus results should be 
interpreted with caution, efficacy outcomes (CR rate, ORR and DOR) and PK in patients with baseline CD19- 
status seemed to be at least non-inferior compared to the efficacy outcomes and PK in patients with CD19+ 
status.  In  addition,  although  the data  on  confirmed CD19  antigen  status  at  relapse  are  few,  there is  no 
evidence of CD19− escape. 
Only n=8/75 subjects (11%) in FAS with FL excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL and who 
received  ≥  3  lines  of  prior  therapy  were  non-US  subjects  (in  particular  from  France),  which  might 
compromise  the  external  validity  of  the  ZUMA-5  study.  A  significant  difference  observed  is  the  higher 
number of prior auto-SCT (65%/EU versus 25%/US). However, response (CR rate) and safety profile seem 
consistent between subjects from EU and US. 
The results provided for the requested revised analysis sets, and for the 24-month data cut-off date indicate 
that the ORR and CR rate of subjects with FL who received 3 or more lines of therapy in the FAS and IAS 
excluding  centrally  confirmed  non-FL  were  similar  (ORR:  91%  versus  95%  respectively;  CR  rate:  77% 
versus 78%, respectively). The KM median estimates of DOR, PFS, OS, and TTNT in the FAS and IAS were 
similar  (DOR:  38.6 months  in  each  analysis  set;  PFS:  40.2 versus  28.0 months,  respectively;  OS:  not 
estimable in each analysis set; TTNT: 40.2 versus 39.6 months, respectively).  
SCHOLAR-5 
SCHOLAR-5 as a synthetic supportive trial can be acknowledged in general. In a comparative analysis ORR 
and CR in SCHOLAR-5 was lower than in ZUMA-5. The statistical challenges such as potential bias (due to 
different sources) which are inherent to single-arm trials with external controls make further conclusions 
from this data impossible. OS and PFS from single-arm trials should not be compared with external controls 
due to an unknown magnitude of bias. The data from SCHOLAR-5 overall is considered overall supportive. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The data presented on primary and secondary endpoints in subjects with r/r FL, the target indication in the 
ZUMA-5 trial, indicate a benefit for the patients. The trial was a single-arm open label trial without a good 
firewall  in  place  to  protect  decision  making  to  be  influenced  by  the  available  data.  Decisions  to  include 
further interim analyses (IA4 and 5)  were even made post hoc after the results from interim analysis 3 
were  known.  Given  that  the  first  efficacy  interim  analysis  (IA3)  was  significant  and  given  the  very  high 
effects both for ORR as well as CRR at all analyses this is not considered of major relevance for the overall 
extension of indication procedure. The trial is considered to have met the primary objective at IA3, which 
is then numerically supported by analyses with more subjects and longer follow up. The conduct of trial 
was not up to the usual standards, however, this is not expected to have a negative impact on general data 
integrity.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The important identified risks and the potential risks identified for axicabtagene ciloleucel are similar to the 
AEs identified for this product class. No further risks and AEs could be identified which would be specific for 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  or  for  the  indications  to  be  treated  with  axicabtagene  ciloleucel.  The  important 
identified risks are CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. 
A new indication is being sought for the treatment of adult patients with r/r FL after three or more lines of 
systemic therapy with this submission. The evaluation of safety is based on the ZUMA-5 study. The initial 
analysis cutoff date is March 12, 2020, which represents the 12 months follow-up data. Additional safety 
data were from the follow-up analysis 1, with a data cutoff date of 14 September 2020, (hereafter referred 
to as the 18-month analysis) of ZUMA-5. This prespecified analysis was performed when at least 80 subjects 
with FL had had the opportunity to be followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  
Supporting  safety  data  are  also  presented  from  3  studies  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  subjects  with 
aggressive  large  B-cell  lymphomas:  KTE-C19-101  (ZUMA-1),  KTE-C19-109  (ZUMA-9),  and  KTE-C19-112 
(ZUMA-12). The additional safety data are provided with a data cutoff date of 11 August 2020. 
Patient exposure 
Throughout the documents, the Applicant presented data for patients with FL, but also for patients with 
Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), sometimes combining these patients in an indolent NHL group. For the 
primary safety evaluation in this AR, the data obtained in FL patients were considered as main data (18-
month follow-up, data cutoff 14 September 2020), and data from MZL patients were considered supportive.  
The safety analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel.

In total, as of the 18-month follow-up (cutoff 14 September 2020), 153 subjects with iNHL were enrolled 
(ie, underwent leukapheresis): 127 subjects with FL, 25 subjects with MZL, and 1 subject with DLBCL. 
The  DLBCL  was  discovered  via  a  pretreatment  biopsy  that  was  examined  after  the  subject  enrolled; 
EMA/622447/2022

consequently, the subject was deemed ineligible and was withdrawn from the study. A total of 148 subjects 
(124  subjects  with  FL  and  24  subjects  with  MZL)  had  received  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  and 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel;  5  subjects  had  not  received  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  or  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. One of these 5 subjects was the aforementioned subject with DLBCL who was deemed ineligible; 
the  reasons  for  not  receiving  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  or  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  for  the  other  4 
subjects were as follows:  
-  One  subject  with  FL  died  due to  cardiac  arrest  before  having  the  opportunity  to  be  treated on 
study. 
-  One  subject  with  FL  was  found  to  be  ineligible  after  enrollment  but  prior  to  treatment  due  to 
inadequate platelet levels (< 75,000 per mm3); this subject was treated under a compassionate 
use protocol and was not included in the safety analysis set. 
-  One  subject  with  FL  was  leukapheresed,  but  experienced  a  CR  prior  to  lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy and had partially withdrawn at the time of data cutoff; the subject remains in follow-
up. 
-  One  subject  with  MZL  was  leukapheresed,  but  experienced  a  CR  prior  to  lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy  and  was  considered  ineligible  to  receive  infusion  based  on  inclusion  criteria;  the 
subject remains in follow-up. 
Six  subjects  with  FL  received  bridging  therapy  between  enrollment  and  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy. 
New baseline scans were obtained after bridging treatment and before lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
Thirteen subjects (11 subjects with FL and 2 subjects with MZL) were retreated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
These subjects are included in the retreatment analysis set. The outcome of retreatment for these subjects 
is not part of the main inferential analysis and is analysed separately. (For the retreated patients the safety 
profile was similar to that observed for the main analysis.) 
As  of  the  data  cutoff  date,  18  subjects  (14  subjects  with  FL  and  4  subjects  with  MZL)  who  received 
axicabtagene ciloleucel had died. One additional subject with FL who received axicabtagene ciloleucel was 
removed from the study due to investigator decision and ultimately died. 
For the 124 subjects with FL who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, the median actual study follow-up time 
was 20.34 months (range: 0.3 to 37.7 months); 91 of 127 subjects (73%) had a potential study follow-up 
time of at least 18 months.

Exposure to LD 
All  subjects  in  the  ZUMA-5  safety  analysis  set  received  the  planned  total  BSA-adjusted  dose  of 
cyclophosphamide (1500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (90 mg/m2). 
Exposure to Axicabtagene Ciloleucel 
Among subjects with FL, the median weight-adjusted dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel was 2.0 x 106 anti-
CD19 CAR T cells/kg (range: 1.3 x 106 to 2.1 x 106 cells/kg). The median total number of anti-CD19 CAR 
T  cells  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion  was  170.0  x  106  cells  (range:  100.0  x  106  to  200.0  x  106 
cells), and the median total number of T cells infused was 283.70 x 106 cells (range: 123.5 x 106 to 769.2 
x 106 cells). The majority of subjects (120 subjects, 97%) received within 10% of the planned total dose. 
The median duration for hospitalization after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion was 13.0 days (range: 
8.0 to 40 days) for subjects with FL. The median duration in the intensive care unit was 6 days for subjects 
with FL (range: 2 to 24 days).  
Adverse events  
The overall summary of AEs at the 18 months cutoff is displayed in Table 19.  
As of the data cutoff date, 3 subjects with FL (2%) who received axicabtagene ciloleucel had died due to 
AEs:  
- 1 subject died due multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on Day 7 that was secondary to CRS (the 
death was deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel),  
- 1 subject died due to cardiopulmonary arrest that followed an aortic dissection on Day 399 (the 
death was deemed unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel),  
- 1 subject died due to disease progression on Day 47 that was categorized as an AE (Grade 5 B-
cell lymphoma) because it occurred within the 3-month AE reporting window. 
Overall,  safety  results  were  generally  similar  in  the  subset  of  subjects  who  had  3 or  more  lines  of  prior 
therapy  (99%  subjects  with  TEAE,  47%  with  SAEs,  79%  with  CRS,  and  55%  with  neurologic  events) 
compared with those found for the larger safety analysis set in subjects with 2 or more lines of prior therapy.

Among  subjects  with  FL,  the  most  common  AEs  by  preferred  terms  were  pyrexia  (103  subjects,  83%), 
hypotension  (59  subjects,  48%),  and  headache  (55  subjects,  44%).  The  most  common  AEs  (>60%  of 
subjects) by SOC were general disorders and administration site conditions (113 subjects, 91%), nervous 
system disorders (90 subjects, 73%), and gastrointestinal disorders (88 subjects, 71%). 
Twenty-nine  subjects  (23%)  had  worst  Grade  3  AEs,  73  subjects  (59%)  had  worst  Grade  4  AEs,  and  3 
subjects (2%) had worst Grade 5 AEs. The most common worst Grade 3 or higher AEs were neutropenia 
(44 subjects, 35%), and neutrophil count decreased and anemia (29 subjects each, 23%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
Among subjects with FL, 57 subjects (46%) had at least 1 SAE, the most frequently reported of which were 
pyrexia  (16  subjects,  13%),  encephalopathy  (8  subjects,  6%),  pneumonia  (8  subjects,  6%),  and 
confusional state (7 subjects, 6%). The most common worst Grade 3 or higher SAEs were encephalopathy 
(8 subjects, 6%), pneumonia (7 subjects, 6%), and confusional state (4 subjects, 3%).

Deaths 
Among all subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, 15 FL subjects had died as of the data cutoff 
date (14 September 2020), including 2 which occurred within 3 months of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion, and 13 occurred > 3 months after the infusion): 
- 
Nine subjects from progressive disease (including one subject with ≥3 lines of prior therapy who 
died due to PD on Day 47 that was reported as Grade 5 B-cell lymphoma because it occurred within the 
AE reporting window) 
- 
Two subjects from AE (both in subjects with ≥3 lines of prior therapy): One subject died on Day 7 
due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that was secondary to CRS, both of which were attributed to 
the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. One subject died on Day 399 due to cardiopulmonary arrest that 
followed an aortic dissection; the subject remained in CR at Month 12 (the last visit before her death) per 
central assessment. The death was deemed unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
- 
One from secondary malignancy: This subject died on Day 337 due to acute myeloid leukemia 
(not attributable to axicabtagene ciloleucel) after having partially withdrawn consent from the study and 
having agreed to be followed for survival.  
- 
One from infection (who died after partial withdrawal of consent) (in subject with ≥3 lines of prior 
therapy): The subject died on Day 715 due to an infection (coccidioidomycosis) that was not attributable 
to axicabtagene ciloleucel. The subject was in CR at Month 18 (the last visit before his death) per central 
assessment. 
- 
Two from unknown causes: One subject died due to unknown reasons on Day 692; this subject 
had been removed from the study by the investigator. The investigator discovered the death in public 
records without any details. One additional subject died due to unknown reasons on Day 697.

AEs of Special Interest 
Important identified risks 
1. CRS 
CRS was graded as a syndrome according to a modification of the criteria established by Lee and Colleagues. 
All cases of CRS were considered related to axicabtagene ciloleucel.

The median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1 to 15 days) for subjects with FL. As of the data cutoff date, 
CRS had resolved in all but 1 subject in ZUMA-5; the subject with unresolved CRS had FL and died on Day 
7  due  to  multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome  that  was  secondary  to  CRS.  For  the  96  subjects  with  FL 
whose CRS had resolved, the median duration of CRS was 6 days (range: 1 to 27 days).

For subjects with FL, the median time to event onset was 7 days (range: 1 to 177 days). Six subjects with 
FL had neurologic events with an onset > 80 days after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion; these events 
were as follows: 
-  One  subject  had  worst  Grade  1  disturbance  in  attention  (which  started  on  Day  94  and  was 
unresolved  as  of  the  data  cutoff  date)  and  somnolence  (Day  200  through  Day  219).  Only  the 
disturbance in attention was deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
-  One subject had a worst Grade 1 tremor (Day 94 through Day 262) that was deemed related to 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 71/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
-  One subject had worst Grade 1 aphasia (Day 97 through Day 193) that was deemed unrelated to 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
-  One subject had worst Grade 2 events of amnesia (Day 119 through Day 137) and confusional state 
(Day 124 through Day 133), neither of which were deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
-  One subject had a worst Grade 1 memory impairment (Day 176 through Day 267) that was deemed 
unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
-  One  subject  had  a  worst  Grade  1  hypoaesthesia  (Day  452  through  Day  456)  that  was  deemed 
unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
As of the data cutoff date Sept 2020, three subjects had unresolved neurologic events at the data cutoff: 
memory impairment [started on Day 59], paresthesia [started on Day 66], and the aforementioned subject 
with disturbance in attention [started on Day 94]; all Grade 1. These events were all assessed as nonserious 
and deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. One additional subject with FL had disturbance in attention 
that was deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel (started on Day 94; Grade 1). The subject died due to 
an unknown cause on Day 692, and the event was recorded to be resolved on the same day. 
Among 70 subjects with FL who had neurologic events, 67 subjects (96%) had events that resolved; the 
events  resolved  within  3  weeks  after  the  infusion  for  41  subjects  (59%)  and  within  8  weeks  after  the 
infusion for 54 subjects (77%). Among the 67 subjects with FL whose neurologic events had resolved, the 
median duration of neurologic events was 14.0 days (range: 1 to 452 days). Three subjects with FL had 
neurologic events that were present beyond study Day 200 as follows: 
- 
Two subjects had Grade 1 tremor from Day 94 to Day 262 and Day 19 to Day 369, respectively 
(both events were deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel). 
-  One subject had Grade 1 hypoesthesia from Day 452 to Day 456 that was deemed unrelated to 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
There were 11 subjects with FL who had neurologic events that occurred > 30 days but < 200 days after 
the axicabtgene ciloleucel infusion. All of these neurologic events were Grade 1 except for the events of 
Grade 2 amnesia and Grade 2 confusional state in 1 FL subject. 
3. Cytopenias 
Among  subjects  with  FL,  91  subjects  (73%)  had  any  cytopenia  AEs,  and  86  subjects  (69%)  had  worst 
Grade 3 or higher cytopenia AEs. 79 subjects (64%) had neutropenia AEs of any grade, and 75 subjects 
(60%) had worst Grade 3 or higher neutropenia AEs. Forty-four subjects (35%) had thrombocytopenia AEs 
of  any  grade,  and  29  subjects  (23%)  had  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  thrombocytopenia  AEs.  Forty-four 
subjects (35%) had anemia AEs of any grade, and 29 subjects (23%) had worst Grade 3 or higher anemia 
AEs. 
The number of subjects with FL who had worst Grade 3 or higher prolonged neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
and anemia AEs (that were present on or after Day 30 following the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 
0)  were  34  subjects  (27%),  13  subjects  (10%),  and  8  subjects  (6%),  respectively.  The  duration  of 
cytopenias  was  calculated  for  subjects  whose  events  had  resolved.  The  mean  (standard  deviation)  and 
median (range) times to onset of cytopenias were 16.7 (51.7) and 3.0 (1 to 325) days after axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion, respectively. The median duration of cytopenias were 27.0 (range: 1 to 769) days.

4. Infections 
Among subjects with FL, 64 subjects (52%) had infections; 18 subjects (15%) had worst Grade 3 infections 
and  1  subject  (1%)  had  worst  Grade  4  infection.  No  subject  had  a  worst  Grade  5  infection.  The  most 
common  events  by  preferred  terms  within  the  SOC  of  infections  and  infestations  were  pneumonia  (15 
subjects, 12%), upper respiratory tract infection (14 subjects, 11%), and oral candidiasis, sinusitis, and 
urinary tract infection (9 subjects, 7%). The most common bacterial infections were staphylococcal infection 
(3 subjects, 2%) and clostridium difficile colitis and hemophilus infection (2 subjects each, 2%); all other 
bacterial infections were reported for 1 subject each (1%). The most common viral infections were influenza 
(6 subjects, 5%), rhinovirus infection (4 subjects, 3%), and herpes zoster (3 subjects, 2%); all other viral 
infections  were  reported  for  1  subject  each  (1%).  Opportunistic  infections  included  cytomegalovirus 
viraemia, mycobacterium kansasii infection, ophthalmic herpes simplex, and systemic candida, all reported 
in 1 subject each (1%). The most common other types of infections were pneumonia (15 subjects, 12%), 
upper respiratory tract infections (14 subjects, 11%), and sinusitis and urinary tract infections (9 subjects 
each, 7%). Worst Grade 3 events included pneumonia (7 subjects, 6%), urinary tract infection (3 subjects, 
2%),  and  staphylococcal  infection,  clostridium  difficile  colitis,  bacterial  infection,  Escherichia  infection, 
pneumonia streptococcal, systemic candida, herpes zoster, sinusitis, vascular device infection, bacteremia, 
kidney infection, prostate infection, and viremia (1 subject each, 1%). The single worst Grade 4 event was 
sepsis (1 subject, 1%). 
5. Hypogammaglobulinemia 
Among subjects with FL, 24 subjects (19%) had AEs of hypogammaglobulinemia (17% in of subjects who 
had 3 or more lines of prior therapy), and the majority were either worst Grade 1 (7 subjects, 6%) or worst 
Grade 2 (16 subjects, 13%). One subject (1%) had a worst Grade 3 event. 
Important potential risks 
Secondary Malignancies 
All other new malignancies were assessed as being unrelated to axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
In the FL patients, there were 9 secondary malignancies identified: squamous cell carcinoma (2 subjects), 
malignant anorectal neoplasm and secondary anal/rectal cancer (1 subject), and myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS), malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, acute bilineal leukemia, and prostate cancer (1 subject 
each).  In  addition,  there  was  1  subject  whose  death  was  flagged  as  due  to  secondary  malignancy;  this 
subject died due to acute myeloid leukemia after having partially withdrawn consent from the study and 
having  agreed to be  followed  for  survival.  The  events  of  acute  bilineal  leukemia  and  MDS  were  deemed 
related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
Immunogenicity 
Subjects were tested for immunogenicity. In the FL patients, based on an initial screening assay, 14 subjects 
were antibody-positive at baseline and 14 of the 123 tested subjects (11%) had a positive antibody test 
result at any time point. Samples from all 14 subjects were sent for confirmatory testing via a cell-based 
assay. Results of the confirmatory assay indicated that all 14 subjects were antibody-negative at all time 
points tested.

RCR 
No patient tested positive for RCR. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
No cases of tumor lysis syndrome were reported. 
Aggravation of GVHD 
No subject had an aggravation of GVHD that was attributable to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Arrhythmia 
There were 52% FL patients with cardiac arrhythmia AEs (mainly grade 1 or 2). The most common events 
were  sinus tachycardia  (33%)  and  tachycardia  (12%).  There  were  2%  of  subjects  who presented  worst 
Grade  3  cardiac  arrhythmias  (atrial  fibrillation  in  1  subject  and  sinus  tachycardia  in  2  subjects:  all  
considered related to axicabtagene ciloleucel, not serious). All cardiac arrhythmia events resolved. 
Laboratory findings 
Among subjects with FL, the most common increased laboratory values were creatinine (79 subjects, 64%), 
glucose  (78  subjects,  63%),  and  ALT  (68  subjects,  55%).  The  most  common  worst  Grade  3  or  higher 
increased  laboratory  values  were  glucose  and urate (11  subjects  each,  9%),  ALT  (7  subjects,  6%),  and 
aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  bilirubin  (5  subjects  each,  4%).  The  most  common  decreased 
laboratory values were leukocytes (122 subjects, 98%), neutrophils (121 subjects, 98%), and hemoglobin 
(103  subjects,  83%).  The  most  common  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  decreased  laboratory  values  were 
leukocytes (116 subjects, 94%), neutrophils (114 subjects, 92%), and platelets (43 subjects, 35%).

Safety in special populations 
1. AEs by Age 
Among subjects with FL, compared with subjects who were < 65 years old, subjects who were ≥ 65 years 
old showed a trend toward a higher incidence of SAEs (42% vs 55%), axicabtagene ciloleucel-related SAEs 
(27% vs 39%), neurologic events (49% vs 74%), and serious neurologic events (10% vs 26%). In general, 
subjects ≥ 65 years old had a higher incidence of worst Grade 3 or higher events. 
2. AEs by Sex 
Among  subjects  with  FL,  compared  with  males,  females  showed  a  trend  toward  a  higher  incidence  of 
hypogammaglobulinemia (14% vs 27%), worst Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related AEs (52% 
vs 65%), infections (47% vs 59%), and worst Grade 3 or higher infections (10% vs 24%). Across all other 
categories, the incidence of worst Grade 3 or higher events was similar. 
3. AEs by R/R Subgroup 
Among subjects with FL, compared with subjects who had relapsed, subjects with refractory disease showed 
a trend toward a higher incidence of axicabtagene ciloleucel-related SAEs (23% vs 35%) and serious CRS 
(5% vs 15%). Across all other categories, the incidence of worst Grade 3 or higher events was similar. 
4. AEs by Double Refractory Subgroup 
Among subjects with FL, compared with subjects who were not in the double refractory subgroup, subjects 
in  the  double  refractory  subgroup  showed  a  trend  towards  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  (42%  vs  56%), 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel-related  SAEs  (24%  vs  47%),  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  axicabtagene  ciloleucel-
related SAEs (18% vs 28%), and serious neurologic events (11% vs 25%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
N/A. 
Post marketing experience 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel was first approved in the US on 18 October 2017 and is currently approved under 
the trade name YESCARTA® in 36 countries including the US, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Israel, and 
the European Economic Area (31 countries). 
Postmarketing data are provided in a periodic safety update report/ periodic benefit-risk evaluation report 
(PBRER) for axicabtagene ciloleucel that covers the 6-month period from 18 April 2020 to 17 October 2020 
and summarized here. 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 75/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
As of 17 October 2020, 789 subjects have been exposed to axicabtagene ciloleucel in company sponsored 
interventional clinical trials. During the reporting period (18 April 2020 to 17 October 2020) approximately 
43  subjects  were  administered  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  company  sponsored  clinical  trials.  In  the 
postmarketing setting, cumulative exposure to axicabtagene ciloleucel was approximately 3666 patients as 
of  17  October  2020.  During  the  reporting  period,  approximately  858  patients  were  administered 
axicabtagene ciloleucel in the postmarketing setting. 
During the reporting period 18 April 2020 to 17 October 2020, the axicabtagene ciloleucel company core 
data sheet was updated twice. The first update, on 13 May 2020, included opportunistic infection data that 
further characterizes the known axicabtagene ciloleucel risk Infections. In addition, the CRS and neurologic 
toxicity grading and management guidances were revised and the 9-month interim data from ZUMA-5 were 
added. The second update, on 24 July 2020, included the 12-month primary analysis data from ZUMA-5. 
These updates will be incorporated into product information globally. 
No  significant  safety  issues  for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  emerged  following  the  commercialization  of  this 
product, and the overall benefit-risk evaluation for axicabtagene ciloleucel continues to be positive. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database included 124 FL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in the ZUMA-5 trial. The 
initial analysis cutoff date is March 12, 2020, which represents the 12 months follow-up data. Additional 
safety data were provided from the follow-up analysis 1, with a data cutoff date of 14 September 2020. 
This prespecified analysis was performed when at least 80 subjects with FL had had the opportunity to be 
followed for 18 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (the median actual study follow-up time was 
20.34 months, range: 0.3 to 37.7 months; 73% had a potential study follow-up time of at least 18 months). 
For this assessment report, mostly the data from the 18 months follow-up were used. Yet the 18 months 
follow up is still considered rather short.  
Essentially, the AEs and risks are similar to what has been described for other CAR T cell therapies and for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications. No further risks and AEs could be identified which would be 
specific  for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  or  for  the  indication  to  be  treated  with  KTE-X19.  The  toxicity 
management plans are presented in the SmPC and are in line with the general management plans for this 
product class.

risks 
(CRS, 
neurologic 
events, 
cytopenias, 
infections, 
and 
hypogammaglobulinemia)  were  largely  reversible  and  manageable  with  supportive  care  and  medical 
interventions.  
In general, a lower incidence of CRS (78%) and worst Grade 3 CRS (6%) was observed in the FL patients 
in the ZUMA-5 study (vs. 93% and 9%, respectively, in patients with aggressive lymphoma; ZUMA-1 Phase 
1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2, ZUMA-9 Cohort 1, and ZUMA-12). This aspect could be attributed to the 
indolent type of the disease, but also the increased awareness in the clinical sites and the experience in 
treating CRS patients.  
In addition, the number of patients with neurologic AEs (56%) and worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic AEs 
(15%) in the FL patients in the ZUMA-5 study seems to be a bit lower than what is known for this drug 
class (vs. 68% and 31%, respectively, in patients with aggressive lymphoma; ZUMA-1 Phase 1 and Phase 
2  Cohorts  1  and  2,  ZUMA-9  Cohort  1,  and  ZUMA-12).  However,  six  subjects  with  FL  had  Grade  1  or  2 
neurologic  events  with  an  onset  >  80  days  after  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion,  2  of  which  were 
deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. There were 11 subjects with FL who had neurologic events that 
occurred > 30 days but < 200 days after the axicabtgene ciloleucel infusion. All of these neurologic events 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 76/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
were  Grade  1  except  for  the  events  of  Grade  2  amnesia  and  Grade  2  confusional  state  in  1  FL  subject. 
Three subjects with FL had neurologic events that were present beyond study Day 200, two of which were 
deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. Therefore, there might be a tendency for late neurotoxicity in 
this  setting.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  further  analysis  on  the  potential  causes  of  such  late 
toxicities, and to provide an in-depth analysis of late neurotoxicity incidence across all patients treated with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel. The analysis provided did not identify a consistent 
pattern in either the time to onset or common etiology for these neurologic events. It is considered though 
unlikely, that the toxicity from previous lines of chemotherapy would cause these late neurotoxicites, as 
alluded to by the MAH. Nonetheless, the MAH should further explore this in the future. It is agreed that the 
SmPC does not need to be modified at this stage, as the late neurotoxicities were reported as low grade 
toxicities.  
Among the important potential risks, no secondary malignancies were attributed to axicabtagene ciloleucel, 
no confirmed cases of immunogenicity were identified, no subjects tested positive for RCR, no cases of TLS 
or GvHD were identified.  
There was a slight tendency toward a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia (14% vs 27%), worst 
Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related AEs (52% vs 65%), infections (47% vs 59%), and worst 
Grade 3 or higher infections (10% vs 24%) in females. This trend was already observed for axicabtagene 
ciloleucel in the previous indication; however, no potential causes were identified so far, and seems to occur 
irrespective of the indication.  
Compared with subjects who had relapsed, subjects with refractory disease showed a trend toward a higher 
incidence  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel-related  SAEs  (23%  vs  35%)  and  serious  CRS  (5%  vs  15%). 
Additionally, compared with subjects who were not in the double refractory subgroup, subjects in the double 
refractory  subgroup  showed  a  trend  towards  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  (42%  vs  56%),  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel-related SAEs (24% vs 47%), worst Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related SAEs (18% 
vs 28%), and serious neurologic events (11% vs 25%). These aspects seem to be specific for these disease 
subgroups and dependent of disease status.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  important  identified  risks  for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  the  FL  indication  are  CRS,  neurotoxicity, 
cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. There are some potential risks linked to the use of this 
product: secondary malignancy, immunogenicity, RCR, tumor lysis syndrome, and aggravation of GvHD. 
Essentially, the AEs and risks are similar to what has been described for other CAR T cell therapies and for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel in the previous indication. No further risks and AEs could be identified which would 
be specific for axicabtagene ciloleucel or for the indication to be treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted/was requested to submit an updated RMP version 7.0 with this application. The 
(main) proposed RMP changes are summarized in the below sections. 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 77/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
General comments: 
RMP Part I “Product overview” section “indication(s) in the EEA” has been amended to include the new 
indication of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Since the current indications (DLBCL and PMBCL) have been added 
as proposed indications, amendments to this section are warranted. Only the new applied indication 
should be mentioned as “proposed”. 
Safety Specification 
Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
Module SI ‘Epidemiology of the indication and target population’ was updated satisfactorily to include 
epidemiology data for the proposed new indication of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular 
lymphoma after three or more lines of systemic therapy.  
Clinical trial exposure 
Module SIII ‘Clinical trial exposure’ was adequately updated with regard to exposure information about 
e.g. dosage, duration, age group, gender, dose, ethnic origin for the proposed FL indication of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
Populations not studied in clinical trials 
Module SIV ‘Populations not studied in clinical trials’ – SIV.1 was updated with the ZUMA-5 study 
exclusion criteria. Additionally, section SIV.2 and SIV.3 were updated to include data from the ZUMA-5 
study. The proposed changes are considered acceptable.   
Post-authorisation experience 
Module SV ‘Post-authorisation experience’ was adequately updated with a new estimate of the 
postmarketing exposure.  
Identified and potential risks 
In the Module SVII, section SVII.3.1 ‘Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and 
missing information” has been updated with data from the ZUMA-5 study. The proposed changes are 
considered acceptable. 
Missing information  
In the Module SVII, the subsection ‘Use in non-Caucasian patient populations’ under section SVII.3.2 
‘missing information’ was updated to include data from the ZUMA-5 study. The proposed changes are 
considered acceptable.

Targeted follow-up questionnaires for CRS will be utilized as 
follow up to an ADR report to determine start and stop dates of 
the event, severity and seriousness, outcome, diagnostic 
results, whether alternative causes for signs and symptoms 
were ruled out, treatment provided, relevant medical history, 
additional medications. This questionnaire will also collect 
information on patients with underlying organ impairments 
(e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, pulmonary) who experience CRS. 
Targeted follow-up questionnaires for new malignancy will be 
utilized as follow up to AE reports to obtain further information 
regarding start and stop dates of the event, severity and 
seriousness, diagnostic results, pre-existing factors that may 
have contributed to the development of the new malignancy, 
relevant medical history and additional medications. 
Targeted follow-up questionnaires for “CD19 and CAR T levels 
after recurrence following initial response to Yescarta” will be 
utilized as a follow-up to AE reports to obtain further 
information regarding date of diagnosis, diagnostic results 
(CD19 status in tissue biopsy, presence of CAR T post infusion 
and at recurrence in blood), and additional information in case 
of CD19 negativity. 
The RMP was updated to include new targeted follow-up questionnaire of CD19 and CAR-T Levels after 
Recurrence Following Initial Response to Yescarta for the important potential risks of CD19 Negative 
Relapse and CAR-T Persistence in Relapsed Patients. The proposed targeted follow-up questionnaire is 
endorsed.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
Additional Risk Minimization Activity: HCP Educational Material 
HCP Educational Material 
Objective(s) 
To inform HCPs on how to monitor and manage symptoms associated with 
CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions and provide guidance on 
reporting these serious adverse reactions associated with Yescarta. 
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimization activity 
The HCP educational material will be provided at launch of the product and at 
the time of updates in each member state and will highlight the risks of 
Yescarta and will help ensure that the HCPs using Yescarta are made aware of 
the risks and will be able to monitor for them. The HCP educational material 
will also help HCPs ensure that they have access to a minimum of 1 dose of 
tocilizumab prior to Yescarta infusion. The treatment center must have access 
to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. CRS 
is not commonly observed with most anti-cancer medications. Therefore, 
HCPs may not be as experienced in managing these adverse reactions. CRS 
occurred in 93% of patients in ZUMA-1 Phase 1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2, 
and 82% of patients in ZUMA-5. The median time to onset for CRS was 2 
days for patients in ZUMA-1 and 4 days for patients in ZUMA-5, whilst the 
median time to onset for neurologic events was 5 days for patients in ZUMA-1 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2, and 7 days for patients in ZUMA-5. 
It is anticipated that HCP educational material will enhance early diagnosis 
and proper evidence-based management of these events, including 
information on when and how to use tocilizumab and/or steroids. The 
expected result is improvement in the outcomes of or mitigating severe, 
life-threatening, and fatal CRS and/or neurologic adverse reactions.  
Target audience and 
planned distribution 
path 
The HCP educational material targets HCPs who are likely to prescribe 
Yescarta. The method of delivery of the HCP educational material is 
determined on a Member State basis to align with local clinical organization.

HCP Educational Material 
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and 
criteria for success 
The evaluation of the effectiveness of HCP educational material will include 
the following: 
 
 
Evaluations of HCPs’ understanding of the risks of Yescarta by means 
of a prescriber survey. The objective of the prescriber survey is to 
assess the prescribers’ understanding of the risks of Yescarta. 
To meet this objective, the prescriber survey will: 
o  Assess whether every prescriber received the HCP educational 
material. 
o  Measure the prescribers’ understanding of known important 
identified risks associated with Yescarta. 
o  Assess whether prescribers understand how to identify and 
treat CRS or serious neurologic adverse reactions. 
  A post-marketing registry will assess the incidence of serious 
neurologic adverse reactions and CRS and will thus provide an 
outcome measure of the effectiveness of the risk minimization 
program. 
  A summary of all reported severe, life-threatening CRS and serious 
neurologic adverse reactions with an analysis of AEs outcomes and 
treatment. This will be presented within periodic safety reports. 
These activities will assess whether the HCP educational material is meeting 
its objectives. If the conclusion is that it is not, Kite Pharma will discuss with 
the Agency ways that this additional risk minimization activity can be 
modified. 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; CRS = cytokine release syndrome; HCP = healthcare professional. 
Additional Risk Minimization Activity: PAC 
PAC 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 88/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Objective(s) 
To inform patients of the risks of CRS and serious neurologic adverse 
reactions, associated with Yescarta. 
Rationale for the additional 
risk minimization activity 
For patients to share the information in the PAC with their HCPs. 
Easy and immediate patients’ access to information about the common 
signs and symptoms of CRS, and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
will promote early medical attention and treatment that will help 
mitigating the risks.  
Target audience and 
planned distribution path 
The target audience is patients who will be treated with Yescarta. The 
PAC will be part of the health care professional kit and will be provided to 
the patient by the hematologist/heme oncologist or nursing staff. 
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and criteria 
for success 
The evaluation of the effectiveness of the PAC will include the following: 
 
Prescriber survey to assess the physicians’ understanding of the 
key risks associated with Yescarta (e.g., CRS, serious neurologic 
adverse reactions).

Additional Risk Minimization Activity: Controlled Distribution Program 
Controlled Distribution Program 
Objective(s) 
To ensure that Yescarta is only administered in a qualified clinical setting. 
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimization activity 
To minimize the important risks of CRS and neurologic adverse reactions, 
clinical facilities are required to complete a formal site qualification process 
prior to ordering Yescarta. 
Target audience and 
planned distribution path 
The controlled distribution program targets clinical facilities in which 
Yescarta is administered. The process of qualification is carried out by the 
QA Site Qualification EU team at Kite Pharma EU BV. 
The site qualification process includes the following steps: 
 
Introduction to key Yescarta processes 
  Quality Audit 
 
 
Training of HCPs  
“Dry-run exercise” 
  Continued monitoring of compliance 
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and criteria 
for success 
The evaluation of the effectiveness of the controlled distribution program 
will include the following: 
  Collection of evidence for the training delivered to HCPs and other 
relevant site personnel during site qualification. 
  A post-marketing registry will assess the incidence of serious 
neurologic adverse reactions and CRS and will thus provide an 
outcome measure of the effectiveness of the risk minimization 
program. 
  A summary of all reported severe, life-threatening CRS and serious 
neurologic adverse reactions with an analysis of AE outcomes and 
treatment. This will be presented within periodic safety reports. 
These activities will assess whether the Controlled Distribution Program is 
meeting its objectives.  Effectiveness of the controlled distribution program 
will be reported in the PSUR. If the conclusion is that it is not, Kite Pharma 
will discuss with the Agency ways that this additional risk minimization 
activity can be modified.

Objective(s) 
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimization activity 
Target audience and 
planned distribution 
path 
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and 
criteria for success 
To ensure the appropriate handling, preparation and administration of 
Yescarta, and raise awareness of the SmPC recommendations for additional 
testing in case of secondary malignancy. 
To minimize the potential risks of decrease in viability of the product due to 
inappropriate preparation of the Yescarta infusion and secondary 
malignancy, HCPs will receive training materials which include instructions 
on the appropriate handling, preparation and administration of Yescarta and 
on sampling and management recommendations for secondary 
malignancies.  
The Guide to Handling, Method of Administration and Sampling 
Recommendations for Secondary Malignancies will target HCPs who are likely 
to be involved in the preparation of the Yescarta infusion and to the 
prescriber. The exact method of delivery of the HCP educational material will 
be determined on a Member State basis to align with local clinical 
organization. 
The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Guide to Handling, Method of 
Administration and Sampling Recommendations for Secondary Malignancies 
includes the following: 
  Collection of evidence that the training was delivered to HCPs and 
other relevant site personnel during site qualification. 
 
Prescriber survey will assess understanding of the key risk 
minimization messages associated with handling and administration 
of Yescarta. 
These activities will assess the effectiveness of the Guide to Handling, 
Method of Administration and Sampling Recommendations for Secondary 
Malignancies in meeting its objective. If the conclusion is that the objective 
is not being met, Kite Pharma will discuss with the Agency ways that this 
additional risk minimization activity can be modified. 
The section “Additional Risk Minimization Activity: Healthcare Provider (HCP) educational Material - 
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity” has been updated to include median time to onset 
and frequency for events of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) from both ZUMA-1 and ZUMA-5.  
Section V.3 “Summary of risk minimization measures” has been updated with minor editorial 
amendments. Additionally, updates to this section were made in accordance with the updates to Part III 
(PV Plan) to include event follow-up questionnaire as routine pharmacovigilance activity beyond adverse 
reactions reporting and signal detection for the important potential risks of CD19 negative relapse and 
CAR-T persistence in relapsed patients, and to align information on additional PhV activities with RMP Part 
III.2 and III.3.

• 
Annex 8: The MAH updated annex 8 with the changes in this RMP. 
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP in version 7.0 are acceptable.  
2.8.  Update of the Product Information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Yescarta The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The agreed indication is: “Yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular lymphoma (FL) after three or more lines of systemic therapy”. 
FL  is  one  of  the  second  most  common  type  of  lymphomas  representing  about  10-20%  of  all  NHL.  The 
clinical course of the disease is characterised by relapses, with progressively diminishing remission periods. 
The majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stage (III-IV according to Ann Arbor staging). One of 
the characteristics of the FL immunophenotype is the expression on the surface of tumour cells of CD19, 
which is a common target for different therapeutic modalities in patients with B-cell malignancies. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Although  newly  diagnosed  FL  of  low  grade  is  an  indolent  disease  and  patients  respond  well  to  first-line 
chemoimmunotherapy, most of patients relapse and received several treatments with different mechanisms 
of  action  in  second  and  third  line,  including  chemoimmunotherapy,  immunomodulating  agents  and  PI3K 
inhibitors. For a small proportion of selected patients stem cell transplant (auto- or allo-SCT) is an option. 
After 3, 4, 5 and 6 lines of therapy the overall survival is respectively 1.1, 0.9, 0.6 and 0.5 years (Batlevi 
et al., 2020). The disease remains incurable and there is a risk of histologic transformation to high grade 
NHL.  An  unmet  need  for  therapeutic  options  with  novel  mechanisms  of  action  and  manageable  toxicity, 
especially in late lines of relapsed and/or refractory disease, is recognised in this late clinical setting. 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 97/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study supporting this application is the single arm trial ZUMA-5 (KTE-C19-105), a Phase 
2 Multicenter Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (iNHL), which is ongoing in the US. The study includes patients with two histological types of 
indolent NHL (iNHL): FL and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). With regard to the indication R/R FL, only 
subjects classified FL Grade 1-3a have been included, since FL Grade 3b is treated as de novo DLBCL.  The 
results of the primary (cut-off date 12March 2020) and follow-up 18-month (cut-off date 14Sept 2020), 
and upon request, follow-up 24-month (cut-off date 31Mar2021) analyses have been submitted. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Objective response rate (ORR), defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) per Lugano 
classification and central assessment, was 91% (95% CI; 82%, 96%) in FL subjects after 3 or more prior 
lines of therapy (FAS, leukapheresed patients). The CR rate was 79% in this population corresponding to 
the intended indication. Median DOR is 38.6 months (95% CI: 24.7, NE) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The treatment benefit cannot be comprehensively and comparatively assessed as it was only studied in a 
single-arm trial.  
The major initial uncertainty was related to the discrepancy in the number of patients with histologically 
confirmed FL by local and retrospective central histopathological diagnosis. Confirmation of FL by central 
assessment  in  all  subjects,  relevant  for  the  intended  marketing  authorisation,  would  be  ideal  situation. 
However, the Applicant’s approach to provide new sets of populations under consideration of a more recent 
data  cut-off  date  (31  March  2021),  as  required,  and  to  revise  the  data  sets  for  FAS,  IAS  and  SAS  by 
excluding subjects with centrally confirmed non-FL (n=5 subjects), is considered acceptable, given that the 
following  revision  of  the  gathered  efficacy  and  safety  results  in  the  intended  target  population  did  not 
indicate  clinically  significant  changes.  It  is  known  from  scientific  literature  that  a  reliable  pathological 
diagnosis of FL depends largely on size and quality of the tissue sample, and that discordant histological 
findings across different biopsies are often observed.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AEs reported are similar to what has been described for other CAR T cell therapies and for axicabtagene 
ciloleucel in the other indications.  
The  most  significant  and  frequently  occurring  adverse  reactions  were  CRS  (77%),  infections  (59%)  and 
encephalopathy (47%). 
Serious  adverse  reactions  occurred  in  45%  of  patients.  The  most  common  serious  adverse  reactions 
included encephalopathy (16%), unspecified pathogen infections (12%), CRS (12%), bacterial infections 
(5%), fever (4%), viral infection (4%) and thrombosis (3%).  
The most common (≥5%) Grade 3 or higher non-haematological adverse reactions included encephalopathy 
(14%), unspecified pathogen infections (11%) and CRS (6%). 
EMA/622447/2022 
Page 98/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database included 124 FL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in the ZUMA-5 trial. Yet, 
the potential follow-up time of 18 months is still rather short. While this period would be enough to identify 
the  earlier  and  immediate  AEs,  there  are  certain  potential  risks  for  which  conclusive  data  could  not  be 
obtained  due  to  the  limited  follow-up  time.  Therefore,  aspects  regarding  secondary  malignancies, 
replication  competent  retrovirus  analysis  will  be  collected  in  the  PASS  registry  study  for  the  long-term 
follow-up. 
The  number  of  late  neurologic  toxicities  gave  additional  uncertainties.  Similarly,  the  higher  incidence  of 
toxicities in females remains an uncertainty for this product.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The observed high ORR and CR rates supported by DOR data designate that clinically meaningful benefit 
could be achieved at long term in the intended population of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) 
patients in 4L+ setting with poor prognosis and progressively increasing refractoriness to prior therapeutic 
modalities.  
The most important unfavourable effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a CAR T cell product in general are 
CRS,  neurotoxicity,  cytopenias,  infections  and  hypogammaglobulinaemia.  Generally  these  unfavourable 
effects  are  either  treatable  or  have  a  self-limiting  course  and  are  reversible.  The  potential  serious 
consequences of CRS have been recognised and treatment algorithms have been developed that are still 
being refined according to further experience. Overall considering the life-threatening disease the safety 
profile of KTE-X19 seems to be acceptable for the target population. Since the unfavourable effects are in 
line with the experience made with this drug class, the identified uncertainties and limitations are of limited 
relevance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
While compelling ORR and CR were reported and the depth of responses appears to be accompanied by 
their durability, uncertainty remains regarding the true magnitude of the effects, especially at long term, i. 
e. after Month 24. The currently limited follow-up does not allow to fully contextualise response data based 
on  PFS/OS  results.  The  safety  database  is  considered  sufficiently  characterised  due  to  data  available  in 
other patient populations, the toxicity is manageable and no new safety signals have been reported. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of axicabtagene is positive for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma 
(FL) after three or more lines of systemic therapy.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CAT considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
follicular lymphoma (FL) after three or more lines of systemic therapy. Consequently, sections 4.1, 
4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and Package Leaflet are proposed to be updated. As a consequence, 
the RMP (version 7.0) has been updated to align with the indication extension. 
 In addition, the applicant has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial corrections throughout 
the SmPC and package leaflet. Lastly, the newly assigned ATC code has been included in the SmPC. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Yescarta is not similar to Gavyzaro and Kymriah within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200 (See appendix 1). 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CAT reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

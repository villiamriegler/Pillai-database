Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
Data from trials with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients and healthy individuals showed 
overall delayed and reduced effect of and/or decreased exposure of prasugrel in the first two hours 
following co-administration of morphine at the same time. The interaction disappeared within 1 day. 
Similar results have been seen with other P2Y12 inhibitors. The proposed mechanism of this interaction 
is that opioid delays gastric ventricular emptying and thus reduces absorption of prasugrel. This is a 
well-known effect of morphine, however this interaction is considered clinically relevant, as analgesic 
treatment with morphine and inhibition of platelet function with, for example, P2Y12 inhibitors may be 
used in acute myocardial infarction. Some of the above studies suggested that intravenous drugs may be 
necessary if morphine is administered and fast P2Y12 inhibition is considered crucial. Based on the data 
presented, update of section 4.5 in the SmPC for prasugrel is considered relevant.

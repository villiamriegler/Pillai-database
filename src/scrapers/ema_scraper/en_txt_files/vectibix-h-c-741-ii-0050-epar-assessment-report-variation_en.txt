1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Amgen Europe B.V. submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 7 May 2013 an application for a variation. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary name: 
Presentations: 
Vectibix 
panitumumab 
See Annex A 
The following variation was requested: 
Variation requested 
C.1.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) 
Type 
II 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
an approved one 
The MAH applied for a restriction of the indication for the treatment of colorectal cancer to patients 
with wild-type RAS tumours. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC. In addition, the MAH proposed to update the safety information regarding use of Vectibix in 
patients with mutant RAS tumours in sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9.0. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, 127a, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/146/2009 on the granting of a class waiver.  
However, the Agency considered that the requirements of article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
were not applicable, as this application was not for a new indication, a new pharmaceutical form or a 
new route of administration. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Panitumumab, a recombinant fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity and 
specificity to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane glycoprotein that 
is a member of a subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases.  EGFR promotes cell growth in normal 
epithelial tissues and is expressed on a variety of tumour cells.  
Panitumumab binds to the ligand binding domain of EGFR and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation 
induced by all known EGFR ligands.  Binding of panitumumab to EGFR results in internalisation of the 
receptor, inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis and decreased interleukin 8 (IL-8) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.  The KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral 
oncogene homologue) gene encodes a small, GTP-binding protein involved in signal transduction.  A 
variety of stimuli, including that from the EGFR activates KRAS which in turn stimulates other 
intracellular proteins to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and angiogenesis.  Activating mutations 
in the KRAS gene occur frequently in a variety human tumours and have been implicated in both 
oncogenesis and tumour progression.  KRAS mutations have been shown to be a negative predictive 
biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy. 
Vectibix (panitumumab) was first authorised in the EU on 3 December 2007.  Based on available data 
at the time of the application, panitumumab was granted a conditional marketing authorisation.  
Vectibix is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC): 
• 
• 
• 
in first-line in combination with FOLFOX  
in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan).   
as monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing 
chemotherapy regimens. 
The recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg/kg of bodyweight given once every two weeks.

With this variation application, the MAH proposed to further restrict the metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) indication for Vectibix to patients with wild-type RAS (not only KRAS) tumour status. This 
proposal stemmed from the Annex II condition on the development of new biomarkers with potential 
to improve the benefit/risk balance of panitumumab. Towards fulfilling this condition, the MAH 
submitted prospective-retrospective analyses of RAS and BRAF in Study 20050203 (first-line 
combination with FOLFOX) with the latest Renewal application of the conditional Marketing 
Authorisation (EMEA/H/C/000741/R/0043, EC Decision date: 14 January 2013). Additional 
confirmatory data from studies 20020408 (last-line monotherapy study) and 20070509 (first-line 
combination with FOLFOX6 vs bevacizumab plus FOLFOX6) have become available and the MAH 
concluded that additional RAS mutations are negative predictive biomarkers of the benefit-risk of 
panitumumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and proposed to restrict the 
indication of panitumumab to wild-type RAS rather than KRAS mCRC. The relevant contra-indication, 
posology recommendation and warnings against use of Vectibix with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy 
in patients with mutant RAS tumours were proposed to be updated in accordance. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The RAS gene family has three broadly expressed members: KRAS, neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) 
oncogene homolog (NRAS), and the v-Ha-ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene (HRAS). The three 
different isoforms share sequence identity at all regions regulating activation state and effector 
functions, and high sequence similarity in most of the remaining gene. The region of variability 
between the isoforms, containing only 23 to 24 amino acids, is involved in membrane binding. Each 
member of the RAS gene family functions as an oncogene when mutated by driving constitutive 
ligand-independent mitogen activated protein kinase signalling. 
Whereas the KRAS exon 2 mutations that alter codons 12 and 13 are the most frequently occurring 
RAS mutations in CRC (approximately 40%), a number of mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 activate 
RAS family oncogenes. Somatic KRAS mutations within exon 3 and 4 and NRAS mutations within 
exons 2, 3, and 4 have also been documented in CRC and collectively occur in approximately 9% to 
19% of wild-type KRAS exon 2 CRC cases. Thus, KRAS and NRAS mutations (in exons 2, 3, and 4) 
beyond KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) may be predictive biomarkers for panitumumab treatment. 
HRAS CRC mutations are infrequently reported (< 1%), and are thus not considered to be relevant in 
this population. In the proposed Product Information, KRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4) and NRAS (exons 2, 3, 
and 4) are collectively referred to as RAS. 
BRAF is an oncogene that functions downstream of the RAS proteins and is known to be mutated in 
approximately 10% to 15% of wild-type KRAS tumours. Somatic exon 15 BRAF mutations have been 
correlated with a poor prognosis; however, it is unclear whether these mutations are also predictive 
for the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibodies. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials (20020408, 20050203, 20070509) were performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community (20020408, 20050203, 20070509) were carried out in accordance with the ethical 
standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The MAH had taken a stepwise approach to determining the clinical phenotype of the above-mentioned 
biomarkers by first broadly interrogating mCRC tumour samples banked from the phase 3, 
randomised, controlled study of panitumumab monotherapy (study 20020408) for mutations within 
genes that encode key components of the EGFR signalling pathway. In 2009 and 2010, a multi-gene 
sequencing project had been performed using the banked tumour specimens from study 20020408.  
Based on hypothesis-generating data from the monotherapy 20020408 study, the effect of RAS and 
BRAF mutation status on the efficacy and safety of panitumumab was further evaluated in a 
predefined retrospective subset analysis of study 20050203, the phase 3, randomised study of 
panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Tumour samples from patients who had 
wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC were further tested for mutations in KRAS exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 
(codons 117/146); NRAS exon 2 (codons12/13), exon 3 (codon 61), and exon 4 (codon 117/146); and 
BRAF exon 15 (codon 600) using both Sanger sequencing and SURVEYOR/WAVE laboratory-developed 
tests. In addition, as somatic mutations have been identified in KRAS and NRAS at exon 3 (codon 59) 
(COSMIC database, February 2013), and KRAS codon 59 mutations have been specifically identified in 
CRC, a post-hoc, exploratory analysis of RAS mutations including codon 59 was performed after this 
mutation was discovered in 7 patients in Study 20050203. 
Individuals involved in the testing were blinded to treatment allocation and outcome. DNA extractions 
were performed using the Qiagen DNA Mini Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
For the Sanger sequencing analysis, PCR amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using the ABI 
BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit and the ABI 3730XL Automated Sequencer. For the SURVEYOR/WAVE 
Vectibix

analysis, double-stranded PCR amplicons were melted and cooled to form duplexed DNA fragments. 
When mutant DNA was present, the duplexed DNA was a mixture of WT:WT, MT:MT, and WT:MT. The 
mixture was treated with SURVEYOR Nuclease and the resulting DNA fragments were analysed on an 
HPLC system to detect DNA fragment size. Mutant:wild-type heteroduplexes result in variant size 
fragments. This assay was run in tandem with the Sanger sequencing and was used to confirm the 
presence of low levels of mutant DNA. Results presented below were the ones obtained by the Sanger 
sequencing analysis.  
The primary endpoints of the updated efficacy analysis by RAS status were PFS and OS. Secondary 
endpoints included 60-day PFS, ORR, complete resection of metastases in subjects with liver only 
disease at baseline. The primary efficacy analyses for PFS and OS in this updated analysis used the 
primary PFS and OS data cut-off dates for Study 20050203, respectively (30 September 2008 for PFS 
and 28 August 2009 for OS). Objective response rate and complete resection were analysed using the 
primary PFS data cut-off date. The data cut-offs were event-driven as pre-specified in the primary 
Statistical Analysis Plan. These data were used to make definitive conclusions regarding treatment 
outcomes.  
Pre-specified efficacy analyses by RAS status using the final data cut-off date (02 August 2010) were 
further provided for PFS and OS for descriptive purposes. An exploratory, updated analysis of OS by 
RAS status (as of 24 January 2013) was also provided. 
2.3.2.  Results 
20020408 (last line monotherapy study) 
Preliminary data supporting the predictive value of KRAS mutations beyond exon 2 and of NRAS 
mutations for response to panitumumab came from the monotherapy study 20020408. 
Although few subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 status were identified who had other RAS mutations 
(n = 22), the results of this retrospective analysis were consistent with the hypothesis that all 
activating RAS mutations are negatively predictive of outcomes with panitumumab therapy. In study 
20020408, 11 of 72 subjects (15%) with wild-type RAS tumours receiving panitumumab had an 
objective response compared to only 1 of 95 subjects (1%) with mutant RAS tumour status. Moreover, 
panitumumab treatment was associated with improved PFS compared to BSC in subjects with wild-
type RAS tumours, but not in subjects with tumours harbouring a RAS mutation (see table below). An 
analysis of BRAF mutations indicated that BRAF status was prognostic for outcomes regardless of 
panitumumab treatment.

20050203 (first line study, combination with FOLFOX) 
The primary body of evidence regarding the predictive value of RAS (KRAS and NRAS) mutations for 
response to panitumumab were derived from the first-line combination with FOLFOX study 20050203.  
In this study, the overall RAS ascertainment rate was high (90%; 1060 of 1183 randomised subjects 
including the previous results by KRAS exon 2 status), minimising the potential for systematic 
ascertainment bias. In the original primary analysis of Study 20050203, 656 patients (325 
panitumumab plus FOLFOX, 331 FOLFOX alone) had wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumours. Tumour samples 
from 641 of these patients (98%) were acceptable to be tested for mutations in KRAS exon 3 and 4 
and NRAS exon 2, 3, and 4. Few samples (≤ 3%) failed testing; reasons included no polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) product or poor sequencing quality. 
Of the 656 patients with wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumours, new mutations were identified for tumours in 
108 patients (16%). The percentage of patients with newly identified mutations was similar between 
the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm (51/325 patients, 16%) and the FOLFOX alone arm (57/331 
patients, 17%). Mutations were identified in: 
• 
• 
• 
KRAS exons 3 and 4 for 60 patients (9%) 
NRAS exons 2 and 3 for 48 patients (7%) 
with no patients testing positive for mutations in NRAS exon 4. 
These results are consistent with recently published rates of mCRC mutations in KRAS exon 3 (5%), 
KRAS exon 4 (6%), NRAS exon 2 (4%), and NRAS exon 3 (3%), supporting the validity of the data. 
Overall, 512 patients with evaluable samples had wild-type RAS tumour status (259 panitumumab plus 
FOLFOX, 253 FOLFOX alone) and 548 had mutant RAS tumour status (272 panitumumab plus FOLFOX, 
276 FOLFOX alone). These patients comprised the main analysis sets for the predefined retrospective 
efficacy analysis (the Wild-type RAS Efficacy Analysis Set and the Mutant RAS Efficacy Analysis Set). 
Subjects with newly identified RAS mutations (i.e., those previously identified as having wild-type 
KRAS exon 2 status) were included in the Wild-type KRAS Exon 2 Mutant RAS Efficacy Analysis Set.

Demographics and baseline disease characteristics in the predefined retrospective subset analysis 
were similar to those observed in the primary analysis by KRAS exon 2 status (data not shown).

In terms of subgroups analyses, the treatment effect of panitumumab on PFS in the Wild-type RAS 
Efficacy Analysis Set was generally consistent across subpopulations defined by baseline covariates, 
with the exception of subjects who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 2 or 
who were ≥ 75 years of age. In these subgroups, the hazard ratios favoured the FOLFOX alone arm. 
For OS, the treatment effect of panitumumab was consistent across subpopulations with the exception 
of subjects who had an ECOG status of 2 (data not shown). 
An analysis using an alternative definition of PFS that excluded deaths occurring > 60 days after the 
last evaluable tumour assessment or randomization date (whichever was later) was consistent with the 
main results (data not shown). 
A best objective complete or partial response by central radiological assessment was achieved by 149 
subjects (59%; 95% CI: 52%, 65%) in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm and 114 subjects (46%; 
95% CI: 40%, 53%) in the FOLFOX alone arm. The adjusted odds ratio for objective response was 
1.63 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.38), favouring the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm, and the p-value was 0.009. 
In patients with mutant RAS tumours, the ORR in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm was 40% (95% 
CI: 34%, 46%) and in the FOLFOX alone arm it was 43% (95% CI: 37%, 49%) with an adjusted odds 
ratio of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.25). In subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 mutant RAS tumours, 
fewer subjects had an objective response in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm (40%; 95% CI: 26%, 
Vectibix 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/367675/2013 
Page 12/32 
 
 
 
 
 
55%) than in the FOLFOX alone arm (54%; 95% CI: 40%, 67%), with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.59 
(95% CI: 0.24, 1.38), favouring the FOLFOX alone arm. 
Among the 90 subjects with metastasis to only the liver at baseline, complete resection (primary 
analysis) was performed in 15/49 (31%: 95% CI: 18%, 45%) subjects in the panitumumab plus 
FOLFOX arm and 7/41 (17%; 95% CI: 7%, 32%) subjects in the FOLFOX alone arm; the adjusted 
odds ratio was 2.31 (95% CI: 0.74, 7.66), and the p-value was 0.179. Among the 16 subjects with 
wild-type KRAS exon 2 mutant RAS tumours who had metastasis only to the liver at baseline, the 
complete resection rate was 13% in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm and 25% in the FOLFOX alone 
arm (adjusted odds ratio 0.55 [95% CI: 0.01, 10.49]). 
Results of quantitative interaction tests comparing the magnitude of the relative treatment effect on 
PFS between the wild-type and different mutation efficacy analysis sets are presented in the following 
Tables 5 and 6. 
Table 5: Quantitative Interaction Test; Wild-type and Mutant RAS Efficacy Analysis Sets; 
study 20050203 
Table 6: Quantitative Interaction Test; Wild-type and Wild-type KRAS Exon 2 Mutant RAS 
Efficacy Analysis Sets; study 20050203 
Similarly, quantitative interaction test comparing the magnitude of the relative treatment effect on OS 
between the Wild-type and Mutant RAS Efficacy Analysis Sets indicated that the hazard ratios differed 
in these datasets for the primary (p = 0.004), final (p = 0.006), and exploratory updated (p = 0.001) 
data cut-off dates. In a post-hoc quantitative interaction test comparing the magnitude of the relative 
treatment effect on OS between the Wild-type RAS and the Wild-type KRAS Exon 2 Mutant RAS 
Efficacy Analysis Sets, the p-value from the primary analysis was 0.071. The p-values were 0.030 and 
0.013 for the final and exploratory updated data cut-off dates, respectively. 
With regard to BRAF, Of the 656 subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumours, a BRAF exon 15 
mutation was identified in 53 subjects (8%). The PFS and OS hazard ratios favoured panitumumab in 
the subgroup with tumours that were wild-type KRAS exon 2 and wild-type BRAF (regardless of other 
RAS mutations) (PFS: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.94]; OS: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.00]), and showed 
improvement with panitumumab therapy in the subgroup with tumours that were wild-type KRAS exon 
2 and mutant BRAF (PFS: 0.58 [95% CI: 0.29, 1.15]; OS: 0.90 [95% CI: 0.46, 1.76]). In addition, the 
PFS and OS hazard ratios favoured panitumumab among subjects with wild-type RAS and BRAF 
tumours (PFS: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.87]; OS: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.96]) and among subjects with 
wild-type RAS mutant BRAF tumours (PFS: 0.58 [95% CI: 0.29, 1.15]; OS: 0.90 [95% CI: 0.46, 
1.76]). The OS hazard ratios (wild-type vs mutant) from a Cox proportional hazards model that 
explored the prognostic value of the genotypes in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 dataset suggested a 
Vectibix

prognostic effect favouring wild-type status for the BRAF subgroup regardless of treatment: FOLFOX 
alone: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.29, 0.70]; panitumumab plus FOLFOX: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.63]; all 
subjects: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.58]. 
20070509 (first line study, combination with FOLFOX6, comparison with bevacizumab) 
Supportive preliminary data evaluating additional RAS mutations in the first-line setting were also 
available from study 20070509, a phase 2 MAH-sponsored study that estimated the treatment effect 
(i.e., with no formal hypothesis testing) of panitumumab plus FOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus 
FOLFOX6 in previously untreated subjects with mCRC. This study was originally conducted in subjects 
with wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumours, and a prospective analysis was conducted to detect further 
mutations in KRAS exon 3 (codon 59/61) and exon 4 (codons 117/146); NRAS exon 2 (codons 12/13), 
exon 3 (codon 59/61), and exon 4 (codon 117/146); and BRAF exon 15 (codon 600) using the same 
laboratory-developed tests as those used for the RAS/BRAF analysis in study 20050203. The initial 
ascertainment rate for the updated analysis was 75%. Results are presented in the following Table 7.

2.3.3.  Discussion 
Based on preliminary hypothesis-generating data from monotherapy study 20020408, study 20050203 
was selected for additional analyses as it was a large, well-controlled study with sample availability for 
the required biomarkers. In addition, this study had previously demonstrated a negative treatment 
effect of panitumumab in patients with mutant KRAS exon 2 tumour status, thus providing the 
appropriate backdrop to evaluate the clinical phenotype of additional, potential activating RAS 
mutations. 
The study was originally unselected for KRAS status, but the protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan were 
modified to prospectively evaluate the results by KRAS status. KRAS testing in the original primary 
analysis was performed by an independent central laboratory blinded to treatment and outcomes using 
an investigational use only (IUO) KRAS mutation test kit that detected the 7 most common mutations 
occurring in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) of the KRAS gene. KRAS assay results were obtained for more 
than 90% of all randomised subjects.

The current predefined retrospective subset analysis of additional RAS mutations was pre-specified in 
a supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan. Although this biomarker analysis was retrospective and 
exploratory in nature, it was conducted under the rigorous statistical standards employed for a 
prospective analysis to enable robust conclusions on the predictive value of RAS and BRAF mutation 
status. The 20050203 study was an adequate, well-conducted, and well-controlled trial with one of the 
largest sample sizes in a mCRC study. Consistent effort was put forth to ensure that all possible 
samples were collected and tested (and re-tested if the first test failed), with the goal of reaching a 
90% ascertainment rate. The detailed supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan was finalised before the 
RAS and BRAF test results became available. Sanger sequencing is the most commonly used approach 
for mutation testing, and is widely regarded as the gold standard. Results from the SURVEYOR/WAVE 
system were identical to the Sanger sequencing results. 
In the previously reported primary analysis of Study 20050203, a statistically significant improvement 
in PFS and a non-significant trend for improvement in OS were observed following treatment with 
panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX compared with FOLFOX alone among subjects with wild-
type KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) mCRC. However, in the last updated analysis (2013), an 
increase in median OS of 4.4 months was reported, which was statistically significant. In contrast, PFS 
and OS outcomes favoured the FOLFOX alone arm in subjects with mutant KRAS exon 2 tumours. 
In this supplemental, prospective-retrospective, exploratory biomarker analysis, additional RAS 
mutations (ie, KRAS exons 3, 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, 4) and mutations in BRAF exon 15 were 
assessed to determine their ability to predict outcomes following administration of panitumumab. 
Tumours from subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 status were tested for mutations in KRAS exons 3 
and 4, NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4, and BRAF exon 15, and key efficacy and safety analyses were 
repeated for the newly identified datasets based on RAS (including KRAS exon 2) and RAS/BRAF 
mutation status. The RAS ascertainment rate was 90% overall (1060 of 1183 randomized subjects), 
minimizing the potential for significant ascertainment bias. The RAS/BRAF ascertainment rate was 
89% (1047 of 1183 randomized subjects). 
The efficacy results from the supplemental biomarker analysis suggest that additional activating 
mutations in RAS beyond KRAS exon 2 were negatively predictive for panitumumab in combination 
with FOLFOX compared with FOLFOX alone. Improvements in PFS and OS outcomes were observed for 
wild-type RAS tumours compared with wild-type KRAS tumours. In the OS update analysis, median OS 
was increased by 5.6 months (highly significant difference); with more OS events and greater follow 
up time, the results from this post-hoc OS update analysis may be a more reliable estimate of OS. 
Compared with FOLFOX alone, panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX demonstrated improvement 
in both PFS and OS among subjects with wild-type RAS tumours. Conversely, differences between 
treatment arms that favoured the FOLFOX alone arm (relative to the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm) 
were observed for PFS and OS among subjects with mutant RAS tumours. 
The results for subjects with wild-type RAS tumours were improved from what was previously reported 
for subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumours, and the results for subjects with mutant RAS 
tumours were consistent with what was previously reported for subjects with mutant KRAS exon 2 
tumours. In addition, PFS and OS were numerically inferior among subjects with newly identified RAS 
mutations (i.e., wild-type KRAS exon 2 mutant RAS) who received panitumumab plus FOLFOX 
compared with those who received FOLFOX alone. 
In the last OS update analysis (24 January 2013 data cut-off), 204 subjects (79%) in the 
panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm and 218 subjects (86%) in the FOLFOX alone arm of the Wild-type 
RAS Efficacy Analysis Set had died. The median OS was 25.8 months (95% CI: 21.7, 29.7) in the 
panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm and 20.2 months (95% CI: 17.6, 23.6) in the FOLFOX alone arm, an 
absolute difference of 5.6 months. The hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazards ratio 
Vectibix 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/367675/2013 
Page 15/32 
 
 
 
was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.94), favouring the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm. The stratified log-rank 
p-value was 0.009. 
In terms of subgroups analyses for PFS and OS, the findings are consistent with the original primary 
analysis of Study 20050203 in subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 status. Section 4.4 of the 
panitumumab Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) currently states that for patients with ECOG 
2 performance status, assessment of benefit-risk is recommended prior to initiation of panitumumab in 
combination with chemotherapy, as a positive benefit-risk balance has not been documented in 
patients with ECOG 2 performance status. 
The ORR and liver resection rates were higher in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm compared with 
the FOLFOX alone arm among subjects with wild-type RAS tumours in the primary analysis. In 
contrast, no difference in ORR was observed between the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm  and 
FOLFOX alone arm in subjects with mutant RAS tumours. In subjects with wild-type KRAS exon 2 
mutant RAS tumours, fewer subjects had an objective response in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm 
than in the FOLFOX alone arm. 
Quantitative interaction test comparing the magnitude of the relative treatment effect on PFS between 
the Wild-type and Mutant RAS (or Wild-type KRAS Exon 2 Mutant RAS) Efficacy Analysis Sets 
supported the negative predictive value of additional activating RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 
for outcomes with panitumumab treatment. Similarly, a trend towards increasing strength of the 
interaction with greater OS event ascertainment was noted further lending support to the negative 
predictive value of additional activating RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 for outcomes with 
panitumumab treatment. 
The results from the RAS/BRAF efficacy analysis sets suggest that while BRAF mutation status is 
prognostic of outcome regardless of treatment, it is not predictive of the effect of panitumumab 
therapy in this analysis. The OS hazard ratios (wild-type vs mutant) from a Cox proportional hazards 
model that explored the prognostic value of the genotypes in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 dataset 
suggested a prognostic effect favouring wild-type status for the BRAF subgroup regardless of 
treatment. 
Finally, in supportive study 20070509 and as was observed in study 20050203, both PFS and OS 
favoured the panitumumab arm relative to the control arm for subjects with wild-type RAS tumours; 
however, PFS favoured the control arm for subjects with newly detected RAS (i.e. non-exon 2 KRAS 
and NRAS) mutations. OS appeared to favour the panitumumab arm in subjects with newly detected 
RAS mutations, although these data were based on a small number of events. 
Based on these data, the MAH’s initial position was that the predictive value of additional activating 
mutations in RAS for outcomes with panitumumab treatment has been demonstrated but that the level 
of evidence for panitumumab in the monotherapy setting does not have sufficient statistical rigor yet. 
Controlled data are not yet available by RAS status for panitumumab in the second-line setting in 
combination with FOLFIRI.  
The CHMP questioned the rationale for proposing a change to the indication of panitumumab restricted 
to its combination to FOLFOX. Although the number of additional mutations identified in the 
monotherapy trial is very small, the data clearly show similar trends to those observed in study 
20050203. More importantly, given the common function of NRAS and KRAS isoforms, it is not 
biologically plausible that the impact of mutations in the NRAS gene on the therapeutic effect of 
panitumumab only manifests when panitumumab is administered as first-line therapy in combination 
with FOLFOX. Therefore, the MAH agreed to propose a restriction of the indication of Vectibix to wild-
type RAS tumours regardless of the line of therapy.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
2.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Subjects who received at least 1 dose of panitumumab or chemotherapy in study 20050203 were 
included in safety analyses. The safety results discussed below are based on the final analysis data 
cut-off date (02 August 2010). Key safety analyses (adverse event summary and tabulation of adverse 
events of interest) were repeated using the later exploratory OS update data cut-off date 
(24 January 2013) but no changes to the adverse event profile of panitumumab plus FOLFOX were 
observed in the OS update analysis compared with the previous analysis. 
2.4.2.  Results 
The subject incidence rate of adverse events by severity in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX vs. FOLFOX 
alone arms of the study for RAS was similar to KRAS. 
Table 8: Incidence rate of adverse events by severity and RAS status; study 20050203 
The subject incidence rates of the most frequent adverse events with a greater than 5% difference by 
preferred term in the panitumumab plus FOLFOX vs. FOLFOX alone for RAS were similar to KRAS.

2.4.3.  Discussion 
A comparison of the safety data in subjects administered panitumumab plus FOLFOX over FOLFOX 
alone shows that the adverse event profile is similar for subjects with wild-type RAS vs. wild-type 
KRAS and mutant RAS vs. mutant KRAS. In these groups of subjects, there were no appreciable 
differences in the proportion of adverse events, including serious events, severe events by CTCAE 
grade, events leading to study discontinuation, and adverse events of interest. There were no new 
safety signals observed in subjects with wild-type RAS mCRC tumours administered panitumumab plus 
FOLFOX chemotherapy.

The proposed changes to the educational materials are included in Annexes 10 and 11 to the RMP and 
are considered appropriate. 
The proposal to circulate a DHPC is endorsed.  The DHPC should be sent to medical oncologists, 
pathologists responsible for testing mCRC tumour samples for RAS status and chief pharmacists.   
The PRAC, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indications 
The CHMP endorsed the advice without changes and considered the RMP which was finally submitted 
to have addressed the PRAC outstanding issues and to be acceptable. 
2.6.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
The  CHMP  considered  that  a  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  (DHPC)  was  needed  to 
communicate  on  the  restriction  of  the  indication  to  patients  with  wild-type  RAS  tumour  status,  as 
inferior  PFS  and  OS  have  been  shown  in  patients  with  RAS  mutations  beyond  KRAS  exon  2  who 
received  Vectibix  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  chemotherapy  versus  FOLFOX  alone.The  MAH  should 
agree  the  translations  and  local  specificities  of  the  DHPC  with  national  competent  authorities.  The 
DHPC  should  be  sent  upon  receipt  of  the  Commission  Decision  with  the  revised  SmPC  with  the 
changes  highlighted  to  medical  oncologists,  pathologists  responsible  for  testing  mCRC  tumour 
samples for RAS status and chief pharmacists.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Following a CHMP request to update the Product Information in line with new biomarker data at the 
time of the latest Renewal of the Vectibix conditional Marketing Authorisation 
(EMEA/H/C/000741/R/0043, EC Decision date: 14 January 2013), the MAH submitted the full analysis 
of the updated results of Study 20050203 taking into account not only KRAS mutations but also NRAS 
and BRAF mutations. Additional preliminary results from a phase II study that also evaluated the 
combination with FOLFOX (20070509) and from the pivotal monotherapy trial (20020408) were also 
presented. 
Based on these analyses, it is clear that additional RAS mutations outside those initially investigated in 
the KRAS exon 2 (codons 12/13) improve the efficacy of panitumumab therapy without altering its 
safety, and therefore, improve the benefit/risk balance of panitumumab in the approved indications. In 
the most recent survival analysis of the first-line trial, an improvement in overall survival of almost 6 
months was shown with the addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX in patients wild-type RAS tumours 
(hazard ratio = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.94]; p = 0.009). 
Vectibix 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/367675/2013 
Page 29/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, the safety profile of panitumumab in patients with wild-type RAS tumour status is 
indistinguishable from that in patients with wild-type KRAS tumour status and no new safety concerns 
have been identified in the further restricted target population. 
Since these additional mutations (KRAS and NRAS) already tend to be routinely screened for in clinical 
practice and since new commercial kits are also available, a change in the indication of panitumumab 
is fully justified. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered the benefit-risk balance of Vectibix in the modified indication: 
Vectibix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC): 
• 
• 
• 
in first-line in combination with FOLFOX 
in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan) 
as monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing 
chemotherapy regimens 
as being positive. No change to the conditions of the marketing is proposed other than ones necessary 
to reflect the updated indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.1.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
an approved one 
Type 
II 
Restriction of the indication for the treatment of colorectal cancer to patients with wild-type RAS 
tumours for Vectibix further to the CHMP request to update the PI in line with new biomarker data 
As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. In addition, sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 
and 4.5 of the SmPC are updated in order to amend the safety information regarding use of Vectibix in 
patients with mutant RAS tumours. The Package Leafle is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives and to add the 
details of the Croatian local representative in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

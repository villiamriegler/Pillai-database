COMP opinion (adoption via written 
29 July 2020 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2008 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 1.2 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to respiratory failure and reduced 
overall survival;  
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
Community, justifications have been provided that N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-
dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition.  
2.2.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication “treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients age 6 years and older 
who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene” falls entirely within the scope of the orphan 
indication of the designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 at the time of the review of the designation criteria. The prevalence is at 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
present estimated at 0.7 in 10,000 persons in the EU, based on evidence coming from relevant 
literature and European registries; 
• 
• 
the seriousness of the condition was estimated not to have changed at the time of the review of 
the designation criteria. The condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating, in particular 
due to the recurrent and resistant respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis. Death 
can occur from terminal respiratory failure or from haemoptysis due to erosion of large pulmonary 
vessels 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that ivacaftor may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition still holds. The significant benefit is based on the innovative mechanism of action 
of ivacaftor which, unlike the current products authorized in the EU, directly targets the underlying 
pathomechanism of the disease. Such mechanism of action has been shown to translate into 
clinical efficacy, as shown by a significant improvement in lung function, and a decrease in the 
number of pulmonary exacerbations. This constitutes a therapeutic advantage for the cystic fibrosis 
sub-population affected by the G551D gating mutation, when ivacaftor is either used alone or in 
combination with currently authorized products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, e.g. depending 
on the stage of the disease and the presence of pulmonary infections.  
2.3.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of type II 
variation (EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0063/G) 
The COMP opinion on the initial review of the orphan medicinal product designation in 2018 was based 
on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Kalydeco will be of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan 
condition is confirmed. This is based on clinical data showing the better tolerability of Symkevi in 
combination with Kalydeco in patients with homozygous F508del mutation who had to discontinue 
treatment with Orkambi, with comparable efficacy. The significant benefit of Symkevi in 
combination with Kalydeco in patients heterozygous for F508del and one of the residual function 
mutations included in the authorized therapeutic indication, for whom no specific CFTR modulator 
treatment is authorized, was considered justified based on clinical data showing improved efficacy 
versus placebo.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The present extension of indication to include the combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 
50 mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or 
heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation falls within the 
designated orphan condition ‘treatment of cystic fibrosis’. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP.   
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the seriousness of the condition since the time of orphan designation. 
The condition remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
There have been no significant changes in the prevalence of the condition since the time of orphan 
designation. The sponsor calculated the current prevalence based mainly on registry data, concluding 
with a proposed estimate of 0.78 in 10,000 in the EU. This is in line with previous designations 
although more recently some studies suggest a slight increase in prevalence (also as result of better 
available treatments), which would be around 0.9 in 10,000 (not significantly different from the one 
proposed by the sponsor). Recently the COMP has often adopted less than 1 in 10,000 so to allow for 
slight fluctuations of prevalence based on different sources. This figure is also used for the present 
application. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor correctly identifies the currently authorized treatments for the condition, which can be 
broadly classified in: (1) CFTR modulators (i.e. correctors and potentiators) which target the 
underlying cause of the disease, i.e. target CFTR dysfunction; and (2) therapies that manage the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

symptoms, complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy).  
Centrally authorized products for the treatment of CF in the EU are presented in Table 1 below (from 
the sponsor’s application).

The currently proposed indications of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio comprise subpopulations in 
which approved modulator therapies are available (F508del homozygous patients (F/F), patient 
heterozygous for F508del and a specific residual function mutation (F/RF) or a specific gating mutation 
(F/G).  For the populations heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) no 
treatment is available. 
The significant benefit is discussed for each of the patient populations covered by the authorized 
therapeutic indication.  
1.  F508Del homozygous patient population (approximately 45% of the CF patient population) 
Study 103 constitutes the main supportive evidence for the significant benefit in this patient group. 
This was a 4-week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in 
subjects 12 years of age and older with a F508del mutation on both alleles. The study assessed the 
added benefit of Kaftrio plus Kalydeco in comparison with Symkevi. In both cases the products were 
administered once a day, in combination regiment with Kalydeco, administered in the evening. 
Kaftrio plus Kalydeco resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of 
absolute change in ppFEV1 at Week 4 compared to Symkevi, with a least square (LS) mean treatment 
difference of 10.0 percentage points (P<0.0001). In addition Kaftrio plus Kalydeco resulted in a 
statistically significant decrease in sweat chloride (SwCl) compared to Symkevi, with a LS mean 
treatment difference of -45.1 mmol/L (P <0.0001 [95% CI: -50.1, -40.1]) for absolute change at 
Week 4, and in a significant increase in CFQ-R RD compared to Symkevi, with a LS mean treatment 
difference of 17.4 points (P<0.0001 [95% CI: 11.8, 23.0]) for absolute change at Week 4. Table 2 
below shows the results (from the CHMP assessment report).

The difference between the regimens containing Kalydeco plus Kaftrio or Symkevi in the homozygous 
population is clinically relevant. It is acceptable that no comparison has been performed versus 
Orkambi, since the latter (also authorized for the homozygous patient population) has shown more 
modest effects on FEV1 than Symkevi in earlier clinical studies. 
2.  Patients heterozygous for F508del and a MF (minimal function) mutation (approximately 25% of 
the total CF population).  
The significant benefit for this patient population is supported by study 102, which was a 24-week 
randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in subjects 12 years of 
age and older, who had an F508del mutation on one allele and an MF mutation on the other allele 
resulting in either no CFTR protein, or a protein that does not respond to IVA (Kalydeco) and TEZ/IVA 
(Symkevi) in vitro.  
The least squares (LS) mean treatment difference in the absolute change of ppFEV1 through week 24 
between Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco and placebo was 14.3 percentage points (CI 95%:  12.7, 
15.8; p<0.0001) in favour of the active treatment. The difference was already observable at week 4 
(13.7 percentage points; CI 95% 12.0, 15.3; p<0.0001). For pulmonary exacerbations, the rate ratio 
was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.55, p<0.0001) in favor of Kaftrio plus Kalydeco, with an overall reduction 
of 63% through Week 24. The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbations through Week 24 
was also in favour of Kaftrio plus Kalydeco (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; p<0.0001). A higher CRQ-R 
RD score was observed through Week 24 in the treated arm compared to the placebo arm (20.2 
points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; p<0.0001). In addition, a LS mean absolute change of 1.04 kg/m^2 (95% 
CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) compared to placebo at Week 24 was seen in body mass index (BMI)

The significant benefit in MF/F508Del mutation, for which no specific CFTR modulator is authorized, is 
therefore also supported. 
In conclusion, the significant benefit in homozygous F/F and in heterozygous F/MF mutations is 
supported by statistically significant and clinically relevant results of Kaftrio in combination with 
Kalydeco, versus Symkevi (in combination with Kalydeco) in F/F and versus placebo in F/MF, for which 
no CFTR modulator is specifically authorized.  The COMP granted a positive opinion based on the 
above.

4.  COMP position adopted on 29 July 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as "the condition") was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Kalydeco may be of significant benefit to those affected by 
the orphan condition is confirmed. In patients homozygous for the F508del mutation of cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), Kalydeco in combination regimen with 
Kaftrio showed better efficacy in the primary endpoint of lung function and in relevant secondary 
endpoints as compared to Symkevi, currently authorized for the condition. The combination 
regimen also showed clinical efficacy in patients heterozygous for F508del and minimal function 
mutations in the CFTR, for whom there is no specific CFTR modulator treatment authorized. The 
Committee considers that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected 
by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kalydeco, N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-
5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide, ivacaftor, for treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(EU/3/08/556) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

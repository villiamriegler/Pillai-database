issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

It remains unknown whether in human patients there could 
be a higher increase of urinary calcium after long-term 
treatment with sevelamer carbonate as compared to 
sevelamer hydrochloride.  
Non-clinical data suggest that long-term sevelamer 
carbonate may lead to a higher increase in urinary calcium as 
compared to what is observed with sevelamer hydrochloride. 
The relevance to humans of tumour formation in the urinary 
bladder in a rat carcinogenicity study with sevelamer 
hydrochloride is currently unknown. As the MAH did not

one additional five-year renewal on the basis of

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to include 
treatment with Renagel/Renvela. A total of seven cases were 
precaution information regarding difficulties in 
swallowing tablets and section 4.6. In order to add 
information on fertility. In addition, the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet has been 
updated. Furthermore, the WSA proposed this 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.0. Minor linguistic corrections have 
also been made to the Italian Annexes of Renvela. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of 
the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
identified.  Four of these patients recovered, for 2 the 
outcomes are unknown, and 1 case was fatal (acute MI). In 
five cases, patients had to be hospitalized/hospitalization 
was prolonged and/or patients underwent 
bronchoscopy/endoscopy. The CHMP subsequently identified 
12 cases in EudraVigilance on 17 March 2011. The CHMP 
requested the MAH to perform a cumulative review of cases 
of possible complications of swallowing Renagel/Renvela 
tablets, in particular focusing on the MedDRA PTs dysphagia, 
choking, aspiration, foreign body aspiration and oral 
administration complication. 
Swallowing is complex mechanical event, which can be 
influenced by a great many factors in Chronic Kidney Disease 
(CKD) patients. It is known for example that these patients 
often suffer from dysfunctional salivary glands. Furthermore, 
since hypertension is a frequent co-morbidity in CKD, water 
retention in the salivary gland’s secretory process is not 
uncommon. Furthermore, concomitant conditions common 
in CKD patients (e.g. xerostomia, diabetic autonomic 
neuropathy, GERD and iron deficiency) can affect 
swallowing. CKD patients are generally also an older 
population with age related physiological changes such as 
laryngeal nerve dysfunction contributing to dysphagia and 
swallowing complications. 
The MAH performed a number of searches in different media 
to identify relevant case reports. The MAH’s global safety 
database was queried for adverse events coding to specific 
Preferred Terms and MedDRA High Level Group Terms. In 
addition a search of medical literature was performed using 
Page 14/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pubmed, OVID, EMBASE, and Biosis to identify any 
publications discussing choking on or difficulty swallowing 
and sevelamer. 
In addition, both the Renagel Integrated Summary of Safety 
submitted with the Renagel MAA and the Renagel and 
Renvela post-approval safety studies were reviewed. Finally, 
The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database 
was also queried. During this query similar data regarding 
other drugs currently indicated for treatment of 
hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients was also retained. 
The CHMP conclusion is that the MAH has taken adequate 
action in regards to these sporadic reports of swallowing 
difficulties by adding a precaution on the use of tablet in 
swallowing-impaired patients in the product SPC. There are 
no clinical nor quality related reason as to why 
Renvela/Renagel should be more difficult to swallow than 
other similar products.

September 2011. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and 
symptoms in patients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: 
•  Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
•  PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
•  PAH  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  Eisenmenger’s 
physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II. 
Stayveer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Informed consent application (Article 10c of Directive No 2001/83/EC) 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information together with a letter from 
Actelion Registration Ltd. allowing use to be made of relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical 
data of the original marketing authorisation for Tracleer.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Stayveer  has  been  submitted  by  Marklas 
Nederland  BV  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended. 
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (Actelion  Registration  Ltd)  for  Tracleer,  which  was 
authorised on 15 May 2002, provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical 
and clinical documentation of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent 
post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. 
As  a  consequence,  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  Stayveer  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date 
quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Tracleer. The application for Stayveer concerns only 
the  56  tablet  presentations  of  the  62.5  mg  and  125  mg strengths  approved  for  Tracleer  and 
consists only of Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Tracleer 
CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on 
the EMA website. 
The approved indication is: 
treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and 
symptoms in patients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: 
•  Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
•  PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
•  PAH  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  Eisenmenger’s 
physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II. 
Stayveer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Tracleer application, the quality data in 
support of the Stayveer application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Tracleer 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Tracleer application, the non-clinical data 
in support of the Stayveer application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the 
Tracleer dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing 
procedures. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The data provided related to the environmental risk assessment are considered acceptable.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no issues related to the non-clinical data, which 
have been assessed for Tracleer application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Tracleer application, the clinical data in 
support of the Stayveer application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Tracleer 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
Of  note,  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  bosentan  is  well  documented.  In  more  than  80  clinical 
studies  (43  clinical  pharmacology  Phase  1  studies,  39  Phases  2  to  4  studies,  including  pre-IBD 
studies),  3,400  patients  have  been  exposed  to  bosentan  including:  900  patients  in  pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) studies, 400 patients in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 1,100 patients 
in  congestive  heart  failure,  and  459  patients  in  digital  ulcer  (DU)  disease  associated  with 
systemic sclerosis (SSc). 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Summary of the Pharmacovigilance System  
The applicant submitted a signed Summary of the Pharmacovigilance System. Provided that the 
Pharmacovigilance System Master File fully complies with the new legal requirements as set out 
in  the  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  and  as  detailed  in  the  respective  GVP  module,  the 
CHMP considered the Summary of the Pharmacovigilance System acceptable.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed 
on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Tracleer. The bridging report submitted 
by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Since this application is an informed consent to Tracleer, and in view of the fact that the 
Stayveer application is identical to the up-to-date quality, efficacy and safety data of the 
Tracleer dossier, the CHMP considered that the benefit/risk balance for Stayveer is positive in 
the following indication : 
Treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and 
symptoms in patients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: 
•  Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
•  PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
•  PAH  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts  and  Eisenmenger’s 
physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II. 
Stayveer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Stayveer is not similar to Revatio, Volibris, and 
Ventavis within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
Derogation of market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 
141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the following derogation 
laid down in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation applies: 
the holder of the marketing authorisation for Tracleer has given his consent to the applicant. 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Stayveer  in  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial 
Stayveer  
EMA/294640/2013 
Page 13/16 
 
  
  
 
hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and  symptoms  in  patients  with  WHO 
functional  class  III  (some  improvements  have  also  been  seen  in  patients  with  WHO  class  II) 
and reduction of the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and on-
going  digital  ulcer  disease,  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends    the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2) 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
•

subsequent updates of the RMP. 
 An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•    At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
•    Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached. 
When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted 
at the same time. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
The MAH shall agree the details of a controlled distribution system with the National 
Competent Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that prior to 
prescribing all health care professionals who intend to prescribe and/or dispense Stayveer are

Update of the (SPC) sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 and corresponding 
sections  of  the  Package  leaflet  (PL).  The  application  is  based  on 
newly  completed  interaction  studies  and  on  two  adverse  events 
reported in the 4th efavirenz PSUR.  In addition, a class wording on 
St-John’s wort is added, as agreed with CPMP. 
Update  of  the  SPC  for  the  oral  solution  in  order  to  include 
information on  the final results  of study  DMP266-111, “A Phase I, 
Open-label, Single-dose, Randomized; Two-period Crossover Study

To amend sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC as requested by the CPMP 
on  July  2002,  following  the  assessment  of  PSUR  5,  in  order  to 
adequately  reflect  the  safety  concerns  with  regard  to  suicide.  In 
particular, 
the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  was 
requested to delete “occasional” in sections 4.4 and 4.8 and “a causal 
relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these 
reports” in sections 4.8. 
Moreover, the MAH took this opportunity to update the SPC and the 
PL  of  the  300mg  and  the  600mg  film-coated  tablet  presentations, 
following  variation  II/27  for  Sustiva,  adopted  at  the  June  2002 
CPMP for the hard capsules and the oral solution presentation. 
The  MAH  applied  for  an  update  of  the  SPC  to  include  the  class

use) and 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) of the SPC to implement 
the class labelling on liver impairment adopted by the CPMP for all 
anti-retroviral  medicinal  products  on  25  April  2003.  Furthermore, 
the  MAH  has  taken  this  opportunity  to  update  section  4.4  of  the 
SPC, by reordering the wording on lactose (for the 300 and 600 mg 
tablet  formulations  only),  on  cholesterol  and  on  lipodystrophy.  In 
addition,  the  MAH  has  proposed  to  update  the  PL  in  line  with  the 
proposed  changes  of  the  SPC  and  to  include  the  wording  on 
lipodystrophy as adopted by the CPMP on 24 March 2003.

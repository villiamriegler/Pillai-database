Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the SmPC have been updated to 
with oral contraceptives based on the final study 
results from the drug-drug interaction study (MS 
700568-0031). This is a randomized, double-blind, 
2-period, 2-sequence, crossover Phase I study with a 
reflect the results of the DDI study. Co-administration of 
cladribine with oral hormonal contraceptives 
(ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) showed no clinically 
relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with cladribine. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

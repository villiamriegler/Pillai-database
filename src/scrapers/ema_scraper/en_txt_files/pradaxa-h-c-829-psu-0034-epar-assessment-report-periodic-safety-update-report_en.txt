2.  PSUR Data  
03 April 2013 
11 April 2013 
2.1.  Introduction (executive summary) 
This  is  the  eighth  PSUR  for  dabigatran  etexilate  (DE).  The  report  updates  safety  information  on 
dabigatran  etexilate  given  as  mesilate  for  the  period  19  Mar  2012  to  18  Sep  2012.  Pradaxa  was 
authorized in the EU on 18 March 2008.  
Pradaxa is available as a hard hydroxypropylmethylcellulose capsule containing DE as active substance 
in  the  dose  strengths  75  mg,  110  mg  and  150  mg.  DE  is  the  oral  pro-drug  of  the  active  moiety 
dabigatran.  Dabigatran  is  a  potent,  synthetic,  non-peptide  competitive,  rapidly  acting  and  reversible 
inhibitor of thrombin. Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin 
during  the  coagulation  cascade,  its  inhibition  prevents  the  thrombus  development.  Dabigatran  also 
inhibits free thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
In the EU, the authorised indications for DE use are: 
• Primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective 
total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery 
• Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more of the following risk factors: 
o Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism 
o Left ventricular ejection fraction <40% 
o Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 2 
o Age ≥75 years 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 5/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o Age ≥65 years associated with one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery 
disease, or hypertension 
In addition, the substance is currently under investigation in the following indications: 
     • Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment 
     • Secondary prevention of VTE 
     •  Prevention  of  stroke,  systemic  embolism  and  valve  thrombosis  in  patients  with  mechanical         
heart valves (development discontinued end of 2012). 
During  the  update  period,  the  MAH  received  9238  case  reports  (7437  [healthcare-professional]  HP-
confirmed;  1801  non-HP-confirmed)  including  15  689  ADRs  (11  947  HP-confirmed;  3742  non-  HP-
confirmed). In addition, late-breaking information (19 Sep 2012 to 18 Oct 2012) on 1700 cases (1420 
HP-confirmed, 280 non-HP-confirmed) was considered. In general, the vast majority of ADRs received 
were assessed as already listed side effects for Pradaxa, reported terms describing the mode of action 
of Pradaxa or alternative explanations were reported.  
As expected, bleeding events were the most often reported ADRs. In 43.2% of all HP-confirmed cases 
received during the update period, at least one bleeding event or an event associated to bleeding was 
reported.  In  238  (7.4%)  of  the  cases  for  the  update  period,  bleeding  was  associated  with  fatal 
outcome.  The  percentage  of  bleeding  events  from  all  reported  events  (43.2%)  was  comparable  with 
that observed in the previous reporting period (44.5%). 
Furthermore,  in  the  current  PSUR  the  following  topics  were  investigated  without  giving  rise  to  new 
safety concerns: 
• Agranulocytosis/leucopenia 
• Myocardial infarction 
• Hepatotoxicity 
• Renal function 
• Haemorrhage  
The  current  PSUR  did  not  reveal  any  new  safety  issues  and  as  such  no  particular  issues  need  to  be 
addressed  except  routine  pharmacovigilance.  The  benefit-risk  balance  remains  positive  for  the 
authorised indications. 
Next PSUR 
Submission of next PSUR is planned within 70 days after the DLP of 18 Mar 2013.  
2.2.  Worldwide marketing authorisation status 
DE  was  first  authorised  in  all  member  states  of  the  European  Economic  Area  (EEA)  via  centralised 
procedure. The IBD for dabigatran etexilate is 18 Mar 2008.  
Dabigatran  etexilate  is  currently  authorised  and/or  marketed  in  96  countries  under  the  trade  names 
Pradaxa®,  Pradaxar®,  Pradax®  or  Prazaxa®.  On  07  Sep  2012  on  request  of  the  Canadian  Health 
Authority, BI changed the local trade name for Pradax® to Pradaxa® in Canada.

2.3.  Overview of exposure and safety data  
2.3.1.  Actions taken in the reporting interval for safety reasons 
During the update period, there were: 
• no marketing authorisation withdrawals, revocations or suspensions 
• no failures to obtain a marketing authorisation renewal 
• no restrictions on distribution 
• no clinical trial suspensions 
• no dosage modifications 
• no changes in target population or indications 
• no formulation changes 
• no urgent safety restrictions 
• no Dear Doctor Letters 
2.3.2.  Changes to reference safety information 
The  reference  safety  information  for  this  PSUR  valid  at  DLP  of  this  PSUR,  is  the  company  core  data 
sheet (CCDS)/ 0266 version 08, dated 03 Jul 2012. The current CCDS covers two indications and three 
dose  strengths  (75  mg,  110  mg  and  150  mg).  During  the  update  period,  the  following  updates  were 
made to the CCDS: 
CCDS 07 to CCDS 08 (03 July 2012) 
Side effects 
•  Addition of new side effects angioedema and anaphylactic reaction under the SOC 'Immune system 
disorders'. 
•  Change of side effect term traumatic haematoma into traumatic haemorrhage under the SOC 
'Injury, poisoning and procedural complications'. 
Meaningful differences between CCDS and SmPC: 
The SmPC variations implementing wording according to CCDS 0266 versions 5 and 7 were completed 
within the reporting period and did not result in meaningful differences to the CCDS. The CCDS 0266 
version  6  item  'Addition  of  data  from  drug/drug  interaction  study  dronedarone/dabigatran  etexilate 
(1160.112) and recommendation against co-medication of dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone' was 
implemented  in  the  SmPC  (EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0028)  in  the  form  of  a  contraindication  on  EMA 
request.  In  the  context  of  FUM  29  the  SmPC  and  package  leaflet  were  updated  with  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0031.  The  main  label  updates  introduced  by  this  variation  pertained  to  a  more 
precise  specification  and  clarification  of  already  approved  contraindications  and  to  the  section  on 
overdose,  to  which  information  on  bleeding  management  has  been  added.  As  the  updates  to  both 
sections  were  in  line  with  the  CCDS,  changes  to  the  CCDS  were  not  foreseen.  Approvals  of  the  EU 
variation applications pertaining to CCDS 05, CCDS 06 and CCDS 07 were obtained within the review 
period. Variation EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0043 pertaining to CCDS 08 was obtained on 21 January 2013.  
2.3.3.  Patient exposure  
The  patient  exposure  to  DE  during  the  update  period  as  per  BI's  standard  method  was  estimated  at 
417  449  patient-years.  During  the  update  period,  8  clinical  trials  and  7  observational  studies  were 
ongoing, exposing patients to DE. Two clinical trials were reported during the update period (1160.85; 
1160.88). A total of 17 558 subjects were treated in these trials and observational studies.

2.3.4.  Adverse reactions 
Frequently reported serious and non-serious adverse events 
A total of 9238 cases were received during the update period of this PSUR with a total of 15 689 ADRs. 
Of  these,  11  947  (76.1%)  were  HP-confirmed.  The  most  frequently  reported  HP  confirmed  ADRs 
related  to  the  SOCs  'gastrointestinal  disorders'  (3555  ADRs,  29.8%)  and  'nervous  system  disorders' 
(1257 ADRs, 10.5%). 
In  order  to  place  the  number  of  reported  ADRs  in  perspective  with  the  volume  of  marketed  goods, 
reporting  indices  (RIs)  were  calculated  per  MedDRA  SOC.  The  calculated  reporting  indices  from  the 
table do not represent exact incidences of ADRs. They can only be considered an estimate of reaction 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 8/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidences  and  may  be  used  to  compare  the  ADR  profile  across  different  PSURs.  Overall,  reporting 
indices  for  the  current  PSUR  reporting  decreased  with  respect  to  cumulative  (PSUR  1  to  6)  figures  in 
the  range  of  -29.1%  to  -84.1%  (except  for  the  SOC  'neoplasms  benign  &  malignant'  and  'social 
circumstances',  where  a  small  increase  of  8.9%  and  7.2%,  respectively,  was  observed).  Reporting 
indices also decreased for all SOCs when compared with the previous reporting period (PSUR 7) in the 
range  of  -6.3%  to  -78.3%,  except  for  the  SOC  'social  circumstances'  (increase  of  29.3%).  For  this 
SOC,  comparably  small  absolute  number  of  ADRs  (n=13)  were  received  in  the  update  period; 
therefore, minor changes of case counts already had an impact on the reporting index.

CASES WITH FATAL OUTCOME 
Of the 7437 HP-confirmed cases received during the update period, 590 were reported with fatal 
outcome. The number of fatal cases per MedDRA SOC is shown in the table below. 
Looking at treatment indications, the majority of cases with a fatal outcome concerned patients treated 
for  the  SPAF  indication  (n=386)  followed  by  primary  venous  thromboembolism  prevention  ([pVTEp] 
n=14).  Eleven  patients  were  treated  for  off-label  indications.  In  the  remaining  179  cases,  the 
indication  was  not  reported.  The  below  table  shows  primary  cause  of  death  in  all  patients  with  fatal 
outcome treated for SPAF:

Selected cases containing new or relevant safety information by SOC 
Agranulocytosis/leukopenia 
A  total  of  18  cases  were  received  during  the  update  period.  Of  these  8  were  serious  cases  reporting 
ADRs coding to the MedDRA PTs 'agranulocytosis' (n=5) and 'pancytopenia' (n=3). 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
The safety information received for this SOC was analysed regarding the topic 'hepatotoxicity'. 280 HP-
confirmed case reports were received fulfilling the SMQ criteria. 124 case reports described an isolated 
elevation of coagulation parameters, which is in line with the mode of action of Pradaxa.  In 58 cases 
originating  from  the  SMQ  search  isolated  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  were  reported.  This  event  is  an 
already listed adverse drug reaction of Pradaxa. In 15 case reports retrieved from the SMQ search for 
the reporting period of this PSUR the outcome was fatal. In 4 of these 15 cases, a hepatic event was 
reported  as  cause  of  death  or  as  contributory  factor.  In  conclusion,  the  safety  data  on  hepatobiliary 
events that came to the attention of the company during the update period of this PSUR did not reveal 
relevant new information concerning the safety profile of Pradaxa. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
A total of 10 fatal cases were reported for this SOC. Two hundred and twenty two cases of the total of 
386  cases  of  this  SOC  were  containing  haemorrhagic  events  (6  fatal).  The  most  frequently  reported 
haemorrhagic  event  of  this  SOC  was  haematuria  (88.3%,  N=196  and  urinary  bladder  haemorrhage 
(4.5%, N=10). 
Haemorrhage 
At  case  level,  a  total  of  7437  HP-confirmed  ADR  case  reports  were  received by  BI  during  the  update 
period. In 3214 (43.2%) of these cases, at least one bleeding event was reported, which is similar to 
the previous reporting period (44.5%, PSUR 7).  The haemorrhagic events  were distributed as follows 
to the various anatomical systems: gastrointestinal 47.1%; urogenital 10.4%; intracranial 8.1%; skin 
6.6%; wound 1.5%; other locations 15.1% and no location reported 11.3%. This is very similar to the 
last  update  period.  To  assess  the  effect  of  potential  drug  interactions  on  the  frequency  of  bleeding 
events,  the  occurrence  of  these  events  in  patients  concomitantly  treated  with  P-gp  inhibitors  and/or 
anticoagulants was evaluated for all cases received during the update period and shown in the below 
table. 
PSUR assessment report

Page 11/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A cumulative evaluation of all haemorrhagic events received from spontaneous reporting (spontaneous 
and  health  authority  cases)  since  first  launch  in  March  2008  was  performed  in  the  current  PSUR. 
Comparing reporting rates for serious and fatal bleeding events observed under market conditions, the 
following can be concluded: 
•  Generally,  reporting  rates  are  lower  than  what  would  be  expected  from  experience  of  the  RE-LY 
trial (incidence rates); under-reporting has to be considered. 
•  Monthly cumulative reporting rates for fatal bleeding were stable during the PSUR update period; 
for serious bleeding events there is a trend for a decrease of monthly cumulative reporting rates in 
the update period. 
• 
There  does  not  appear  to  be  a  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  patients  experiencing 
serious or fatal bleedings in terms of most patient characteristics. The percentage of patients ≥75 
years  of  age  may  be  slightly  higher  in  the  fatal  subgroup;  however,  it  needs  to  be  taken  into 
account  that  age  information  has  not  been  reported  for  36.3%  and  38.3%  of  serious  and  fatal 
bleeding cases respectively. 
•  Especially  for  the  comparison  of  the  patient  populations  with  fatal  bleeding  events  the 
interpretation of data is difficult due to often limited information on single case level and relatively 
low case numbers, so that only limited conclusions can be drawn from the data available. 
•  No new risk factors have been detected by thorough analysis of market data available so far. 
MAH response to question in previous PSUR 7 
PSUR Question 2 of 3: 
MAH  mentions  possible  underreporting  as  a general issue.  In  the  next  PSUR  MAH  is  asked  to  discuss 
whether  actions  should  be  taken  to  increase  awareness  and  reporting  of  ADR  for  Pradaxa.  The  MAh 
responded that the safety profile of Pradaxa was investigated in well controlled clinical trials and based 
on the results of these trials frequencies for side effects have been calculated and are provided in the 
EU  SmPC.  It  is  well  known  that  reporting  rates  of  adverse  drug  reactions  from  post  marketing 
experience are lower than reporting incidences calculated from well controlled clinical trials. However, 
spontaneous reporting rates might be influenced by published reports or programs which increase the 
public  awareness  of  a  product.  Compared  to  products  marketed  for  many  years  such  as  warfarin, 
which is also used in the SPAF indication, it is expected that the reporting rates for Pradaxa are higher. 
Reason for the higher reporting rate of adverse drug experiences observed in association with the use 
of  Pradaxa  compared  to  warfarin  is  the  introduction  of  a  new  therapeutic  principal  (oral  thrombin 
inhibitor)  into  the  market.  Heightened  awareness  is  further  stimulated  by  media  and  authority 
communications.  This  is  not  comparable  with  the  reporting  situation  of  warfarin  which  is  available  on 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate

the  market  for  more  than  five  decades.  The  MAH  has  established  educational  programs  for  treating 
physicians  including  tools  such  as  the  prescriber  guides  for  the  various  treatment  indications  and  the 
patient  alert  card.  Both  are  updated  and  distributed  whenever  new  information  becomes  available. 
Based on the above it is considered that no further actions to increase the awareness of Pradaxa and 
to improve the reporting of ADRs are necessary. 
Question  from  previous  PSUR  regarding  pericardial  effusion,  pericardial  hemorrhage  and 
cardiac tamponade. 
A  relatively  large  number  of  cases  of  pericardial  effusion,  pericardial  haemorrhage  and  cardiac 
tamponade  have  been  found  in  one  of  the  MSs  Pharmacovigilance  databases.  Several  cases  have 
alternative aetiologies (e.g. recent cardiac surgery/cardioversion) however there are also cases without 
clear  confounders.  The  SmPC  includes  mentioning  of  pericardial  bleeding  in  the  context  of  major 
bleeding, and it appears that the numbers of cases have increased more rapidly recently (since ~Nov 
2011) and therefore may be related to the new indication in AF and use in patients at greater risk. The 
MAH  is  requested  to  review  this  subject  with  a  view  to  identifying  any  additional  risk  factors,  and  to 
inclusion of these terms in the main table in section 4.8 of the SmPC if appropriate, given the potential 
severity of these events. 
MAH response 
In parallel to an increase in exposure, the MAH can confirm the observation of an increasing number of 
reports of 'Pericardial effusion', 'Pericardial hemorrhage' and 'Cardiac tamponade' from 2011. The MAH 
created  a  search  algorithm  comprised  of  the  MedDRA  PTs  'Pericardial  effusion',  'Pericardial 
hemorrhage'  and  'Cardiac  tamponade'  and  identified  117  individual  case  safety  reports  in  the  MAH's 
global  safety  database  from  beginning  of  operation  to  database  lock  point  on  23  Jul  2012.  37  of  the 
117  cases  reported  a  clearly  hemorrhagic  origin  of  the  event,  15  cases  reported  a  clearly  non-
hemorrhagic origin and for the remaining 65 cases, no origin was reported or could be identified from 
the provided information. 
Evaluation of the case series with effusions and tamponade of clearly hemorrhagic origin only: 
Conclusive alternative explanations were reported for 32 of the 37 events. For some of the cases, more 
than one plausible alternative explanation was reported. Remarkably for several cases, identified and 
listed contraindications have not been respected (e.g., severe renal impairment) or Pradaxa was used 
in  an  unapproved  indication  ('anticoagulation  in  catheter  ablation').  Especially  the  latter  potential 
clinical  use  is  being  investigated  for  safety  and  efficacy  in  the  DAPPAR-AF  (Dabigatran  for  Peri 
Procedural Anticoagulation during Radiofrequency Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation) study by Allan Skanes 
(BI-study ID: 1160.125; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01468155). 
Evaluation of the case series with effusions and tamponade of clearly hemorrhagic and unknown origin: 
This case series comprises 102 cases of effusions / tamponade of clearly non-hemorrhagic (N= 37) and 
unknown (N= 65) origin. 61 of 102 cases are considered to report conclusive alternative explanations 
for the occurrence of the  selected events. Some reports contain more than 1 alternative explanation. 
In a total of 38 of these 61 cases, the events were reported together with invasive cardiac procedures. 
No  alternative  explanation  was  reported  in  41  cases.  In  35  of  these,  a  causal  association  was 
considered  'not  fully  assessable'  because  of  missing  essential  information  with  regards  to  temporal 
sequence of events or concomitant diseases / medication. 
Evaluation  of  the  case  series  with  effusions  and  tamponade  of  clearly  nonhemorrhagic  and  unknown 
origin: 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 13/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This case series comprises 80 cases of effusions / tamponade of clearly non-hemorrhagic (N= 15) and 
unknown (N= 65) origin. In 40 cases (27 of these with a total daily dose of 300 mg), 'Atrial fibrillation' 
or  equal  terms  were  reported  as  indication.  For  all  cases  with  dosing  information  available, 
predominantly 300 mg total daily dose was reported (33 of 80). The MAH considers the observation of 
an increased number of spontaneous reports as indicator of the increasing clinical use of Pradaxa in a 
per-se more vulnerable patient population with regards to cardiac events after market authorization for 
'stroke  prevention  in  patients  with  non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation'.  The  increasing  number  of  reports 
from clinical trials in 2012 however, is reflecting the current phase II development program RE-ALIGN 
(A  Randomized,  Phase  II  Study  to  Evaluate  the  sAfety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  oraL  dabIGatran 
Etexilate  in  Patients  after  Heart  Valve  replacemeNt;  Study-ID:  1160-113),  which  started  in  October 
2011. All clinical trials cases in 2012 were reported from this single open-label study. 
Evaluation of the clinical study database RE-ALIGN: 
Exposing  a  particularly  vulnerable  patient  population,  the  MAH  evaluated  the  clinical  database  of  the 
ongoing  RE-ALIGN  study  (Study-ID:  1160.113:  A  Prospective,  Randomised,  Open  label,  Blinded 
Endpoint  phase  II  study  to  Evaluate  the  sAfety  of  oraL  dabIGatran  etexilate  in  patients  after  heart 
valve  replacemeNt)  for  case  reports  of  the  selected  PTs.  A  total  of  28  cases  could  be  identified  with 
date  of  05th  Oct,  2012.  On  a  PT  level,  “pericardial  effusion”  was  reported  in  19  cases,  “pericardial 
hemorrhage”  in  8  cases,  and  “cardiac  tamponade”  was  reported once.  18  cases  were  reported in  the 
dabigatran treatment arms, 8 cases in the active control arm with warfarin and 2 cases were reported 
for patients in screening phase, who were not randomized and thus, not exposed to study drug. 
Overall conclusion by MAH 
The  sequential  evaluation  of  the  initial  case  series  derived  from  the  MAH’s  safety  database  was 
considered  appropriate  to  account  for  the  different  risk  factors  and  pathophysiological  mechanism  of 
serous and hemorrhagic pericardial effusions / tamponades. Due to the large number of spontaneous 
reports in the entire case series as well as in all subgroups, the data quality was generally limited or 
even  poor.  Several  cases  could  not  be  assessed  with  regards  to  causal  association;  some  could  not 
even be assessed for a temporal sequence of drug administration and onset of the respective event. In 
several cases, Pradaxa may well have contributed to the extent of the – most frequently hemorrhagic 
effusion  /  tamponade.  In  the  majority  of  these  cases,  the  common  pattern  was  identifiable  that  an 
invasive  cardiac  procedure  was  reportedly  or  at  least  highly  likely  responsible  to  have  set  the  initial 
lesion.  Effective  anticoagulation  in  this  situation  is  well  able  to  increase  the  extent  of  bleeding 
regardless  of  the  anticoagulant  used.  The  above  mentioned  patient  populations  and  risk  factors 
however,  have  already  been  identified  and  are  reflected  in  the  appropriate  section  of  the  SmPC.  In 
addition,  a  prescriber's  guide  has  been  distributed.  'Hemorrhage'  is  also  a  major  topic  in  the  Risk 
Management  Plan.  In  addition  to  this,  the  MAH  cannot  identify  previously  unrecognized  risk  factors, 
neither for the subgroup of serous nor for hemorrhagic effusions / tamponades in the post-marketing 
data.  The  MAH  considers  the  increase  in  reports  seen  from  2011  onwards  as  consequence  of  the 
increasing clinical use of Pradaxa in a patient population that is per-se at greater risk for cardiac events 
due to the underlying disease, atrial fibrillation. 
2.3.5.  Studies 
Newly analysed studies 
During the update period, the following studies containing important safety information were analyzed: 
Phase IV trial 1160.85 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested that a post-approval study be conducted as a follow-
PSUR assessment report

up measure (FUM011) to evaluate the risk of bleeding in the more general population of patients with 
an  increased  risk  of  bleeding.  Study  1160.85  was  conducted  to  address  this  issue.  The  aims  were  to 
assess the safety (major bleeding events [MBEs]) and efficacy (symptomatic venous thromboembolism 
[VTE]) of DE 220 mg once daily, in accordance with the European product label in defined subgroups of 
patients from the general population (with potentially an increased risk) who were undergoing elective 
total  hip  replacement  (THR)  surgery  or  elective  total  knee  replacement  (TKR)  surgery  in  a  routine 
clinical setting. 
Summary: DE administered to patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery in accordance with 
the current European label, in a routine clinical setting, was safe and well tolerated. The pattern of AE 
reporting was similar to that observed in the corresponding phase III studies (RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, 
RE-NOVATE  II).  However,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  (which  included  bleeding 
events  and  efficacy  outcome  events),  drug-related  AEs,  and  SAEs  was  lower.  The  incidences  of  any 
bleeding events were also lower. 
Phase I trial 1160.88: 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  DE  administered  twice  daily  for  three  consecutive 
days (total 6 doses) were assessed in nine stable adolescents (12 to <18 years). 
Phase IIIb trial 1160.71: 
This study is a rollover trial from RE-LY, in which subjects treated with DE were allowed to continue the 
double-blind dose to which they had been randomised. In the RELY-ABLE study period, the annualised 
event  rate  of  subjects  with  stroke/SEE  was  numerically  higher  for  DE  110  (1.60%)  compared  to  DE 
150 (1.46%). The hazard ratio for stroke/SEE for DE110 vs. DE150 was 1.10 with a 95% CI of 0.83-
1.46. All categories of bleeding generally occurred more frequently in the DE 150 group compared to 
the DE 110 group. The risk of major bleeds was significantly lower for DE 110 treatment [0.79, 95% CI 
(0.65, 0.96) p=0.0168]. Annualised rates were 2.99% and 3.74% for the DE110 and DE 150. 
Phase II trial 1160.113: 
The  majority  of  patients  included  in  this  PK  interim  snapshot  belonged  to  the  “recent  surgery  group” 
(Population A). The main finding of this preliminary analysis was that a higher number of patients than 
initially predicted presented with dabigatran trough levels below the predefined target of 50 ng/mL. It 
appeared  that  higher  dosages  of  dabigatran  etexilate  may  be  required  in  the  early  post-operative 
period  to  achieve  an  exposure  comparable  to  chronic  treatment  remote  from  surgery.  The  exact 
reasons for these findings are not yet fully understood.

2.3.6.  Other information 
Efficacy-related information 
The search with the MedDRA SMQ 'Lack of efficacy/ effect' identified 53 case reports and the MedDRA 
SMQ 'Embolic and thrombotic events' identified 860 case reports. 33 cases were found in both SMQs, 
so  that  in  total  880  case  reports  were  included  in  the  evaluation.  In  114  (13.0%)  of  these,  a  fatal 
outcome on case level was reported.

MAH response to question in previous PSUR 7: 
PSUR Question 1 of 3: 
Treatment with Pradaxa prior to planned DC-cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillations is common 
in  clinical  practice.  MAH  is  in  the  next  PSUR  asked  to  comment  upon  this  approach.  Are  there  any 
studies documenting the efficacy of this approach? Any safety concerns? How long after DS conversion 
should treatment be given? 
MAH response: 
In  the  RELY  study  cardioversion  on  randomied  treatment  was  permitted.  Precardioversion 
transoesophageal  echocardiography  was  encouraged.  Data  from  before,  during  and  30  days  after 
cardioversion  were  analysed  and  are  meanwhile  published  (Nagarakanti  et  al  2011;  P  11-00277).  In 
total, 1983 cardioversions were performed in 1270 patients: 647, 672 and 664 in the De 110, DE 150 
and  warfarin  groups,  respectively.  For  D110,  D150,  and  warfarin,  transesophageal  echocardiography 
was performed before 25.5%, 24.1%, and 13.3% of cardioversions, of which  1.8%, 1.2%, and 1.1% 
were  positive  for  left  atrial  thrombi.  Continuous  treatment  with  study  drug  for  >3  weeks  before 
cardioversion was lower in D110 (76.4%) and D150 (79.2%) compared with warfarin (85.5%; P<0.01 
for both). Stroke and systemic embolism rates at 30 days were 0.8%, 0.3%, and 0.6% (D110 versus 
warfarin,  P=0.71;  D150  versus  warfarin,  P=0.40)  and  similar  in  patients  withand  without

transesophageal  echocardiography.  Major  bleeding  rates  were  1.7%,  0.6%,  and  0.6%  (D110  versus 
warfarin,  P=0.06; D150 versus warfarin, P=0.99).  In conclusion, the frequencies of stroke and major 
bleeding  within  30  days  of  cardioversion  on  the  2  doses  of  dabigatran  were  low  and  comparable  to 
those  on  warfarin  with  or  without  transesophageal  echocardiography  guidance.  These  data  were 
acknowledged in the registration process and the current label for Pradaxa states the following:

largest  cardioversion  database  including  the  fact  of  the  evaluation  of  DE  as  first  novel  oral 
anticoagulant in this setting. The updated ESC clinical practice guidelines from 2012 therefore state as 
follows: 
• 
For  patients  with  AF  of  48  hour  duration,  or  when  the  duration  of  AF  is  unknown,  OAC  therapy 
(e.g. VKA with INR 2–3 or dabigatran) is recommended for 3 weeks prior to and for 4 weeks after 
cardioversion, regardless of the method (electrical or oral/i.v. pharmacological) 
• 
In patients with risk factors for stroke or AF recurrence, OAC therapy, whether with dose-adjusted 
VKA (INR 2–3) or a NOAC, should be continued lifelong irrespective of the apparent maintenance 
of sinus rhythm following cardioversion 
2.3.7.  Late-breaking information 
Late-breaking information (19 Sep 2012 to 18 Oct 2012) on 1700 cases (1420 HP-confirmed, 280 non-
HP-confirmed) was considered. No information affecting the overall assessments provided in this PSUR 
was identified.  
2.3.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The  EU  Risk  Management  Plan  (EU-RMP)  Pradaxa  is  being  updated  and  will  be  submitted  to  the 
relevant  regulatory  authorities  without  undue  delay  (version  25).  The  currently  approved  version  is 
version 23, dated 28 Mar 2012. The RMP was assessed in the separate AR. 
2.3.9.  Overall safety evaluation 
Drug interactions 
A total of 44 cases were received, 31 serious including 7 fatal cases. Of the 44; 31 cases (70.4%) were 
reported  as  serious  and  13  (-29.5 %)  cases  were  reported  as  non  serious.  In  one  of  the  fatal  cases, 
patient died due to stroke (Phenprocoumon/Pradaxa, overlapping with low-molecular-weight heparin). 
In the other 6 cases, the interaction was reported as responsible for a fatal bleeding event. In these 6 
patients, the drug combination with Pradaxa was: Aspirin (2), unspecified NSAID (1), Clopidogrel and 
aspirin  (1),  Dronedarone  (1)  and  Erythromycin  (1).  The  majority  (4)  of  the  bleeding  cases  may  not 
describe  a  true  interaction  but  rather  side  effects  that  are  known  for  both  drugs.  Of  the  44  cases,  a 
total of 19 (43.1%) non-fatal serious cases involved bleeding events. A summary of drugs suspected 
for drug interaction with Pradaxa for cases with bleeding events is provided in the below table.

Overdose 
A total of 55 cases (including 5 non-HP confirmed cases) involving overdose were received during the 
reporting period. Overall, the pattern of reported events in cases concerning overdose does not provide 
grounds to amend the CCDS. 
Drug abuse or misuse 
Six  cases  (4  HP-confirmed,  2  non-HP-confirmed)  that  involved  abuse  or  misuse  of  Pradaxa  were 
received during the reporting period. One case of intentional overdose in suicidal intention is described, 
also involving other drugs. The remaining case reports concern wrong dosages or dosage regimens and 
rather constitute off-label use or compliance problems. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Only one case  has been reported in the current PSUR period. It was reported that at gestational week 
37, the patient delivered a healthy female baby weighing 2.570 Kg. No events were reported. 
Special patient groups 
Use in children 
A total of 2 cases (both HP-confirmed) of Pradaxa use in children (age below 18 years) were received 
during the reporting period. In both cases age is uncertain, and especially describing a 7 year old male 
patient  with  concomitant  medication  including  amlodipine,  aspirin,  bisoprolol,  flucloxacillin,  gliclazide, 
lisinopril,  metformin,  metronidazole  and  simvastatin  strongly  suggest  that  that  a  reporting  error  has

been the case. 
Off label use 
Information  on  indication  was  available  for  4401  HP-confirmed  cases  (59.2%  of  all  HP-confirmed 
cases); in total 4991 indication terms were reported. In 51 (1.0%) of the 4991 indication terms, off-
label use indications were reported. The frequency of reported off-label use in the current PSUR period 
is low and similar to the frequency observed in the previous PSUR 7, where off-label use was reported 
in 1.4%. 
Effects of long term treatment 
The  available  data  from  clinical  trials  and  post  marketing  experience  regarding  long-term  treatment 
with Pradaxa® show a similar safety profile compared to short-term treatment. Overall, the effects of 
long-term  treatment  observed  so  far,  do  not  provide  grounds  to  amend  the  reference  safety 
information. 
MAH response to question in previous PSUR 7 
Question 3 of 3: 
Are there any plans of long-term follow-up on the patients in the RE-LY trial? This could be extremely 
important for many of the safety issues raised. The MAH is requested to comments on this in the next 
PSUR. 
MAH Response: 
The RELY-ABLE study which is the follow up trial of RE-LY has included > 5800 patients. Patients were 
eligible if they completed RE-LY still receiving double-blind DE. Enrolled patients continued to receive 
the  same  double-blind  dabigatran  dose  in  RELY-ABLE.  The  primary  outcomes  are  the  occurrence  of 
major  ischemic  and  haemorrhagic  outcomes  as  well  as  death  and  net  clinical  benefit.  An  interims 
analysis has been completed and is described in more detail in PSUR 8. In summary, the overall goal of 
RELY-ABLE  was  to  provide  further  description  of  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  two  doses  of 
dabigatran 110 and 150 mg twice daily in patients completing RE-LY still receiving dabigatran. Patients 
were  eligible  for  RELY-ABLE  if  they  were  participating  in  RE-LY,  randomized  to  double-blinded 
dabigatran  study  medication  and  not  permanently  discontinued  from  study  medication  at  the  time  of 
the final RE-LY study visit. There were 5851 patients studied. Mean follow up was 4.25 years. During 
RELY-ABLE,  rates  of  stroke  or  systemic  embolism  were  1.60  and  1.46  %/year  on  dabigatran  110mg 
and 150 mg bid, respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-1.20). Rates 
of  major  hemorrhage  were  2.99  and  3.74%/year  on  dabigatran  110  and  150  mg  (HR  1.26,  95%  CI, 
1.04-1.53).  Rates  of  total  death  were  3.10  and  3.0  %/year  (HR  0.97;  95%  CI0.94-1.22).  Rates  of 
hemorrhagic  stroke  were very  low;  0.14  and  0.13%/year.  Rates  of  stroke,  major  bleeding  and  death 
on dabigatran during RELY-ABLE were similar to rates in RE-LY; relative effects of the two dabigatran 
doses on these outcomes were also consistent with RE-LY. 
2.4.  Modifications to the contraindications and the drug-drug interaction 
profile of DE (sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). 
Within  the  PSUR  procedure  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  below  issues  and  to  modify  the 
SmPC accordingly: 
a) Section 4.3, contraindications relating to lesions or conditions at 
significant risk of major bleeding 
Requested changes (additions in bold; deletions in strikeout) 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 19/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
• 
Lesion or condition, if considered a at significant risk factor forof major bleeding. This may 
include such as current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high 
risk  of  bleeding,  recent  brain  or  spinal  injury,  recent  brain,  spinal  or  ophthalmic  surgery,  recent 
intracranial  haemorrhage,  known  or  suspected  oesophageal  varices,  arteriovenous  malformations, 
vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities 
Rationale for requested change 
It has been suggested that the contraindication now in place for Pradaxa and other oral anticoagulants 
are  too  strict,  especially  with  regard  to  the  prevention  of  VTE  in  surgery  indications  where,  for 
example, an AV malformation or an aneurysm should not necessarily exclude a patient from receiving 
one  of  the  new  anticoagulants.  This  concern  is  acknowledged.  Therefore,  it  is  requested  that  the 
contraindication about lesions and conditions is revised slightly allowing the prescribing physician some 
more  room  for  clinical  judgment  on  when  to  consider  the  listed  lesions  and  conditions  as  absolute 
contraindications. 
MAH response 
The PRAC comment is acknowledged and the MAH agrees to the suggested changes. 
PRAC comment 
The MAH has accepted the requested changes and the PRAC considered the issue as resolved (see 
Annex I to this AR). 
b) Section 4.5, drug-drug interactions, posaconazole 
The MAH was asked to discuss and consider downgrading concomitant treatment with posaconazole 
from a non-recommendation to a caution. 
Rationale for request 
No  DDI  studies  have  been  conducted.  There  is  conflicting  information,  but  it  is  agreed  that 
posaconazole  is  not  as  strong  a  P-gp  inhibitor  as  ketoconazole.  Posaconazole  is  a  strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitor, but this is not relevant for Pradaxa. Considering the lack of robust in vitro and in vivo data, a 
non-recommendation (current wording) or even a caution for Pradaxa may be appropriate. 
MAH response 
The CHMP and PRAC comment is acknowledged and the MAH agrees to downgrade posaconazole from 
the  current  “non-recommendation”  to  a  cautionary  statement.  The  following  wording  (in  bold)  is 
suggested for Annex I section 4.5 ‘(see also response to Question 2 d): 
Neither  clinical  nor  in  vitro  test  results  are  available  for  posaconazole  which  is  not  recommended  for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa. 
The  following  P-gp  inhibitors  have  not  been  studied:  Posaconazole  and  tacrolimus.  Both  medicinal 
products are only weak P-gp inhibitors and not expected to interact in a clinically meaningful manner. 
Nevertheless, close clinical surveillance is recommended. 
PRAC comment 
The MAH has not provided any discussion on whether a caution or non-recommendation is warranted. 
A brief summary of the available data on the P-gp inhibitory potential of posaconazole and a discussion 
PSUR assessment report

of its implications for Pradaxa should be provided. The issue  was considered not resolved and will be 
further assessed within procedure LEG2 12.1 after finalisation of this PSUR. 
c) Section 4.5, drug-drug interactions, voriconazole 
Request 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  interaction  potential  with  voriconazole  and  insert  a  non-
recommendation or a caution in the SmPC. 
Rationale for request 
No  DDI  studies  have  been  conducted.  There  is  conflicting  information,  but  it  is  agreed  that 
voriconazole  is  a  P-gp  inhibitor,  but  not  as  strong  as  ketoconazole.  Voriconazole  is  a  strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitor, but this is not relevant for Pradaxa. Considering the lack of robust in vitro and in vivo data, a 
non-recommendation or a caution for Pradaxa may be appropriate. 
MAH response 
Voriconazole has not been reported to be a strong P-gp inhibitor. In contrast, in a clinical trial with the 
prototypic  P-gp  substrate  digoxin,  voriconazole  comedication  did  not  affect  the  PK  of  digoxin  [R13-
0765]. In this study, the ratios for Cmax and AUC were reported as 109.8% [90% confidence interval 
(CI) 97.1, 124.1] and 100.5% [90% CI 91.4, 110.5], respectively. This information is also reflected in 
the  interaction  table  (page  13)  of  the  VFEND  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  Further,  in  the 
recent  FDA  Draft  Guidance  for  Industry  "Drug  Interaction  Studies-  Study  Design,  Data  Analysis, 
Implications  for  Dosing,  and  Labeling  Recommendations",  voriconazole  is  listed  as  a  strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitor  and  a  Non-P-gp  Inhibitor  (Table  8).  In  summary,  voriconazole  is  not  a  P-gp  inhibitor  and 
therefore  the  interaction  potential  with  dabigatran  etexilate  is  considered  very  low.  A  non-
recommendation or a caution for Pradaxa seems not justified.

Purkins,  L.;  Wood,  N.;  Kleinermans,  D.;  Nichols,  D.  Voriconazole  does  not  affect  the 
steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2003, 56 (Suppl. 1), 45–50) 
PRAC comment 
The  MAH  has  provided  documentation  that  voriconazole  is  unlikely  to  be  a  P-gp  inhibitor  of  a 
significance  that  would  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of  dabigatran  etexilate  to  a  clinically  relevant 
degree. Hence, there appears to be no need to include a caution or a non-recommendation. The issue 
was considered resolved. 
d) Section 4.5, drug-drug interactions, tacrolimus 
Request 
The MAH is asked to discuss and consider downgrading concomitant treatment with tacrolimus from a 
contraindication to a non-recommendation or a caution. 
Rationale for request 
No DDI studies have been conducted. There is conflicting information, but it is agreed that tacrolimus 
is  not  as  strong  a  P-gp  inhibitor  as  ketoconazole.  For  Pradaxa  a  contraindication  appears  too 
restrictive, and a non-recommendation or even a caution may be more appropriate. 
MAH response

The PRAC comment are acknowledged and the MAH agrees to downgrade tacrolimus from the current 
contraindication to a cautionary statement. The following changes (shown below in bold) are suggested 
for Annex I sections 4.3 and 4.5 ‘(see also response to Question 2 b): 
Section 4.3 Contraindications 
•  
Concomitant treatment with systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tacrolimus and 
dronedarone (see section 4.5) 
Section 4.5 Interaction 
Systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tacrolimus and dronedarone are contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised with other strong P-gp inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, 
quinidine or verapamil) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
[…] 
The following potent P-gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect as with ketoconazole may be expected: 
Itraconazole, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which are contra-indicated (see section 4.3). 
[…] 
The following P-gp inhibitors have not been studied: Posaconazole, tacrolimus. Both 
medicinal products are only weak P-gp inhibitors and not expected to interact in a clinically 
meaningful manner. Nevertheless, close clinical surveillance is recommended. 
PRAC comment 
The MAH has not provided any discussion on whether a caution or non-recommendation is warranted 
or whether the current contraindication should be kept. A brief summary of the available data on the P-
gp inhibitory potential of tacrolimus and a discussion of its implications for Pradaxa should be provided. 
The issue was considered not resolved and will be further assessed within procedure LEG2 12.1 after 
finalisation of this PSUR.  
e) Section 4.2 and 4.5, posology and drug-drug interactions, amiodarone 
Request 
Taking into account all available data, the MAH is asked to discuss the appropriateness of the current 
recommended  dose  reduction  for  the  pVTE  indications  in  patients  treated  concomitantly  with 
amiodarone. 
Rationale for request 
In light of the modest increase in dabigatran exposure with amiodarone and the fact that amiodarone 
treatment  is  not  in  itself  reason  for  dose  reduction  in  the  SPAF  indication,  the  current  recommended 
dose reduction for Pradaxa in the pVTE indications could be challenged.  
MAH response 
With the responses to the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues during the registration process for pVTEp 
in 2007 the MAH agreed to a dose adjustment of dabigatran when co-treated with amiodarone. Since 
then,  no  additional  meaningful  data  were  further  generated  which  would  justify  a  dose  increase.  The 
RENOVATE  II  study  (1160.64,  U10-1392-01  submitted  with  eCTD  sequence  0005)  which  was 
completed after first registration did only investigate a daily dose of 220 mg/day and therefore had to 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 22/32 
 
 
 
 
exclude  patients  on  co-treatment  with  amiodarone.  The  FUM  trial  1160.85  (U12-1556-01,  submitted 
with eCTD sequence 0085) which was recently completed only included a very low number of patients 
with concomitant therapy of P-gp inhibitors; there were only 3 patients with concomitant treatment of 
amiodarone, so no firm conclusions can be drawn. The postmarketing surveillance data do not reliably 
allow  a  differentation  between  the  two  registered  indications  to  assess  bleed  rates  with  or  without 
amiodarone for pVTEp. Moreover, based on postmarketing experience those data are highly dominated 
by AE reports coming from the SPAF indication. As patient population and clinical setting for pVTEp and 
SPAF are different incl. a wound healing process in case of pVTEp a dose increase is not justifyable by 
the MAH. 
PRAC comment 
No significant new information is available to justify a change in the current dose recommendations for 
the  pVTE  indications  when  co-treating  with  amiodarone.  The  company  response  is  acceptable.  Issue 
resolved. 
f) Section 4.2 and 4.5, posology and drug-drug interactions, quinidine 
Request 
Taking into account all available data, the MAH is asked to discuss the appropriateness of the current 
recommended dose reduction for the pVTE indications in patients treated concomitantly with quinidine. 
Rationale for request 
In  light  of  the  modest  increase  in  dabigatran  exposure  with  quinidine  and  the  fact  that  quinidine 
treatment  is  not  in  itself  reason  for  dose  reduction  in  the  SPAF  indication,  the  current  recommended 
dose reduction for Pradaxa in the pVTE indications could be challenged. 
MAH response 
During  the  registration  process  for  pVTEp  in  2007  a  contraindication  for  dabigatran  when  cotreated 
with quinidine was agreed in the frame of the CHMP opinion. After trial 1160.90 which was submitted 
via  type  II  variation  EMA/H/C/000829/II/0016  (eCTD  sequence  0011)  this  quinidine  contraindication 
was changed to a dose adjustment. Since then, no additional meaningful data were further generated 
which  would  justify  a  dose  increase  of  dabigatran  for  co-treatment  with  quinidine  in  pVTEp.  The 
RENOVATE  II  study  (1160.64,  U10-1392-01  submitted  with  eCTD  sequence  0005)  which  was 
completed after first registration had to exclude patients on co-treatment with quinidine. The FUM trial 
1160.85  (U12-1556-01,  submitted  with  eCTD  sequence  0085)  which  was  recently  completed  only 
included  a  very  low  number  of  patients  with  concomitant  therapy  of  P-gp  inhibitors;  none  of  the 
patients  received  co-treatment  with  quinidine,  so  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  As  patient 
population and clinical setting for pVTEp and SPAF are different incl. a wound healing process in case of 
pVTEp a dose increase is not justifyable by the MAH. 
PRAC comment 
No significant new information is available to justify a change in the current dose recommendations for 
the  pVTE  indications  when  co-treating  with  quinidine.  The  company  response  is  acceptable.  Issue 
resolved. 
g) Section 4.5, drug-drug interactions, clarithromycin 
Request 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 23/32 
 
 
 
 
The MAH is asked to discuss and consider removing the caution regarding concomitant treatment with 
clarithromycin. 
Rationale for request 
A 1.2-fold increase in dabigatran exposure may be considered too insignificant to warrant a caution. 
MAH response 
With the responses to the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues during the registration process for pVTEp 
in  2007  the  MAH  agreed  to  include  a  cautionary  statement  for  co-treatment  with  clarithromycin. 
Furthermore,  with  the  Letter  of  Undertaking  dated  22  Jan  2008  the  MAH  agreed  to  conduct  “A  drug 
drug interaction study with steady state concentrations of a specific P-gp inhibitor (clarithromycin)” as 
a Follow-up measure (FUM006). Upon assessment of the study report, the CHMP asked for rephrasing 
of  the  SmPC,  which  was  handled  in  the  frame  of  type  II  variation  EMA/H/C/000829/II/0011.  Since 
then,  no  new  clinical  meaningful  data  were  generated  which  would  allow  the  MAH  to  remove  this 
caution.  The  FUM  trial  1160.85  (U12-1556-01,  submitted  with  eCTD  sequence  0085)  which  was 
recently  completed  only  included  a  very  low  number  of  patients  with  concomitant  therapy  of  P-gp 
inhibitors not allowing firm conclusions. 
PRAC comment 
No new clinical data is available. Even if a 1.2-fold increase in dabigatran exposure may be considered 
insignificant, the company prefers to maintain the caution. This is acceptable. Issue resolved. 
2.5.  Conclusions of the MAH 
During  the  update  period,  the  MAH  received  9238  case  reports  (7437  HP-confirmed;  1801  non-HP-
confirmed) including 15 689 ADRs (11 947 HP-confirmed; 3742 non- HP-confirmed). In addition, late-
breaking information (19 Sep 2012 to 18 Oct 2012) on 1700 cases (1420 HP-confirmed, 280 non-HP-
confirmed)  was  considered.  In  general,  the  vast  majority  of  ADRs  received were  assessed  as  already 
listed side effects for Pradaxa, reported terms describing the mode of action of Pradaxa or alternative 
explanations  were  reported.  As  expected,  bleeding  events  were  the  most  often  reported  ADRs.  In 
43.2% of all HP-confirmed cases received during the update period, at least one bleeding event or an 
event associated to bleeding was reported. In 238 (7.4%) of the cases for the update period, bleeding 
was  associated  with  fatal  outcome.  The  percentage  of  bleeding  events  from  all  reported  events 
(43.2%) was comparable with that observed in the previous reporting period (44.5%). The pattern of 
bleeding  ADRs  evaluated  in  patients  treated  in  the  granted  indications  is  similar  to  that  known  from 
well-controlled  clinical  trials  and  past  PSURs.  The  cumulative  review  of  all  haemorrhagic  case  reports 
allows to conclude that reporting rates of spontaneous data are lower than it would be expected from 
experience of the RE-LY trial; under-reporting needs to be considered. No new risk factors have been 
detected  by  thorough  analysis  of  market  data  available.  During  the  reporting  period,  cumulative 
reporting  rates  for  serious  bleeding  events  have  slightly  decreased  from  56.2  events  per  10  000 
patient years (February 2012) to 51.5 events per 10 000 patient-years (August 2012). The reporting 
rate  for  fatal  bleeding  events  remained  stable  with  7.3  events  per  10  000  patient-years  (February 
2012)  and  7.3  events  per  10  000  patient-years  (August  2012).  The  information  received  during  the 
reporting  period  concerning  the  monitoring  topics  'hepatotoxicity'  and  'myocardial  infarction'  did  not 
reveal  any  new  relevant  medical  safety  information.  The  number  of  case  reports  received  for  these 
topics is considered to be low. The evaluation of events associated with renal impairment did not result 
in  any  change  of  the  assessment  provided  in  the  last  PSUR  7.  However  the  MAH  will  continue  to 
monitor this topic.

2.6.  Discussion and conclusions on the PSUR data  
During  the  period  under  review  the  SmPC  was  updated  with  a  contraindication  recommendation 
against  co-medication  of  Pradaxa  and  dronedarone  (EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0028).  In  addition,  the 
SmPC  and  package  leaflet  were  updated  with  more  precise  specifications  and  clarification  of  already 
approved  contraindications  (EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0031).  Furthermore,  the  section  overdose  was 
likewise  updated  with  information  on  bleeding  management  (also  EMEA/H/C/000829/II/0031).  Based 
on a review of the safety data related to the RE-ALIGN study, the SmPC section 4.3 has been updated 
with  the  following  contraindication:  Prosthetic  heart  valves  replacement  requiring  anticoagulant 
treatment (EMEA/H/C/829/II/44) 
During the current PSUR 8 period the market exposure for Pradaxa was 417 449 patient years. During 
the  update  period,  the  MAH  received  9238  case  reports  with  a  total  of  15  689  ADRs.  The  far  most 
frequent ADR was haemorrhagic events with a total of 7437 HP-confirmed ADR case reports during the 
update  period.  In  3214  (43.2%)  of  these  cases,  at  least  one  bleeding  event  was  reported,  which  is 
similar to the previous reporting period (44.5%, PSUR 7). In contrast to warfarin treatment no specific 
antidote exists for Pradaxa. However, an antibody is under development.  
Overall, reporting indices for the current PSUR reporting decreased with respect to cumulative (PSUR 1 
to  6)  figures  in  the  range  of  -29.1%  to  -84.1%  (except  for  the  SOC  'neoplasms  benign  &  malignant' 
and  'social  circumstances',  where  a  small  increase  of  8.9%  and  7.2%,  respectively,  was  observed). 
Reporting  indices  also  decreased  for  almost  all  SOCs  when  compared  with  the  previous  reporting 
period (PSUR 7) in the range of -6.3% to -78.3%. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  information  received  during  the  reporting  period  concerning  the  monitoring 
topics  'hepatotoxicity'  and  'myocardial  infarction'  did  not  reveal  any  new  relevant  medical  safety 
information. The number of case reports received for these topics was considered to be low. However, 
as mentioned in the RMP assessment the cumulative reporting rate for myocardial infarction is 3.1 per 
10  000  patient-years,  in  the  previous  PSUR  period  the  reporting  rate  was  2.6  events  per  10  000 
patient-years  (stated  in  the  previously  submitted  RMP  with  the  previous  PSUR  period).  The  MAH 
provided  response  and  it  was  assessed  within  updated  RMP  AR.  The  evaluation  of  events  associated 
with  renal  impairment  did  not  result  in  any  change  of  the  assessment  provided  in  the  last  PSUR  7. 
However the company will continue to monitor this topic. 
No new safety issues were detected in the current PSUR period. The obvious question of a possible role 
underreporting was the topic of a specific question to MAH following the previous PSUR where MAH was 
asked  to  discuss  whether  actions  should  be  taken  to  increase  awareness  and  reporting  of  ADR  for 
Pradaxa. MAH has established educational programmes for treating physicians including tools such as 
the prescriber guides for the various treatment indications and the patient alert card. Both are updated 
and  distributed  whenever new  information  becomes available.  Thus,  the  question  has  been  answered 
satisfactorily. 
In the previous PSUR, the MAH was requested to comment on the large number of pericardial effusion, 
pericardial  hemorrhage  and  cardiac  tamponade  and  whether  or  not  these  cases  are  reflected  in  the 
SmPC. MAH presented a thorough review of the topic “pericardial effusion, pericardial hemorrhage and 
cardiac  tamponade.”  It  was  in  general  accepted  that  the  increase  seen  reflects  an  increased  use  of 
Pradaxa  in  patients  with  an  increased  risk  for  bleedings.  It  was  also  agreed  upon,  that  these  patient 
populations  and  risk  factors  have  been  identified  and  are  reflected  in  the  appropriate  section  of  the 
SmPC. However, it is worrying that many of the bleeding events described are due to improper use of 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 25/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the drug, either because of use despite contraindications or because of off-label use. In the next PSUR, 
MAH  is  asked  to  discuss  whether  more  intensive  information  to  prescribing  physicians  about  proper 
indications and especially contraindications should be encouraged. 
It  should  be  noted  that  an  interim  report  on  RE-ALIGN  study  (referenced  in  the  company  response) 
recently resulted in a new contraindication (prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment) 
due  to  an  excess  of  pericardial  bleedings  as  well  as  ischaemic  events  in  patients  treated  with 
dabigatran etexilate compared to patients treated with warfarin. Currently, the inclusion of a warning 
regarding patients undergoing cardiac surgery is being discussed in another procedure (LEG036). 
Regarding long-term treatment the MAH was asked  to address the follow-up trial RELY-ABLE in more 
than 5800 patients with a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. Rates of stroke, major bleeding and death on 
dabigatran  during  RELY-ABLE  were  similar  to  rates  in  RE-LY;  relative  effects  of  the  two  dabigatran 
doses on these outcomes were also consistent with RE-LY. Also, this question has been addressed to a 
satisfactory  extend.  A  third  question  regarding  Pradaxa  treatment  during  cardioversion  was  also 
answered and addressed in the SmPC. 
Overall, the current PSUR reflects solid data collection and reporting. No new safety issues have been 
raised.  
3.  Signal and risk evaluation  
As  the  PSUR  has  been  submitted  in  the  old  format,  due  to  the  transitional  period,  this  section  is 
omitted.  
4.  Benefit evaluation 
As  the  PSUR  has  been  submitted  in  the  old  format,  due  to  the  transitional  period,  this  section  is 
omitted,  and  section  5  has  been  adjusted  to include  the  accompanying  benefit-risk  evaluation,  which 
has another format, than in the new PSUR format. 
5.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefit-Risk analysis for the SPAF indication: 
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  results  from  the  RE-LY  study  is  high.  For  the  first  time,  a  significantly 
decreased  major  bleed  rate  compared  to  well-controlled  warfarin  could  be  demonstrated.  Moreover, 
the  significantly  reduced  risk  of  intracranial  bleeds  for  both  tested  doses  of  DE  is  considered  to 
represent major therapeutic progress increasing the overall acceptance of anticoagulant therapy. When 
risk and benefit were considered both dabigatran doses had smaller risk ratios compared to warfarin. 
Risk  reduction  for  DE  110  mg  bid  and  DE  150  mg  bid  were  8%  and  10%,  respectively  with 
corresponding p values of 0.100 and 0.037. Yearly event rates were 7.08%, 6.89% and 7.62% for DE 
110 mg bid, DE 150 mg bid mg and warfarin groups, respectively. The table below shows an overview 
of the clinically most relevant favourable and undesirable effects of DE as observed in the indication of 
prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation  with 
one or more of the following risk factors. 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 26/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Benefit-Risk analysis for the pVTEp indication: 
It is considered that the benefit to risk ratio at the recommended oral dosages of DE is at least as good 
as the current injectable gold standard. It is concluded that the totality of efficacy and safety data are 
positive for DE in the indication VTE prophylaxis in major orthopaedic surgery. The table below shows 
an overview of the clinically most relevant favourable and undesirable effects of DE as observed in the 
indication  of  primary  prevention  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  in  adult  patients  who  have 
undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery.

6.  Final assessment conclusions and actions  
This is the eighth PSUR for Pradaxa. The report updates safety information on DE given as mesilate for 
the  period  19  Mar  2012  to  18  Sep  2012.  During  the  update  period,  the  MAH  received  9238  case 
reports with a total of 15 689 ADRs. The far most frequent ADR was haemorrhagic events with a total 
of 7437 HP-confirmed ADR case reports during the update period. In 3214 (43.2%) of these cases, at 
least one bleeding event was reported, which is similar to the previous reporting period (44.5%, PSUR 
7). In contrast to warfarin treatment no specific antidote exists for Pradaxa.  However, an antibody is 
under development.  
During  the  period  under  review  the  SmPC  was  updated  with  a  contraindication  recommendation 
against  co-medication  of  Pradaxa  and  dronedarone.  In  addition,  the  SmPC  and  package  leaflet  was 
updated  with  more  precise  specifications  and  clarification  of  already  approved  contraindications. 
Furthermore;  the  section  overdose  was  likewise  updated  with  information  on  bleeding  management. 
Based on a review of the safety data related to the RE-ALIGN study (excess of hemorrhagic pericardial 
effusions in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate), the SmPC section 4.3 has been updated with the 
following contraindication: Prosthetic heart valve replacement (EMEA/H/C/829/II/44). 
The information received during the reporting period concerning the monitoring topics 'hepatotoxicity' 
and 'myocardial infarction' did not reveal any new relevant medical safety information. The number of 
case  reports  received  for  these  topics  is  considered  to  be  low.  However,  as  mentioned  in  the  RMP 
assessment the cumulative reporting rate for myocardial infarction is 3.1 per 10 000 patient-years, in 
the  previous  PSUR  period  the  reporting  rate  was  2.6  events  per  10  000  patient-years  (stated  in  the 
previously submitted RMP with the previous PSUR period). This issue was assessed in the RMP AR and 
considered resolved. 
The  evaluation  of  events  associated  with  renal  impairment  did  not  result  in  any  change  of  the 
assessment provided in the last PSUR 7. However the MAH will continue to monitor this topic. 
PSUR assessment report  
dabigatran etexilate 
Page 28/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Many  of  the  bleeding  events  described  are  due  to  improper  use  of  the  drug,  either  because  of  use 
despite  contraindications  or  because  of  off-label  use.  In  the  next  PSUR,  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss 
whether  more  intensive  information  to  prescribing  physicians  about  proper  indications  and  especially 
contraindications should be encouraged. 
The  benefit-risk  balance  remains  positive  for  DE  for  the  indication  prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic 
embolism  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation  (SPAF)  with  one  or  more  risk  factors  as 
well as for the indication VTE prophylaxis in major orthopaedic surgery (elective total hip replacement 
surgery or total knee replacement surgery). No new safety issues have arisen that would recommend 
changes to the SmPC or RMP.  
Scientific motivation to modify section 4.3 of the SmPC:  
The  contraindication  in  lesion  or  condition  at  significant  risk  for  major  bleeding  which  is  now  in  place 
for Pradaxa does not allow  for medical judgement, especially with regard to the prevention of  VTE in 
surgery  indications  where,  for  example,  an  AV  malformation  or  an  aneurysm  should  not  necessarily 
exclude  a  patient  from  receiving  one  of  the  new  anticoagulants.  This  concern  was  viewed  in 
perspective  of  safety  profile  of  Pradaxa  during  PSUR  period  and  was  acknowledged  by  PRAC  
(a  decreasing  trend  of  cumulative  reporting  rates 
for  serious  bleedings).  Therefore,  the 
contraindication about lesions and conditions is revised slightly allowing the prescribing physician some 
more  room  for  clinical  judgment  on  when  to  consider  the  listed  lesions  and  conditions  as  absolute 
contraindications. 
In addition, the MAH was asked to discuss the need to introduce changes to sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5 
regarding drug-drug interaction profile (see discussion in section 2.4). The issues regarding drug-drug 
interaction for posaconazole, tacrolimus and rifampicin will be further assessed within procedure LEG2 
12.1 after finalisation of this PSUR. 
7.  Request for supplementary information 
As  mentioned  in  the  RMP  assessment  (see  separate  document)  the  cumulative  reporting  rate  for 
myocardial  infarction  is  3.1  per  10  000  patient-years,  in  the  previous  PSUR  period the  reporting  rate 
was  2.6  events  per  10  000  patient-years  (stated  in  the  previously  submitted  RMP  with  the  previous 
PSUR period). The  MAH was asked to comment on this increase.  This issue was assessed in the RMP 
AR and considered resolved.  
8.  Recommendations 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  the  PRAC  considers  by  consensus  that  the 
risk-benefit balance of medicinal products containing the active substance dabigatran etexilate remains 
favourable but recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied as follows: 
Update of Section 4.3 of the SmPC regarding the contraindication to use Pradaxa in patients with lesion 
or condition, if considered at significant risk factor for major bleeding.  
The amendments recommended to be introduced to the product information are detailed in Annex 1. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  is  required  to  submit  by  03  June  2013  the  following  additional 
information (LEG2 012.1)

•  The  MAH  has  not  provided  any  discussion  on  whether  a  caution  or  non-recommendation  is 
warranted  for  posaconazole.  A  brief  summary  of  the  available  data  on  the  P-gp  inhibitory 
potential of posaconazole and a discussion of its implications for Pradaxa should be provided.  
•  The  MAH  has  not  provided  any  discussion  on  whether  a  caution  or  non-recommendation  is 
warranted  or  whether  the  current  contraindication  should  be  kept  for  tacrolimus.  A  brief 
summary of the available data on the P-gp inhibitory potential of tacrolimus and a discussion 
of its implications for Pradaxa should be provided. 
•  Regarding the information on the interaction with rifampicin (and other P-gp inducers) and the 
~66%  reduction  in  dabigatran  exposure  with  concomitant  use,  the  MAH  is  asked  to  consider 
whether  a  contraindication  is  appropriate  in  this  case  given  the  information  gained  from  the 
dose-response studies described in the EPAR for dabigatran. In these studies, a dose-response 
relationship  was  observed  with  respect  to  VTE  rate,  and  the  dabigatran  exposure  in  an 
orthopaedic  patient  receiving  concomitant  rifampicin  could  be  expected  to  be  lower  than  the 
lowest equivalent (daily) dose included in the dose response study. 
In addition, the MAH should also address the following issues in the next PSUR: 
• 
It is worrying that many of the bleeding events described are due to improper use of the drug, 
either because of use despite contraindications or because of off-label use. In the next PSUR, 
MAH  is  asked  to  discuss  whether  more  intensive  information  to  prescribing  physicians  about 
proper indications and especially contraindications should be encouraged. 
In addition, the MAH should submit an updated RMP together with next PSUR in order to 
address the following issues: 
1.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  provide  and  update  in  the  RMP  on  recruitment  for  study  1160.129  when 
submitting a RMP in connection with the next PSUR. 
2.  A continuous update of the development of an antidote is expected with each RMP update.

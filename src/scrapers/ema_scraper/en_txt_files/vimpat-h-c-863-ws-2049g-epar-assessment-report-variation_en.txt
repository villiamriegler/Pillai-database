2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lacosamide (Vimpat) is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset 
seizures (POS) with  or  without  secondary generalization in adults,  adolescents and children from 4  years 
of age with  epilepsy. It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy the treatment of primary generalised tonic-
clonic seizures in adults,  adolescents and children from 4 years of age with  idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
Lacosamide (LCM)  was first approved on 29  August 2008  in the EU as adjunctive therapy in the treatment 
of POS with or without  secondary generalization in adult and adolescent from 16 years of age with  epilepsy. 
Monotherapy indication in  study participants ≥16  years of age was approved on 12 December 2016 in the 
EU. 
The  initial  scope  applied  for  this  variation  was  the  extension  of  LCM  indication  as  monotherapy  and 
adjunctive  therapy in  the  treatment  of  POS with  or  without  secondary generalisation  to  patients  from  1 
month to  <4 years of age. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The previous extension of indication to  paediatric patients  ≥4  years of age was based on extrapolation of 
adult  efficacy data from adjunctive therapy studies  (SP667, SP754,  and SP755) and monotherapy studies 
(SP0993  and  SP902)  and  supported  by  weight-based  paediatric  dosing  adaptations  targeting  similar 
exposures as  those  in  adults  at  therapeutic  LCM  doses  (CL0177  and  CL0266),  and  long-term  safety  of 
adjunctive  LCM  in  paediatric  study  participants  (Pool  SPX-1) (EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G,  approved in 
the EU  on 14  September 2017). 
The  present extension  of indication,  aiming  to  extend  the  POS  indication  as  monotherapy or  adjunctive 
treatment  to  paediatric  patients  under  the  age  of  4  years, is  based  on  efficacy extrapolation  from older 
patient groups and the available clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacology data. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid. The precise 
mechanism  of  its  antiepileptic  effects in  humans  is  not  fully  elucidated,  but  in  vitro  electrophysiological 
studies have indicated a selective enhancement of slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels with 
ensuing stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes. 
2.1.3.  The 
guidance/scientific advice 
development 
programme/compliance 
with 
CHMP 
In July 2011,  the  MAH received advice from the Committee  for Medicinal  Products for Human  Use (CHMP) 
concerning the proposed extrapolation strategy for LCM  as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures 
in  children  with  epilepsy  in  the  age  group  from  2  to  16  years,  the  definition  of  target  dose  range,  and 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 7/65 
 
 
 
 
 
adequacy  of  the  proposed  bridging  strategy  combined  with  literature  review  in  filing  for  LCM  as 
monotherapy in the treatment of POS with or without  secondary generalizations in the age group ≥ 1 month 
and < 18 years (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/528383/2011).   
The  CHMP  agreed  that  extrapolation  of  adult  efficacy  data  is  partly  possible  but  pointed  out  that 
extrapolability down to 2 years did not seem sufficiently supported by the available data. Although there is 
support  from  clinical  experience, data  from  confirmatory trials  would  need  to  be  considered. As  for  the  
definition  of  target dose  range, the  CHMP  pointed  out  the  preferential need for actual data  in  addition  to 
physiological PK modelling. The possibility of a bridging strategy was agreed on down to the age of 4 years, 
but  the  need for data  on  short-term  efficacy, PK and  safety in  the  very young  paediatric  population  (≥1 
month to  2 years) was recognized. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The  currently approved formulations,  10  mg/ml  syrup  and  film  coated  tablets  50,  100,  150  and  200  mg 
and 10 mg/ml solution  for infusion, were initially proposed to  be used in children from 1 month of age. No 
new formulation was developed for the lower age group applied. 
The  current  approved dosing  devices  for  Vimpat  10  mg/ml  syrup  and  Lacosamide  UCB  10  mg/ml  syrup 
drug products are a 30 ml measuring cup and 10 ml dosing syringe and a bottle adaptor. 
The MAH  initially proposed to  register an additional  5 ml syringe, as a consequence of the  initial  proposed 
extension  of  indication  to  patients  from  1  month  of  age  and  to  allow  accurate  dosing  in  the  youngest 
paediatric population initially proposed in this application. In view of the final revised extension of indication 
to children from 2 years of age, the MAH  has justified that  the new 5 ml oral syringe will not be included in 
the packaging and is no longer applied for.  
The  syrup  contains  the  excipients  glycerol,  carmellose  sodium,  sorbitol  liquid  (crystallizing),  macrogol, 
sodium  chloride,  anhydrous  citric  acid,  acesulfame  potassium,  sodium  methyl  parahydroxybenzoate, 
strawberry  flavour  (contains  propylene  glycol,  maltol),  masking  flavour  (contains  propylene  glycol, 
aspartame, acesulfame potassium, maltol, deionised water) and purified water. 
The syrup is  filled in  amber glass bottles  with  a  screw cap (polypropylene). The  bottle,  filled  with  200  ml 
syrup, will be provided with a 30 ml measuring cup and a 10 ml oral syringe (black graduation marks) with 
an adaptor.  
Suitability of the formulation for the paediatric population. 
In 
line  with 
the  Guideline  on  pharmaceutical  development  of  medicines 
for  paediatric  use 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012  Rev.2, the suitability of the proposed formulation in the proposed age group 
has been satisfactorily addressed considering the  safety profile of the  excipients for children in  the target 
age groups in relation to exposure.  
For aspartame the MAH refers to the ADI of 40 mg/kg bw/day as established by EFSA. However, ADI values 
established by  EFSA,  do not  apply  to  infants  below 12  weeks of  age [EFSA,  Scientific Opinion,  'Guidance 
for submission  for food additive evaluations', ANS,  EFSA Journal,  Vol.  10(7),  2012,  p.  2760.].  Given  that 
extrapolation of efficacy below 2 years of age is not supported, the use of aspartame in the formulation for 
infants  below  12  weeks is not  further assessed at  this  stage.  The use  of aspartame for infants  above 12 
weeks is judged acceptably justified. 
The addition of the warning  “Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to  assess aspartame use in 
infants below 12 weeks of age.” in section 4.4 of the SmPC is agreed.  
Suitability of the Container closure system, including the additional dosing device 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 8/65 
 
 
 
 
The same container closure system as already on the market, is intended to be used in all age groups. The 
current  approved  dosing  devices  are  a  30  ml  polypropylene measuring  cup  and  10  ml  dosing  syringe 
(comprising  a  polypropylene barrel  and  a  high-density  polyethylene  plunger)  and  a  bottle  adaptor  (low-
density polyethylene). 
As  a  consequence  of  the  lower  dose  for  younger  children,  more  than  2  months  in-use  shelf-life  will  be 
needed  to  allow  these  younger  children  to  consume  the  full  content  of  a  Vimpat  10  mg/ml  syrup  or 
Lacosamide UCB  10  mg/ml  syrup bottle.  It  is  therefore proposed to  increase the  in-use  shelf life  from  2 
months to 6  months. 6 months in-use stability  data is provided in  support of this  change. 
Dosing device 
The already approved package contains a 30 ml measuring cup, a 10 ml dosing syringe and a bottle adaptor 
which is considered sufficient to  cover the recommended doses from 2 years of age.  
Due to  the recommendation to use the 30 ml measuring cup when the required dose is more than 200 mg 
(20  mL),  uniformity  of  dose  data  has  been  added  for  the  25  ml  and  30  ml  doses in  section  3.2.P.2.4. 
Previously data has been presented for the  5 ml,  10  ml, 15  ml and  20 ml  doses. The  measuring cup  with 
graduation  markings of  5  ml, 10  ml,  15  ml,  20  ml,  25  ml and  30  ml complies with  acceptance criteria of 
Ph.Eur. 2.9.27. 
Extension of the in-use shelf-life of Vimpat 10 mg/ml syrup and Lacosamide UCB 10  mg/ml syrup 
As  a  consequence  of  the  lower  dose  for  younger  children,  more  than  2  months  in-use  shelf-life  will  be 
needed  to  allow  these  younger  children  to  consume  the  full  content  of  a  Vimpat  10  mg/ml  syrup  or 
Lacosamide UCB  10  mg/ml  syrup bottle.  It  is  therefore proposed to  increase the  in-use  shelf life  from  2 
months to 6  months. 6 months in-use stability  data for the syrup is provided in support of this change. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to provide the full shelf life 36 months long term stability data for three 
batches, manufactured by Istituto  De Angeli S.r.l. 
In-use testing was performed on two batches - one aged and one freshly manufactured. Both batches were 
manufactured approximately 4  months  prior  to  the  start  of  the  study.  The  packaged product  was  stored 
upright  at  30°C/75%  RH  and was sampled twice  a day (weekdays only) for 6  months and  each time, 0.7 
mL  of  the  contents  was  removed to  mimic  patient  use.  One  batch  was  tested  at  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5  and  6 
months whilst  the other batch was tested at  30, 31, 32,  33, 34,  35 and 36 months. All results were within 
specifications  and  confirms  that  a  repeated  withdrawal  of  syrup,  from  the  container  and  the  resulting  
contact  with  air  and  the  dosing  device  during  a  typical  in-use-period  had  no  significant  impact  on  the 
product quality once the closure system has been opened. 
Based on  the  submitted  in-use  stability  results  the  increase of  the  in-use  shelf  life  from  2  months  to  6 
months is acceptable. 
IV  formulation 
The  currently  approved formulation,  10  mg/ml  Solution  for  infusion  for  children  from 4  years of  age,  is 
intended  also  to  be  used  in children  from  2  years of  age.  The  excipients  in  the  solution  for  infusion  are 
water for injections, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment).  
The solution is filled in type 1  glass vials with  an extractable volume of not less than 20  ml. The same vial 
size 20 ml as already approved is intended to be used for all age groups. 
Suitability of the formulation for the paediatric population. 
The excipients, as described above, included in the current formulation are commonly used and of no safety 
concern for the use in children from 1 months of age.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 9/65 
 
 
 
 
The  solution  for infusion  is  not  supplied  with  a  measuring device and based  on the  dosing regimen  1  ml 
syringes with  0.01  increments,  commonly available in  hospitals  and pharmacies, are suitable  for  dosing. 
No issues with regards to  accuracy and precision are expected. 
The need and possibility  to develop a smaller presentation, suitable for children  has been addressed. The 
conclusion  not  to  develop  a  smaller  presentation  for  children  is  acceptable  since  it  is  a  temporary 
replacement from oral administration, handled and administered by highly trained medical professionals in 
hospital. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  new clinical data  have been submitted  in  this  paediatric extension of indication,  which was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  previously  submitted  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  including  juvenile  toxicity 
studies,  included and reviewed in the  Vimpat marketing authorisation  application (MAA),  are summarised 
below. The relevant findings are reflected in  the Product Information. 
An updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided in this submission. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non-clinical development program has been conducted in adult and juvenile animals. The 
juvenile  studies  (see  below)  were  presented  and  evaluated  the  first  extension  of  indication  to  include 
monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the  treatment of  partial-onset seizures with  or without  secondary 
generalisation in children from 4 to less than  16 years old with  epilepsy (EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G).

As  further discussed  in  EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G,  the  types  of  toxicity  observed in  juvenile rats  and 
dogs do not differ qualitatively from that observed in adult animals. In juvenile dogs, central nervous system 
(CNS)  clinical  signs  such as  tonic  convulsions,  emesis, lateral position,  staggering  gait,  and  tremor were

considered dose-limiting. In contrast, only few clinical signs were observed in the juvenile rats and despite 
initially higher exposure these were less severe than at comparable dose levels in  adult rats. 
Potential  effects of  long-term  treatment  with  LCM  on  the  developing  brain  were assessed in  a  pre-  and 
post-natal  study in  rats and repeat-dose toxicity  studies in  juvenile rats and  dogs. These studies  included 
detailed CNS histopathology after perfusion fixation as well as observational neurological screening, reflex 
testing  and  a  series of neurofunctional  tests.  There were  no significant  effects in  any of  the  investigated 
parameters with exception of findings in the open field test at 8 days after cessation of dosing in the juvenile 
rat study; a slightly decreased latency time to move from the centre sector suggesting a potential anxiolytic 
effect  of  LCM.  In  previous  secondary  pharmacology  studies,  LCM  was  active  in  the  stress-induced 
hyperthermia model for stress-related anxiety in mice but  not  in two  other models for anxiety in rats, the  
social interaction and  the elevated plus  maze tests.  Thus,  the relevance of potential  anxiolytic-like effects 
of LCM  in rats remains equivocal. In juvenile dogs with  start of dosing at an age of 7-8 weeks, there were 
no LCM-related findings  upon reflex and neurofunctional testing  with  exception of increased salivation. No 
macroscopic or histopathological findings  were noted in the brains of juvenile rats or dogs.  
In  the  juvenile  dogs,  there  was  no  LCM-related  effect  on  body  weight,  body  weight  gain  or  growth 
parameters. In contrast, in juvenile rats, marked reductions in body weight and/or body weight gain were 
dose-limiting.  As  a  secondary effect  to  this,  a  slightly  delayed development  of  the  high-dose  groups  in 
general was observed but appeared not to result in any functional consequences. The body weight changes 
were considered likely a consequence of general toxicity due to high plasma exposure observed at young rat 
age and not  a specific effect on juvenile growth. A contribution of CNS effects resulting in  reduced suckling 
was considered plausible. 
In safety pharmacology studies, transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases 
in  blood  pressure  most  likely  due  to  a  cardio  depressive  action  were  observed  after  intravenous 
administration  in anesthetized adult  dogs. In  anesthetized adult  dogs and monkeys, at  intravenous doses 
of 15  to 60  mg/kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity,  AV block and AV dissociation were seen. 
Electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  were  recorded  in  the  juvenile  dog  studies  with  no  significant  abnormalities 
observed. Further, there were no LCM-related findings in the heart upon macroscopical or histopathological 
examination neither in  the dog nor in the  rat.  
In  juvenile  rats,  LCM-treatment  caused  dose-related  increased  levels  of  plasma  alkaline  phosphatase, 
cholesterol  as  well  as  alanine  transaminase  activity.  These  changes  were  reversible within  the  4-week 
recovery period. Compared to studies with adult  rats, the changes were milder and liver weights were not 
increased. No effects on liver parameters were noted in juvenile or adult dogs.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  ERA  in  this  application  which  accounts  for  the  extended  paediatric 
indication. The potential environmental impact was performed using refined market penetration data (FPEN) 
based on published epilepsy prevalence information. 
The revised risk characterisation for LCM  has been carried out by  comparing the  PEC/PNEC  ratios against 
respective  triggers  given  in  section  5.2  of  CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  1  (June  2006).  The  results  are 
presented in the  table below:  
Summary of fate and effect analysis: 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 11/65 
 
 
 
 
Based  on  worst  case  market  penetration  values,  the  revised PEC/PNEC  ratios  are  lower  than  the  ERA 
guideline  Tier  B  trigger  values.   Therefore, the  use  of LCM,  in  the  current  agreed indications  and  in  the  
proposed extension of indication,  is unlikely to present a risk to the terrestrial and aquatic environments. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  procedure.  The  non-clinical  data  submitted  and 
assessed 
in 
the  original  MAA  and 
in 
the  previous  paediatric  extension  of 
indication 
(EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G)  are considered adequate to support the extension of the  LCM indication. 
The main targets  of toxicity in  adult animals were the  cardiovascular system and liver where effects were 
seen  at  no  or  low  margins  of  exposure.  In  juvenile  rats  and  dogs,  the  types  of  toxicity  do  not  differ 
qualitatively from those  observed in adult  animals. In  juvenile rats, a reduced body weight  was observed 
at systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure. In juvenile dogs, transient  and dose-
related CNS  clinical  signs  started to  be observed at  systemic exposure levels below  the  expected clinical 
exposure.  
In  the  juvenile  rat  study,  dosing  was  initiated  at  an  age  of  7  days.  A  7-days-old  rat  corresponds 
(approximately) to a  term neonate  based on overall CNS and  reproductive development.   In  the juvenile 
dog study,  dosing  was initiated  at  an  age of 7  to  8 weeks corresponding (approximately) to  a  2-year-old 
child. The MAH  also refers to pre- and post-natal studies in rats with  administration of LCM in utero and via 
milk for up to 3 weeks, corresponding to a human age of 0-2 years. The exposure of the F1 pups was ~ 6% 
to  8%  of  the  exposure of  the  lactating  F0  females,  whatever the  dose.  In  summary,  the available  non-
clinical studies are considered appropriate to cover the age of the intended patient population.   
The findings are adequately reflected in the SmPC and the CHMP agreed that no further updates are needed. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view, the  CHMP  agreed that  there  are no  objections regarding  the  proposed 
extension of the indication. 
The  CHMP  agrees with  the  ERA  conclusions  that  the  extended  indication  does  not  lead  to  a  significant 
increase in environmental exposure to LCM.  LCM is not  expected to pose a risk to the  environment.

CL0447-Part  I  was  developed  with  data  from  study  participants  with  primary  generalised  tonic-clonic  
seizures (PGTCS) from SP0982. CL0447-Part  II included data from 9 orally dosed studies (EP0008, SP754, 
SP755,  SP847,  SP1047,  SP848,  SP0969,  SP0966,  SP0982)  in  paediatric study  participants  with  epilepsy 
ranging from ≥1 month  to <18 years of age. In CL0447-Part III, the final datasets of EP0060, a study that 
investigated  the  safety and  tolerability  of iv  LCM  in  children  ≥1month  to  <17  years of  age with  epilepsy, 
were combined with CL0447-Part II to assess the degree of similarity in exposures for the iv and oral routes 
of administration.  The  PK model CL0447-Part  III was submitted  part  of response to  questions  on  EP0060 
Article  46  submission  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/000863/P46/037).  CL0447-Part  IV  was  developed  for  this  
submission  to  support  LCM  indication  extension  to  children  1  month  of  age  and  older.  CL0447-Part  IV 
includes data from the recently completed study of LCM as adjunctive therapy in study participants ≥1month 
to <4years of age who  had epilepsy with  uncontrolled POS (SP0967).  
Summary of LCM  PK profile in adults (≥ 18 years of age) 
The PK of LCM  has been studied in healthy adult study participants, as well as adult study participants with 
epilepsy,  neuropathic  pain,  and  renal  and/or  hepatic  impairment.  The  characterization  of  the  PK  and 
pharmacodynamic (PD)  of  LCM  in  clinical  studies  for  POS  with  the  adult  and  paediatric  population  was 
provided in the initial  MAA.  
Healthy adults 
Results  from the  Phase1 studies in  healthy  study participants  showed  that  LCM  is  rapidly and completely 
absorbed  after  oral  administration  with  negligible  first-pass  effect.  The  high  oral  bioavailability  (F)  of 
approximately 100% is not affected by food. Maximum (peak) plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur between 
0.5 and 4 hours postdose after oral administration under fasted and fed conditions. Exposure is proportional 
to  dose,  with  low  intraparticipant  and  interparticipant  variability. Plasma  elimination  half-life  (t½)  of the  
unchanged  drug  is  approximately  13  hours  and  is  dose-and  time-invariant.  Steady-state  plasma 
concentrations (Css) are achieved after 3 days.  
The volume of distribution (Vd) is approximately 0.6L/kg. LCM  is less than 15% bound to  plasma proteins. 
LCM is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation. About 40% of the  
dose is renally excreted as unchanged compound.  
The  major  metabolic  pathway  of  LCM  is  demethylation.  The  O-desmethyl  metabolite  (referred  to  as 
SPM12809)  is  excreted in  the  urine  and  represents  about  30%  of  dose.  This  metabolite  has  no  known 
pharmacological activity. In vitro results showed that  major cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes (CYP) involved 
in  the  formation  of  SPM12809  are  CYP2C19,  CYP2C9,  and  CYP3A4.  Results  from  clinical  studies  in  poor 
metabolizers  and  extensive  metabolizers  for  CYP2C19  and  a  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  study  with 
omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor)  demonstrated that  the formation of SPM12809  in  humans is mediated by 
CYP2C19.  
LCM  is  not  an  inducer  or  inhibitor  of  CYPs,  except  for  in  vitro  inhibition  of  CYP2C19  that  was  clinically 
irrelevant. In  vitro,  using  Caco-2 monolayer cell systems,  LCM  was  not  a  substrate for  P-glycoprotein or 
other  active transporters and did  not  modulate  the  transport of  digoxin at  concentrations  up  to  3mmol/L 
(750μg/mL).   
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  LCM  PK  among  Asian,  Black,  and  Caucasian  study 
participants.  No  clinically  relevant difference in  LCM  exposure was  observed  between  CYP2C19  EMs  and 
PMs.  
During  clinical  development,  in  vivo  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  to  demonstrate  the 
bioequivalence of  the  LCM  oral  solution  with  the  tablet.  In  SP657,  bioequivalence was  shown  between  2 
tablets  of  LCM  100mg  and  an  oral  solution  containing  LCM  200mg  (10mg/mL)  after  oral  single-dose 
administration.

LCM  PK in adults with  POS 
A comparative summary of the PK of LCM in study participants with POS was submitted in the MAA. Overall, 
the  PK  of  LCM  were  considered equivalent  in  study  participants  with  POS  compared with  healthy  study 
participants.  
LCM plasma concentrations showed dose-proportionality after oral administration in study participants with 
POS. PopPK modelling in  study participants  with  POS showed that  the  typical PK  parameter estimates for 
elimination  rate  constant  (ke),  t½,  and  apparent volume  of  distribution  (V/F)  were  comparable with  PK 
parameters determined in Phase1 studies in healthy study participants (by noncompartmental analysis and 
by popPK modelling). The LCM popPK parameters showed low and comparable interindividual variability in 
study  participants  with  POS  as  well  as  in  healthy  study  participants,  indicating  that  LCM  plasma 
concentrations are highly predictable. 
A  pooled analysis of  antiepileptic  drug  (AED) plasma  concentrations  in  study  participants  with  POS from 
SP667, SP754,  and SP755 showed  that  there was no evidence for any relevant DDI of LCM  with  common 
AEDs. 
To  evaluate any  differences in  LCM  exposure between  LCM  monotherapy and  LCM  adjunctive  therapy  in 
study participants  with  POS, LCM  plasma concentrations from controlled studies were compared. The LCM 
Css observed during LCM monotherapy in SP902 were similar to Css observed during adjunctive LCM therapy 
in SP754 and SP755. 
LCM  PK in adults with  renal or hepatic impairment 
Compared with  healthy  study participants,  the  area under  the plasma  concentration-time curve (AUC)  of 
LCM  was increased by approximately 30% in study participants with  mild and moderate renal impairment, 
and by  60% in  study  participants with  severe renal impairment or with  end-stage  renal disease requiring 
haemodialysis, whereas Cmax was unaffected. 
Study participants with  moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations 
of  LCM  (approximately  50%  higher  weight-normalized  AUC).  The  higher  exposure  was  partly  due  to  a 
reduced renal  function  in  the  study  participants.  The  decrease in  non-renal (metabolic)  clearance  in  the 
study participants was estimated to increase the AUC of LCM  by 20%.  The PK of LCM was not evaluated in 
study participants with  severe hepatic impairment. 
Loading dose in  adults 
Simulations were performed based on the PK characteristics of LCM  to generate the  expected LCM plasma 
concentration-over-time-profiles. The results showed that the LCM 200mg loading dose (oral or iv) followed 
by  multiple-dose  administration  of  LCM  100mg  twice  a  day  (bid)  (oral  or  iv)  resulted  in  plasma 
concentrations  comparable  to  those  achieved  over  time  with  bid  administration  of  LCM  100mg. 
Furthermore,  data  from  selected  Phase1  studies  in  healthy  study  participants  after  single-dose 
administration of LCM  200mg (which corresponds to an “initial”  or “loading dose”) compared with multiple-
dose  administration  of  LCM  100mg  (which  corresponds  to  maintenance  dosing)  were  in  line  with  the 
simulated plasma-concentration curves. 
These data  and results of simulations (along with  data pertaining to  the safety of a loading dose) resulted 
in  approval for the  initiation  of  oral and  iv LCM  in  patients  weighing  50  kg or  more with  a single  loading 
dose of 200mg, followed approximately 12hours later by 100mg bid (200mg per day), continued for 1week, 
and then titrated  by 50mg  bid (100mg per day) every week. 
Summary of LCM  PK profile in paediatric study participants with epilepsy ≥4 to <16 years of age 
Based on  the  popPK  model (CL0177),  the  Vd/F  of  LCM  in  the  paediatric  population  was  estimated  to  be 
50.6L  for a body weight of 70kg, or approximately 0.7L/kg (95%  confidence interval [CI]: 0.6 to 0.8L/kg), 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 15/65 
 
 
 
 
consistent  with  the  value reported  in  adults  (0.6L/kg).  Plasma  protein  binding  of  LCM  is  insignificant  in 
adults (<15%),  and no change is expected to  occur in paediatric patients. 
Using  the  data  from  the  paediatric  popPK analysis  (CL0177),  the  typical  apparent  clearance (CL/F)  was 
1.36L/h  (0.79mL/min/kg)  at the  mean population  body weight  of 28.9kg in  the  absence of inducer AEDs. 
It ranged from 0.70L/h (1.17mL/min/kg)  for a body weight of 10kg to 2.37L/h (0.56mL/min/kg)  for a body 
weight of 70kg. The typical t½ derived from CL/F and Vd/F in the absence of other effects was predicted to 
reach  7.2  hours,  10.6  hours,  and  14.8  hours  at  body  weights  of  10,  28.9,  and  70kg,  respectively. The 
predicted value for 70kg was  consistent with  the t½  values of 13  to  16  hours reported in adults  (Cawello 
et al, 2014). 
Graphical analyses and visual predictive checks (VPCs) indicated that the final 1-compartment popPK model 
(with  oral first-order and iv zero-order input)  was appropriate for describing the available oral and iv LCM 
PK data. 
Bioavailability  was  estimated  at  89.9%  (95%  CI:  72.1%,  96.8%)  indicating  a  close  correspondence  in 
exposure between oral-and iv-dosed study participants.  Simulations of the proposed maximum LCM doses 
of 6mg/kg bid (12mg/kg/day) for patients weighing  11kg to<30kg, 4mg/kg bid (8mg/kg/day) for patients  
weighing ≥30kg to <50kg, and 200mg bid (400mg/day) for patients weighing ≥50kg, resulted in pediatric 
exposures consistent with  adult exposures. 
The oral dosing scheme positioned the  model predicted paediatric Css values in  the adult  range; iv dosing 
resulted  in  slightly  higher  exposures due  to  the  oral  bioavailability  of  89.9%.  Individual  predictions  for 
paediatric  study  participants  were  mostly  contained  within  the  model-predicted  range,  illustrating  the 
adequacy of the individual model predictions. 
Based on  these data, the  maximum recommended iv dosing adaptations  in paediatric patients  ≥4  to <16 
years of age are the same as those approved for oral treatment in this age group. It is proposed that oral 
dosing can be replaced with  iv dosing without  further dose adaptation. 
A covariate analysis of the paediatric popPK data did not  detect a significant effect of gender, age, or race 
on clearance (CL) in paediatric study participants. 
The effect of genetic polymorphisms was not evaluated in the paediatric studies. However, based on results 
of PK in  studies in healthy adults, no dose adjustment is expected to be needed in paediatric patients who 
are CYP2C19 PMs or paediatric patients  who receive a concomitant CYP2C19-inhibiting  drug. 
Lacosamide PK in paediatric study participants with epilepsy ≥1 month to <4 years  of age 
Study SP0967 
One  of  the  objectives  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  PK  of  LCM  (as  adjunctive  therapy)  in  study 
participants ≥1 month  to <4 years of age who had epilepsy with  uncontrolled POS. 
LCM  dosing  
Study participants were titrated over 20 days (Table 1), with dosing flexibility allowed based on tolerability, 
to attain the target dose of 4mg/kg bid (8mg/kg/day) to 6mg/kg bid (12mg/kg/day). LCM was administered 
as an oral solution.

Study participants  who achieved an LCM  dose of at least 4mg/kg bid  (8mg/kg/day) for the  final 3 days of 
the  Titration  Period  entered  a  7-day  Maintenance  Period  on  the  dose  achieved  on  the  final  day  of  the 
Titration Period. No adjustments to study medication dose were allowed during the  Maintenance Period. 
Timing of PK sampling 
Blood samples for the determination of LCM plasma concentrations were to be obtained on Day17 (Visit 5) 
of the 20-day Titration Period and Day 27 (Visit  6), the final day of the 7-day Maintenance Period. 
PK results 
Descriptive statistics  of LCM plasma concentrations by maintenance dose levels at Day27 (Visit 6),  overall 
and by age group, for the pharmacokinetic per-protocol set (PK-PPS) are presented in Table 2. 
Table 2 LCM  plasma concentration (μg/mL) by maintenance dose level -overall and by age group (PK-PPS) 
Overall, LCM plasma concentrations at each dose level were generally similar at Day17 (Visit 5) and Day27 
(Visit  6).  The  mean  LCM  plasma  concentrations  generally  increased  with  dose  (5.3423  μg/mL  at 
8mg/kg/day, 9.4100  μg/mL  at  10  mg/kg/day, and 9.4224  μg/mL  at 12  mg/kg/day); however, there was 
substantial interparticipant  variability due to the  small sample size at several of the  dose levels. 
Population PK Analysis 
The  main PK  support  for the  extensions of  indication  comes from the  results  of  the  simulations  using  an 
existing  popPK model  of LCM  (CL0447).  An overview of  the  previously developed popPK models  and  the 
corresponding modelling and simulation and clinical studies is provided in Table 4. Data from Phase 3 study 
SP0967  (≥1 month  to  <4  years) were included  popPK analysis CL0447-Part  IV which  is further  described

Data 
PK data from 11 studies (Table 4) were combined and analysed. The full LCM  Part IV PK data file contained 
a total  of 7114  LCM  concentration records from 1884 study  participants. The SP0967 data were examined 
for  concentrations with  extreme residuals  (absolute  value of  conditional  weighted  residual  |CWRESI|>4) 
and  four data  points  were excluded from analysis for  this  reason. Records with  a  missing time  since  last 
dose  were  excluded from  analysis.  In  total  6  patients  including  10  PK  samples were  excluded  from the  
SP0967  data.  After  application  of  the  data  exclusion flags,  6490  quantifiable  LCM  concentration  records 
remained  for  analysis  in  1655  study  participants,  including  231  concentration  records  in  122  study 
participants for SP0967.

Methods 
An  existing  LCM  popPK  1-compartment  model  (CL0447–Part  III)  that  comprised  first-order  absorption 
(oral)/zero-order input (iv) was extended with  data from study participants from SP0967.  
The  developed final  popPK  model comprised first  order  absorption,  single  compartment  distribution,  and 
first order elimination components, where CL, central volume (Vc), and absorption rate constant (Ka) were 
estimated  with  exponential  inter-individual  variability  (IIV). Offdiagonal  IIV elements  were assessed  but 
led  to  highly  over-parameterized models and  therefore only  diagonal  IIV estimates  were estimated.  The 
effect of weight on CL  and Vc was quantified  using allometric equations where the  exponent for weight  on 
CL  was freely estimated, and  the exponent  for weight  on Vc  was fixed to  the  theoretical value of  1.  With 
the  inclusion  of  data  from  SP0967  the  suitability  of  the  previously  developed  structural  model  was 
reassessed and updated. In addition, it  was reassessed whether allometric exponents should be estimated 
to adequately describe the  data, or whether they could be fixed to theoretical values.

A stepwise covariate modelling search was performed to assess potential covariates associated with the CL 
of  LCM.  Forward  covariate selection  was  performed using  a  p-value of  p<0.05  (χ2
selection  criterion.  Subsequently,  backwards  deletion  was  performed  using  a  p-value  of  p<0.001 
(χ2
the  previous  modelling,  and  hence  were  also  included  in  the  current  analysis:  Asian  race,  inducer 
p=0.001,ν=1=10.83) as  the  selection criterion.  The  following  covariates were  identified  to  influence  CL  in 
p=0.05,ν=1=3.84) as  the 
coadministration  (carbamazepine  [CBZ],  phenytoin  [PHT],  phenobarbital  [PB]),  valproic  acid  (VPA) 
coadministration, post conceptual age (PCA), sex, eGFR.  
The effect of PCA on the exposure was of special interest for the paediatric population, and the applicability 
of  a  sigmoid-Emax  maturation  function  of  PCA  on  CL  was  investigated.  Body  weight  (at  baseline)  was 
included  a priori in  the  base model according to  allometric theory on  CL  and Vc,  scaled to a  typical  adult 
male value of 70  kg. 
Goodness of fit  plots  and  VPCs were used to  ascertain the  ability  of the  final  popPK model  to  adequately 
describe and simulate  observed LCM  concentrations. Parameter precision and  derive confidence intervals 
the SIR procedure as implemented in Perl-speaks-Nonmem was applied to provide an estimate of parameter 
precision. 
Simulations  were performed to assess if predicted  LCM  paediatric Css fall within  the range of  adult  values 
(without  any comedication), and if these values are comparable between oral and iv dosing in children for 
the  same  dosing  regimen.  In  addition,  the  impact  of  comedication  was  investigated,  comparing  a 
monotherapy setting (by switching  off any covariate related to comedication with AEDs) with the results of 
simulations of the whole population with add-on treatment including subjects with and without  inducer AED 
coadministration. The NHANES  DXA database [18]  was used to provide linked demographic variables (age 
and weight) to  drive the simulations (Figure 1).

Simulations to support dose selection 
Paediatric maintenance doses 
The  population  estimates  from  the  final  popPK  model  were  used  to  simulate  Css  values  for  all  study 
participants in the  NHANES database with the  following dosing schedule: 
•  7.5 mg/kg bid (oral) or 5 mg/kg tid  (three times a day) (iv) for weight  <6 kg 
•  6 mg/kg bid (oral) dose for ≥6  kg and weight  <30kg 
•  4 mg/kg bid (oral) dose for ≥30  kg and weight  <50 kg 
•  200 mg bid (oral) dose for weight ≥50  kg 
Simulations  of  the  proposed weight-based  doses to  produce exposure  equivalent  to  200mg  bid  in  adults 
resulted in paediatric exposures in line with  adult exposures after oral and iv dosing as illustrated in Figure 
7  and  Figure  8,  respectively.  Intravenous  dosing  resulted  in  slightly  higher  exposures  due  to  the  
bioavailability of  84.7%.  In all  panels of  the  figures,  the  pink  shaded area depicts  90%  of  the  simulated 
average  LCM  Css  over  24  hours  in  adults  receiving  LCM  200mg  bid  orally  (without  inducer  AED-
coadministration),  and  the  red  line  and  blue  shaded  area depict  the  median  and  90%  of  the  simulated 
paediatric  Css  values  for  monotherapy  (left)  and  add-on  therapy  with  inducer  AEDs  (right)  by  age  (top

panels)  and  by  weight  (bottom  panels).  The  orange  circles  indicate  the  predicted  Css  values  for  the 
paediatric individuals in all studies. The concentrations also fell within the same range for monotherapy and 
for add-on therapy with  inducing AEDs; therefore, the  same doses can be used regardless of concomitant 
inducer AED therapy.

Summary of LCM  PK profile in paediatric patients ≥1 month to <4 years of age 
Absorption 
No  specific studies  have been performed to  evaluate the  absorption of LCM  in  study participants  ≥1month 
to  <4years  of  age  who  have  epilepsy  with  POS.  The  observations  in  SP0967  that  nearly  all  plasma 
concentrations were in the expected range indicate that extent of absorption of orally administered LCM in 
this age group was consistent  with adult  data. 
In the  popPK analysis, bioavailability was estimated at  84.7%  (95%  CI: 70.7%/92.7%)  indicating  a close 
correspondence in exposure between oral and intravenously dosed study participants. 
Distribution 
The estimate of Vc in  the updated PK model was 45.4 L  (normalised to  a 70  kg person). This is consistent 
with  the previously determined volume of distribution  of LCM of between approximately 40 and 60L. 
Metabolism 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 28/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the metabolism of LCM in study participants ≥1month 
to <4years of age who have epilepsy with POS. PopPK analysis showed that co-administration with hepatic 
enzyme inducing  anti-epileptic  drugs  (CBZ, PHT,  PB,  and/or primidone)  resulted  in  a  22.2%  decrease in 
exposure. 
Excretion 
The estimate of plasma clearance in CL0447-Part  IV was 1.74  L/h  (normalised to  a 70 kg person). Due to  
maturation  of  the  elimination  processes, clearance increases with  age with  50%  of  the  maximum value 
reached at 0.709 years post-conceptional age. The typical plasma clearance was estimated to be 0.22 L/h, 
0.46 L/h,  0.81 L/h,  1.03 L/h  and 1.34 L/h  for paediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg and 
50 kg, respectively. 
Influence of intrinsic factors 
Age and gender 
A maturation  function  for CL  could be  defined i.e.  a relation  between post-conceptional  age and  CL.  This 
maturation results in  a lower clearance in the  youngest patients  than  expected based on weight  alone. No 
effect of gender was detected. 
Race 
According to  the popPK analysis influence on CL was detected for Japanese nationality (13.8%  increase in 
exposure) and  Chinese nationality (17.8%  increase in  exposure). This  is consistent  with  previous results. 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary based on race. 
Body weight 
The results of popPK analysis indicated that  the  PK of LCM  is associated with  body weight  in an allometric 
fashion with an estimated exponent on CL of 0.467  and a fixed exponent on Vc of 1. 
Renal impairment 
In  the  popPK  analysis,  the  eGFR  using  the  Schwartz  bedside  equation  was  not  found  to  significantly 
influence CL of LCM, but  SP0967 did not include any study participant with  severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The  effect  of hepatic  impairment  was  not  evaluated in  study  participants  with  epilepsy ≥1  month  to  <4 
years of age. 
2.4.3.  PK/PD modelling 
No PK/PD modelling data have been provided in this submission. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study SP0967 
The starting dose was 4 mg/kg/day (2 mg/kg bid) with  titration increments of 2 mg up to a maximum dose 
of 12  mg/kg/day. Sparse PK data  was collected in study  SP0967 with  two  PK samples per patients  at day 
17 and 27,  respectively. Due to  the sparseness of data, descriptive PK should be interpreted with caution. 
Nonetheless,  plasma concentrations  from  106  patients  at  day  27  indicate  that  the  plasma  concentration 
increase with  increasing dose, as expected. It  is also apparent that  across all age groups, close to 50% of 
patients did not  reach maximum dose in the titration  phase.

PopPK analysis 
A  pooled popPK  analysis including  1655  epilepsy  patients  over the  age range  1  month  to  71  years. The 
pooled  analysis  approach is  supported,  although  the  MAH  was  asked to  provide  one  summary table  on 
number of  patients  ≥1 month  to  <4  years including  a description of  the demography and dose history  in 
the target age group. In the response to questions, the MAH provided information that in the  age group 2-
4 years, 96 patients  were included  in the  popPK analysis. The mean weight,  height,  and body mass index 
were  13.8  kg  [min  7.0  kg,  max  22.8  kg],  81.0  cm,  and  15.3  kg/m2,  respectively.  The  median  overall 
duration  of LCM  exposure was 41 days (range: 1  to 722  days). The median of the  minimum dose at  time 
of PK sampling was 5.00  mg/kg (range: 0.8 to 6.0  mg/kg), and the median of the maximum dose at  time 
of PK sampling was 5.00mg/kg (range: 1.0 to 6.0  mg/kg). 
Adequate model development and evaluation tools have been used. The popPK model for LCM have evolved 
over time and  previous versions of the  model were assessed by CHMP.  In  the present  analysis important 
elements for the target  population such  as allometric scaling and a maturation function  have investigated 
and  included.  The  maturation  function  used  is  based  on  PCA  (PCA  is  calculated  by  starting  with  the 
chronological age  and  subtracting  the  number  of  weeks  of prematurity  from  that  age),  however no  age 
correction  seems  to  have  been  made  which  is  accepted  since  presumably  no  premature  babies  were 
included in the  studies. Baseline body weight was used as a covariate, although time-varying body weight 
could be of relevance in a  paediatric population.  When time-varying body weight  was tested in  the popPK 
model, the estimated CL remained largely the same. Thus, the constant body weight covariate is accepted.   
Although  model  evaluation indicates  an  adequate  model fit  to  data,  to  be  able to  fully  assess the  model 
predictions for children ≥1 month to <4 years of age the MAH was asked to provide VPCs for this age group, 
stratified  on  several  age  groups  and  in  addition  by  different  weight  groups.  Graphs  with  adequate 
stratifications have been provided, however slight modification to the graphs was requested to fully assess 
the  model  performance. The  requested  graphs  were  provided  in  response  to  questions  and  the  model 
performance is acceptable. However, the MAH argues that the estimated bioavailability (84%) is an artefact 
(further discussed under IV dosing),  thus the  actual values of all parameter estimates are questioned and 
should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the final PK model describe the data well and the predicted 
exposures (Css) are considered adequate. 
Simulations to support dose selection 
The following dosing schedules (maximum dose) were found to  best match the adult exposure: 
•  7.5 mg/kg bid (oral) or 5 mg/kg tid  (iv) for weight  <6 kg 
•  6 mg/kg bid (oral) dose for ≥6  kg and weight  <30kg 
•  4 mg/kg bid (oral) dose for ≥30  kg and weight  <50 kg 
•  200 mg bid (oral) dose for weight ≥50  kg 
However,  the  7.5  mg/kg  bid  and  5  mg/kg  tid  (iv)  dosing  regimen  is  higher  than  the  maximum  dose (6 
mg/kg bid)  in study  SP0947. Exposure predictions  (i.e. simulations)  for the dosing regimen used in  study 
SP0947  could  not  be  found.  Therefore, to  support  the  proposed  posology,  the  MAH  provided  exposure 
simulations for both  the dosing regimen used in study SP0976 and the proposed dosing regimen, including 
the dose level 5 mg/kg ≥20 kg and weight <30kg. For patients <6 kg, comparisons of exposures above and 
below the reference exposure interval were provided for both 7.5 mg/kg bid and 6 mg/kg bid, respectively. 
All  adult  reference  exposure  intervals  are  representing  the  adult  exposure  reference  interval  given 
monotherapy oral 200  mg bid  which  is  not  considered representative for  adjunctive therapy as well  as iv 
administration.  In  addition,  it  is  noted  that  different  adult  reference exposure  ranges were  used  in  the 
application  for POS patients  4 to  16  years (EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G).  Thus,  it  is  difficult  to  evaluate 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

the adequacy of the proposed posology in new paediatric population. When an extrapolation approach based 
on PK matching is employed, it is of essence that adequate exposure matching is made and that the target 
exposure range (i.e. adult reference range) is clearly reported. In general, when extrapolating efficacy it is 
important  to  compare  the  paediatric  exposure  to  the  adult  exposure  range  where  efficacy  has  been 
established.  The MAH  has  clarified that  the  reference exposure interval  is based on  simulations  from  the 
pooled adult and paediatric data (popPK analysis - report CL0447), given 200 mg bid adjunctive therapy to 
adult  patients.  These  simulations  result  in  a  reference  interval  for  Cav  of  5.27-13.78  μg/mL,  while  a 
reference interval of 4.51  –  11.7  μg /L  was used  in the  previous extension of  indication for 4-16  year old 
patients. As it is not acceptable that  different adult exposure intervals are used for patients  4-16 year-olds 
and  1  month  to  4  years and  as  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  7.5  mg/kg  dose  in  patients  <6  kg  is  justified 
given if the  comparison is made to the  4.51 – 11.7 μg  /L interval, the  MAH  was asked to provide updated 
exposure comparisons to  the  previously used  interval  (4.51  –  11.7  μg  /L).  The  MAH  provided exposure 
comparisons with  the previously used  interval, and as expected the  predicted paediatric exposure exceed 
the  old reference interval. It is  acknowledged that  the  final popPK model is based on paediatric and adult 
data, and the estimated clearance in this model is lower (1.76 vs 1.92) leading to a higher exposure for all 
age  groups.  It  is  further  reassuring  that  the  reference interval  for  the  adult  monotherapy  setting  was 
approximately 9 – 19 μg /L (EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0065/G)  which is overlapping with the present paediatric 
exposures. The CHMP agrees that the final model describes adult and paediatric data well and is acceptable 
for the  purpose of exposure matching,  however it  would  have been valuable to  have a reference interval 
that  is based on the adult data where efficacy has been established.   
In the previous extension of indication to 4-16 years, an increased Cmax,iv of 9-21% compared to Cmax,oral 
was accepted. Whereas the AUC remained fairly similar between iv and oral administration (assumption of 
100%  oral  bioavailability), the  present popPK  analysis and  subsequent  simulations  suggest  that  the  oral 
bioavailability is 84% and thus the total  concentration (Css) is considerably higher with  iv compared to oral 
administration in the paediatric population. The MAH was asked to discuss the discrepancy in bioavailability 
between the two paediatric extensions of indication. It argued that the estimated oral bioavailability of 84%  
is  an  artefact  and  that  the  previously  established  100%  bioavailability  based  on  clinical  pharmacology 
studies  is  more  accurate.  This  is  agreed,  and  it  is  also  noted  that  the  estimated  oral  bioavailability  is 
informed by only 28 patients with  very sparse data (study EP0060) which  give very limited information.  
Since  the  model  predictions  are  reasonable  despite  the  miss-specified  bioavailability  estimate,  other 
estimates in  the  model have compensated for the  miss-specification and thus  all  parameter estimates,  in 
particular  CL,  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  In  conclusion,  the  predicted  exposures  after  IV 
administration are not reliable and can thus not be used to support IV dosing. Nonetheless, given the same 
reasoning  as used  in  the  age  group  4-16  years, under  the  assumption  of  100%  oral  bioavailability, the  
comparison between oral and IV exposure indicate a slightly higher Cmax with  IV administration but similar 
AUC. In  addition,  the  study EP0060  where IV treatment  was used has  been reviewed in  a P46  procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000863  P46 037)  and no safety concerns were identified.  
PK in target population 
No major deviations from previous knowledge of LCM PK profile were detected in the age group ≥1 month 
to <4  years. The detection of a maturation  function for CL indicates that  not  only body weight  can explain 
differences  in  CL  in  the  youngest  patients.  The  estimated  maturation  showed  that  50%  of  adult  CL  is 
reached at  0.709  years. The typical  plasma clearance  was  estimated  to  be  0.22  L/h,  0.46  L/h,  0.81  L/h, 
1.03 L/h  and 1.34 L/h  for paediatric patients weighing  3.5 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK of  LCM  in  the  age group ≥1  month  to  <4  years of  age has  been investigated  in  a  pooled popPK 
analysis. No unexpected differences in PK from older children and adults were detected.  
The  dose regimens in  POS patients  ≥1  month  to  <4  years are supported  by simulations  from the  popPK 
analysis with  the  aim to match adult  reference exposure levels. Although there are discrepancies between 
reference  intervals  in  different  applications,  it  is  agreed  that  the  proposed  dosing  recommendation  in 
paediatric  patients  match  the  exposure  of  the  adult  patients  sufficiently  well.  It  is  noted  that,  due  the 
extrapolation  of  efficacy under  2  years of  age  not  supported  (see  section  Benefit  Risk  assessment  and 
discussion below), the dose recommendation for patients <6 kg is not relevant. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Background 
The Guideline on clinical investigation  of medicinal products in  treatment of epileptic disorders states that 
efficacy trial results of adults  with  focal epilepsy can be extrapolated to children and adolescents provided 
that  the  PK/PD  relationship  in  adults  is  established  and  that  the  dose  regime  proposed  in  children  and 
adolescents results in similar exposure levels as in adults in all age categories. However, the same guideline 
also emphasizes that  efficacy cannot  be extrapolated in  the very young children due to  the  uncertainty of 
impact  of  the  developing brain  on  the  disease and  response. Once  efficacy has  been  shown  in  the  older 
paediatric  population,  short  term  assessment  of  response  by  using  video  electroencephalogram  (EEG) 
monitoring may be sufficient (CHMP/EWP/566/98  Rev.3). 
In 2011, the MAH  sought advice from the  EMA to discuss clinical development to support indication of LCM 
for monotherapy of POS with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy down to 1 month. 
It was concluded that  it was not  possible to extrapolate to the youngest group aged ≥1  month to <2 years 
group  merely from  PK and  literature;  at  least  short-term  pivotal  data  was  required. The  conclusion  was 
based  on  differences  and  possible  changes  in  receptor  function  and  affinity  due  to  maturation 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/528383/2011). 
The MAH has discussed the  extrapolation of adult data to  paediatric population in  association with  another 
antiepileptic compound brivaracetam (EMEA 000332-PIP01-08-M06),  and in that context it was agreed that 
the treatment of POS with  or without  secondary generalization in paediatric participants down to 2 years of 
age with epilepsy can be based on extrapolation of adult  efficacy data and would  be supported by PK data 
from paediatric participants and by relevant sufficient safety data. 
Subsequently,  it  has  been  put  forth  by  paediatric  epileptologists  and  researchers, during  the  Epilepsy 
Foundation  Research  Roundtable  for  Epilepsy  in  May  2020  with  European  Medicines  Agency  and  FDA 
representatives  in  attendance,  that  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of  POS,  seizure  characteristics  and 
symptoms, EEG features, disease progression, and treatment response are similar in patients ≥1 month to 
<2  years to  those in older, as demonstrated by the  data shared at the  occasion. This view would  support 
the  possibility  that  no  separate  efficacy  studies  (which  would  be  very difficult  to  accomplish)  would  be 
needed for these young children as efficacy can be extrapolated in children ≥1 month to  <2 years of age. 
In  these circumstances, evidence of safety would  need  to  be independently  established in  the  infant  age 
group and could not  be extrapolated.

Treatments 
The double-blind randomization in a 1:1 ratio was done at visit 3 after completion of end-of-baseline video-
EEG and  ascertainment of met  selection criteria, with  age stratification  into  four categories (≥1  month  to 
<6  months;  ≥6  months  to  <1  year; ≥1  year to  <2  years; ≥2  years to  <4  years). The study  medication 
was LCM  as oral solution  (10mg/mL)  and  matching placebo oral solution  twice  a day (with  approximately 
12-hour  intervals).  The  medication  dosing  according to  weight  was  defined  specifically  for  the  titration, 
tapering, or transition periods, depending on whether the patient entered later on the open label extension 
study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of LCM administered concomitantly with 1 to 3 AEDs in 
patients ≥1  month to <4  years of age with  epilepsy who currently have uncontrolled POS. 
The  secondary objective was  to  evaluate the  safety and  tolerability  of  LCM  in  patients  ≥1  month  to  <4 
years of age with  epilepsy who  currently have uncontrolled  POS. An additional  objective was  to  evaluate 
the PK of LCM  in children ≥1 month  to <4 years of age. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  efficacy  variables  were  based  on  video-EEGs  (up  to  72  hours).  POS  frequency  was  based  on 
electrographic seizures for infants ≥1 month to ≤6 months, whereas for infants >6 months to <4 years the 
count was based on electrographic seizures with an accompanying clinical correlate.  Electrographic seizures 
were defined as recognizable ictal patterns on an EEG involving ≥2 contiguous electrodes. The seizures were 
initiated  as  a  unilateral  or  strongly  asymmetric  abnormal  epileptiform  discharge  lasting  a  total  of  >10 
seconds. The video-EEG recordings were evaluated locally by the investigator, subinvestigator, or qualified 
designated reader. The average daily frequency (ADF) of electrographic POS was calculated as (number of 
POS as  recorded on  the  video-EEG divided by  the  number of  interpretable  hours recorded) multiplied  by 
24. 
The primary efficacy variable (US): 
• 
change  in  ADF  of  electrographic POS  as  measured on  the  end-of-maintenance  period video-EEG 
compared  to  the  end-of-baseline  period  video-EEG  (on  condition  that  ≤10%  of  study  patients  
discontinued early; summarized as a secondary efficacy variable if >10% discontinued  early). 
The primary efficacy variable (EU): 
• 
proportion of responders, where a responder was a patient who experienced a ≥50% reduction in 
their  ADF of electrographic POS recorded on the  end-of-maintenance period video-EEG compared 
to the end-of-baseline period video-EEG (was to be considered the primary efficacy variable also in 
the US if >10%  of patients  discontinued early). 
The secondary efficacy variables: 
• 
• 
percent and absolute change in  ADF of electrographic POS from the end-of-baseline period video-
EEG to the end-of-maintenance period video-EEG 
proportion of patients who achieved “seizure-free” status (yes/no) from all seizure types, and from 
POS types only for patients  who completed at least  48 hours of interpretable video-EEG recording 
during the end-of-maintenance period video-EEG

• 
• 
• 
proportion of patients who experienced a ≥25% to <50%, 50% to 75%, or >75%  reduction in ADF 
of electrographic POS from the end-of-baseline period video-EEG to the end-of-maintenance period 
video-EEG 
proportion  of patients  who  experienced no  change in  ADF  of electrographic POS  (between  <25% 
reduction  and  <25%  increase)  from  the  end-of-baseline  period  video-EEG  to  the  end-of-
maintenance period video-EEG 
proportion of patients who experienced an increase in ADF of electrographic POS of ≥25% from the 
end-of-baseline period video-EEG to the end-of-maintenance period video-EEG 
Sample size 
The  planned  number of  patients  to  be  enrolled was  244  (122  per  treatment  arm).  Overall, 255  patients  
were randomized: 128 to LCM  and 127 to placebo, and all took at least 1 dose of study medication.

Statistical methods 
The analysis sets were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the  safety  set  (SS),  the  primary  set  for  safety  variables,  included  all  randomized  patients  who 
received at least 1  dose of study medication. 
The full analysis set (FAS), the primary set for efficacy variables, included all patients  in the SS.  
The  full  analysis  set  source-data  verified  included  all  FAS  patients  who  had  both  their  end-of-
baseline  and  end-of-maintenance  period  video-EEG  eCRF  pages  source  data  verified  at  on-site 
monitoring.  
The per protocol set (PPS), the secondary analysis set for the efficacy data, included all FAS patients 
without  important  protocol deviations related to efficacy

The PK-PPS consisted of  all patients  who  provided at  least one measurable post-dose plasma sample 
with  recorded sampling time on at least one visit with  documented study medication intake times.  
The analyses of the  primary and secondary efficacy variables were based on the  ADF of electrographic 
POS.  All efficacy variables were  summarized for  the  FAS  by  treatment  group.  Additional  populations 
were  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  (including  several analyses  to  address  the  impact  of  COVID-19 
pandemic on the  efficacy results).  
For the US primary efficacy variable, seizure ADF was analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with  terms  for  treatment,  age  stratification  categories,  and  centre  (pooled  appropriately),  on  log-
transformed seizure ADF, and  log-transformed baseline ADF as a covariate. The seizure ADF between 
treatment groups was compared using least squares means (LSMs). The percent reduction over placebo 
was estimated as 100×(1-exp[LSMLCM–LSMplacebo]). The treatment estimates (LSMs and 95% CIs) were 
back-transformed using the exponential function and subtracting 1. The analysis of this efficacy variable 
consisted of all FAS patients with  at least 48  hours of interpretable recordings during  both the end-of-
baseline video-EEG and the  end-of-maintenance period video-EEG. 
For  the  EU  primary  efficacy  variable,  patients  with  a  50%  or  more  reduction  in  seizure  ADF  were 
categorized  as  responders.  This  classification  required  at  least  48  hours  of  interpretable  recordings 
during both the end-of-baseline video-EEG and the end-of-maintenance period video-EEG. Patients with 
0 seizures at baseline were considered non-responders. The proportion of responders between LCM and 
placebo was analysed using  logistic regression with  treatment,  age categories, and center as  factors. 
Odds ratios were presented from this  model along with  the  corresponding 95%  CIs and  p values. The 
number and  percentage of patients  with  a  50%  or more reduction  in  seizure ADF were  presented by 
treatment and age groups. 
Efficacy results 
The primary efficacy variable for the  US was the change in  ADF of electrographic POS as measured on the 
end-of-maintenance  period  video-EEG compared  to  the  end-of-baseline  video recording,  since  the  early 
discontinuance rate was 5.1%  (7.8% in  LCM vs. 2.4% in placebo groups), i.e. remained ≤10%.

Study EP0034: a  Phase 3, multicentre, open-label,  long-term extension  study to investigate  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of LCM  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  pediatric  study  participants (≥1  month  to 
≤17 years of age)  with POS 
EP0034 is an ongoing, long-term safety and efficacy open-label extension study for study participants who 
have completed SP0967 or SP0969. 
A total  of 517  patients  had been  enrolled, including  195  patients  <4  years of  age (all  from SP0967)  and 
322 participants ≥4 years of age (all from SP0969). The main efficacy variable used for the interim analysis 
was based on seizure diary data. EP0034 efficacy data for which baseline data are required, such as seizure 
diary data,  are only available for participants  ≥4  years of  age (entering from  SP0969),  since no baseline 
seizure diary was collected in SP0967. 
Overall, the percentage of seizure-free days and the proportion of all patients achieving seizure-free status 
generally increased over time.  The majority of patients  entering  from SP0969  (all ≥4  years of age) were 
50%  responders from  the  ≤3  month  time  interval  onward  in  the  study  (range:  50.2%  to  69.3%).  The 
proportion of 50% responders and 75% responders from Baseline to the Treatment Period was 50.2% and 
31.8%  respectively. For patients  entering from SP0969, a reduction in  seizure frequency per 28 days was 
also  observed  during  the  Treatment  Period.  Results  of  the  Clinical  and  Caregiver  Global  Impression  of 
Change scales and, to a lesser extent, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory indicate that patients improved 
over the course of the study. 
The  Clinical  and  Caregiver  Global  Impressions  of  Change  results  support  that  the  majority  of  study 
participants improved over the course of the study. In the target population of ≥1 month to <4  years, the 
proportion of study participants  considered by the investigator to  have improved generally increased over 
the  course of  the  study  (range: 85.4%  to  95.0%)  and  considered by the  participants’  caregiver to  have 
improved generally increased over the course of the study (range: 89.2% to 95.0%).

The Pediatric Quality  of Life  Inventory results showed  small positive mean changes in  the majority of  the 
subscale scores and the total score from Baseline to Last Visit, suggesting improvement, and small negative 
mean changes in scores for the Physical components, suggesting worsening. However, these changes were 
associated with  large variability across time points. 
Study SP848: a  Phase 2, open-label  study to determine  safety, tolerability, and efficacy of long-
term oral LCM  as adjunctive  therapy  in children (≥1 month to ≤18 years of age)  with epilepsy 
SP848 is an ongoing, long term safety and efficacy open-label extension study for paediatric patients with 
POS from SP847, participants with  epileptic syndromes associated with generalized seizures from SP0966, 
patients ≥1 month to <18 years of age with epilepsy who were administered iv LCM from EP0060, and from 
patients  who  had  enrolled  directly  without  previous  participation  in  a  LCM  clinical  study  (patients  from 
SP0966 were excluded from the interim  analysis since they do  not provide data on POS in  support of this  
application. 
A total of 323  patients started in the study and were treated with  LCM,  including 37 participants ≥1 month 
to <4  years of age. 
Overall  and  across  age  groups,  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  was  observed  during  the 
Treatment  Period.  The  majority  of  study  participants  were  50%  responders  after  3  months  and  for  the 
duration of the study. The overall proportion of 50% responders and 75% responders from Baseline to the 
Treatment  Period  was  53.7%  and  40.4%  respectively.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  participants  with 
seizure free status  for  at  least 1  of  the  specified time  intervals  during  the  Treatment Period  was  44.4%. 
Comparing across age groups, the highest proportion of 50% responders, 75% responders, and participants 
achieving  seizure free  status  from  Baseline to  the  Treatment  Period  were  in  the  ≥1  month  to  <4  years 
group compared with the  ≥4 to <16  and ≥16  years age groups. 
Results of the Clinical and Caregiver Global Impression of Change support that study participants improved 
over the course of the study. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory results support that study participants’ 
health-related quality of life remained stable over the course of the  study. 
Supportive study 
Study SP0969: A multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group study 
to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lacosamide  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  with 
epilepsy ≥4 years to <17 years of age  with partial onset seizures  
SP0969  was a randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled trial conducted  at  114  sites in  Europe,  North 
America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region. Paediatric patients (≥4–<17  years of age) were eligible 
if they had a diagnosis of epilepsy with focal (partial onset) seizures, with ≥1  prior EEG and MRI/CT scans 
consistent  with  this  diagnosis.  Additional  inclusion  criteria  were  uncontrolled  focal  seizures  after  an 
adequate  course  of  treatment  (in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator)  with  ≥2  AEDs  (concurrently  or 
sequentially); an average of ≥2 focal seizures per 28 days, with no more than 21 days without seizures in 
the  8-week  period  before entering  the  baseline  period,  and  at  least  2  focal seizures  during  the  8-week 
prospective baseline; and a  stable dose regimen of  1  to  3  AEDs for ≥4  weeks before the  baseline period 
and throughout  the trial. Exclusion criteria included assignment to LCM in a previous trial, convulsive status  
epilepticus (within the previous 2 months); Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; primary generalized epilepsy; mixed 
seizure  disorder;  exclusively  febrile  seizures;  nocturnal  seizures  only;  or  epilepsy  secondary  to  a 
progressive cerebral or neurodegenerative disease.

The enrolled patients (n=343) were randomized (1:1) to adjunctive LCM/placebo. Of the patients, 306 (LCM 
152  of  171  [88.9%];  placebo 154  of  172  [89.5%])  completed treatment.  From baseline to  maintenance, 
percent reduction in focal seizure frequency per 28 days for LCM (n = 170) vs placebo (n = 168) was 31.7%  
(p  = 0.0003).  During maintenance,  median percent reduction in  focal seizure frequency per 28  days was 
51.7%  for LCM  and  21.7%  for placebo. Fifty  percent responder rates (≥50%  reduction)  were 52.9%  and 
33.3%  (OR 2.17,  p = 0.0006). 
It is  noted that  the final  clinical study report SP0969 was  initially submitted  and reviewed by the  CHMP  in 
the procedure Vimpat EMA/H/C/863/P46  028 (CHMP outcome in November 2017). The relevant findings of 
the  study  were  thereafter  summarised  and  reflected  in  the  Product  Information  in  the  variation 
EMEA/H/C/000863/II/0070/G  (CHMP  adoption  in  July  2018).  Adjunctive  LCM  was  efficacious in  reducing 
seizure frequency and  was generally well  tolerated in  children  and adolescents ≥4  years to  <17  years of 
age  (Farkas et  al,  2019).  The  efficacy  data  confirmed the  extrapolation  approach used  for  the  previous 
extension of indication  in the treatment of POS in pediatric patients ≥4  to <16 years of age. 
The  populations in  SP0967  and  SP0969  showed high  similarity in  terms  of pathophysiology,  concomitant 
medical conditions and use of prior/concomitant AEDs. Differences were in the baseline duration, treatment 
duration of LCM,  and efficacy endpoint measures. Exposure to  LCM treatment  was much longer in  SP0969 
than  SP0967 (Maintenance  Period of 10  weeks in  SP0969  vs 1 week in  SP0967). The efficacy endpoint  in 
SP0969  was  the  change  from  Baseline in  seizure frequency  per  28  days, which  was  measured over 10 
weeks of treatment,  allowing longer time  for the  clinical effect to  evolve. In SP0967,  the primary efficacy 
variable was measured over a  much shorter time  based on  72  hours of  continuous  recording video-EEGs 
(with every attempt to obtain at least 48 hours of interpretable recording) 27 days after the Baseline Period, 
allowing the clinical effect a shorter time to evolve.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study SP0967,  a phase 3  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
was  designed to  evaluate the  efficacy, safety and  tolerability  of LCM  as adjunctive  therapy administered 
concomitantly with 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs in children ≥1 month to <4 years of age with POS and currently 
uncontrolled  seizures. Efficacy was  the  primary objective of  assessment, and  the  efficacy variables were 
based  on  video-EEG  recordings,  which  is  recommended  by  the  EMA  guideline  as  a  complementary 
assessment (2018)  and  even as  sufficient  short-term assessment of response in  the  very young  patients 
(2010).  The video-EEG recordings were evaluated locally by the investigator, sub-investigator, or qualified 
designated reader, as well as centrally. 
The treatment  groups may be considered sufficiently balanced as for their  epilepsy and the  seizure types, 
as  well  as  demography  and  the  general  morbidity  and  the  concomitant  medications.  The  results 
unequivocally indicate no increase in efficacy for the outcome variables in LCM users, and the  results were 
consistently supported by all sensitivity analyses. The post hoc analyses of the  interpretation of video-EEG 
data as well  as the  number and classification of seizures revealed a very low level of agreement between 
the local and central readers, which seriously undermined the conclusions that  can be made. Nevertheless, 
as  the  bottom  line,  the  results  do  not  provide  data  in  support  of  increased  efficacy when  LCM  is  used 
concomitantly with  1-3 AEDs in paediatric patients ≥1 month to <4 years of age with currently uncontrolled 
partial-onset epilepsy. 
It  is also notable that  the  number of patients  in  the very young age groups is limited,  with  15  patients  in 
the  age  group >1  month  to ≤6  months,  and 28  patients  in  the  age  group  >6  months  to<1  year. This  is 
important  especially  considering  the  fundamental  question  on  the  similarity  of  pathophysiology  of  POS 
regardless of age, particularly concerning the youngest age group.   
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results provided by the randomized controlled trial SP0967 and the open label extension studies 
do not provide data in favour of superior efficacy of LCM in paediatric patients of the age group ≥1 month 
to  <4  years. Consequently, the  CHMP  is of  the  view  that  the  extension of  indication  cannot  be  based on 
clinical efficacy data. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety overview is based on clinical studies SP0967 with  initially 255 patients, EP0034 with 517 patients  
(195  patients in  the relevant age group), SP847 SP848 with  324  enrolled patients (37  in the  relevant age 
group),  EP0060  with  103  patients  (48  patients  in  the  age group  ≥1 month  to  <8  years of age),  and Pool 
SPX-1 (comprising of patients from SP846, SP848, and EP0060) including 847 patients (258 in the relevant 
age group  with  ages ≥1  month  to  <4  years of age).  In addition  to  these studies,  reference is  made to  a 
retrospective  register  study  EP0147  examining  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  iv.  LCM  loading  dose  in 
neonates (<30  days) and in paediatric patients ≥30  days to <17  years of age.  
The safety observations are focused on the  similarity of the safety profile with  adults and older children as 
well  as absence of unexpected safety concerns in  the  safety database, and  rationale of the  study EP0147 
was to study the safety of loading dose as recorded in off-label paediatric use.  
The  study  SP847  was  a  multicentre,  open-label,  dose-titration  study  investigating  LCM  oral  solution 
(syrup) (2mg/kg/day to up to 12mg/kg/day) as adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients ≥1 month to  ≤17

years of age with  uncontrolled POS, with  the  objectives to  evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of LCM 
when added to a stable dose regimen of 1  to 3 concomitant  AEDs as well as to obtain  preliminary efficacy 
data  on  seizure  frequency.  Plasma  concentrations  of  LCM  and  its  major  metabolite  SPM  12809  were 
determined for characterization of steady-state PK of LCM  and SPM 12809  using popPK methods.  
There were 3  periods in  the  study  (Screening Period, Treatment  Period, and  End-of-Study Period)  with  a 
maximum duration of treatment of up to approximately 13 weeks. Patients in SP847 had the option to enrol 
in  the  long-term,  open-label  study  (SP848).  Five  patient  age  cohorts  with  uncontrolled  POS  on  a  stable 
dose regimen of at least 1 but  no more than 3 AEDs were enrolled. They were to be on each LCM  dose for 
at  least  5  days before the  dose was  titrated  up  to  the  next  dose. After  at  least 3  days on  the  maximum 
recommended dose or the maximum tolerated dose, blood samples were collected for PK analysis. Patients 
who withdrew  from the study prior to completion of the Treatment Period completed an Early Termination 
Visit where blood samples were collected for the maximum tolerated dose achieved by the patient.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no reported deaths among treated patients in studies SP0967 and EP0060. Across all age groups 
(Pool SPX-1) by the clinical  cut-off date, a  total of 6  patients  (0.7%)  had died; of these, 5  deaths (0.6%) 
were  due  to  TEAEs,  and  1  death  was  posttreatment.  No  deaths  were  considered related  to  LCM  by  the  
investigator.  Four deaths  occurred in  patients  in  the age  group >1  month  to  <4  years of age, 3  of  the  4 
deaths occurred during treatment with  LCM. 
•  A patient  died  from status  epilepticus,  cardiac arrest,  and dyspnoea. The patient  entered  EP0034 
and was receiving a dose of LCM 7.1mg/kg/day. The patient  died after 444 days on LCM in EP0034. 
The patient awoke with  a high  fever and subsequently experienced epileptic seizures. The patient, 
cyanotic and in status epilepticus, developed asystole despite treatment, and resuscitation attempts  
were unsuccessful. Relevant medical history included intraventricular haemorrhage, hydrocephalus, 
ventricular drainage, sleep disorder, and muscle hypotonia. Other relevant concomitant medications 
included  VPA,  oxcarbazepine,  nitrazepam,  amoxicillin/clavulanate, 
epinephrine, 
and 
aminophenazone. 
•  A  patient  died  from  pneumonia  aspiration  after  70  days on  LCM  during  participation  in  EP0034, 
having been hospitalized with a serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of sepsis. Other 
TEAEs reported were  diarrhoea and  convulsion. During  the  fatal pneumonia  aspiration event,  the 
patient  received PB,  clobazam, diazepam,  CBZ,  valproate sodium,  PHT,  domperidone, amikacin,

•  A  patient  died  from  influenzal  pneumonia  712  days  after  starting  treatment  with  LCM  during 
participation in EP0034,  having been hospitalized for 11 days. The concomitant  medications at the  
time of the fatal event were valproate magnesium, VPA, lamotrigine, topiramate, and montelukast. 
SAEs 
•  SP0967: Overall, the incidence of serious TEAEs was similar between the LCM and placebo groups. 
In  each  treatment  group,  4  patients  (3.1%)  experienced a  total  of  9  serious TEAEs,  4  of  which 
occurred  in  the  LCM  group  and  5  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  LCM  group,  serious  TEAEs  were 
reported  for  vomiting  (2  patients)  and  convulsion  (2  patients).  Serious  TEAEs  reported  in  the  
placebo group included  pyrexia, upper respiratory infection,  urinary tract  infection,  thermal  burn,

• 
and respiratory failure (1 patient). 
EP0060:  no serious TEAEs were reported. 
Pool SPX-1: by the cut-off date, a total of 172 study patients (20.3%)  experienced 395 treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) which  included 61 patients  (23.6%)  in the  age group ≥1 
month to 4 years of age that experienced 138 treatment-emergent SAEs. The incidences and types 
of serious TEAEs were similar between the  total patients and those ≥1  month to <4 years of age. 
Overall, the most frequently reported serious TEAEs in patients  ≥1 month to <4  years of age were 
convulsion  (11  patients,  4.3%),  status  epilepticus  (7  patients,  2.7%],  pneumonia  (10  patients, 
3.9%),  and  epilepsy (3  patients,  1.2%).  Four  serious TEAEs in  patients  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of 
age were related to study medication: status  epilepticus, abnormal liver function test, hypophagia, 
and epilepsy (1 patient each). All related SAEs were resolved at the time of the clinical cut-off date. 
Drug-related SAEs that led to patient discontinuation  were status epilepticus and liver function test 
abnormal. 
For the subset of study participants ≥1 month to <4 years of age who were exposed to LCM for ≥1 
calendar year,  the  most  frequently  reported  serious TEAEs  were  pneumonia  (8  patients,  5.9%), 
and convulsion and status  epilepticus (5 patients, 3.7%,  each) 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
•  SP0967: two  patients, both in  LCM group, experienced a TEAE leasing to  discontinuation

• 
• 
EP0060:  no TEAEs leading to discontinuation  were reported. 
Pool SPX-1: A total of 46 patients (5.4%) experienced a total of 59 TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
in the last study in  which they participated. Among them,  a total  of 10  patients (3.9%)  had a total 
of 10 TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the ≥1 month to <4 years age group. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation  in study participants  ≥1 month to  <4 years of age were 
convulsion  and  status  epilepticus  (2  participants  each).  Dizziness leading  to  discontinuation  was 
not observed in study participants ≥1  month to <4 years of age. 
Related  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  patients  <4  years  of  age  were  convulsion  (2  study 
patients),  rash, somnolence, status epilepticus, and sinus bradycardia (1 patient  each). All related 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation were resolved at the time of clinical cut-off date with the exception 
of  convulsion  and  sinus  bradycardia (1  patient),  and  all  were  considered nonserious, apart  from 
status epilepticus.

The majority of  patients  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of  age had the  event  within  3  months  of  starting 
the study (7 patients). 
TEAEs of special interest 
Growth, neurodevelopment, behaviour and  endocrinology-related 
•  SP0967:  in LCM  group, aggression was experienced by two  patients  in  the ≥1  month  to <4  years 
age group. Both occurred during the titration period at onset of dose 6 mg/kg/day, were considered 
mild in intensity,  and both were considered related to study drug. Neither resolved.  
Developmental delay was  reported in  a  patient  at  onset of  dose 8 mg/kg/day  during  the  titration 
period. The TEAE was considered mild in severity and not related to  study drug. 
• 
• 
No patients  were reported as having suicidal ideation, behaviour, or attempts. 
EP0060:  no TEAEs related to this area were reported. 
Pool SPX-1: by the clinical cut-off, 4 patients (1.6%) experienced 4 TEAEs of aggression. They were 
considered mild or moderate in intensity, and not related to study drug. One patient (0.4%) had a 
psychotic disorder that was considered mild and not related to study medication. 
Cardiological TEAEs 
•  SP0967:  no clinically  relevant changes were observed in mean or  median ECG findings  that  were 
considered related to  LCM.  Sinus bradycardia was reported in  1 patient  during treatment  and one 
in the transition  period.  
•  SP848: similar small mean changes across each age group for Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTcB), 
PR  duration,  and  QRS duration  were  detected,  and  they  were not  considered clinically  relevant. 
There was  no  evidence  of  QT,  QTcB,  or  QTcF  prolongation  following  treatment  with  LCM.  Fifteen 
TEAEs related to 12 lead ECG findings were reported by 10  study participants, but  none of these in 
the age group ≥1 month  to <4  years: 4 instances of first-degree AV block in  3 patients  (0.6%),  3 
with  QT  prolongation  (0.6%).  The  TEAEs  were considered mild  or  moderate in  intensity  and  not 
serious but  possibly related to study medication. 
• 
• 
• 
EP0060: similar small mean changes between baseline and final visit for PR interval, QRS duration, 
QTcF and QTcB, which were not considered clinically relevant. No ECG-related TEAEs were reported.  
EP0034: similar small mean changes between baseline and final visit for PR interval, QRS duration, 
QTcF  and QTcB, which  were not  considered clinically relevant. One patient  in  the  group <4  years 
of age  had a  TEAE of  Brugada syndrome reported on  day 98  on  LCM  dose 10  mg/kg/day. It  was 
considered mild in intensity  and not  related to study  drug.  
Pool SPX-1: Seven patients  (2.7%)  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of age experienced 9  events of  status 
epilepticus;  all  were  treatment-emergent  SAEs,  either  moderate  or  severe  in  intensity,  and 
resolved. The events were considered to be not related to study medication in 6 patients and related 
in  1  patient.  TEAEs  of epilepsy occurred in  6  patients  (2.3%)  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of  age, and 
they  were  considered serious for  3  patients  (1.2%),  no  events  led  to  discontinuation,  no  events 
were  considered  related  to  study  medication,  and  with  the  exception  of  1  participant,  all  were 
resolved or resolving at the time of the clinical cut-off date. TEAEs of partial seizures with secondary 
generalization occurred in  1 patient  ≥1 month  to  <4 years of age. The  event was  not serious, led 
to  discontinuation,  was  not  considered related  to  study  medication,  and  was  not  resolved at  the  
time of the  clinical cut-off  date. TEAEs of complex partial seizures and partial seizures occurred in

4  patients  ≥1  month  to  <4  years of  age  each  (1.6%).  The  AEs  of  complex partial  seizures and 
partial seizures were considered serious for 1  patient (0.4%)  and 4  patients (1.6%),  respectively; 
no  events led  to  discontinuation.  Overall, TEAEs  of  simple partial  seizures occurred  in  2  patients 
(0.8%)  ≥1  month  to <4  years of age.  The TEAEs of  simple partial  seizures were not  serious, did 
not  lead  to  discontinuation,  were  not  considered  related  to  study  medication,  and  were  not 
recovered/resolved at the time of the clinical cut-off date. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no consistent  or clinically relevant changes from Baseline after onset of treatment  were observed 
in  mean haematology or clinical  chemistry values across studies  (SP0967,  SP848,  EP0034,  EP0060).  The 
incidence of TEAEs related to abnormal haematology or clinical chemistry values was low. None were serious 
or led to  discontinuation.  
Safety of the loading dose for initiation of treatment 
The  study  EP0147  was  a  retrospective cohort  study  with  the  objective  to  assess  the  paediatric  safety 
profile  of  clinically  administered  intravenous  LCM,  comparing  higher-than-recommended  to  the  
recommended dosage  in  paediatric  patients  including  neonatal  cases as  a  group.  The  study  utilized  an 
electronic  healthcare  record  data  from  a  paediatric  learning  health  system  data  network  (PEDSnet)  to 
estimate the  incidence of a number of selected medical events of interest  (for 8 of System Organ Classes 
[SOC]  and  3  of  Standardized  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  Queries[SMQ])  in  paediatric 
patients  after treatment  with  higher  than  recommended iv.  LCM  doses,  compared to  paediatric patients  
treated  with  the  recommended  initial  or  maintenance  iv.  LCM  dose.  The  baseline period  was  at  least  3 
months  before  the  qualifying  treatment  episode (for  patients  less than  3  months  of  age, the  time  since 
birth  was  considered),  and  the  follow-up  period  was  a  maximum  of  37  days  from  the  index  date.  The 
episode of care concluded on discharge from the acute care (home, post-acute care, another hospital), 37 
days after the index event, or at  death. The end  date was the  last day of the  follow-up period. In case of 
multiple episodes of care, only the first one was included in the analysis. Total of 686 cases aged ≥1 month 
to  <17  years were identified, with  471  patients  in the  recommended-dose cohort and 215  patients  in the  
higher-loading-dose cohort, as well  as 28 neonatal  patients,  with  16  in the  recommended-dose and 12  in 
the higher-loading-dose cohorts.  
The  majority of  neonatal  patients  weighed  <4  kg  (19  patients,  67.9%).  The  dominant  weight  categories 
among the older patients  were 4-10 kg in patients  30≥days to  <1 year, 10-20 kg in patients  from 1 to <4 
years, 20-30 kg in patients  from 4 to <12  years, and ≥50 kg in patients from 12 to <17  years of age. 
The crude incidence rates of AEs did not  differ between recommended-dose (RD) and higher-loading-dose 
cohorts  (LD):  among patients  aged ≥1  month  to  <17  years, it  was  in  RD cohort  64.44  per 1000  person 
days (95%  CI: 55.88-73.95)  and in the LD cohort 50.00  per 1000  person days (95%  CI: 39.82-61.98).  In 
the neonates, the incidence rate of AEs in the RD cohort was 36.04  per 1000 person days (95% CI: 15.56-
71.01)  and in the LD cohort 8.85 per 1000 person days (95% CI: 1.07-31.97). 
There were no  differences in  the  crude incidence rates by  AE diagnostic  categories apart  from a  two-fold 
incidence of rash in  the LD cohort  compared with  the  RD cohort (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2.11;  95%  
CI:  1.02,  4.38).  In  addition,  the  death  rates  were  similar  and  fairly  high  due  to  the  critically  ill  patient 
population  and  not  attributed  to  LCM.  It  is  noted  that  7  cases with  pancreatitis  were  recorded in  the  RD 
group. This  was discussed in  the  procedure EMEA/H/C/000863  P46 040,  no conclusion  regarding a causal 
relationship could be made and it  was agreed that  a cumulative review will be presented the  next Periodic 
Safety Update Reports (PSUR).

Post marketing experience 
During the period from 29 Aug 2008 to 29  Feb 2020, a total  of 428  cases (77 serious and 351 nonserious) 
were identified  from the UCB Global Safety database in patients ≥1  month to <4  years of age. 
A review of all cases did not  reveal concerns specific to  the use  of LCM  in patients  ≥1  month  to <4  years 
of age compared with the known safety profile of LCM in patients ≥4 years to <17 years of age. The review 
considered fatal cases (including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) and cases reported with AEs related 
to topics of interest such as cardiac conduction and ECG-related events; syncope and loss of consciousness; 
suicidality-related  events;  hepatotoxicity-related  events;  dizziness  and  ataxia;  worsening  of  seizures  or 
emergence  of  new  seizures  type;  lack  of  efficacy;  multiorgan  hypersensitivity  and  drug  reaction  with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS); severe cutaneous adverse reactions; fall and injuries; drug 
abuse; and potential  long-term effect on growth,  neurodevelopment, and puberty. 
A  review  of  other  medically  important  events  (pancreatitis,  renal  failure  and  renal  impairment,  drug 
interaction  and food interaction, and  blood and lymphatic system disorders) also did  not identify  any new 
safety concerns related to  the  use of LCM  in patients  ≥1  month  to  <4 years of age. No particular pattern 
was identified in specific epilepsy syndromes. 
A cumulative review of relevant publications  describing the  use of LCM  in  patients ≥1 month  to  <4  years 
of age did not  identify a new safety concern. 
In conclusion, the  cumulative post-marketing LCM  analysis indicates that  the  safety profile in  patients ≥1 
month to  <4 years of age is consistent with  the known safety profile of LCM. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data provided satisfies the following  Guideline requirements: the safety profile in children aged 
≥1  month  to  <4  years should  be compared to  the  safety in  the  older paediatric age group  of  ≥4  to  <16 
years and  the  safety  database  in  paediatric  patients  should  include  at  least  100  children  exposed for  at 
least 12 months. On the whole, the observations do not appear significantly different between the youngest 
age  group  ≥1  month  to  4  years and  older  children  and  the  existing  fluctuations  may  be  explained  by 
heterogeneity between the studies  as well as the populations. The spectrum of TEAEs by organ systems is 
largely as expected and consistent  with  the known safety profile of LCM.   
The  TEAEs of  specific interest  including  those  concerning cognitive  development,  growth  and  maturation 
were not overrepresented in the any group in the safety database. These safety concerns are nevertheless 
of specific significance in the youngest and the  least mature paediatric patient.  
The  safety data  have  not  given  rise  to  unforeseen safety  concerns.  The  7  cases  with  pancreatitis  in  the 
retrospective register-based data  of  the  study EP0147  have been noted  and,  as agreed in  the  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000863  P46 040, no conclusion regarding a causal relationship could be made and it was agreed 
that  a cumulative review will  be presented the next PSUR. 
Interim  clinical study  reports  for EP0034  and  SP848  were prepared using  a clinical  cut-off  date  of  06  Jul 
2020.  The  number  of  study  participants  aged ≥1  month  to  <4  years  in  the  2  ongoing  long-term  safety 
extension studies, SP848 and EP0034,  were 38 and  225, respectively. The MAH  has provided data  for the  
requested age subgroups (≥1 to <6 months, ≥6 months to <1 year, ≥1 to <2 years, and ≥2 to <4 years). 
The  number  of  subjects  were  limited  in  the  two  youngest  age  subgroups;  ≥1  to  <6  months  (N=9),  ≥6 
months to <1  year (N=30).  There was no new safety finding in  the age group ≥1 month  to <4 years

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  CHMP  agrees  that  the  available safety  data  are  sufficient  to  support  the  present  extension  of  the 
indication for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment  of POS. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of  this group  of variations, including  the extension of indication  variation, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.8, 5.1,  5.2, 6.3 and 6.5  of the SmPC have been updated. The labelling and the Package Leaflet have 
been updated accordingly. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  implement  editorial  updates  and  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current 
Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
For Vimpat, the  WSA has submitted  a full  user test  for the syrup and a bridging report for the  film-coated 
tablets and the solution  for infusion. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet show that the package 
leaflet  meets  the  criteria  for  readability  as  set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the  readability  of  the  label  and 
package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The bridging report has also been found acceptable. 
For Lacosamide UCB, as the product information is identical/strongly similar to  Vimpat (except for product 
specific details e.g. product name), no bridging statement was submitted.  This was found acceptable. 
2.9.  Additional Expert Consultation 
During the assessment procedure, the  CHMP convened an ad hoc expert group (AHEG) in  order to discuss 
a number of questions including the extrapolation of efficacy data in POS from the adults to the younger (1 
month-2  year) paediatric  population,  the  extrapolation of  efficacy in  isolated POS to  POS  with  coexisting 
seizure types, the validity of the study SP0967 results and impact of the study outcome on the extrapolation 
discussion and the  appropriateness of EEG-video recordings as primary endpoint.  
The details of the  questions and the  summary of the  expert group discussion is detailed hereafter: 
GENERAL 
1.  Is  it  possible  to  extrapolate  efficacy  data  in  partial  onset  seizures  (POS)  from  adults  to 
children aged  ≥1  month to  <2  years  based  on  similar drug  exposure  only, considering the 
immaturity  of  the  developing  brain,  potentially  different  pathophysiology,  and  different 
clinical presentation (POS  together with other seizure types) in this age  group? 
Whether  efficacy  can  be  established  based  solely  on  extrapolation  (without  data  from  trial)  was  not 
considered a straightforward question  and the  opinion of the  experts was clearly split.  
•  Some  experts  agreed  that  extrapolation  is  possible  for  this  age  group  based  on  the  arguments 
presented  by  the  Applicant.  Some  experts  acknowledged  that  presentation  of  the  seizure  is  not  a 
relevant aspect related to efficacy. Additionally, it  was noted  that both  drugs are anti-seizures and not 
anti-epileptogenic drugs and,  in this  regard, pathophysiology of seizures is considered to be similar in 
children from 1 month  to 2 years and in children from 2 to 4 years. An expert noted that  one exception 
could  be West  syndrome. Another  expert commented that  waiting  for  a perfect  study  may delay the 
access for  the drug  and that  extrapolation could be a  pragmatic approach provided we  are reassured 
on the safety profile.  
•  Other experts agreed that  extrapolation is possible but  based on scientific theoretical grounds that  are 
considered of a rather low scientific level by these experts. Therefore, they must be considered only as 
supportive  arguments in  addition  to  data  from trials,  which  are  definitely needed.  One  expert noted 
that, paradoxically, extrapolation could be easier for situations without  studies (e.g. Brivaracetam) than 
for situations for which we have studies showing negative results (Lacosamide). Another expert did not

believe  that  extrapolation  was  possible  because  even  if  the  physiopathological  manifestations  are 
considered to  be similar, impact on  the brain may be different, due to  a different brain developmental 
status.  For  this  expert, this  argument  is  also applicable for refusing extrapolation  from 2-4  years, an 
argument  shared to  some  extend also  by another  member. A  couple of  experts noted  that  posology 
(exposure drug) could be a relevant aspect because PK profile could be different in small children which 
may impact safety (e.g. metabolism may be slower exposing children to higher doses). It was clarified 
by  the  Rapporteurs to  the  experts  that  this  aspect  has  been considered  in  the  assessment and  that 
extrapolation is considered under comparable exposure levels.    
The two  patients´ representatives were convinced that pathophysiology could be similar but  still they have 
concerns specially regarding to the impact on neurodevelopmental status, and thus still consider that well-
designed clinical trials are needed.  One of the patient’s representatives was also concerned about the lack 
of  effect  in  contrast  with  potential  risk  of  adverse events,  especially  on  children  with  severe  epileptic 
syndromes.   
2.  Can efficacy in isolated POS  be extrapolated  to efficacy in POS with coexisting seizure types, 
which is an epileptic syndrome more often present in the younger age  group?  
Similarly, experts were split  as  there were some experts who  would  not  agree on  extrapolation approach 
as  a  sole  strategy  to  get  confirmatory  evidence on  efficacy.  Taken this  into  consideration,  experts also 
express the following views:  
While  there is a risk of aggregation of  other seizures with  certain drugs, overall experts do not  think  that 
the  existence  of  other  seizure  does  modifies  the  response  of  brivaracetam  or  lacosamide  on  seizures. 
However, it  was noted that  when there  are global and focal seizures in  children aged 1 month  to 2  years, 
it  is possible that  these  patients,  most likely without  a diagnosis, suffer from an epileptic  encephalopathy 
and likely a refractory epilepsy. As per regards of refractory epilepsy, it was noted that except for the auto-
limitated seizures, young children may become refractory quite soon and several changes in the medication 
is needed. The prevalence of refractory epilepsy is about the same in both groups (up to 30%  as reported 
by one of the patients representative). Therefore, it was agreed that the need for new drugs is the same in 
the two  age groups. 
A  couple  of  experts noted  that  currently  prescription  is  not  based  on  precision  medicine (specific  to  the  
syndrome) and  therefore, the  risk of  prescribing an  ineffective  drug  already sin  the  clinical  practice  and 
having another drug could be helpful for the  management of seizures in these patients.   
VIMPAT/LACOSAMIDE 
3.  In the  placebo-controlled SP0967 study  in children ≥1 month to <4 years  of age  with POS, 
the  efficacy  of lacosamide  was  not  demonstrated.  Please  discuss the  validity  of the  study 
results,  possible explanations  of  the  failure  to  show efficacy,  and  the  impact  of the  study 
outcome on the extrapolation  discussion. 
Experts fully  agreed that  the  study  was poorly designed. First,  study  population  likely included refractory 
patients  with  severe seizures -  it  was  noted  that  there  were difficulties  in  the  recruitment-  suggesting  a 
potential  selection  bias.  Second,  another  relevant  concern  was  the  large  inter-rate  variability  in  the 
interpretation of video-EEG that  could be linked with several reasons including the  severity of the  seizures 
(ictal  but  also inter-ictal activity  that  makes the  diagnosis of an individual  seizure more difficult),  the  fact 
that  EEG-video is  not  routinely  used  in  the  clinical  practice  and  provided training  of  investigators  before 
study onset was considered insufficient, the too short timeframe of EEG-video recording (48h), taking into 
consideration  the  well-known  periodicity  of  epileptic  seizures  (patients  have  good  and  bad  periods 
regardless the medication). One expert noted that design should have included just a single central reading. 
Third,  some experts considered that  the video-EGG was not  included  in the  design in  an appropriate way 
(see detail sin  answer to  Q5). They expressed the  view that  EGG-video is useful  to validate seizures  that 
are difficult to identify clinically (e.g. small children) but should not be used as the primary efficacy endpoint, 
which  should better rely on a clinical outcome based on diaries. Finally,  the design should have taken into  
consideration the type of seizure at entry. Based on the duration of the seizures, the duration of video-EGG 
recording could have been tailored to  better capture the seizures.  
As per regards to the impact on the extrapolation discussion, the group was also split. Among experts prone 
to accept extrapolation approach, some declared that , the negative results impact their view, while some 
declared that their conviction was not modified, as the poor quality of the study  make them  to consider it 
as inconclusive, so that  it  could not  be used to make a decision. Finally, experts already disapproving the  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 59/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
extrapolation approach, considered the study failure as an additional argument for the need of adequately 
designed  trials.  One  patient  representative  was  doubtful  and  negative  results  clearly  impacted  the 
perspective of the other patient representative.  
4.  Please  discuss the  appropriateness  of  EEG-video  recordings as  primary  endpoint  and  the 
implications of the study outcome with regards to the  claim of the applicant that lacosamide 
may  be considered efficacious in children ≥1 month to <4 years of age with POS.   
Experts agreed that  video-EEG could be integrated  in a study but  there was a consensus that  the  primary 
endpoint  should  not  rely  solely  on  EEG-video  recording.  Some  experts  insisted  again  that  EGG-video 
recording could be better useful to validate seizures that are difficult to identify clinically (e.g. neonates) or 
in in situations with  many of seizures (e.g. >100).  An expert noted that video-EGG recording could be also 
proposed as a primary endpoint  for drugs targeting specific syndromes such as West Syndrome. 
One expert mentioned that  a  recent article proposed a better  protocol for using  EEG-video as outcome  in 
clinical  trial  (Auvin  et  al.,  2019,’Novel  study  design  to  assess the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  antiseizure 
medications  for  focal-onset  seizures  in  infants  and  young  children:  A  consensus  document  from  the 
regulatory task force and the pediatric commission of the International Leaugue against Epilepsy (ILAE), in 
collaboration  with  the  Pediatric  Epilepsy  Research  Consortium  (PERC)’  published  in  Epilepsia  Open  in 
2019;4:537–543).  For most experts, regarding focal onset seizures, frequency of seizures based on diaries 
remains  the  best  approach  for  primary  endpoint  and  seizures  should  be  pre-specified  in  the  protocol. 
Additionally, it was insisted that  diaries capture clinical manifestations closer to the real world. 
Patient’s representatives agree with  the experts on this aspect. Additionally, the patient´s  burden of EEG-
video recording is substantial  as reported by one patient´s representative. 
2.10.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
2.11.  Therapeutic Context 
2.11.1.  Disease or condition 
Partial-onset  epilepsies  are  more  common  (approximately  57%),  and  generalized  epilepsies  constitute 
roughly  one  third,  and  in  one-tenth  of  epilepsies  the  classification  remains  uncertain.  Partial  epilepsy  is 
associated with  a local  abnormality affecting  a  neuronal network  within  one hemisphere. Focal  or  partial 
seizures are traditionally classified according to the patient’s level of awareness and the first most prominent 
motor  or nonmotor  features of  the  seizure. The  level of  awareness leads to  three classes: simple  partial 
(awareness not impaired), complex partial (awareness impaired), or partial seizures evolving to secondarily 
generalized seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic, myoclonic). The etiologies fall into six defined categories: 
structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, or unknown. 
The incidence peaks in the  first year of life and has been estimated to be within the range of 56.8-318 per 
100  000.  Later  in  the  childhood  the  incidence rate  declines, but  another  peak is  late  in  life.  At  any rate, 
epilepsy in  childhood  is a  highly  significant  and  highly variable form of  neurological morbidity  with  many 
risks including  a higher risk of death and neuropsychiatric disorders. The clinical presentation of POS may 
be  subjective,  objective,  or  both;  convulsive  or  nonconvulsive;  brief  or  prolonged;  inconspicuous  or 
dramatic and bizarre. The subjective and/or objective symptoms observed in POS depend on the functional 
organization at the site of ictal origin and/or sites of propagation. Thus, symptoms may be motor, sensory, 
mental, emotional, cognitive, or linguistic  (alone or in various combinations). 
2.11.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pharmacological  antiepileptic  therapy  is  needed  for  the  majority  of  patients.  The  range  of  available 
medicines has widened considerably during the last decades, and the newer AEDs provide different spectra, 
mechanisms of action and PK properties. Treatment is commonly started with  monotherapy, and it may be 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 60/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
necessary to try alternatives if the therapy response appears insufficient, or resort to adjunctive therapies. 
Despite the  various AED options, roughly one third  of patients  do not  achieve an adequate seizure control. 
There is therefore a need for more effective and better tolerated AEDs. 
2.11.3.  Main clinical studies 
2.12.  Favourable effects 
Extrapolation  of  adult  efficacy to  paediatric  patient  on  the  basis  of  previous  PK  data  has  been  applied 
previously  to  the  age  group  ≥4  years  to  older,  supported  by  weight-based  dosing  adaptations.  In  this 
application, the extrapolation concept is applied further in attempt to extrapolate efficacy data from adults 
and  older paediatric patients  to  the  younger in  the  age  group ≥1  month  to  <4  years. Apart  from the  PK 
model  for  LCM,  the  application  refers  to  efficacy data  from  three  studies,  of  which  one  is  a  completed 
randomized  controlled  trial  intended  as  pivotal  and  two  ongoing  open-label  studies,  and  a  supportive 
randomized controlled study in paediatric patients  aged ≥4  years to < 17 years.   
Study  SP0967  is  the  completed  Phase  3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive therapy in study participants  
with  epilepsy ≥1  month  to <4  years of age with  uncontrolled POS. It  enrolled 255  patients,  of which  242 
completed the  study. Most  patients  were ≥2 to  <4  years (134,  52.5%),  less than fifth  were <1  year (47, 
18.5%).  partial-onset  seizure  frequency  for  infants  aged  ≥1month  to  ≤6months  was  based  on 
electrographic seizures only, whereas POS frequency for children aged >6months to <4years was based on 
electrographic  seizures  with  an  accompanying  clinical  correlate.  No  separate  clinical  seizure  data  were 
collected in the study, which is understandable given the short duration (7 days) of the blinded maintenance 
period part of the study.  
The primary efficacy variable of ≥50% responder rate compared to baseline was 41.4% for LCM, 37.5% for 
placebo,  or  the  mean  change  in  daily  frequency  of  electrographic POS  7.14  in  LCM  vs.  7.83  in  placebo 
groups (p=0.69).  The difference of change was not  considered clinically meaningful and is not statistically  
significant.  
Study  EP0034  is  an  open-label extension  to  the  study  SP0967  (as  well  as SP9069)  an ongoing  Phase  3, 
multicenter, open-label, long-term study to investigate the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive therapy 
in paediatric study participants  (≥1 month  to ≤17  years of age) with  POS. This study  lacks a control arm. 
Of the  517  patients,  195  are <4  years of  age. The interim  efficacy data is  diary-based, so comparison is 
not available for the ages <4  years.  
Study SP848 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label study to determine safety, tolerability, and efficacy of long-
term oral LCM as adjunctive therapy in children (≥1  month to ≤18 years of age) with epilepsy, including 37 
patients  ≥1 month  to <4  years of age. This study also lacks a control arm. The overall proportion of 50%  
and  75%  responders from  baseline to  treatment  were 53.7%  and  40.4%,  and  the  highest  proportion  of 
responders were in the youngest group of patients ≥1 month to <4 years of age compared to older groups. 
Study  SP0969 provides supportive evidence: A Phase 3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive therapy in subjects 
with  epilepsy ≥4  years to  <17  years  of  age  with  uncontrolled  POS.  LCM  group  experienced a  31.72%  
reduction in seizure frequency, and a statistically significantly higher rate of patients experiencing a ≥50% 
reduction in POS (primary endpoint)  was 52.9% vs. 33.3%.

2.13.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal study SP0967 failed to show an increase in efficacy when LCM  was used concomitantly with 1-
3  antiepileptic drugs  in paediatric patients  ≥1  month  to <4  years of  age with  currently uncontrolled POS. 
Therefore, the efficacy of LCM is extrapolated from the adult population to the paediatric population between 
2-4 years old based on presumed similar pathophysiology and PK/PD relationship. This, however, gives rise 
to  some  uncertainties  regarding  the  precise  metrics  of  efficacy.  Extrapolation  of  efficacy  in  adjunctive 
therapy of POS as established in adults is proposed by the MAH, with support of clinical pharmacology data. 
Similar  exposure  as  in  adults  and  dose  recommendations  are  supported  with  popPK  modelling  and 
simulation.   However, in order to  allow for an extrapolation based on only a PK bridge (similar exposure), 
the AHEG did not consider that the pathophysiology in patients <2 years of age is sufficiently similar to that 
of adults. 
With regards to differences in disease between children younger than 2 years of age and adults, it is unclear 
whether efficacy in isolated POS, as more commonly seen in adults, may be extrapolated to efficacy in POS 
with coexisting seizure types, which is an epileptic syndrome more often present in the younger age group.  
Regarding the EEG-video recordings, the post hoc analyses revealed a methodological issue with a very low 
agreement  between  the  local  and  central  reader  interpretations,  dramatically  lowering  the  inter-rater 
reliability  of the  interpretation  of  seizure counts  and  types and  identified  as a  potential  underlying cause 
for  the  inability  to  directly  demonstrate clinical  efficacy. The  appropriateness of  EEG-video recordings as 
primary endpoint  and  the  implications  of the  study  outcome with  regards to  the  claim that  LCM  may be 
considered efficacious in children ≥1 month  to <2 years was discussed at the AHEG.  
The  AHEG  considered  the  study  poorly  designed  and  that  EEG-video  was  not  an  appropriate  primary 
endpoint.  In  addition,  the  experts  were  not  able  to  disregard  the  study  outcome  when  considering 
extrapolation of efficacy to this  age group. In summary, while the assay sensitivity of the trial is uncertain, 
the failure to show an effect results in uncertainties about the extent of benefit, particularly in the  younger 
paediatric population. 
The proposed weight-based dose adaptations are based on simulations from popPK model and subsequent 
exposure matching  between  adult  and  paediatric  exposure levels.  Despite  the  limitations  of  the  final  PK 
model, the proposed dosing regimen results in similar exposure levels in paediatric patients and adults. 
2.14.  Unfavourable effects 
According  to  the  EMA  guideline,  the  normative  size  for  a  safety  database  should  be  greater  than  100 
patients with  at least one calendar year of follow-up  data.  
The  pre-requisite size  of  the  safety  database is  reasonably  fulfilled.  The  collected  safety  data  within  the 
study SP0967 is within expected frame with respect to rates of SAE and TEAE incidences and similar in LCM 
and placebo groups. The most commonly reported TEAEs in the LCM group were consistent with the known 
safety profile of the  drug in  adults and children >4  years of age, and no unforeseen safety concerns were 
raised. Safety data available in paediatric patients younger than  2 years of age is however limited. 
The numbers of TEAEs with specific interest in this paediatric group (growth, neurodevelopment, behaviour 
and endocrinology-related; cardiological; epileptic phenomena) did not give rise to new concerns. 
The study  EP0147 was  a retrospective cohort study  which used electronic health  record data to  study the  
safety of  LCM  loading  doses in  paediatric  patients,  comparing  treatment  with  higher  than  recommended 
dosage to  treatment  with  recommended dosage. Of  the  total  of  714  eligible  patients,  686  patients  were 
aged ≥1  month to <17 years, and 28 patients were aged <30 days. The crude incidences of TEAEs did not 
differ  between  the  groups  apart  from  rash,  which  had  a  two-fold  incidence  in  the  loading  dose  group 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 62/65 
 
 
 
 
compared with the recommended dose group. There were 7 deaths reported, 2 of these in the loading dose 
group, and the deaths were not deemed associated with LCM. A finding of 7 cases of pancreatitis was noted 
previously (procedure P46 040)  and no conclusion regarding a causal relationship between LCM treatment 
and pancreatitis could be made. 
2.15.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety of the loading dose seems reasonable in light of the retrospective data collected within the study 
EP0147, but the nature of the study sets limits to drawing firm conclusions from the data. The high mortality 
rate reflects the critically ill  patient  group and was  not associated with  LCM.  However, it  is noted that  the  
number of patients was lower in the loading-dose group (31.3%),  and the number of patients was very low 
in the neonate group, precluding firm conclusions. 
The safety profile seems acceptable in the data provided, but there is remaining uncertainty concerning the 
long-term  effects,  especially concerning  neurocognitive  development,  growth  and  maturation,  which  are 
crucial especially in  the  youngest and  least  mature patients.  The  interim  data from  long-term  study  and 
post-marketing  safety  data  give  some  reassurance  that  there  are  little  negative  effects  related  to 
neurocognitive development, neuropsychiatric disorders, growth and maturation in  children. The risks are 
also appropriately listed  in  the  RMP  as  missing information,  with  agreed risk minimization  measures and 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
2.16.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
2.16.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The MAH  has performed a double blinded randomised clinical study in children ≥1 month to <4 years of age 
with  uncontrolled POS. This failed to demonstrate the  efficacy of LCM.   
Nonetheless,  the  MAH  proposes  that  the  efficacy  of  LCM  in  adjunctive  treatment  of  POS in  children  ≥1 
month  to  <4  years of  age  may be  inferred  by  extrapolation  from studies  performed in  adolescents  and 
adults. Dosing regimens based on body weight have been proposed on the basis of PK modelling.  
According to  the EMA  Epilepsy guideline,  extrapolation based on  PK bridging  is accepted down  to 4  years 
of age. In the scientific advice, discussions have opened up for extrapolation down to 2 years of age, based 
on the available scientific literature.  
In line with  the scientific advice, based on available scientific understanding and similarity of disease in the 
populations, extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children above 2 years of age based on similar exposure 
is considered acceptable. The safety profile in the  proposed paediatric population  appears similar  to  what 
is observed in adults and is acceptable. Consequently, the CHMP  agrees that the  B/R risk is positive in the 
children above 2 years of age. 
Due to limitations  in  the  PK/PD model and uncertainties  about the  similarity of pathophysiology given the  
lack of maturation of the CNS, the extrapolation of efficacy from adult to paediatrics ≥1 month to <2 years 
of age is however not supported. 
The CHMP convened an AHEG on the 7th of October to discuss whether an extension of indication to children 
below 2 years of age could be based on the above arguments. The AHEG was split in their views regarding 
whether an extrapolation of efficacy may be based on similar drug exposure only and there were views that 
efficacy data from a well-designed study was needed for this  age group as well.  
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/99116/2022 
Page 63/65 
 
 
 
 
The AHEG was also split in their view of the impact of the negative study results of SP0967 on the possibility 
to base an extension of indication on extrapolation but  could not disregard these negative results. 
In summary, the discussion held by the AHEG did not provide clear support to the extrapolation of efficacy 
based similar drug exposure only. In order to impact the CHMP position regarding extrapolation of efficacy 
from  adults  to  the  paediatric  population  below  2  years  of  age,  there  was  not  sufficient  strength  and 
consistency of  arguments for  the  extrapolation whereas substantial  uncertainties  remain for the  younger 
population. 
The  proposed  dosing  recommendations  are  based  on  simulated  exposure matching  between  paediatric 
patients  and adult patients. Despite some discrepancies between the  exposure reference intervals used in 
the  two  paediatric  extensions  of  indication  procedures, and  some limitations  of  the  final  PK  model,  the 
proposed dosing recommendation results in similar exposure levels across all weight  and age groups.  
2.16.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  CHMP  agrees that  the  extrapolated  benefit  of  Vimpat  as  monotherapy  or  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  
treatment  of  POS with  or  without  secondary generalisation in  children  from 2  years to  4  years of age  is 
considered established and outweigh  the risks.  
It  is  also  agreed that  the  extrapolation of  efficacy to  children  aged ≥1  month  to  <2  years has  not  been 
established.  Therefore, the  CHMP  cannot  recommend an  extension  of  the  Vimpat  POS  indication  to  this  
younger paediatric population. 
2.17.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vimpat/Lacosamide UCB is for the extension of indication in children from 2 years of age 
is positive.

1.  Background 
This signal was triggered by the Swedish Medical Products Agency following the circulation of 
preliminary results dated 5th October 2021 of a study entitled” SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and risk of 
pericarditis and myocarditis: Nordic nationwide cohort study of 20 million individuals”. 
These analyses are undertaken within a request from the Swedish government to the Medical Products 
Agency of in depth safety evaluation of covid-19 vaccines. 
The attached report is based on a meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been followed specifically due to the previous signal of these events. 
2.  Initial evidence 
2.1.  Signal validation  
The preliminary analyses show that the occurrence of myocarditis is more frequent after the second 
vaccine dose, than after the first, and in younger men. Analyses are ongoing to further characterize 
these risks, which include similar analyses of pericarditis. 
The previous PRAC recommendation was mainly based on data from spontaneous reporting. The new 
data, based on national population registers, linked to vaccination and health care registries in the 
respective countries, contribute with new information regarding the magnitude of risk for the two 
respective vaccines, including in different age strata. 
Prompt evaluation on the need for updates on e.g. the product information for these respective 
vaccines is proposed. 
It should also be noted that these data can be important for ongoing vaccination campaigns. 
2.2.  Signal confirmation  
A signal on Spikevax and myocarditis/pericarditis was evaluated and concluded earlier this year. At 
that time, the signal evaluation was based upon spontaneous reports. In addition to a DHPC and also a 
request to update the RMP, the procedure resulted in an update of the product information to add a 
warning on the risk of development of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination: 
Current SmPC 4.4: Myocarditis and pericarditis  
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Spikevax.  
These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men.  Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and 
pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. Healthcare 
professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees should be 
instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or 
pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following 
vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Current SmPC 4.8: Myocarditis, Pericarditis with a frequency “Not known” 
Meanwhile, a Nordic collaboration has performed a study on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and the risk of 
pericarditis and myocarditis in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, based on interlinked national 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax - COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)

Page 4/5 
 
 
 
registers with information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, hospital diagnoses of myocarditis or 
pericarditis, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive infections. 
Preliminary results from this study, dated 5th October 2021, has been shared and the preliminary main 
conclusions regarding Moderna (Spikevax) in a 28 day risk window is: 
-  2nd dose of Spikevax (both homologous and heterologous schedules) is strongly associated 
with myocarditis in the general population and in men 18-39 (14 and 28 excess cases 
28d/100k for homologous and heterologous schedules in men 18-39 years, respectively). 
- 
Estimates in men 18-39 yrs are far from precise but are consistent over countries 
-  2nd dose of Spikevax (both homologous and heterologous schedules) is associated with 
pericarditis in the general population and in men 18-39 (6 and 17 excess cases 28d/100k for 
homologous and heterologous schedules in men 18-39 years, respectively). 
-  SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with myocarditis, more strongly in those 40 years and older 
(3 excess cases 28d/100k for 18 to 39 and 8 excess cases 28d/100k for 40+) 
- 
Further evaluation of biases are ongoing, and sensitivity analyses of primary outcomes are 
planned.  
Heterologous vaccination (BNT 1st+MOD 2nd) is associated with the highest IRR/er28d100k. It is 
noted that all data regarding heterologous vaccination originate from one country (NO), and only 
includes the combination BNT 1st+MOD 2nd. 
In the preliminary results, it is noted that among the homologous scheduled vaccines, Moderna has the 
highest IRR, compared to the other vaccines in the study. 
The preliminary results confirm the known risk of an association of Spikevax and development of 
myocarditis and pericarditis, with an increased risk found after the 2nd vaccination and primarily in 
younger men.  
At present, it has not been able to estimate a frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis following 
vaccination, and the frequency is “not known” in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The new data presented 
provide new information on the magnitude of the risk, and on the risk estimation in different age 
groups and gender. 
Further assessment of the risk, including risk characterisation and frequency estimates of myocarditis 
and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax is considered warranted. The signal is confirmed. 
2.3.  Proposed recommendation 
The MAH is requested to discuss these new findings, dated 5th October 2021, including the need to 
amend the current labelling.  
The MAH should discuss possible explanations for the disproportionate incidence rates of myocarditis 
and pericarditis for Moderna compared to the other vaccines in the study.  
In addition, the MAH is requested to present any support for estimation of frequency of myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis from clinical trial data or post-authorization data, preferably stratified by age and 
sex, if possible.

Also, the MAH is requested to present any new information from all available sources, including MAH 
safety database and literature, related to the risk characterization of myocarditis/pericarditis, including 
severity of the events and long term outcome.  
The  PRAC  Rapporteur  will  perform  a  separate  evaluation  of  the  preliminary  report  which  describes  a 
meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
2.4.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having  considered  that  new  data  on  the  known  risk  of  myocarditis,  pericarditis  has  become  available 
from a preliminary report which describes a meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden, the PRAC has recommended the following: 
1.  The  PRAC  Rapporteur  for  the  COVID-19  mRNA  Vaccine  Spikevax  should  perform  an  in-
depth evaluation of the preliminary report and compile a List of Questions for the researchers and the 
MAH  for  the  COVID-19  mRNA  Vaccine  Spikevax  (Moderna  Biotech  Spain,  S.L.),  as  appropriate. 
Considering that the results of the study are expected to become available starting 25 October 2021 at 
the earliest, these Lists of Questions will be further discussed in the PRAC plenary 25-28 October. 
2. The MAH for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) should continuously 
monitor  the  emerging  evidence  on  the  association  between  COVID-19  mRNA  vaccine  Spikevax  and 
myocarditis  and  pericarditis  arising  from  all  available  of  sources  (e.g.  clinical  studies,  observational 
studies considering in various jurisdictions, company data bases). 
3. The  Agency  will  provide  an  updated  observed  to  expected  analysis  considering  the  most  recent 
EudraVigilance data and the EEA exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines including the in under 18 years 
old. 
2.5. Adopted (second) PRAC recommendation  
Considering the current EU product labelling for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the new data on the risk 
of myocarditis and pericarditis that have become available after the PRAC recommendation in July 2021, 
the PRAC has agreed that the MAH of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) 
should  provide  by  15  November  2021  a  review  of  the  respective  data  from  clinical  studies,  from  the 
scientific literature and other data available in public domain (e.g. published data from Canada, Israel, 
US  and  other  jurisdictions).  The  MAH  should  respond  to  the  below  List  of  Questions  separately  for 
myocarditis and pericarditis.  
List of Questions: 
1. The MAH should provide a risk estimation of myocarditis and pericarditis overall and per age groups 
(e.g.  5-11,  12-15,  16-17,  18-24,  25-29,  30-39,  40+  also  depending  on  age groups  used  in  studies), 
gender, vaccine dose(s) (i.e. first, second or booster).  
2. The MAH  should perform further characterisation of myocarditis and pericarditis, with focus on the 
following:

• 
Provide an estimation of the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis, with the view to 
better characterize the current ‘unknown’ frequency in the product labelling. 
• 
Discuss  any  plausible  pathophysiological  mechanism(s)  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis 
observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax.  
• 
Data  on  the  characteristics,  severity,  duration  and  outcome  of  myocarditis  and 
pericarditis after vaccination with Covid-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax. 
3. Considering that the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis are outcomes of interest in the two ongoing 
PASSs in the EU/EEA (IT, ES, NL, UK, NO, DK) and in the US, the MAH should investigate if the planned 
analyses, including O/E and SCCS/SCRI, of myocarditis/pericarditis could be expedited and indicate when 
these can be submitted. In adolescents, narrow age strata should be applied, as feasible (currently EU 
PASS only). 
3.  Additional evidence  
The MAH have submitted a response to the LoQ as requested by PRAC and evaluated the data from the 
Nordic Cohort study and the French case-control study.  
3.1.  Assessment of additional data  
3.1.1.  ITEM 1- Risk estimation 
The MAH should provide a risk estimation of myocarditis and pericarditis overall and per age 
groups (e.g. 5-11, 16-17, 18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40+ also depending on age groups used in 
studies), gender, vaccine dose(s) (i.e. first, second or booster). 
Sponsor Response 
Multiple studies have recently estimated the risk of myocarditis following receipt of mRNA vaccines 
targeting SARS CoV-2. Both literature and surveillance sources consistently describe an increase in the 
incidence of myocarditis, predominantly within the days following receipt of a second dose of vaccine, 
that appears largely isolated to younger men (from 12 years to <30 years of age). Some variation has 
been observed in the magnitude of the association, which may be partially attributable to factors such 
as random variation (given the very low incidence of the outcomes) and differential ascertainment 
(based upon differences in data sources, search strategies, and stimulated reporting given increased 
awareness and monitoring following identification of the risk and appropriate public health measures to 
ensure appropriate treatment of potential cases). 
Moderna US PASS (mRNA-1273-P903) 
In the third interim report of the US PASS study (31 October 2021), a retrospective observational 
cohort study used secondary, de-identified individual-level medical and pharmacy claims data provided 
by HealthVerityTM to assess risk of AESI including myocarditis and pericarditis. This data source 
includes more than 140 million patients insured under commercial, Medicare or Medicaid plans, and/or 
served by providers participating in several large US medical and pharmacy insurance claims 
submission systems. 
Myocarditis was observed in 2,186 patients in a historical comparison cohort (IR 9.98 cases per 
100,000 person-years 95% CI 9.47 – 10.30) and in 253 patients following vaccination (IR 9.94 cases 
per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 8.72 – 11.17), producing a non-significant incidence rate ratio of

that was effectively null 1.01 (95% CI 0.88 – 1.14). An increased risk was observed in young men, 
where the incidence following vaccination was 34.71 cases per 100,000 personyears (IRR 3.30, 95% 
CI 2.29 – 4.65). Although there were small numerical increases in men ages 30-39 and young women, 
these estimates are based on small numbers and lack precision. Observed vs expected analyses 
considering a 7-day risk window following vaccination produced findings with similar interpretation with 
an increase was observed in all individuals 18 to 29 years of age, where 9 events were observed and 2 
expected (O/E ratio 4.93, 95% CI 2.25 – 9.36). A smaller, numerical increase for men ages 18 to 29 
was also observed for pericarditis. This outcome was observed in 5,418 patients in the historical cohort 
(IR 24.51, cases per 100,000 person-years 95% CI 23.86-25.16) and in 533 patients following 
vaccination (age and sex standardized IR 20.95 cases per 100,000 person-years, 95% CI 19.17 – 
22.73), producing an incidence rate ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 – 0.93). In young males, 32 cases after 
vaccination produced an IR of 30.85 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 20.16 – 41.54), corresponding 
to an IRR of 1.41 (95% CI 0.97 – 1.99). Overall observed to expected analyses and most age and sex 
specific analyses did not show an increase for the 7-day risk window, however an increase was 
observed in the 18 to 29-year age group (4 cases expected, 14 observed, OE ratio 3.31, 95% CI 1.81 
– 5.56). This was again driven by young males, where 2 cases were expected and 10 observed (OE 
ratio 4.19, 95% CI 2.01 – 7.71). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Additional details on study design 
In the US PASS study, myo- and pericarditis are included in the list of AESI. The study operates in a 
stepwise design: (1) estimation of IRR, (2) observed-expected (O/E) analysis and (3) self-controlled 
risk interval (SCRI) analysis. As stated by the MAH, IRR and O/E analyses of myo- and pericarditis 
were included in the third interim report.  
The IRR estimation is based on comparison of the vaccinated with a historical control cohort prior to 
the COVID-19 pandemic (01 Dec 2018-30 Nov 2019). A comparison with an “active” COVID cohort 
(01 Dec 2019 – 10 Dec 2020) is planned but not part of the interim analysis.  
Persons with myocarditis/pericarditis prior to follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Exposure 
was defined as vaccination with at least one dose of Spikevax.    
Myocarditis 
Myocarditis was observed in 2,186 patients in the historical cohort (IR 9.98, cases per 100,000 
person-years 95% CI 9.47 – 10.30) and in 253 patients following vaccination (IR 9.94 cases per 
100,000 person-years, 95% CI 8.72 – 11.17). The IRR of myocarditis for the general adult 
population was 1.01 (95% CI 0.88 – 1.14). However, for males 18-29 years the IR was significantly 
increased compared to historical IR: IRR 3.3 (95% CI 2.29 – 4.65). This was based on an IR of 
34.71/ 100,000 person-years. Of note, these were crude estimates and adjustment for age and sex 
did increase the IRR for male adults (all ages) from 1.12 (crude) to 1.41 (adjusted). For females 18-
29 years, there was only a slight numerical increase (IRR 1.57, 95% CI 0.8-2.85). 
O/E analyses were performed considering a 7-day risk window following vaccination. For males 18-
29 years, 8 observed events versus 1 expected (based on the IR in the background population 
standardized to the vaccinated population) produced an O/E ratio of 6.97 (95% CI 3.01 - 13.74). No 
significantly increased O/E was observed for any other age group in males or any age group in 
females.  
Pericarditis

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)  
EMA/PRAC/759618/2021  
Page 8/9 
 
 
 
Regarding pericarditis, in males 18-29 years, the IRR was 1.41 (95% CI 0.97 - 1.99). In this group, 
10 events were observed versus 2 expected leading to an O/E of 4.19 (95% CI 2.01 – 7.71). No 
significant increase was observed in females in any age group. 
Moderna Global Safety Database (Data Through 31 October 2021) 
As recently described in the 10th Monthly Summary Safety Report, myocarditis (with or without 
pericarditis) was reported in 1,807 cases cumulatively (reporting rate 9.89 per 100,000 personyears) 
and in 353 cases during this review period (reporting rate 14.47 per 100,000 personyears). 
Considering the rate of myocarditis occurrence as a proportion of vaccine recipients rather than as a 
function of estimated person-years, the cumulative reported cases corresponds to an overall reporting 
rate of 1.02 cases of myocarditis per 100,000 vaccine recipients. Data from the US military suggest an 
expected incidence of 2.12 cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients (Gubernot 2021). Compared to this 
background rate an increase in the reporting rate is apparent for males ages 18-24 years, with a 
reporting rate of 7.79 cases per 100,000 person-years (O/E rate ratio 3.68, 95% CI 3.09 – 4.38). 
Sensitivity analyses assuming that the reported cases correspond to 50% or 25% of total exposed 
cases suggest that the increased risk could plausibly extend to men under 50 years of age and 
potentially include young women.

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)  
EMA/PRAC/759618/2021  
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
 
The reporting rate was comparable to population-based estimates from the US not limited to the 
armed forces (Kang 2021: 10 per 100,000 person-years, 1,807 cases expected, rate ratio 0.99, 95% 
CI 0.93 – 1.06) when considering a 21-day risk window following vaccination. It should be noted that 
background estimates of the incidence of myocarditis vary widely, with some sources citing a range of 
1-10 cases per 100,000 person-years (Gubernot 2021) and others citing a range of 10-20 per 100,000 
person-years (Kang 2021). A recent publication from the OHDSI project saw higher estimates, noting 
that algorithms used have not yet been validated (e.g., Li 2021: average incidence of 29.79 per 
100,000 person-years with an estimate of 37 cases per 100,000 person-years in young males (Li 
2021)).

Further stratification suggests that the rate is higher after the second dose, however not all reports 
could be classified by dose based on limitations of spontaneous adverse event reporting (e.g., missing 
data). Considering cases with known onset and dose number that occur within the 7 days following 
vaccination, the same pattern of increased reporting in younger men is present. The MAH has not been 
able to conduct a similar age stratified analysis for myocarditis following a booster dose – due current 
product distribution. No similar increase has yet been observed following a third dose, however, use of 
third doses had been more common in older and immunocompromised individuals as of the end of the 
relevant data availability period (Table 2). 
Comparison to data from ACCESS sites shows a similar pattern, with the magnitude of the increase in 
young men variable based on the participating data center and year for which the estimate was 
produced. ACCESS rates span a broad range, and not all settings included within the project provide 
suitable reference rates. For example, conditions captured primarily in hospital settings will be poorly 
identified in general practice databases and vice versa. Further, differences in underlying disease 
incidence may be present comparing different countries, and studies drawn from smaller populations 
may be poorly precise for stratified analysis of rare outcomes. For these reasons as well as the 
observation that the majority of doses administered to data have occurred in the US, we consider the 
US estimates a preferable comparator group. Sensitivity analyses were, however, performed within 
ACCESS settings likely to capture both inpatient and outpatient care. The cumulative reporting rate 
(9.09 per 100,000 person-years) was between ACCESS estimates from Spain (FISABIO 2019, 3.36 per 
100,000 person-years, 614 expected, rate ratio 2.94, 95% CI 2.69 – 3.23) and the Netherlands 
(PHARMO 2019: 23.68 per 100,000 person-years, rate ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.40 – 0.44). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The MAH performed an O/E analysis and calculated reporting rates of myocarditis within 7 days of 
vaccination stratified by dose, age and gender. The risk of myocarditis has previously been 
considered causally related to the Spikevax mRNA vaccine. The current SmPC states that 
myocarditis occurs more often in men and after the 2nd dose.  
The O/E analysis shows that for both genders, 18 – 24 yo have an imbalance in observed / expected 
with a rate ratio of 2.49 (2.16, 2.87); however these data are mainly driven by males where the RR 
in the same age group is higher 3.68 (3.09,4.38). The RR for males is also higher than 1 in the age 
group 25 – 39 (1.32 (1.16,1.5)). No imbalance of O/E is observed for females in the same age 
groups.

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)  
EMA/PRAC/759618/2021  
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
When considering the sensitivity analysis, there have been observed more cases of myocarditis than 
expected in 18 – 39 yo when assuming 50% of all cases were reported, and up to 49 yo when 
assuming 25 % of all cases were reported for both genders. Again, this is mainly driven by males. 
For females the only increase is observed in 18-24 yo when assuming 50% of all cases were 
reported, and 18 – 39 when assuming 25 % of all cases were reported. 
In conclusion, the O/E analysis confirms what is already known and stated in the SmPC regarding 
the risk of myocarditis. The reporting rate of myocarditis pr. 100.000 doses show the same 
tendency. 
Since the last evaluation of myocarditis, Spikevax has been approved for use in children 12 – 17 yo. 
Exposure in this group is still limited and Moderna reports an exposure of 5.312.891 vaccine 
recipients < 18 yo and is almost equally distributed between males and females. O/E is still below 1, 
however taking the sensitivity analysis into consideration the RR exceeds 1 significantly and more 
specifically for males. The rates in the age group <18 should be interpreted with caution, as the 
exposure estimation is imprecise. Only 3 cases have been observed in females while 48 cases have 
been observed in males <18yo. The reporting rate remains low and is highest for males. 
Observed vs Expected, Pericarditis 
Pericarditis (with or without myocarditis) was reported in 974 cases cumulatively (reporting rate 5.33 
per 100,000 person-years) and in 172 cases during this reporting period (reporting rate 7.05 per 
100,000 person-years). Pericarditis without myocarditis was reported in 823 cases cumulatively 
(reporting rate 4.51 per 100,000 person-years) and in 147 cases during this reporting period 
(reporting rate 6.03 per 100,000 person-years). 
The cumulative rate for pericarditis was below the US-based incidence estimates, including an estimate 
of 5.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years has been identified in data from the Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (1,041 cases expected, rate ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 – 1.02) and an estimate of 7.4 
cases per 100,000 that has been observed in US armed service members deployed in the Middle East 
(1,352 cases expected, rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 – 0.78). 
Considering European background estimates, the cumulative reporting rate (5.33 per 100,000 person-
years) was above published estimates from Finland (Kyto 2014: 3.30 per 100,000 personyears, 603 
cases expected, rate ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.46 – 1.79) and below estimates from Italy (27.70 per 
100,000 person-years, 5,059 cases expected, rate ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.18 – 0.21). Findings were 
similar when considering pericarditis without myocarditis reported within the case and consistent with 
the last monthly report. 
Stratification of observed to expected analyses based on data from the US Nationwide Inpatient 
sample suggest an increased reporting rate for pericarditis in those ages 18-50 years of age, with 
larger increases occurring in men ages 18-24. Interpretation is similar in sensitivity analyses where it 
is assumed that 50% or 25% of cases are captured with no false positive errors, noting that risk 
becomes larger, and potential increases in young women more plausible (Table 3).

It should be noted that these analyses are performed based on all reported cases without adjudication 
and may include both confirmed and not confirmed myocarditis cases as well as miss other cases that 
could had not being reported to the MAH. Given the high level of international attention that 
myocarditis has received, and regulatory actions taken to enhance awareness of this important 
identified risk, we expect that sensitivity is likely high, but the challenge with specificity remains. 
In summary, observed vs. expected analyses show an increase in the reporting rate of myocarditis 
(with or without pericarditis) and pericarditis that is strongest for young men within a few days after 
the second dose. Although there is a possibility that the risk extends to young women, similar 
increases are not observed in older vaccine recipients. This is consistent with observations from the 
literature and observed vs. expected analyses performed in recent monthly reports.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The MAH performed an O/E analysis of pericarditis (without myocarditis) stratified by age and 
gender. The risk of pericarditis has previously been considered causally related to the Spikevax 
mRNA vaccine. Current SmPC states that myocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men and 
after the 2nd dose.  
The O/E analysis shows that the RR exceeds 1 in the age groups 18-24, 25-39 and 40 – 49. This is 
seen for all, males and females. The highest RR is seen for males 18 – 24 yo (4.3 (2.99, 6.18)). In 
the pediatric population (<18yo) there is not observed any significantly increased RR. However, as 
mentioned previously the exposure estimation in this population is imprecise. 
In conclusion, the O/E analysis confirms what is already known and stated in the SmPC regarding 
the risk of pericarditis. 
Other Sources of Surveillance Data 
Surveillance data from the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany suggested qualitatively similar but 
somewhat higher reporting rates for myocarditis, especially for men 18 – 29 years of age (11.71 cases 
per 100,000 vaccine recipients in German data, 7.79 in the Moderna Global Safety Database). 
Observed vs. expected analyses were similar, however, with German data showing an SMR of 4.44 
(95% CI 3.57 – 5.46) for this group. In Canada, published surveillance data from Ontario have 
followed the same demographic trend, with clustering of cases in young men after the second dose of 
vaccine. Observed reporting rates in the province were higher at 17.1 doses per 100,000 vaccine 
recipients among men ages 18-24 overall and 28.3 per 100,000 vaccine recipients following dose 2. 
Literature Assessing the Risk of Myocarditis and Pericarditis  
SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Myocarditis in a Nordic Cohort Study of 23 Million Residents1 
In a Nordic cohort study including a meta-analysis of the 23 million residents of Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden made available to the MAH prior to publication (Karlstad, 2021), during the 28-
day risk-periods following vaccination and during unvaccinated periods experienced by the study 
participants (6.7 million person-years in total), they observed 1092 incident myocarditis cases and 
1154 incident pericarditis cases. Incidence rates of myocarditis during unvaccinated time was 9.7 per 
100,000 person-years for men, and 4.2 for women. Among 16- to 24-year-old, incidence rates were 
18.7 for men and 4.4 for women. Incidence rates of pericarditis increased with increasing age. During 
the 28-day risk period, they observed 106 and 123 myocarditis cases following first- and second-dose 
vaccinations with BNT162b2, respectively, and 15 and 67 following mRNA-1273, respectively. 
The results of the study showed: 
•  Adjusted RRs comparing the 28-day risk periods following first- and second-dose vaccinations 
to unvaccinated periods were 1.2 (95%CI, 0.7 to 1.9) and 7.2 (95%CI, 5.3 to 9.8)  
• 
In males, following the first and second dose, adjusted RRs were 1.5 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.5) and 
9.1 (95%CI, 6.9 to 12). 
• 
In males, 16-24 years of age, the adjusted RR was 14.2 (95%CI, 8.4—23.8) for a second dose 
of mRNA-1273. For females, the comparative adjusted IRRs were lower 
•  Among all males, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods were 0.3 (95%CI, -0.1 to 0.8) and 5.4 (95%CI, 4.0 to 6.8) following first and second 
doses for mRNA-1273. The excess number of events for females were low.

•  Among males 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day 
risk periods following first and second doses were 1.7 (95%CI, -0.2 to 3.7) and 18.8 (95%CI, 
9.6 to 28.0) for mRNA-1273.The corresponding excess number of events for males 25 to 39 
years of age were somewhat lower. 
• 
In a mixed schedule (BNT162b2—mRNA-1273), close to 40 cases (34 males) occurred 
following the second dose. In males 16-24 years, 17 cases occurred, with an excess number of 
events of 26.5 (95%CI, 13.9 to 39.1). 
• 
IRRs of myocarditis or pericarditis combined in males 16–24 years were close to those of 
myocarditis. 
• 
In males 25–39 years the RRs were generally lower. In females 16–24 years the IRRs were 
similar to those of males of the same age, however, with wider confidence intervals. 
•  A 7-day risk period was also evaluated for the 228 myocarditis cases in the 28-day risk-window 
after a second dose of mRNA 
•  145 vaccination, events occurred within the first week, yielding higher IRRs. The 
excess events, per 100,000 vaccinated, during 7-day risk-window represented the 
majority of excess events during the 28-day risk-window. 
• 
In males 12–39 years, at least 75% of the cases were admitted to hospital within 10 
days of vaccination 
•  Comorbid conditions did not differ markedly between vaccinated and unvaccinated 
cases 
• 
Length of stay did not markedly differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases 
The authors concluded that the information collected in this study of 23.1 million individuals shows 
higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis within 28 days following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 
mRNA vaccines when compared to unvaccinated. These associations were strongest within the first 7 
days, were increased for all combinations of mRNA vaccines and were more pronounced after the 
second dose. A second dose of mRNA-1273, either after mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 as a first dose, had 
the highest risk. Young males aged 16-24 years had the highest increased risk. They also concluded 
that there was a higher risk after a second dose and a higher risk in young men, information that has 
already been documented and communicated to health care provided through appropriate risk 
communication measures.  
The authors also presented excess events within 28 days in young males of 5.7 per 100,000 after a 
second-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and 18.8 after a second-dose vaccination with mRNA- 1273 
which are higher than previously reported. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Additional details on study design 
The registry cohort study followed individuals from the start of the vaccination campaign in Nordic 
countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) until first outcome event, a positive SARS-CoV-2 
test, a third vaccination, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. All Nordic national registries allow 
analyses on the entire population and individual level through linkage to other registries such as 
health care utilization. In the main analysis, the IRRs and risk differences of myo- and pericarditis 
were estimated based on comparison of vaccinated with unvaccinated follow-up time (considering a 
28-day risk window following vaccination). The estimates were adjusted for sex, age, vaccine 
priority groups, comorbidities and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (before start of follow up, 27

December 2020; infection after this date was a censoring event). Country-specific estimates were 
pooled via meta-analysis, considering heterogeneity between the databases.  
Results 
As summarized by the MAH above. Additional results and important details:

The main estimates discussed here were based on 2,004,059 patients (male and female 
combined) who received two doses of Spikevax.  
The estimates were based on a risk period of 28 days following vaccination. In sensitivity 
analyses, a 7-day risk period was applied, which resulted in higher estimates. For males 16-
24 years the IRR after the second dose was 37.7 (95% CI 21.6 - 65.8).  
In males 12-15 years, the IRR of myocarditis following the second dose was very high 
(89.05). However, this was based on very few events and the precision was therefore very 
low.   
The risk estimates were generally higher (across all age groups) for Spikevax compared with 
Comirnaty. In males, 16-24 years of age, the adjusted RR was 5.4 (95%CI, 3.8 to 7.6) for a 
second dose of Comirnaty and 14.2 (95%CI, 8.4—23.8) for Spikevax. Among males 16–24 
years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk periods 
following the second dose was 5.7 (95%CI, 3.9 to 7.5) for Comirnaty 18.8 (95%CI, 9.6 to 
28.0) for Spikevax.  
•  Data on time to admission was included in supplementary analyses. The median time to 
admission was 5 days (p25% 3 days; p75% 7 days) in Denmark, 11 days in Finland (p25% 
4 days; p75% 15 days), 5 days in Norway (p25% 3 days; p75% 19 days) and 7 days in 
Sweden (p25% 3 days; p75% 18 days).    
•  Data on time to discharge and death after myocarditis was included in supplementary 
analyses. For male and females combined (all ages), 49.5% (95% CI 26.0 – 73.3) were 
discharged on day 4 or later following the second dose of Spikevax, while 53.7% (95% CI 
39.4 – 67.4) were discharged on day 4 or later in the unvaccinated. Following the second 
dose of Spikevax, 4.5% of patients died within 28 days (95% CI 0.0 – 13.2) versus 1.2% 
(95% CI 0.5 – 2.7) among unvaccinated.  
Strengths and limitations  
Inherent to the Nordic registries, this study captures the entire national population in the 4 countries 
with a total study population of over 23 million with a complete follow-up and independent 
ascertainment of vaccinations and diagnoses from nationwide registers to which reporting is 
mandatory. In the meta-analysis, the between-database heterogeneity was not statistically 
significant, despite some country-specific differences. Prior to follow-up myo- and pericarditis were 
exclusion criteria while individuals with COVID-19 during follow-up were censored. Likely 
confounders were appropriately adjusted for and the robustness of the results was assessed in 
sensitivity analyses (e.g. 7-day risk window, additional adjustment for calendar time).  
Myo- and pericarditis were defined as inpatient hospital admission with main or secondary discharge 
diagnosis. In the Danish registry, diagnostic codes have been shown to have an 85% positive 
predictive value in male patients below the age of 60 years7. Without access to data on clinical 
measures like troponin levels, diagnostic imaging results, or endomyocardial biopsy, it could not be 
assessed how many patients fulfill all criteria for a myocarditis diagnosis. However, median length-
of-stay was 4-5 days for both unvaccinated and vaccinated cases indicative of sufficient time for 
adequate diagnostic procedures. Assuming this source of misclassification would be non-differential,

this would bias risk estimates towards the null. However, the authors also highlight that 
aascertainment bias whereby increased focus on myocarditis as an adverse event after mRNA 
vaccination has resulted in more subclinical cases being diagnosed, cannot be ruled out. However, 
the authors highlight that this is unlikely to fully explain the differences between the two mRNA 
vaccines or between age groups. Considering such differential awareness between vaccines exists, 
this would bias the risk estimates away from the null.  
Time-dependent unmeasured confounding could have impacted the estimates, as the background 
incidence of myocarditis fluctuates with infectious-disease burden (higher during winter) and 
vaccines were utilized according to their availability (i.e. for younger age groups primarily during 
summer). Considering a skewed comparison of IRs based on the vaccinated primarily during 
summer with IRs from including the winter months, this would bias the estimates towards the null. 
However, adjustment for calendar time in sensitivity analysis did not change the results 
substantially.  
In a mass vaccination campaign, estimates based on a contemporary unvaccinated comparator 
group may be biased since unvaccinated persons are not likely to be representative of the 
appropriate background rates due to e.g. healthy vaccinee/ sick vaccinee effects. Considering a 
scenario in which the unvaccinated were sicker than the vaccinated and if these comorbidities were 
associated with the outcome, this would bias the estimates towards the null. However, comorbid 
conditions did not differ markedly between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Moreover, the 
authors highlight that potentially future sensitivity analysis (planned according to the preliminary 
report) may inform about the robustness of the estimates using the unvaccinated as a comparator, 
i.e. changing the comparator to the follow-up time day 29 or later following any vaccination. 
Association between COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines and the occurrence of myocarditis 
and pericarditis in people aged 12 to 50 in France - Study based on data from the National 
Health Data System (SNDS)2 
Similarly, a population-based case-control analysis using French national health data has shown a large 
increase in the odds of myocarditis within 7 days after vaccination, noting that confidence intervals 
were wide. The association with the risk of myocarditis appears particularly pronounced in young men 
under 30 years of age, particularly after the second dose of Moderna vaccine (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
79.8; 95% confidence interval [29.8-213.4]), leading to an excess of cases reaching 132 per million 
doses in this population. Although the occurrence of myocarditis is less frequent than in men, this risk 
is also increased in young women under 30 years old after the second dose (OR 40.6 [9.9-166.4] and 
37 cases in excess per million doses for Moderna). The risk of pericarditis also appears to be more 
marked after the Moderna vaccine in people under 30 years of age, in particular after second dose in 
men (OR 15.0 [3.3-68.4] and 18 excess cases per million doses) and after the first dose in women (OR 
27.9 [2.4-328, 0] and 6 excess cases per million doses). The conclusion of this study is that the 
number of cases attributable to vaccines appears to be infrequent in relation to the number of doses 
administered. 
This study also confirms the favorable clinical course of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following 
vaccination.

PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Additional details on study design 
This matched case-control study based on French national health data utilized all cases of 
hospitalization for myocarditis and pericarditis recorded between 15 May and 31 August 2021 
involving patients between the ages of 12 and 50. 
Each case was matched with 10 controls (randomly selected from among the whole population, not 
diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis during the study period) of the same age, gender and 
départment of residence. Additional adjustment considered history of myocarditis or pericarditis in 
the last 5 years, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the previous month, and the deprivation index. In 
sensitivity analyses, prior myocarditis/ pericarditis or prior SARS-CoV-2 are exclusion criteria. The 
relative risk was estimated using odds ratio of the association within the risk windows 1-7 days and 
8-21 days.  
Results 
As summarized by the MAH above. Additional results and important details:

• 
• 
• 
The risk was also increased in males 30-50 years with an OR of 18.0 (95% CI 8.0 – 40.6) 
and 26.5 excess cases per million doses.  
Estimates were similar upon exclusion of cases with prior myocarditis or pericarditis in 
sensitivity analysis 
Estimates were similar upon exclusion of cases with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the month 
preceding the index date in sensitivity analysis 
The risk estimates were generally higher (across all age groups) for Spikevax compared with 
Comirnaty. In males, 12-29 years, the adjusted OR was 10.9 (95% CI 7.6 – 15.8) for a 
second dose of Comirnaty and 79.8 (95% CI 29.8 – 213.4) for Spikevax. Among males 12-
29 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated was 2.67 (95% CI 2.55 – 
2.75) for Comirnaty and 13.16 (95% CI 12.99 – 13.33) for Spikevax.  
•  Among the exposed subjects, the median time to admission for myocarditis was 9.5 and 4 
days following the first and second dose of Spikevax, respectively. For pericarditis, the 
median time to admission was 9.5 and 10 days following the first and second dose, 
respectively. 
•  Data were presented for length of hospital stay for myocarditis (based on 919 cases) and 
pericarditis (based on 917 cases) following vaccination with any mRNA vaccine (no 
stratification) compared with the unexposed. For myocarditis, the median length of stay was 
4 days (IQR 2; 5) for unexposed, 4 days (IQR 2; 5) for vaccinated with onset of myocarditis 
within the risk window 0-7 days and 3 days (IQR 2; 5) for vaccinated with onset of 
myocarditis within the risk window 8-21 days. The time to discharge was longer than 5 days 
in 22.6% of patients amongst the unvaccinated, and 12.3% and 16.8% amongst the 
vaccinated 1-7 days and 8-21 days post-vaccination, respectively. Overall only 1 death was 
observed (among the unexposed). For pericarditis, length of stay was considerably shorter, 
but a similar pattern between vaccinated and unvaccinated was observed. 
Strengths and limitations 
During the study period 919 cases of hospitalization for myocarditis and 917 for pericarditis were 
identified. Given the low number of cases overall some estimates have low precision, and a narrower

stratification was likely not feasible. However, the link with the risk of myocarditis appears to be 
particularly strong among young men below the age of 30, which is in line with other studies. 
The definition of cases was solely based on diagnosis codes associated with hospital admissions. 
However, the incidence rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in France prior to the pandemic are 
consistent with those reported by other countries.  
Ascertainment bias whereby increased focus on myocarditis as an adverse event after mRNA 
vaccination has resulted in more subclinical cases being diagnosed, cannot be ruled out. Moreover, 
calendar time was not considered as a matching variable so that cases from the period of increased 
focus on myocarditis may be compared with controls prior to this period. However, it is unlikely that 
the differences between the two mRNAs and between age groups can be fully explained by such 
bias. Considering a scenario in which differential awareness between the vaccines exists, this would 
bias the risk estimates away from the null.  
Myocarditis Following COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine: A Case Series and Incidence Rate 
Determination 3 
A retrospective case-series was performed utilizing the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 Vaccine Registry. The 
authors measured the incidence rate ratio for myocarditis temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccination compared to myocarditis in a comparable population from 2016 through 2020. Clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of the affected patients was collected. A total of 21 individuals were 
identified, but ultimately 7 patients met the inclusion criteria for vaccineassociated myocarditis. An 
incidence rate ratio for myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was found to be increased 
for males at a rate ratio of 6.69 (95% CI 2.35 – 15.52) with poor precision for females (IRR 1.41, 95% 
CI 0.03 – 8.45). Limited sample size precluded stratified analyses (Perez 2021). 
In a US a population-based cohort study of approximately 2.4 million patients aged ≥18 years observed 
15 cases of confirmed myocarditis after any dose of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (2 cases after dose 1; 
13 cases after dose 2), for an incidence of 0.08 per 100,000 first doses and 0.58 per 100,000 second 
doses; acute myocarditis was described as a rare event. All reported occurred in younger males 
(median age, 25 years) who were hospitalized and had symptoms resolve with conservative 
management. The US FDA recently presented an assessment of myocarditis/pericarditis rates using the 
FDA Biologics and Effectiveness Safety (BEST) active surveillance system, which consists of 4 health 
claims data sources with a total 76.5–89.5 million annual enrollees. Within the first 7 days after 
administration of any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (eg, mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2), the incidence 
rate of myocarditis/pericarditis per 1 million person-days was generally low for all age groups; rates 
were highest for males aged 18–25 years after dose 2. At the October 21, 2021 CDC ACIP meeting, the 
COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group summarized the available data to date on 
myocarditis rates after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination from multiple worldwide safety monitoring 
systems, which indicated myocarditis was associated with both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 among 
adolescents and young adults, more frequently among males. The COVID-19 subcommitee of the WHO 
Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) also recently reviewed available evidence from 
multiple countries and noted that while some data suggest increased myocarditis incidence in young 
males after dose 2 of mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2, other data do not support this finding, and the 
overall risk is low. 
Several large US surveillance systems have shown comparable risk of myocarditis between mRNA-
1273 and BNT162b2 (eg, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS], FDA BEST System, and 
Department of Veterans Affairs active surveillance Rapid Cycle Analysis for COVID-19 vaccines). For 
example, the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force provided the reporting rate of myocarditis among

males aged 18–24 years after mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 as 3.68 and 3.85 per 100,000 second doses 
administered, respectively, based on data from the VAERS safety passive monitoring system. However, 
a recent analysis from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) estimated that there was an excess 9.7 
myocarditis/myopericarditis cases per million doses of mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 among 18–39-
year-olds (adjusted rate ratio [95% CI]: 2.28 [1.00–5.22]; 2-sided p-value: 0.049). Of note, the VSD 
analysis was based on small case numbers within 7 days after dose 2 (mRNA-1273: 14 cases [810,839 
total second doses]; BNT162b2: 12 cases [1,256,525 total second doses]). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Perez et al. performed a retrospective case-series using the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 vaccine registry 
and estimated the IRR for myocarditis temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared 
to myocarditis in a comparable population from 2016 through 2020. The estimated IRR is 4.18 
(1.63, 8.89) for any mRNA vaccine. For females the IRR was 1.41 (0.03, 8.45) and for males it was 
6.69 (2.35, 15.52). However, the IRR is based on few cases as only 7 cases of myocarditis after 
mRNA vaccination were included in the study. The authors mention a few limitations to the study 
including selection bias due to regional population demographics (Midwest states, US), potential bias 
for more severe cases due to the use of hospital codes which could lead to underestimation of the 
risk and that the cohort does not include adolescents <16 yo. In conclusion, the study confirms that 
males are at higher risk of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination, which the current PI already 
adequately describes. 
The MAH refers to an unidentified US population-based study of 2.4 million patients age 18 or older, 
that found an incidence of 0.08 per 100,000 first doses and 0.58 per 100,000 second doses of any 
mRNA vaccine. 
In addition, the MAH refers to incidence rates of myocarditis from the CDC and the WHO 
subcommittee GACVS which confirmed previous observations that the risk of myocarditis was higher 
in young men after the second dose. Furthermore, the GACVS noted that the risk of myocarditis in 
this age group seem to be higher for Spikevax compared to Comirnaty. An analysis from the Vaccine 
Safety Datalink (VSD) estimated an excess 9.7 myocarditis/myopericarditis cases per million doses 
of Spikevax versus Comirnaty among 18–39-year-olds.  
There were not presented any data from the CDC on the incidence rate of myocarditis in adolescents 
receiving Spikevax. 
Conclusion 
Considering evidence across these sources, it is suggested that the risk of myocarditis following 
SPIKEVAX is meaningfully increased, especially in younger men and after the second dose of vaccine. 
Although some estimates have limited precision given the low expected incidence of myocarditis. 
Associations with pericarditis have been comparatively attenuated, however the same pattern of an 
increased risk in younger men has been observed in several assessments. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Based on the evidence across different sources, the MAH concludes that the risk of myocarditis 
following Spikevax is meaningfully increased. This is acknowledged.

Vaccine Safety Datalink study 
In addition, the PRAC Rapporteur wants to highlight the interim analysis of the Vaccine Safety 
Datalink in the US (Klein et al, 2021)1. The MAH mentioned this study with regards to the further 
characterization of myocarditis (ITEM 2), but the data are considered relevant for the risk estimation 
as well. 
In this safety surveillance study, the incidence of serious outcomes (including myocarditis/ 
pericarditis) among vaccine recipients within the risk period (i.e. 1-21 days post-vaccination for 
myocarditis) were compared to those of concurrent comparators outside of the risk period (i.e. 22-
42 days post-vaccination for myocarditis).  
For 18-39-year-olds, considering a 0-7-day risk interval, the adjusted IRR after the second dose was 
“very high” (95% CI 11.70 - ∞). No definite estimate could be made here, since no event was 
observed in the comparison interval (versus 17 events in the risk interval). The excess number of 
events per 100,000 doses was 2.1. In the interim results available to the assessor, no stratification 
by gender was performed (except in the comparative analysis commented on further below).   
For Spikevax, no data on >18-year-olds are available (for data for Comirnaty see further below – 
Data on >18-year-olds).   
Klein et al also performed a comparative analysis between the two mRNA vaccines. For males 18-39 
years, the adjusted rate ratio (Spikevax rate versus Comirnaty rate) for myocarditis after the second 
dose in the 0-7-day risk window was 2.14 (95% CI 0.93 – 4.98), with 1.91 excess cases per 
100,000 doses.   
Summary and comparison of the major risk estimates from different sources  
The MAH commented on risk estimates from the following sources: the US PASS, the Moderna safety 
database O/E analysis, the Nordic cohort study (Karlstad et al, 2021), the French National Health 
Data System study and the Mayo Clinic case-series study (Perez et al, 2021).  
Across different populations and study designs, with different strengths and limitations, a robust 
increased risk for myocarditis following Spikevax has been observed in males <30 years.

The risk was estimated highest after the second dose for males 16-24 years with an IRR 
of 14.2 (95% CI 8.4 - 23.8). The excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 
28-day risk period was 18.8 (95% CI, 9.6 to 28.0).  
For males 25-39 years, the IRR was 13.53 (95% CI 8.85 – 20.68) and the excess number of

For females 30-50 years, the OR following the second dose was 18.7 (95% CI 4.7 – 
74.9) and the number of excess cases per 100,000 doses was 105. 
In summary, an increased risk of myo- and pericarditis following Spikevax was observed across 
different studies. It is important to highlight that these studies, based on large populations and 
different study designs with unique strengths and limitations, led to similar results: an increased risk 
particularly in males <30 years, which confirms the information already reflected in the SmPC While 
some variation in the magnitude of the association was observed, the association is also 
strengthened by the fact that 3 independent large studies (Vaccine Safety Datalink study, Nordic 
cohort study and French case-control study) observed higher estimates for Spikevax compared with 
Comirnaty.     
Data on <18-year-olds 
Very limited data on myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax are available for 
12-17-year-olds. In the Nordic cohort study, stratification for 12-15-year-olds was presented. For 
males in this age group, after the second dose of Spikevax, the IRR was 89.05 (95% CI 21.23-
373.49) with 36.51 (-4.81 – 77.82) excess cases per 100,000 doses. However, given the very low 
exposure (35,524 [males and females combined] in this age group received two doses) and the 
rarity of the events (<5 cases), the precision was very low. For females in this age group, no 
estimates were available, as there was no event in the unvaccinated to compare with. 
As no details were available regarding the proportion of <18-year-olds in the stratum 16-24 years, 
no definite conclusions can be drawn with regards to the risk estimation in <18-year-olds. This 
summer, the indication of Spikevax was extended to include the 12-17-year-olds. The exposure of 
Spikevax in 16-17-year-olds is still limited. It should be noted that for the other mRNA vaccine, the 
vaccine was indicated from 16 years and older from first authorization.     
The French case-control study did include persons vaccinated down to 12 years; however, data was 
too limited to allow for a detailed estimation in 12-17-year-olds at the time of data lock (August 31). 
As a result, stratification narrower than 12-29 years was not performed. 9.2% of all myocarditis and 
5.8% of all pericarditis cases were observed in 12-17-year-olds. Given the lack of comparative data 
in this age group, no definite conclusions can be drawn with regards to the risk estimation in <18-
year-olds at this point in time. 
3.1.2.  ITEM 2 - further characterization of myocarditis and pericarditis 
Sponsor Response 
•  Provide an estimation of the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis, with the view 
to better characterize the current ‘unknown’ frequency in the product labeling. 
Data on the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination from VAERS that were 
presented to the US ACIP in October 2021 (Su, 2021) appear consistent with other sources reporting 
rates including the MAH Global Safety Database. 
For men, incidence peaks in adolescents (noting that these data are available for Pfizer only in the 
United States), with the highest observed rate falling at 38.5 cases per 1,000,000 doses administered 
(Figure 1).

In women, a similar age distribution in the reporting rate is observed, however the overall magnitude 
is substantially lower. 
Based on the above-mentioned estimations from VAERS, myocarditis can then be considered a very 
rare event (Very rare (<1/10,000)) = ~ 0.385 cases per 10,000 in the subgroup at highest risk).

The MAH provided a frequency based on reporting rates provided by the CDC based on data from 
the VAERS database. Frequencies were based on the reporting rate for the subgroups at highest risk 
and were estimated to “very rare”.  
It should be noted that the estimated frequency from VAERS provided by the MAH is based only on 
US data. In the 10th MSSR, it was reported that 50 % of all administered doses were in the US and 
approximately 20 % of the doses were administered in the EEA. 60.6% of the cumulative cases 
originated from the US. Nevertheless, the VAERS reporting rates and estimated frequency match the 
observations from the MAHs safety database regarding myocarditis. Below are the reporting rates 
and estimated frequencies of myocarditis using the MAHs’ approach for the age group 18-24 yo from 
the MAHs Safety database:

In addition, the MAH provided a reporting rate from based on surveillance data from the Paul Ehrlich

1.17 cases/ 10.000(frequency estimation “rare”). For the same age group in the MAHs’ database 
7.79 cases per 100.000 doses were reported (~ 0.78 cases/ 10.000, frequency estimation “very 
rare”). 
Both the Nordic cohort study and the French case control study contribute with data about the risk 
of myocarditis from the EU. Below is an overview of excess cases reported from the epidemiological 
studies for myocarditis after 2 doses of Spikevax.

As previously noted by the MAH, the Nordic Cohort study and the French case-control study show a 
more frequent occurrence of myocarditis for young males expressed as excess cases per 100.000 or 
1.000.000 doses respectively. If the no. of excess cases provided in the studies is used as a 
measure to estimate frequency, the frequency for males 16-24 from the Nordic study and males 12-
29 from the French study would be “Rare” and for the remaining stratified groups it would be “Very 
rare” (please see above table).

Considering risk of pericarditis, the Nordic study and the French case control study present an 
excess no. of cases of 7.04/ 100.000 doses and 17.8/ 1.000.000 doses, respectively, younger males 
at highest risk. The estimated frequency for myocarditis then will be “very rare”, and there is 
therefore not observed a difference in frequency category as observed for myocarditis. 
An alternative non-comparative approach to the estimation of frequency would have been to simply 
use IRs per doses whereas the Nordic study express IRs per 1000 PY (common approach in 
epidemiological studies). However, in the Nordic cohort study, the number of persons vaccinated in 
the various age strata was only presented for females and males combined, whereas the number of 
events was only presented stratified by age. As an example, approximately 200,000 16-24-year-olds 
(male and female) received 2 doses; 16 events occurred in males 16-24 years, 0 events in females 
16-24 years. Speculating that half of the 200,000 doses were received by males, this would amount 
to 1.6 cases per 10,000 doses (frequency “rare”) in males 16-24 years. However, the precise 
exposure in terms of doses is unknown and this is roughly in line with the frequency estimation 
based on the excess-cases approach described above. Estimating frequency from excess cases 
therefore seems to be the best approach considering the presented data. No exposure data were 
presented in the French case-control study.  
It should be noted, that estimating frequency from excess case from epidemiological studies or from 
spontaneous reporting poses some challenges. Among others the following limitations: First, 
spontaneous reporting is potentially underreported. One could argue that increased awareness of 
the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis as a part of national vaccination campaigns, have decreased 
the risk of underreporting. This is likely true; however, it does not eliminate the risk entirely and 
underreporting will still be present. Second, the possibility that not all cases are “true” cases, i.e. 
causally related to the vaccine. This is a limitation for both spontaneous reporting and the two 
epidemiological studies. However, the nature of the epidemiological studies with comparison to 
background rates of myocarditis/pericarditis or controls from the respective countries for estimation 
of risk does in some way correct for this. The no. of excess cases derived from the observed risk 
estimates in the studies should therefore be a measure of cases that is above background rates and 
would result from vaccination. Third, the epidemiological studies use hospital codes to retrieve data 
on myocarditis and pericarditis. The Nordic study has an inclusion criteria of at least 24 hours 
hospitalisation. Less severe cases of myocarditis or pericarditis not requiring hospitalisation for this 
long would therefore not be included. Furthermore, most of the mentioned biases in the two studies 
(as previously mentioned in this AR) would affect the estimated risks towards null. Hence, estimated 
risks in the Nordic and French studies are potentially not overestimated. 
Considering available data on a potential frequency, especially data from the EU, the frequencies of 
myocarditis and pericarditis would be estimated to be “very rare” overall and the frequency of 
myocarditis would be “rare” for younger males. 
•  Discuss any plausible pathophysiological mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis 
observed after COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax. 
Several hypotheses have been proposed in the literature to explain the pathophysiology of the 
mechanisms involved in the occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis observed after vaccination with 
any of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Some of those articles are included below, but still the 
mechanisms for development of myocarditis or pericarditis are not understood.

Literature Assessing the Pathophysiology Mechanisms  
Myocarditis With COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines. Bozkurt et al4 
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines contain nucleoside-modified mRNA, encoding the viral spike glycoprotein 
of SARS-CoV-2, but not live virus or DNA. They are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that act as 
delivery vehicles to transport mRNA into the cells and may include inactive ingredients such as buffer 
and salts. Once inside the host cells, the vaccine’s mRNA causes the cells to build the spike protein 
which then stimulates an adaptive immune response to identify and destroy a virus expressing spike 
protein. Vaccine-induced spike protein IgG antibodies prevent attachment of SARS-COV-2 to its host 
cell via spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and thereby neutralizes 
the virus. 
Selected RNA molecules can be immunogenic and stimulate the mammalian innate immune system, 
destroying the mRNA before it reaches target cells, preventing the spike protein and neutralizing 
antibody production. Nucleoside modifications of mRNA have been groundbreaking, shown to reduce 
innate immunogenicity, and result in less activation of cytokines, paving the path for mRNA vaccine 
development. 
Although nucleoside modifications of mRNA have been shown to reduce their innate immunogenicity, in 
certain individuals with genetic predisposition, the immune response to mRNA may not be turned down 
and may drive the activation of an aberrant innate and acquired immune response. The dendritic cells 
or Toll-like receptor expressing cells exposed to RNA may still have the capacity to express cytokines 
and activation markers in certain individuals, although this may be markedly less when exposed to 
mRNA with nucleoside modifications than when treated with unmodified RNA. The immune system may 
therefore detect the mRNA in the vaccine as an antigen, resulting in activation of proinflammatory 
cascades and immunologic pathways that may play a role in the development of myocarditis as part of 
a systemic reaction in certain individuals. 
Another important potential mechanism for myocarditis is molecular mimicry between the spike protein 
of SARS-CoV-2 and self-antigens. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins have been 
experimentally shown to cross-react with structurally similar human peptide protein sequences, 
including α-myosin. However, severe adverse events or autoimmune reactions have been very rare. 
Although COVID-19 vaccination does not appear to provoke de novo immune-mediated adverse 
events, it is possible that it may trigger preexisting dysregulated pathways in certain individuals with 
predisposition, resulting in a polyclonal B-cell expansion, immune complex formation, and 
inflammation. 
In-Depth Evaluation of a Case of Presumed Myocarditis After the Second Dose of COVID-19 
mRNA Vaccine. Muthukumar et al5 
To explore potential mechanisms of myocardial injury in temporal association with vaccination in the 
studied case, written informed consent was obtained for additional in-depth analysis of viral, cytokine, 
and autoimmune panels and subsequent research publication of the case. Samples from the patient of 
interest were compared with excess, remnant blood specimens that were available in the laboratory 
after routine clinical testing. Samples from the case of interest (CI) were collected on days 1 to 4 after 
symptom onset (CIS1–S4) and were compared with 4 groups: naive unvaccinated (NUV; n=8), 
unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=10), naive vaccinated (NV; n=10), and age-
matched controls receiving Moderna vaccine (NM, n=2). NV and NM groups were tested ≈?2 weeks 
after receiving their second vaccine dose. The studies were performed as part of a biorepository 
protocol approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Institutional Review Board, and waiver of

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)

Institutional Review Board consent was obtained to use the remnant blood specimens. Detailed 
methods are provided in the Methods in the Data Supplement. 
Results of Exploratory Studies 
Antibody response to viral antigens and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins serum 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies against 18 different viral antigens and SARS-CoV-2 serology testing 
were measured using a custom developed proteome array and US Food and Drug Administration–
approved standard assays, respectively, using the methods described in the Methods in the Data 
Supplement. These studies confirmed the absence of previous COVID-19 infection (negative reactivity 
for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG). As expected, a clear immune response to the vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 
spike as a component) was observed in the case of interest 5 and 6 days after the second dose of 
Moderna vaccine, which corresponds with the third and fourth day after symptom onset in the case of 
interest (CIS3 and CIS4). Comparison of the strength of vaccine-induced immune responses in the 
case of interest at the measured sampling period CIS2 and CIS4 with either NV or NM did not reveal 
abnormally elevated SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG or SARS-CoV-2 spike IgM levels. Low IgG serology 
reactivity was noted in the case patient samples (CIS1–S4) for the other viral antigens, including 
cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza A, and respiratory syncytial virus compared with 
vaccinated control samples. It is interesting that, although anti-spike antibody levels were higher than 
the manufacturerrecommended positive threshold, the SARS spike protein antibody levels were either 
lower or just comparable in the case compared with NV. This may be partly explained by a difference 
in the timing of blood sampling after immunization among the vaccinated controls (2 weeks) versus 
case patient for assessing antibody response. Concurrent clinical evaluation for known infectious 
causes of acute myocarditis, including multiple SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction 
tests and Food and Drug Administration–approved multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction 
panels and serologies, were all negative with 2 exceptions. An IgG antibody for Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae was positive but IgM antibody was negative, consistent with previous exposure and not 
acute infection. In addition, an IgG titer of 1:320 was reported for coxsackie B virus 4, but IgM 
antibody titers were negative. However, convalescent serum antibody testing 3 weeks later revealed a 
titer of 1:160, consistent with remote and not acute or recent infection. 
Genetic Testing 
Given that inherited cardiomyopathy may present clinically as myocarditis, a panel test for variants in 
121 genes potentially linked to cardiomyopathy was performed (Invitae, San Francisco, CA). No 
pathogenic variants and 1 intronic variant of unknown significance (heterozygous, ACTN2, 
c2367+5G>A) were identified, suggesting that the known gene variants are not the cause of 
myocarditis in the case patient. 
Screening of Cytokine Response 
Although the vaccine-induced immune response is chiefly linked to protective immunity, an 
exaggerated and unwarranted immune reaction could potentially heighten inflammation and augment 
the risk of immunopathology. The authors measured a panel of 48 cytokines and chemokines in the 
case patient using fluorescent bead-based Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel, per the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, CA). Cytokine levels in the case patient were NV or NM. This 
analysis revealed in the case patient elevated levels of 4 cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-16, and MIG), 
diminished levels of 1 cytokine LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), and 3 other cytokines (IL-10, MIF, and 
VEGF) with bidirectional pattern (increase or decrease) relative to the comparators, NM or NUV 
(Table 3). Although statistical inference is not possible because of the single case patient, and the 
clinical relevance of the magnitude of difference seen is not clear, some of the following changes are of 
potential interest. The level of IL-1ra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) in the first sample from the case

patient after symptom onset (CIS1; 1174 pg/mL) was comparable with levels in patients with active 
COVID-19 infection (unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19; 1183 pg/mL). Generation of 
IL-1ra could be a compensatory counterattacking mechanism to limit excessive inflammation. In 
support of this notion, it has been documented that treatment with IL-1ra rescues myocarditis-
associated endstage heart failure. Around the time of symptom onset, the case patient also displayed 
elevated levels of other cytokines, IL-5, IL-16, and MIG (CXCL9), which play inflammatory roles in 
either myocarditis or related cardiac complications in humans or in experimental animal models. In 
contrast, relative to NM or NUV, the first sample of the case patient (CIS1) showed a decrease in the 
levels of cytokine LIF, which provides cellular stability and ensures survival of cardiomyocytes during 
stress. The other 3 cytokines, VEGF, IL-10, and MIF did not reveal a unidirectional regulatory pattern 
with comparators (NM and NUV); however, each spiked above the NUV reference group and has been 
individually implicated in immune vasculitis. Additional clinical laboratory assessment of IL-1β, IL-2, 
and IL-6 cytokines revealed normal levels of these cytokines. 
Autoantibodies 
Immunizations with adverse effects typically induce disproportionate autoantibody generation. Thus, 
the authors investigated whether the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and the associated nonviral acute 
myocarditis seen in the patient of interest may be a consequence of an autoimmune response, using a 
proteome array printed with HuProtTM version 3.1 arrays (CDI Laboratories, Mayaguez, PR) comprised 
of ≈19,500 unique full-length human proteins. Analyses for potentially informative autoantibodies were 
clustered into 3 separate subpanels representing common, COVID-specific, and CIS-specific groups for 
both IgM and IgG classes of circulating autoantibodies. In the common subpanel, the case patient was 
characterized by higher levels of 2 IgM autoantibodies (CRK and UNC45B) and 6 IgG autoantibodies 
(IL-10, KCNK5, PARP1, VCL, AKAP5, and IFNγ) compared with the patient with active COVID-19 and 
NUV controls, suggesting potential specific associations with myocarditis. Autoantibodies against IL-10 
and IFNγ have been detected in patients with life-threatening COVID-19, and previous reports indicate 
a cardioprotective effect for these cytokines in humans and rodents.15–17 IgM autoantibodies against 
several common antigens, including TNNC1 (troponin C1) and IL-1RN, were elevated in both the case 
patient and the patient with COVID-19, which is expected given the presence of cardiac injury and 
inflammation present in both disease scenarios. 
In the CIS-specific cluster, the case patient (CIS) had a pronounced excess of 3 IgM (CCDC97, CDK6, 
and EPHX2) and 21 IgG (AK1, CIRBP, CKM, CTGF, CXCL16, DGKZ, DNAI1, DNAI2, GDI1, HIP1R, 
HSPA9, IFT122, JUNB, KIF6, PQBP1, SF3A2, SH3GL2, STAMBP, THBD, TSEN34, and XXYLT1) specific 
autoantibodies compared with NUV or unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Out of this 
list, CXCL16 protein has been shown to increase in acute versus chronic myocarditis and suggested to 
be a novel biomarker for inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Likewise, elevated levels of connective tissue 
growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) have been elevated in fibrotic and tissue injury in heart failure. In addition, 
CIRBP/CIRP (cold-inducible RNA binding protein), a known cardiac electrophysiological regulator, has 
been shown to govern ventricular and atrial repolarization on cellular stress. The absence of antibody 
levels exceeding the prespecified criteria that cross-react with cardiac myosin and first and second 
extracellular loops of the β-adrenergic receptor is notable given previous reports of these 
autoantibodies in viral myocarditis. Whether the specific autoantibodies identified in the case patient 
play a role in disease progression or resolution needs to be determined by assessing their dynamics 
over longer-term follow-up in studies with larger sample sizes. 
This exploratory autoantibody analysis encompasses changes in autoantibodies against both 
intracellular and extracellular proteins/targets. However, it should be noted that autoantibodies against 
extracellular proteins/targets are more plausibly linked to disease pathology, in part because of their 
easy accessibility for binding. Also, autoantibodies to extracellular proteins are frequently reported to 
Signal assessment report on myocarditis and pericarditis with Spikevax - COVID-19

mimic genetic diseases for the same target protein or pathway with corresponding gain or loss of 
function. When autoantibodies against intracellular proteins are linked to a pathogenesis, it is often 
indirect, because the clonal expansion and the related process of recognition of antigens through the 
B-cell receptor occur in extracellular space with the support of extracellular proteins. Nevertheless, the 
autoimmune reactivity seen in the patient with respect to these self-antigens need not necessarily be 
pathogenic and could also be a part of the normal healing process of the inflamed myocardium. 
According to the authors future studies that specifically characterize the function and origin of these 
autoantibodies will be essential to understand their potential role in vaccine-associated myocarditis. It 
is ideal for such future studies to include a baseline sample from the same patient and also age-, sex-, 
and vaccine type– matched controls. 
Immune Cell Subsets 
Last, the authors assessed alterations in immune cell subsets in the patient of interest by enumerating 
T, B, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and investigating immunophenotypic aberrancy. This was 
performed using Becton Dickinson’s Multitest 6-color lymphocyte subsetting reagent with Becton 
Dickinson Trucount and additional immunophenotyping (CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD11b, 
CD13, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD25, CD31, CD34, CD38, CD45, CD45RA, CD62L, CD64, 
CD123, CD127, CD197, HLA-DR, TCRαβ, TCRγδ) by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto. 
A naive vaccinated subject had a frequency of CD3negCD16posCD56pos NK cells within the normal 
reference range. In contrast, the case patient had a nearly 2-fold increase in the frequency of 
CD3negCD16posCD56pos NK cells from the upper limit of the reference interval. This may indicate 
activation of a distinct subset of NK cells (CD3negCD16posCD56pos) that have been documented to be 
the most abundant (10% peripheral blood lymphocytes) and efficient cytotoxic effectors that kill their 
target cells by secreting cytoplasmic proteins. Although the changes in the absolute NK cell number are 
intriguing at present, the surge may have either contributed to the pathology or the disease resolution 
process. Low absolute CD3negCD16posCD56pos NK cell counts have been shown to correlate with 
orbital myositis, and the levels of these cells normalized with improvement in the disease activity. In 
addition, the patient showed a marginal increase in percentage and absolute count of NK lymphocytes 
by about 17% relative to the NM sample. This finding of high NK cell fraction in the case patient with 
resolved myocarditis contrasts with the recent multicenter IPAC study (Investigation of Pregnancy-
Associated Cardiomyopathy), which showed reduced levels of NK cells in peripartum cardiomyopathy, 
which normalized over time postpartum. Although the significance of this finding in the current patient 
with nonviral myocarditis is unclear, NK cells are known to play a cardioprotective role in viral 
myocarditis and autoimmune myocarditis by limiting viral replication and through modulation and 
inhibition of cardiodestructive activity by eosinophils, respectively. No other disease-driving 
immunophenotypic aberrancies were noted in the patient.  
In conclusion the authors noted that although multiple cytokines and autoantibodies with plausible 
links to myocarditis or cardiac pathogenesis appeared to differ in the case patient compared with 
controls, a specific signature was not identified. There was an increase in numbers of a specific subset 
of NK cells and increased expression of several autoantibodies compared with controls. T helper 17 
cells–related IL-17–enriched immune signature has been implicated in the development of myocarditis 
and its associated transition of fibrosis to heart failure. It is interesting that such upregulation of IL-17 
levels was not observed in their patient. The lack of evidence for upregulation of this cytokine, 
combined with the increased NK cell numbers observed in the case patient, could suggest a distinct 
vaccine-associated immunophenotype with a high likelihood for rapid recovery. However, it is not clear 
whether the observed differences reflect a potential (causal) pathological immune response or rather 
appropriate healing responses to myocardial inflammation. These differences may also be chance 
findings, given the exploratory nature of our investigations and large numbers of tests performed in 
few patients.

Shedding the Light on Post-Vaccine Myocarditis and Pericarditis in COVID-19 and Non- 
COVID-19 Vaccine Recipients. Hajjo et al6 
In an effort to understand post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis side effects that have been linked 
to mRNA vaccines lately, according to a statement from the CDC, the authors applied an informatics 
workflow to mine the VAERS database for post-vaccine myocarditis, followed by a systems biology 
analysis that relied on mining specialized chemogenomics databases for genes, proteins and chemicals 
that are linked to myocarditis. There were three COVID-19 vaccines included in VAERS database (i.e., 
vaccines approved by the U.S. FDA) including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen. The different 
vaccine preparations enter dendritic cells (DCs) at site of injection or within lymph nodes, resulting in 
production of S protein. 
The authors results indicated that post-COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis adverse events 
were more prevalent in young males 18-29 years old. Their data also showed that the number of 
myocarditis and pericarditis adverse events was higher for Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine followed by 
Moderna’s and then Janssen’s. They also found evidence in the biomedical literature documenting 
cardiac side effects after receiving smallpox and anthrax vaccines. 
The author’s systems biology results highlighted central signaling roles for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha 
in both myocarditis and viral disease maps. Finally, combing the knowledge from searching both 
VAERS and MetaCoreTM enabled the exploration of age and sex differences of post-vaccine 
myocarditis. They suggest that they found evidence in the biomedical literature indicating gender and 
age differences in many immunological factors. The sex differences in the levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, increase at puberty and then wane later in life 
suggesting hormonal effects. This goes in concert with our findings about the prevalence of post-
vaccine myocarditis in the age group in adolescents and young adults. Furthermore, Aomatsu et al. 
reported on the gender differences in in TNF-alpha production in human neutrophils stimulated by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IFN-gamma plus LPS. It was suggested that the lower sensitivity of female 
neutrophils to LPS and IFN-gamma, was due to the anti-inflammatory effects of estradiol on vascular 
endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. However, for immune response factors the sex 
difference remains constant from birth to old age (for example higher numbers of CD4+ T cells and 
higher rations of CD4/CD8 T have been reported in females at all age groups). 
To fathom post-vaccine myocarditis, it is important to understand that post-vaccine side effects (e.g., 
injection site pain, fever, chills, swelling fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joints pain, and others) are 
caused by the secondary enhancement of the inflammatory response which often results from short-
term changes to innate cells such as macrophages through ‘trained immunity’, and/or from the 
activation of memory T cells and B cells generated from the initial injection. There is also evidence that 
systemic vaccine side effects can be augmented with the second vaccine doses due to an amplified 
release of type 1 interferon which plays a central role in amplifying T-cell memory and B-cell 
differentiation and survival. This implies that post-vaccine inflammation after receiving booster doses, 
can further promote the generation and perpetuation of long-term immunological memory.  
The authors mentioned that they found evidence that IFN-gamma is also key component of the host 
defense to viral infection that is also elicited in response to viral vaccines. MRNA and viral vector 
vaccines trigger spike protein synthesis inside human cells which can then be presented on cell 
surfaces to cytotoxic T cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) MHC class I and MHC class 
II molecules, leading to virus-specific recognition and killing of infected or vaccinated cells. Interferons 
alpha, beta and gamma are required to induce MHC class I expression, while MHC class II 
transactivator factor (CIITA) is the master regulator of MHC class II expression and it is efficiently 
induced by IFN-gamma. However, most cell types do not express basal CIITA, and its expression is 
induced by IFN-gamma. In myocarditis, T lymphocytes (T cells), have been reported to home the

myocardium and to acutely reduce left ventricular (LV) function and this has been associated with 
increased levels of circulating cytokines, such as TNF-α which led to the prioritization of 
proinflammatory cytokines as markers of myocarditis and heart failure. It is also known that antigen 
presentation by endothelial cells may initiate rapid and localized ‘memory’ immune responses in 
peripheral tissues. Antigens displayed on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the 
surface of endothelial cells can then be recognized by T-cell receptors on circulating effector memory T 
cells triggering both trans-endothelial migration and activation. 
Type I interferons are key drivers for the antiviral state in non-immune cells and they orchestrate 
antiviral immune responses through: (i) the inhibition of viral replication in infected cells during the 
innate stage of the immune response; (ii) the activation and enhancement of antigen presentation in 
the “early induced” immune response, and (iii) the generation of the adaptive immune response 
through direct and indirect actions on T and B cells that constitute the memory response. TH1 
response, which triggers IFN-gamma expression that in turn activates CTLs and NK cells. From a 
homeostatic point of view, prolonged effector function of these cells may lead to excessive cytotoxicity 
and other detrimental effects resulting in host tissue damage. Additional support for the identified role 
of IFN-gamma in myocarditis came from a recent Nature publication by Arunachalam et al. confirming 
that Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine induced a heightened innate immune response after secondary 
immunization relative to primary immunization implicating the overexpression of IFN-gamma in driving 
innate and antiviral responses after the booster. 
It should be noted that this study has a few limitations. First, while VAERS is a valuable source for 
monitoring vaccine adverse effects, reports from VAERS alone may not be conclusive to establish a 
causal relationship between an adverse event and a vaccine use. Due to the voluntary nature of VAERS 
reports, the information provided about an adverse effect can be imperfect, imprecise, coincidental, or 
unconfirmed, limiting the scientific use of such reports. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The MAH has presented literature where several potential pathophysiological mechanisms have been 
suggested.  
Bozkurt et al. proposes three potential mechanisms for mRNA vaccines to cause myocarditis or 
pericarditis.  
The first is that some individuals have a genetic predisposition that makes them react differently to 
mRNA component in the mRNA vaccine. Nucleoside modifications of mRNA have been shown to 
reduce their innate immunogenicity, in these individuals, the immune response to mRNA may not be 
turned down and may drive the activation of an aberrant innate and acquired immune response. The 
authors proposed that the immune system may detect the mRNA in the vaccine as an antigen, 
resulting in activation of proinflammatory cascades and immunologic pathways that may play a role 
in the development of myocarditis as part of a systemic reaction.  
The second possible mechanism for myocarditis is molecular mimicry of SARS-CoV-2 and self-
antigens (e.g. alpha myosin). 
The third hypothesis is that vaccination may trigger preexisting dysregulated pathways in 
predisposed individuals resulting in e.g. inflammation. 
Muthukumar et al. presents a case of a 52-year-old male, who develops myocarditis 3 days after his 
second dose of Spikevax. In addition, the authors perform a wide range of exploratory tests to 
explore potential mechanisms of myocardial injury in temporal association with vaccination. The 
Authors compare the patient with excess, remnant blood specimens that were available in the 
laboratory after routine clinical testing. The comparators include “naive unvaccinated” (n=8),

“unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19” (n=10), “naive vaccinated” (NV; n=10), and 
“age-matched controls receiving Moderna vaccine” (n=2). The exploratory tests included genetic 
testing, cytokine response, autoantibodies and immune cells subsets. No genetic predisposition of 
myocarditis was identified. Tests for cytokine response and autoantibodies showed a difference in 
multiple cytokines and autoantibodies with plausible links to myocarditis or cardiac pathogenesis 
compared to controls. The results of the test for immune cells subsets showed that 
CD3negCD16posCD56pos posed a 2-fold increase compared to a native vaccinated subject. The 
authors conclude that no specific signature was identified for the case of myocarditis post 
vaccination. It is also highlighted that the it is not clear whether the observed differences reflect a 
potential tendency of myocarditis after vaccination or could be a part of the normal healing process 
in response to myocardial inflammation. Although interesting, the study is based on a single case 
and a range of tests from the same person. The PRAC rapporteur agrees with the observation that, 
the observed differences may be chance findings. 
Hajjo et al. performed and study using an informatics approach to study post-vaccine adverse 
events on the systems biology level. They performed and analysis of VAERS using systems biology 
methods and used MetaCore to identify a potential pathway for post-vaccine induced myocarditis. 
The systems biology results suggested a central role of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) in the 
biological processes leading to cardiac adverse events. The authors found evidence that IFN-gamma 
is also key component of the host defense to viral infection that is also elicited in response to viral 
vaccines. 
In conclusion, the mechanism explaining how Spikevax causes myocarditis or pericarditis is still to 
be elucidated. However, several mechanisms have been suggested in the literature. 
•  Data on the characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of myocarditis and 
pericarditis after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Spikevax. 
Although most cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis have been described as mild and selflimiting, 
additional data are needed to characterize the natural history and long-term outcomes of these events. 
In a study by Klein et al (2021) using the VSD, 34 confirmed cases of myocarditis/pericarditis had 
elevated troponin levels, and many had electrocardiographic changes, cardiac MRI changes, or both. 
However, 2 individuals (6%) required intensive care unit care, and consistent with previously described 
cases, all patients survived to hospital discharge.  
In a hospital-based study describing 20 cases of myocarditis and 37 cases of pericarditis without 
myocarditis (Diaz 2021), all were discharged after a median of two days, and no readmission or death 
events occurred. For two patients who received a second vaccination after onset of myocarditis, 
symptoms did not worsen. 
In the most recent MSSR, cases of myocarditis and pericarditis continue to primarily occur in young 
adult males, between 18 to 29 years of age, shortly after the second dose of the vaccine and within 
the first 6 days after vaccination. Most events were considered mild to moderate in severity and were 
reported as either resolved or resolving.

individuals aged 12-39 years. 2 individuals (6%) required intensive care unit care, and all patients 
survived to hospital discharge. The MAH concludes that most events were considered mild to 
moderate in severity and were reported as either resolved or resolving. However, The PRAC 
rapporteur wants to highlight that serious cases are also reported. In the 10th MSSR a fatal case in a 
24-y/o male was reported:  
This case, is highlighted here: The case concerns a 24-year old male, with no reported medical 
history or concomitant medication, who developed acute myocarditis (biopsy confirmed) and were 
found dead 3 days after the 2nd vaccination. Acute myocarditis was considered cause of death, and 
although there is no information on concurrent medical comorbidities, a causal association with the 
vaccine cannot be excluded.  The case is Level 1 according to the Brighton and “confirmed” 
according to the CDC case definition, and causality assessed as WHO Possible by the MAH 
The MAH also references a hospital-based study in the US by Diaz et al (2021)3 investigating time to 
onset and time to discharge for myocarditis/ pericarditis following vaccination. Based on 20 cases of 
myocarditis (11 cases following Spikevax), the median time-to-onset was 3.5 days (IQR 3.0-10.9). 
The median time to discharge was 2 days (IQR 2-3). For pericarditis, the median time-to-onset was 
20 days (IQR 6.0 – 41.0) and the median time to discharge was 1 day (IQR 1-2). No deaths were 
reported for myocarditis and pericarditis.  
In addition, studies mentioned in ITEM 1 presented relevant comparative data to further 
characterize myocarditis following vaccination.   
In the Nordic cohort study, data on time to admission and time to discharge for myocarditis were 
included in supplementary analyses.  
The median time to admission following vaccine-associated myocarditis  was 5 days (p25% 3 days; 
p75% 7 days) in Denmark, 11 days in Finland (p25% 4 days; p75% 15 days), 5 days in Norway 
(p25% 3 days; p75% 19 days) and 7 days in Sweden (p25% 3 days; p75% 18 days).  
Data on time to discharge and death after myocarditis was included in supplementary analyses. For 
male and females combined (all ages), 49.5% (95% CI 26.0 – 73.3) were discharged on day 4 or 
later following the second dose of Spikevax, while 53.7% (95% CI 39.4 – 67.4) were discharged on 
day 4 or later in the unvaccinated. For Comirnaty, a similar pattern was observed. Following the 
second dose of Spikevax, 4.5% of patients died within 28 days (95% CI 0.0 – 13.2) versus 1.2% 
(95% CI 0.5 – 2.7) among unvaccinated.  
In the French case-control study, data on time to admission was presented. Among the exposed 
subjects, the median time to admission for myocarditis was 9.5 and 4 days following the first and 
second dose of Spikevax, respectively. For pericarditis, the median time to admission was 9.5 and 
10 days following the first and second dose, respectively. 
Moreover, data was presented for length of hospital stay for myocarditis (based on 919 cases) and 
pericarditis (based on 917 cases) following vaccination with any mRNA vaccine (no stratification) 
compared with the unexposed. For myocarditis, the median length of stay was 4 days (IQR 2; 5) for 
unexposed, 4 days (IQR 2; 5) for vaccinated with onset of myocarditis within the risk window 0-7 
days and 3 days (IQR 2; 5) for vaccinated with onset of myocarditis within the risk window 8-21 
days. The time to discharge was longer than 5 days in 22.6% of patients amongst the unvaccinated, 
and 12.3% and 16.8% amongst the vaccinated 1-7 days and 8-21 days post-vaccination, 
respectively. Overall only 1 death was observed (among the unexposed). For pericarditis, length of

stay was considerably shorter, but a similar pattern between vaccinated and unvaccinated was 
observed. 
Overall, considering time to discharge as a measure of severity, these data indicate that the clinical 
picture of myo- and pericarditis following vaccination is similar to that of these events in the 
unvaccinated. However, as pointed out by the MAH, although most cases of vaccine-associated 
myocarditis have been described as mild and self-limiting, additional data are needed to characterize 
the natural history and long-term outcomes of these events. Of note, in the ongoing procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028, the MAH proposes an additional PASS to address this specific issue. The 
proposed submission of the study protocol is 28 February 2022. Similarly, time to admission seem 
can be seen as a measure of time to onset, and confirms previous observations that cases primarily 
occur within 14 days following vaccination as stated in the SmPC of Spikevax 
In conclusion, the current PI wording regarding severity or characteristics of the events and time to 
onset of myocarditis or pericarditis seem to be consistent with observations made in the above 
mentioned epidemiological studies. 
3.1.3.  ITEM 3 - US PASS 
Considering that the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis are outcomes of interest in the two 
ongoing PASSs in the EU/EEA (IT, ES, NL, UK, NO, DK) and in the US, the MAH should 
investigate if the planned analyses, including O/E and SCCS/SCRI, of 
myocarditis/pericarditis could be expedited and indicate when these can be submitted. In 
adolescents, narrow age strata should be applied, as feasible (currently EU PASS only). 
Sponsor Response 
Preliminary analyses of myocarditis and pericarditis were included within the most recent interim 
report for the US PASS (mRNA-1273-P903) submitted on 31 October 2021. Additional descriptive 
analyses are ongoing and will be submitted along with SCRI analyses upon approval of the applicable 
protocol appendix by the US FDA (also submitted 31 October 2021) detailing the risk windows and 
additional considerations to be applied in execution. The MAH has asked that analyses of these 
outcomes are expedited for the European PASS (mRNA-1273-P904), and participating data partners 
from the VAC4EU network are working to confirm the feasibility of this request. At present, it is 
anticipated that the timeline for data extraction (31 December 2021) cannot be modified, however 
analyses for myocarditis and pericarditis will be prioritized as the first to be executed. Results will be 
shared upon their availability, and the study team will work to prepare these in advance of the next 
interim report (31 March 2022). 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The MAH’s effort to expedite the myocarditis/ pericarditis analyses in the ongoing PASSs (US and 
EU) are acknowledged. 
PRAC Rapporteurs overall assessment comment: 
Risk estimation 
An increased risk of myo- and pericarditis following Spikevax was observed across different studies. 
While other sources such as an O/E analysis from the company safety database confirm the 
association, the assessment focused particularly on the following large comparative studies: interim

report of the Moderna US PASS (2,438 myocarditis and 5951 pericarditis events), the Nordic cohort 
study (1092 myocarditis and 1154 pericarditis events) and the French National Health Data System 
study (919 myocarditis and 917 pericarditis events).  
It is important to highlight that these studies, based on large populations and different study designs 
with unique strengths and limitations, led to similar results: an increased risk of myocarditis 
particularly in men <30 years. For pericarditis, a similar pattern but a less strong association was 
observed. While some variation in the magnitude of the association was observed, the association is 
also strengthened by the fact that 3 independent large studies (Vaccine Safety Datalink study (Klein 
et al, 2021), Nordic cohort study and French case-control study) observed higher estimates for 
Spikevax compared with Comirnaty. Overall, the current PI wording of myocarditis and pericarditis is 
considered to sufficiently cover the observations made in the beforementioned studies. 
Very limited data on myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax are available for 
12-17-year-olds. In the Nordic cohort study, estimates for males 12-15 years were very imprecise 
and based on <5 cases. 35,524 (males and females combined) in this age group received two doses. 
For females in this age group, no estimates were available. As no details were available regarding 
the proportion of <18-year-olds in the stratum 16-24 years, no definite conclusions can be drawn 
with regards to the risk estimation in <18-year-olds. Based on the recent extension of indication of 
Spikevax to include the 12-17-year-olds approved late July 2021, exposure in 16-17-year-olds is 
still limited. In comparison Comirnaty has been approved in the 16-17 year old from first 
authorization. The French case-control study did include persons vaccinated down to 12 years; 
however, data was too limited to allow for a detailed estimation in 12-17-year-olds at the time of 
data lock (August 31). As a result, stratification narrower than 12-29 years was not performed. In 
conclusion, the data currently available for the paediatric population are too limited to provide a 
comprehensive estimation of the risk for myo- and pericarditis following vaccination with Spikevax.   
Further characterization 
The MAH provided an estimation of frequency based on reporting rates from VAERS and estimated 
the frequency to the category “Very rare”. Additional data from epidemiological studies was not 
taking into consideration by the MAH for the purpose of estimating frequency. Best estimates of 
frequency from the Nordic cohort study and French case-control study were provided by the PRAC 
rapporteur. Data from these studies on myocarditis suggest that the frequency for males 16-24 from 
the Nordic study and males 12-29 from the French study would fall into the frequency category 
“Rare” and for the remaining stratified groups it would be “Very rare”.  For pericarditis, the 
frequency would be “very rare” for all stratum. As mentioned above, information about the risk in 
the population < 18 is limited and as a consequence hereof, the PRAC rapporteurs considers the 
data too sparse to conclude on the risk in this population which includes a frequency estimation. In 
conclusion, data have been presented that can be used to estimate a frequency of myocarditis or 
pericarditis with Spikevax. Therefore, the PRAC rapporteur considers that the current frequency “not 
known” should be updated. 
The Nordic cohort study assessed time to admission for vaccine-associated myocarditis. The median 
time to admission was between 5 and 11 days in the different countries, which is in line with the 
information reflected in the current SmPC section 4.4. (“[…] primarily occurred within 14 days 
following vaccination […]”). A similar pattern was observed in the French case-control study. Among 
the exposed subjects, the median time to admission for myocarditis was 9.5 and 4 days following 
the first and second dose of Spikevax, respectively.       
Data on time to discharge and death from the Nordic cohort and the French case-control studies 
showed a similar picture for vaccine-associated myocarditis compared with myocarditis occurring in

the unvaccinated. These data confirmed what is reflected in the SmPC (“Available data suggest that 
the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or 
pericarditis in general”). However, as pointed out by the MAH, although most cases of vaccine-
associated myocarditis have been described as mild and self-limiting, additional data are needed to 
characterize the natural history and long-term outcomes of these events. Of note, in the ongoing 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028, the MAH proposes an additional PASS to address this specific 
issue. The proposed submission of the study protocol is 28 February 2022. 
In conclusion, the presented data confirms previous observations about the risk of myocarditis and 
pericarditis. The current SmPC wording is there for largely in line with the observed characteristic of 
the ADRs and only few updates is considered warranted. The PRAC rapporteur considers that the 
frequency should be updated to reflect the new information. 
3.2.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
Overall,  the  new  data  confirmed  previous  observations  of  an  increased  risk  of  myocarditis  following 
vaccination with Spikevax. The risk was generally higher after the second dose and particulary in younger 
males. The risk of pericarditis showed the same trends. However, the new data made an estimation of 
frequency feasible. 
Therefore the PRAC rapporteur proposes to update the product information of Spikevax regarding the 
risk of myocarditis and pericarditis with the following:  
Summary of product information: 
Section 4.4: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with 
Spikevax. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after 
the second vaccination, and more often in younger men (see section 4.8). Available data suggest 
that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or 
pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition.  
The risk of myocarditis after a third dose (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms) or booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 
micrograms) of Spikevax has not yet been characterised.  
Based on very limited data in the paediatric population, the risks of myocarditis and 
pericarditis have not yet been characterised.

* The frequency is estimated from a Nordic cohort study of 23.1 million individuals from DK, 
FI, NO and SE. After 2 doses Spikevax there were estimated 8.49 (95% CI 6.76 – 10.22) and 
2.13 (95% CI 1.23 – 3.04) excess cases of myocarditis per 100.000 vaccinated in 28 days in 
men and women over the age of 12, respectively. The increased risk of myocarditis and 
pericardits after vaccination with Spikvax is highest in younger men (see section 4.4). For 
Pericarditis there were estimated 7.04 (95% CI 1.39-12.7) excess cases per 100.000 
vaccinated in 28 days in younger males after 2 doses of Spikevax. For myocarditis, after 2 
doses of Spikevax there were estimated to 18.8 ( 95% CI 9.56 – 28.04) excess cases per 
100.000 vaccinated in 28 days. The frequency of myocarditis in younger men is considered 
to be within the freqeuncy category “Rare”.

3.3.  Comments from other PRAC members and MAH(s)  
Comments were received from Member State (MS)1, MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5 and MS6. Full endorsement 
was received from MS7. 
3.3.1.  MS2 
We generally support the rapporteur’s assessment report. However, we have an additional comment 
regarding the harmonization of the data between Comirnaty and Spikevax, particularly on the 
denominator of the incidence which differs for the two vaccines. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The comment is highly appreciated. The PRAC rapporteur agrees that harmonization of the data 
between the two mRNA vaccines would be ideal. This would also enable to highlight the difference in 
the magnitude of the risk between Spikevax and Comirnaty. However, in the studies the proposed 
update for Comirnaty is based on, no data for Spikevax was available. In the updated 
recommendation, we propose to reflect the increased risk in younger men based on two large 
European studies (EPI-PHARE and Nordic cohort study), which include data for both Comirnaty and 
Spikevax. For younger men, considering the estimates of “excess number of cases per 100,000 
doses” from these studies, this would result in the frequency “Rare” for Spikevax and “Very Rare” 
for Comirnaty.  
3.3.2.  MS5 
The PRAC Rapporteur’s AR is generally endorsed. However, we have some additional comments.

−  With regards to the wording in 4.8: As multiple studies show an increased risk of 
myocarditis/pericarditis, the reference to the Nordic cohort study may be questioned, a more 
general reference could be considered.  
−  The information about risk should be uniformly presented in the product information for both mRNA 
vaccines for easy interpretation and risk comparison.  
−  The last sentence included in section 4.4 is in particular endorsed, and should also be included for 
Comirnaty:  
Based on very limited data in the paediatric population, the risks of myocarditis and 
pericarditis have not yet been characterised. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The comment is highly appreciated. The PRAC rapporteur agrees that a more general reference is 
favorable. We would like highlight that all the evidence was considered for the proposed 
recommendation. Across multiple sources, the frequency of myocarditis in the general population is 
very rare and a higher frequency is seen in younger men. In the updated recommendation we 
propose to contextualize the frequency “very rare” with data from two studies (EPI-PHARE and 
Nordic cohort study, without referencing these specifically) highlighting an increased risk particularly 
in younger men (frequency “Rare). The primary reasons for focusing on data from these studies are: 
1.  The estimates on number of excess cases in the vaccinated population is helpful from a 
public health perspective 
2.  Data are available for both Spikevax and Comirnaty, which would facilitate harmonization/ 
comparison between the two (as highlighted in MS5’s comment and MS2 further above) 
Regarding the last sentence in 4.4, the particular endorsement is appreciated. It should be 
emphasized that this is to highlight that for Spikevax there is currently not enough data available to 
inform about the risk. However, we do not agree with MS5 in that this should be included for 
Comirnaty, as there is considerably more evidence available in <18-year-olds. 
3.3.3.  MS6  
In large, we agree with the assessment by the PRAC rapporteur and the need to update the PI. 
However, we have some additional comments, including a proposal for a more detailed update of the 
PI, given that there currently is a substantially larger data set available than at the time of deciding 
the current wording (See below).  
CLINICAL SAFETY 
Evaluation of myocarditis and pericarditis cases:   
•  When presenting some of the data, and particularly in summaries, myocarditis and pericarditis 
are lumped together. This is unfortunate, as these are not the same diseases, and e.g. the 
clear sex difference in both natural and vaccine induced occurrence of myocarditis, is not at all 
obvious for pericarditis. Thus, we find it important to analyse these entities separately.   
•  We note that for myocarditis only BC level 1 cases are primarily reviewed. However, for future 
reviews, we find it important that also BC level 2 cases are closely considered in the analysis, 
as cases assessed as BC level 2 add valuable information regarding myocarditis risk after 
vaccination.

Page 39/40 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
It is agreed that myocarditis and pericarditis preferably should be analyzed separately. Regarding 
the comment on case definitions; since this signal assessment for Spikevax has focused on new 
data regarding the frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis, case reviews have not played a part 
in this signal assessment. It is however agreed that both cases of myocarditis with BC level 1 and 
2 provide valuable information, and should be considered in qualitative analyses. 
Regarding subsequent outcomes for those developing vaccine induced myocarditis 
/pericarditis:  
We acknowledge that there is a continued lack of knowledge regarding potential underlying 
mechanisms as well as of long-term outcomes of both vaccine induced diseases. Continued work is 
important.  
We note in the conclusion from e.g. the French study, stating: the study confirms the positive clinical 
prognosis for cases of myocarditis and pericarditis arising after vaccination.  
We find it too early to draw such conclusions, particularly considering the so far short follow up time 
analysed. The sentence in the current SmPC : ‘Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis 
and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. is not 
optimal, given the substantial uncertainties regarding long-term consequences, as well as the fact that 
there are some serious cases also observed in the short term. This is a very important issue for further 
follow up. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
It is agreed that there are still uncertainties regarding the long-term consequences of vaccine induced 
myocarditis, and this is a topic with a continuous focus of attention in the post marketing surveillance. 
In particular, in the ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028, a category 3 PASS is proposed as 
an additional pharmacovigilance activity to further characterize vaccine-associated 
myocarditis.Considering the time-to-discharge as an indicator of severity, based on the data from the 
Nordic cohort study and the EPI-PHARE study, there does not seem to be a difference in severity 
between vaccine-induced and naturally occurring myocarditis. Therefore, at present, and to our 
knowledge, there are no data indicating that the course of myocarditis/pericarditis following 
vaccination should be more detrimental/ have worse long-term outcome than e.g. viral induced 
myocarditis/pericarditis. However, if new information arises, this section in 4.4 should be updated 
accordingly. 
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS, PACKAGE LEAFLET AND LABELLING 
Section 4.4:  
We note that only minor changes are proposed for the current wording, which is based on the review 
of a limited number of spontaneously reported cases, which were available by the end of June 2021. 
However, at present, the available data have increased substantially since then. For instance, it can 
clearly be concluded that there is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. The present text is very vague by stating ‘cases have been observed’, which we do not 
find adequate anymore. A revision should be made (see below).

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)  
EMA/PRAC/759618/2021  
Page 40/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, we suggest revising the wording related to time to onset with some more detail. The reason is 
that, although the current wording ‘within 14 days’ is not incorrect, there is a notable number of cases 
(both among the spontaneously reported, as well as in e.g. the Nordic data), occurring within just a 
few days. Further, we have been informed by HCPs, that they misunderstand the current statement; 
interpreting it as there is little risk after the first 14 days. We therefore propose to revise the wording 
on TTO. See below (proposed addition underlined; wording to be removed – strikethrough):  
Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed 
following vaccination with Comirnaty. These These conditions cases can develop within just a few days 
after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination. They have more 
often been observed after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men males. Available 
data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from 
myocarditis or pericarditis in general. 
Regarding the proposed addition to section 4.8  
We agree with the detailed description of the Nordic data, including presenting excess risk. It is noted 
that the frequencies are based on excess risk. This is not the general way of estimating frequency, 
which rather is based on the absolute numbers observed / number of exposed. Using excess risk will 
lead to an underestimation of the frequency. If clearly stated, the proposal may be accepted.  
Some small clarifications of the wording are suggested (addition in red, removal in strikethrough):  
The frequency is estimated from a Nordic cohort study of 23.1 million individuals from DK, 
FI, NO and SE. After 2 doses of Spikevax there were estimated 8.49 (95% CI 6.76 – 10.22) 
and 2.13 (95% CI 1.23 – 3.04) excess cases of myocarditis per 100.000 vaccinated in 28 
days inmen and women over the age of 12, respectively, and with a 28 days follow up time, 
were estimated. The increased risk of myocarditis and pericardits after vaccination with 
Spikevax is highest in younger men (see section 4.4). For pPericarditis, in younger males 
given 2 doses  there were estimated 7.04 (95% CI 1.39-12.7) excess cases per 100.000 
vaccinated are estimated within a 28 days follow up periodin younger males after 2 doses of 
Spikevax. For myocarditis in younger males, aftergiven 2 doses of Spikevax there were 
estimated to 18.8 ( 95% CI 9.56 – 28.04) excess cases per 100.000 vaccinated were 
estiamted within 28 days follow up period. The frequency of myocarditis in younger men is 
considered to be within the freqeuncy category “Rare”.  
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The arguments regarding section 4.4 are acknowledged, and it is agreed that the wording can be 
updated and more precisely formulated, as there is now more knowledge regarding the disease 
course. The comments have been taken into consideration in the updated proposal. 
The support to include the Nordic data in the frequency calculation is noted and appreciated. The 
suggested adjustments of the wording in 4.8 are appreciated, however a different approach has 
been taken, to shorten the wording and also to include the data from the French study, in the 
updated proposal, see section 3.4

3.3.4.  MS4 
The PRAC Rapporteur’s AR is generally endorsed. However, we have some additional comments.  
−  We do not agree to include numbers from the unpublished Nordic study, as this gives an 
incomplete picture and is prone to updates. Should the PRAC decide to include incidences this 
should be based on all available data (i.e. EU and non-EU studies) 
−  The last sentence included in section 4.4 (“Based on very limited data … not yet been 
characterized”) is not endorsed, and should be omitted. If included this could create a precedence 
for many products for which risks have not yet been characterized. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The endorsement by the PRAC rap, including the two additional comments, is noted. There are 
considerably less studies on the incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis from Spikevax compared to 
the other mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty. The Nordic and the French studies contribute with a large 
amount of data, also when taking all presented data into consideration. Please see also comment 
below. 
Regarding the last sentence in 4.4., while we agree that this may not be applicable for Comirnaty, 
given the higher exposure, for Spikevax, only very few cases were observed which precludes a 
characterization of the risk at this point in time. The PRAC rapporteur acknowledges the concern that 
the proposed last sentence in section 4.4 could create a precedence for this kind of updates. The 
rapporteur also acknowledges that data on myocarditis/pericarditis in the pediatric population will 
probably change and that this update would need amendments in the future. However, the 
rapporteur considers this information to be important from a public health perspective, especially 
considering the assessment of the extension of indication to children 5-11 years starting soon and 
that countries have started vaccinating <12yo with the other mRNA vaccine. 
3.3.5.  MS1 
Please find below some comments for both Signal pARs regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and 
myo/pericarditis signal: 
•  We concur with MS4 regarding not to include data from Nordic registry. An overall estimate or 
an interval estimated with all available data would be fine for us. 
•  Regarding wording for 4.4, we would support Rapporteur’s proposal. There are many 
uncertainties regarding children administration and we consider it is important this should be 
reflected in the SmPC to be known for other stakeholders. 
PRAC Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
The comment on the Nordic data is noted – please see MS4 comment or comment below for further 
comments. The support for the wording in 4.4 regarding available data in the paediatric population 
is appreciated.

A general comment raised by some member states is that the frequency should not be based solely 
on the Nordic cohort study or that the data should not be explicitly mentioned in the PI. All available 
data presented by the MAH was considered by the PRAC rapporteur when estimating the frequency. 
The PRAC rapporteur chose to reference to the Nordic study as this study is easily comparable to 
Comirnaty and clearly showed the increased risk in younger men when estimating frequency. The 
same is true for the FR case-control study. When considering all the available data in studies 
presented by the MAH on myocarditis, the Nordic study, the French study, Klein et al. and the US 
PASS study were the epidemiological studies presented. See overview of data below:

Nevertheless, the PRAC rapporteur has proposed a new wording to the asterix including data from 
the FR study and the Nordic study with less exact data from the studies than the previous wording. 
These two studies are considered to appropriately reflect the current knowledge of data.  
3.4.  Updated rapporteur's proposed recommendation  
Overall, the new data confirmed previous observations of an increased risk of myocarditis following 
vaccination with Spikevax. The risk was generally higher after the second dose and particulary in 
younger males. The risk of pericarditis showed the same trends. However, the new data made an 
estimation of frequency feasible. 
Therefore the PRAC rapporteur proposes to update the product information of Spikevax regarding the 
risk of myocarditis and pericarditis with the following:  
Summary of product information: 
Section 4.4: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk forVery rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed 
following vaccination with Spikevax. These conditions can develop within just a few days after 
vaccination, and cases have primarily occurred within 14 daysfollowing vaccination. They have more 
often been observed after the second vaccination, and more often in younger malesen (see section 
4.8). Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not 
different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition.  
The risk of myocarditis after a third dose (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms) or booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 
micrograms) of Spikevax has not yet been characterised.  
Based on very limited data in the paediatric population, the risks of myocarditis and 
pericarditis in this population have not yet been characterised.

* The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax is highest in younger 
men (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have 
estimated the risk of myocarditis following vaccination after 2 doses of Spikevax in younger 
males: in one study, there were between 9-28 excess cases of myocarditis within 28 days 
per 100,000 vaccinations; in another study, there were between 129-134 excess cases of 
myocarditis within 7 days per 1,000,000 vaccinations. Based on this, the frequency in 
younger men is considered to be within the frequency category “Rare” (estimated from 
excess cases: ~ 1.9 cases/10,000 and 1.3/10,000, respectively).

Section 2 – Warning and precautions 
There is an increased risk for Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and 
pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have been reported after following 
vaccination with Spikevax. These conditions can develop within just a few days after 
vaccination, and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have more often been 
observed after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4). The 
cases have primarily occurred within two weeks following vaccination, more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often occurred in younger men. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.    
Section 4 - Possible side effects 
Frequency “unknown” Very rare: Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or inflammation of the 
lining outside the heart (pericarditis) which can result in breathlessness, palpitations or chest pain. The 
risk has been shown to be increased in younger males, corresponding to a frequency “Rare”. 
3.5.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered the available evidence from large observational studies in and outside the EEA, as 
well as the data provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH), the PRAC has agreed that the 
MAH for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) Spikevax (Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L.) 
should submit by Monday 6 December (by 9am CET time) a variation to amend the product 
information as described below (new text underlined):

Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There  is  an  increased  risk  for  Very  rare  cases  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  have  been  observed 
following vaccination with Spikevax.

These cases conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and cases have primarily 
occurred within 14 days following vaccination. They have been observed more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men males (see section 4.8).  
Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different 
from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative 
of  myocarditis  or  pericarditis  such  as  (acute  and  persisting)  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  or 
palpitations following vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.  
The  risk  of  myocarditis  after  a  third  dose  (0.5  mL,  100  micrograms)  or  booster  dose  (0.25  mL,  50 
micrograms) of Spikevax has not yet been characterised. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
SOC cardiac disorders:  
[Frequency] not known Very rare: Myocarditis 
[Frequency] not known Very rare: Pericarditis 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Spikevax is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males 
following the second dose of Spikevax. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second 
dose there were about 1.316 (95% CI 1.299 – 1.333) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old 
males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 1.88 (95% CI 0.956 – 2.804) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old 
males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons.

Section 2 – What you need to know before you receive Spikevax 
Warning and precautions 
There is an increased risk Very  rare cases  of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and 
pericarditis (inflammation of the  lining outside the heart)  have  been  reported after vaccination with 
Spikevax (see section 4). 
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in 
younger males. 
 The cases have primarily occurred within two weeks following vaccination, more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often occurred in younger men. 
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

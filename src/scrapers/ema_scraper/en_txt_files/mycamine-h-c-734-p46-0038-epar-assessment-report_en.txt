Description 
Study 9463-CL-2303 was a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multi-Center Study to Compare the 
Efficacy and Safety of Micafungin Versus Amphotericin B Deoxycholate for the Treatment of Neonatal 
Candidiasis. The centers of this multinational study were located Africa (South Africa), Asia Pacific 
(Philippines, Taiwan), Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Romania and Ukraine), Latin 
America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru), Middle East (Israel and Turkey) and 
North America (Canada and United States). 
Study Initiation Date (Date of First Enrollment) was 23 Feb 2013 and Completion Date (Date of Last 
Evaluation) was 15 Dec 2014. 
Note: 
GLP Compliance has been stated by the MAH. 
Methods 
• 
Objectives 
  The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of micafungin in comparison to 
amphotericin B deoxycholate (CAB) in the treatment of proven neonatal candidiasis. 
  The secondary objective was to further evaluate the pharmacokinetics of micafungin, as well as 
CAB, in this subject population. 
• 
Study design 
This was a phase 3, randomized (2:1) multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, non-inferiority study 
comparing the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of micafungin to that of CAB as a treatment for 
candidiasis in neonates and young infants.  
•

Main exclusion criteria were: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Infant with any history of a hypersensitivity or severe vasomotor reaction to any echinocandin 
or systemic CAB product. 
Infant who has received more than 48 h of systemic antifungal therapy prior to the first dose 
of study drug for treatment of the current Candida infection. Cumulative doses were not to 
exceed 2 mg/kg of CAB. For systemic antifungal therapy not specifically stated here, infants 
with more than 2 therapeutic daily doses within the 48 h prior to the first dose of study drug 
were not eligible. 
Infant who had a breakthrough systemic fungal infection while receiving a CAB product or an 
echinocandin as prophylaxis. NB: Infants with a breakthrough fungal infection while receiving 
azole prophylaxis were eligible for enrollment. 
Infant who has failed prior systemic antifungal therapy for this episode of invasive candidiasis, 
including recurrence of the same Candida infection within 2 weeks of completing systemic 
antifungal therapy. 
Infant with a concomitant medical condition, whose participation, in the opinion of the 
Investigator and/or medical advisor, may have created an unacceptable additional risk. 
Infant previously enrolled in this study. 
Infant who was co-infected with a non-Candida fungal organism 
Infant whose positive yeast cultures were solely from an indwelling bladder catheter (unless 
obtained at the time the indwelling catheter was placed) or sputum 
Number of Subjects (Planned, Enrolled and Analyzed):  
Although 225 infants were planned to be randomized to receive either micafungin or CAB, the study 
was terminated early due to challenges with enrollment. Thus, only 30 subjects were treated (20 with 
micafungin and 10 with CAB) and evaluated, which is below the fully powered sample size.  
For this circumstance, the statistical inference based on non-inferiority hypothesis test described was 
not applicable. Thus, there was no intention to conduct statistical comparisons and inferences for this 
study. Where indicated, some key efficacy endpoints were descriptively summarized by treatment 
group, with 95% exact confident intervals for their point estimates. Infants with isolated proven 
candiduria were limited to no more than 20% of the total subjects enrolled. 
The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all randomized infants who were administered any amount 
of study drug. Infants were assigned to the treatment arm based on randomization regardless of actual 
treatment received. 
In the event that an infant was randomized without receiving any study drug, they were excluded from 
FAS. 
FAS was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses and included all 30 evaluable subjects. 
• 
Treatments 
All infants randomized to micafungin received 10 mg/kg per day. All infants randomized to CAB 
received 1 mg/kg per day.

Study drug therapy was administered for a minimum of 21 days to a maximum of 28 days for infants 
without end-organ dissemination. Infants with end-organ dissemination may have received a 
maximum of 42 days of study drug therapy 
CHMP assessment: 
The administered dose of micafungin of 10 mg/kg used in this study does not correspond with the 
proven dose. According to the SmPC the recommended dose for infant for the treatment of candidiasis 
is as follows: 
Use in children (including neonates) and adolescents < 16 years of age 
Treatment of invasive candidiasis 
*If the patient’s response is inadequate, e.g. persistence of cultures or if clinical condition does not 
improve, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day in patients weighing > 40 kg or 4 mg/kg/day in patients 
weighing ≤ 40 kg.

• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy  
The primary endpoint for the study was fungal free survival at one week after the last dose of study 
drug. 
Mycological Response 
Mycological response was assessed during screening, at one week (± 1 day) after the last dose of 
study drug and at the end of study visit (ESV). It was recommended that a minimum of 0.5 mL of 
blood was drawn for culture. 
Mycological response assessments were based on the following definitions: 
● Eradication: Culture or histologically documented absence of the infecting Candida species from 
all positive normally sterile sites during therapy, documented by 2 negative samples, drawn at least 
24 h apart; for Candida meningitis and/or candiduria, 1 negative culture. If culture result did not 
show fungal growth within 72 h of collection, for purposes of determining eradication, the culture 
may have been considered negative. 
● Persistence: Continued isolation or histological documentation from a normally sterile site. 
Cultures from blood, urine and CSF should have been obtained as described below. All other 
procedures, including histology, cytology, and non-culture based diagnostic procedures, were 
performed and documented as clinically appropriate to assess the status of the fungal infection. 
● If baseline CSF culture was positive for Candida, a repeat lumbar puncture should have been 
completed every 4 to 7 days until a negative CSF culture was documented. 
● If the baseline urine culture was positive for Candida, a repeat urine fungal culture was obtained 
every 48 h until 2 negative urine cultures separated by at least 24 h were documented. These 
repeat samples for culture may have been taken via bag specimen. 
● If the baseline blood culture was positive for Candida, a repeat blood fungal culture was obtained 
every 48 h until 2 negative blood cultures separated by at least 24 h were documented.  For infants 
who did not have eradication at 1 week following the last dose of study drug, mycological response

was assessed at the 30 day post-treatment ESV, if clinically indicated. All infants who had 
eradication at the ESV were evaluated for recurrence of the baseline fungal infection throughout the 
30 day post-treatment period. Emergence of fungal infections was evaluated throughout the study 
for all infants. 
Clinical Response 
Clinical response was assessed during screening, weekly while on study drug therapy (±1 day), at 1 
week (±1 day) after the last dose of study drug and at the ESV. Clinical response assessments were 
based on the following definitions: 
● Complete Response: Resolution of all attributable signs related to fungal infection, if present at 
baseline. 
● Partial Response: Improvement in attributable signs related to the fungal infection, if present at 
baseline. 
● Stabilization: Minor improvement or no change in attributable signs related to the fungal 
infection, if present at baseline, and infant continued on therapy without deterioration. 
● Progression: Deterioration in attributable signs related to the fungal infection, if present at 
baseline; or if death occurred presumably related to a fungal infection. 
Assessment of End-organ Dissemination 
Following positive cultures from normally sterile sites (i.e. blood, urine or CSF) for Candida, end-organ 
dissemination should have been assessed and evaluated as follows. 
Abdominal Ultrasound and/or Computed Tomography 
1. Renal ultrasonography consistent with fungal balls (non-shadowing echogenic focus) and/or renal 
parenchymal infiltration (enlarged kidneys with diffusely increased echogenicity). 
2. Liver or splenic ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) consistent with lesions having a 
uniformly decreased attenuation or which showed a central high attenuation dot or well-defined 
lucencies. 
3. Abdominal imaging consistent with abdominal abscess. 
Echocardiogram 
Echocardiogram consistent with valvular vegetation or mural thrombus 
Head Imaging 
Head ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan with abnormalities consistent with 
fungal disease 
Ophthalmoscopy 
Characteristic ocular lesions were identified by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Lesions consistent with 
Candida endophthalmitis included multiple or single, unilateral or bilateral, yellow-white, elevated 
lesions with indistinct borders located on the posterior fundus or other characteristic presentation. Each 
specific finding, documented by 1 of these techniques, was evaluated as follows: 
● Improvement: Improvement in size, number or density of identified lesions. Complete response 
was not expected but may have been documented in the comments section of the eCRF.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/804861/2015 
Page 6/18 
 
 
 
 
 
● Stabilization: Minor improvement or no change in size, number or density of identified lesions. 
● Worsening: Increase in size or number of identified lesions. 
In the neonatal population, antifungal therapy was generally continued for the recommended period 
of time following the conversion at the assessable culture site(s). Imaging, because of slow resolution 
of lesions, has not been useful in guiding duration of medical management [Benjamin et al, 1999]. 
Assessment of Emergent/Recurrent Fungal Infections 
If the infant developed a systemic fungal infection during the treatment or post-treatment period, 
other than the infection recorded at baseline, the infection was recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergent fungal infection 
● An invasive fungal infection which was detected at any time during the study that was a non-
Candida organism, or 
● An invasive fungal infection which was detected during the treatment or post-treatment 
period with a Candida species identified other than those detected at baseline. If this occurred 
within 96 h of the first dose of study drug, the infection was considered part of the final 
diagnosis of enrolling infection and not an emergent infection.  
Recurrent fungal infection 
A recurrent infection was defined as a systemic fungal infection in an infant with eradication at 
the end of study drug therapy, who developed positive blood cultures or a mycologically 
confirmed deep-seated Candida infection, with the same species as the enrolling infection. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Population pharmacokinetic methods were used to develop pharmacokinetic models in this 
subject population using the plasma micafungin and CAB concentration data from this study. 
An investigation was made of the relationship between model parameters and select 
covariates, such as 
demographic factors (e.g., weight) and laboratory parameters’ values. An analysis was made 
of the relationship between drug exposure and efficacy and/or safety response. The 
relationship between plasma and CSF micafungin concentrations and the relationship between 
plasma and CSF CAB concentrations was examined. Details will be described in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis plan. Plasma and CSF micafungin and CAB concentration data were 
listed. 
Safety: 
Clinical safety data (including treatment-emergent adverse events and clinical laboratory evaluations) 
were summarized using descriptive statistics or frequency distributions, as appropriate, for the Safety 
Analysis Set. Hepatic events, renal events, hemolytic events, histamine-release/allergic-type reactions, 
injection site reactions and events infusion-related reactions were assessed as events of interest. 
• 
Statistical Methods 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics included the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, 
minimum and maximum. When needed, the use of other percentiles (e.g.10%, 25%, 75% and 90%) 
were mentioned in the relevant section.

Summaries based on FAS, modified FAS (MFAS) and per protocol set (PPS) (e.g. disposition, baseline 
and efficacy data) were presented by planned treatment group, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Safety analysis and other summaries based on safety analysis set (SAF) were presented by actual 
treatment received. 
The point estimates for fungal free survival and its exact 95% CI were presented by treatment. FAS 
was the primary efficacy analysis population. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints except the time to event variables were presented descriptively by 
treatment group. The point estimate and its exact 95% confidence interval were presented by 
treatment group for overall emergent fungal infection, positive clinical response at the end of 
treatment and one week post the treatment, and eradication at the end of treatment and 1 week post 
end of treatment. 
The summary of clinical response was presented as positive and non-positive responses. The positive 
response was further categorized as complete and partial response; while non-positive responses will 
be further categorized as stabilization, progression, and missing. 
The summary of mycological response data were presented as eradication and noneradication. 
Non-eradication was further subcategorized as persistence and missing. K-M curves by treatment 
group for time to positive clinical response and time to eradication was generated. 
Model parameters such as clearance and volume of distribution used the pharmacokinetic analysis set 
(PKAS) analysis set. 
All analysis of safety will be presented by treatment group for SAF, unless specified otherwise.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints assessed in this study included time to mycological clearance of invasive 
candidiasis, fungal free survival and status of follow-up imaging and exams (improved, stable, worse) 
in infants with end-organ dissemination as well as clinical (complete, partial, stabilization, progression) 
and mycological responses at end of study drug therapy and one week after last dose of study drug, 
overall incidence of emergent and recurrent fungal infections through the end of study and time to 
positive clinical response (complete or partial). 
The Investigator’s assessment of fungal free survival among micafungin-treated subjects was in 
agreement with that of the DRP (Data Review Panel). 
Per DRP, 11 (61.1%) micafungin-treated infants that experienced clinical signs and symptoms at 
baseline achieved a positive (either complete or partial) response at end of study drug therapy and one 
week after the last dose of study drug. Of the 7 (38.9%) micafungin-treated subjects with who did not 
have a positive response, 1 (5.6%) was stable at each of these evaluable timepoints, and 3 (16.7%) 
subjects progressed at end of study drug therapy and 1 (5.6%) subject progressed one week after the 
last dose of study drug. Details for subjects who did not have a positive response were missing for 3 
(16.7%) micafungin-treated subjects at end of study drug therapy and for 5 (27.8%) subjects a week 
after the last dose of study drug. 
Of the subjects treated with CAB, 7 (70.0%) subjects who had baseline clinical signs and symptoms 
achieved a positive (complete) response at end of study drug therapy and one week after the last dose 
of study drug while 1 (10.0%) was stable and 2 (20.0%) subjects progressed at each of these 
timepoints per DRP. 
Of note, Investigator’s assessment of clinical response was similar to that of the DRP. 
Eleven (55.0%) and 8 (80.0%) of micafungin- and CAB-treated subjects, respectively achieved 
eradication at end of study drug therapy and 1 week after the last dose of study drug. Of the 9 
(45.0%) micafungin-treated subjects at both timepoints with mycological failure, infection persisted in 
2 (10.0%) and was not assessed in 7 (35.0%) individuals. For CAB-treated subjects with mycological 
failure, all exhibited persistence at both time points. 
A total of 7 micafungin-treated subjects, but no CAB-treated subjects, were assessed by the DRC as “
not assessed” one week after the last dose. Of these subjects, 3 subjects (57020004, 57020008, 
90010028) had one post-baseline negative blood culture, but a follow-up blood culture to verify 
eradication was not obtained, for 2 other subjects (30030005, 11020016), no post baseline samples 
were obtained, and for 2 more subjects (36060013, 36060021), blood culture samples continued to be 
positive. Of note, Subjects 57020004 and 36060013 showed a complete clinical response, and 
Subjects 90010028 and 36060021 showed progression of clinical sign and symptoms one week after 
last dose.  
The Investigator’s assessments were generally similar to those of the DRP. 
Recurrent infections were not noted by the Investigator or the DRP (either through the end of study, 
within one week of EOT or after one week of EOT) in the micafungin-treated infants. Recurrent fungal 
infection was noted by the DRP and the Investigator in 1 CAB-treated infant (Subject 10220015) 
through end of study and after the one week post-end of treatment visit. C. glabrata was identified as 
the infection-causing species with the site of recurrent infection in this subject being localized to the 
urinary tract. The CAB minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value against C. glabrata organism at 
screening by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Susceptibility Testing methods was 1 μg/mL and 0.25 μg/mL, respectively. One week post end 
treatment, this subject was alive with no alternative antifungal therapy for treatment. The infection 
was eradicated one week after the last dose of study drug but was recurrent at end of study. 
Per DRP, the 25th percentile of time to mycological clearance among the infants in both treatment 
groups was 3.0 days. 
Per DRP, fungal free survival in infants with end-organ dissemination was assessed in 7 and 3 subjects 
on micafungin and CAB, respectively. Of these, 3 (42.9%) micafungin-treated subjects and 1(33.3%) 
CAB-treated subject achieved fungal free survival at both end of study drug therapy and 1 week after 
the last dose of study drug. Of note, status of success or failure at end of study drug therapy was 
missing for 3 (42.9%) subjects on micafungin. 
Of the micafungin-treated subjects with end-organ assessments, improvement was noted in 4 (57.1%) 
subjects, with an additional 1 (14.3%) subject each either being stable, worse or not assessed at 
follow-up per DRP. In contrast, 1 (33.3%) CAB-treated subject with end-organ assessment was noted 
as having improved and 2 (66.7%) subjects worsened. 
Fungal isolates collected from both treatment groups were tested for susceptibility with various 
antifungal compounds and details can be found in. For micafungin-treated subjects, MIC values for 23 
baseline isolates met the susceptible criteria (according to CLSI criteria) for all isolates from subjects in 
this treatment group. For the CAB-treated subjects, all of the 13 baseline isolates tested were below 
the epidemiological cut-off values for CAB as described by Pfaller and colleagues [Pfaller et al, 2012]. 
No clinical breakpoints have been established for CAB and any Candida species. 
Time to positive clinical response (complete or partial) based on DRP assessment was not 
evaluated due to insufficient data. 
• 
Safety results 
Overall, 18 (90.0%) and 9 (90.0%) micafungin- and CAB-treated infants, respectively, experienced at 
least a single treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The proportion of micafungin- and CAB-
treated subjects experiencing individual AEs were similar [Table 4]. 
The majority of TEAEs noted in this study in either treatment arm were considered to be study drug-
related by the Investigator.

Sorting order: descending frequency for test drug total group by SOC and by PT. In the case of ties, an alphabetical order 
was applied. 
Overall, 12 (60.0%) of micafungin-treated subjects and 7 (70.0%) of CAB-treated subjects 
experienced at least a single SAE [Table 5]. For one subject with concurrent sepsis (Subject 
36060017), elevated LDH was observed concurrently with an event of anemia, potentially indicating a 
hemolytic nature of the event. The overall rate of individual SAEs among the CAB-treated subjects was 
comparable to that among the micafungin treated infants. All events of anemia in all subjects and 
treatment groups resolved. In the micafungin treatment group, anemia was the most common SAE 
noted experienced by 4 (20.0%) infants; the remaining reported SAEs in this treatment group were 
experienced by no more than 2 (10.0%) subjects each. 
One subject on CAB (10160007) and 3 subjects (36060021, 36060017, 90010028) on micafungin died 
while on study. Of note, none of the events leading to death were considered to be study-drug related 
by the Investigator. Of the micafungin-treated subjects who succumbed to death, 1 subject each 
experienced underlying gastrointestinal necrosis (confirmed on day 31), cardiovascular insufficiency on 
study day 3 and septic shock on study day 3. Neither cardiovascular insufficiency nor septic shock was 
considered to be as drug-related TEAEs leading to death by the Investigator. 
In total, 9 (45.0%) and 6 (60.0%) micafungin- and CAB-treated subjects discontinued treatment. Five 
(25.0%) and 3 (30.0%) subjects on micafungin and CAB, respectively, permanently discontinued study 
drug due to a TEAE. The majority of events among micafungin-treated subjects were considered to be 
probably related to study drug exposure by the Investigator. None of the events leading to 
discontinuation among CAB-treated subjects were considered to be study-drug related. No important 
differences in the proportion of micafungin-treated infants and CAB-treated infants experiencing 
increases in liver enzyme abnormalities or increases in creatinine were observed.

Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH discusses the clinical aspects of this submission and concludes:  
The original sample size for this study was 225 infants; however, this study was terminated early due 
to enrollment challenges. Only 30 subjects were enrolled and received study drug. Therefore, no 
inferential statistical testing was carried out, and all interpretations of results should be done with 
caution. No meaningful differences between treatment groups for demographic and baseline 
characteristics were observed. Seventy-five (75%) micafungin-treated and 100% CAB-treated subjects 
were less than or equal to 4 weeks of age. Of note, more micafungin-treated infants than CAB-treated 
infants were infected with C. parapsilosis. 
Twelve out of 20 micafungin-treated infants (60%, CI [36, 81]) and 7 out of 10 CAB-treated subjects 
(70% CI [35, 93]) responded to treatment, as assessed by fungal-free survival at 1 week after the 
EOT by the DRP. These response rates were confirmed in the MFAS set as well as in the Investigator-
assessed analyses. While the point estimates for the percentages of infants responding to treatment

were similar in the micafungin and CAB groups, the confidence intervals were wide due to the small 
sample size in each arm.  
The results observed for the primary endpoint are corroborated by the clinical response rate. Eleven 
out of 18 micafungin-treated subjects (61% CI [36, 83]) and 7 out of 10 CAB-treated infants (70% CI 
[35, 93]) showed a clinical response at the EOT and one week thereafter. These numbers were similar 
regardless of DRP or Investigator assessment. Of note, within the PPS, all infants enrolled in this study 
with clinical signs and symptoms at baseline achieved a complete clinical response as assessed by the 
DRP. 
Fewer micafungin-treated infants (11/20, 55% CI [32, 77]) than CAB-treated infants (8/10, 80% CI 
[44.4, 97.5]) achieved a mycological response. It should be noted however, that 7 out of 9 
micafungin-treated infants with mycological failure were actually due to mycological response not 
assessed while all CAB-treated infants with mycological failure exhibited persistence. Of the 7 not 
assessed in the micafungin arm, 3 of them appeared to have eradicated but were lacking a 
confirmatory culture. 
Among those infants with mycological eradication outcome at the EOT, one infant in the CAB treatment 
group experienced a recurrent infection. There were no recurrent fungal infections in the micafungin 
treatment group. One infant in the micafungin treatment group experienced an emergent fungal 
infection during the treatment period vs none in the CAB-treated group. 
Efficacy in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia was observed in both the micafungin 
and CAB treatment groups regardless of fungal species, infection site, age, gender, race, gestational 
age, or geographic region. 
A similar proportion of micafungin-treated infants and CAB-treated infants experienced an AE. No 
differences between groups were observed when individual adverse events were compared. In 
addition, no differences between groups were observed when SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal were 
compared. No differences between groups were observed for AEs of special interest, and no infant 
experienced an event of hemolytic anemia. 
Three infants in the micafungin-treatment group and 1 in the CAB-treatment group died. All deaths 
were attributable to complications of prematurity or concurrent medical conditions. 
No differences between the micafungin- and CAB-treatment groups were observed in the shift analyses 
of safety labs. Differences in the proportion of micafungin-treated infants and CAB-treated infants 
experiencing increases in liver enzyme abnormalities or increases in creatinine were not clinically 
relevant due to concomitant conditions and medications known to affect liver enzyme elevations. 
Increases from baseline in serum creatinine were generally similar between groups. No important 
changes in vital signs were observed.  
CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The CHMP agrees with the overall conclusion by the MAH.  
However, although the study was well- designed (no obviously deficiencies could be 
identified) it should be noted that the number of evaluable patients was too low for an 
outcome of validated data on efficacy and safety at a dosage of 10 mg/kg for the treatment 
of neonatal candidiasis. So, the benefit risk ratio is unpredictable.

Recommendation  
In our point of view, the authorized application of micafungin should not be changed.  
  The PAM is Fulfilled – No regulatory action required. 
However, although P46-038 has now been fulfilled with this submitted MAH’s Follow-up information, 
the comment by a Member state should be taken into consideration (please see below). 
There were the following Member State comments on the Preliminary AR: 
MS (Co-Rapp): The MS agrees with the Rapporteur and has no further comments to make. 
MS2: The MS agrees with the Rapporteur that the current study does not allow for conclusions 
regarding the comparative safety of Micafungin vs. Amphotericin B. 
However, several publications have pointed towards a higher clearance in premature infants as well as 
in neonates (See below), and suggest that the current dose recommendations of 2 mg/kg/day are 
insufficient for children < 4 months of age or for premature infants, in particular if the CNS is involved. 
The present ESCMID clinical guidelines recommend a dose of 4-10 mg/kg/day – which is higher than 
currently approved in the SmPC.  Considering the concerns of the optimal dose in this age group , 
irrespective of the present study that failed due to insufficient recruitment, we are of the opinion that 
further discussion is needed on the appropriateness of the current dose recommendation for infants <4 
months in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis.

Indeed, off label use with higher dose level than currently recommended is reported. However, it 
cannot be denied that such an off label use translates the concerns at the scientific community level 
that the currently recommended dose might be sub-optimal in those very young children. 
This has triggered the present study which could not be conclusive given the limited enrolment. 
Moreover, this has triggered dedicated investigations within the scientific community with a European 
institutional multicenter study recently validated through a VHP procedure with higher doses of 
micafungin than currently approved (10 mg/kg after a loading dose).  
Although this study cannot be conclusive the level of response with a 10 mg/kg to some extent further 
echoes the concern that the lower dose as currently recommended could be suboptimal. Moreover, the 
safety data with this higher dose do not raise particular concern, notably liver toxicity. 
Overall, it is very concerning to consider that very young children could be exposed to sub-optimal 
dose (given the life threatening nature of the disease). We consider that the applicant should be 
requested to further substantiate the dose in premature and neonates by an updated review 
of the literature and dedicated PK investigations. A post authorisation measure should be 
set to this purpose. 
CHMP’s comment: 
We support the opinion of the MS2 and MS3 that the appropriate dosing for infants < 4 months for the 
treatment of neonatal candidiasis should be discussed.  
A respective review has been requested as outcome of the variation EMEA/H/C/000734/II/26 on the 
RMP finalised in July 2015 and it has been agreed with EMA and Rapporteur to extend the submission 
of this review by the end of 2015. In this context the MAH has explained within the cover letter for 
P46-038: 
“Astellas is evaluating all neonatal data including the 2303 study results, and the conclusions will be 
presented separately later this year, applying appropriate submission procedures.” 
The MAH is therefore reminded to submit the requested review as an outcome of 
EMEA/H/C/000734/II/26 by the end of 2015 including also a discussion on the adequacy of the actual 
recommended dose of 2 mg/kg to max 4 mg/kg for the treatment of candidiasis in children <4 
months (including neonates and premature infants) in comparison to a dose of > 4 mg/kg (to 10 
mg/kg). For this review the pharmacokinetics (incl. metabolism) of micafungin in this age group, the 
efficacy and in particular the safety should be considered.  
Additional clarifications requested 
Regarding the need for an optimal dose for children < 4 months (incl. neonates and premature) further 
clarification on this issue is required and has been already requested as outcome of 
EMEA/H/C/000734/II/26. 
Thus, the MAH is reminded to submit the requested review as outcome of EMEA/H/C/000734/II/26 by 
the end of 2015 including a discussion on the adequacy of the actual recommended dose of 2 mg/kg to 
max 4 mg/kg for the treatment of candidiasis in children <4 months (including neonates and 
premature infants) in comparison to a dose of > 4 mg/kg (to 10 mg/kg). For this review the 
pharmacokinetics (incl. metabolism) of micafungin in this age group, the efficacy and in particular the 
safety should be considered.

Long-term effectiveness study in individuals 50 years of 
age or older 
In a large-scale US prospective observational cohort study 
of the long-term effectiveness of ZOSTAVAX, individuals 50 
years of age or older at the time of vaccination were 
followed for the occurrence of HZ and PHN using validated 
endpoints. 
Out of 1,505,647 study individuals, 507,444 received 
ZOSTAVAX between 2007 and 2018. A total of 75,135 
confirmed HZ cases and 4,954 confirmed PHN cases (> 90 
days of zoster-associated pain) were observed. The results

- Section 4.8: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, study, 
98 adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose 
of ZOSTAVAX 42 days following the initial dose; the vaccine 
was generally well tolerated. The frequency of vaccine-
related adverse experiences after the second dose of 
ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that seen with the first 
dose. 
In an open-label study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as a 
booster dose to 201 HZ history-negative subjects 70 years 
of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 
10 years previously, and as a first dose to 199 HZ history-
negative subjects 70 years of age or older. The vaccine was 
generally well tolerated; the frequency of vaccine-related 
adverse experiences after the booster dose of ZOSTAVAX 
was generally similar to that seen with the first dose.     
- Section 5.1: Immunogenicity in Subjects Receiving a 
Booster Dose 
In an open-label study, ZOSTAVAX was administered  as: 
(1) a booster dose to 201 HZ history-negative subjects 70 
years of age or older who had received a first dose 
approximately 10 years previously as participants in the 
SPS, and (2) a first dose to 199 HZ history-negative 
subjects 70 years of age or older. The antibody response to 
vaccine 6 weeks postvaccination as measured by gpELISA 
was comparable in the booster dose and first dose group 
(GMT of 389.1 vs 368.8 gpELISA units/mL, respectively). 
The geometric mean fold-rise of the VZV antibody 
response, as measured by gpELISA, from prevaccination to 
Week 6 postvaccination  was 1.5 (95% CI: [1.4 to 1.6]) in

safety of Zostavax in subjects 50 to 59 years old.  
The efficacy data from this study demonstrated that based 
on a sample size of 129 cases a vaccine efficacy for Herpes 
Zoster (VEHZ) of 69.8% was achieved in the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population over a 1.3 year follow-up. According to the 
initial sample size calculation the trial should be continued 
until 96 evaluable cases of HZ were observed. The 
extended number of events was due to on-going 
operational activities of suspected HZ cases following 
confirmation of the planned 96 HZ cases. Vaccine efficacy 
based on the first 96 HZ cases was comparable with the VE 
calculated on the 129 HZ cases accrued in the study.  VEHZ 
calculated on the basis of the first 96 HZ cases was 70.3 % 
(95% CI: [54.7%, 82.4%]). In comparison based on 129 
HZ cases accrued the overall estimated VEHZ was 69.8% 
(95% CI: [54.1%, 80.6%]).

however it is still unknown which antibody titres or CMI

In view of safety, the CHMP considered that overall the 
findings from this study are consistent with the known 
safety profile of Zostavax. As anticipated, a slightly higher 
reactogenicity has been found in subjects 50 to 59 years 
old compared to subjects ≥ 60 years of age.  The Product

systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose equivalent 
of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to 
enrolment, and 6 weeks or more following vaccination to 
assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of Zostavax. 
In view of immunogenicity, compared with placebo, 
Zostavax induced a higher varicella zoster virus (VZV-) 
specific gpELISA antibody geometric mean titre (GMT) at 6 
weeks postvaccination (GMT of 531.1 vs. 224.3 gpELISA 
units/ml, respectively). The Geometric mean fold-rise of 
immune response following vaccination as measured by 
gpELISA was 2.3-fold (95% CI: [2.0 to 2.7]) compared to 
1.1-fold (95% CI: [1.0 to 1.2]) in the placebo group. 
The safety profile seen in this study was generally

Since approval of ZOSTAVAX in 2006, several adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) have been added to the reference safety 
information, however the post-authorisation safety data 
regarding the use of ZOSTAVAX within the EU are limited 
and it cannot be excluded that additional ADRs may be 
detected. 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
6-monthly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of ZOSTAVAX, 
which requires the submission of 6-monthly PSURs, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

Following a post-marketing report on a case of possible 
safety report about a secondary transmission of Oka 
vaccine strain varicella zoster virus (VZV) from a 
vaccinee who did not develop a rash post vaccination 
with varicella virus vaccine live (Oka/Merck) to a 
healthy non-vaccinee. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
secondary transmission of the OKA strain related to 
vaccination with Varivax, the MAH proposed to update the 
SmPC subsection on transmission.  
Zostavax and Varivax both contain the attenuated varicella 
virus strain OKA/Merck. Although there is currently no 
report of secondary transmission of this vaccine strain 
following administration of Zostavax a theoretical risk 
remains. Therefore the CHMP endorsed the proposed 
update of Zostavax SmPC section 4.4 to reflect the 
possibility of secondary transmission following vaccination.

immunogenicity of Zostavax when administered

age or older showed that the level of Varicella zoster virus 
(VZV) antibody response in subjects who received Zostavax 
concomitantly with Pneumovax 23 was inferior, to the VZV 
antibody response in subjects who received the vaccines 
nonconcomitantly.  Levels of VZV antibody response in the 
concomitant group were consistent with levels seen in 
previous studies of Zostavax, but did not meet the 
noninferiority criterion pre-specified in this study. Although 
the geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of the VZV antibody 
response in the concomitant group was acceptable, the 
GMFR was noticeably lower than in the non-concomitant 
group (1.9 vs. 3.1). Concomitant administration did not

September 2008 there have been a total of 10 
postmarketing reports from healthcare providers identified 
for zoster vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in the MAH's adverse 
event database with the preferred term 
"lymphadenopathy". Of those reports, 6 were identified to 
be temporally related to vaccination with the vaccine. The 
average time of onset from vaccination to detection of 
lymphadenopathy was 3 days with a range of 2 to 6 days. . 
The average time of onset supports the acuity of this event. 
The term "lymphadenopathy' was therefore included in the 
SPC under the MedDRA SOC "Blood and lymphatic 
disorders with the frequency category "unknown" as no 
frequency could be determined based on clinical studies.

zoster virus (VZV) -naïve adults. 
Based on the review of clinical data 2.4 % of vaccinated 
subjects were found to be seronegative and additional 
1.7% of patients were low-seropositive at the time of 
vaccination in one of the studies. This group of patients are 
considered to be at risk for developing varicella or other 
adverse experiences associated with wild type VZV 
infection. In terms of safety, systemic clinical adverse 
experiences reported were generally similar in incidence 
and spectrum to those reported by VZV-experienced 
subjects in this limited dataset. No subjects reported 
varicella-like or herpes zoster-like rashes.  No serious 
vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. 
The available safety information on VZV-seronegative and 
low seropositive adult subjects ?30 years old enrolled in 
clinical trials of a live attenuated varicella vaccine was 
included in the SPC.

after administration of Zostavax the CHMP considered that 
the four adverse event terms: pyrexia, hypersensitivity, 
anaphylactic reaction and rash should be added to the SPC 
under the Post Marketing Reports section of the 
“undesirable effects” Section 4.8 of the SPC.  
Pyrexia was observed in 17 cases during the observation 
period from market introduction to 19 October 2007, with 
an onset occurring in close temporal relationship of a few 
hours to one week. Hypersensitivity was reported in 8 
cases during this period, including immediate anaphylactic 
reactions requiring immediate treatment, as well as 
hypersensitivity reactions occurring few hours or days after 
vaccination. For the time period from market introduction 
to 31 March 2008 post marketing reports with the following 
preferred terms: rash pruritic (46 reports), rash popular 
(17 reports), rash maculo-papular (7 reports), rash 
macular (14 reports), rash generalised (38 reports), and 
rash erythematous (14 reports) have been observed. 
The CHMP considered that the data and analyses provided 
were considered satisfactory to support the proposed 
changes.

To update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC to include 
the information on the safety and immunogenicity of 
Zostavax when administered to patients with a 
history of Herpes Zoster (HZ) prior to administration 
based on a clinical study in subjects with a previous 
episode of HZ. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the PL to include a description of the 
medicinal product before reconstitution and a 
statement regarding the inspection of the vaccine 
components before use. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to update the contact details of local 
representatives (AT, CZ and DK) in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
immunogenicity of Zostavax was supported by a double-
blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover, 
multicentre phase III study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of one dose of Zostavax in 
subjects who experienced a previous episode of HZ. 
Subjects in the first group received at the beginning and at 
week 4 of the trial a single, subcutaneous injection of 
Zostavax and subjects in the second group received 
placebo. 
All subjects were followed for serious adverse experiences, 
for exposure to varicella or HZ, or development of any 
varicella/varicella-like or HZ/HZ-like rashes, as well as any 
other adverse experiences for 28 days after each injection. 
The study data indicated that the proportions of subjects 
reporting specific systemic clinical adverse experiences 
were generally comparable between the two vaccination 
groups and strata. Zostavax was generally well tolerated 
when administered to HZ history-positive adults ? 50 years 
of age. 
The CHMP further considered that the frequencies and 
types of adverse experiences reported in this study were 
consistent with what has been seen in other Zostavax 
studies. 
Overall, following administration of Zostavax in patients 
Page 39/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with HZ-positive history no significant differences in safety 
data of patient in relation to the time period passed 
between the previous HZ infections could be identified.  The 
CHMP therefore supported the proposed change of the 
Product Information.

Both, Zostavax and influenza vaccines are indicated for

and inactivated influenza vaccine following the 
results of a clinical study, which evaluated the safety 
and efficacy of concomitant administration of 
ZOSTAVAX with flu vaccine in adults =50 years of 
age. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the 
contact details of local representatives  in the 
Package Leaflet. In addition the MAH completed the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet to 
include the two new EU Member States (Bulgaria and 
Romania) and changed the format according to the 
older persons carrying particular risks for herpes zoster and 
influenza. Influenza vaccines are specifically recommended 
for individuals older than 60 years of age, while specific 
recommendations for Zostavax do not yet exist. The 
concept to administer both vaccines during the same 
consultation was considered reasonable and was clinically 
investigated. As no differences with regard to 
immunogenicity and safety were observed in the 
concomitant versus sequential use of both vaccines, the 
CHMP considered that Zostavax can be given concomitantly 
with inactivated influenza vaccines licensed in the EU. The

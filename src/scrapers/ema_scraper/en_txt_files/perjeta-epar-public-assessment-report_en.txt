Executive Summary  
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  form  of  malignancy  in  women,  with  a  global  prevalence  of  more 
than 1.3 million patients and a mortality rate of approximately 450,000 deaths per year (Ferlay et al, 
2010). In Europe, more than 80,000 deaths from breast cancer are expected in 2011 (Malvezzi et al, 
2011).  Most  breast  cancers  are  diagnosed  when  the  cancer  is  still  confined  to  the  breast,  with  or 
without  loco-regional  lymph  node  spread  (Howlader  et  al,  2011;  Sant  et  al,  2003).  At  this  stage  the 
disease  is  usually  operable  and  can  be  treated  with  curative  intent.  However,  around  20%-45%  of 
patients  experience  relapse  (EBCTCG,  2011a,  2011b)  and  those  with  metastatic  or  unresectable 
disease are generally incurable. Patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of around 24 
months and a 5-year life expectancy of 18%-23% (Howlader et al, 2011; Sant et al, 2003). 
In December 2012, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) recommended the authorisation of pertuzumab (Perjeta) in combination with trastuzumab and 
docetaxel  in  adult  patients  with  HER2-positive  metastatic  or  locally  recurrent  unresectable  breast 
cancer,  who  have  not  received  previous  anti-HER2  therapy  or  chemotherapy  for  their  metastatic 
disease.  
Pertuzumab is subject to restricted medical prescription and therapy should only be initiated under the 
supervision of a physician experienced in the administration of anti-cancer agents. Pertuzumab should 
be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis and in an environment 
where  full  resuscitation  service  is  immediately  available.  The  recommended  initial  loading  dose  of 
pertuzumab  is  840  mg  administered  as  a  60  minute  intravenous  infusion,  followed  every  3  weeks 
thereafter by a maintenance dose of 420 mg administered over a period of 30 to 60 minutes. 
The  HER2  receptor  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most  important  targets  for  the  treatment  of  breast 
cancer. HER2 is involved in regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation (Sundaresan et al, 1999). 
HER2  overexpression/amplification 
(‘HER2-positivity’) 
is  associated  with 
increased 
tumor 
aggressiveness,  higher  rates  of  recurrence,  and  increased  mortality  (Borg  et  al,  1990;  Ross  et  al, 
1998; Menard et al, 2001; Brown et al, 2008; Curigliano et al, 2009; Ross et al, 2009).  
Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2.  It prevents dimerisation of  HER2 with other 
members of the HER family. These dimers are responsible for signal transduction via critical pathways 
that  are  involved  in  the  survival,  growth  and  division  of  breast  cancer  cells.  Pertuzumab  results  in  a 
more complete inhibition of the HER2 axis when combined with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, 
which binds to a different epitope. Pertuzumab is also able to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
The demonstration of clinical benefit for pertuzumab was based on a single randomized controlled trial 
comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pertuzumab  +  trastuzumab  +  docetaxel  vs.  placebo  + 
trastuzumab  +  docetaxel  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  HER2-
positive breast cancer. Patients with clinically important cardiac risk factors or brain metastases were 
not included in the trial. 
Pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  were  given  at  standard  doses  in  a  3-weekly  regimen.  Patients  were 
treated  with  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  until  disease  progression,  withdrawal  of  consent  or 
unmanageable toxicity. Docetaxel was given as an initial dose of 75 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion 
every three weeks for at least 6 cycles. The dose of docetaxel could be escalated to 100 mg/m2 at the 
investigator’s discretion if the initial dose was well tolerated.

The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an independent 
review  facility  and  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  disease 
progression  or  death  (from  any  cause)  if  the  death  occurred  within  18  weeks  of  the  last  tumour 
assessment.  
In  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  addition  of  pertuzumab  to  trastuzumab+docetaxel  resulted  in  a 
38% improvement in PFS compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.75; p < 0.0001). 
The median PFS was 18.5 months in the pertuzumab group compared to 12.4 months in the placebo 
group.  The  result  of  the  primary  analysis  was  supported  by  the  results  of  secondary  endpoints, 
including  overall  survival  (hazard  ratio  =  0.66;  95%  CI:  0.52,  0.84;  p=  0.0008)  and  objective 
response  rate  (80.2%  vs.  69.3%  for  the  pertuzumab  group  vs.  placebo  group,  respectively).  The 
proportion  of  patients  alive  at  12,  24  and  36  months,  respectively,  was  94%,  81%  and  66%  for  the 
pertuzumab group compared to 89%, 69% and 50% in the placebo group.  
The main concern in the assessment of efficacy has been that the patient population of the pivotal trial 
appeared to have been undertreated compared to the current standard of care in Europe. Only about 
half of patients in the pivotal study had received prior (neo-) adjuvant therapy, and the vast majority 
of  patients  were  trastuzumab-naïve.  However,  exploratory  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  major 
differences in efficacy according to prior trastuzumab treatment. Thus, the efficacy of pertuzumab was 
considered  established  in  the  overall  patient  population  as  well  as  in  patients  pre-treated  with 
trastuzumab. The results of two ongoing studies will be submitted as a post-marketing commitment to 
further confirm the efficacy of pertuzumab in patients pre-treated with trastuzumab. 
Common  adverse  events  (incidence  >25%)  observed  in  the  pivotal  trial  were  alopecia  (60.5%  in  the 
placebo arm, 60.9% in the pertuzumab arm), diarrhoea (46.3%/66.8%), neutropenia (49.6%/52.8%), 
nausea  (41.6%/42.3%),  fatigue  (36.8%/37.6%),  rash  (24.2%/33.7%),  asthenia  (30.2%/26.0%), 
decreased  appetite  (26.4%/29.2%),  peripheral  oedema  (30.0%/23.1%)  and  mucosal  inflammation 
19.9%/27.8%). Overall, the toxicity profile was similar between groups except for higher incidence in 
diarrhoea,  rash,  mucosal  inflammation,  dry  skin  and  neutropenia  associated  with  the  pertuzumab 
group. No significant difference in severe or life-threatening toxicity was observed between the placebo 
and  pertuzumab  arms  (72.0%  and  73.5%,  respectively)  although  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
severe  or  life-threatening  febrile  neutropenia  and  diarrhoea  was  higher  in  the  pertuzumab  group 
compared to the placebo group. Adverse events resulting in death were observed in 2.5% of patients 
in the placebo arm and in 2.0% of patients in the pertuzumab arm. 
In terms of balance of benefits and risks, the totality of data indicated that pertuzumab was associated 
with clinically and statistically significant benefits in a patient population with limited treatment options. 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the risk-benefit balance of pertuzumab, in 
combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic or locally 
recurrent  unresectable  breast  cancer,  who  have  not  received  previous  anti-HER2  therapy  or 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, was considered to be positive.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) 
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  form  of  malignancy  in  women,  with  a  global  prevalence  of  more 
than 1.3 million patients and a mortality rate of approximately 450,000 deaths per year (Ferlay et al, 
2010). In Europe, more than 80,000 deaths from breast cancer are expected in 2011 (Malvezzi et al, 
2011). Most breast cancers in the Western world (around 94%-95% of patients in the US and Europe) 
are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the breast, with or without loco-regional lymph node 
spread  (Howlader  et  al,  2011;  Sant  et  al,  2003).  At  this  stage  (‘early  breast  cancer’  [EBC]),  the 
disease  is  usually  operable  and  can  be  treated  with  curative  intent.  However,  around  20%-45%  of 
patients  experience  relapse  (EBCTCG,  2011a,  2011b)  and  those  with  metastatic  or  unresectable 
disease are generally incurable. Patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of around 24 
months and a 5-year life expectancy of 18%-23% in the US and Europe (Howlader et al, 2011; Sant et 
al, 2003). 
The  HER2  receptor  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most  important  targets  for  the  treatment  of  breast 
cancer. HER2 is involved in regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation (Sundaresan et al, 1999). 
Amplification and/or overexpression of HER2 occurs in around 15% to 20% of breast cancers (Wolff et 
al,  2007;  Chia  et  al,  2008;  Ross  et  al,  2009)  and  is  a  hallmark  of  the  HER2-positive  and  luminal-B 
intrinsic  sub-types  of  breast  cancer  (Sorlie  et  al,  2004).  HER2  overexpression/amplification  (‘HER2-
positivity’)  is  associated  with  increased  tumor  aggressiveness,  higher  rates  of  recurrence,  and 
increased  mortality  (Borg  et  al,  1990;  Ross  et  al,  1998;  Menard  et  al,  2001;  Brown  et  al,  2008; 
Curigliano et al, 2009; Ross et al, 2009).  
Although  improved  early  detection  and  advances  in  systemic  therapy  for  early-stage  disease  have 
resulted in a decline in breast cancer mortality in recent years (Levi et al, 2005; Malvezzi et al, 2011), 
MBC (Metastatic Breast Cancer) (of all sub-types) remains essentially incurable. Despite improvements 
in  progression-free  and  overall  survival  with  trastuzumab-based  and  lapatinib-based  therapies,  some 
patients with HER2-positive MBC never respond to these targeted agents, and almost all patients with 
HER2-positive  MBC  will  eventually  progress  and  die  of  breast  cancer.  Of  the  450,000  global  deaths 
from breast cancer each year (Ferlay et al, 2010), around 15%-20% (60,000~90,000) are likely to be 
due  to  HER2-positive  disease.  This  translates  to  around  12,000-15,000  deaths  per  annum  in  Europe 
and  6,000-8,000  deaths  per  annum  in  the  US.  The  median  age  of  patients  presenting  with  HER2-
positive  breast  cancer  is  in  the  mid-50s,  around  five  years  younger  than  the  general  breast  cancer 
population (Neven et al, 2008; Kwan et al, 2009). At a time when the actuarial survival for women is 
over  80  years  of  age,  the  median  loss  of  life-years  per  patient  is  around  two  decades.  New  active 
agents are, therefore, urgently required to improve disease control and extend survival in patients with 
HER2-positive MBC. 
About the product 
Pertuzumab (Ptz) is a recombinant, humanized, IgG mAb which also targets HER2, but Ptz binds to a 
different  epitope  (domain  II)  than  Trastuzumab  (T)  and  prevents  dimerisation  of  HER2  with  other 
members  of  the  HER  family  (HER1  (=EGFR),  HER3  and  HER4).  These  dimers  (homodimerisation  or 
heterodimerisation) are responsible for signal transduction via critical pathways (MAP kinase and PI3K)

that  are  involved  in  the  survival,  growth  and  division  of  BC  cells.  Ptz  results  in  a  more  complete 
inhibition  of  the  HER2  axis  when  combined  with  T  (dual  HER2  blockade).  Ptz  is  also  able  to  induce 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
Initially, the Applicant claimed pertuzumab was indicated in combination with Herceptin and docetaxel 
for patients with HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer who have not 
received previous treatment or whose disease has relapsed after adjuvant therapy. 
Subsequently, as a result of the evaluation procedure, the approved indication states as follows: 
Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in adult patients with HER2-
positive  metastatic  or  locally  recurrent  unresectable  breast  cancer,  who  have  not  received  previous 
anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.  
Perjeta  is  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  and  therapy  should  only  be  initiated  under  the 
supervision  of  a  physician  experienced  in  the  administration  of  anti-cancer  agents.  Perjeta  should  be 
administered  by  a  healthcare  professional  prepared  to  manage  anaphylaxis  and  in  an  environment 
where full resuscitation service is immediately available. 
Patients  treated  with  Perjeta  must  have  HER2-positive  tumour  status,  defined  as  a  score  of  3+  by 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  and/or  a  ratio  of  ≥2.0  by  in  situ  hybridisation  (ISH)  assessed  by  a 
validated test. 
To ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, 
which can ensure  validation of the testing procedures. For full instructions on assay performance and 
interpretation please refer to the package leaflets of validated HER2 testing assays. 
The  recommended  initial  loading  dose  of  Perjeta  is 840  mg  administered  as  a  60  minute  intravenous 
infusion,  followed  every  3  weeks  thereafter  by  a  maintenance  dose  of  420  mg  administered  over  a 
period of 30 to 60 minutes. 
When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial loading dose of trastuzumab is 8 mg/kg body 
weight  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  followed  every  3  weeks  thereafter  by  a  maintenance 
dose of 6 mg/kg body weight.  
When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2, administered 
thereafter  on  a  3  weekly  schedule.  The  dose  of  docetaxel  may  be  escalated  to  100 mg/m2  on 
subsequent cycles if the initial dose is well tolerated.  
The medicinal products should be administered sequentially. Perjeta and trastuzumab can be given in 
any  order.  When  the  patient  is  receiving  docetaxel,  this  should  be  administered  after  Perjeta  and 
trastuzumab.  An  observation  period  of  30  to  60  minutes  is  recommended  after  each  Perjeta  infusion 
and before commencement of any subsequent infusion of trastuzumab or docetaxel. 
Patients should be treated with Perjeta until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pertuzumab  is  a  full-length  recombinant  humanised  IgG1(κ)  monoclonal  antibody  containing  an  N-
linked oligosaccharide.  
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 13/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pertuzumab is targeted against sub-domain II of the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth 
factor  2  (HER2),  blocking heterodimerisation  of  HER2  with  other  members of the  receptor  family  and 
resultant  ligand  activated  signalling.  HER2  is  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  with  intrinsic  tyrosine 
kinase activity. It is one of four members of the human EGFR family which also includes EGFR (HER1), 
HER3  and  HER4.  HER  signalling  is  known  to  play  roles  in  neoplastic  cell  growth,  malignant 
transformation and resistance to chemotherapy. In addition, pertuzumab activates antibody-dependent 
cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), as does trastuzumab. In contrast, trastuzumab binds to sub-domain IV of the 
extracellular  domain  of  HER2  and  disrupts  ligand  independent  interactions,  but  is  not  effective  in 
blocking dimerisation of HER2 with ligand activated family members EGFR, HER3 or HER4. In addition, 
trastuzumab, by binding to domain IV, blocks a proteolytic cleavage site on the HER2 ectodomain and 
the  resulting  generation  of  phosphorylated  p95  and  constitutive  activation  of  the  intracellular  kinase 
domains. Pertuzumab does not share this activity with trastuzumab. 
The  Applicant  has  applied  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  principles  to  develop  the  process  and  product 
controls for the commercial manufacture of Perjeta.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Genentech  Inc.,  1000  New  Horizons  Way,  Vacaville,  CA 
95688-9431, USA. This site is also responsible for batch release testing of the active substance. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  based  on  a  platform  approach  applied  in  relation  to  other  centrally 
authorised Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-derived monoclonal antibody products manufactured by the 
Applicant. 
The plasmid containing the heavy and light chains was transfected into CHO cells and a pre-bank was 
established. 
Cell banking system 
A  two-tiered  cell  banking  system  of  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB)  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  was 
developed  and  maintained  in  accordance  to  current  Good  Manufacturing  Practices  (cGMP)  and  ICH 
guidelines.  
Procedures  followed  for  the  preparation  of  the  MCB  and  WCB  were  described.  An  extensive  range  of 
tests  was  performed  for  their  characterisation,  in  accordance  to  ICH  guidelines,  including  identity, 
viability, stability, presence of adventitious agents. 
Cell culture process  
Pertuzumab is produced in a fed-batch process using a suspension-adapted CHO cell line. The source 
of cell is typically the WCB but can also be the MCB. 
The cell culture process involves three stages: 
- The seed train,  
- The inoculum train, 
- The production stage. 
Following the production phase, the cell culture fluid containing pertuzumab is separated from the cells 
by centrifugation and filtered. The resulting cell culture filtrate is then further purified (see below). 
Cell  culture  conditions  and  in-process  controls  (IPC)  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  are 
considered appropriate. 
Purification process  
The  purification  process  consists  of  a  series  of  chromatography,  viral  inactivation  and  filtration  and 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps. 
Each  step  of  the  purification  process  has  been  adequately  described,  including  description  of  the 
different buffers used, column regeneration and storage conditions of both columns and product after 
each step. Suitable IPC controls are in place, with acceptable limits.  
Process validation

Development,  characterisation,  and  validation  of  the  pertuzumab  process  is  built  upon  a 
comprehensive  science-  and  risk-based  approach,  which 
incorporates  process  and  product 
understanding developed from pertuzumab-specific studies as well as platform knowledge gained from 
similar molecules and processes.  
Manufacturing process development 
Changes to the manufacturing process have occurred three times during development.  
Characterisation 
A) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
A1) Physicochemical characterisation: 
The  molecular  weight  was  determined  by  electrospray  ionisation  mass  spectrometry  (ESI-MS).  The 
mass  for  deglycosylated  non-reduced  pertuzumab  is  approximately  145.2  kDa.  Tryptic  peptide 
mapping confirmed the primary structure.  
Tryptic  digestion  of  non-reduced  vs  reduced  reference  standard  followed  by  reversed  phase  liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was used to identify disulfide bond sites.  
The  N-linked  glycosylation  site  of  pertuzumab  was  confirmed  by  tryptic  peptide  mapping.  The 
quantitative glycosylation profile for this site was also determined.  
Glycation of lysine residues was assessed. Sites of glycation were identified. 
Hydrophobic  interaction  chromatography  analysis  of  carboxypeptidase  B  and  papain  digested  active 
substance was used to assess oxidation. 
Deamidation has been examined on stressed material.  
Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) was performed to analyse the size 
distribution of the pertuzumab molecule. The detected peaks correspond to the monomer peak (main 
peak)  and  high-molecular  weight  species  (HMWS)  and  low-molecular-weight  species  (LMWS)  of  the 
pertuzumab molecule.  
SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing and reducing conditions.  
A2) Biological characterisation: 
- Functional Fab-related assays 
Binding of pertuzumab to HER2 was demonstrated by a HER2 ELISA. 
An anti-proliferation assay is used as potency assay for characterisation and control of pertuzumab. It 
is based on the ability of pertuzumab to bind and inhibit the proliferation of a HER2-expressing breast 
cancer cell line. 
- Functional Fc-related assays 
As pertuzumab is an IgG1, it was also characterised for effector functions: 
Since  pertuzumab  was  shown  to  be  capable  in  vitro  (ELISA)  of  binding  C1q,  complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) was evaluated.  
Binding of pertuzumab to soluble human FcγRI, FcγRIIa R131, FcγRIIa H131, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa V158, 
FcγRIIIa F158 was assessed. 
The ability of pertuzumab to induce ADCC (Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) in vitro was 
confirmed using three target HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines and two effector cell lines. 
The impact of glycosylation on biological activity of pertuzumab was assessed. 
- Apoptosis assay 
Apoptosis was evaluated by assessing caspase-3 and -7 activity using three HER2-expressing cell lines. 
B) Variants and impurities

The impurity profile of pertuzumab active substance was determined by a thorough physicochemical 
and biological characterisation in combination with comprehensive process validation studies that 
demonstrated the removal of process-related impurities. 
Product-related substances conform to the peaks observed in the applied methods for size distribution, 
presence of fragments, dimers and higher aggregates and charge properties of pertuzumab in the 
dissolved state.  
Potential process-related impurities include: 
- Cell substrate derived impurities: host cell proteins (HCP) and DNA; 
- Cell culture derived impurities; 
- Downstream-derived impurities such as leached Protein A; 
- Other impurities including endotoxin, bioburden. 
Specification 
The active substance release specifications have been suitably justified and are supported by 
consistent data from multiple lots. The specifications contain test for pharmacopoeial methods as well 
as specific methods to ensure sufficient safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, quantity, 
potency. 
Stability 
The design of the stability program, including the testing intervals and temperature storage conditions, 
are  in  accordance  to  current  guidelines.  The  tests  chosen  are  a  subset  of  tests  from  the  release 
specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.  
The  stability  data  provided  were  within  the  specifications  and  support  a  shelf  life  for  the  active 
substance of 36 months when stored at less than -20°C.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Pertuzumab  finished  product  is  provided  as  a  clear  to  slightly  opalescent,  colourless  to  pale  brown, 
sterile  liquid  solution  and  contains  no  preservatives.  Each  single-use  20  mL  vial  contains  420  mg 
pertuzumab  for  intravenous  infusion.  The  finished  product  is  formulated  as  30  mg/mL  pertuzumab  in 
L-histidine, sucrose and polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. These excipients are commonly used in formulating 
protein pharmaceuticals. 
Two formulations were used over the course of product development. 
Adventitious agents 
No  animal-derived  raw  materials  are  used  directly  in  the  pertuzumab  manufacturing  process.  Fetal 
bovine  serum,  porcine  trypsin  and  bovine  apotransferrin  were  used  in  early  development  of  the 
parental  CHO  cell  line.  Animal-derived  materials  are  used  to  generate  raw  materials  for  pertuzumab 
manufacture. However, based on their derivation, processing and sourcing, they are not considered to 
be a risk with respect to TSE. 
All cell banks and end-of-production cells were shown to be free of detectable microbial contaminants 
besides the presence of retrovirus-like particles in the cell line. These particles are non-infectious and 
typical of a CHO cell line. The viral testing of the cell banks is in line with the relevant guidelines. 
Viral  removal  capacity  by  the  pertuzumab  purification  process  was  evaluated  for  X-MuLV,  MMV  and 
SV40, which is the standard panel of model viruses from the Applicant for a rodent cell line. Historical 
platform  knowledge  related  to  viral  inactivation  and  removal  was  considered  by  the  Applicant  in  the 
demonstration of viral safety.

Manufacture of the product 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  starts  with  the  thawing  of  the  active  substance.  Multiple 
bulks  may  be  pooled  in  a  steam-sterilised  stainless  steel  mixing  vessel  and  then  filtered.  A  second 
sterile filtration is performed in-line within a closed system directly into the filler. The finished product 
solution is filled into sterilised, depyrogenated Type  I borosilicate glass vials.  The filled vials are then 
stoppered, capped and crimped with an aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. Following vial 
inspection, the final product is labelled and packaged. The finished product is stored at 2°C–8°C. 
Product specification 
Appropriate  specifications  have  been  developed.  The  specifications  contain  tests  for  pharmacopoeial 
methods as well as specific methods. 
Stability of the product 
Real-time  and  accelerated  stability  studies  were  initiated  in  accordance  to  ICH  guidelines  and  per 
protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. On the basis of the 
data provided, the approvable shelf life for the finished product is 36 months at 2-8°C. 
2.2.4.  Overview of the Quality by Design approach 
The standard elements in Modules 2 and 3 supporting a recombinant antibody filing are present in the 
pertuzumab dossier. In addition, the use of risk assessments and decision tools is described, providing 
transparency  into  the  definition  of  Critical  Quality  Attributes  (CQAs),  Critical  Process  Parameters 
(CPPs),  acceptable  process  parameter  ranges,  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  control 
systems  and  process  monitoring.  These  tools  have  been  developed  as  part  of  an  integrated  risk 
management system building on concepts expressed in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10, and key decision criteria 
were calibrated using information from the Applicant's approved products. This systematic approach to 
risk assessment is based on an understanding of the connections between the product quality and the 
manufacturing  process  and  rests  strongly  on  platform  knowledge  for  recombinant  antibody  products 
manufactured by the Applicant.  
The  decision-making  framework  for  identification  of  pertuzumab  CQAs  and  CPPs,  as  well  as  the 
development of an overall control strategy, are depicted in Figure 1.

Quality Target Product Profile 
Pertuzumab  is  an  IgG1  antibody  made  in  a  manner  typical  of  the  Applicant's  platform  monoclonal 
antibody  process,  using  IgG1  frameworks,  cell  culture  production  host  cells,  process  conditions, 
operational  strategies,  and  the  number  and  sequence  of  downstream  unit  operations  similar  to those 
used  for  several  of  the  Applicant's  licensed  antibodies.  Knowledge  derived  from  this  process  and 
product  platform  experience,  along  with  other  relevant  process  development  knowledge,  pertuzumab 
product  understanding  (product  characterisation  based  on  prior  knowledge),  and  relevant  scientific 
literature, informed the Risk Ranking and Filtering (RRF) assessments that guided the identification of 
a Quality Target Product Profile (QTTP) and CQAs and the design of process characterisation studies. 
Quality Attributes 
Quality  attributes  are  divided  into  the  following  assessment  categories:  product  variants,  process-
related  impurities,  composition  and  strength,  adventitious  agents,  other  obligatory  CQAs  and  raw 
materials and leachables (Table 1).

Table 1 – Categories of Product Quality Attributes for Pertuzumab 
Product variants 
Criticality of product variants and process-related impurities was assessed using an RRF approach and 
acceptance criteria were established for CQAs as applicable. The CQA RRF approach involved assigning 
both impact (Table 2) and uncertainty (Table 3) scores to each quality attribute. Impact Scores were 
assigned  based  on  the  magnitude  or  severity  of  the  effect  on  four  components:  bioactivity, 
pharmacokinetics  (PK),  immunogenicity,  and  safety.  Uncertainty  scores  were  based  on  the  level  of 
knowledge  of  the  particular  quality  attribute.  Product  variants  were  assessed  on  a  product-specific 
basis  to  account  for  the  unique  modifications,  mechanism  of  action,  route  of  administration,  non 
clinical  and  clinical  experience,  in  vitro  studies  and  other  factors  that  influence  potential  risk  to 
patients. Prior knowledge was applied as applicable, in part to assess risk for process-related impurities 
in products manufactured using this same platform process.

with uncertainty (Table 4).

Note:  Light  green  indicates  low-risk  attributes  (non-CQAs);  light  red  indicates  high-risk  attributes  (CQAs).  Boxes 
blacked  out  indicate  Impact  and  Uncertainty  combinations  that  are  disallowed  because  Very  High  Uncertainty 
attributes are assigned a default impact of 17. 
a Uncertainty scales are defined in Table 18. 
b Risk scales are defined in Table 17. 
c The combination of Uncertainty of 1 and Impact of 12 is categorised as CQA. 
Obligatory CQA 
Regulatory  requirements  specify  that  certain  attributes  in  the  composition/strength  and  adventitious 
agent  categories  must  always  be  controlled.  Therefore,  these  attributes  were  classified  as  obligatory 
CQAs  and  were  not  subject  to  further  evaluation.  For  these  attributes,  appropriate  process  and 
analytical controls were implemented.  
Raw materials 
Raw materials were evaluated for potential toxicity by considering an Estimated Daily Intake, assuming 
no clearance in the process or with clearance, compared to the Acceptable Daily Intake (Figure 2). This 
approach  was  taken  as  a  means  to  evaluate  and  express  theoretical  risk  to  patients  related  to  the 
presence of these materials. In practice, these materials are consistently removed by the process. In 
many cases, raw materials are common to the Applicant's platform CHO antibody process.

Figure 2 – Approach to Assessing Risk Associated with Pertuzumab Raw Materials 
Leachables 
The  approach  for  identification  of  specific  leachable  as  CQAs  is  dependent  on  whether  a  specific 
compound can be detected. If a specific leachable is shown to exceed acceptable and safe levels, that 
compound may be designated as a CQA. 
Establishing Acceptance Criteria for CQAs (CQA-AC) 
CQA-ACs  are  generally  based  on  information  that  links  quality  attribute  to  product  safety  and/or 
efficacy.  These  acceptance  criteria  are  used  to  design  cell  culture,  purification,  and  finished  product 
process  characterisation  studies  to  identify  CPPs.  Degradation  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product during processing and storage is considered in order to ensure consistent delivery of product 
that conforms to specifications throughout its shelf life. 
The general approach to setting acceptance criteria for CQAs is shown in Table 5.  
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 22/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 5 – Approach to Setting Acceptance Criteria for Pertuzumab CQAs 
For attributes of high criticality due to safety or immunogenicity concerns, CQA-ACs are based closely 
on  product-specific  clinical  experience,  augmented  by  applicable  knowledge  gained  from  similar 
products and processes. 
For  attributes  critical  because  of  potential  impacts  on  potency  or  PK,  data  collected  from  clinical  and 
non-clinical experience with pertuzumab as well as similar products were considered when appropriate 
to justify wider acceptance criteria. The cumulative impact of attributes on potency or PK is not allowed 
to exceed ± 20% (potency) or –20% to + 25% (PK). Specific acceptance criteria for attributes related 
to  potency  and  PK  are  ultimately  set  considering  process  performance  data,  with  the  objective  of 
ensuring robust parametric control of each attribute, minimising the need to test directly during Quality 
batch  release  or  stability  testing.  A  proportionality  factor  was  applied  that  takes  into  account  the 
relative potency of the attribute determined from an in vitro biological assay or the relative area under 
the curve for a particular attribute determined from PK studies compared to the control. 
Process characterisation and validation 
The  complete  process  characterisation  and  validation  project  includes  studies  conducted  using  a 
combination  of  scale-down  models  and 
full-scale  equipment.  Site-  and  scale-independent 
characterisation  studies  to  support  identification  of  CPPs  were  conducted  using  scale-down  models  of 
the  manufacturing-scale  unit  operations.  These  studies  were  designed  by  integrating  process 
understanding  developed during  process  and  product  development,  platform knowledge  and  scientific 
and engineering principles. 
•  Scale-down model qualification 
The pertuzumab scale-down model was qualified based primarily on the comparison of small scale and 
manufacturing scale averages for each KPI (Key Performance Indicator), non-CQA and CQA relevant to 
the unit operation.  
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 23/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Risk assessment of each unit operation 
After identification of pertuzumab CQAs, and following collection of sufficient process knowledge during 
early development, a risk assessment of each unit operation in the pertuzumab manufacturing process 
(RRF) was performed to identify parameters that may potentially have critical impact to the quality of 
pertuzumab  (CQAs)  or  to  process  performance  through  impact  to  KPIs.  By  this  process,  parameters 
are  ranked  based  on  the  estimated  severity  of  the  parameter’s  direct  effect  on  a  product  quality 
attribute  or  KPI,  or  its  potential  effect  through  interactions  with  other  parameters.  The  rankings  for 
impact to CQAs are scaled more steeply than for non-CQAs and for KPIs (Table 6). 
The parameters considered for each unit operation were based on the function and operating principles 
of the unit operation and required outputs (for example cell mass generation, product generation, host 
cell  impurity  clearance,  aggregate  removal,  etc).  The  output  of  the  RRF  procedure  is  a 
recommendation on the minimum level of complexity with which parameters should be characterised. 
Table  6  –  Impact  Description  and  Corresponding  Ranking  for  Pertuzumab  Process 
Characterisation/Process Validation RRF 
Definitions for the relative impact descriptions are provided in Table 7. 
Table 7 – Impact Descriptions and Definitions for Pertuzumab Process 
Characterisation/Process Validation RRF 
Note: Effect is considered for variation of parameter across a proposed characterisation range. 
Main  effect  and  interaction  effect  impact  ranks  are  multiplied  to  generate  an  overall  Severity  Score. 
The  minimum  level  of  experimental  complexity  for  characterising  the  parameter  is  determined  based 
on the Severity Score as summarised in Table 8.

Three  potential  experimental  design  strategies  are  available  for  characterising  a  parameter:  inclusion 
in a multivariate study, in an univariate study, or no further study needed (Table 9). The highest score 
assigned to a process parameter between impact to CQA, non-CQA and KPI is used to determine how 
this process parameter should be characterised. 
Table  9  –  Experimental  Design  Strategies  Based  on  Severity  Score  for  Pertuzumab  Process 
Characterisation 
•  Univariate and multivariate studies 
The  Process  Characterisation/Process  Validation  RRF  outcomes  provide  a  systematic  recommendation 
for  the  design  of  univariate  studies  and  for  multivariate  Design  of  Experiments  (DoE)  required  to 
characterise  product  variability  in  response  to  variation  in  process  conditions.  These  studies  provide 
the basis for identification of CPPs. These studies also allow identification of worst-case conditions for 
CPPs  for  each  unit  operation,  enabling  the  performance  of  worst-case  linkage  studies  that  challenge 
overall process robustness.  
To provide an additional degree of assurance that the manufacturing process will deliver product that 
consistently  meets  CQA-ACs,  the  results  of  process  characterisation  studies  are  compared  to  a  more 
conservative  CQA  target  range  (CQA-TR).  The  CQA-TR  is  derived  by  narrowing  the  CQA-AC  and  is 
intended to account for some of the uncertainties associated with the use of scale-down systems and 
statistical modeling. 
Two different types of acceptable ranges are defined for a process parameter: proven acceptable range 
(PAR) and multivariate acceptable range (MAR). As defined in ICH Q8, a PAR is the characterised range 
of  a  process  parameter  for  which  operation  within  this  range,  while  keeping  other  parameters  at 
target,  will  result  in  a  product  meeting  relevant  quality  criteria.  PARs  can  be  used  to  resolve 
manufacturing  deviations  (single-parameter  excursions).  A  MAR  is  defined  by  the  Applicant  as  the 
range of a parameter that results in acceptable product quality when all parameters tested are varied 
across  their  acceptable  ranges.  PARs  are  usually  wider  than  MARs  for  the  same  parameter  (as 
illustrated in Figure 3) and may be established from univariate experiments, but may also be derived 
from  multivariate  data  where  this  is  most  efficient.  MARs  are  typically  established  from  multivariate 
experiments, but may be derived from univariate data where it is known that the parameter does not 
interact with other parameters. MARs and PARs are established for all process parameters included in 
process characterisation and validation studies, whether or not they are eventually classified as critical. 
It  is  expected  that  an  excursion  of  a  process  parameter  from  its  MAR  will  result  in  an  investigation. 
PARs will be used only to evaluate the impact of a deviation from the MAR.

Identification of CPPs 
Impact Ratio 
A  parameter  is  identified  by  the  Applicant  as  a  CPP  when  its  variation  has  a  practically  significant 
impact on a CQA. Practical significance is expressed as a quantitative metric, the Impact Ratio: 
The process mean term represents the mean CQA response when the process is operated at target and 
the MAR result is the expected value of the CQA response when the parameter is set to its MAR limit. 
The  Impact  Ratio  numerator  is  the  effect  on  a  CQA  due  to  moving  the  process  parameter  from  its 
target  value  to  its  MAR  limit.  It  is  derived  from  the  Estimate  (β)  of  a  linear  regression  analysis.  The 
denominator is the absolute difference between the mean CQA response and the closest CQA-TR limit, 
when the process is run under target conditions. Conceptually, the numerator represents how much a 
CQA  may  vary  when  a  process  parameter  is  moved  to  the  edge  of  its  MAR,  while  the  denominator 
represents  how  much  CQA  variability  is  allowed  before  the  CQA  approaches  its  CQA-TR.  A  graphical 
representation of this concept is shown Figure 4. 
Figure  4  –  Graphical  Conceptualisation  of  Impact  Ratio  Terms  for  Pertuzumab  CPP 
Identification 
Impact Ratios are also calculated for interactions, where the quantity in the numerator represents the 
additional variation in a CQA response due to operation of two process parameters at the limit of their 
MARs beyond the variation due to each process parameter individually. 
CQA-TRs are calculated for the final step of a process, either bulk active substance or finished product. 
CQA-TRs are translated to upstream steps to assess outcomes of studies on those unit operations. In 
some  cases  a  CQA-TR  cannot  be  translated  upstream,  for  example  when  a  high  degree  of  change 
occurs  across  the  process,  and  a  CQA-TR  cannot  be  determined  for  CQA  results  in  those  unit 
operations. This is the case for some impurities that have substantial clearance across the purification 
steps  (e.g.  HCP  in  upstream  pools  due  to  significance  clearance  during  further  purification).  When  a 
CQA-TR cannot be defined, the allowable variation is expressed as a function of the process mean, i.e. 
a  degree  of  variation  away  from  the  process  mean,  as  defined  by  the  impact  ratio  threshold.  This  is 
also applicable to the impact ratio calculation of quality attributes which are not CQAs. 
A scale offset was applied or not to take into account an observed difference in means between results 
from  manufacturing  scale  and  small  scale  for  a  given  process  attribute.  It  was  applied  as  needed  for 
outputs  classified  as  “Not  Equivalent”  or  “Probable  Non-Equivalence”  in  order  to  provide  a  more 
predictive scale-down model for interpreting process characterisation and worst-case linkage results:

Based on process characterisation study results for individual unit operations, an initial assessment is 
performed  using  the  Impact  Ratio  to  classify  parameters  as  high-impact,  low-impact,  or  non-impact 
with the following criteria:  
Impact Ratio > 0.33: high-impact 
• 
•  0.33 ≥ Impact Ratio ≥ 0.10: low-impact 
•  0.10 > Impact Ratio: non-impact 
Selection of the cut-off values of 0.33 and 0.10 are based on likelihood of multiple process parameters 
simultaneously operating at their worst-case conditions. 
Worst case linkage studies 
Linkage studies spanning the manufacturing process are performed. For each CQA, the study includes 
at  minimum,  worst-case  conditions  for  all  parameters  meeting  the  criteria  for  high-  and  low-impact. 
Based  on  the  results  of  this  study,  parameters  initially  categorised  as  low  impact  either  remain  low-
impact  based  on  the  acceptable  outcome  of  the  linkage  study  (i.e. the  CQA  result  is  within  the 
CQA-TR), or they are reclassified as high-impact CPPs. Parameters initially categorised as high impact 
remain  identified  as  high-impact  regardless  of  linkage  study  results.  For  pertuzumab,  there  were  no 
linkage studies that resulted in CQA results outside the CQA-TRs. 
Designation of CPP/non-CPP 
The  cumulative  data  collected  during  process  characterisation  and  validation  were  considered  in 
identifying CPPs. Process parameters are ultimately categorised by the Applicant as high-impact CPPs, 
low-impact CPPs, or non-CPPs by a decision tree (Figure 5). 
Figure 5 – Overall Decision Tree for Pertuzumab CPP Identification 
Control strategy 
The pertuzumab overall control strategy comprises: 
•  Raw material control 
•  Robust process control via procedural and process parameter control 
• 
• 
• 
In-process, batch release, and stability testing 
Testing done as part of process monitoring 
Testing to demonstrate comparability. 
These measures assure all pertuzumab CQAs remain within acceptable ranges. 
RRF assessment for Attribute Testing Strategy 
The RRF tool for determining the Attribute Testing Strategy (ATS RRF) is shown in Figure 6. The tool 
multiplies  the  score  for  impact  of  a  quality  attribute  (Table  2)  with  a  score  representing  either  the 
impact  from  the  manufacturing  process  (Figure  7)  or  the  attribute  stability  during  storage  of  active 
substance and finished product (Figure 8). 
In addition to determining the testing strategy for the product and process-related variants by this tool, 
the assessment was also performed for attributes considered to be obligatory due to statutory testing 
Perjeta

requirements and for formulation components. For obligatory CQAs such as protein concentration, the 
CQA Impact Score is assigned as 20 for the purposes of this assessment. 
The  evaluation  is  performed  identically  for  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturing 
processes. 
Figure 6 – Attribute Testing Strategy Ranking Filter (ATS RRF) 
The  Process  Impact  score  represents  an  estimation  of  the  residual  risk  that  a  CQA  could  exceed  its 
CQA-TR when the process is operated within the acceptable ranges (Figure 7).  
Figure 7 – Decision Tree for Assigning the Process Impact Score 
The Stability Impact score represents the residual risk that an attribute will exceed its CQA-AC during 
active  substance  and  finished  product  storage  at  the  recommended  conditions.  It  is  used  in 
combination with the CQA Impact score to generate an ATS score for the active substance and finished 
product  that  assesses  whether  or  not  testing  of  an  attribute  should  be  performed  as  part  of  the 
stability program (Figure 8).

Figure 8 – Decision Tree for Assigning the Stability Impact Score 
Three outcomes of the ATS RRF assessment are possible: 
•  Control System testing is required (in-process, batch release, and/or stability testing) 
• 
Testing is required as part of process monitoring or to support comparability: attributes in this 
category  are  tested  as  part  of  process  monitoring  under  a  process  validation  protocol  and/or 
evaluated during change assessments. 
•  No testing is required. 
Testing Strategy Robustness 
The final testing strategy for each attribute was assessed for its robustness using the Attribute Testing 
Strategy  Robustness  (ATSR)  RRF  tool  to  determine  the  risk  to  the  overall  program  that  a  quality 
attribute  is  missed  by  the  defined  control  strategy  (Figure  9,  Tables  10  and  11).  The  type  of 
measurement  (i.e. direct versus  indirect  measurement)  as  well  as  its  sensitivity  and  robustness  were 
considered.  For  the  proposed  pertuzumab  control  strategies  for  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product, each CQA was judged to be adequately controlled.

Quality Attributes

Table 11 – ATSR Scoring Matrix 
Regardless  of  whether  the  attribute  is  tested  through  the  Applicant's  in-process,  batch  release  or 
stability  testing,  or  is  monitored  as  a  part  of  ongoing  process  monitoring,  the  management  of  the 
attribute  during  the  post-approval  lifecycle  of  the  commercial  pertuzumab  process  is  defined  in  a 
process monitoring protocol required by the Applicant’s Pharmaceutical Quality System. 
Comparability testing 
Testing  to  support  comparability  assessments  includes  tests  that  are  performed  as  part  of  batch 
release, stability and in-process testing as well as additional testing of selected attributes. For stability 
studies  performed  as  part  of  comparability  exercises,  the  assays  selected  will  include  those  assays 
performed  as  part  of  the  normal  stability  program  as  well  as  additional  assays  to  measure  selected 
attributes, if appropriate. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
A) Aspects related to Quality by Design 
Consistent manufacture of a medicinal product of acceptable quality was demonstrated. The thorough 
work  to  develop  a  manufacturing  process  by  use  of  QbD  concepts  was  acknowledged.  Whilst  Major 
Objections were raised during the evaluation, some QbD principles and elements, for example the use 
of  platform  knowledge,  the  extension  of  CQA-AC  beyond  clinical  experience,  the  use  of  Risk  Ranking 
and  Filtering  (RRF) tool  to  assign  criticality  to quality  attributes,  were  endorsed  and  the  Major 
Objections were appropriately addressed by the Applicant.  
Quality Attribute Criticality 
Pertuzumab variants and process-related impurities were thoroughly characterised. 
The  principle  of  applying  a  RRF  tool,  based  on  impact  to  biological  activity,  pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity  and  safety  and  on  the  uncertainty  of  that  impact,  in  order  to  define  quality  attribute 
criticality was endorsed. A conservative approach was taken for CQA designation.

ADCC in the mode of action of pertuzumab was unclear but could not be totally dismissed according to 
the  data  presented  (characterisation  and  non  clinical).  Assessment  of  the  fucosylation  pattern,  which 
can impact ADCC activity, was initially not taken into consideration as part of the control strategy. This 
was considered as a Major Objection. 
In their response, the Applicant provided a justification to support their view that ADCC activity does 
not  add  to  the  efficacy  of  pertuzumab.  However,  the  Applicant  acknowledged  that  residual  risk  from 
ADCC impacting variants cannot be totally excluded. 
The  Applicant  evaluated  various  attributes  in  relation  to  a  possible  increased  or  decreased  impact  on 
ADCC.  Studies  clearly  demonstrated  that  afucosylation  increases  in  vitro  ADCC  and  the  predominant 
afucosylated  form,  G0-F,  gives  a  strong  correlation  with  ADCC.  G0-F  was  added  to  the  list  of  CQAs. 
The  Attribute  Testing  Strategy  (ATS)  RRF  tool  was  applied  to  G0-F  to  determine  the  suitable  testing 
strategy  and  it  was  concluded  that  this  attribute  needs  to  be  tested  as  part  of  the  active  substance 
Control  System  testing.  Currently,  and  until  the  method  is  finally  validated,  the  test  is  part  of  the 
process validation protocol. The Applicant will have to apply for a variation to add %G0-F to the active 
substance release specifications.  
The  CQA-ACs  and  specifications  initially  proposed  by  the  Applicant  for  selected  attributes,  taking  into 
consideration the experience with other monoclonal antibody products licensed by the Applicant, were 
not considered acceptable. In their Day 180 responses, the Applicant tightened the proposed limits to 
be more in line with levels found in clinical batches. The revised limits were considered acceptable. 
The principle applied for the assessment of raw materials in relation to Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) 
and removal was acknowledged. Impact of raw material variability on the process was also discussed. 
The  Applicant  claimed  both  product-specific  and  platform  knowledge  with  regard  to  raw  material 
variability.  The  Applicant  considered  that  variability  of  raw  materials  discussed  and  its  impact  on  the 
process  are  not  significant  and  that  the  current  raw  material  specifications  provide  sufficient  control. 
The justification and supportive data provided were considered acceptable.  
There  was  also  discussion  on  the  setting  of  the  CQA  Target  Range  (CQA-TR)  from  the  corresponding 
CQA-AC and discussion on the setting of CQA-ACs for certain CQAs. 
Design Space 
A  “process-wide”  Design  Space  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  was  initially  applied 
including unit operations, process parameters with their associated Multivariate Acceptable Ranges that 
define the limits of the Design Space and raw materials.  
The principles used to define the proposed Design Space were endorsed. However, there were several 
issues which, taken together, led to a Major Objection at Day 120 and Day 180 of the procedure that 
precluded the approval of the Design Space. 
As a consequence, the claimed Design Space was withdrawn. CHMP acknowledged the efforts made by 
the  Applicant  on  the  development  of  a  Design  Space.  There  is  the  possibility  to  reapply  for  a  Design 
Space post-approval. 
Process Parameter Criticality 
The  strategy  to  conduct  a  risk  assessment  of  each  unit  operation  in  order  to  estimate  the  impact  of 
process  parameters  on  CQAs,  non-CQAs  and  KPIs,  with  the  subsequent  determination  of  a  severity 
score to determine the conduct of univariate and multivariate studies, was endorsed.  
It  was  acknowledged  that  the  concept  of  Impact  Ratio  is  an  objective  measure  of  process  parameter 
criticality. However, a Major Objection was raised. It was considered that the calculation of this Impact 
Ratio could be affected by potential sources of bias related to: 
- The adequacy of the statistical multivariate models which could then affect the effect estimates; 
- The offset introduction which could lead to inaccurate predictions for scale differences. 
Justification  was  provided  for  the  different  possible  calculations  of  an  Impact  Ratio  and  the  choice  of 
the cut-off values of 0.10 and 0.33.  
Following narrowing of the CQA-AC for selected attributes at Day 180, with consequential narrowing of 
the respective CQA-TR, the process characterisation was reviewed and validation data associated with 
these  CQAs  and  determined  that  for  use  in  a  traditional  process  description  without  a  Design  Space 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 31/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
claim, no further narrowing of the process parameter ranges is required and no additional parameters 
were elevated to CPPs.  
Post-Approval Lifecycle Management (PALM) plan 
A PALM plan was initially proposed to describe how the Applicant would: 
-  Perform  real-time  and/or  retrospective  monitoring  of  process  and  product  attributes  (CPP  and  KPI 
excursions, quality attributes in the Control System testing and those classified as CaM attributes); 
- Manage changes in attribute criticality; 
- Manage changes to CPPs and non-CPPs; 
- Update the Control System as necessary based on additional process and product knowledge gained; 
- Manage the PALM plan in the Pharmaceutical Quality System. 
The  principle  of  implementing  such  a  PALM  plan  was  fully  endorsed  as  part  of  the  QbD  approach 
developed by the Applicant. Following the withdrawal of the Design Space, the PALM plan was removed 
from the dossier. 
B) Other Quality aspects 
Active substance 
The description of the manufacturing process is satisfactory. 
The cell culture process and purification process were carefully characterised. 
The  few  “other  concerns”  identified  in  relation  to  process  validation/evaluation  were  satisfactorily 
addressed. 
The  characterisation  data  presented  support  the  conclusion  that  pertuzumab  has  the  structure 
expected for a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody expressed in CHO cells. Product variants 
and  process-related  impurities  were  quantified  and  were  consistent  with  those  described  for  several 
other monoclonal antibody products. Biological and immunological characterisation demonstrated that 
pertuzumab  inhibits  cell  proliferation  by  blocking  the  association  of  HER2  with  other  members  of  the 
HER receptor family.  
The analytical methods used to control the active substance were adequately described and validated. 
The  setting  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  specifications  for  potency  by  bioassay  are 
considered acceptable. 
On the basis of the primary stability data on registration batches, the representative stability data on 
Phase  3  batches  and  the  comparability  established between  them,  a  shelf  life  of  36  months  at -20°C 
was considered acceptable. 
Finished product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  was  adequately  described  and  process  validation 
was considered satisfactory.  
Data to support pharmaceutical development of pertuzumab finished product were satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used to control the finished product were adequately described and validated. 
The release and shelf life specifications for the finished product were adequately justified.  
The  proposed  shelf  life  of  36 months  at  2°C–8°C  for  pertuzumab  finished  product  is  considered 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents safety evaluation 
Data provided to demonstrate adventitious agents safety were considered satisfactory. 
Cell growth issue 
During  the  Q1/Q2  2012  active  substance  manufacturing  campaign,  issues  were  experienced  with  the 
thaw  and  subsequent  propagation  of  cells  from  the  Working  Cell  Bank.  The  Applicant  has  provided 
updates  on  the  issues  and  has  worked  with  Health  Authorities  to  ensure  a  consistent  manufacturing 
process.

2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Overall,  the  quality  of  pertuzumab  is  considered  to  be  in  line  with  the  quality  of  other  approved 
monoclonal  antibodies.  The  different  aspects  of  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The cell culture and purification of the active substance 
are  adequately  described,  controlled  and  validated.  The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  with 
regard  to  its  physicochemical  and  biological  characteristics,  using  state-of  the-art  methods,  and 
appropriate  specifications  are  set.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  has  been 
satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test 
methods and specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including 
TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
The overall Quality of Perjeta is considered acceptable. 
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended a couple of points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development program comprises of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology 
studies. As required, the pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP). Supportive non-GLP studies were claimed to apply to good scientific practice.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Pertuzumab binds to a region of HER2  involved  in  receptor  dimerisation  with  a  binding  affinity  of  0.8 
nM. Pertuzumab sterically interferes with HER2 dimerisation and thus signaling. It was demonstrated in 
vitro  that,  in  contrast  to  trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  is  able  to  inhibit  the  association  of  HER2  with 
EGFR/HER1 and HER3 receptors. Similarly, it was shown in vitro that pertuzumab but not trastuzumab 
inhibited  HER2  signalling  following  HER3  activation.  This  was  evidenced  via  an  absence  of  HER2  and 
HER3 phosphorylation as well the lack of activation of the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways following 
pertuzumab treatment.  
Combination  treatment  of  BT474  breast  cancer  cells  with  trastuzumab  and  pertuzumab  for  24  hours 
caused  a  dose-dependent  downregulation  of  total  and  phosphorylated  HER2  expression  levels  to  a 
greater  extent  than  either  single  agent.  The  combination  of  trastuzumab  and  pertuzumab  reduced 
levels  of  active  phospho-Akt  (PI3K  pathway)  to  a  greater  degree  versus  either  agent  alone.  In 
contrast, signalling from the MAPK cascade was not inhibited. 
In vitro experiments in which HER2-positive human tumour cells KPL-4 and Calu-3 were used as target 
cells  and  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  were  used  as  effector  cells  showed  that 
pertuzumab  activates  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  with  identical  potency  as 
trastuzumab. This is to be expected since pertuzumab and trastuzumab have  identical Fc regions. No 
decrease in potency was observed when both agents were used in combination at the same individual 
concentration  as  applied  during  monotherapy  testing.  While  it  was  found  that  pertuzumab  had  the 
ability  to  bind  complement  C1q,  pertuzumab  treatment  was  not  associated  with  complement-
dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  in  neither  of  the  tested  breast  cancer  cell  lines  (MDA-MB-175-VII  and 
BT474). The lack of CDC activity in vitro was ascribed the presence of complement inhibitory proteins 
in  breast  cancer  tumour  cells  which  protect  these  cells  from  complement-mediated  lysis.  While 
Perjeta

pertuzumab was able to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-175-VII cells which have a low to moderate HER2 
expression it did not induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines with a high HER2 expression (BT474 
cells  and  SKBR3  cells).  Considering  that  pertuzumab  is  indicated  in  patients  with  tumour  expressing 
high levels of HER2, this finding questions to what extent pertuzumab-mediated tumour cell apoptosis 
occurs in the in vivo setting. 
Pertuzumab  inhibited  the  heregulin  (HER3  and  HER4  ligand)  stimulated  growth  of  three  cell  lines 
expressing  low/normal  levels  of  HER2,  namely  the  breast  cancer  cell  lines  MCF7  and  T47D  and  the 
ovarian  cancer  cell  line  Caov3.  Furthermore,  pertuzumab  inhibited  EGF-induced  growth  induction  in 
various  breast  cancer  cell  lines.  While  the  individual  drugs  did  not  alter  cell  survival,  the  1:1 
combination  of  trastuzumab  and  pertuzumab  synergistically  inhibited  the  growth  of  the  HER2 
overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT474.  
Weekly  IV/IP  administrations  of  pertuzumab  demonstrated  anti-tumour  efficacy  in  various  tumour 
xenografts models based on breast cancer, prostate, non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cell lines 
expressing either low or high levels of HER2. Treatment efficacy was monitored using tumour volume. 
Based  on  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic  analysis,  more  than  80%  tumour  growth  inhibition  was 
observed  at  trough  pertuzumab  serum  concentrations  ranging  from  5  to  25  µg/mL.  However,  in  a 
xenograft model based on a trastuzumab-resistant cell line (Founder 2-134R) only around 50% tumour 
growth inhibition was observed at trough pertuzumab serum concentrations of ≥ 50 µg/mL.  
While both pertuzumab and trastuzumab as single agents exhibited anti-tumour activity against HER2 
overexpressing  Calu-3  NSCLC  xenografts  (85%  and  82%  TGI),  the  combination  of  the  two  was 
superior  compared  with  monotherapy,  resulting  in  tumour  regression  and,  in  some  cases,  complete 
remission.  Moreover,  although  not  statistically  significant,  combined  treatment  with  pertuzumab  and 
trastuzumab appeared to result in a higher tumour growth inhibition in the breast cancer cell line MDA-
MB-175 xenograft model than the individual drugs alone. 
The  anti-tumour  activity  of  pertuzumab  (100  mg/kg  IP  once  or  twice  weekly)  was  evaluated  in  nude 
mice  implanted  with  patient-derived  tumours  representing  breast  cancer,  ovarian  cancer  and  NSCLC. 
Pertuzumab exhibited 13-45% tumour growth inhibition in 1 of 6 tested breast tumour, 1 of 4 ovarian 
cancer  tumour  and  4  out  of  18  NSCLC  tumour  xenograft  models.  The  other  tested  xenografts  were 
refractory to pertuzumab single-treatment. The Applicant has clarified that the lack of activity in the in 
patient-derived  breast  tumour  xenografts  could  be  ascribed  to  the  finding  that  the  patient-derived 
tumours were HER2 negative.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  a  study  of  pertuzumab  cross-reactivity  with  normal  human  tissues,  pertuzumab  binding  was 
demonstrated  in  a  membranous  pattern  with  normal  human  tonsil,  parathyroid  gland,  mammary 
gland,  haired  skin,  ureter,  urinary  bladder,  placenta,  and  kidney  tissues.  In  a  Cynomolgus  monkey 
tissue  panel,  pertuzumab  binding  was  demonstrated  in  a  membranous  pattern  with  sweat  and 
sebaceous  glands,  mammary  gland,  placenta,  kidney,  ureter,  urinary  bladder,  and  prostate  gland. 
Overall,  the  immunohistochemical  cross-reactivity  profile  of  pertuzumab  was  in  general  agreement 
with  the  literature  on  the  HER2/neu  expression  and  data  from  the  cross-reactivity  study  conducted 
with trastuzumab. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No  dedicated  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  submitted.  However,  an  evaluation  of  the  risk  for 
effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular system was performed. 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 34/123 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology end points were incorporated into the 7-week IV repeat-dose toxicology study in 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  where  no  effect  on  rectal  body  temperature,  respiration  rate,  blood  pressure, 
heart  rate,  or  electrocardiographic  (ECG)  parameters  were  seen  at  doses  up  to  150  mg/kg/week. 
Moreover,  in  the  26-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  no  ECG,  respiratory  or  blood  pressure  findings 
were made in Cynomolgus monkeys dosed up to 150 mg/kg/week.  
Cardiotoxicity has been reported to occur with trastuzumab when administered alone or in combination 
with  antineoplastic  agents,  particularly  anthracyclines.  Pertuzumab  was  not  associated  with 
cardiotoxicity in the 7- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies since treatment-related findings were 
neither  made  in  the  troponin  T  analysis  nor  in  the  microscopic  examination  on  the  heart.  Despite 
targeting the same HER2 receptor pathway as trastuzumab, pertuzumab appears to add no significant 
cardiac  toxicity  in  the  clinic  when  given  with  trastuzumab.  Regarding  the  potential  for  inducing  CNS 
effects,  no  effects  on  the  general  behaviour  of  the  animals  were  apparent  in  the  7-  and  26-week 
toxicity  studies.  Moreover,  it  is  unlikely  that  pertuzumab  will  enter  the  central  nervous  system  to  a 
significant extent unless the blood-brain barrier is compromised.  
hERG and Purkinje fibre assays were not performed and are not required for biotech products. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The anti-tumour efficacy of pertuzumab was investigated in combination with other anti-cancer agents 
(cisplatin,  gemcitabine,  capecitabine,  erlotinib,  paclitaxel  and  bevacizumab)  in  several  xenograft 
models for non-small cell lung carcinoma, colon carcinoma, mammary tumour, and ovarian carcinoma. 
Generally, combination therapy was superior to the corresponding monotherapies. Responses were in 
some cases dependent on tumour type. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Method of analysis 
A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was validated to quantify pertuzumab in CD1 
mouse,  Nude  mouse,  and  Sprague-Dawley  rat  serum.  A  second  sandwich  ELISA  was  validated  to 
quantify  pertuzumab  in  Cynomolgus  monkey  serum.  The  following  parameters  were  tested  for  both 
assays:  limit  of  detection,  limit  of  quantification,  accuracy  and  linearity,  specificity,  precision, 
robustness, ruggedness, and stability. Because the method in Cynomolgus monkeys was later retired, 
a  third  sandwich  ELISA  was  also  validated  to  quantitate  pertuzumab  in  human  serum,  Cynomolgus 
monkey adult serum, Cynomolgus monkey foetal serum, and Cynomolgus monkey amniotic fluid. 
An  antibody  bridging  ELISA  was  validated  to  detect antibodies  (Anti-therapeutic  antibodies  –  ATA)  to 
pertuzumab  in  Cynomolgus  monkey  serum.  The  following  parameters  were  tested:  cut-point 
determination,  relative  sensitivity,  precision,  cross-reactivity,  interference,  robustness,  ruggedness, 
and stability.   
ELISA  methods  were  validated  and  used  to  support  the  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicity  studies.  The 
methods were validated under non-GLP conditions, however, as they were performed and reported to 
good scientific standard this is acceptable. Overall, the methods of analysis are considered sufficiently 
validated. 
Absorption 
Pertuzumab  serum  exposure  was  evaluated  in  mice  (IV  and  IP),  rats  (IV  and  SC)  and  Cynomolgus 
monkeys  (IV  and  SC).  After  a  single  IV  bolus  dose  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  of  pertuzumab  a  linear 
relationship  between  dose  and  clearance  was  observed.  The  clearance  (CL)  was  4.98,  5.23  and  5.24

ml/day/kg  for  doses  of  15,  50  and  150  mg/kg,  respectively.  Volume  of  distribution  in  central 
compartments  (Vc)  approximated  the  serum  volume,  ranging  from  30.9-37.4  ml/kg.  Mean  values  for 
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) ranged from 68.1-72.7 ml/kg. These volumes did not vary 
with dose. The mean terminal half-life ranged from 9.89-10.4 days.  It is not clear from the applicant’s 
summary, if gender differences exist in PK parameters; however, reviewing the individual parameters 
in the PK reports, it seems that no such gender difference exists.  
After  multiple  IV  dosing  (7  weeks)  in  monkeys  clearance  ranged  from  5.09-7.42  ml/day/kg,  the 
volume  of  distribution  of  central  compartments  ranged  from  35.6-40.5  ml/kg  and  the  mean  terminal 
half-life  ranged  from  8.13-10.6  days.  The  maximum  serum  concentration  (Cmax-obs)  was  estimated 
to  be  approximately  5.7  mg/mL  for  the  150  mg/kg/dose  group.  Following  repeated  IV  dosing,  the 
exposure to pertuzumab appeared to demonstrate a non-linear relationship to dose. This effect may be 
related to the approximately 30% increase in clearance observed when increasing the dose from 50 to 
150  mg/kg/week.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  pertuzumab  is  consistent  with 
trastuzumab  and  other  IgG1  monoclonal  antibodies  that  share  the  same  Fc  region.  This  is  seen  as  a 
distribution phase of less than 1 day, a terminal half-life of app. 10 days and a volume of distribution 
of  the  central  compartment  –  approximating  the  serum  volume  (of  30-50  ml/kg).  Finally,  no  ATAs 
against pertuzumab were  detected after repeat dose administration in monkeys. Based on the popPK 
model (population pharmacokinetic analysis of pertuzumab in cancer patients) developed using all 12 
clinical  studies,  pertuzumab  clearance  (CL)  was  0.239  L/day  (3.4  ml/kg/day)  and  the  central 
compartment  volume  (Vc)  was  3.07  L  (43.86  ml/kg).  The  median  terminal  elimination  half-life  was 
17.2 days (95% CI range: 7.8-32 days). 
The pharmacokinetic studies in mice and rats were performed under non-GLP conditions, however, as 
they were performed and reported to good scientific standard this is acceptable. More importantly the 
toxicokinetic  studies,  used  to  support  the  pivotal  safety  toxicity  studies  in  monkeys,  were  performed 
under GLP conditions. 
Distribution 
Dedicated  studies  investigating  the  distribution  of  pertuzumab  were  not  performed.  Tissue 
concentrations, when using radio labelled proteins, may be difficult to interpret due to the rapid in vivo 
metabolism or unstable radiolabel linkage. Hence, the lack of a tissue distribution study is considered 
acceptable.  
No studies evaluating milk transfer have been performed. It is well-established, that antibodies (IgG) 
are  known  to  be  excreted  in  human  breast  milk,  and  as  such  the  lack  of  a  milk  excretion  study  is 
considered acceptable. Moreover, an adequate warning has been provided in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The  extent  of  placental  transfer  of  pertuzumab  after  IV  administration  to  pregnant  monkeys  was 
investigated.  Both  foetal  and  maternal  exposure  was  confirmed  at  the  time  of  caesarean  section 
(GD100) with pertuzumab serum exposures in foetuses constituting approximately 1/3 of the maternal 
exposure, and thus indicating placental transfer of pertuzumab. The transfer of antibodies from mother 
to foetus occurs primarily in the second and third trimester in humans and in nonhuman primates. In 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  an  exponential  increase  in  IgG  transfer  from  mother  to  foetus  seems  to  start 
around GD84 and by the  time of birth (GD165) antibody levels in the  neonates are similar to that of 
the mothers. Therefore it is expected to see only a fraction (around 25%) of the maternal levels in the 
foetuses around the time of caesarean section (GD100).   
Metabolism 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 36/123 
 
 
 
No  studies  on  metabolism  have  been  performed.  The  expected  consequence  of  pertuzumab 
metabolism is degradation to small peptides and amino acids. Hence, in accordance with ICH S6 (R1) 
guideline, it is acceptable that the metabolism of pertuzumab has not been studied. 
Excretion 
No studies on elimination have been performed. Following degradation of pertuzumab metabolism into 
small peptides and amino acids, the latter may be incorporated into new proteins or excreted renally. 
It is acceptable that no dedicated studies on elimination of pertuzumab have been studied. 
Pharmacokinetics drug interactions 
The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between pertuzumab and bevacizumab (humanized 
monoclonal  antibody  against  VEGF)  were  investigated  in  a  single-dose  pharmacokinetic  study  in  SD 
rats.  No  substantial  differences,  and  therefore  no  PK  interactions,  were  apparent  between  the  PK 
parameters of the rats given a single agent and those of the rats given combination treatment. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
The mean clearance of pertuzumab in serum was higher in tumour-bearing mice than in non tumour-
bearing  mice.  Additionally  the  terminal  half-life  was  considerably  shorter  in  the  tumour-bearing  mice 
than  in  the  non  tumour-bearing  mice.  The  applicant’s  explanation  for  this  difference  in  clearance  is 
pertuzumab binding to HER2 expressed on the human tumour cells and to circulating shed extracellular 
domain or an acute metabolic response caused by the implanted tumour. 
Changes  have  been  introduced  in  the  manufacturing  process  of  pertuzumab  during  development  to 
support  up-scaling  processes  and  a  change  in  cell  line.  Hence,  as  part  of  the  comprehensive 
comparability  strategy,  three  (non-GLP)  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  male  rats  were  designed  and 
performed to show biocomparability of different lots of pertuzumab. Generally the studies showed that 
the different lots of pertuzumab had comparable pharmacokinetic parameters in rats.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A  complete  toxicology  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  guidelines  for 
biologics and anti-cancer products; ICH S6 (R1) guideline, part 1 and 2 and ICH S9. Studies included 
IV  repeat-dose  toxicity  of  up  to  6  month  duration,  embryo-foetal  development  toxicity,  and  other 
toxicity studies. These studies were conducted, except for one (4-week toxicity study in monkeys), in 
compliance with GLP. The intended human route is IV.  
The  Cynomolgus  monkey  was  the  preferred  toxicity  species  based  on  the comparable  in  vitro  human 
and monkey binding affinity and due to lack of binding to the rodent (mouse) ortholog, neu. 
Single dose toxicity 
No  dedicated  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  the  current 
recommendations from EMA (CHMP/SWP/302413/08 and EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  performed,  no  treatment  related  effects  were  seen  on  body 
temperature,  respiration  rates,  blood  pressure,  electrocardiography  and  opthalmoscopy  or  on 
haematology,  urinalysis,  organ  weights,  gross  pathology  or  histopathology.  Moreover  analyses  were 
made  on  antibodies  to  pertuzumab  (ATAs),  troponin  T,  creatinine  kinase,  sperm,  testosterone,  and 
showed  no  treatment  related  effects  either.  Occasionally  decreases  in  food  consumption  and  body 
weight were noted, which was primarily considered secondary to the high incidence of diarrhoea seen

in  the  studies.  In  the  7-week  toxicity  study  two  males  and  two  females/group  where  telemetry 
instrumented in the control and high dose group (150 mg/kg), respectively and no treatment related 
findings  were  seen  on  the  cardiovascular  parameters.  Additionally,  in  the  26-week  study  no  ECG  and 
blood  pressure  findings  were  seen  on  non-instrumented  Cynomolgus  monkeys  dosed  up  to  150 
mg/kg/dose.  
No  clinical  signs  were  seen  in  the  4-weeks  IV  and  subcutaneously  dosed  studies,  whereas  major 
treatment related findings were seen on clinical observations in the 7- and 26-weeks toxicity studies, 
displayed as diarrhoea, liquid and non-formed faeces.  
In  the  7-week  toxicity  study  clinical  observations  revealed  liquid  or  non-formed  faeces  at  a  higher 
incidence and in a dose dependent manner in all dosed groups compared to the control group. Three 
males  and  two  females  in  the  high  dose  were  so  affected  that  they  were  carefully  examined  by 
veterinary  staff  and  had  intensive  supportive  care.  Hence,  the  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be 50 mg/kg. In the treatment free period a partly recovery of the faeces 
consistency was apparent as well as stable body weight and normal food consumption.  
Throughout  the  26-week  toxicity  study  a  higher  incidence  of  liquid,  non-formed  faeces  was  seen  in 
treated monkeys vs. controls (not in a dose dependent manner). The diarrhoea was so severe in one 
female  animal  dosed  50  mg/kg/dose,  that  it  was  euthanized  in  extremis  on  Day  126  of  treatment. 
Three  days  in  advance  the  female  had  been  hunched  and  hypoactive,  had  no  food  consumption,  and 
exhibited diarrhoea. In addition to this, a significantly low body temperature was measured (34.6ºC). 
In two other monkeys (one male dosed 15 mg/kg/dose and one female dosed 150 mg/kg/dose) similar 
adverse  findings  were  seen  during  the  study,  displayed  as  hunched  posture,  lethargy,  weight  loss, 
diarrhoea  and  low  body  temperature  (in  one  animal).  However,  due  to  the  supportive  care  given 
throughout  the  study  it  was  not  necessary  to  euthanize  these  animals.  Due  to  the  severe  diarrhoea 
and  increased  urea  nitrogen  values  at  all  dose  levels,  a  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL) 
could not be determined. After an 8-week treatment free period no clear recovery was apparent for the 
abnormal faeces or for the increased urea nitrogen.   
For  both  the  7-week  and  26-week  toxicity  study,  the  toxicokinetics  showed  exposure  to  pertuzumab 
and increased with increasing dose.   
As highlighted, the major non-clinical findings were diarrhoea, liquid and non-formed faeces. This is in 
line  with  the  clinical  studies  in  which  the  main  adverse  events  reported  with  pertuzumab  were 
diarrhoea,  fatigue  and  nausea.  In  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  it  has  in  the  clinic, 
according to the applicant, added only little toxicity to the adverse event profile. Also in the clinic, it is 
concluded that the diarrhoea is generally manageable and had no major impact on patients’ ability to 
continue  study  treatment.  According  to  the  literature,  diarrhoea  is  a  common  side  effect  of  agents 
which inhibits the EGFR/HER1 receptor. The diarrhoea seen non-clinically was without histopathological 
changes. As explained by the applicant, although the mechanism relating to the diarrhoea is not fully 
understood,  it  is  thought  to  be  caused  by  disruption  of  the  intestinal  chloride  balance  following 
inhibition of HER1/HER2 and HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation.  
In  the  26-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  increased  blood  urea  nitrogen  values  were  observed  in 
almost  all  pertuzumab  treated  animals  and  the  finding  persisted  following  a  8-week  recovery  period. 
However,  this  finding  was  not  accompanied  by  histopathological  findings  in  the  kidney  and  clinical 
safety  data  do  not  indicate  that  pertuzumab-treatment  is  associated  with  adverse  effects  on  kidney 
function.

Genotoxicity 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  submitted,  in  accordance  with  ICH  S6  (R1)  guideline.  It  is  not 
expected that peptides/proteins would interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material.  
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  submitted  According  to  ICH  S6  (R1)  guideline  standard 
carcinogenicity bioassays are generally not appropriate for biotechnology derived pharmaceuticals and 
according  to  ICH  S9  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  warranted  to  support  marketing  for  therapeutics 
intended to treat patients with late stage or advanced cancer.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
According to the ICH S9 guidance, fertility studies are not required for medicinal products indicated for 
late stage cancer. In such cases, information on the risk of effects on fertility can be obtained from the 
examination of reproductive organs in repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
No  information  could  be  obtained  on  the  potential  effect  of  pertuzumab  on  the  male  reproductive 
organs. The large majority of male Cynomolgus monkeys used in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were 
sexually immature hence only a single male undergoing high-dose (150 mg/kg) pertuzumab treatment 
was  sexually  mature.  However,  evidence  of  menses  was  noted  for  12  out  of  14  female  monkeys 
treated with pertuzumab hence the large majority of the female monkeys were sexually mature during 
the treatment period.  
No effects on the female reproductive organs were seen in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed 
with pertuzumab. 
Embryo-foetal development 
In  the  embryo-foetal  development  study,  pregnant  monkeys  were  weekly  IV  dosed  with  pertuzumab 
during the period of foetal organogenesis (gestation days (GD) 19 to 50). Maternal and foetal toxicity 
was  observed  in  all  pertuzumab  treated  groups  hence  the  NOAEL  was  below  30/10  mg/kg/week 
(loading/maintenance  dose).  Findings  consisted  of  low  amniotic  fluid  volume,  high  foetal  lethality, 
retarded  development,  and  external  (paw  hyperextension,  paw  hyperflexion  and  microtia),  visceral 
(small lungs, thin ventricular wall and ventricular septum defect, hypoplasia of the collecting glomeruli, 
renal  tubules,  collecting  tubules  and  pelvis)  and  skeletal  abnormalities  (reduced  length  of  ossified 
bones).  
Generally, for monoclonal antibodies, there is very low likelihood of teratogenic effects occurring due to 
the low direct embryonic exposure during organogenesis (Cavagnaro, JA, 2008). Hence, the observed 
external,  visceral  and  skeletal  abnormalities  were  considered  secondary  to  intrauterine  restriction 
resulting  from  the  oligohydramnios  (low  amniotic  fluid  volume).  Indeed,  in  humans  oligohydramnios 
may  be  associated  with  marked  deformation  of  the  foetus  due  to  intrauterine  constraint.  Moreover, 
oligohydramnios adversely affects foetal lung development resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. Cases of 
oligohydramnios,  some  associated  with  fatal  pulmonary  hypoplasia  of  the  foetus,  have  been  reported 
in  pregnant  women  receiving  Herceptin®  (trastuzumab).  It  that  respect,  it  is  noteworthy  that  no 
maternal  toxicity,  embryotoxicity  or  teratogenicity  was  observed  in  a  Cynomolgus  monkey  embryo-
foetal development study conducted with trastuzumab (EPAR). 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12

Because the amniotic fluid is primarily foetal urine in the latter half of the pregnancy, the absence of 
foetal  urine  production  or  blockage  in  the  foetus’  urinary  tract  can  result  in  oligohydramnios. 
Histopathologically, kidney hypoplasia was observed in all treated foetuses which were associated with 
a dose-dependent increase in severity. Tumor growth factor-alpha and EGF, both ligands of HER1, are 
expressed  in  normal  human  kidney  tissue  and  serve  to  enhance  renal  cell  proliferation,  migration, 
differentiation, and morphogenesis. EGFR and HER2 are also expressed in renal tissue. Consistent with 
this expression, pertuzumab bound to monkey and human kidney tissues in the in vitro cross-reactivity 
studies. Thus, HER-family  members play an important role in the regulation of growth, differentiation 
and  morphogenesis  of  renal  tissue  and  the  interaction  of  these  receptors  may  be  perturbed  by 
inhibition of HER2 dimerisation by pertuzumab. 
It has been reported that HER2 plays an essential role in both the developing and adult heart. Hence, 
embryos that lack the HER2 receptor die due to improper formation of the ventricular trabeculae and 
ventricular  enlargement  has  been  observed  in  adult  mice  deficient  of  ventricular  HER2  (Hynes  and 
Hale, 2005). On this basis, it cannot be excluded that the ventricular abnormalities in the foetuses are 
the result of a direct treatment-related effect.  
As  expected,  toxicokinetic  data  demonstrated  exposure  to  pertuzumab  both  in  maternal  and  foetal 
serum. At GD100, the ratios of foetal to maternal pertuzumab levels were comparable among all dose 
groups. It is not possible to calculate AUC based animal:human exposure margins as no full profile of 
toxicokinetic  samples  have  been  collected  (serum  samples  were  only  collected  pre-dose  and  30 
minutes post-dose on GD19, 36, 50 and on the day of caesarean sectioning). However, as no NOAEL 
for foetal toxicity was established in this study, it cannot be excluded that the observed foetal toxicity 
may  occur  at  therapeutic  pertuzumab  concentrations  in  human.  Hence,  as  with  trastuzumab, 
pertuzumab should be avoided during pregnancy.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
No  segment  III  studies  (pre-  and  postnatal  development)  were  submitted  in  accordance  with  ICH  S6 
(R1) and ICH S9 guidelines.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic studies were conducted in monkeys. 
In  the  7-  and  26-week  toxicity  study  measurable  levels  of  pertuzumab  were  found  occasionally  in 
individual samples from control groups at concentration levels above the lower limit of quantification.  
In the 7-week toxicity study, pertuzumab concentrations exceeded the LLOQ in 17 out of 21 samples 
from  one  monkey  (concentration  range  of  0.28  to  0.68  µg/mL).  Moreover,  the  pertuzumab 
concentration in 6 out of a total of 199 of the remaining control samples was above the LLOQ (0.29-
0.96  µg/mL).  In  the  pivotal  26-week  toxicity  study  concentrations  exceeded  the  LLOQ  in  2  out  of  12 
animals  on  two  occasions  (Day  8,  predose  and  Day  113  +1  hour  post  dose  with  pertuzumab 
concentrations of 0.251 and 0.546 µg/mL, respectively).  
Representative clinical serum exposure levels can be obtained from the clinical study BO16934. Due to 
the  loading  dose,  the  840  mg/420  mg  dosing  regimen  reached  approximate  steady-state 
concentrations  following  the  first  maintenance  dose.  AUC  and  Cmax  values  in  this  study  was  3598 
µg*day/ml  and  289  µg/ml,  respectively.  The  table  below  shows  the  exposure  levels  obtained  in  the 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  and  gives  the  calculated  animal:human  exposure  margins.  The  number 
given in bold corresponds to exposure margin at the NOAEL.

Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were submitted. The intended clinical route of administration is IV. 
No pertuzumab-related clinical observations (IV and SC) or histopathologic (IV) findings were noted at 
the injection sites when pertuzumab was administered by IV or SC injection in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in monkeys.  
Other toxicity studies 
No  antibodies  to  pertuzumab  were  detected  in  the  7-  and  26-week  toxicity  studies.  Despite  possible 
interference  in  the  ELISA  assays,  it  appears  that  pertuzumab  was  not  immunogenic  in  Cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Pertuzumab and pertuzumab vehicle did not cause haemolysis of human or monkey erythrocytes and 
were compatible with Cynomolgus monkey and human serum and plasma. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted for pertuzumab in accordance with the "Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human  use" (EMEA, 2006). Peptides are 
exempted  from  the  need  to  provide  an  environmental  risk  assessment,  because  they  are  unlikely  to 
result in significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based  on  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacodynamic  data,  there  is  a  clear  rationale  for  the  inclusion  of 
pertuzumab  in  a  drug  combination  regimen  in  the  treatment  of  breast  cancer.  No  effects  on  safety 
pharmacology  end  points  (respiratory  and  cardiovascular)  were  noted  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies. 
The major finding made in the Cynomolgus repeat-dose toxicity studies was severe diarrhoea which led 
to the need for intensive supportive care and in one case it was necessary to euthanize the animal. In 
line  with  ICH  S6  and  S9  guidance,  no  studies  on  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  have  been 
performed.  
According to the ICH S9 guidance, fertility studies are not required for medicinal products indicated for 
late stage cancer. In such cases, information on the risk of effects on fertility can be obtained from the

examination  of  reproductive  organs  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  In  the  present  application,  the 
large  majority  of  male  Cynomolgus  monkeys  used  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  sexually 
immature  hence  only  a  single  male  undergoing  high-dose  (150  mg/kg)  pertuzumab  treatment  was 
sexually mature. As a result, no information could be obtained on the potential effect of pertuzumab on 
the  male  reproductive  organs.  However,  evidence  of  menses  was  noted  for  12  out  of  14  female 
monkeys  treated  with  pertuzumab  hence  the  large  majority  of  the  female  monkeys  were  sexually 
mature  during  the  treatment  period.  No  effects  on  the  female  reproductive  organs  were  seen  in  the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with pertuzumab. 
Findings made in the Cynomolgus monkeys embryo-fetal development study, consisted of low amniotic 
fluid  volume,  high  fetal  lethality,  retarded  development,  and  external  (paw  hyperextension,  paw 
hyperflexion  and  microtia),  visceral  (small  lungs,  thin  ventricular  wall  and  ventricular  septum  defect, 
hypoplasia  of  the  collecting  glomeruli,  renal  tubules,  collecting  tubules  and  pelvis)  and  skeletal 
abnormalities  (reduced  length  of  ossified  bones).  The  observed  external,  visceral  and  skeletal 
abnormalities were considered secondary to intrauterine restriction resulting from the oligohydramnios 
(low  amniotic  fluid  volume).  Indeed,  in  humans  oligohydramnios  may  be  associated  with  marked 
deformation  and  growth  restriction  of  the  fetus  due  to  intrauterine  constraint.  Moreover, 
oligohydramnios  adversely  affects  fetal  lung  development  resulting  in  pulmonary  hypoplasia. 
Histopathologically, kidney hypoplasia was observed in all treated fetuses and this was associated with 
a dose-dependent increase in severity. HER-family members play an important role in the regulation of 
growth,  differentiation  and  morphogenesis  of  renal  tissue  and  the  interaction  of  these  receptors  may 
be  perturbed  by  inhibition  of  HER2  dimerisation  by  pertuzumab.  Moreover,  it  is  likely  that  the 
ventricular  abnormalities  in  the  fetuses  were  the  result  of  a  direct  treatment-related  effect.  As  no 
NOAEL  for  fetal  toxicity  was  established  in  this  study,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  observed  fetal 
toxicity may occur at therapeutic pertuzumab concentrations in humans. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  line  with  ICH  S6  and  S9  guidance,  no  studies  on  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  have  been 
performed.  
No  specific  fertility  studies  in  animals  have  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  pertuzumab.  No 
definitive conclusion on adverse effects can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in cynomolgus 
monkey repeated dose toxicity study. 
Reproductive  toxicology  studies  have  been  conducted  in  pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  (Gestational 
Day (GD) 19 through to GD 50) at initial doses of 30 to 150 mg/kg followed by bi-weekly doses of 10 
to 100 mg/kg. These dose levels resulted in clinically relevant exposures of 2.5 to 20-fold greater than 
the recommended human dose, based on Cmax. Intravenous administration of pertuzumab from GD19 
through GD50 (period of organogenesis) was embryotoxic, with dose-dependent increases in embryo-
foetal death between GD25 to GD70. The incidences of embryo-foetal loss were 33, 50, and 85% for 
pregnant  female  monkeys  treated  with  bi-weekly  pertuzumab  doses  of  10,  30,  and  100  mg/kg, 
respectively (2.5 to 20-fold greater than the recommended human dose, based on Cmax). At Caesarean 
section  on  GD100,  oligohydramnios,  decreased  relative  lung  and  kidney  weights  and  microscopic 
evidence  of  renal  hypoplasia  consistent  with  delayed  renal  development  were  identified  in  all 
pertuzumab  dose  groups.  In  addition,  consistent  with  foetal  growth  restrictions,  secondary  to 
oligohydramnios,  lung  hypoplasia  (1  of  6  in  30 mg/kg  and  1  of  2  in100  mg/kg  groups),  ventricular 
septal defects (1 of 6 in 30 mg/kg group), thin ventricular wall (1 of 2 in 100 mg/kg group) and minor 
skeletal  defects  (external  -  3  of  6  in  30  mg/kg  group)  were  also  noted.    Pertuzumab  exposure  was 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 42/123 
 
 
 
 
reported  in  offspring  from  all  treated  groups,  at  levels  of  29%  to  40%  of  maternal  serum  levels  at 
GD100.  
In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  weekly  intravenous  administration  of  pertuzumab  at  doses  up  to  150 
mg/kg/dose  was  generally  well  tolerated.  With  doses  of  15  mg/kg  and  higher,  intermittent  mild 
treatment-associated  diarrhoea  was  noted.  In  a  subset  of  monkeys,  chronic  dosing  (7  to  26  weekly 
doses)  resulted  in  episodes  of  severe  secretory  diarrhoea.  The  diarrhoea  was  managed  (with  the 
exception of euthanasia of one animal, 50 mg/kg/dose) with supportive care including intravenous fluid 
replacement therapy. 
These main non-clinical findings are appropriately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  non  clinical  aspect  the  following  statements  to  address  the 
potential risk of pertuzumab in pregnant women have been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC: 
•  Women  of  childbearing  potential  and  male  patients  with  female  partners  of  childbearing 
potential, must use effective contraception while receiving Perjeta and for 6 months following 
the last dose of Perjeta. 
• 
There  is  limited  amount  of  data  from  the  use  of  pertuzumab  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in 
animals  have  shown  reproductive  toxicity.  Perjeta  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and 
in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
•  Because  human  IgG  is  secreted  in  human  milk  and  the  potential  for  absorption  and  harm  to 
the  infant  is  unknown,  a  decision  should  be  made  to  discontinue  breast-feeding  or  to 
discontinue  treatment,  taking  into  account  the  benefit  of  breast-feeding  for  the  child  and  the 
benefit of Perjeta therapy for the woman 
•  No  specific  fertility  studies  in  animals  have  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
pertuzumab. Only very limited data are available from repeat-dose toxicity studies with respect 
to  the  risk  for  adverse  effects  on  the  male  reproductive  system.  No  adverse  effects  were 
observed in sexually mature female cynomolgus monkeys exposed to pertuzumab.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Quantitation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab 
A  validated  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  was  used  to  measure  pertuzumab 
concentrations  in  serum  samples  from  patients  in  studies  BO16934,  BO17003,  BO17004,  BO17021, 
JO17076,  TOC2297g,  TOC2572g,  TOC2682g,  TOC2689g,  TOC3258g,  and  WO20024  (all  studies  in 
which  pertuzumab  was  administered  without  concurrent  trastuzumab).  The  minimum  quantifiable 
concentration (MQC) in human serum was 400ng/mL. 
A  subsequent  validated  ELISA  was  used  to  measure  pertuzumab  in  the  presence  of  trastuzumab  in 
serum samples from patients in study WO20698/TOC4129g. The MQC in human serum was 150 ng/mL. 
Perjeta

Rev04.12 
Page 45/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A third ELISA was used to measure trastuzumab in the presence of pertuzumab in serum samples from 
patients in study WO20698/TOC4129g. The MQC in human serum was 200 ng/mL. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pertuzumab PK parameter values were derived from pertuzumab concentration-time data from studies 
where  pertuzumab  was  administered  as  a  single  agent  or  in  combination  with  a  range  of  therapeutic 
agents in a variety of oncology indications. Characterization of the PK of pertuzumab was estimated by 
compartmental  and  non-compartmental  methods,  population  pharmacokinetic  (popPK)  and  covariate 
analyses. 
In the PopPK analysis pertuzumab serum concentration data consisting of 4525 samples obtained from 
481  cancer  patients    across  twelve  Phase  I/II/III  studies  were  analyzed  by  nonlinear  mixed  effects 
modeling  using  the  software  package  NONMEM  7,  version  7.1.2  with  the  firstorder  conditional 
estimation (FOCE) method. 
Absorption  
Bioequivalence  
During  the  development  of  pertuzumab,  biocomparability  of  different  generations  of  drug  substance 
and  drug  product  was  established  using  a  comprehensive  strategy  comprising  in  vitro  binding 
characterization,  antiproliferative  activity  and  nonclinical  PK  studies.  Once  biocomparability  was 
demonstrated, no additional clinical biocomparability studies were conducted. 
Distribution 
Following  intravenous  infusion,  the  estimated  mean  values  for  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state 
(Vss) were 3.53-7.05 L. The large range is the result of the different sampling times in various studies. 
In general the parameters are very  similar across studies and represent values expected for an IgG1 
monoclonal antibody.  
In  the  final  PopPK  analysis  model,  elimination  clearance  (CL)  was  0.239  L/day  (2.1%  SE),  and  the 
central  compartment  volume  (Vc)  was  3.07  L  (1.2%  SE).  Inter-individual  variability  in  CL  and  Vc 
expressed  as  CV%  were  34.5%  and  19.3%  respectively.  Distribution  clearance  (Q)  was  0.558  L/day 
(8.4%  SE),  and  peripheral  volume  (Vp)  was  2.36  L  (3.5%  SE).  The  median  distribution  and  terminal 
elimination  half-lives  were  1.5  days  (95%  range:  0.9-2.24  days)  and  17.2  days  (95%  range:  7.8-32 
days) respectively.  
In the PopPK analysis albumin was identified as a statistically significant covariate on pertuzumab PK. 
Clearance decreased in patients with higher albumin concentration. After inclusion of albumin and lean 
body  weight  in  the  final  popPK  model,  the  inter-individual  variance  in  CL  decreased  by  21.7%, 
explaining app. 1/5 of the inter-individual variance in CL. 
Although  these  covariates  were  statistically  significant,  the  magnitude  of  their  effects  on  pertuzumab 
exposure  (AUC  and  Cmax)  was  assessed  to  be  minimal  compared  to  the  inter-individual  variability  of 
the population such that dose adjustment for the identified covariates would not be expected to result 
in a meaningful change in pertuzumab exposure variability.

Elimination 
Excretion 
Large molecule monocloncal antibodies are known to be cleared primarily by target mediated clearance 
as well as simple non-target specific IgG clearance mechanisms. Clearance across studies ranged from 
0.232 – 0.329 L/day and T½ ranged from 11.1 – 22.3 days. Pertuzumab is not cleared via the kidney 
nor is it eliminated via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Single dosing in single-agent studies 
Results  from  the  two  dose  escalating  studies  TOC2297g  and  JO17076  showed  that  Cmax  after  single 
dose adminstration increased in a proportional manner with increasing doses of pertuzumab:

Dose proportionality after multiple-dose (steady-state) 
Four  clinical  phase  1  and  2  studies  compared  the  two  fixed  dosing  regimens:  840  mg  loading  dose 
followed by 420 mg q3w as maintenance dose and 1050 mg q3w. In studies TOC2689g, BO16934 and 
BO17004 pertuzumab was administered alone and in study BO17021 pertuzumab was administered in 
combination with other anti-cancer drugs.  
Pertuzumab appeared to show dose proportionality at steady state (Figures 13-16, Table 45).

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  was  34.5%  for  Cl  and  19.3%for  Vc.  Inter-individual  variability  was 
assessed in the population PK analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The  Phase  III  study  WO20698/TOC4129g  investigated  the  combination  of  pertuzumab  with 
trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  in  patients  with  HER2  positive  first  line  locally  recurrent  unresectable  or 
metastatic  breast  cancer  patients  (MBC).  Sparse  sampling  of  pertuzumab  did  not  allow  for  the 
estimation of CL, Vss or t 1/2, but the trough and peak concentrations (table 19) for pertuzumab were 
not different from those seen in the other clinical studies. Values of Cmin and Cmax were comparable, 
but no formal comparison between MBC patients and other patients were presented in the dossier. 
Population  PK  results  showed  that  the  median  clearance  of  the  patients  in  the  pivotal  study 
WO20698/TOC4129g  was  lower  than  the  estimated  value  for  all  studies  (0.191  L/day  versus  0.239 
L/day). This might be due to the fact that patients from study WO20698/TOC4129g had a lower LBW 
(46 kg versus 48 kg in all studies) and higher albumin (4.3 g/dL versus 3.9 g/dL in all studies). The PK 
in these patients was found to be within the range of predictions of the popPK model, after adjusting 
for  albumin  and  LBW,  which  suggests  that  pertuzumab  PK  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and 
docetaxel in untreated HER2+ MBC is similar to that in patients receiving pertuzumab in other Phase 
I/II studies, in which pertuzumab was administered as a single monoclonal antibody-based treatment 
(Figure 13).

Overall in the clinical studies, 147 of 444 patients were male gender, which was evaluated as covariate 
in the Population PK analysis. Gender did not influence pertuzumab PK.  
Race 
Study JO17076 was performed in Japanese patients with solid tumors. No difference in PK parameters 
compared to the other clinical studies was observed. 
Weight 
Based  on  population  PK  modelling,  weight  appeared  to  impact  the  trough  level  of  pertuzumab  as 
shown in the table below.

Elderly 
Age as a covariate in the Population PK analysis did not influence pertuzumab PK.  
Children 
There were no PK data of pertuzumab in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Population PK analysis 
A  popPK  analysis  was  conducted  using  pertuzumab  concentration  data  (n=3890)    from  444  cancer 
patients  across  twelve  Phase  I/II/III  studies  to  estimate  typical  values  and  inter-patient  variability  of 
PK  parameters.  However;  concentration  data  (n=635)  from  37  patients  were  inadvertently  excluded 
and  a  new  PopPK  analysis  was  conducted  with  concentration  data  (n=4525)  in  481  patients.  The 
amendment  of  the  additional  concentration  data  in  the  updated  PopPK  analysis  did  not  change  the 
conclusions made from the first PopPK analysis. 
The objectives of the popPK analysis were to: 
•  Describe  the  PK  of  pertuzumab  in  cancer  patients  using  popPK  modeling.  Quantify  typical  PK 
parameter values and associated inter-individual variability. 
•  Determine the effects of demographic, disease, target-related and pathophysiological covariates on 
pertuzumab PK parameters. 
•  Confirm the selection of fixed, non-weight-based doses for routine clinical use. 
•  Compare  pertuzumab  PK  between  the  Phase  III  (WO20698/TOC4129g)  population  and  the  other 
Phase I/II populations.

The data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling using the software package NONMEM 7, 
version 7.1.2 with the first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method.  
The  population  PK  model  development  screened  for  a  number  of  clinically  relevant  covariates  to 
determine if they contributed to inter-individual variability in PK parameter estimates.  
The  covariate  selection  was  based  on  potential  biological  and  clinical  rationale  and/or  previous 
experience  with  similar  IgG1  monoclonal  antibodies  and  included  demographic  variables  (age,  LBW, 
sex,  race),  laboratory  variables  indicating  hepatic  functions  (ALT,  AST,  TBIL,  ALBU)  and  ALK,  serum 
creatinine  (as  a  marker  of  renal  function)  and  disease  variables  (ECOG/KPS,  presence/absence  MBC, 
number of metastatic sites, liver metastases and concomitant chemotherapy.  
The results of this analysis showed that inter-patient variability was modest, across a large number of 
patient demographic and laboratory variables. Only serum albumin and lean body weight were found to 
significantly  influence  the  PK  behavior  of  pertuzumab.  However  sensitivity  analyses  performed  at  the 
recommended  dose  and  schedule  of  pertuzumab  showed  that  at  the  extreme  values  of  these  two 
covariates, there was no significant impact on the ability to achieve target steady-state concentrations 
identified in preclinical tumor xenograft models. Overall, the population PK analysis supported the use 
of  the  recommended  pertuzumab  dosing  regimen  of  a  840  mg  loading  dose  followed  by  a  420  mg 
maintenance dose administered on an every three week schedule. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vivo 
No  dedicated  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  studies  were  performed  and  a  sub-study  from  the  pivotal 
study WO20698/TOC4129g served as the in vivo interaction study. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. 
Mechanism of action 
Nonclinical  studies  have  shown  that  the  modes  of  action  of  trastuzumab  and  pertuzumab  are 
complementary.  In  vivo  studies  in  tumour-bearing  mice  using  Near  Infrared  Fluorescence  optical 
imaging  techniques,  have  demonstrated  that  binding  of  each  drug  when  given  in  combination  is  not 
impaired. These data thus suggest there is no negative drug-interaction at the receptor-binding level. 
In  nonclinical  studies  the  combination  of  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  was  shown  to  synergistically 
inhibit  the  growth  of  tumor  xenografts  derived  from  HER2-overexpressing  non-small  cell  lung  cancer 
(NSCLC)  Calu-3  cells  and  from  KPL-4  breast  cancer  cells  in  immune  deficient  mouse  models.    In 
addition  to  blocking  signal  transduction,  both  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  are  capable  of  inducing 
antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  However,  the  combination  of  the  two 
monoclonal antibodies using in vitro models with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, does not 
result in ADCC activity greater than that observed with each drug given individually. 
Almost  all  supporting  studies  in  the  development  programme  for  pertuzumab  recruited  patients 
unselected  for  HER2  status  and  HER2-negative  MBC  patients.  Overall  the  efficacy  of  pertuzumab  in 
montherapy  in  these  studies  was  low  and  pertuzumab  did  not  appear  to  improve  the  efficacy  of 
standard chemotherapy.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
No clinical dose-finding studies were performed. The target dose has been determined by non-clinical 
considerations. 
The pivotal Phase III trial (WO20698/TOC4129g) used the fixed (non-weight based) dosing regimen of 
840 mg loading dose followed by a 420 mg maintenance dose administered q3wk in combination with 
trastuzumab and docetaxel. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No formal QTc study was performed. 
A sub-study was conducted to investigate the potential of pertuzumab to prolong the QTc interval and 
other ECG parameters within the Phase III Study WO20698/TOC4129g. The sub-study was designed to 
enroll  a  total  of  50  ECG-evaluable  patients  and  at  least  40  PK-evaluable  patients.  There  were  two 
analysis  components:  1)  a  statistical  analysis  of  ECG  data,  and  2)  a  concentration–QTC  (C-QTc) 
analysis. 
Based  on  C-QTc  modeling  and  statistical  analysis  of  ECG  parameters,  results  from  this  sub-study 
indicate that pertuzumab does not have a clinically relevant effect on QTcF and other ECG parameters 
in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  pertuzumab  has  been  sufficiently  investigated,  based  on  non-clinical  dose-
response studies from which the target concentration was determined. The current dose proposal has 
been adequately discussed. Population PK analysis  showed that for lower doses than the proposed of 
pertuzumab  (840/420  mg)  unacceptable  large  percentages  of  patients  would  not  achieve  the  target 
concentration of 20 µg/ml.  
A  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  with  data  from  481  patients  across  different 
clinical  trials  (phase  I,  II  and  III)  with  various  types  of  advanced  malignancies  who  had  received 
Perjeta as a single agent or in combination at doses ranging from 2 to 25 mg/kg administered every 3 
weeks as a 30-60 minutes intravenous infusion. 
Perjeta is administered as an intravenous infusion.  There have been no studies performed with other 
routes of administration. 
Across  all  clinical  studies,  the  volume  of  distribution  of  the  central  (Vc)  and  the  peripheral  (Vp) 
compartment in the typical patient, was 3.11 litres and 2.46 litres, respectively. 
The  metabolism  of  Perjeta  has  not  been  directly  studied.  Antibodies  are  cleared  principally  by 
catabolism. 
The median clearance (CL) of Perjeta was 0.235 litres/day and the median half-life was 18 days. 
Perjeta displayed linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 58/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based  on  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  no  significant  difference  was  observed  in  the 
pharmacokinetics of Perjeta between patients < 65 years (n=306) and patients ≥ 65 years (n=175). 
No  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in  the  elderly  population  ≥  65  years  of  age.  Very  limited  data  are 
available in patients > 75 years of age. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
No  dedicated  renal  impairment  trial  for  Perjeta  has  been  conducted.  Based  on  the  results  of  the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, Perjeta exposure in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 
60 to 90 ml/min, N=200) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 60 ml/min, N=71) was similar to 
that  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  (CLcr  greater  than  90  ml/min,  N=200).  No  relationship 
between  CLcr  and  Perjeta  exposure  was  observed  over  the  range  of  CLcr  (27  to  244  ml/min).  As 
indicated in the SmPC, dose adjustments of Perjeta are not needed in patients with mild or moderate 
renal  impairment.  No  dose  recommendations  can  be  made  for  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment 
because of the limited pharmacokinetic data available. 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Perjeta  have  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.    No 
specific dose recommendations can be made. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
The population PK analysis suggested no PK differences based on age, gender and ethnicity (Japanese 
versus  non-Japanese).  Baseline  albumin  and  lean  body  weight  were  the  most  significant  covariates 
influencing CL. CL decreased in patients with higher baseline albumin concentrations and increased in 
patients  with  greater  lean  body  weight.  However  sensitivity  analyses  performed  at the  recommended 
dose and schedule of Perjeta showed that at the extreme values of these two covariates, there was no 
significant  impact  on  the  ability  to  achieve  target  steady-state  concentrations  identified  in  preclinical 
tumour xenograft models. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the dosage of Perjeta based on these 
covariates.  
No  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  interactions  were  observed  between  Perjeta  and  trastuzumab,  or  between 
Perjeta  and  docetaxel  in  a  sub-study  of  37  patients  in  the  randomised,  pivotal  trial  CLEOPATRA.  In 
addition,  in  the  population  PK  analysis,  no  evidence  of  a  drug-drug  interaction  has  been  shown 
between Perjeta and trastuzumab and between Perjeta and docetaxel. 
Four  studies  have  evaluated  the  effects  of  Perjeta  on  the  PK  of  co-administered  cytotoxic  agents, 
docetaxel,  gemcitabine,  erlotinib  and  capecitabine,  respectively.  There  was  no  evidence  of  any  PK 
interaction  between  Perjeta  and  any  of  these  agents.  The  PK  of  Perjeta  in  these  studies  was 
comparable to those observed in single-agent studies. 
This interaction information is included in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme of Perjeta was considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The clinical efficacy submission is based on one pivotal phase III study (CLEOPATRA) with pertuzumab 
(420mg  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion)  in  patients  with  locally  advanced/metastatic  HER2 
positive  breast  cancer  and  is  supported  by  2  phase  II  studies:  1)  study  WO20697  (NEOSPHERE)  in 
HER2+ patients in the neoadjuvant setting of EBC and 2) study BO17929 in pre-treated patients with

metastatic  HER2+  disease  who  had  progressed  during  treatment  with  trastuzumab  and  who  had 
received ≤ 3 lines of therapy. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two  of  the  Phase  I  studies  were  ascending  dose  studies  in  which  pertuzumab  was  administered  as  a 
single agent to patients with advanced solid tumors, in doses of 0.5 up to 25 mg/kg administered as 
an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  every  three  weeks  (q3w).  One  study  (TOC2297g)  was  conducted  in 
Caucasian patients in the West and the other (JO17076) in Japanese patients. 
Pertuzumab was subsequently tested in Phase Ib and II studies as a single agent (Studies TOC2689g, 
TOC2682g,  TOC2572g,  BO17004,  BO16934,  and  TOC2664g)  or  in  combination  with  cytotoxic  and 
other  anti-cancer  agents,  including  gemcitabine  (Study  TOC3258g),  capecitabine  (Study  BO17003), 
erlotinib  (Study  WO20024),  docetaxel  (Study  BO17021)  and  carboplatin-based  chemotherapy 
(BO17931).  
In early clinical development, two fixed (non-weight-based) pertuzumab regimens were tested: 
•  840 mg loading IV dose followed by 420 mg IV doses q3w  
•  1050 mg IV dose q3w (with no initial loading dose).  
Population  PK  analysis  based  on  the  data  from  Phase  Ib/II  studies  with  single-agent  pertuzumab 
predicted  that  >90%  of  patients  receiving  the  fixed,  non-weight-based  dosing  regimen  (840  mg 
loading  dose  with  a  420  mg  maintenance  dose)  would  achieve  steady-state  trough  serum 
concentrations  that  were  higher  than  the  target  serum  concentration  (>  20  μg/mL,  the  target  for 
efficacy  predicted  from  nonclinical  models).  Since  the  target  concentrations  were  achieved  by  this 
dosing regimen, the higher dose of 1050 mg was not selected. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
WO20698C/TOC4129g  (CLEOPATRA) – A Phase III, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled 
Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel vs. Placebo

Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
Patients had to fulfil all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study: 
Disease-specific inclusion criteria: 
•  Histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  with  locally  recurrent  or 
metastatic disease, and candidate for chemotherapy. Patients with measurable and/or non-measurable 
disease were eligible. Patients with bone only metastases were eligible provided they had some bone 
metastases  that  had  not  been  previously  irradiated  and  had  tumor  tissue  samples  from  the  primary 
tumor available for central HER2 testing and subsequent biomarkers analysis. Locally recurrent disease

must not be amenable to resection with curative intent. Patients with de-novo Stage IV disease were 
eligible. 
•  HER2-positive  (defined  as  3+  IHC  or  FISH  amplification  ratio  ≥  2.0)  MBC  confirmed  by  a  Sponsor-
designated  central  laboratory.  It  was  strongly  recommended  that  a  formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE)  tissue  block  from  the  primary  tumor  (or  metastatic  if  the  primary  was  not  available)  be 
submitted for central laboratory confirmation of HER2 eligibility; however, if that was not possible, 25 
unstained  and  freshly  cut  slides  were  to  be  submitted.  The  tissue  was  used  subsequently  used  for 
assessment of biomarkers. 
General inclusion criteria: 
• Age ≥ 18 years. 
• LVEF ≥ 50% at baseline (within 42 days of randomization) as determined by either ECHO or MUGA 
(ECHO being the preferred method. If the patient was randomized to the study, the same method of 
LVEF assessment, ECHO or MUGA, was to be used throughout the study, and to the extent possible, be 
obtained  at  the  same  institution).  All  available  historic  LVEF  values  during  and  post-trastuzumab 
adjuvant treatment for patients who received such adjuvant therapy prior to enrollment into the study 
were collected. 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. 
•  For  women  of  childbearing  potential  and  men  with  partners  of  childbearing  potential,  agreement  to 
use  a  highly  effective,  non-hormonal  form  of  contraception  or  two  effective  forms  of  non-hormonal 
contraception  by  the  patient  and/or  partner.  Contraception  use  was  to  continue  for  the  duration  of 
study treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients whose 
partners were pregnant should use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy. 
• Signed, written informed consent (approved by the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics 
Committee) obtained prior to any study procedure 
Exclusion criteria 
Any of the following was regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study: 
Cancer-related exclusion criteria: 
• History of anti-cancer therapy for MBC (with the exception of one prior hormonal regimen for MBC, 
which  had  to  be  stopped  prior  to  randomization).  Anti-cancer  therapy  for  MBC  included  any  EGFR  or 
anti-HER2 agents or vaccines, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or more than one prior hormonal regimen for 
MBC. One prior hormonal ‘regimen’ for MBC could have included more than one hormonal therapy. If a 
patient switched therapy due to toxicity or local standard practice, and not due to PD, this was counted 
as one ‘regimen’. If a patient received hormonal therapy for MBC and switched to a different hormonal 
therapy due to PD, this was counted as two ‘regimens’ and the patient was not eligible. 
• History of approved or investigative tyrosine kinase/HER inhibitors for breast cancer in any treatment 
setting, except trastuzumab used in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 
History of systemic breast cancer treatment in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting with a disease-free 
interval  from  completion  of  the  systemic  treatment  (excluding  hormonal  therapy)  to  metastatic

Treatments 
Patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two 
treatment arms to receive: 
Arm A : Placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel (Pla+T+D). 
Placebo: IV infusion every 3 weeks (q3w) 
Trastuzumab: loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w 
• 
• 
•  Docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2 IV q3w for at least six cycles 
Arm B: Pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel (Ptz+T+D). 
Pertuzumab: loading dose of 840 mg/kg IV, followed by 420 mg/kg IV q3w 
Trastuzumab: loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w 
• 
• 
•  Docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2 IV q3w for at least six cycles 
At the investigator’s discretion, the docetaxel dose could be increased to 100 mg/m2 for patients who 
tolerated  at  least  one  cycle  without  significant  toxicities.  After  Cycle  6,  continuation  of  docetaxel 
treatment is at the discretion of the patient and treating physician.  
Treatment  was  given  until  investigator-assessed  radiographic  or  clinical  progressive  disease  (PD), 
unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. If pertuzumab/placebo and/or trastuzumab had 
to  be  permanently  discontinued  or  withheld  for  more  than  two  cycles,  the  patient  was  taken  off  the 
study  treatment.  However,  if  docetaxel  had  to  be  permanently  discontinued  for  reasons  related  to 
toxicity, the patient could continue with pertuzumab/placebo and trastuzumab. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS), based on tumor assessments 
by an independent review facility (IRF), between patients in the two treatment arms. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to: 
•  Compare overall survival (OS) between the two treatment arms. 
•  Compare PFS between the two treatment arms based on investigator assessment of progression. 
•  Compare the overall objective response rate (ORR) between the two treatment arms. 
•  Compare the duration of objective response between the two treatment arms. 
•  Compare the safety profile between the two treatment arms. 
•  Compare the time to symptom progression between the two treatment arms, as assessed by the 
FACT Trial Outcome Index—Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB). 
• 
Evaluate if biomarkers from tumor tissues or blood samples (eg, HER3 expression, Fcγ-Receptor, 
and serum ECD/HER2 and/or HER ligand concentrations) correlate with clinical outcomes.

Sample size 
The  primary  analysis  of  PFS  was  planned  for  when  approximately  381  IRF-assessed  PFS  events  had 
occurred.  It  was  estimated  that  a  total  of  381  IRF-assessed  PFS  events  would  provide  approximately 
80% power to detect a 33% improvement in median PFS (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.75 with a two-sided 
significance level of 5%).  
In designing the study, median PFS for the control group was assumed to be 10.5 months, improving 
to 14 months with the addition of pertuzumab, assuming that PFS is exponentially distributed. 
An interim analysis of OS was performed at the time of the primary analysis of PFS. To account for this 
interim analysis of OS, a Lan−deMets α-spending function with the O’Brien−Fleming stopping boundary 
was applied to the OS analyses. The protocol estimated that approximately 50% of the total 385 
required  deaths  (193 deaths)  would  have  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS  (under 
this assumption the alpha level for the first OS analysis would be 0.0031). 
The  final  analysis  of  OS  was  planned  to  take  place  after  385  deaths  have  occurred,  which  wouldl 
provide 80% power to detect a 33% improvement in OS (median OS for the control group is assumed 
to be 36 months).  
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  
An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) was used to collect patient screening information and to 
randomize eligible patients to one of the two treatment arms. A complete block randomization scheme 
was applied to achieve balance in treatment assignment within each of the eight strata, as defined by 
prior treatment status (de novo vs prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) and region (Europe, North 
America, South America and Asia).  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The  population  for  the  primary  analysis  was  the  Intent-to-Treat  Population:  All  randomized  patients 
were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population 
The difference in primary endpoint, IRF-assessed progression-free survival, between the two treatment 
arms  was  compared  using  a  two-sided  log-rank  test  at  5%  significance  level,  stratified  by  prior 
treatment  status  (de  novo  and  prior  adjuvant  or  neo-adjuvant  therapy)  and  region  (Europe,  North 
America, South America, and Asia).

The  following  fixed-sequence  testing  hierarchy  was  used  at  the  time  of  the  primary  PFS  analysis  to 
adjust for multiple statistical testing of IRF-assessed PFS, OS and ORR for the purposes of confirmatory 
statistical testing: 
1.  Test  the  primary  endpoint,  IRF-assessed  PFS,  at  a  two-sided  5%  significance  level.  If  positive, 
continue to Step 2; otherwise, stop. 
2.  Test  OS  at  an  overall  two-sided  5%  significance  level.  If  positive,  continue  to  Step  3;  otherwise, 
stop. 
3. Test ORR at a two-sided 5% significance level. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The first patient was enrolled in the pivotal CLEOPATRA study on 12 February 2008. The date for data 
cut-off  for  the  primary  PFS  analysis  was  on  13  May  2011.  In  total  1196  patients  were  screened  and 
808  patients  (N)  were  enrolled  and  randomized  to  one  of  two  treatment  arms:  Pla+T+D  (n=406 
patients)  or  Ptz+T+D  (n=  402  patients).  Overall,  patients  were  enrolled  from  204  centres  in  25 
countries.  Two  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  did  not  receive  any  study  treatment  due  to  elevated 
liver transaminase levels (3) or a withdrawn consent (1).

Patients withdrawn prematurely from treatment 
At the time of data cut-off, 279 patients (70%) had been withdrawn from treatment in the Placebo arm 
(227 due to progressive disease / 31 for safety reasons) compared to 233 (57%) in the Ptz arm (180 
due to progressive disease /30 for safety reasons). 121 patients (29.8%) were still on treatment in the 
Placebo arm compared to 171 patients (42.5%) in the Ptz arm. 96 patients in the Placebo arm vs. 69

patients in the Ptz arm had died. Overall, these figures seem to be in favour of the Ptz-containing arm. 
A similar number of patients withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up across treatment arms (23 vs. 
18). 
A number of protocol violations have been identified. Most of these violations were considered minor in 
nature, they were equally distributed across treatment arms and they are not considered to have had 
an impact on the outcome of the pivotal study. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 12 February 2008 and 13 May 2011, in 25 countries (Brazil, Canada, 
China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Ecuador, France, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Guatemala, Italy, Japan, 
Latvia, Macedonia, Mexico, Poland, Republic of Argentina, Republic of Korea, Republic of the Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, USA). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol  violations  were  reported  in  relation  to  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  and  on-study  procedures 
and  assessments.  None  of  the  violations  relating  to  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  granted 
prospectively; all were identified after the patient had been enrolled in the study. The great majority of 
the protocol violations were due to an assessment being out of the study-defined time window for that 
assessment,  ie,  they  were  minor  deviations  from  the  protocol  of  no  clinical  significance.  None  led  to 
exclusion of a patient from the efficacy or safety analysis populations. Approximately 60% of patients 
in  each  treatment  arm  had  at  least  one  protocol  violation  reported  (246  patients  in  each  treatment 
arm). 
Violations of Inclusion Criteria 
Approximately 1% of patients in each arm violated one of the inclusion criteria defined for the study. 
However,  approximately  12%  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  overall  were  categorized  as  having 
violated an inclusion criterion because baseline tumor assessments were outside the 28-day screening 
window.  In  addition,  four  patients  were  randomized  despite  violations  of  the  entry  criteria  but  never 
received study medication.  
Violations of Exclusion Criteria 
Violation  of  an  exclusion  criterion  occurred  for  98  patients  (24.1%)  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  81 
patients (20.1%) in the Ptz+T+D arm. These violations mainly related to exclusion criterion number 14 
(149  patients  overall;  78  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  71  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm).  This  exclusion  criterion 
defines  minimum  laboratory  test  requirements  for  bone  marrow,  liver  and  renal  function. 
Approximately 50% (86/149) of violations within this category were due to missing INR and aPTT (or 
PTT) results at screening (48/78 in the Pla+T+D arm and 38/71 in the Ptz+T+D arm). This arose from 
a  common  misunderstanding  amongst  investigators.  Many  thought  that  baseline  assessments  of 
INR/aPTT  were  only  required  for  patients  receiving  anti-coagulant  therapy.  In  fact,  these  tests  were 
intended to provide additional information on liver function in all patients, since patients with hepatic 
impairment  are  known  to  be  more  susceptible  to  docetaxel  toxicity.  However,  since  docetaxel  is 
routinely given in clinical practice without assessment of INR/aPPT, omission of this baseline test was 
not  considered  a  concern  for  patient  safety.  Of  the  remaining  violations  of  exclusion  criterion  no.14, 
14/78  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  14/71  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  were  for  results  obtained  before  the  first 
dose  but  after  randomization.  In  each  of  these  cases,  none  of  the  patients  had  a  value  that  was 
outside of the ranges required by the protocol. The remaining 16/78 violations in the Pla+T+D arm and 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 66/123 
 
 
 
19/71  violations  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  were  either  for  missing  test  results  or  results  outside  of  the 
requirements of the protocol. 
Violations of On-Study Procedures 
On-study  violations  were  reported  for  193  patients  (47.5%)  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  201  patients 
(50.0%) in the Ptz+T+D arm. The most common (approximately 40% in each arm) on-study violations 
were related to ECHO/MUGA scans or tumor assessments being performed outside the protocol-defined 
window  of  9  weeks  ±  7  days.  Although  the  overall  number  of  protocol  violations  appears  high,  the 
majority  of  violations  was  minor  in  nature  (see  listing  of  protocol  violations),  and  did  not  affect 
individual  patient  safety.  In  cases  where  the  study  team  was  made  aware  of  a  patient  being 
randomized  despite  violating  an  inclusion  or  exclusion  criterion,  permission  was  only  granted  for  the 
patient to continue to receive study treatment if this raised no safety concerns. 
Early Withdrawals due to Protocol Violations 
Only  three  patients,  one  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  and  two  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm,  withdrew  from  study 
treatment  due  to  protocol  violations  (1  patient  with  no  treatment-free  interval  between  adjuvant 
systemic  therapy  and  diagnosis  of  metastatic  disease,  1  patient  had  brain  lesions  on  her  baseline 
tumor  assessment,  1  patient  had  experienced  an  LVEF  reduction  to  38%  whilst  on  previous 
trastuzumab therapy). 
A total of 15 investigator sites were audited for the pivotal study WO20698/TOC4129g, as well as the 
Clinical  Research  Organization  (CRO),  Quintiles,  responsible  for  organizing  the  review  of  cardiac  data 
by  the  Cardiac  Review  Committee  (CRC).  Major  and  critical  finding(s)  involving  non-compliance  with 
GCP  were  observed  at  investigator  sites  and  also  at  the  CRO,  Quintiles.  However,  appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions were undertaken and these findings are not considered to have had 
any impact on the integrity of the data.  
Baseline data 
A summary of demography characteristics at baseline in the ITT analysis set is shown in the table 
below.

As  expected  for  patients  with  advanced  HER2+  BC,  the  study  population  was  mainly  represented  by 
women (only 2 men were enrolled in the Placebo arm), with a median age of 54 years (only 15.7% of 
patients  were  ≥  65  years  of  age),  and  therefore  the  majority  were  post-menopausal  (63.5%).  The 
majority of patients were White (59.4%). The second-largest race was Asians (32.3%). Approximately, 
one third of patients were enrolled in Europe (37.9%), one third in Asia (31.3%) and the rest in North 
(16.7%) – and South (14.1%) – America.

Only about a half of patients (46.5%) had received prior (neo-) adjuvant therapy whereas the rest of 
patients were untreated patients with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Among patients who 
received  prior  (neo-)adjuvant  therapy,  only  10%  had  received  trastuzumab  (47  patients  in  the 
pertuzumab arm and 41 patients in the placebo arm). The vast majority of the studied population was 
therefore  trastuzumab  naïve.  However,  less  than  10%  of  patients  usually  present  with  metastatic 
disease at the time of diagnosis in Western countries. The majority of patients had measurable disease 
(IRF-determined:  88.6%)  and  visceral  involvement  at  screening  (78%)  which  is  also  indicative  of  a 
relatively advanced disease stage.  
In general, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between treatment arms apart from the ECOG 
PS status where a slightly higher percentage of patients with PS 0 was found in the Ptz arm (68.2%) 
compared to the Placebo arm (61.1%). 
One  third  of  tumors  were  moderately  differentiated  adenocarcinomas  of  the  breast,  one  third  was 
poorly  differentiated  and  in  one  third  the  histological  tumour  grade  was  unknown.  About  90%  of 
tumours were HER2+ by IHC staining and > 99% of tumours was HER2+ by FISH. For the majority of 
patients  (>  90%)  the  HER2  status  was  only  tested  in  the  primary  tumour  specimen.  About  half  of 
tumours  were  ER/PgR  positive  which  is  in  line  with  previous  findings  in  HER2+  BC  populations.  The 
median disease-free interval was similar between treatment arms (29.0 months in the Placebo arm vs. 
31.0  months  in  the  Ptz  arm).  The  number  of  patients  with  locally  recurrent  disease  was  very  low  in 
both treatment arms (19 patients in total). 
Numbers analysed 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
Intent-to-Treat  Population:  All  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT) 
population.  The ITT population comprised all 808 randomized patients (406 Pla+T+D, 402 Ptz+T+D).  
Other  Analysis  Populations:  For  objective  response  and  time  to  response,  only  patients  with 
measurable  disease  at  baseline  were  included  in  the  analysis.  For  duration  of  response,  only 
responders  were  included  in  the  analysis.  For  time  to  symptom  progression  based  on  the  FACT-B 
questionnaire,  only  female  patients  were  included  in  the  analysis,  since  a  number  of  the  questions 
were applicable to female patients only. 
Safety  Analysis  Population  (SAP);  Patients  who  received  any  amount  of  any  component  of  study 
treatment  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  The  SAP  comprised  of  804  patients,  with 
two  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  receiving  no  study  medication  after  randomization.  Eight  of  the 
patients  randomized  to  receive  placebo  actually  received  at  least  one  dose  of  pertuzumab  during  the 
study.  For  the  purposes  of  the  safety  analysis,  these  patients  were  included  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm.  In 
addition,  one  patient  randomized  to  receive  pertuzumab  received  placebo  at  every  cycle,  and  is 
therefore  included  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  for  all  safety  analyses.  Thus,  overall,  the  SAP  comprised  397 
patients in the Pla+T+D arm and 407 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm.

Sensitivity analyses 
Six pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed that took account of the earliest PD data (IRF or 
investigator assessment), censored for use of next-line therapies, IRF-assessed PFS during treatment 
or treatment withdrawals due to toxicity or investigated the impact of missing assessments or included 
all early deaths as events. HRs in all of these analyses were very consistent with the primary analysis 
(HR from 0.58 to 0.66) thereby confirming the robustness of the primary result.

Perjeta

Rev04.12 
Page 71/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The robustness of the primary result was also tested by taking account of different prognostic factors 
in exploratory univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. None of the tested covariates had 
an impact on the treatment effect when adjusted for these covariates. Similarly, although ECOG status 
was  found  to  be  significantly  associated  with  PFS,  it  did  not  have  an  influence  on  the  adjusted 
treatment effect in the model.  
Subgroup analyses for PFS 
The pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated very consistent benefits in most subgroups.

Visceral disease status 
Results  of  univariate  analysis  underlined  a  covariate  effect  for  visceral  disease  status  versus  non-
visceral  status,  showing  a  non  adjusted  HR  on  IRF-PFS  of  0.63.  Moreover,  in  the  multivariate  Cox 
regression  analysis  for  IRF-PFS  using  a  stepwise  approach  visceral  disease  status  was  still  significant 
after  adjustment  (visceral  disease  status  vs.  non-visceral  HR=0.61).  An  exploratory  analysis  defined 
post-database  lock  was  performed  and  a  significant  treatment  by  covariate  interaction  was  observed 
only  for  visceral  disease  status  (p  =  0.0332).  Interaction  effect  is  supported  by  the  results  coming 
from a subgroup analysis showing a different treatment effect when patients were stratified according 
to visceral disease status (HR = 0.55 [0.45, 0.68] in visceral disease subgroup versus HR= 0.96 [0.61, 
1.52] in the non-visceral disease subgroup).

Ancillary analyses 
The  applicant  submitted  a  number  of  post-hoc  exploratory  investigations  in  order  to  further  address 
the potential importance of the ECOG status, the HER2 IHC status, docetaxel dose escalations, and of 
whether patients had previously been exposed to trastuzumab or not. 
Patients with HER2 IHC 2+ disease 
Patients with HER2 IHC 2+ disease (n=79) seemed to have a smaller benefit (HR = 0.90 [0.53, 1.54]), 
but the group was small (n=79) and the broad confidence intervals are noted. 78 of these 79 patients 
were FISH positive.  
Patients with prior exposure to trastuzumab in the (neo-) adjuvant setting: 
Only  88  patients  had  previously  received  trastuzumab.  Nevertheless,  a  similar  benefit  in  favor  of 
adding  Ptz  to  T+D  was  also  observed  in  this  small  sub-group  (HR=  0.62  (95  CI:  0.35;  1.07).  The 
observed result in the Placebo arm is also considered representative.

for  OS  for  patients  with  prior  (neo)adjuvant  trastuzumab  was  0.68  (95%  CI:  0.30,  1.55),  which  is  
consistent with the HR for the overall patient population  of 0.66 (95% CI; 0.52; 0.84).  
Patients with ECOG status 0 or 1+ 
An  exploratory  analysis  indicated  that  a  benefit  in  favour  of  Ptz+T+D  was  observed  both  in  patients 
with an ECOG status of 0 (n = 522; HR= 0.70 [0.55, 0.90]) and in patients with an ECOG status of 1+ 
(n = 286, HR= 0.55 [0.40, 0.74]) at baseline. 
Patients with docetaxel dose escalations (from 75 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2) 
Relatively few patients had the docetaxel dose uptitrated to 100 mg/2 (n= 109). The data indicate that 
the  higher  docetaxel  dose  did  not  have  a  major  impact  on  the  efficacy  results  as  HR  for  PFS  =  0.62 
(0.50; 0.76) in patients who were not dose escalated compared to HR= 0.65 (0.37, 1.13) in patients 
who received the highest docetaxel dose. 
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
PFS (INV-assessed) 
PFS based on INV assessment was in line with the result based on IRC assessment (HR for PFS (INV) 
= 0.65 (95% CI 0.54- 0.78, p< 0.0001), median PFS was 12.4 months in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 18.5 
months in the Ptz+T+D arm. 
The  Applicant  has  performed  an  updated  PFS  analysis  one  year  after  the  original,  primary  IRF-
determined  PFS  analysis.  At  the  time  of  the  updated  INV-based  PFS  analysis  (data  cut-off:  14  May 
2012)  68%  of  patients  had  had  a  PFS  event  (72.9%  in  the  Placebo  arm  and  63.9%  in  the  Ptz  arm). 
The  updated  HR  =  0.69  (95%  CI:  0.58,  0.81).  The  K-M  curves  demonstrated  an  early  and  clear 
separation.  The  median  PFS  was  12.4  months  in  the  Placebo  arm  compared with  18.7  months  in  the 
Ptz  arm.  Consistent  results  were  observed  in  the  subgroup  analyses.  Thus,  the  previously  observed 
PFS-benefit has been maintained and confirmed in this updated analysis.

Overall Survival (OS), First Analysis 
OS  data  was  not  mature  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off  for  the  primary  analysis  (13  May  2011).  The 
duration of follow-up was similar across treatment arms (19.3 months). In the Placebo arm 96 patients 
had died (23.6%) compared to 69 deaths (17.2%) in the Ptz arm. The median time to death had not 
been reached in any of the treatment arms. The HR for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47; 0.88, p = 0.0053) 
but  the  O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  boundary  was  not  met  (HR  ≤  0.603,  p  ≤  0.0012).  The  K-M  curves 
show  a  separation  in  favor  of  the  Ptz  arm  just  before  ten  months.  Of  note,  cross-over  between 
treatment arms was not allowed per protocol.

Updated OS results 
The  second  interim  analysis  of  OS  (data  cut-off  May  14th  2012)  was  based  on  events  one  year  after 
the data cut-off of the primary analysis, and included 102 additional deaths. At the time of this second 
analysis, 267 deaths had occurred, specifically 154 events (37.9%) in the placebo arm and 113 events 
(28.1%)  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  Results  from  the  second  interim  analysis  of  OS  (considered  as  the 
final OS analysis) showed a significant survival benefit for patients randomized to receive pertuzumab 
(stratified by prior treatment status and region), with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.84, p= 0.0008). 
Median survival was of 37.6 months in the placebo arm and was  still not reached in the pertuzumab 
arm.  There  was  a  sustained  survival  advantage  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  with  94%,  81%  and  66%  of 
patients surviving in the PTZ+T+D arm versus  89%, 69% and 50% in the Pl+T+D arm at 12, 24 and 
36 months, respectively.  
The results from  subgroup analyses were consistent with those obtained for the overall ITT population 
with the exception of the HR obtained for the subgroup of patients with non-visceral disease (HR 1.42) 
where the number of events was low (33 deaths ≈ 18.5%)

Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response 
A higher ORR was observed in the Ptz+T+D arm (80.2%) compared to the Pla+T+D arm (69.3%). The 
majority of responses in the Ptz arm were  PRs. The median duration of responses was also longer in 
the Ptz+T+D arm (87.6 weeks) than in the Pla+T+D arm (54.1 weeks).

Time to Symptom Progression (HRQoL) 
In  this  double-blinded  trial  the  pre-specified  analyses  do  not  indicate  a  difference  in  QoL  across 
treatment arms based on the FACT-B questionnaire.   
Biomarkers 
The potentially predictive value of a number of biomarkers (tumour/serum or whole blood based) was 
investigated. No specific hypotheses were predefined. The cut-point between “high” and ”low” levels of 
expression  was  for  practical  purposes  set  at  the  median  level  of  each  individual  biomarker.                     
No predictive biomarkers were identified that could be used to select patients with a better or poorer 
response to Ptz+T+D. All investigated subgroups seemed to benefit from the Ptz+T+D combination.

Immunogenicity 
The  incidence  of  positive  ATA  results  for  the  pivotal  study  WO20698/TOC4129  was  reported  using  a 
conservative  approach  by  including  all  patients  with  any  post-baseline  positive  result.  With  this 
approach, antibodies to pertuzumab were detected in 6.2% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm and 2.8% 
of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm.

Supportive study(ies) 
Study WO20697 (NEOSPHERE) 
Study  WO20697  was  a  randomized,  open-label  study  investigating  4  different  regimens  in 
the neoadjuvant setting. 417 treatment-naïve patients with HER2+, locally advanced, inflammatory or 
early stage breast cancer (EBC) of more than 2 cm in diameter were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
treatment  with  either  T+D  (Regimen  A),  PtZ+T+D  (Regimen  B),  Ptz+T  (Regimen  C)  or  Ptz+D 
(Regimen  D).  The  4th  treatment  arm  (Ptz+D)  was  introduced  by  amendment  after  the  enrolment  of 
just  29  patients  in  the  trial.  Doses  given  were  in  line  with  the  doses  used  in  the  pivotal  trial  (T:  8 
mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg, D: 75 mg/m2 at cycle 1, then increased to 100mg/m2 if there was 
no limiting toxicity, P: 840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg). The study regimens were administered for 
4  cycles  3qw  prior  to  surgery  (neoadjuvant  therapy).  After  surgery  patients  in  arms  A,  B  and  D 
received 3 cycles of FEC whereas patients in arm C received 4 cycles of D followed by 3 cycles of FEC. 
All  patients  received  T  for  a  year  in  total  (adjuvant  therapy).  The  primary  endpoint  was  pathological 
complete response (pCR) rate in the breast.. Secondary endpoints were clinical response rate, time to 
clinical response, rate of breast conserving surgery, evaluation of biomarkers, DFS and PFS.  
Baseline  characteristics  were  overall  well-balanced  between  treatment  arms.  Approximately  60%  of 
patients  in  all  treatment  arms  had  operable  EBC.  Overall,  few  patients  withdrew  prematurely  from 
treatment; the highest number was noted in arm C (Ptz+T) and was caused by insufficient response. 
Almost  all  patients  received  all  4  cycles  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  and  doses  received  were  similar 
across  treatment  arms.  For  Ptz,  93-95%  of  patients  across  treatment  arms  received  all  4  cycles  of 
study  treatment.  The  planned  total  dose  was  2100  mg  and  2048-2060  mg  was  received.  For  T,  93-
98% of patients received all 4 cycles and the mean total dose received was balanced across treatment 
arms (1710-1785 mg). For D, 95-99% of patients completed all 4 cycles and the median dose received 
was 576-600 mg across treatment arms.  
The  results  of  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  demonstrate  very  similar  pCR  rates  in  the 
treatment arms A (T+D: 29%) and D (Ptz+D: 24.0%) so although activity was shown with Ptz without 
T, it was clearly better to add Ptz to T+D (Ptz+T+D: 45.8%). This justifies the lack of a Ptz+D arm in 
the pivotal study. The activity of Ptz+T (without D) was inferior to the other regimens (Ptz+T: 16.8%). 
DFS results are not mature.  
Study BO17929 
Study BO17929 was a Simon’s two-stage, Phase II, single-arm study exploring the efficacy and safety 
of Ptz and T in patients with HER2+ MBC who had received ≤ 3 chemotherapy lines before study entry 
and  who  had  lately  progressed  on  T-based  therapy.  The  last  T  dose  should  have  been  received  ≤  9 
weeks  prior  to  study  day  1.  Cohort  1  included  24  patients  in  whom  Ptz  was  added  to  T  that  was 
continued  (Ptz+T).  Predefined  criteria  for  continuation  were  met  at  an  interim  analysis  so  that  42 
Perjeta

additional patients were enrolled into Cohort 2. Cohort 3 included 29 patients in whom T was stopped 
at study entry and treatment with Ptz was initiated as single-agent. If patients in Cohort 3 experienced 
PD, T could be added to Ptz (17 patients). Standard doses of T were used (loading dose of 4 mg/kg, 
then  2  mg/kg  if  weekly  administration,  loading  dose  of  8  mg/kg,  then  6  mg/kg  in  3  weekly 
administration).  
At the time of the primary analysis, the median number of T+Ptz cycles received was 9 (range 1-26). 
The median total dose of Ptz received was 4.200 mg (range 840 – 11.340 mg). The median total dose 
of T received was 3897 mg (range 423 – 11.907 mg). Overall, baseline characteristics were balanced 
between  treatment  arms.  Slightly  more  patients  in  Cohort  3  had  a  PS  of  1,  but  this  is  of  less 
importance since treatment arms were not directly compared. All patients had MBC.  
When combining Cohorts  1+2, the ORR to Ptz+T was 24.2% despite the fact that these patients had 
recently  progressed  on  a  T-containing  regimen.  There  were  12  patients  with  PR,  and  4  patients  with 
CR. 26% of patients had SD for at least 6 months so the CBR was 50% which is relatively impressive 
in  this  advanced  disease  setting.  Patients  in  Cohort  3  who  had  failed  on  a  T-containing  regimen  and 
stopped T at study entry had minor benefit of treatment with Ptz alone (ORR 3.4% (1 case of PR)). 2 
patients  experienced  SD  so  the  CBR  was  10.3%  (3  patients).  In  contrast,  a  better  response  was 
actually seen when re-introducing T at the time of PD as the ORR was 17.6% (3 patients) and the CBR 
35.3%  in  this  subgroup  of  cohort  3.  This  indicates  that  added  activity  is  observed  when  Ptz+T  are 
administered together.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  efficacy  in  the  present  submission  is  based  on  the  pivotal  study,  WO20698/TOC4129g 
(CLEOPATRA), a well-designed and well-conducted phase III trial. This trial was a randomized, double-
blind,  placebo  controlled  study  of  Ptz+T+D  compared  to  Pla+T+D  in  patients  with  untreated  HER2-
positive locally recurrent, unresectable or MBC. 
Overall,  the  clinical  development  program  of  Ptz  has  been  designed  in  accordance  with 
recommendations  in  the  “Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man” 
(CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.3/Corr. 2). According to this guideline (and to the new draft Guideline) PFS is 
an  acceptable  primary  endpoint  and  a  prolonged  PFS  as  such  is  considered  to  represent  a  clinical 
benefit  to  the  patient  per  se.  However,  the  estimated  treatment  effect  on  OS  as  secondary  endpoint 
should  be  precise  enough  to  rule  out  a  detrimental  effect  on  OS,  in  most  cases  by  showing  trends 
towards a favourable outcome. In principle, a single pivotal trial is considered acceptable according to 
the  guideline  “Points  to  consider  on  application  with  1.  Meta-analyses;  2.  One  pivotal  study” 
(CPMP/EWP/2330/99)  provided  that  a  statistically  compelling  and  clinical  relevant  benefit  as  well  as 
internal and external validity can be demonstrated and that the B/R-ratio is considered positive.   
EMA  scientific  advice  was  sought  in  2007  on  the  design  of  the  phase  III  trial  WO20698/TOC4129g 
(CLEOPATRA) and has overall been adhered to. 
The  pivotal  study  included  patients  with  HER2+  disease  (centrally  confirmation  of  HER2  status 
according to standard criteria: 3+ by IHC or amplification ratio ≥ 2.0 by FISH) who had not previously 
received  systemic  treatment  for  advanced  disease  (1st  line),  however,  prior  hormonal  treatment  for 
MBC  was  allowed.  Prior  (neo)adjuvant  treatment  with  trastuzumab  and/or  taxanes  was  allowed 
provided  that  the  disease-free  interval  between  end  of  adjuvant  therapy  and  recurrence  was  ≥  12 
months  thereby  excluding  patients  who  would  be  less  likely  to  respond  to  rechallenge  with 
trastuzumab/taxanes  as  previously  recommended  by  the  CHMP.  Patients  with  a)  a  previous  high

decreases in LVEF < 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy or e) other major cardiac conditions were 
excluded  as  a  safety  measure  as  HER2-targeting  agents  are  known  to  be  cardiotoxic.  The  study 
population  is  considered  acceptable  and  representative  of  HER2+  patients  with  MBC  who  could  be 
considered candidates for further HER-targeted therapy.  
The  biological  rationale  for  combining  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  in  order  to  obtain  a 
complementary  inhibition  of  the  HER2  axis  has  been  well  justified.  The  lack  of  a  Ptz+D  arm  in  the 
pivotal  trial  was  discussed  during  the  scientific  advice  procedure.  The  applicant  has  argued  that  non-
clinical data as well as data from the supportive studies, in particular study WO20697, clearly indicate 
that  although  both  antibodies  have  activity  as  single-agents,  the  combination  regimen  is  more  active 
than  either  agent  alone.  Therefore,  it  was  found  unethical  to  include  a  Ptz+D  only  arm.  This 
argumentation is accepted.  
According  to  current  standards,  a  first-line  metastatic  regimen  consisting  of  T  (traztuzumab)  and  a 
taxane seems appropriate for patients with an interval of more than 12 months between completion of 
an adjuvant T-containing regimen and relapse. T (loading dose 8 mg/kg) and repeated every 3 weeks 
(maintenance  dose:  6  mg/kg)  combined  with  D  100  mg  /m2  every  3  weeks  is  considered  an 
acceptable  standard  1st  line  regimen.  When  designing  the  pivotal  study  it  was  decided  to  lower  the 
initial  D  dose  to  75  mg/m2  in  both  treatment  arms  as  this  dose  is  often  used  in  clinical  practice  in 
order to reduce the risk of toxicity (particularly the risk of (febrile) neutropenia). However, given that 
100 mg/m2 is the approved dose for D in combination with T in the EU and considering the previous 
advice obtained from the CHMP, the applicant introduced the option to dose escalate D to 100 mg/mg 
after the first dose based on individual patient tolerability which is endorsed.  
PFS  is  considered  an  acceptable  primary  endpoint.  The  proposed  secondary  endpoints,  including  OS, 
ORR,  QoL  are  also  standard  and  in  accordance  with  the  current  and  draft  Guideline  regarding 
development  of  anticancer  drugs.  Evaluation  of  potential  biomarkers  has  also  been  included  as  a 
secondary  endpoint  which  is  endorsed.  The  study  was  double-blind.  No  evident  reasons  for 
compromising  the  study  blinding  have  been  identified.  The  primary  analysis  of  PFS  was  based  on  an 
Independent  Review  Facility  (IRF)  -derived  assessment  to  further  reduce  the  risk  of  bias.  As 
recommended, a simple stratified (block) randomization was used and strata were kept at a minimum 
(prior  treatment  status  and  geographical  region).  Symmetrical  and  regular  assessment  schedules 
(every  9  weeks)  were  also  applied  for  the  two  treatment  arms  in  order  to  avoid  bias.  Tumour 
assessments were continued until IRF-confirmation of progression in order to avoid lack of follow-up in 
case progression was only determined by investigators but not confirmed by the IRC.  
As  recommended  by  the  CHMP  the  sample  size  was  increased  from  600  to  800  patients  in  order  to 
provide  more  statistically  compelling  results.  A  HR  of  0.75  (a  33%  improvement  in  median  PFS)  in 
favor  of  the  P+T+D  arm  was  assumed.  In  order  to  have  80%  power  to  detect  a  benefit  of  this 
magnitude  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  5%,  381  IRF-assessed  PFS  events  would  be  required. 
The basic assumptions are considered appropriate. An interim analysis of OS was planned at the time 
of the primary analysis of PFS. The pre-specified stopping boundary for the interim analysis was set at 
HR ≤ 0.603, p ≤ 0.0012. Standard statistical tests and a fixed-sequence testing hierarchy were used. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The first patient was enrolled in the pivotal CLEOPATRA study on 12 February 2008. The date for data 
cut-off  for  the  primary  PFS  analysis  was  on  13  May  2011.  In  total,  1196 patients  were  screened  and 
808  patients  (N)  were  enrolled  and  randomized  to  one  of  two  treatment  arms:  Pla+T+D  (n=406)  or

Ptz+T+D  (n=  402).  Patients  were  enrolled  from  204  centres  in  25  countries.  All  patients  have  been 
adequately accounted for. 
Overall, demographics were representative of the proposed target population. 
Disease  characteristics:  The  number  of  patients  with  locally  recurrent  disease  was  very  low  in  both 
treatment arms (19 patients in total). From a biological point of view there is no reason to support a 
different  response  to  Ptz  in  patients  with  locally  inoperable  disease  and  in  patients  with  MBC. 
Moreover, the clinical approach is very similar for locally advanced inoperable BC to that for metastatic 
disease.  A  statement  to  reflect  the  very  limited  data  available  in  patients  with  unresectable  locally 
recurrent disease has been mentioned in the SmPC section 5.1. 
The median disease-free interval was 29.0 months in the Placebo arm vs. 31.0 months in the Ptz arm 
and prior therapies were also well-balanced across treatment arms. About one quarter of patients had 
received  hormone  therapy  as  adjuvant  or  1st  line  treatment  for  metastatic  disease  (allowed  by 
protocol). In general, patients with ER+ /HER2 + tumours have lower response rates and shorter time 
to progression when treated with endocrine therapy. Studies indicate that HER2 and ER interact (cross 
talk).  Therefore,  T  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  is  considered  standard  first-line  therapy  in 
patients  with  ER+/HER2+  tumours  unless  patients  can’t  tolerate  or  do  not  wish  treatment  with 
chemotherapy  (Reference:  DBCG  guidelines).  The  number  of  patients  who  received  hormone  therapy 
as 1st line therapy for MBC was limited (n= 49) and similarly distributed across treatment arms (29 in 
the Placebo arm and 20 in the Ptz arm). It seems that these patients had a more indolent disease as 
expressed by a long time from diagnosis to metastasis (median 45.16 months). 
The  main  concern  has  been  that  only  about  half  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  had  received  prior 
(neo-)  adjuvant  therapy  which  is  a  much  lower  percentage  than  expected  from  clinical  practice  in 
Western  countries.  Of  particular  concern  was  the  fact  that  only  about  10%  of  patients  (10.1%  (41 
patients)  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  vs.  11.7%  (47  patients)  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm)  had  received  prior 
trastuzumab  (T)  in  the  (neo-)  adjuvant  setting  so  the  vast  majority  of  patients  were  therefore 
trastuzumab-naïve.  Overall,  the  patient  population  of  the  pivotal  trial  appeared  to  have  been 
undertreated compared to the standard of care of today.  According to current international standards 
an adjuvant T-containing regimen should be offered to all women with HER2+, node-positive BC or to 
women with HER2+ node-negative tumours > 1 cm in size. Even for patients with smaller tumours T 
may  be  considered due  to  the  generally  increased  risk  of  recurrence  in  patients  with  HER2+  BC.  The 
applicant has explained the relatively low usage of adjuvant T with reference to the unavailability of T 
in some regions of the world, a generally lower usage of trastuzumab in the EU in the beginning of the 
recruitment period (February 2008 – July 2010) compared to today and to the requirement of a one-
year  disease-free  interval  at  minimum  between  adjuvant  therapy  and  relapse.  These  are  valid 
arguments. Reassurance on the interpretation of the study results derives from the fact that patients 
pretreated  with  (neo)adjuvant  trastuzumab  were  well  balanced  between  the  two  study  arms. 
Therefore, the superiority of the combination of two anti-HER2 antibodies is not questioned. However, 
the  estimated  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  in  patients  already  exposed  to  T  might  differ  from 
what  has  been  observed.  As  expected,  the  majority  of  the  88  patients  previously  exposed  to 
trastuzumab  came  from  the  EU  or  North  America  (72).  The  demography  of  these  patients  was 
comparable to demographics of the entire European population as well as the ITT population. Further 
reassurance derives from an exploratory post-hoc analysis showing that the efficacy of T+D+Ptz (IRF-
assessed  PFS)  was  comparable  between  the  subgroup  of  patients  pre-treated  with  trastuzumab  (n= 
88, HR = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.35; 1.07)) and the overall study population (N= 808, HR= 0.62 (95% CI: 
0.51; 0.75). These results have been confirmed in the updated analysis presented (cut-off date 14 May 
2012).  Similarly,  the  updated  OS  results  showed  very  similar  outcomes  in  the  subgroup  of  patients 
pretreated with trastuzumab (HR= 0.68 (95% CI: 0.30; 1.55)) and in the ITT population (HR = 0.66

(95% CI: 0.52, 0.84)). With all the limitations of a post-hoc exploratory analysis in mind, these data 
support the efficacy of pertuzumab also in the EU target patient population. In conclusion, the benefit 
of  pertuzumab,  both  in  the  overall  patient  population  as  well  as  in  patients  pre-treated  with 
trastuzumab,  is  considered  clinically  relevant  and  sufficiently  supported  by  the  available  evidence.  In 
support, study BO17929 documented the activity of Ptz in patients pre-treated with trastuzumab in the 
metastatic  setting.  The  results  of  the  ongoing  studies  PHEREXA  (2nd  line  MBC)  and  PERUSE  (1st  line 
MBC)  will  be  able  to  further  confirm  the  effect  size  associated  with  Ptz  in  patients  pre-treated  with 
trastuzumab and should be submitted (Annex II conditions to the marketing authorisation).      
Primary  endpoint:  At  the  time  of  data  cut-off  for  the  primary  IRF-based  PFS  efficacy  analysis  242 
patients in the Placebo arm had an event (59.6%) compared to only 191 patients (47.5%) in the Ptz-
arm. The K-M curves demonstrated a clear, consistent and early separation already at the time of the 
first tumour assessment at 9 weeks. The HR for IRF-assessed PFS was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51; 0.75, p < 
0.0001) (stratified analysis) in favour of the Ptz-containing arm. The median PFS was 18.5 months in 
the Ptz arm compared to 12.4 months in the Placebo arm, resulting in an absolute gain of 6.1 months 
in  median  PFS  in  patients  treated  with  both  Ptz+T+D.  The  result  of  the  unstratified  analysis  (HR  = 
0.63, p < 0.0001) was in support of the stratified IRF-PFS result. Six pre-specified sensitivity analyses 
were performed that took account of the earliest PD data (IRF or investigator assessment), censored 
for  use  of  next-line  therapies,  IRF-assessed  PFS  during  treatment  or  treatment  withdrawals  due  to 
toxicity or investigated the impact of missing assessments or included all early deaths as events. HRs 
in  all  of  these  analyses  were  very  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  (HR  from  0.58  to  0.66).  For 
completeness, the result of the “worst-case” sensitivity analysis (including early withdrawals as events) 
also supported the result of the primary analysis confirming its robustness.   
The robustness of the primary result was also tested by taking account of different prognostic factors 
in exploratory univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. None of the tested covariates had 
an impact on the treatment effect when adjusted for these covariates. Similarly, although ECOG status 
was  found  to  be  significantly  associated  with  PFS,  it  did  not  have  an  influence  on  the  adjusted 
treatment effect in the model (data not shown). 
The pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits in most subgroups, specifically 
also in patients who had received prior (neo-) adjuvant therapy, in elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age 
and in patients with HR+  tumours. As expected, larger confidence intervals were observed in smaller 
populations.  The  estimate  for  European  patients  was  slightly  higher  than  for  the  overall  population 
(HR=0.72 (0.53; 0.97)) but still the upper CI was below 1. The very elderly patients (≥75 years) did 
not appear to derive statistical significant benefit from pertuzumab, although this finding is likely to be 
due  to  the  limited  number  of  very  elderly  patients  (n=19).  The  limited  knowledge  of  the  benefit  of 
pertuzumab in the patient population ≥75 years old has been reflected in the SmPC.  
It has been noted that the subgroup analysis detected very limited efficacy in patient with non visceral 
disease  (n=178)  (HR=0.96  (0.61;  1.52)).  This  is  somewhat  unexpected  from  a  mechanistic  point  of 
view  as  HER2  blockade  is  also  known  to  be  efficacious  in  earlier  disease  stages.  The  relatively  wide 
confidence intervals reveal that the estimate is not very precise in this subpopulation. It is agreed that 
the  particular  non-visceral  subgroup  characteristics  (smaller  sample  size  and  a  biological  behaviour 
resulting  in  a  lower  event  rate)  may  have  resulted  in  the  large  variability  of  the  point  estimate  and 
probability to capture a true treatment effect  
In light of these considerations, a restriction of indication of pertuzumab treatment to the subgroup of 
patients with visceral disease status is not advisable. However, a Forest plot of the subgroup analysis 
results for PFS has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The  applicant  has  performed  a  number  of  post-hoc  exploratory  investigations  in  order  to  further 
address  the  potential  importance  of  the  ECOG  status,  the  HER2  IHC  status  and  docetaxel  dose 
escalations.   
• 
Patients  with  HER2  IHC  2+  disease  (n=79)  seemed  to  have  a  smaller  benefit  (HR  =  0.90 
[0.53,  1.54]).  It  is  agreed  that  the  limited  number  of  enrolled  patients  with  IHC2+  tumours 
(n=79)  hampers  firm  conclusions  to  be  drawn  but  the  results  of  secondary  endpoints  and 
across studies do not indicate a smaller benefit in this subgroup of patients. 
•  An  exploratory  analysis  indicated  that  a  benefit  in  favor  of  Ptz+T+D  was  observed  both  in 
patients  with  an  ECOG  status  of  0  (n  =  522;  HR=  0.70  [0.55,  0.90])  and  in  patients  with  an 
ECOG  status  of  1+  (n  =  286,  HR=  0.55  [0.40,  0.74])  at  baseline.  The  Ptz  arm  included  a 
slightly  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  PS  0  (68.2%)  compared  to  the  Placebo  arm 
(61.1%).  Based  on  the  results  above,  this  small  imbalance  is  unlikely  to  have  biased  the 
results in the overall population significantly.     
•  Relatively  few  patients  had  the  docetaxel  dose  uptitrated  to  100  mg/m2  (n=  109).  Dose 
escalation  of  docetaxel  did  not  have  a  major  impact  on  the  efficacy  results  as  HR  for  PFS  = 
0.62  (0.50;  0.76)  in  patients  receiving  D  75mg/m2  compared  to  HR=  0.65  (0.37,  1.13)  in 
patients who received the highest docetaxel dose (100 mg/m2). The applicant has provided an 
elaborate  review  of  clinical  practice  in  Europe  regarding  used  dosages  of  docetaxel  in  MBC. 
Since  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  had  the  opportunity  to  dose-escalate  docetaxel  to  100 
mg/m2, the overall exposure to docetaxel was similar in the two treatment arms and efficacy 
results similar whether patients received the high or low dose docetaxel, it is agreed that there 
is no indication that patients in the Placebo-containing arm were under-dosed. 
Secondary  endpoints:  PFS  based  on  INV  assessment  was  in  line  with  the  result  based  on  IRC 
assessment (HR for PFS (INV) = 0.65 (95% CI 0.54- 0.78, p< 0.0001), median PFS was 12.4 months 
in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  vs.  18.5  months  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm.  In  general,  there  was  good  concordance 
between  IRC  and  INV  assessment.  The  agreement  on  occurrence  of  a  PFS  event  was  86%  in  the 
Pla+T+D arm and 85% in the Ptz+T+D arm. When also taking the timing into account, agreement of a 
PFS event occurring within 30 days of each other was 67% in both arms.    
The  Applicant  has  performed  an  updated  PFS  analysis  one  year  after  the  original,  primary  IRF-
determined  PFS  analysis.  At  the  time  of  the  updated  INV-based  PFS  analysis  (data  cut-off:  14  May 
2012)  68%  of  patients  had  had  a  PFS  event  (72.9%  in  the  Placebo  arm  and  63.9%  in  the  Ptz  arm). 
The  updated  HR  =  0.69  (95%  CI:  0.58,  0.81).  The  K-M  curves  demonstrated  an  early  and  clear 
separation.  The  median  PFS  was  12.4  months  in  the  Placebo  arm  compared with  18.7  months  in  the 
Ptz  arm.  Consistent  results  were  observed  in  the  subgroup  analyses.  Thus,  the  previously  observed 
PFS-benefit has been maintained and confirmed in this updated analysis 
The  study  was  fully  powered  to  assess  OS  at  80%  power.  However,  OS  data  was  not  mature  at  the 
time  of  the  primary  data  cut-off  where  only  43%  of  the  number  of  events  required  for  the  final  OS 
analysis had occurred. The duration of follow-up was similar across treatment arms (19.3 months). In 
the  Placebo  arm  96  patients  had  died  (23.6%)  compared  to  69  deaths  (17.2%)  in  the  Ptz  arm.  The 
median  time  to  death  had  not  been  reached  in  any  of  the  treatment  arms.  The  HR  for  OS  was  0.64 
(95%  CI:  0.47;  0.88,  p  =  0.0053)  but  the  O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  boundary  was  not  met  (HR  ≤ 
0.603,  p  ≤  0.0012).  The  K-M  curves  show  a  separation  in  favour  of  the  Ptz  arm  just  before  ten 
months. Of note, cross-over between treatment arms was not allowed per protocol.  
The  second  interim  analysis  of  OS  (data  cut-off  May  13th  2012)  collected  events  one  year  after  the 
data  cut-off  of  the  primary  analysis,  by  adding  102  deaths.  At  the  time  of  this  second  analysis,  267 
deaths  had  occurred,  specifically  154  events  (37.9%)  in  the  placebo  arm  and  113  events  (28.1%)  in 
Perjeta

the  pertuzumab  arm.  Results  from  the  second  and  final  OS  analysis  showed  a  significant  survival 
benefit  for  patients  randomized  to  receive  pertuzumab  (stratified  by  prior  treatment  status  and 
region):  HR  of  0.66  (95%  CI:  0.52;  0.84,  p<  0.0008).  Median  survival  was  of  37.6  months  in  the 
placebo  arm  and  was  not  still  reached  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  Survival  rates  showed  a  sustained 
survival advantage in the pertuzumab arm 0.94, 0.81 and 0.66 for the PTZ+T+D arm and 0.89, 0.69 
and 0.50 in the Pl+T+D arm at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively. 
The  results  from  a  subgroup  analysis  were  consistent  with  those  obtained  for  the  overall  ITT 
population.  Only  the  HR  obtained  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  non-visceral  disease  showed  a 
negative trend (HR 1.42; 95% CI: 0.71; 2.84) but the number of events in this subgroup was low (33 
deaths ≈ 18.5%) as expressed by the wide confidence intervals. The particular non-visceral subgroup 
characteristics  (smaller  sample  size  and  a  biological  behaviour  resulting  in  a  lower  event  rate)  may 
have  resulted  in  the  large  variability  of  the  point  estimate  and  the  probability  to  capture  a  true 
treatment effect) in this subgroup. 
More  patients  in  the  Placebo  arm  (64%)  received  subsequent  lines  of  therapy  or  surgical  procedures 
compared  the  Ptz-containing  arm  (56%).  This  imbalance  may  confound  later  OS  results.  The  most 
frequently  used  2nd  line  therapy  was  capecitabine  in  both  treatment  arms.  A  substantial  number  of 
patients also continued T upon progression or were switched to lapatinib, a dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor. Finally, the experimental drug trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was also received by 
10% of patients in both study arms. 
A higher ORR was observed in the Ptz+T+D arm (80.2%) compared to the Pla+T+D arm (69.3%). The 
majority of responses in the Ptz arm were  PRs. The median duration of responses was also longer in 
the Ptz arm (87.6 weeks) than in the Placebo arm (54.1 weeks). A subset of patients was classified as 
non responders (19.8% in the pertuzumab arm and 30.7 in the control arm) and a minority (5.5% in 
the pertuzumab arm and 4.2% in the control arm) obtained a CR. The assessment of the biomarkers 
panel  in  specific  sub-populations  (e.g.  patients  with  complete  response  vs.  patients  with  quick 
progression) was considered in defining the biologic characteristics of these two different subsets. 
In  this  double-blinded  trial  the  pre-specified  analyses  did  not  indicate  a  difference  in  QoL  across 
treatment arms based on the FACT-B questionnaire.   
The potentially predictive value of a number of biomarkers (tumour/serum or whole blood based) was 
investigated.  No  predictive  biomarkers  were  identified  that  could  be  used  to  select  patients  with  a 
better or poorer response to Ptz+T+D. All investigated subgroups seemed to benefit from the Ptz+T+D 
combination. As expected, the number of samples varied per biomarker, but overall the availability of 
samples  was  relatively  high  (58-99.8%).  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  biomarker  expression 
between  primary  and  metastatic  tumour  samples.  Therefore,  only  a  total  of  24  pairs  (primary 
tumour/metastatic  tumour)  were  available  for  this  analysis  and  all  markers  could  not  be  tested  in  all 
samples (due to lack of tumour tissue or for technical reasons). Only possible mechanisms involved in 
intrinsic resistance have been investigated. Biomarkers included molecules known to confer resistance 
to  HER2  (e.g.  PI3K  mutation  status,  loss  of  PTEN).  No  predictive  markers  were  identified.  It  is 
recommended  that  results  regarding  acquired  resistance  mechanisms  are  submitted  when  available 
(projected Q4 2012).  
Immunogenicity: Patients in the pivotal trial CLEOPATRA were tested at multiple time-points for anti-
therapeutic  antibodies  (ATA)  to  Perjeta.  Approximately  2.8%  (11/386  patients)  of  Perjeta-treated 
patients and 6.2% (23/372 patients) of placebo-treated patients tested positive for ATAs. Of these 34 
patients,  none  experienced  severe  (NCI-CTCAE  Grade  >3)  infusion  or  hypersensitivity  reactions 
(anaphylaxis) that were clearly related to ATA. However, Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions associated 
with  detectable  ATAs  occurred  in  2  of  366  Perjeta-treated  patients  (0.5%)  in  phase  I  and  II  studies. 
Perjeta

There  are  currently  insufficient  data  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  ATA  on  the  efficacy  of  Perjeta  in 
combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel;  a  potential  loss  of  efficacy  based  on  ATA  in  individual 
patients cannot be ruled out.  
Supportive  studies:  The applicant has submitted supportive data from 2 Phase II studies that were 
both  performed  in  different  study  populations  than  proposed  in  the  indication  but  the  results  confirm 
the added activity observed when combining Ptz and T.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of Ptz to T+D in the first-line treatment of locally advanced or MBC demonstrated a highly 
statistically significant and clinically relevant gain in IRF-based PFS (+ 6 months in median PFS, HR = 
= 0.62 [95% CI: 0.51; 0.75]). The primary result was shown to be robust and internally consistent in 
most  subgroup  analyses.  It  was  supported  by  most  results  of  secondary  endpoints  and  it  was 
maintained  and  confirmed  in  the  updated  INV-based  PFS  analysis.  An  exploratory  subgroup  analysis 
indicates consistent results in the small subgroup of patients pre-treated with T confirming the added 
benefit of the more complete HER2 blockade despite prior treatment status.  
Importantly,  results  from  the  second  interim  OS  analysis  after  33%  of  patients  had  died,  showed  a 
significant survival benefit for patients randomized to receive pertuzumab (stratified by prior treatment 
status and region): HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.84, p= 0.0008). Median survival was 37.6 months in 
the  placebo  arm  and  was  not  still  reached  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  The  updated  OS  results 
demonstrate  very  similar  outcomes  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  pre-treated  with  trastuzumab  (HR= 
0.68  (95%  CI:  0.30;  1.55)).  Only  the  HR  obtained  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  non-visceral 
disease  showed  a  negative  trend  (HR  1.42;  95%  CI:  0.71;  2.84)  but  the  number  of  events  in  this 
subgroup was low (33 deaths ≈ 18.5%) as expressed by the wide confidence intervals. The particular 
non-visceral  subgroup  characteristics  (smaller  sample  size  and  a  biological  behaviour  resulting  in  a 
lower  event  rate)  may  have  affected  the  large  variability  of  the  point  estimate  and  the  probability  to 
capture a true treatment effect (low power) in this subgroup. 
In conclusion, the observed benefit of adding pertuzumab to a standard regimen is considered clinically 
relevant and sufficiently supported by the available evidence both in the overall patient population as 
well as in patients pre-treated with trastuzumab.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
• 
The results of the ongoing studies PHEREXA (2nd line MBC) and PERUSE (1st line MBC) should 
be submitted to confirm the efficacy of Ptz in patients pre-treated with trastuzumab (Annex II 
obligations). 
It is recommended that results regarding acquired resistance mechanisms are submitted when 
available.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  evaluation  of  safety  is  based  on  data  from  the  pivotal  WO20698/TOC4129g  study,  the  two  key 
supporting  studies  and  14  other  studies.  These  studies  provide  safety  data  on  patients  exposed  to  the 
planned  treatment  regimen  pertuzumab  +  trastuzumab  +  docetaxel  (Ptz+T+D),  as  well  as  safety  data

for  patients  exposed  to  pertuzumab  in  combination  with  trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  alone,  and 
pertuzumab with other anti-cancer agents. 
Patient exposure 
Overall,  a  total  of  1412  patients  received  at  least  one  infusion  of  pertuzumab  in  the  14  studies 
evaluated. The median number of cycles received in “all Pertuzumab treated patients” was 4 (range 1-
62) with a median exposure duration of 3 months (range 1-43). 
In the pivotal study at the data cutoff for 2nd the second interim analysis of overall survival, 
the median number of placebo/pertuzumab cycles was 15 (range 1-62) vs. 24 (range 1-66). 
The  median  total  dose  of  placebo  was  6720  mg  and  the  median  total  dose  of  pertuzumab 
received  was  10500  mg  (range  840-28140).  The  median  exposure  duration  of 
placebo/pertuzumab was 11.4 months (range 1-46) vs. 17.4 months (range 1-47).    A total 
of 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 26% of patients in the pertuzumab arm were yet 
to discontinue from treatment.   
The  long  term  safety  data  in  the  proposed  indication  is  considered  sufficient  as  in  the  pivotal  study 
24.3% of the patients were exposed to pertuzumab for >6 - <=12 months and 57.2% of the patients 
were  exposed  for  more  than  12  months  and  up  to  more  than  2  years,  at  the  time  of  the  primary 
analysis. 
Exposure  to  docetaxel  was  overall  similar  across  treatment  arms  (median  of  eight  cycles  in  both 
treatment  arms,  the  median  dose  per  cycle  was  125 mg  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  vs.  123 mg  in  the 
Ptz+T+D arm). 
Adverse events  
Common adverse events 
In the pivotal study almost all patients experienced at least one AE, 98.5% and 99.8 % in the placebo 
arm and pertuzumab arms, respectively. The majority of AE’s were considered treatment-related. The 
most  common  (>25%)  AEs  in  the  pivotal  study  were  alopecia  (60.5%  in  the  placebo  arm/  60.9%  in 
the  pertuzumab  arm),  diarrhoea 
(46.3%/66.8%),  neutropenia 
(49.6%/52.8%),  nausea 
(41.6%/42.3%),  fatigue  (36.8%/37.6%),  rash  (24.2%/33.7%),  asthenia  (30.2%/26.0%),  decreased 
appetite 
(26.4%/29.2%),  peripheral  oedema 
(30.0%/23.1%)  and  mucosal 
inflammation 
19.9%/27.8%). AE’s (any grade) observed with a higher incidence (at least 5 percentage points) in the 
pertuzumab  arm  were  diarrhoea  (46.3%  in  the  placebo  arm,  66.8%  in  the  pertuzumab  arm),  rash 
(24.2%  in  the  placebo  arm,  33.7  %  in  the  pertuzumab  arm),  mucosal  inflammation  (19.9%  in  the 
placebo arm, 27.8 % in the pertuzumab arm), febrile neutropenia (7.6 % in the placebo arm, 13.8 % 
in  the  pertuzumab  arm)  and  dry  skin  (4.3  %  in  the  placebo  arm,  10.6%  in  the  pertuzumab  arm). 
These events were mainly grade 1 or 2 and occurred less frequently after discontinuation of docetaxel. 
AE’s  observed  with  a  lower  incidence  (at  least  5  percentage  points)  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  were 
edema peripheral (30.0% in the placebo arm, 23.1% in the pertuzumab arm) and constipation (24.9% 
in  the  placebo  arm,  15.0%  in  the  pertuzumab  arm).  In  addition,left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction 
LVSD  (any  grade)  was  observed  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  arm  (8.3%)  compared  to  the 
pertuzumab arm (4.4%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Severe adverse events 
In the pivotal study no difference in experienced grade 3-4 events was observed between the placebo 
arm  and  the  pertuzumab  arms  (72.0%  and  73.5%,  respectively).  The  most  common  grade  3-4 
adverse  events  reported  were  neutropenia  (45.8  %  in  the  placebo  arm,  48.9  %  in  the  pertuzumab 
arm),  febrile  neutropenia  (7.3  %  in  the  placebo  arm,  13.0  %  in  the  pertuzumab  arm),  leukopenia 
(14.6 % in the placebo arm, 12.3 % in the pertuzumab arm) and diarrhoea (5.0 % in the placebo arm, 
7.9  %  in  the  pertuzumab  arm).  So  it  was  mainly  the  rates  of  grade  3+  febrile  neutropenia  and 
diarrhoea  that  were  higher  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  compared to the  control  arm.  LVSD  of  grade  3 or 
higher  was  reported  less  frequently  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  (1.2%)  compared  to  the  placebo  arm 
(2.8%). 
Deaths 
Overall in the pivotal study 94 patients (23.7%) died in the placebo arm and 69 patients (17%) died in 
the pertuzumab arm. The majority of deaths were due to PD (n=81 in the placebo arm and n= 57 in 
the pertuzumab arm),  however, 13 deaths in the placebo arm and 12 deaths in the pertuzumab arm 
were due to other causes.

Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, in the pivotal trial 34.4% of patients in the Ptz-T-D arm reported a SAE compared to 26.2% in 
the Pla+T+D arm. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia (11.3% in the Ptz arm vs. 5.0% in 
the Placebo arm), and infections (10.8% in the Ptz arm vs. 7.3% in the Placebo arm).

Adverse events of Special Interest 
Cardiac safety data 
In  the  pivotal  trial  symptomatic  Left  Ventricular  Systolic  Dysfunction  (LVSD)  was  reported  for  11 
patients (7 in the Placebo arm (1.8%) vs. 4 (1%) in the Ptz arm) by investigators. These cases were 
reported as cardiac failure SAEs and were all considered treatment-related. The CRC identified 4 cases 
(1%) in each treatment arm. All 4 cases in the Placebo arm were categorized as NYHA class II events 
whereas  3  events  in  the  Ptz  arm  were  categorized  as  NYHA  class  III-IV  events.  These  cases  led  to 
treatment discontinuation and supportive therapy. 
Significant  LVEF  (defined  as  a  decline  of  at  least  10%  points  from  baseline  to  an  absolute  value  of  , 
50%) declines other than symptomatic CHF were observed in 5.5% of patients in the Placebo arm vs. 
3.2% in the Ptz arm.

In  the  pivotal  study  QT  prolongation  was  reported  as  AE  in  2.0%  of  patients  in  the  Placebo  arm  vs. 
1.3% in the Ptz-containing arm. 
Infusion-Associated Reactions 
In the pivotal study, relatively few patients experienced an event during a placebo/Ptz infusion (5.0% 
in  the  placebo  arm  vs.  8.8%  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm).  Most  of  these  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity.  Events  observed  on  Day  1  in  Cycle  1  were  of  particular  interest,  as  this  was  the  only  day 
when Ptz or Placebo was administered without T or D. On this day, 3.9% receiving Ptz experienced an 
AE during the infusion compared to 2.0% in the Placebo arm. The most frequent events reported in the 
Ptz  arm  were  nausea,  pyrexia,  diarrhea,  chills,  fatigue,  headache,  asthenia,  hypersensitivity  and 
vomiting.

Leucopenia 
Leucopenic  events  (which  include  neutropenia  envents  and  febrile  neutropenia  events)  were  reported 
in 58.2% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 62.4% in the Ptz+T+D arm in the pivotal trial. Most of 
these  events  were  ≥  grade  3  (53.1%  and  58.2%,  respectively).  Of  most  interest  is  the  incidence  of 
febrile neutropenia that was slightly higher in the Ptz-containing arm (13.8%) compared to the Placebo 
arm (7.6%).

Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea was more commonly reported in patients treated with Ptz+T+D (66.8%) than with Pla+T+D 
(46.3%) in the pivotal trial. It was also potentiated by treatment with docetaxel since only a minority 
of patients (<10%) experienced diarrhoea after Cycle 6.

Laboratory findings 
Most  patients  had  normal  laboratory  values.  As  expected,  the  most  common  Grade  3+  laboratory 
values  at  any  time  in  the  pivotal  trial  were  Grade  3+  neutropenia  with  a  balanced  frequency  across 
treatment arms (86.6% in the Placebo arm vs. 86.0% in the Ptz arm). In general, shifts from baseline 
were  also  comparable  between  treatment  arms  for  hematologic  parameters.  For  biochemistry 
parameters  grade  3-4  shifts  occurred  most  frequently  for  uric  acid  (as  an  indicator  of  increased  cell 
turnover)  and  liver  function  tests,  potassium,  sodium,  magnesium  and  fasting  glucose.  Minor 
differences were observed between treatment arms.   
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In  the  pivotal  trial  there  were  very  few  patients  of  age  ≥  75  years  (19  in  total,  5  in  the  Ptz  arm)  so 
data in this subgroup is difficult to interpret. There were 126 patients of age ≥ 65 years. The incidence 
of  neutropenic  events  was  slightly  higher  in  patients  <  65  years  of  age  and  the  incidence  of  febrile 
neutropenia  was  highest  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  in  the  younger  age  group.  In  contrast,  the  elderly 
patients  experienced  slightly  more  diarrhea  but  the  absolute  difference  between  young  and  elderly 
patients was < 10%.  The incidence of cardiac events was overall comparable across age groups. 
Gender 
The  pivotal  study  only  included  2  male  patients  and  the  proposed  target  population  will  mainly  be 
represented by women. 
Race 
Asian patients (who represented approximately 30% of the pivotal study population) experienced more 
neutropenia, and particularly more febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm (26%) compared to other 
races, most probably due to a higher docetaxel exposure in Asians.  
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Perjeta 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev04.12 
Page 103/123 
 
 
 
 
 
The  safety  of  pertuzumab  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  Patients  with 
inadequate liver function were excluded from Study WO20698/TOC4129g (defined as total bilirubin < 
ULN, AST or ALT< 2.5 ULN). 
Patients with reduced kidney function 
The safety of pertuzumab has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. No dedicated renal 
impairment  study  has  been  conducted  for  pertuzumab.  Study  WO20698/TOC4129g  enrolled  patients 
with serum creatinine levels ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L. 
Immunological events 
The incidence of clinically relevant safety sequelae related to unwanted immunogenicity of pertuzumab 
was low and in line with what may be expected for a humanized monoclonal antibody. It is agreed with 
the  Applicant  that  the  occurrence  of  ATA  per  se  do  not  necessarily  warrant  discontinuation  of 
pertuzumab, since patients may, with appropriate management, still benefit from pertuzumab.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety studies related to drug-drug interactions were submitted as no drug-drug interactions have 
been indentified for pertuzumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
When  excluding  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  docetaxel  alone,  relatively  few  patients  in  the 
pivotal trial stopped study medication due to AEs and the proportion was similar across treatment arms 
(5.3% in the Placebo arm vs. 6.1% in the Ptz arm). In both treatment arms the most common reason 
for discontinuing was left ventricular dysfunction (2.0% in the Placebo arm and 1.5% in the Ptz arm). 
Other  reasons  reported  in  the  Ptz  arm  were  hypersensitivity  reactions,  diarrhea  and  rash  reported  in 
0.5% of patients, respectively.

The number of cycle delays was also similar across treatment arms (6.3% in the Placebo arm vs. 5.8% 
in  the  Ptz  arm).  In  contrast,  dose  interruptions  or  modifications  were  slightly  more  frequent  in  the 
Ptz+T+D arm (60.0%) compared to the Pla+T+D arm (53.1%). The most common AEs leading to dose 
modifications  in  the  Ptz-containing  arm  were  as  expected  febrile  neutropenia,  hypersensitivity  and

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Pivotal trial 
Overall,  standard  reporting  methods  for  safety  parameters  have  been  used.  However,  additional 
cardiac safety measures were instituted, including separate collection of LVEF data and a cardiac event 
evaluation by a Cardiac Review Committee (CRC) which is endorsed based on the known risk of cardio 
toxicity  associated  with  other  HER2  targeting  agents.  The  exposure  to  pertuzumab  is  considered 
sufficient to allow a representative safety evaluation. 
Common  AEs  associated  with  docetaxel  are  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  fluid  retention,  dyspnoea, 
neutropenia, infections, myalgia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and allergic reactions.  Common AEs 
associated  with  trastuzumab  are  asthenia,  fatigue,  flu-like  symptoms,  headache,  dyspnoea,  infusion-
related  reactions,  nausea,  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  febrile  neutropenia,  cardiotoxicity  (Ejection 
Fraction decreased), arthralgia and myalgia.

In the pivotal study almost all patients experienced at least one AE, 98.5% and 99.8 % in the placebo 
and pertuzumab arms, respectively. The majority of AE’s were considered treatment-related.                     
Common AEs in the pivotal study (incidence >25%) were alopecia (60.5% in the placebo arm, 60.9% 
in 
the  pertuzumab  arm),  diarrhoea  (46.3%/66.8%),  neutropenia  (49.6%/52.8%),  nausea 
(41.6%/42.3%),  fatigue  (36.8%/37.6%),  rash  (24.2%/33.7%),  asthenia  (30.2%/26.0%),  decreased 
appetite 
(26.4%/29.2%),  peripheral  oedema 
(30.0%/23.1%)  and  mucosal 
inflammation 
19.9%/27.8%).  So  when  pertuzumab  was  added  to  trastuzumab  +  docetaxel  the  safety  profile  was 
generally  not  changing,  however,  more  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucosal  inflammation,  dry  skin  and  (febrile) 
neutropenia were seen. Importantly, no increase in LVSD was observed. 
Overall, no difference in grade 3-4 events was observed between the placebo arm and the pertuzumab 
arms (72.0% and 73.5%, respectively). It was mainly the rates of febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea of 
grade  3+  that  were  higher  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  compared to the  control  arm.  LVSD  of  grade  3  or 
higher  was  reported  les  frequently  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  (1.2%)  compared  to  the  placebo  arm 
(2.8%). 
Deaths: In the pivotal trial 23.7% of patients died in the placebo arm vs. 17% in the pertuzumab arm. 
The  majority  of  patients  died  due  to  PD  (20.4%  and  14.0%,  respectively)  and  most  deaths  occurred 
more  than  42  days  after  last  treatment.  AEs  resulting  in  death  were  observed  in  2.5%  of  patients  in 
the  placebo  arm  and  in  2.0%  of  patients  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  No  accumulation  of  specific  causes 
was noted. In particular, no deaths were attributed to heart failure. There were 6 deaths in the Placebo 
arm  and  5  deaths  in  the  Ptz  arm  considered  treatment-related  by  Investigator.  As  expected,  febrile 
neutropenia was the most common fatal treatment-related AE in the Ptz arm (3 cases). Of note, there 
was  however  also  two  patients  in  the  Placebo  arm  who  died  of  treatment-related  sepsis/febrile 
neutropenia. 
SAEs: Overall, a higher number of patients in the Ptz arm reported a SAE (34.4%) compared to 26.2% 
in the Pla+T+D arm. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia and infections. The incidence of 
febrile neutropenia almost doubled in the Ptz-treated patients (11.3% in the Ptz arm vs. 5.0% in the 
Placebo arm), whereas only a modest increase in the incidence of infections was actually noted (10.8% 
in  the  Ptz  arm  vs.  7.3%  in  the  Placebo  arm).  The  incidence  of  all  other  SAEs  was  <  5%  in  both 
treatment  arms.  SAEs  that  considered  related  to  treatment  by  Investigators  could  be  related  to  all 
components of the regimen. Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 25.1% of patients in the Ptz arm 
vs. 17.9% in the Placebo arm. The difference  was  mainly due to a larger incidence of SAEs of  febrile 
neutropenia in the Ptz arm (11.3% vs. 4.8% in the Placebo arm).  
The  Applicant  has  provided  an  additional  6  months  of  safety  data  (new  safety  cut-off  date:  7 
November  2012,  previous  safety  cut-off  dates  were  13  May  2011  and  14  May  2012  respectively). 
Reassuringly, the updated safety profile is very consistent to what was reported in the MAA.  
Summary of safety update (data cut-off, 7 November 2012): The incidence of SAEs was still higher in 
the  Ptz  arm  (35.6%)  compared  with  the  Placebo  arm  (28.0%),  especially  because  of  more  cases  of 
febrile  neutropenia  in  the  Ptz  arm.  In  contrast,  more  patients  had  died  in  the  Placebo  arm  (28.7%) 
compared  with  the  Ptz  arm  (22.4%).  Most  patients  died  because  of  PD.  Since  the  first  safety  report 
(data cut-off,13 May 2011), two more deaths from other causes than PD were reported (one unrelated 
case  of  myocardial  infarction  in  the  Placebo  arm  and  one  unevaluable  death  in  the  Ptz  arm).  Two 
additional patients in the Placebo arm had Grade ≥ 3 LVSD and one additional patient in the Ptz arm 
had  developed  CHF.  More  common  AEs  associated  with  Ptz  were  still  diarrhea,  rash,  mucosal 
inflammation, febrile neutropenia and dry skin. Pruritus had also been added.  The severity of events 
was overall similar to what was previously reported. No new safety events were identified.

Events of special interest 
A number of events of special interest were pre-defined by the applicant based on the mechanism of 
action of pertuzumab.  
Cardiac  safety:  HER  family  members  play  a  crucial  role  in  normal  cardiac  development  thus  cardiac 
safety in patients treated with the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab is an important issue 
(Portera  CC  et  al.,  CCR  2008).  In  order  to  limit  the  possible  occurrence  of  cardiac  toxicity,  the 
enrolment criteria for all the pertuzumab studies were aimed to select patients having a good cardiac 
function  (LVEF  cut-off  value  at  baseline:  50-55%)  and  stable  LVEF  values  (a  decline  of  LVEF  value 
below  50%  during  prior  or  after  Trastuzumab  was  not  accepted).  Moreover,  several  measures  were 
used  to  monitor  cardiac  safety  including  independent  cardiac  event  evaluation  by  a  Cardiac  Review 
Committee (CRC). 
In  the  pivotal  study,  the  addition  of  pertuzumab  to  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  did  not  seem  to 
increase  the  incidence  of  cardiac  toxicity.  The  number  of  patients  who  had  cardiac  AEs  of  any  type 
reported  during  the  treatment  period  was  roughly  comparable  between  the  two  arms  (16.4%  of 
patients in the Pla+T+D arm, and 14.5% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm). As expected, left ventricular 
systolic  dysfunction  (LVDS)  was  the  most  common  cardiac  AE  (reported  more  frequently  in  the 
Pla+T+D  arm  (8.3%)  than  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  (4.4%).  Symptomatic  LVSD  was  reported  for  11 
patients  by  investigators  (7  in  the  Placebo  arm  vs.  4  in  the  Ptz  arm).  These  cases  were  reported  as 
cardiac  failure  SAEs  and  were  all  considered  treatment-related.  The  CRC  identified  4  cases  (1%)  in 
each treatment arm. All 4 cases in the Placebo arm were categorized as NYHA class II events whereas 
3  events  in  the  Ptz  arm  were  categorized  as  NYHA  class  III-IV  events.  These  cases  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation  and  supportive  therapy.  The  ventricular  dysfunction  was  reversible  as  the  majority  of 
cases had resolved at the time of data-cut off. Significant LFEV declines other than symptomatic CHF 
(defined  as  a  decline  of  at  least  10%  points  from  baseline  to  an  absolute  value  of  <50%)  were 
observed  in  5.5%  of  patients  in  the  Placebo  arm  vs.  3.2%  in  the  Ptz  arm.  The  analysis  of  patient 
characteristics in the pivotal study showed that the median LVEF was 65.0% (range 50-88%) and that 
patients with a lower baseline LVEF in the range of 50-55% only represented 7.8% of the total study 
population why a selection bias was suspected. As only a minority of the patients had been exposed to 
trastuzumab  and/or  anthracyclines  in  the  adjuvant  setting,  there  were  concerns  that  the  risk  of 
cardiotoxicity  had  been  underestimated.  The  baseline  LVEF  data  did  not  differ  from  what  has  been 
observed  in  other  1st  line  studies  in  MBC.  Patient  characteristics  such  as  baseline  LVEF  values,  age, 
smoking  status,  prior  radiotherapy  and  prior  anthracycline  therapy  were  well  balanced  across 
treatment arms. 
The  cardiac  safety  profile  of  Ptz  has  been  described  in  details  and  updated.  No  differences  were 
observed  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  terms  of  incidence  of  cardiac  AEs.  Left  ventricular 
dysfunction,  was the most common cardiac AE (Pla+T+D: 8.6% and PTZ+T+D: 5.2%). Risk factors of 
cardiotoxicity have been identified (mainly prior anthracycline therapy and prior radiotherapy). Based 
on  data  from  the  pivotal  trial,  the  incidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  was  5.6%  in  the  Placebo  arm 
compared  with  0.8%  in  the  Ptz  arm  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  had  never  received  prior 
anthracyclines  or  trastuzumab  (n=477).  Prior  anthracycline  therapy  (n  =  239)  resulted  in  a  higher 
incidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  (mainly  LVEF  declines)  in  both  treatment  arms,  the  increase  was 
however  slightly  more  marked  in  the  Ptz  arm  (Placebo:  8.9%,  Ptz:  12.1%)  which  could  be  a  chance 
finding.  Prior  trastuzumab  exposure  did  not  seem  to  increase  the  risk  of  cardiotoxicity.  The  cardiac 
dysfunction  was  reversible  in  the  majority  of  patients.  The  updated  cardiac  safety  review  did  not 
identify new concerns.

Relevant information about risk factors and exclusion criteria in the pivotal trial has been provided in 
the SmPC as for trastuzumab. Cardiac disorders have been included in the RMP. Of note, oncologists 
are experienced with the surveillance and management of these adverse events.  
Infusion-Associated Reactions (IARs): The applicant has used 3 “time-windows” for registration of IARs 
in  the  pivotal  trial  instead  of  investigator-assessed  causality  or  event  terms.  Relatively  few  patients 
experienced an event during a placebo/Ptz infusion (5.0% in the Placebo arm vs. 8.8% in the Ptz+T+D 
arm). Most of these events were mild or moderate in severity. Events observed on Day in Cycle 1 were 
of particular interest, as this was the only day when Ptz or Placebo was administered without T or D. 
On  this  day,  3.9%  receiving  Ptz  experienced  an  AE  during  the  infusion  compared  to  2.0%  in  the 
Placebo  arm..  The  applicant  has  identified  patients  with  a  history  of  asthma,  eczema  or  hay  fever  to 
have a slightly higher risk of developing Infusion-Associated Reactions.  
Anaphylaxis  or  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  for  9.1%  of  patients  in  the  Placebo  arm  vs. 
10.8%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz  arm.  These  events  were  severe  in  2.5%  and  2.0%  of  patients, 
respectively.  Only  1.5%  of  patients  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  vs.  1.0%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm 
discontinued  study  medication  due  to  anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity  reactions,  indicating  that  most  of 
these  reactions  could  be  handled  by  interrupting  or  slowing  the  infusion  or  by  reducing  the  dose  of 
docetaxel. No potential risk factors were identified.  
The incidence of leucopenic events was only slightly higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (62.4%) compared to   
the Pla+T+D arm (58.2%). Most of these events were ≥ grade 3 (58.2% and 53.1%, respectively). Of 
most interest is the incidence of febrile neutropenia that was also slightly higher in the Ptz-containing 
arm (13.8%) compared to the Placebo arm (7.6%). These frequencies are however not high enough to 
recommend prophylactic G-CSF usage (FN risk ≥ 20%). Similarly, the incidence of (febrile) leucopenic 
infections was also slightly higher in the Ptz arm than in the placebo arm [(3.4%) 12.5% vs. (0.8%) 
9.8%]. The median time to the most severe leucopenic event was 29 days in both treatment arms. The 
incidence  of  leucopenic  events  was  clearly  associated  with  the  administration  of  docetaxel  as 
leucopenic events were almost not observed in treatment arms without administration of docetaxel in 
the supportive studies (0.9% in the Ptz+T arm of study WO20697 and 0% in study BO17929 (Ptz+T)).            
Asian race was identified as a risk factor for leucopenia.  
Exacerbation of chemotherapy/docetaxel-associated neutropenia was identified as an important risk to 
be monitored in the post marketing surveillance. 
A  wording  advising  monitoring  of  patients  for  complications  of  neutropenia  in  case  of  treatment-
induced myelosuppression  together with reference to docetaxel dose modifications has been included 
in the SmPC section 4.2. The reported data do not support a clear role of pertuzumab in affecting the 
docetaxel nadir and the recovery from neutropenia 
Diarrhea was more commonly reported in patients treated with Ptz (66.8%) than with Placebo (46.3%). 
This was expected as diarrhea is thought to be an off-target intestinal effect caused by the inhibition of 
HER1/HER2 and HER2/HER heterodimers. Although diarrhea episodes also lasted longer in Ptz-treated 
patients (median duration of longest episode 17 days compared to 8 days in the control arm), most of 
these  events  were  mild  or  modest  in  severity  (the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  events  was  7.9%  in  the 
Ptz+T+D arm vs. 5.0% in the Pla+T+D arm) and few patients actually discontinued study medication 
due to diarrhea so it was overall considered manageable. Many patients experienced diarrhea early in 
the  course  of  treatment.  Risk  factors  were  Asian  race,  patients  with  a  history  of  bowel  disease  and 
patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy.  
Rash  is  another  expected  off-target  effect  involving  HER1  (EGFR).  The  incidence  of  rash  increased 
when  adding  Ptz  to  T+D  (45.2%  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm)  compared  to  the  Pla+T+D  arm  (36.0%).

However, severe events (≥ grade 3) were rare (2.7% in the Ptz arm vs. 1.3% in the Placebo arm) and 
few patients discontinued treatment due to rash that often occurred early in the course of treatment. 
The supportive studies confirm that rash was also seen in Ptz+T arms (18.5% in study WO20697 and 
31.3% in study BO17929) as well as in Ptz single-agent studies (23.8%).  
Similarly, more patients in the Ptz-arm experienced mucositis (48.6%) vs. 37.0% in the Placebo arm. 
The  incidence  of  patients  experiencing  Grade  3+  events  was  generally  low  (2.9%  in  the  Ptz  arm  vs. 
1.8%  in  the  Placebo  arm).  Docetaxel  seemed  to  be  a  contributing  factor  since  patients  in  Ptz  single-
agent  studies  and  in  Ptz+T  arms  of  the  supportive  studies  had  a  much  lower  incidence  of  mucositis. 
With  regard  to  the  potential  relationship  between  neutropenia  and  mucositis,  the  Applicant  provided 
exhaustive  information.  The  reported  data  confirm  the  onset  of  mucositis  whenever  the  nadir  of 
neutrophil  count  is  expected.  The  simultaneous  occurrence  of  neutropenia  and  mucositis  is  clinically 
expected. 
The  incidence  of  all  grade  hepatic  disorders  was  balanced  between  treatment  arms  (10.1%  in  the 
Placebo arm vs. 9.6% in the Ptz arm). Grade ≥ 3 events were rare (1.3% in the Placebo arm vs. 1.7% 
in  the  Ptz  arm).  The  most  common  event  was  increased  ALAT.  No  potential  risk  factors  for  hepatic 
disorders were identified. Liver metastases were not a risk factor according to the applicant but of note, 
only patients with a preserved liver function were included in the pivotal study. No studies have been 
performed in patients with impaired liver function.  
Age: In the pivotal trial there were very few patients of age ≥ 75 years (19 in total, 5 in the Ptz arm) 
why  data  in  this  subgroup  is  difficult  to  interpret.  There  were  126  patients  of  age  ≥  65  years.  The 
incidence of neutropenic events was slightly higher in patients < 65 years of age and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia was highest in the Ptz+T+D arm of the younger age group. In contrast, the elderly 
patients  experienced  slightly  more  diarrhea  but  the  absolute  difference  between  young  and  elderly 
patients was < 10%.  The incidence of cardiac events was overall comparable across age groups.  
Race: Asian patients (who represented approximately 30% of the study population) experienced more 
neutropenia, and particularly more febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm (26%) compared to other 
races, most likely due to a higher docetaxel exposure in Asians. This information has been included in 
the SmPC.  
Discontinuations/Dose  interruptions/Delays:  The  proportion  of  patients  stopping  docetaxel  treatment 
due to toxicity was similar across treatment arms (23.2% of patients in the Placebo arm vs. 23.6% of 
patients in the Ptz arm). The most common reasons were edema, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy. 
The number of patients who discontinued due to neutropenia was also similar (7 patients in each arm), 
but in addition, 4 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm stopped docetaxel due to febrile neutropenia vs. none 
in the Placebo arm. When excluding events leading to discontinuation of docetaxel alone, relatively few 
patients  stopped  study  medication  due  to  AEs  and  the  proportion  was  similar  across  treatment  arms 
(5.3%  in  the  Placebo  arm  vs.  6.1%  in  the  Ptz  arm).  This  indicates  that  although  added  toxicity  was 
observed  in  the  Ptz-containing  arm,  the  tolerability  of  the  triple  regimen  was  overall  acceptable.  In 
both  treatment  arms  the  most  common  reason  for  discontinuing  treatment  was  left  ventricular 
dysfunction  (2.0%  in  the  Placebo  arm  and  1.5%  in  the  Ptz  arm).  In  the  Ptz  arm  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  diarrhea  and  rash  were  other  reasons  reported  in  0.5%  of  patients,  respectively.  The 
number of cycle delays was also similar across treatment arms (6.3% in the Placebo arm vs. 5.8% in 
the  Ptz  arm).  In  contrast,  dose  interruptions  or  modifications  were  slightly  more  frequent  in  the 
Ptz+T+D arm (60.0%) compared to the Pla+T+D arm (53.1%). The most common AEs leading to dose 
modifications  in  the  Ptz-containing  arm  were  febrile  neutropenia,  hypersensitivity  and  diarrhoea  as 
expected.  
Supportive studies

It  is  of  interest  that  patients  who  received  Ptz  +  T  (but  without  D)  in  study  WO20697  in  general 
experienced considerably fewer AEs compared to the patients in the other 3 docetaxel containing arms 
of  the  study.  This  was  also  observed  in  the  other  supportive  study  BO17929  in  which  no  concurrent 
chemotherapy was given (Ptz +/- T). In addition, a very low frequency of leucopenia was observed in 
the  supportive  studies  without  docetaxel-containing  regimens  and  in  the  single-agent  pertuzumab 
studies indicating that the chemotherapy component (docetaxel) is likely to be the main cause of this 
AE in the pivotal study. The same is evident for alopecia. Similarly, few grade 3-4 AEs were observed 
for the combination of Ptz+T compared to those arms which included docetaxel. In the key supporting 
studies 3 deaths were observed in total. In the neo-adjuvant study WO20697, only 16.8% of patients 
reported a SAE (probably due the shorter treatment duration), however the most commonly reported 
SAE  was  febrile  neutropenia  in  all  arms  containing  docetaxel  (T+D:  7.5%,  Ptz+T+D:  8.4%,  Ptz+T: 
0%, P+D: 12.8%). Only one SAE of cardiac failure was observed in the Ptz + T arm. Significant LVEF 
declines were also observed at low numbers but with the highest incidence in the Ptz+T+D arm (T+D: 
0.9%, Ptz+T+D: 2.8%, Ptz-T: 0%, Ptz-D: 1.1%). In the other supportive study BO17929 in advanced 
MBC,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  14.5%,  but  no  SAEs  were  reported  for  the  Ptz+T  combination.  The 
incidence  of  significant  LVEF  declines  was  higher  (7.2%)  in  the  BO17929  study  that  in  the  WO20697 
study which probably reflects the fact that all patients had been pre-treated in the BO17929 study with 
T and > 70% had received anthracyclines. There were no reports of CHF SAEs in this study. 
Single-agent studies 
Common  AEs  (>20%)  associated  with  pertuzumab  as  single  agent  were  diarrhoea  (57.3%),  fatigue 
(31.6%), nausea (30.8%), vomiting (22.3%) and decreased appetite (21.2%). Diarrhoea (6.5%) was 
the most common Grade 3+ AE. There were no SAE reports of neutropenia/febrile neutropenia. Deaths 
during study treatment (n=30, 7.8%) were mainly due to PD (7.0%). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  of  a  pertuzumab  (Perjeta)  has  been  evaluated  in  more  than  1,400  patients  either  in  the 
pivotal trial CLEOPATRA or in phase I and II trials conducted in patients with various malignancies and 
predominantly treated with Perjeta in combination with other antineoplastic agents.  
407 patients received at least one dose of Perjeta in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The 
most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (>50%) were diarrhoea, alopecia and neutropenia. The 
most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3-4 ADRs (> 10%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia 
and  leucopenia,  and  the  most  common  serious  adverse  events  were  febrile  neutropenia,  neutropenia 
and diarrhoea. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 1.2% of patients in the Perjeta-treated group and 
1.5%  of  patients  in  the  placebo-treated  group  and  were  mainly  due  to  febrile  neutropenia  and/or 
infection. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred at a frequency of <10% in the pivotal trial CLEOPATRA 
(4.4%  in  the  Perjeta-treated  group  and  8.3%  in  the  placebo-treated  group,  including  symptomatic 
LVSD in 1.2% in the Perjeta-treated group and 2.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group). 
The  safety  of  Perjeta  in  phase  I  and  II  studies  was  generally  consistent  with  that  observed  in  the 
CLEOPATRA trial, though the incidence and most common ADRs varied depending on whether Perjeta 
was administered as monotherapy or with concomitant anti-neoplastic agents. 
Therefore the CHMP included the following statements in the SmPC: 
•  Decreases  in  LVEF  have  been  reported  with  medicinal  products  that  block  HER2  activity, 
including Perjeta. Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the 
Perjeta

chest  area  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  LVEF  declines.  In  the  pivotal  trial  CLEOPATRA,  Perjeta  in 
combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  was  not  associated  with  a  greater  incidence  of 
symptomatic  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  (LVSD)  or  LVEF  declines  compared  with 
placebo and trastuzumab and docetaxel. 
• 
Perjeta  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with:a  pre-treatment  LVEF  value  of  ≤50%;  a  prior 
history  of  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF);  LVEF  declines  to  <50%  during  prior  trastuzumab 
adjuvant therapy; or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled 
hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a 
cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to >360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. 
•  Assess  LVEF  prior  to  initiation  of  Perjeta  and  every  three  cycles  during  treatment  to  ensure 
that LVEF is within the institution’s normal limits. If LVEF is <40% or 40-45% associated with 
≥10% points below the pretreatment value, Perjeta and trastuzumab should be withheld and a 
repeat  LVEF  assessment  performed  within  approximately  3  weeks.  If  the  LVEF  has  not 
improved,  or  has  declined  further,  discontinuation  of  Perjeta  and  trastuzumab  should  be 
strongly considered, unless the benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the 
risks.  
• 
Perjeta  has  been  associated  with  infusion  and  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Close  observation  of 
the patient during and for 60 minutes after the first infusion and during and for 30-60 minutes 
after  subsequent  infusions  is  recommended  following  the  administration  of  Perjeta.  If  an 
infusion  reaction  occurs,  the  infusion  should  be  slowed  down  or  interrupted  and  appropriate 
medical  therapies  should  be  administered.  Patients  should  be  evaluated  and  carefully 
monitored  until  complete  resolution  of  signs  and  symptoms.  Perjeta  must  be  permanently 
discontinued  in  case  of  NCI-CTCAE  Grade  4  hypersensitivity  reactions  (anaphylaxis), 
bronchospasm or acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
• 
Patients  treated  with  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  are  at  increased  risk  of  febrile 
neutropenia  compared  with  patients  treated  with  placebo,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel, 
especially  during  the  first  3  cycles  of  treatment.  As  nadir  neutrophil  counts  were  similar  in 
Perjeta-treated  and  placebo-treated  patients,  the  higher  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in 
Perjeta-treated  patients  may  be  associated  with  the  higher  incidence  of  mucositis  and 
diarrhoea  in  these  patients.  Symptomatic  treatment  for  mucositis  and  diarrhoea  should  be 
considered.  In  the  pivotal  trial,  CLEOPATRA,  no  events  of  febrile  neutropenia  were  reported 
after cessation of docetaxel. 
• 
In  the  pivotal  trial  CLEOPATRA,  ADRs  were  reported  less  frequently  after  discontinuation  of 
docetaxel  treatment.  After  discontinuation  of  docetaxel,  all  ADRs  in  the  Perjeta  and 
trastuzumab  treated  group  occurred  in  <10%  of  patients  with  the  exception  of  diarrhoea 
(19.1%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (12.8%),  rash  (11.7%),  headache  (11.4%)  and 
fatigue (11.1%).

Routine activities: 
Perjeta and trastuzumab should 
be withheld for at least 3 weeks 
for any of the following: 
symptoms and signs suggestive of 
congestive heart failure (Perjeta 
should be discontinued if 
symptomatic heart failure is 
confirmed) 
a drop in left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) to less than 40%  
a LVEF of 40%-45% associated 
with a fall of  ≥ 10% points below 
pre-treatment values. 
Perjeta and trastuzumab may be 
resumed if the LVEF has 
recovered to > 45% or 40-45% 
associated with < 10% points 
below pretreatment value. 
If after a repeat assessment 
within approximately 3 weeks, the 
LVEF has not improved, or has 
declined further, discontinuation 
of Perjeta and trastuzumab should 
be strongly considered, unless the 
benefits for the individual patient 
are deemed to outweigh the risks.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
HER2 positive breast cancer (BC) represents approximately 20% of all breast cancers. They are known 
to have a more aggressive phenotype, a higher recurrence rate and a poor prognosis. Trastuzumab (T) 
has  revolutionized  the  treatment  of  HER2+  BC.  It  is  now  the  standard  of  care  and  is  used  in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  in  the  (neo-)  adjuvant  and  metastatic  setting  for  patients  with 
intervals  of  more  than  12  months  between  completion  of  adjuvant  T  and  relapse.  Despite  the 
improvements  made,  patients  with  advanced  HER2+disease  will  eventually  progress  on  trastuzumab-
containing  regimens.  There  is  a  growing  body  of  evidence  supporting  continued  HER2  blockade  upon 
disease progression, so that patients are often switched to other trastuzumab- or lapatinib- containing 
regimens. More agents are currently under development.  
Pertuzumab (Ptz) represents the first drug in a new class of targeted therapy called ”HER2 dimerisation 
inhibitors”.  It  is  a  recombinant,  humanized,  IgG  mAb  which  also  targets  HER2,  but  Ptz  binds  to  a 
different  epitope  (domain  II)  than  T  (domain  IV)  and  prevents  dimerisation  of  HER2  with  other 
members  of  the  HER  family  (HER1  (=EGFR),  HER3  and  HER4).  These  dimers  (homodimers  or 
heterodimers)  are  responsible  for  signal  transduction  that  is  involved  in  the  survival,  growth  and 
division of BC cells. Thereby, it is believed that Ptz will result in a more complete inhibition of the HER2 
axis when combined with T (dual HER2 blockade).   
The  pivotal  study  in  this  submission  is  the  Phase  III  study  WO20698/TOC4129g  (CLEOPATRA),  a  
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  phase  III  study  of  Ptz+T+D  compared  to  Pla+T+D  in 
patients with untreated HER2-positive locally recurrent, unresectable or MBC.

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  the  addition  of  Ptz  to  T+D  resulted  in  a  HR  of  0.62  for  IRF-assessed 
PFS  (95%  CI:  0.51;  0.75,  p  <  0.0001)  (stratified  analysis)  in  favour  of  the  Ptz-containing  arm.  The 
median PFS was 18.5 months in the Ptz arm compared to 12.4 months in the Placebo arm. 
The result of the primary analysis was supported by the results of secondary endpoints. PFS based on 
INV assessment was in line with the result based on IRC assessment (HR for PFS (INV) = 0.65 (95% 
CI 0.54- 0.78, p< 0.0001)), median PFS was 12.4 months in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 18.5 months in the 
Ptz+T+D  arm).  The  PFS-benefit  has  been  maintained  and  confirmed  in  an  updated  INV-based  PFS 
analysis one year after the original, primary, IRF-based PFS analysis. At the time of the updated INV-
based PFS analysis (data  cut-off: 14 May 2012) 68% of patients had had a  PFS event  (72.9% in the 
Placebo  arm  and  63.9%  in  the  Ptz  arm).  Updated  HR  for  PFS  (INV)  =  0.69  (95%  CI:  0.58,  0.81).              
The K-M curves demonstrated an early and clear separation. The median PFS was 12.4 months in the 
Placebo arm compared with 18.7 months in the Ptz arm. Consistent results were also observed in the 
subgroup analyses. 
At the time of the primary PFS analysis 96 patients had died in the Placebo arm (23.6%) compared to 
69  deaths  (17.2%)  in  the  Ptz  arm.  The  median  time  to  death  had  not  been  reached  in  any  of  the 
treatment arms. The HR for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47; 0.88, p = 0.0053) but the O’Brien-Fleming 
stopping boundary was not met (HR ≤ 0.603, p ≤ 0.0012).  
The  second  interim  analysis  of  OS  (data  cut-off  May  13th  2012)  collected  events  one  year  after  the 
data  cut-off  of  the  primary  analysis,  by  adding  102  deaths.  At  the  time  of  this  second  analysis 
(considered as the final OS analysis), 267 deaths had occurred, specifically 154 events (37.9%) in the 
placebo  arm  and  113  events  (28.1%)  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  Results  from  the  second  and  final  OS 
analysis showed a significant survival benefit for patients randomized to receive pertuzumab (stratified 
by prior treatment status and region): HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.52; 0.84, p= 0.0008).  Median survival 
was  of  37.6  months  in  the  placebo  arm  and  was  not  still  reached  in  the  pertuzumab  arm.  Survival 
rates  showed  a  sustained  survival  advantage  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  0.94,  0.81  and  0.66  for  the 
PTZ+T+D arm and 0.89, 0.69 and 0.50 in the Pl+T+D arm at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively.  
A higher ORR was observed in the Ptz+T+D arm (80.2%) compared to the Pla+T+D arm (69.3%). The 
majority of responses in the Ptz arm were  PRs. The median duration of responses was also longer in 
the Ptz arm (87.6 weeks) than in the Placebo arm (54.1 weeks).   
No difference in QoL was observed between treatment arms based on the FACT-B questionnaire.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Patients  with  non-visceral  disease  (n=178)  appeared  to  get  the  smallest  benefit  from  the  addition  of 
Ptz  based  on  a  subgroup  analysis  (HR=0.96  (0.61;  1.52)).  This  is  somewhat  unexpected  from  a 
mechanistic  point of  view  as  HER2  blockade  is  also  known  to  be  efficacious  in  earlier  disease  stages. 
The  relatively  wide  confidence  intervals  reveal  that  the  estimate  is  not  very  precise  in  this 
subpopulation.    As  pointed  out,  in  this  small  size  subgroup,  events  occurred  at  lower  rate  (only  33 
deaths in 178 pts) when compared to the visceral disease status subgroup. The CHMP agreed that the 
subgroup  characteristics  (small  size  and  low  rate  of  event  occurrence)  may  have  affected  the  large 
variability of the point estimate and the probability to capture a true treatment effect (low power).  
Perjeta

In  addition,  imbalances  in  certain  demographics/disease  characteristics  may  also  have  contributed  to 
the reduced treatment effect observed in the non visceral disease subgroup. Further studies have not 
been requested.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Common AEs in the pivotal study (incidence >25%) were alopecia (60.5% in the placebo arm, 60.9% 
in 
the  pertuzumab  arm),  diarrhoea  (46.3%/66.8%),  neutropenia  (49.6%/52.8%),  nausea 
(41.6%/42.3%),  fatigue  (36.8%/37.6%),  rash  (24.2%/33.7%),  asthenia  (30.2%/26.0%),  decreased 
appetite 
(26.4%/29.2%),  peripheral  oedema 
(30.0%/23.1%)  and  mucosal 
inflammation 
19.9%/27.8%).  So  when  Ptz  was  added  to  T  +  D  the  safety  profile  was  generally  not  changing, 
however, more diarrhoea, rash, mucosal inflammation, dry skin and (febrile) neutropenia were seen.  
Overall,  no  difference  in  grade  3-4  events  was  observed  between  the  placebo  and  pertuzumab  arms 
(72.0%  and  73.5%,  respectively).  It  was  mainly  the  rates  of  febrile  neutropenia  and  diarrhoea  of 
grade  3+  that  were  higher  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  compared to the  control  arm.  LVSD  of  grade  3  or 
higher  was  reported  less  frequently  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  (1.2%)  compared  to  the  placebo  arm 
(2.8%). 
AEs resulting in death were observed in 2.5% of patients in the placebo arm and in 2.0% of patients in 
the  pertuzumab  arm.  No  accumulation  of  specific  causes  was  noted.  In  particular,  no  deaths  were 
attributed to heart failure. Although neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were observed more often in 
the pertuzumab arm, the number of deaths because of febrile neutropenia or infections was similar in 
the two treatment arms. 
A higher number of patients in the pertuzumab arm reported SAEs (34.4%) compared to 26.2% in the 
Pla+T+D arm. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia and infections. The incidence of febrile 
neutropenia almost doubled in the Ptz-treated patients (11.3% in the Ptz arm vs. 5.0% in the Placebo 
arm), whereas only a modest increase in the incidence of infections was actually noted (10.8% in the 
Ptz  arm  vs.  7.3%  in  the  Placebo  arm).  The  incidence  of  all  other  SAEs  was  <  5%  in  both  treatment 
arms.  
The  proportion  of  patients  stopping  docetaxel  treatment  due  to  toxicity  was  similar  across  treatment 
arms (23.2% of patients in the Placebo arm vs. 23.6% of patients in the Ptz arm). The most common 
reasons  were  oedema,  fatigue  and  peripheral  neuropathy.  The  number  of  patients  who  discontinued 
due  to  neutropenia  was  also  similar  (7  patients  in  each  arm),  but  in  addition,  4  patients  in  the 
Ptz+T+D  arm  stopped  docetaxel  due  to  febrile  neutropenia  vs.  none  in  the  Placebo  arm.  When 
excluding  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  docetaxel  alone,  relatively  few  patients  stopped  study 
medication due to AEs and the proportion was similar across treatment arms (5.3% in the Placebo arm 
vs. 6.1% in the pertuzumab arm). 
Safety  update:  An additional 6 months of safety data has been provided (new safety cut-off date: 7 
November 2011, the original safety cut-off date was 13 May 2011). Reassuringly, the updated safety 
profile  is  very  consistent  to  what  was  reported  in  the  original  MAA.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  still 
higher  in  the  Ptz  arm  (35.6%)  compared  with  the  Placebo  arm  (28.0%),  especially  because  of  more 
cases  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  the  Ptz  arm.  In  contrast,  more  patients  had  died  in  the  Placebo  arm 
(28.7%) compared with the Ptz arm (22.4%). Most patients died because of PD. Since the first safety 
report, two more deaths from other causes than PD were reported (one unrelated case of myocardial 
infarction in the Placebo arm and one unevaluable death in the Ptz arm). Two additional patients in the 
Placebo arm had Grade ≥ 3 LVSD and one additional patient in the Ptz arm had developed CHF. More

common  AEs  associated  with  Ptz  were  still  diarrhea,  rash,  mucosal  inflammation,  febrile  neutropenia 
and dry skin. The severity of events was overall similar to what was previously reported. No new safety 
events were identified.  
The  cardiac  safety  profile  of  Ptz  has  been  described  in  detail  and  updated.  No  differences  were 
observed  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  terms  of  incidence  of  cardiac  AEs.  Left  ventricular 
dysfunction,  as  in  the  previous  report,  was  the  most  common  cardiac  AE  (Pla+T+D:  8.6%  and 
PTZ+T+D: 5.2%). 
Risk  factors  of  cardiotoxicity  have  been  identified  (mainly  prior  anthracycline  therapy  and  prior 
radiotherapy). Based on data from the pivotal trial, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction was 5.6% in 
the  Placebo  arm  compared  with  0.8%  in  the  Ptz  arm  patients  who  had  never  received  prior 
anthracyclines  or  trastuzumab  (n=477).  Prior  anthracycline  therapy  (n  =  239)  resulted  in  a  higher 
incidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  (mainly  LVEF  declines)  in  both  treatment  arms,  the  increase  was 
however  slightly  more  marked  in  the  Ptz  arm  (Placebo:  8.9%,  Ptz:  12.1%)  which  could  be  a  chance 
finding.  Prior  trastuzumab  exposure  did  not  seem  to  increase  the  risk  of  cardiotoxicity.  The  cardiac 
dysfunction  was  reversible  in  the  majority  of  patients.  The  updated  cardiac  safety  review  did  not 
identify new concerns.  
Relevant information about risk factors and exclusion criteria in the pivotal trial has been provided in 
the SmPC. Cardiac disorders have been included in the RMP.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Only  patients  with  a  preserved  cardiac  function  and  no  known  risk  factors  for  cardiotoxicity  were 
included in the pivotal trial. These exclusion criteria are provided in the SmPC. 
No  studies  have  been  performed  in  patients  with  impaired  liver  function.  This  may  be  considered  a 
deficiency since patients with MBC will often have liver involvement and abnormal liver function tests. 
However,  it  is  considered  that  the  SmPC  and  RMP  adequately  reflects  the  missing  data  and  provide 
sufficient reassurance and information. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A HR for PFS (IRF-assessed) of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51; 0.75, p < 0.0001) translates into a 38% reduction 
in the risk of progression or death in patients treated with the Ptz+T+D combination. The median PFS 
was 18.5 months in the Ptz arm compared to 12.4 months in the Placebo arm, resulting in an absolute 
gain  of  6.1  months  in  median  PFS  in  patients treated  with  Ptz+T+D.  A  PFS  gain  of  this  magnitude  is 
considered  important  from  a  clinical  point  of  view  and  it  is  statistically  compelling.  A  number  of 
sensitivity analyses have confirmed the robustness of the result. The pre-specified subgroup analyses 
demonstrated  very  consistent  benefits  in  most  subgroups,  also  in  patients  who  had  received  prior 
(neo-) adjuvant therapy (50%), in elderly patients and in patients with HR+ tumours.  
A  statistically  significant  OS  benefit  in  favour  of  the  Ptz-containing  arm  was  demonstrated  in  the 
second (and final) OS interim analysis. 
Overall,  the  addition  of  Ptz  to  T+D  did  not  change  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  T+D  combination, 
but  increased  toxicity  was  observed,  primarily  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucosal  inflammation  and  (febrile)

neutropenia. Higher incidence of grade 3+ febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea and as well as more SAEs 
(mainly  febrile  neutropenia  and  infections)  were  observed  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  compared  to  the 
control  arm.  On  the  other  hand,  more  patients  died  in  the  placebo  arm,  mainly  because  of  PD.  The 
incidence of AEs resulting in death was similar between treatment arms. Indeed, relatively few patients 
stopped study medication due to AEs and the proportion was also similar across treatment arms (5.3% 
in the Placebo arm vs. 6.1% in the Ptz arm) indicating that the tolerability of the regimen was overall 
acceptable.  Importantly,  there  is  currently  no  indication  that  the  addition  of  Ptz  to  T+D  significantly 
increased the risk of cardiotoxicity. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The totality of data indicates that Ptz offered substantial and consistent benefits of clinical relevance in 
a  patient  population  with  a  limited  number  of  treatment  options.  Although  added  toxicity  was 
observed, the safety profile was overall acceptable.  
In  summary,  the  benefit  of  pertuzumab,  both  in  the  overall  patient  population  as  well  as  in  patients 
pre-treated  with  trastuzumab,  is  considered  clinically  relevant  and  sufficiently  supported  by  the 
available evidence. In support, study BO17929 documented the activity of Ptz in patients pre-treated 
with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. The results of the ongoing studies PHEREXA (2nd line MBC) 
and  PERUSE  (1st  line  MBC)  will  be  able  to  further  confirm  the  size  of  effect  associated  with  Ptz  in 
patients pre-treated with trastuzumab and will be submitted (Annex II obligations).      
Concerns had been raised that the risk of cardiotoxicity might have been underestimated in the pivotal 
trial.  This  issue  has  also  been  adequately  addressed  and  it  has  been  concluded  that  there  is  no 
indication of a significantly increased risk of cardiotoxicity when adding Ptz to T+D. 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Perjeta,  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  in  adult 
patients  with  HER2-positive  metastatic  or  locally  recurrent  unresectable  breast  cancer,  who  have  not 
received  previous  anti-HER2  therapy  or  chemotherapy  for  their  metastatic  disease,  is  favourable  and 
therefore  recommends    the  granting  of  the    marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

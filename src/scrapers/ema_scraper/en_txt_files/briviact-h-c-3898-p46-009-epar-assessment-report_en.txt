2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study N01349 - A Multicenter, Open-Label, Single-Arm Study to 
Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, and Safety of Brivaracetam in 
Neonates with Repeated Electroencephalographic Seizures 
Description 
N01349  was a Phase 2/3, multicenter,  open-label, single-arm study  to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and 
safety of BRV in neonates with  repeated electroencephalographic seizures. This study consisted of a 2-
step design (step 1=Exploratory Cohort; step 2=Confirmatory Cohort) and was planned to include a 
descriptive comparison with  a historical control group (matched in age and condition) from literature 
treated with  AEDs per standard of care and diagnostic methods.  
Since the  first study sites of N01349  were activated in Jan 2018, recruitment proved to be a challenge. 
The Exploratory Cohort was completed on 29 Sep 2020,  after almost 3  years of recruitment. 
Recruitment for the Confirmatory Cohorts was opened on 13  Nov 2020, but  no study participants were 
successfully enrolled in the  Confirmatory Cohort after more than  a year. The study was stopped 13 
months after the Confirmatory Cohort was opened, following agreement with  the Pediatric Committee 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

(EMA Decision P/0003/2022  dated 18 Jan 2022),  because it was considered infeasible and no eligible 
study participants enrolled into  this Cohort.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The study included neonates with  epilepsy who had seizures that  were not adequately controlled with 
previous antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. To be eligible to  participate in  this study, study 
participants must have been at least 34 weeks of corrected gestational age (CGA). In addition, term 
neonates up  to 27 days of PNA and preterm neonates up to 40 weeks of CGA and 27 days of PNA could 
have been enrolled. Study participants weighed at least 2.3kg at the time of enrolment. 
Treatments 
After implementation of Protocol Amendment 6  (dated 28 Oct 2019),  study participants enrolled into 
the Exploratory Cohort received 1 or more of the following AEDs prior to or at the time  of enrollment: 
phenobarbital (PB), midazolam (MDZ), phenytoin (PHT), levetiracetam, or lidocaine for the treatment 
of ENS (first line, second line,  or subsequent treatment; choice of treatment, dose, and dosing 
frequency were at the  discretion of the Investigator) prior to receiving BRV. 
For all study participants, subsequently, a 0.5mg/kg BRV intravenous (iv) solution  for injection was 
administered. At the discretion of the  Investigator, 3 additional iv BRV doses, up  to a total  of 4 iv BRV 
doses (0.5mg/kg bid),  could have been administered during the 48-hour Evaluation Period. This 
treatment, which  was the  first use of BRV in  neonates, was 4-fold less than  the highest dose of 
4mg/kg/day dosage (2mg/kg bid)  that has been used previously in infants ≥1 month old. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BRV in neonates who had seizures 
that  were not adequately controlled with  previous AED treatment, and to identify the optimal BRV dose 
(Exploratory Cohort) for the treatment of study participants planned to be enrolled into the 
Confirmatory Cohorts of this  study.  
The secondary objectives were as follows:  
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of BRV in severe and non-severe seizure burden (defined as total 
minutes of electroencephalographic neonatal seizures [ENS] per hour) in neonates with 
seizures that  were not adequately controlled with  previous AED treatment  
To evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of BRV in neonates.  
However, efficacy was not evaluated since the study was stopped after the  Exploratory Cohort due to 
the lack of enrollment of eligible study participants. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics 
The primary PK variable was the plasma concentration of BRV following the  first dose on Day 1.   
Other PK variables were as follows:  
• 
• 
Plasma concentrations of BRV on other occasions  
Plasma concentrations of BRV metabolites ucb-42145 (acid), ucb-100406-1  (hydroxy), and 
ucb-107092-1  (hydroxyacid)

•  Area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax 
(tmax), elimination half-life (t½),  volume of distribution  (Vd), and clearance (CL) of BRV  
• 
Plasma concentrations of concomitant AEDs if administered 
Safety   
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of BRV in severe and non-severe seizure burden (defined as total 
minutes of electroencephalographic neonatal seizures [ENS] per hour) in neonates with  seizures that 
were not  adequately controlled with previous AED treatment 
• 
To evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of BRV in neonates 
However, efficacy was not evaluated since the study was stopped after the  Exploratory Cohort due to 
the lack of enrollment of eligible study participants. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The secondary safety variable was adverse events (AEs) as reported by the  Investigator. 
•  Other safety variables described below are for both  the Exploratory Cohort and Confirmatory 
Cohorts. Note: Safety variables were collected in the Exploratory Cohort only as no eligible 
study participants were enrolled into the Confirmatory Cohorts.

apneas], oxygen saturation [pulse oximetry], and body temperature) to  3 hours, 6  hours, 
9 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 18 hours, 21 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours 
•  Change from Baseline in safety laboratory tests  to the end of the Evaluation Period 
•  Change from Baseline in heart rate at 3 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 96  hours after the start 
of initial BRV treatment 
•  Change from Baseline in physical and neurological examination 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 
and 96 hours after the  start of initial BRV treatment  (Sarnat scale; for study participants with

Neurodevelopmental tests validated for age and language were done after 1  year for study participants 
who entered the long-term follow-up study in countries where a validated translation of the  Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development®, Third Edition  (Bayley-III®) score was available. 
Efficacy 
The planned efficacy endpoints are not listed. Since no patient  was included in the Confirmatory 
Cohort, there were no efficacy data to report.  
Sample size 
At least 42 evaluable study participants were planned to  be enrolled in  this study, with  at least 6 study 
participants in the  Exploratory Cohort and at least 36 study participants  enrolled in 3 successive 
Confirmatory Cohorts, each consisting of 12 study participants.   
This was a multicenter  study that enrolled study participants in 4 countries, and 3 investigational sites 
enrolled 6 eligible participants. 
Randomisation and  blinding (masking) 
Not  applicable as the study was single-arm, open-label. 
Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics,  such as the number of study participants with  available measurement (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum value, and maximum value for quantitative  variables, and 
counts and percentages for categorical variables, were provided. 
In general, descriptive summaries were used to present study results overall for the  Exploratory 
Cohort. By-participant listings were provided and presented source data and key derived variables for 
statistical  analyses. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics summary tables and listings  were produced for the pharmacokinetic per-protocol set 
(PK-PPS). By-participant listings of the PK parameters and plasma concentrations were provided. 
For the Exploratory Cohort, summary tables were provided for the PK parameters; and for plasma 
concentrations of BRV, ucb-42145,  ucb-100406-1,  ucb-107092-1,  and of concomitant AEDs (PB and 
PHT). Individual plots of plasma concentrations over time were provided. 
Brivaracetam doses and concentration measurements in participants in  the Exploratory Cohort were 
analyzed to determine the PK parameters. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using Bayesian 
feedback: Individual-specific parameters were determined using  the participant’s dosing history and 
BRV concentration assessments, where prior information on the typical population parameters in 
children (<16 years of age) and their inter-individual variability was taken into  account. The prior 
information was provided by a model (Run412 in PopPK report CL0187)  that  described BRV PK 
following oral administration using a one-compartment first order absorption model with allometric 
scaling of clearance and central volume to body weight using fixed allometric constants of three-
fourths and 1, respectively. 
Safety 
All safety analyses were presented for the safety set (SS). Descriptive summaries were presented.

Results 
Recruitment 
Nine study participants were enrolled into  the study; 3 participants failed screening due to ineligibility. 
The remaining 6 eligible study participants were enrolled into the  Exploratory Cohort of the study at 3 
investigational sites. Six study participants  (100%) entered the Evaluation Period and were treated 
with  BRV. Four study participants (66.7%)  completed the Evaluation Period, entered the Safety Follow-
Up Period, and completed the study. Two study participants (33.3%)  entered the BRV Extension Period 
and rolled over to the  long-term follow-up study.

All 6 eligible study participants in the Exploratory Cohort completed the study and composed the SS 
and the PK-PPS (Table 3). No study participants were included in the FAS due to  the lack of enrolment 
for the Confirmatory Cohorts. Therefore, no efficacy analyses were conducted. 
PK results 
Due to  the small number of study participants enrolled, a planned analysis related to the concomitant 
use of hypothermia could not be conducted. In addition,  since sparse sampling was used in the study, 
noncompartmental analysis could not be used to  analyze the BRV data, and, instead, modeling and 
simulation were used to  analyze the BRV data. 
A spaghetti plot of individual BRV plasma concentrations over time is provided for the PK-PPS in Figure 
1. A summary of BRV plasma concentrations over time on Day 1 is presented for the PK-PPS in Table 
4.

Brivaracetam was detectable in the plasma at  all PK timepoints assessed in participants with  evaluable 
samples. Following  iv administration of BRV, on Day 1 the highest geometric mean (GeoMean 
[GeoCV]) plasma concentration of BRV was observed during the 0.5-hour to 1-hour  time period (534.2 
ng/mL [15.4%]);  plasma concentrations declined with  time thereafter. Inter-individual variability in 
GeoMean plasma concentration varied between 13.2%  and 28.2%. 
A summary of plasma PK parameters for BRV is presented in Table 5. 
Table 5  Plasma PK parameters of BRV after iv administration 
The GeoMean (GeoCV) AUC(0-12),  AUC and Cmax values were 4.437h*mg/L  (9.1%),  6.751h*mg/L 
(12.8%),  and 0.604 mg/L  (7.3%), respectively (Table 8-2). The median tmax was 15 minutes 
(minimum 15  minutes, maximum 30  minutes), and the GeoMean (GeoCV) t1/2  was 7.647 hours 
(8.3%).  The GeoMean (GeoCV) Vd, and CL values were 2.570L  (27.1)  and 3.884mL/min  (30.3%). 
Spaghetti plots of individual plasma concentrations of BRV metabolites ucb-42145,  ucb-100406-1,  and 
ucb-107092-1  over time are provided in Figure 2. Plasma concentrations of the 3 BRV metabolites 
(ucb-42145,  ucb-100406-1,  and ucb-107092-1)  were lower than  BRV plasma concentrations.

Plasma concentrations of concomitant AEDs were collected (data not shown). 
In summary, brivaracetam was quantifiable in plasma at all PK timepoints  assessed in participants with 
evaluable samples, and plasma concentrations were consistent  with data from adults receiving an 
equivalent iv dose (25mg bid). The highest GeoMean BRV plasma concentration was observed between 
the 0.5-hour  to 1-hour time period following  iv administration of BRV; concentration declined with  time 
thereafter. Plasma concentrations of the 3 BRV metabolites were lower than  the BRV concentrations. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a model previously developed for participants aged 
1 month  to 16 years. The plasma concentrations observed in the  current study were consistent with 
the PK observed in these older children, the  data of which  were similar to results obtained in adults. 
Discussion on Pharmacokinetics 
In study N01349,  brivaracetam PK and safety were characterized in a limited  number of neonates who 
had seizures that  were not adequately controlled with  previous AED treatment.  Due to problems with 
recruitment, the study was stopped before any patient  was enrolled in the Confirmatory Cohort. PK 
and safety data are available from 6 patients in the Exploratory Cohort; No  data on efficacy are 
available.  
The MAH concludes the plasma concentrations observed in the current study were consistent with  the 
PK observed in adults receiving an equivalent iv dose (25mg bid).  Overall, the Assessor agrees that PK

parameters appears to be comparable to the  equivalent adult  dose, however, since only a limited 
number of patients  were available (n=6),  it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions regarding 
similarity between neonates and adults.  
The limited amount of data is the main limitation  of this  analysis. Another limitation is that  the only 
observed dose level (0.5  mg/kg) is most likely subtherapeutic in  most subjects. Nevertheless, the  PK 
data was presented and analysed in a reasonable manner; the observed data collected with  a sparse 
design were presented graphically in spaghetti plots and several PK parameters were estimated using 
modelling and simulation (Bayesian feedback of a previous paediatric PopPK model).

Three study participants (50.0%)  received 1 dose of BRV and 3 participants (50.0%)  received >1 
dose. During the Evaluation Period, BRV was administered as iv infusion only. During the BRV 
Extension Period, participants switched  from BRV iv to oral solution before entering the long term 
study. Six participants (100%) received iv BRV during the Evaluation Period; only 2 study participants 
(33.0%)  entered the BRV Extension Period and were treated with BRV oral solution. Overall, the 
median treatment duration of iv BRV was 30.00  hours (range: 12.00  hours to 387.58  hours).

CHMP  comments 
Even though 3 additional doses of BRV were allowed during  the 48 hours evaluation period only 3 
patients received more than 1  dose. Also, it is noted that  only 2 patients entered extension period of 
the study. The reasons why 3 patients did not  receive additional BRV doses as well as 4 patients did 
not enter extension period are not really discussed.

Data source: N01349 CSR Table 8.1 
For two of the study participants  who were screen failures, a total  of 4  AEs were reported; none of the 
AEs were severe, serious, or attributed  to IMP as the participants did not  receive IMP. Of the 6 study 
participants enrolled in  the Exploratory Cohort, for 3 study participants  (50.0%) 4 TEAEs were 
reported, none of which were considered to be drug related by the Investigator (Table 5  2). For 1 
study participant (16.7%),  1 serious TEAE was reported that  was considered severe in intensity.   
No study participant  discontinued from the study.  No deaths were reported during the  study.

Most common TEAEs 
Treatment-emergent adverse events following investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration 
were in  the System Organ Classes (SOCs) of Blood and lymphatic system disorders, Eye disorders, 
Metabolism and nutrition  disorders, and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorder (1 participant 
[16.7%]  each). For 1  study participant (16.7%)  each, by preferred term (PT), the following TEAEs 
were reported: anemia, dry eye, hyperglycemia, and apnea during the  study. 
CHMP  comments  
The most TEAEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity.  It is noted that neither of reported 
TEAEs, - anemia, dry eye, hyperglycemia, and apnea - are currently listed in the  SmPC of BRV. 
However, single reports in very few patients  which received even concomitant ASD (MDZ, Phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, levetiracetam) does not allow to  draw any conclusions. 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  by maximum intensity 
For 1 study participant  (16.7%), 1  TEAE of severe apnea was reported (see Section 5.1.2.6  for 
details). All other TEAEs were of mild to moderate intensity (N01349  CSR Table 8.1.4). 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  by relationship 
No TEAEs were considered related to IMP by the  Investigator (N01349  CSR Table 8.15). 
Other  serious adverse events 
For 1 study participant  (16.7%), a serious TEAE of apnea was reported during the  study and was 
related to  MDZ. The study participant’s apnea was severe in intensity,  was not  assessed as related to 
IMP by the Investigator and did not lead to discontinuation  from the  study. 
Other  significant adverse events 
For 1 study participant  (16.7%), hyperglycemia was reported which was considered as an AE of 
interest (N01349  CSR Table 8.25,  N01349  CSR Table 8.28). This AE was moderate in intensity,  was 
not assessed as related to IMP by the Investigator and did not  lead to discontinuation  from the  study. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
Mean and median changes from Baseline for hematology and clinical chemistry variables were 
generally small and not  considered to be clinically meaningful during the study. No  trends were 
identified. The values were generally within  normal ranges. Due to the limited number of study 
participants, no definite conclusions could be drawn. 
One study participant (1/4 participants;  25.0%) had possibly clinically significant  treatment emergent 
(PCST) Grade 2 high  post-Baseline hemoglobin levels at the 48 hour timepoint  during the Evaluation 
Period. No TEAEs related to abnormal hematology findings  were reported during the study. 
One study participant (1/5 participants;  20.0%) each had PCST Grade 2 high post-Baseline potassium 
and sodium levels at the 48-hour timepoint  during the Evaluation Period. One study participant 
(20.0%)  had PCST Grade 2 low post-Baseline sodium levels at the 48  hour timepoint during the 
Evaluation Period. One study participant (20.0%)  had PCST Grade 2 high post-Baseline glucose levels 
at the 24-hour  timepoint during the Evaluation Period. This participant had PCST Grade 2 high glucose 
levels at Baseline and also experienced a TEAE of hyperglycemia.  
No study participants showed evidence of potential drug-induced liver injury (PDILI) during the  study.

Vital  signs 
Changes in  important vital signs, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), heart rate, and respiration rate, were temporary and returned to Baseline within  24 hours to 48 
hours. No significant signals were observed.  
No critical PCST vital signs, including  SBP, DBP, respiration rate, and heart rate, were observed in 
study participants treated with  BRV in the Exploratory Cohort. 
Other  observations related  to safety 
Due to  the limited number of study participants, no definite conclusions could be drawn.  
The values for physical and neurological examination findings,  Thompson score, and biometric 
parameters were generally within  normal ranges. No trends were identified. No  participant had 
withdrawal and rebound phenomenon. 
One study participant (16.7%)  required mechanical ventilation  during the Evaluation Period. The mean 
duration of ventilation for this participant was 1.017  hours. No other study participants required 
mechanical ventilation. 
Due to  the small number of participants (n=3)  undergoing hypothermia treatment, it  was not possible 
draw conclusions regarding hypothermia treatment. 
The Bayley-III scales were not used for analysis in this study. 
Safety  conclusions by the MAH 
• 
The median treatment  duration of iv BRV was 30.00  hours (range: 12.00  hours to  387.58 
hours). 
• 
For 3 study participants (50.0%),  4 TEAEs were reported, none of which  were drug-related as 
assessed by the Investigator. 
• 
The reported TEAEs following IMP administration were in  the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, Eye disorders, Metabolism and nutrition  disorders, and Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorder. For 1 study participant (16.7%)  each, by PT, the following  TEAEs were reported: 
anemia, dry eye, hyperglycemia, and apnea. 
• 
There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to  discontinuation during the  study. All reported TEAEs 
were of mild to moderate intensity except for 1 participant (16.7%)  who experienced a serious TEAE of 
apnea that  was severe in intensity. 
• 
For 1 study participant  (16.7%), a TEAE of hyperglycemia was reported, which was moderate 
in intensity  and was considered an AE of interest. 
• 
Hematology and clinical chemistry values were generally within  the normal ranges. No trends 
were identified.  Due to the limited  number of study participants, no definite conclusions could be 
drawn. 
• 
Changes in  vital signs (SBP, DBP, heart rate, respiration rate) were temporary. No critical PCST 
vital signs were observed in study participants treated with  BRV. 
• 
The values for physical and neurological examination findings,  Thompson score, N-PASS score, 
and biometric parameters were generally within  normal ranges. No trends were identified. No 
participant had withdrawal  and rebound phenomenon. 
• 
No PDILI events were reported by any participant.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical safety aspects 
The planned N01349  study was a Phase 2/3,  multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the 
PK, efficacy, and safety of BRV in neonates with  repeated electroencephalographic seizures. Only the 
first step of the N01349  study from a planned 2 step design (step 1=Exploratory Cohort; step 
2=Confirmatory Cohorts) was completed. In agreement with  PDCO the  study was terminated since 
completion of it was considered to be infeasible.  
Only six patients  were included into the  first exploratory cohort. The most common TEAEs reported 
were mild or moderate in intensity.  It is noted that  neither of reported TEAEs, - anemia, dry eye, 
hyperglycemia, and apnea - are currently listed  in the SmPC of BRV. However, single reports in very 
few patients which  received even concomitant ASD (MDZ, Phenytoin, phenobarbital, levetiracetam) 
does not  allow to draw any conclusions. 
The benefit risk balance of brivaracetam when used in patients  according to approved indication 
remains unchanged. 
Currently, the following statement is included in section 4.8  of the SmPC under the  heading “Paediatric 
population”:   
“<…>  No clinical data are available in neonates. <…>” 
Since safety information is currently available from 6  neonates, this  statement may be considered as 
not correctly reflecting the current level of knowledge and it  could be recommended to modify it  as 
follows (new text in bold, removed text – strikethrough): 
“<…>  Limited no clinical data are available in neonates. <…>” 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
Only the first exploratory part of the planned N01349 study was completed. In agreement with PDCO 
the study was terminated since completion of it  was considered to  be infeasible.  
No efficacy data were generated. Only limited  pharmacokinetic and safety data from 6 patients  were 
available. 
It is considered acceptable to not  update the Briviact SmPC based on the pharmacokinetic results from 
study N01349. 
In view of the available limited  clinical safety data regarding use of brivaracetam in neonates from the 
N01349  study and the information currently present in the  SmPC stating that  no clinical data in 
neonates are available, this discrepancy should be corrected, and the  MAH should either submit a 
variation in  accordance with Articles 16  and 17 of Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004  or provide a 
justification for not doing so. This should be provided without  any delay and no later than  60 days 
after the  receipt of these conclusions.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Twinrix Paediatric is indicated for use in non immune infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up 
to and including 15 years who are at risk of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology  
- Dosage 
The dose of 0.5 ml (360 ELISA Units HA/10 µg HBsAg) is recommended for infants, children and 
adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age. 
- Primary vaccination schedule 
The standard primary course of vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric consists of three doses, the first 
administered at the elected date, the second one month later and the third six months after the first 
dose. The recommended schedule should be adhered to. Once initiated, the primary course of 
vaccination should be completed with the same vaccine. 
- Booster dose 
In situations where a booster dose of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B is desired, a monovalent or combined 
vaccine can be given. The safety and immunogenicity of Twinrix Paediatric administered as a booster 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose following a three-dose primary course have not been evaluated. 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric are available up to 
15 years after vaccination (see section 5.1).  
The anti-HBs and anti-HAV antibody titres observed following a primary vaccination course with the 
combined vaccine are in the range of what is seen following vaccination with the monovalent 
vaccines. General guidelines for booster vaccination can therefore be drawn from experience with the 
monovalent vaccines, as follows.   
Hepatitis B 
The need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full 
primary vaccination course has not been established; however some official vaccination programmes 
currently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be 
respected. 
For some categories of subjects or patients exposed to HBV (e.g. haemodialysis or 
immunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure a protective 
antibody level ≥ 10IU/l. 
Hepatitis A 
It is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis 
A vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be 
ensured by immunological memory. Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that 
antibodies are required for protection. 
In situations where a booster dose of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are desired, Twinrix Paediatric 
can be given. Alternatively, subjects primed with Twinrix Paediatric may be administered a booster 
dose of either of the monovalent vaccines. 
Method of administration  
Twinrix Paediatric is for intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid region in adolescents and 
children or in the anterolateral thigh in infants. 
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or 
bleeding disorders. However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response 
to the vaccine (see section 4.4). 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or neomycin. 
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines. 
The administration of Twinrix Paediatric should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe 
febrile illness. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a 
psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs 
such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It 
is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
It is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a HA or HB infection at the time of 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccination. It is not known whether Twinrix Paediatric will prevent HA and HB in such cases. 
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and 
other pathogens known to infect the liver. 
Twinrix Paediatric is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e.g. needle stick injury). 
The vaccine has not been tested in patients with impaired immunity.  In haemodialysis patients, 
patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with an impaired immune system, the 
anticipated immune response may not be achieved after the primary immunisation course. Such 
patients may require additional doses of vaccine; nevertheless immunocompromised patients may fail 
to demonstrate an adequate response. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a 
suboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided. However, exceptionally Twinrix 
Paediatric can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding 
disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects (see 
section 4.2). 
Twinrix Paediatric should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No data on concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric with specific hepatitis A 
immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated.  However, when the monovalent 
hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins, 
no influence on seroconversion was observed although it may result in lower antibody titres. 
Twinrix Paediatric can be given concomitantly with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. 
Administration of Twinrix Paediatric at the same time as Cervarix (HPV vaccine) has shown no 
clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to the HPV and hepatitis A antigens. Anti-
HBs geometric mean antibody concentrations were lower on co-administration, but the clinical 
significance of this observation is not known since the seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The 
proportion of subjects reaching anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/ml was 98.3% for concomitant vaccination and 
100% for Twinrix alone. 
Only the concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric with Cervarix has been specifically 
studied. It is advised that vaccines other than Cervarix should not be administered at the same time as 
Twinrix Paediatric. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy  
The effect of Twinrix Paediatrict on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development 
has been assessed in rats. This study did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect of Twinrix Paediatric on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development 
has not been prospectively evaluated in clinical trials. 
Data on outcomes of a limited number of pregnancies in vaccinated women do not indicate any 
adverse effects of Twinrix Paediatric on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. While 
it is not expected that recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen would have adverse effects on 
pregnancies or the fetus it is recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after delivery 
unless there is an urgent need to protect the mother against hepatitis B infection. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether Twinrix Paediatric is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Twinrix 
Paediatric in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue 
breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Twinrix Paediatric should be made taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Twinrix Paediatric therapy to the 
woman. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Twinrix Paediatric has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile presented below is based on data from approximately 800 subjects. The most

5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code: J07BC20. 
Twinrix Paediatric is a combined vaccine formulated by pooling bulk preparations of the purified, 
inactivated hepatitis A (HA) virus and purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), separately 
adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. 
The HA virus is propagated in MRC5 human diploid cells. HBsAg is produced by culture, in a 
selective medium, of genetically engineered yeast cells. 
Twinrix Paediatric confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HA 
and anti-HBs antibodies. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B develops within 2-4 weeks.  In the clinical studies, 
specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis A were observed in approximately 89% of the subjects 
one month after the first dose and in 100% one month after the third dose (i.e. month 7).  Specific 
humoral antibodies against hepatitis B were observed in approximately 67% of the subjects after the 
first dose and 100% after the third dose. 
In two long-term clinical trials, persistence of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies has been demonstrated 
up to 5 years in children aged 1-11 years and up to 15 years in children aged 12-15 years.  
At 5 years following initiation of a 0, 1, 6 month schedule of Twinrix Paediatric in children aged 1-11 
years all subjects followed up retained ≥15 mIU/ml anti-HAV antibody and 97% had anti-HBs antibody 
≥10 mIU/ml. 
At 15 years following the initiation of a 0, 1, 6 month schedule of Twinrix Paediatric in children aged 
12-15 years, all subjects followed up retained ≥15 mIU/ml anti-HAV antibody and 81.8% had anti-HBs 
antibody ≥10 mIU/ml. A challenge dose of a HBV vaccine was given to a limited number of subjects 
(n=11) whose anti-HBs antibody concentrations had decreased to <10 mIU/ml and 10 of the 11 subjects 
(90.9%) mounted an anamnestic response. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on general safety studies.

The vaccine should be re-suspended following the steps below. 
1.  Hold the syringe upright in a closed hand. 
2.  Shake the syringe by tipping it upside down and back again. 
3.  Repeat this action vigorously for at least 15 seconds. 
4.  Inspect the vaccine again: 
a. If the vaccine appears as a uniform hazy white suspension, it is ready to use – the 
appearance should not be clear. 
b. If the vaccine still does not appear as a uniform hazy white suspension - tip upside 
down and back again for at least another 15 seconds - then inspect again. 
The vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical 
appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, do not administer the 
vaccine.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Twinrix Paediatric is and what it is used for  
Twinrix Paediatric is a vaccine used in infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and 
including 15 years to prevent two diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing 
the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. 
• 
• 
Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver. This disease is 
caused by the hepatitis A virus. The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in 
food and drink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage. Symptoms of hepatitis A 
begin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus. These consist of nausea (feeling 
sick), fever and aches and pains.  After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become 
yellowish (jaundice). The severity and type of symptoms can vary. Young children may not 
develop jaundice. Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to 
keep people off work for about a month. 
Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become 
swollen (inflamed).  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, 
or saliva (spit) of infected people. 
Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine 
are infectious.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Upon storage, a fine white deposit with a clear colourless layer above may be observed.  
The vaccine should be re-suspended before use. When re-suspended, the vaccine will have a uniform 
hazy white appearance. 
Re-suspension of the vaccine to obtain a uniform hazy white suspension 
The vaccine should be re-suspended following the steps below. 
1. Hold the syringe upright in a closed hand. 
2.  Shake the syringe by tipping it upside down and back again. 
3.  Repeat this action vigorously for at least 15 seconds. 
4.  Inspect the vaccine again: 
a. If the vaccine appears as a uniform hazy white suspension, it is ready to use – the 
appearance should not be clear. 
b. If the vaccine still does not appear as a uniform hazy white suspension - tip upside 
down and back again for at least another 15 seconds - then inspect again. 
The vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical 
appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, do not administer the

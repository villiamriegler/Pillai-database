2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lurasidone is a new chemical entity belonging to the chemical class of piperidinyl-benzisoxazole 
derivatives. It has high affinity for dopamine D2- and serotonergic 5HT2A- and 5-HT7-receptors, 
0.994, 0.47 and 0.495 nM, respectively. It also inhibits α2c-adrenergic receptor and α2a-adrenergic 
receptors with a binding affinity of 10.8 and 40.7 nM respectively. Lurasidone also exhibits some 
partial agonistic effect at the 5HT1A receptor with a binding affinity of 6.38 nM. Lurasidone is not 
bound to cholinergic or muscarinic receptors in humans.   
The pharmaceutical form is a film-coated tablet containing lurasidone and available in three strengths 
18.5 mg, 37 mg and 74 mg, respectively.  
Of note, the doses presented throughout the non-clinical and clinical parts of this assessment report 
are expressed as lurasidone hydrochloride, e.g. 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg. 
The indication initially applied for was the treatment of schizophrenia. The recommended starting dose 
of Latuda is 37 mg once daily. No initial dose titration is required. It is effective in a dose range of 37 
to 148 mg once daily. Dose increase should be based on physician judgement and observed clinical 
response. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 148 mg. 
Schizophrenia is a severe, enduring and debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 1.0% of 
the population throughout the world. It is the 4th leading cause of disability in the developed world for 
ages 15 to 44 years, inclusive. Schizophrenia reduces life expectancy by approximately 10 years, 
mostly as a consequence of suicide. 
Schizophrenia appears as a heterogeneous disorder, with substantial variability in clinical presentation, 
course of illness, and treatment response. Patients with schizophrenia experience positive symptoms, 
negative symptoms, and cognitive deficits and typically have long-term, profound psychosocial 
impairments and are often unresponsive in social situations and withdrawn. 
Although no curative treatments currently exist, patients with schizophrenia can integrate into society 
with appropriate antipsychotic medication, psychological therapy, and community support.  
Antipsychotics are the mainstay of pharmacological intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia. As 
there is large inter-individual variability in response to these drugs, several different antipsychotic 
medications are often tried before the most appropriate one is found. Newer atypical antipsychotic are 
both effective and less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (associated with typical 
antipsychotics) or agranulocytosis (associated with clozapine). While these medications may be less 
likely to cause EPS, they are associated with weight gain, which increases the risk of diabetes and 
metabolic abnormalities including increased cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels. 
The chronic nature of schizophrenia requires long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications. 70% 
to 80% of outpatients with schizophrenia discontinue their treatment either due to lack of efficacy, side 
effects, or non-compliance, hence the need for additional treatments that are effective and well 
tolerated.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets available in three strengths designated as, 
18.5 mg, 37 mg and 74 mg, corresponding to 18.6 mg, 37.2 mg and 74 g mg of lurasidone base. 
Other ingredients are mannitol, pregelatinised starch, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, 
magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, macrogol, carnauba wax and for the 74 mg strength also the 
colorants indigotine and yellow iron oxide.  
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blister packs.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
The chemical name of the active substance lurasidone (INN) is (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-2-{(1R,2R)-2-[4-(1,2-
benzisothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]cyclohexylmethyl}hexahydro-4,7-methano-2H-isoindole-1,3-
dione hydrochloride and is a white to off-white powder.  
Physico-chemical properties such as optical rotation, thermal analysis, pKa, partition coefficient, 
solubility in water and various solvents including ethanol, methanol, acetone and particle size have 
been presented. The active substance is milled to attain the desired particle size. No definite melting 
point has been defined but it decomposes at about 253°C. It is non-hygroscopic. Only one crystal form 
has been produced under the manufacturing conditions. No polymorphism has been observed by 
powder X-ray diffraction measurements, infrared absorption spectrometry or thermal analysis under 
various crystallisation conditions. The crystal X-Ray diffraction confirms the absolute configuration of 
the 6 chiral centres as depicted in the structure below 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
The active substance contained in this medicinal product was claimed by the Applicant to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself. It is not considered to constitute an isomer/mixture of isomers, 
complex, derivative, salt of any active substance already approved in the European Union. The INN of 
the substance is lurasidone, the entity which should be considered the new active substance and which 
is used in the finished product as its hydrochloride salt.  
The Applicant’s justification was accepted and lurasidone is considered a new active substance in itself. 
It was noted, that there are some structural similarities between lurasidone and ziprasidone, another 
active substance approved in the EU for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, it was considered 
that lurasidone is not a derivative of ziprasidone.

Manufacture 
Lurasidone hydrochloride is synthesised according to a nine-step process using three well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications and three intermediates are isolated. Brief descriptions 
of the manufacture of the starting materials have been provided and the active substance synthesis 
has been described in detail including process controls.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information of the synthesis process and process controls, control of materials, critical steps 
and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development has been included in 
the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The synthesis process has been redefined as compared to the original submission. As a consequence, 
some additional manufacturers have been involved in the regulatory synthesis. The Applicant has 
provided satisfactory QP declarations regarding the GMP status of all manufacturers involved in the 
GMP synthesis of the active substance.  
Specification 
The active substance lurasidone specification includes tests for: identification (IR, HPLC and chloride 
anion method), assay (HPLC), description (visual), heavy metals (colour identification), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl-Fischer), residue on ignition (Ph.Eur.) 
and particle size (laser light scattering). The specification (limits and methods) is in line to the one in 
the ASMF dossier and has been adequately justified.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis data was provided for 22 batches obtained by the latest synthetic process (16 
production-scale batches) from the ASMF holder and for 26 batches from the finished product 
manufacturer. The results are in compliance with the proposed specification and confirm the 
consistency of the synthetic process.  
Stability 
Stability studies were presented for three commercial batches and six pilot scale batches of lurasidone 
stored in the commercial packaging. The batches were stored under long term (36 months at 
25°C/60% RH) and accelerated (6 months at 40°C/75% RH) conditions in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. Stability studies were also conducted under stressed conditions (heat, humidity, light, acid, 
alkaline, oxidising). The stability batches were monitored for the following tests: description, assay, 
organic impurities, water content, XRD, particle size, identity, microbial limits, chloride content. The 
methods used were the same as those used for the release testing.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain an immediate release solid dosage 
form of lurasidone as active substance for the treatment of schizophrenia. The finished product 
comprises immediate release film-coated tablets containing 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg lurasidone 
hydrochloride packaged in aluminium/aluminium blisters. With respect to the free base the content of 
the tablets for the respective strengths is 18.6 mg (18.5 mg), 37.2 mg (37 mg) and 74.5 mg (74 mg).  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
In addition to the strengths applied for, a 120 mg tablet (wrt lurasidone hydrochloride) has also been 
developed. This higher strength is not applied for in this Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) but 
it is the formulation that has been used in the bioequivalence study between the pivotal clinical 
formulation and the proposed commercial formulation.   
The pharmaceutical development has generally been satisfactorily described and discussed. During 
formulation development, four different formulations have been used for clinical development. 
Lurasidone hydrochloride has low solubility and low permeability. The tablet compositions have been 
developed to provide optimal dissolution from the formulation. A discriminative dissolution method has 
been developed for routine testing and to enable comparison between different formulations. These 
have been compared with respect to dissolution characteristics when changes to the formulations were 
introduced. The pivotal clinical studies have been performed with one “Group formulation B”. When 
change to the “Group C” commercial formulation was made, a bridging bioequivalence study was 
conducted between the formulations. Comparative dissolution profiles in different media have been 
provided for the two formulations and for the different strengths of the commercial formulation. The 
dissolution data provided show dissolution profile similarity between Group B and Group C formulations 
and within Group C formulations.  
The development of the manufacturing process for the finished product has been sufficiently well 
described.  
The primary packaging is aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blister packs. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
The magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. None of the other excipients originates from human or 
animal sources.  
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured by a standard process consisting of the following main steps: wet 
granulation, drying, sizing, blending, compression and film-coating. Standard equipment is utilised. 
The three strengths are manufactured from a common granulate. The manufacturing process has been 
satisfactorily described and the in-process controls are considered adequate for this standard film-
coated tablet. The manufacturing process has been validated at commercial scale.   
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 11/147 
 
 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications for the tablets include appropriate tests for 
this kind of dosage form: description (visual), identification (HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), dissolution (Ph.Eur.) and microbial limits (ICH 
harmonised method). Analytical methods have been described and non-compendial methods have 
been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis data of production-scale batches (four batches for the 18.5 mg strength, seven for the 
37 mg strength and six for the 74 mg strength) have been provided confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Three production scale batches of each of the three strengths of the lurasidone film-coated tablets kept 
in the commercial packaging have been conducted under long term (up to 36 months, 25°C/60% RH) 
and accelerated (6 months, 40°C/75% RH) stability conditions according to ICH guidelines. Samples 
were tested for description, assay, organic impurities, dissolution, water content and microbial limits. 
No significant change has been observed in any of the parameters studied after accelerated and long 
term conditions and all batches complied with the specifications in all instances. The analytical 
procedures used were stability indicating. 
One batch of each strength has been subjected to photostability testing according to ICH Q1B 
guideline. The tablets proved to be stable towards light exposure with the exception of the 80 mg 
tablet which demonstrated some discolouration to light. 
Additionally, one batch of each strength was also subjected to stress conditions and to bulk storage 
stability studies. No significant change in any of the parameters tested was observed for samples 
subjected to heat and humidity and under bulk storage.  
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC are acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and controls applied to lurasidone hydrochloride and the 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The finished product is a standard 
dosage form manufactured by a standard manufacturing process. The results of the tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these lead in turn 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinical 
use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The standard battery of the pharmacology and toxicology studies were completed and submitted. 
All pivotal toxicity studies, including the safety pharmacology studies were performed in accordance 
with GLP principles, as declared by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Dopaminergic effects 
The ability of lurasidone to bind to dopamine receptor subtypes has been demonstrated in vitro in 
radio-ligand binding studies using receptors derived from rat striatum and human cultured cells.   
Lurasidone demonstrated high affinity in vitro for the human D2L receptors with Ki values of 0.329 and 
0.994 nmol/L in different cell preparations. The affinities for human D3 and human D4.4 receptors 
were lower, with Ki values of 15.7 and 29.7 nmol/L, respectively, and even lower for the rat D1-like 
receptor, with a Ki of 262 nmol/L. The two major human metabolites (ID-20129 and ID-20220) were 
without pharmacodynamic activity, while two other metabolites ID-14283 and ID-14326, showed 
affinities to dopaminergic receptors of similar magnitude as lurasidone.  
Lurasidone was effective with ED50 values ranging between 2.3 and 6.3 mg/kg p.o. in rodent animal 
models for dopamine receptor-mediated behavioural changes. A similar effect was demonstrated by 
other atypical antipsychotic compounds tested (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone). Metabolites 
ID-14283 and ID-14326 demonstrated similar dopamine mediating effects as lurasidone.  
The effects of repeated oral dose administration of lurasidone on dopamine mediated behaviour and on 
dopamine receptor sensitivity have been examined in rats in comparison with haloperidol. The results 
indicate that some D2 receptor supersensitivity is produced by repeated treatment with lurasidone, but 
substantially less than that produced by haloperidol. No supersensitivity of D1 receptors was noted 
after treatment with lurasidone which was seen after repeated dosing with haloperidol. 
Serotonergic effects 
Lurasidone showed high affinity in vitro for the human 5-HT7 (Ki values of 0.495 and 2.10 nmol/L), 
human 5-HT2A (Ki values of 0.470 and 0.357 nmol/L) and human 5-HT1A receptors (Ki=6.38 nmol/L). 
Regarding 5-HT2C receptors, only results from pig tissues are available, and in this species the affinity 
was relatively low (Ki=415 nmol/L). The two major human metabolites had no affinity for 5-HT 
receptors whereas a number of minor metabolites demonstrated affinity in a similar range as 
lurasidone. Functional assays demonstrated that lurasidone, ID-14283 and ID-14326, are partial 
agonists at human 5-HT1A receptors (35S-GTPγS binding) and potent antagonists at the human 5-HT7 
receptor (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] assay). Metabolites ID-20239 & ID-20240 are the 
diastereomers of the active metabolite ID-14283 and have similar binding affinities to rat 5-HT2 and 
D2-like receptors. There is no data related to relevant human receptors; however the safety profile for 
metabolite ID-14283 has been reviewed in the 39- and 52-week toxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, 
respectively. Exposure to ID-14283 in the dog at the NOAEL (30 mg/kg/day) were in excess of 8 times 
that achieved in humans, in the monkey (NOAEL <2 mg/kg/day) this was 0.06 times in excess to that 
achieved in patients given 160 mg lurasidone.

In vivo, lurasidone dose-dependently inhibited behavioural changes mediated by serotonin 5-HT2 
receptors in relevant rodent animal models, with ED50 values ranging from 2 to 6 mg/kg. Similar 
results were obtained for various reference drugs including compounds with other receptor profile than 
lurasidone. The three metabolites, ID-14283, ID-14326, and ID-11614, inhibited serotonin 5-HT2 
receptor-mediated behaviours in rodents in vivo with a slightly higher potency than lurasidone. 
However, these metabolites are only present to a small extent and are not considered to markedly 
contribute to the overall effect of lurasidone. 
Mood and cognition effects 
Lurasidone was evaluated for its antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects through a series of 
behavioural experiments including the conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behaviour test, Vogel 
water lick conflict test, the conditioned defensive burying test, and the social interaction test. 
Lurasidone prolonged the social interaction time spent by pairs of naive rats under brightly illuminated 
conditions in the social interaction test. The effect was statistically significant for 1 and 3 mg/kg and 
was similar to that observed for diazepam. Lurasidone was also able to selectively suppress the 
burying behaviour against the shock probe, in a dose dependent manner, at doses at which the 
locomotor activity was not affected (up to 6 mg/kg). 
The ability of lurasidone to affect learning and memory function was examined in the rat passive 
avoidance test. At oral doses up to 30 mg/kg it did not impair the learning or memory of male rats in a 
passive avoidance test. Lurasidone’s ability to alleviate the memory impairment induced by the NMDA 
antagonist, MK-801, in the rat passive avoidance test was examined and the results compared with 
those of 3 reference drugs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Oral administration of lurasidone 
(3 mg/kg) at 1 hour before the training session markedly reversed the effect of MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg) 
on both parameters tested (step-through latency and the percent of animals showing the maximal 
step-through latency). In comparison, risperidone and quetiapine only partially reversed the effect of 
MK-801 on the percent of animals displaying the maximal step-through latency but not on step-
through latencies and olanzapine failed to reverse the effect of MK-801 on either parameter. The 
effects of lurasidone on a muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine hydrobromide (scopolamine) 
induced memory impairment of passive avoidance task in rats were similar. Lurasidone treatment was 
also able to reverse the memory deficits produced by subacute treatment of rats with the NMDA 
antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) and then tested on a novel object recognition task. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Binding activity of lurasidone for noradrenergic receptor subtypes was evaluated in an in vitro binding 
assay. Lurasidone and its two active human metabolites showed a high affinity to the human α2C 
receptor and in contrast the two main human metabolites of lurasidone, ID-20219 and ID-20220, had 
negligible activity at this receptor.  
Secondary pharmacology of lurasidone covered studies to measure its ability to bind to off-target 
receptors or channels including: 5-HT3, 5-HT4, noradrenaline β, β1, β2, adenosine A1, A2, 
benzodiazepine, cholecystokinin CCKA, CCKB, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A, glutamate, α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-propionic acid (AMPA), kainate, NMDA, glycine, histamine H1, muscarine 
M1, M2, nicotine, opiate, sigma, L-type Ca2+ channel, N type Ca2+ channel, the A-type K+ channel, 
voltage gated K+ channel, the adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channel, 5-HT uptake 
sites, and dopamine uptake sites. Lurasidone showed little or no affinity to these channels or 
receptors.  
The potential of lurasidone to induce drug dependence was studied in rats and monkeys. Lurasidone 
appeared to be free of cross-physical dependence with barbital, and free of potential for physical

dependence formation. No reinforcing effect was noted with lurasidone, suggesting that this compound 
does not have the potential to induce psychic dependence. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacological effects of lurasidone were investigated on cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS 
function, as well as on autonomic nervous, endocrine, renal, gastrointestinal and smooth muscle 
systems. In addition safety pharmacology of a number of metabolites of lurasidone was provided, 
including ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-11614, ID-15001, and ID-15002.   
Cardiovascular System 
A complete battery of cardiovascular safety studies was performed to assess the effects of lurasidone 
and its 2 active metabolites, ID-14283 and ID-14326. The assessment included in vitro hERG assays, 
ex vivo studies in guinea pig and rat tissues, as well as in vivo studies in rats, guinea pigs, cats, and 
dogs. Furthermore, as part of the routine toxicologic evaluation ECG was performed in the toxicity 
studies in dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Lurasidone and the 2 active metabolites, ID-14326 and ID-14283 inhibited hERG currents at estimated 
IC50 values of 0.108, 0.676, and 0.821 μmol/L, respectively. A review of relative safety margins, 
comparing potential clinical exposure (Cmax) of free/unbound lurasidone, ID-14326 and ID-14283 to 
IC50 values revealed that safety margins were >100-fold for unbound molecule relative to the Cmax at 
a clinical dose of 160 mg administered for 6 days.  
In the safety pharmacology study in female dogs QTc prolongation was seen at 300 mg/kg 4, 6, and 
24 hours post-dose, with the NOEL at 100 mg/kg. At this dose, Cmax (1903 ng/mL) and AUC exposure 
(17000 ng*hr/mL) margins were 8.2- and 19-fold greater than human exposures at 160 mg 
lurasidone, respectively. 
ECG changes were also observed in the toxicology studies in dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys. In a non-
GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study QT/QTc prolongation occurred at the end of dosing in 1 male 
dog dosed with 300 mg/kg/day and was associated with the highest Cmax (2.615 μg/mL) and AUC 
(26.15 μg*hr/mL) values in this group. Examination of data from individual animals from the GLP 39-
week study revealed that the QT prolongation occurred (Weeks 13-39) in male dogs in which Cmax 
values exceeded 3.357 μg/mL, and AUC values exceeded 32.6 μg.hr/mL. There were no effects on the 
QT interval in female dogs in this study despite Cmax and AUC values up to 3.908 μg/mL and 42.3 
μg*hr/mL. Using the conservative threshold exposure values [Cmax (2.383 µg/mL); AUC (26.15 
μg*hr/mL)], margins relative to patients receiving 160 mg lurasidone were at least 10.2- and 29.1-fold 
greater than average human Cmax and AUC values, respectively. 
Furthermore transient increase in heart rate was observed in a monkey cardiotoxicity study (single 
dose 250 mg/kg), and a lack of night-time reduction in heart rate was observed in a dog cardiotoxicity 
study (2-week study, 50 mg/kg/day).  
Respiratory System 
There were no effects on the respiratory system (respiration rate, tidal volume, and minute volume) in 
conscious rats (up to 1000 mg/kg, oral) for lurasidone or its metabolites. Similarly, no effects on blood 
gas parameters (PO2, PCO2, and pH) in anaesthetised rats (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg, IV) were seen and 
there were no changes in the respiration rate of anaesthetised cats, or in anaesthetised and 
vagotomised cats (up to 100 µg/kg, IV).  
Central Nervous System

Lurasidone, when administered IV at high doses (up to 1 mg/kg), slowed spontaneous 
electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in rabbits, and inhibited the emetic response in APO-treated dogs 
following oral administration. No other potent effects on the CNS were seen (i.e., anti-acetylcholine 
action, anti-hypoxic action, effects on cerebral blood flow, convulsion facilitating action, and anti-
adrenergic action). 
Autonomic Nervous System 
Lurasidone and some of its metabolites had no or only marginal effect on the autonomic nervous 
system. 
Endocrine System 
Lurasidone increased serum prolactin levels at doses 1 mg/kg or more in rats, increased 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and corticosterone levels at doses of ≥3 
mg/kg. These effects were equal to or less than those observed for an oral dose of haloperidol at 3 
mg/kg. 
Urinary and Gastrointestinal System 
In the rat, lurasidone increased urinary volume but had no effect on the urinary electrolyte excretion at 
a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg. No effects on the urinary volume or the amount of electrolyte 
excretion were observed in the rat at a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg.  
Lurasidone had no effect on the digestive system in mice and rats at single oral doses of up to 100 
mg/kg.  
Smooth Muscle 
Lurasidone had a weak inhibitory effect on histamine-induced contractile response at 3 µg/mL, and 
inhibited noradrenaline-induced contraction at 0.03 μg/mL.   
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential interactions between lurasidone and haloperidol, diazepam, biperiden, imipramine, and 
carbamazepine were evaluated in rats and mice. Lurasidone and haloperidol potentiated the 
antidopaminergic activity of each other; however, lurasidone did not affect the cataleptogenic action of 
haloperidol. Lurasidone potentiated anxiolytic actions of diazepam but did not affect its muscle-relaxing 
actions. Lurasidone produced no obvious effects on the actions of other drugs. 
The antidopaminergic action of lurasidone was not affected by diazepam, biperiden, imipramine, or 
carbamazepine; these drugs also failed to affect the antiserotonergic actions of lurasidone. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
ADME studies to characterise the pharmacokinetic properties of lurasidone were performed in mice, 
rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys.  
Lurasidone is relatively rapidly absorbed with peak systemic exposure occurring within 5.3 hours of 
administration. The absolute bioavailability is low, <12%, in all species examined. Lurasidone 
absorption was higher in male Cynomolgus monkeys fed prior to drug administration, with time to 
peak exposure of 4 hours (vs. 5.3 hours), and the peak and total systemic exposure approximately 3-
fold higher. In rats and dogs, lurasidone doses above 10 mg/kg resulted in peak and total systemic 
exposure changes that were less than dose-proportional. Clearance ranged from 17 to 61 mL/min/kg 
and volume of distribution (Vdss) ranged from 2.4 to 20 L/kg. T1/2 was also variable with mean values 
ranging from 1.6 (monkey) to 27 hours (dog).

Tissue distribution of lurasidone was studied after single- and repeated-dose oral administration in 
rats. In addition, distribution studies were performed in pigmented and aged rats. Lurasidone 
distributed into most tissues including the brain; it also crossed the placenta and distributed into foetal 
tissues. Lurasidone bound to and was retained by pigmented tissues including the eye. Serum protein 
binding of lurasidone reached >99 %. 
Lurasidone is extensively metabolised with oxidative N-dealkylation, hydroxylation of the norbornane 
ring or cyclohexane ring, S-oxidation, reductive cleavage of the isothiazole ring followed by S-
methylation, and a combination of 2 or more of these pathways. Lurasidone is broken down into two 
non-major active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two major non-active metabolites, ID-
20219 and ID-20220, present systemically at levels >10%. ID-20219 and ID-20220 are also present 
systemically in humans at concentrations of >10% of the total radioactivity dosed; therefore can be 
defined to be the 2 ‘major’ human metabolites of lurasidone. Protein binding studies showed that these 
metabolites are highly bound to serum proteins (ID-14283 and ID-14326 bind ≥98.8% in human 
serum and ≥99.1% in dog serum). 
The route, extent, and metabolic profile of total radioactivity excreted in the form of the 14C-labeled 
lurasidone or its metabolites in urine, faeces, and bile has been examined in several animal studies. 
Radioactivity derived from labelled lurasidone was excreted after oral dosing, mostly within the first 24 
hours in mouse and rat and within the first 48 hours in rabbit, dog, and monkey. Following 
administration of [14C]lurasidone, the majority of the radioactivity (approximately 80% of dose) was 
excreted in faeces as the parent compound. As demonstrated in bile-duct cannulated animals, biliary 
excretion was a major excretion route of absorbed lurasidone. Based on the radioactivity excreted in 
urine and bile after oral administration, approximately 14%-48% of the orally administered dose was 
absorbed. Parent compound was detected only at trace levels in bile and urine, indicating that 
lurasidone, once absorbed, is subject to extensive metabolism. Many products of the major metabolic 
pathways were excreted into bile and/or urine. Major metabolites observed in the urine of mice and 
rats were ID-15002 and ID-20220 and those of dogs and monkeys were ID-15001 and ID-20220. In 
bile, the metabolite profiles in rats, dogs, and monkeys differed. In rat, dioxy-M21 isomers, ID-14283, 
and M22 were the main metabolites; in dogs, dioxy-ID-14324/dioxy-ID-14323, ID-20219, and the 
glucuronide of ID 20219; in monkey, dioxy-ID-14324 isomers and di-, tri- and tetra-oxidised 
derivatives. 
Lurasidone was excreted into milk. Following oral administration of [isothiazolyl-3-14C]lurasidone to 
lactating rats, 14C was found in milk during the 24 hours after dosing at concentrations significantly 
greater than those in serum (23.1% at 0.5 h, declining to 9.2% at 24h). The greatest mean 
radioactivity concentration in serum was 0.448 μg equivalents/mL measured at 1 hour after dosing. 
During the first eight hours after administration, a large proportion of the total radioactivity collected in 
the milk was the parent compound, lurasidone (71-78%). 
Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were explored for lurasidone. Due to the high level of protein 
binding observed with lurasidone, the potential for it to displace other co-administered drugs such as 
biperiden, flunitrazepam, haloperidol, or diazepam or vice versa was determined in vitro, although no 
changes to protein binding was seen. Metabolism of lurasidone was markedly reduced by ketoconazole, 
a known CYP3A4 inhibitor.

in the liver and slight focal hepatocyte atrophy (male) at 2000 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies were performed in mice (for up to 13 weeks), rats (for up to 26 
weeks), dogs (for up to 39 weeks) and monkeys (for up to 52 weeks). They included toxicokinetic 
analysis and were conducted in full compliance with GLP regulations.

* Major adverse findings are included in the table. All the effects are statistically significant, unless otherwise stated 
The main toxic effects observed in the repeated dose studies involved the CNS and the endocrine 
systems. In all tested species, clinical signs such as decreased spontaneous activity and tremors were 
observed. In addition, somnolence was observed in dogs. For mice and dogs no no-effect-level could 
be determined for these effects. In monkey, effects such as decreased spontaneous activity, tremors 
and vomiting were observed at low doses (2 mg/kg/day at 0.03 fold of clinical exposure). Furthermore, 
decreased body weights were observed in all studies. 
Levels of serum prolactin were increased in all species and at all tested doses. Changes on endocrine 
organ weights were observed in all tested animals. Prostatic changes were seen only in dogs, vaginal 
changes were observed only in rodents, whereas pituitary changes were seen in rodents and monkeys. 
Bone marrow and reduced bone density were seen in rats, but were not observed in mice. There was 
also a decrease in amount of trabecular bone in male dogs. Furthermore, in dogs effects on the thymus 
were observed after 4- and 39-week treatment. The majority of these effects were considered to be 
related to the increased prolactin levels in animals treated with lurasidone. All effects observed in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies were reversible except for the histopathologic changes in the femur and 
changes in the bone density in rats.   
QT prolongation was observed in the 4- and 39-week dog toxicology studies; for further discussion 
refer to the section on Safety Pharmacology.

A complete battery of in vitro and in vivo studies has been conducted and shows that lurasidone is not 
genotoxic. 
The mutagenic potential of one metabolite, ID-11614, and the impurity ID-15398 were evaluated in 
vitro in Ames test. The conclusion from the studies was that ID-11614 and ID-15398 were not 
mutagenic under the test conditions.  
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term GLP carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats administered lurasidone by 
oral gavage at doses of 0, 30, 100, 300, and 1200/650 mg/kg/day and 0, 3, 12, and 50/36 
mg/kg/day, respectively. Generally, the survival was low especially in female mice at the middle and 
highest dose (22%).  
In mice, the oral administration of lurasidone for 24 months caused increased serum prolactin at all 
dose levels administered (up to 1200/650 mg/kg/day), and increased the incidence of masses in the 
pituitary and the mammary glands of females. Vaginal mucification and vaginal, uterine, and cervical 
atrophy were also observed at these dose levels. An increase in the incidence of tumours in the pars 
distalis of the pituitary and in the mammary gland of females dosed at ≥30 mg/kg/day was also 
observed (x 1.3 of the clinical dose).  
In rats, the administration of lurasidone for 24 months at doses of 3, 12, and 50/36 mg/kg/day caused 
an increased incidence of mammary carcinomas in females dosed at ≥12 mg/kg/day (x 2.0 of clinical

dose), and increased milk secretion in males at all dose levels. Increases in the absence of corpora 
lutea in the ovary and in the cornification of the vagina were noted at all doses in females. The various 
lurasidone-related responses observed were considered to be related to the antagonism of dopamine 
type 2 receptors by lurasidone and typical effects of this class of drugs.

In the fertility and early embryonic development rat study, lurasidone administration decreased the 
number of implantations at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day and lowered fertility index (60% or 78%) at the 
same dose. The maternal effects at 150 mg/kg/day dose level included decreased body weight (up to 
12% compared to the control), prolonged oestrous cycle and slight decrease in number of corpora 
lutea. The effects on maternal body weight, food consumption and reproductive performance reversed 
in the 2-week recovery period prior to mating. No effects on fertility were observed in male rats.  
Neither lethal nor teratogenic effects on embryos or foetuses were observed at tested doses in 
teratology studies.  
In a pre and postnatal development study, pregnant rats (22/group) orally administered 4, 2, and 10 
mg/kg/day from Day 6 of gestation to Day 21 of lactation, no deaths or adverse clinical signs related 
to lurasidone administration were observed in any group. Maternal body weight gain was reduced in 
groups dosed at 10 mg/kg/day during the gestation period. No treatment-related effects were 
observed in the offspring.  
Toxicokinetic data

* The steady state Cmax and AUC(0-t) used in the margin calculations were 233 ng/ml and 899 ng h/ml, 
respectively. The values were from the Study D1050160 performed in subjects with schizophrenia following 160 mg 
daily dosing.  
In the toxicity studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, systemic exposure to lurasidone was achieved 
in all studies. Lurasidone exposures (Cmax and AUC) generally increased with dose. The safety 
margins were generally low and ranged from 0.0003 to 11.35.  
In 2-week toxicokinetic studies in mice, rats and dogs orally administered up to 650 mg/kg/day 
lurasidone, systemic exposure to lurasidone and ID-20219 but not ID-20220, generally increased with 
dose. In the 39- and 52-week toxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, respectively, orally administered 
up to 200 mg/kg/day, toxicokinetic analysis showed that animals were also exposed to the active 
metabolites ID-14283 and ID-14326. In the dog, the Cmax and AUC for all analytes increased dose-
dependently except for ID-14326 in females. The NOAEL in dogs was considered to be <30 mg/kg/day.  
At week 39, the Cmax and AUC values for ID 14283 at the 30 mg/kg/day dose were >8 and >16 
times, respectively, that achieved in patients administered the MRHD of lurasidone at 160 mg. At week 
39, the Cmax values for ID 14326 at the 30 mg/kg/day dose were >75 and >104 times that achieved 
in patients administered the MRHD of lurasidone at 160 mg. In monkeys ID-14283 increased with 
increasing lurasidone dose. In the 52-week study, the NOAEL was considered to be <2 mg/kg/day. At 
week 52, the Cmax values for ID 14283 at the 2 mg/kg/day dose were 4.15 and 2.57 ng/mL in males 
and females, respectively. These exposures are 0.09 and 0.06 times that achieved in patients 
administered the MRHD of 160 mg lurasidone.

Local Tolerance  
Lurasidone caused allergic reactions after subcutaneous administration in guinea pigs. However, no 
antigenicity in animals was observed after oral administration.  
Other toxicity studies 
The potential phototoxicity of lurasidone was studied after a single oral administration of vehicle, 
lurasidone (100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg), or positive control (8-methoxypsoralen, 10 mg/kg) to 
Sprague-Dawley rats (5 males/group; 5 week of age). An additional group receiving 1000 mg/kg 
lurasidone served as the non-irradiated control group. All but the non-irradiated control group were 
irradiated with ultraviolet radiation at a dose of 10 J/cm2. No remarkable skin reaction or increase in 
ear thickness observed in lurasidone-treated or vehicle control groups. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
On the basis of a maximum recommended daily dose of 148 mg per patient, a market penetration of 
1% and the available set of data from Phase II, Tier A and Tier B testing, no relevant environmental 
concerns are apparent from the use of lurasidone provided the usual recommendations for disposal of 
unused drug are followed. Suitable wording is included in the product information.

In conclusion, lurasidone is not a PBT substance and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
A concern over the dose selection as well as the low systemic exposure in the reproductive toxicity 
studies and their validity for assessment of risk to humans was expressed by the CHMP. The applicant 
has compared the proposed NOAEL to the MRHD (maximum recommended human dose) based on 
body surface area without showing the detected systemic levels of the substance in the animals. This 
comparison was not considered to be completely relevant. Furthermore, dose range finding (DRF) 
studies were performed to determine the appropriate dose for the pivotal studies. However, although 
no teratogenic effects and very slight maternal toxicity (only changes in body weight gain or food 
consumption) were observed at 150 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively, 
the chosen doses for the pivotal studies were far lower than in the DRF studies (around x 6 and x 4 in 
rat and rabbit, respectively). In addition, according to the toxicokinetic data from the rat 2-week study 
(non-pregnant), the AUC in females was determined to be around 1000 ng hr/ml after 10 mg/kg/day 
of lurasidone, which is at the same level as the exposure after clinical dose. No AUC values were 
submitted for rabbits. The applicant was requested to present relevant information on the systemic 
exposure of pregnant rats and rabbits after luradosine administration and to discuss the validity of the 
teratogenicity and peri- and postnatal developmental studies in relation to the systemic exposure and 
the clinical dose. The applicant provided an extensive explanation concerning the rationale for dose 
selection in the pivotal embryo-foetal and peri- and post natal studies. In conclusion, although the 
CHMP agreed that the reproductive toxicity studies did not indicate any teratogenic effects of 
lurasidone at an exposure identical or below the MRHD, the committee felt that the teratogenic 
potential has not been fully evaluated by the studies provided, in particular the rabbit study, due to the 
uncertainties regarding exposure to the parent compound. Accordingly, the CHMP requested the MAH 
to address these concerns in the product information. Consequently, the information on margin 
between the animal NOAELs and the MRHD is described in the SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3. The 
mentioned sections (4.6, with reference to 5.3) also state the limitations of the reproductive toxicity 
studies with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal 
development. 
A number of findings of QT/QTc prolongation were observed in the non-clinical studies conducted in the 
dog and to some extent in the monkey. At the request of the CHMP the applicant has provided a 
summary and discussion of all available data from both species. The committee acknowledged that 
exposure data from monkeys was limited and the available data provided for low or no margins for 
safety to the human clinical dose. Given that the effects seen in the cardiac toxicity studies revealed 
limited or unknown toxicological significance the CHMP agreed that the conclusions on the potential for 
Latuda

Rev05.13 
Page 26/147 
 
 
 
 
lurasidone to cause QT/QTc prolongation should be based on the available clinical data (see Discussion 
on clinical safety, section 2.6.1)  
Dedicated cardiac toxicity studies in the dog and monkey were performed and two findings relating to 
an increase in heart rate in the monkey and a lack of nocturnal reduction in heart rate in a dog were 
identified. A further discussion of the toxicological significance of these findings has been provided by 
the applicant. The transient increase in heart rate observed in monkeys was seen in doses exceeding 
250 mg/kg/day, and no further changes in cardiac parameters were observed in these animals. On the 
other hand, clinical findings showed slight changes in heart rate following dosing with lurasidone at 120 
mg and 600 mg, although these changes were inconsistent. The applicant’s argument that the finding 
in monkeys may have been related to D2/D3 receptor binding by lurasidone in the monkey brain may 
seem plausible. The CHMP agreed that the change in nocturnal heart rate seen in the dog cardiac study 
may have been due to the variability in animals, as only one animal was affected and such change was 
not observed in the other two treated animals. The lurasidone effect on the QT interval is reflected in 
the risk management plan (RMP) and will be monitored as a part of the requested post authorisation 
safety study (PASS).  
Major findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies of lurasidone were centrally-mediated endocrine changes 
resulting from serum prolactin elevations in rats, dogs and monkeys. High serum prolactin levels in 
long-term repeat-dose studies in female rats were associated with effects on bones, adrenal glands, 
and reproductive tissues. In a long-term dog repeat-dose study, high serum prolactin levels were 
associated with effects on male and female reproductive tissues. Furthermore, the previously held 
assumption that prolactin-associated tumours in rodents are not relevant to humans has recently been 
challenged in the scientific literature (e.g. Harvey PW, J Appl Toxicol, 2012, 32:1-9). Therefore the 
applicant was asked to provide a thorough discussion regarding the neoplastic findings of the rat and 
mouse carcinogenicity studies and their potential relevance to humans. In the response, the applicant 
pointed out that clinical and epidemiologic studies conducted to date do not support a causal link 
between hyperprolactinaemia and breast cancer in humans. The CHMP agreed that prolactin played a 
different endocrinological role in rodents as compared to humans, and therefore the increase in 
mammary and pituitary gland tumours observed in the lurasidone carcinogenicity studies was 
considered to be a rodent-specific finding. The CHMP also agreed that there is currently no scientific 
consensus regarding a possible link between elevated prolactin levels and human breast cancer. 
However, despite the inconsistent results of various epidemiological studies, it was felt that it was not 
possible to completely rule out such a link. Accordingly, the CHMP felt that it would be important to 
closely monitor adverse events potentially related to prolactin increase in the clinic.  
The applicant has presented data from the clinical development program of lurasidone, showing that 
prolactin levels in women treated with lurasidone was generally lower than that in women treated with 
other antipsychotics. In clinical studies of up to 22 months with lurasidone, there were no 
hyperprolactinaemia-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of gynaecomastia, breast 
enlargement, breast tenderness, or infertility in any treatment group. The CHMP agreed with the 
applicant’s conclusion that available clinical data did not suggest an increased risk of human breast 
cancer in women treated with lurasidone. 
Potential for ophthalmic changes due to the lurasidone distribution and retention to the eye were 
further discussed by the applicant in response to the concern from the CHMP. The applicant argued 
that there were no indications of ophthalmic adverse findings in the long term toxicology studies, 
which could support the understanding that findings for melanin binding was not indicative of ocular 
toxicity. The committee accepted the applicant’s argumentation. 
Due to inadequacies in the characterisation of the human metabolic profile for lurasidone further 
discussion on its complex metabolism was provided by the applicant. Exposure of additional key known 
Latuda

Page 27/147 
 
 
human metabolites ID-20221, ID-20222, Hydroxy-keto-ID-15002, ID-15001 and ID-14324 has been 
extrapolated from the existing mouse, rat and dog ADME studies, in which animals were treated with 
50 mg/kg lurasidone. Results were then converted to the extrapolated levels at which these 
metabolites could be present at the higher doses used in the toxicity studies. The CHMP expressed 
concern that this extrapolation was based on assumption of linear dose-concentration relationship for 
each of the three non-clinical species, which was shown not to be the case for mice and rats. Therefore 
the applicant was requested to provide further justification for extrapolating the levels of exposure of 
the known metabolites: ID-20221, ID-20222, Hydroxy-keto-ID-15002, ID-15001 and ID-14324 in the 
non-clinical species using AUC values obtained from the single dose pharmacokinetic studies (mice, 
rats and dogs). The committee also felt that further evidence to demonstrate that exposure to these 
metabolites was adequately covered in animals might be necessary to validate such approach. The 
Applicant used multiple extrapolation methods to provide further information on toxicological coverage 
of known and unknown metabolites. The CHMP acknowledged the limitation of the analysis however 
found it acceptable.  
Additionally, the points for clarification comprising the pharmacological activity of metabolites ID-
20239 & ID-20240 and using two non-rodent species in the toxicological package have all been 
resolved. 
According to the environmental risk assessment (ERA) lurasidone was originally proposed to be 
classified as a PBT substance based on the following rationale: when using normalised lipid content of 
5%, the resulting bioconcentration factor (BCF) was greater than 2000 (BCF: 2798-2585) indicating 
that lurasidone hydrochloride is bioaccumulative. The substance does not fulfil the T-criterion based on 
the data from ecotoxicity studies as specified in Reach Regulation Annex XIII section 1.1.3 (a), since 
NOECs from long-term studies on three trophic levels are above the cut-off value of 0.01 mg/L. 
However, lurasidone was considered to fulfil the category 2 criterion for a reproductive toxicant, 
according to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (CLP). This classification of lurasidone was based on 
prolactin-related effects not only in rodents but also in non-rodents, as well as some effects on male 
reproductive organs in dogs. After further discussion, taking into account data from clinical trials 
showing that prolactin levels in lurasidone-treated women were generally lower than those in women 
treated with other antipsychotics, the CHMP considered that lurasidone does not fulfil the T-criterion. 
Accordingly, when looking at the totality of the data they are not considered robust enough to classify 
lurasidone as a PBT substance. Hence, lurasidone is not considered to be a concern to the environment 
and no special warnings are necessary in the SmPC, labelling and patient leaflet. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion the non-clinical data provided were considered sufficient together with additional 
measures as specified in the discussion section to support this dossier.

In addition to the completed studies in subjects with schizophrenia there were ongoing studies at the 
time of submission. D1050238 is a randomised withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
which has the objective of studying the long-term maintenance of effect and safety of lurasidone. 
There is also a short-term Japanese study, D1001056 and its open-label safety extension, D1001057.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The information on clinical pharmacology of lurasidone was collected from 31 clinical studies and 14 in 
vitro studies with human materials. Thirty phase I trials, in a total of 671 subjects, have been 
completed to investigate the clinical pharmacology of lurasidone. Of these subjects, 371 subjects were 
healthy and 300 subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Furthermore, 
a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis has been performed using data pooled from several 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 31/147 
 
 
 
Phase I, II and III studies including in total 1623 subjects of which 1492 (92%) were patients with 
schizophrenia. 
Absorption  
At least 9-19% of lurasidone is absorbed after dosing in suspension form after food, based on the 
amount of radioactivity in urine in the two ADME studies (D1050184 and D1050262). The absolute 
bioavailability of lurasidone is unknown.  
The steady state Cmax and AUCtau in subjects with schizophrenia following 160 mg daily dosing in 
study D1050160 is 233.4 ng/mL and 899.3 ng*h/mL respectively. Based on the population modelling 
the steady state Cmax and AUCtau in the reference subject (80 kg white male) following 160 mg daily 
dosing is 122 ng/mL and 817 ng*h/mL respectively. In a female Asian subject the predicted Cmax and 
AUCtau is 138 ng/mL and 1420 ng*h/mL respectively. 
Absorption of lurasidone during fasting conditions is fairly rapid with tmax occurring at 1-3 hours after 
dose. The effect of a high fat/high calorie meal versus fasting conditions is an approximate 1.5- to 2-
fold increase in exposure, a 2- to 3-fold increase in Cmax and a delay of peak plasma concentration to 
about 4 hours as assessed in five food effect studies performed, both in healthy volunteers (S01P12, 
D1050251, D1001054) and in subjects with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder 
(D1050267 and D1050294). 
Based on these results it has been recommended in the SmPC section 4.2 that lurasidone should be 
administered with food. 
Distribution 
Lurasidone has a large apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F around 6000 L) and has a high protein 
binding (>99%). The active metabolite ID-14283 has a protein binding of >98%. The protein binding 
was considered of limited clinical relevance by the CHMP. 
Elimination 
Clearance of lurasidone (CL/F) derived from the population PK analysis is 196 L/h. The range of the 
terminal half-life is 20 hours to 40 hours.  
Lurasidone is converted to a large number of metabolites including active ID-14283, ID-14326, and 
inactive ones, i.e. ID-11614, ID-20219 and ID-20220 via multiple pathways. In vitro data and the 
drug-drug interaction studies with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) and rifampin (a CYP 
inducer) indicate that CYP3A4 is the main enzyme.  
Two studies, D1050184 and D1050262, examined the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of [14C]-
lurasidone after a single 40 mg oral suspension dose (150 µCi or 5.55 megabecquerel) was given to 5 
(D1050184) or 6 male subjects (D1050262) within 30 min of the start of a high fat meal. The results 
showed that between 67 and 80% of the substance was eliminated in faeces and 19 and 9% in urine 
resulting in a dose recovery of >85% in both studies, respectively. Faeces samples were only analysed 
in one of the studies and consisted almost entirely of unchanged lurasidone. The part of the dose 
excreted in urine was identified as metabolites and no unchanged lurasidone was identified in urine. 
Most of the radioactivity in faeces was recovered within 72 hours to 96 hours after administration of an 
oral dose. Based on results from study D1050184 the inactive metabolites ID-20219 and ID-20220 
were the main radioactive components in serum (24%, and 11%) except for parent lurasidone 
(10.7%). The active metabolite ID-14283 contributed to 2.8% of total radioactivity (up to about 30% 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 32/147 
 
 
of parent exposure). The other identified and unknown metabolites contributed to less than 10% of the 
total radioactivity in serum. The radioactivity data presented was based on 8 hour sampling time.  
Inter-individual variability (IIV) in Cmax and AUC was moderate in healthy volunteers (46% and 35% 
respectively) and slightly higher in patients with schizophrenia (54% and 63% respectively). Intra-
individual/inter-occasion variability (IOV) has not been determined.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Lurasidone demonstrated a linear PK profile at doses of 10 mg to 100 mg in healthy subjects (Study 
D1050001) and at doses of 120 mg to 160 mg in subjects with schizophrenia (Study D1050160). 
Based on the PopPK data there were no clear time-dependencies in lurasidone PK. The 
parent/metabolite (ID-14283) ratio seemed to be unaffected by repeat dosing and was found to be 
similar between patients and healthy volunteers. 
Special populations 
The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone has been investigated in healthy volunteers and in the patients. 
Generally no differences were identified except in higher inter-subject variability as mentioned above. 
The effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on the single dose pharmacokinetics of postprandial, 
orally-administered lurasidone 40 mg was investigated in D1050265. This was an open-label, single 
dose, oral administration study of lurasidone 40 mg in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment including matched healthy controls. An approximate 1.5-fold increase in exposure and 
maximal concentrations of lurasidone was observed in mild renal impairment; in moderate and severe 
the increase in exposure and maximal concentrations was approximately two-fold.  
The effect of hepatic impairment on lurasidone and the metabolite ID-14283 and ID-14326 was 
investigated in 15 subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment administered a single dose of 
20 mg (D1050264). Compared to healthy matched control subjects, the mean AUC0-inf increased 1.5-, 
1.7- and 3-fold for mild, moderate, and severe impairment groups, respectively. 
The effect of race on the PK of lurasidone was evaluated in a population PK study. It was found that 
Asian race was associated with a 47% increase in exposure compared to the reference covariate value 
(Caucasian race).  
Two studies evaluated the effects of age on lurasidone pharmacokinetics. D1001049 investigated the 
effect of age in Japanese subjects (aged, 20 to 32 years, inclusive and 65 to 79 years, inclusive); and 
D1050253 in Caucasian subjects (aged 65 to 85 years, inclusive). The results were compared with 
historical data from healthy young subjects (D1050250) given the same dose of lurasidone under 
similar fed conditions. The results from both studies showed a mean increase in exposure of up to 22% 
with a potential decrease in the rate of absorption. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The in vivo interaction potential of lurasidone was investigated in seven drug-drug interaction studies.  
Co-administration of lurasidone at 10 mg with multiple doses of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) 
resulted in a large increase in maximum concentration (7-fold) and exposure (9-fold) of lurasidone 
(D1050183). The administration of the multiple doses of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor diltiazem at 240 
mg resulted in a two-fold increase in lurasidone Cmax and AUC (lurasidone administered at 20 mg) in 
study D1050250.

When administered at the dose of40 mg with the single dose of the CYP enzyme inducer rifampin at 
600 mg more than 5-fold reduction of Cmax and AUC of lurasidone was observed in study D1050270.  
The pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam was only marginally affected by co-
administration of single- and multiple-dose of lurasidone (120 mg) (D1050269). 
Lurasidone showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the oral contraceptive Ortho Tri Cyclen 
(D1050246), lithium (D1050247) and the P-gp substrate digoxin (D1050279).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
The plasma protein binding of lurasidone was determined using equilibrium dialysis at 100, 300 and 
1000 ng/mL (SMT/01). The binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 
(AAG) was specifically studied. The protein binding of lurasidone in humans was 99.8 %, independent 
of concentration. A high degree of protein binding of lurasidone was also noted for HSA and AAG, 
≥99.1 and ≥99.6 % respectively. The plasma protein binding of the two active metabolites ID-14283 
and ID-14326 was determined in vitro in study NA04101 by using equilibrium dialysis at 10, 30 and 
100 ng/mL. The protein binding in humans was between 98.8 %-99.0 % for the two metabolites, 
independent of concentration.  
Protein binding displacement was investigated between lurasidone and concomitant drugs administered 
intravenously (biperiden, flunitrazepam, haloperidol and diazepam) in human serum Study X1K01. It 
was concluded that the protein binding of lurasidone was not affected by concomitant drugs and that 
protein binding of concomitant drugs was not affected by lurasidone.  
The inhibition of lurasidone metabolism was studied in human liver microsomes using 4 concomitant 
drugs (biperiden, flunitrazepam, haloperidol, and diazepam), which are substrates of CYP3A4, as well 
as the inhibition of metabolism of these drugs by lurasidone (Study X1K02). No inhibition of lurasidone 
metabolism by the 4 studied concomitant drugs (≤1 μg/mL) was observed. Similarly, no inhibition was 
observed by lurasidone across a range of concentrations (0.1 μg/mL-10 μg/mL) on the metabolism of 
the 4 studied concomitant drugs. The inhibition of lurasidone metabolism was further examined in 
human liver microsomes using 3 concomitant drugs (ketoconazole, quinidine and cimetidine, Study 
X1K02). The inhibitions associated with quinidine and cimetidine on the metabolism of lurasidone were 
negligible (Study X1K02). In the presence of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the metabolism 
of lurasidone was inhibited (X1K02). This finding was also demonstrated in Study A02001 which 
revealed an inhibition constant (Ki) of 37 nmol/L for ketoconazole.  As a consequence a clinical DDI 
study was performed. 
Two studies (6645-128 and PK007) investigated the reversible and irreversible inhibitory potential of 
lurasidone on CYP-mediated reactions was assessed in human liver microsomes. Lurasidone had low 
inhibitory effects on CYP2C9, CYP2D6 with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of >50 
μM. The Ki values for CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were 10 μM and 17 μM, respectively. No evidence of 
irreversible inhibition of CYP activity was observed in this study. Lurasidone was also shown to have 
weak inhibitory effects on CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6, and activities with IC50 
values of 6.3, 7.4, 5.9, 22 and 21 μM, respectively. Its IC50 values for the other CYPs tested were 
much higher; 90 μmol/L for 2D6 and >100 μmol/L for 1A2 and 2E1. Compared with lurasidone, its 
non-major active metabolite (ID-14283) demonstrated a similar or weaker inhibitory effect on CYP-
mediated reactions, as did the major, non-active metabolite ID-20219.  
Study XT093011 assessed the induction potential of lurasidone on CYP enzymes. Treatment with 
lurasidone (0.03, 0.3, 3, and 10 μM) once daily for 3 consecutive days in cultured fresh human 
hepatocytes had neither an inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 enzyme activity nor an 
effect on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. The CYP inducers (omeprazole 100 μM,

Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 34/147 
 
 
phenobarbital 750 μM and rifampin 10 μM) caused increases of 37.2-, 14.9-, and 6.74-fold in CYP1A2, 
2B6, and 3A4/5 activity, respectively. 
Studies PK003 and GE-0535-G examined the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) 
transport relationships of lurasidone and its metabolites (ID-14283 or ID-20219). In LLC-PK1 cells 
expressing the mouse and human P-gp, lurasidone and 1 of its active metabolites, ID-14283, did not 
exhibit vectorial transport, indicating that they are not substrates of P-gp. In LLC-PK1 cells expressing 
the human P-gp, lurasidone demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the digoxin transport activity at a 
concentration of 1 to 10 μM (IC50=1μM), while its major metabolite ID-20219 has no inhibitory effect 
on the digoxin transport activity up to 20 μmol/L. As a consequence a clinical DDI study was 
performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lurasidone is a selective blocking agent of dopamine and monoamine effects. Lurasidone binds 
strongly to dopaminergic D2- and to serotonergic 5-HT2A and5-HT7- receptors with a binding affinity 
of 0.994, 0.47 and 0.495 nM, respectively. It also blocks α2c-adrenergic receptors and α2a-adrenergic 
receptors with a binding affinity of 10.8 and 40.7 nM respectively. Lurasidone also exhibits some 
partial agonism at the 5HT-1A receptor with a binding affinity of 6.38 nM. Lurasidone is not bound to 
cholinergic or muscarinic receptors. 
Lurasidone doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg administered to healthy subjects produced a dose 
dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate, 
putamen and ventral striatum detected by positron emission tomography (see below). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology of lurasidone was investigated in two clinical studies. 
Study D1050180 was an open-label, single-centre, PET scan study that assessed 20 healthy Caucasian 
male subjects who were administered a single oral dose of lurasidone 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg 
and 80 mg. The study was designed to determine the dopamine D2 receptor occupancy of lurasidone 
using PET scans with the radioactive tracer [11C] raclopride. 
The results for each dose group were similar among all 3 striatal regions (caudate, putamen, globus 
pallidus) of the brain that were examined. Mean D2 receptor occupancies for the 3 brain regions 
ranged from 41.3%-43.3% (10 mg), 51.0%-54.8% (20 mg), 63.1%-67.5% (40 mg), 77.4%-84.3% 
(60 mg), and 72.9%-78.9% (80 mg). A relationship between serum concentration and D2 receptor 
occupancy was demonstrated for lurasidone, which showed that maximal D2 receptor occupancy 
(80%) was observed at lurasidone doses of 60 mg and 80 mg doses of lurasidone. 
Another PET study (D1050268) evaluating lurasidone occupancy at steady-state at doses up to 160 mg 
was being conducted at the time of assessment. In this investigator-initiated exploratory study, the 
results showed that dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in all examined brain regions was significantly 
correlated with serum concentration of lurasidone. 
Study D1001013 was a randomised, double-blind, single-centre, single dose per period, crossover 
study designed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of lurasidone 20 mg and 40 mg, or matching 
placebo, on the CNS penetration in 44 healthy, Japanese, adult males, using quantitative EEG and the 
flicker test. In quantitative EEG evaluation, in comparison with placebo, lurasidone did not affect global 
field power (GFP, %) in frequency bands: delta, theta, beta 2, or beta 3 at a dose of 20 or 40 mg. A 
Latuda

mildly increased GFP (%) in the alpha 1 (lower alpha-wave region) band and mildly decreased GFP (%) 
in the alpha 2 (higher alpha-wave region) and beta 1 bands were observed at a dose of lurasidone 40 
mg, although not significantly. In the flicker test, lurasidone significantly decreased the threshold of 
flicker discrimination at doses of 20 and 40 mg. A similar inhibitory effect has been reported with many 
antipsychotic agents. 
A thorough QTc (TQT) study (D1050249) was conducted in subjects with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorders. A concentration-response model was developed in order to provide a direct 
estimate of drug-induced QTc prolongation. According to the ICH E14 guideline, the thorough QT study 
(TQT) was considered inconclusive (drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by more than 5 and 
less than 20 ms; see clinical safety discussion on section 2.6). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The exposure to lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 is sufficiently characterised in healthy 
volunteers and patients with schizophrenia.  
Dose-proportional increase in exposure to lurasidone and ID-14283 is seen over a large dose range 
encompassing the therapeutic doses. High fat/high calorie food increases the exposure to lurasidone 2-
fold. Therefore lurasidone was administered with food in phase 2 and 3 studies.  
The CHMP agreed that the lack of an absolute bioavailability study can be accepted given the poor 
solubility, and thus the inability to administer lurasidone intravenously. However, the committee felt 
that the unknown bioavailability of lurasidone may hamper the assessment of its pharmacokinetics. 
Therefore the applicant was requested to use existing pharmacokinetic data to estimate product’s 
bioavailability. In their response the applicant submitted an estimate based on mass-balance data and 
PBPK modelling. The estimated value ranged from 6% to 18% and was consistent with the non-clinical 
data. The CHMP requested further comparisons and simulations pertinent to the potential CYP 
mediated DDIs and multiple dosing. Based on the provided results the committee considered that 
although the PBPK modelling could be improved in vivo data provided enough information for dosing 
recommendations.  
The protein binding of lurasidone and the active metabolite ID-14283 is high; hence the CHMP felt that 
this may affect their active moieties. Consequently, the applicant was requested to calculate the 
respective active moieties of lurasidone and ID-14283 in scenarios where changes in lurasidone/ID-
14283 exposure ratio and protein-binding could be expected, e.g. the ketoconazole study and the 
hepatic impairment study. The calculations revealed that the changes were consistent with the PK 
results presented in the ketoconazole, rifampicin, diltiazem drug-drug interaction studies and the renal 
and hepatic impairment studies. According to the calculations provided the metabolite ID-14283 seems 
to have a major contribution to the lurasidone activity. This information is reflected in the relevant 
sections of the SmPC.  
Two mass-balance studies have been performed for lurasidone and have provided information on the 
pharmacokinetics of lurasidone and its metabolites. Due to inadequacies in the design of mass-balance 
studies and uncertainties in the interpretation of the results, the applicant was asked to submit more 
detail regarding the metabolism and elimination of lurasidone. Furthermore, additional data, analyses 
and discussions to address the concern regarding the risk of unanticipated DDIs as a result of 
unidentified major metabolites of lurasidone were requested. The applicant has provided requested 
analyses and discussions based on the available data together with additional estimation of the likely 
exposure to the unknown metabolites providing therefore enough reassurance on the safety 
implications of the PK of the product.  
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 36/147 
 
 
It was also concluded that the elimination of ID-14283, via metabolism/active transport, should be 
further investigated in vitro due to its substantial contribution to efficacy. The applicant provided in 
vitro data to investigate the metabolism of ID-14283 and also committed to the post-authorisation 
measure to study ID-14283 as a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and to update SmPC wording 
accordingly. 
CYP3A5 is known to exhibit polymorphism. Additionally, the CHMP noted that Asian population 
appeared to have higher exposure to lurasidone on average than Caucasians. Therefore, the applicant 
was requested to determine the contribution of CYP3A5 to the metabolism of lurasidone and discuss 
the potential consequences of genetic polymorphism. In response, the applicant provided the re-
assessment of the clearance data from the clinical development program. The analysis indicated that 
CYP3A5 did not contribute significantly to the clearance of lurasidone and that genetic polymorphism of 
the enzyme would not be expected to impact its metabolism. 
The CHMP noted that patients with creatinine clearance below 15 ml/min have not been investigated 
during the clinical development programme. Therefore the applicant was asked to discuss how the 
lurasidone PK was affected in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The applicant used the 
available data from the renal impairment study (D1050265) to estimate lurasidone PK in subjects with 
ESRD. The linear regression model was used to estimate lurasidone Cmax and AUC by extrapolation of 
CrCl values to 0-15 mL/min. Due to the large variability of the data the model did not however provide 
a reliable estimate. In addition, since no unchanged lurasidone was found in urine it was not possible 
to estimate the impact of ESRD on lurasidone PK based on elimination pathways. Therefore, the 
Committee concluded that lurasidone should not be used in patients with ESRD unless the potential 
benefits outweigh the potential risks. This information is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Other factors found to influence lurasidone exposure were hepatic impairment, gender and race. The 
exposure increase 3-fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, while the combination of Asian 
race and female gender were predicted to result in 75% higher exposure compared to a white male. 
The applicant discussed thoroughly potential differences in the efficacy and safety profile of lurasidone 
related to race and gender. The results of a population pharmacokinetic (PK) meta-analysis revealed 
no clinically relevant race-related differences in the PK of lurasidone. A small sex and race effect 
observed with an increase exposure of 1.2-fold for female subjects and 1.5-fold for Asian race, was 
considered not to be clinically relevant and therefore not necessitating a dose adjustment in Asian 
women. The applicant was requested to justify the proposed doses in patients with hepatic impairment 
and clarify whether there was a true gender/race effect on elimination capacity. The justification 
provided by the applicant to allow a lurasidone starting dose of 20 mg in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (SHI) was deemed acceptable by the CHMP. However, since the starting dose in SHI 
patients resulted in a higher exposure in SHI patients as compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function (NHF) caution was advised in these patients. Therefore the CHMP requested that this 
information should be reflected in section 4.4 in the SmPC.  
In consideration of the CHMP’s concern, the applicant re-examined the PopPK analyses and the results 
of this reanalysis emphasised Asian race as a parameter of more relevance to clearance than weight. 
The CHMP acknowledged the explanation provided. 
The CHMP noted that there were limited data for lurasidone pharmacokinetics in the elderly and that 
they were based on total drug concentrations. The two proteins that bind lurasidone in plasma change 
with age (albumin decreasing and α1-acid glycoprotein increasing). Given the very high degree of 
plasma protein binding of lurasidone and ID-14283 and the fact that pharmacokinetic studies 
measured only total drug, a potential change in free drug concentration may not have been detected. 
Consequently, the applicant was requested to discuss how age related changes in protein 
concentrations could affect the interpretation of total concentration when used as a surrogate for free 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 37/147 
 
 
concentration. The applicant presented additional analyses and simulations including popPK and the 
estimation of protein binding isotherms. The CHMP agreed with the applicant that the effect of age and 
protein binding on free lurasidone were not expected to impact the overall safety and efficacy in the 
elderly population. 
The in vitro data submitted on lurasidone and ID-14283 as P-gp substrates were inconclusive. As P-gp 
may be involved in the absorption and/or potential biliary excretion of lurasidone the applicant was 
asked to submit additional in vitro data. Based on the submitted results it was concluded that 
lurasidone interaction at P-gp/BCRP in the intestine was possible. The section 4.5 of the SmPC has 
been updated to reflect this finding and to include a list of clinically relevant P-gp substrates.  
Moreover, the results of the in vivo digoxin interaction study did not preclude inhibition of P-gp at the 
intestinal level. Consequently, the applicant was requested to discuss the potential impact of 
lurasidone on drugs that are substrates of intestinal P-gp transport and provide a justification for the 
lack of in vivo study with a sensitive substrate of intestinal P-gp (e.g. with dabigatran etexilate). In 
response the applicant emphasised that lurasidone had very low solubility at the pH of the small 
intestine which resulted in concentrations much lower than the IC50 reported for P-gp inhibition. The 
CHMP accepted the applicant’s justification for not performing the in vivo study. 
The Applicant was also requested to provide in vitro data on the inhibition of the transporters from 
studies ongoing in parallel to the assessment. Based on the submitted in vitro data lurasidone did not 
inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant 
concentrations. However, the inhibition of the P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 was observed in vitro. These 
findings have been reflected in the SmPC. The applicant will submit an in vitro study investigating the 
solubility of lurasidone in the fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FESSIF) post approval. 
The absence of the data on the binding of lurasidone to plastic in the in vitro studies has been deemed 
acceptable by the CHMP given the indirect evidence of minimal binding based on the linearity in the 
bioanalytical calibration curves. 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole leads to a major increase (9-fold) in exposure to lurasidone while 
induction of the same enzyme leads to a 6-fold decrease in exposure. Thus, the CHMP agreed to the 
recommendation that co-administration of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be 
contraindicated for patients taking lurasidone (reflected in SmPC section 4.3). The moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor diltiazem lead to a 2-fold increase in lurasidone Cmax and AUC and therefore the applicant 
recommended a starting dose of 20 mg and that the maximum dose of lurasidone should not exceed 
80 mg once daily in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (reflected in SmPC section 4.2).  
Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4. Since the potency and specificity of other inducers may differ 
from rifampin, the applicant was requested to discuss dosing recommendations that would apply when 
other inducers including mild/moderate ones are administered together with lurasidone. In their 
response the applicant concluded that mild and moderate CYP3A4 inducers may cause less than 2-fold 
reduction in lurasidone exposure. The CHMP felt that this may lead to lower treatment efficacy and 
therefore the recommendation needed to be included in the SmPC together with examples of mild and 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers. 
Data on lurasidone time dependent inhibition of CYP2C8 and 2B6 will be provided as a post-approval 
measure.  
The applicant provided an analysis of the efficacy in the White North American subgroup of patients in 
response to the CHMP request for an overview of the available information regarding the genetic 
differences in the PD response, in particular between the non-EU populations from the clinical 
development programme and the target EU patient population. In the CHMP’s view this analysis 
demonstrated no reduction in efficacy in one, potentially genetically distinct subgroup compared to the 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 38/147 
 
 
overall development programme population thus supporting the claim that genetic differences between 
the studied and the target population are not expected to have significant influence.  
Due to the heterogeneous patient population and methodological shortcomings in the Investigator-
initiated PET study D1050268, the CHMP felt that results were not directly applicable to the proposed 
product. Therefore the applicant was requested to present the results for the subgroup of patients with 
schizophrenia only and present the information on delay between the scan and the efficacy 
assessment. The applicant explained that the overall number of subjects in the study was small 
(n=17), and that only 10 subjects had diagnosis of schizophrenia making the subgroup analysis 
unfeasible. The delay between the scan and the PANSS assessment was within 2 days. The CHMP 
acknowledged the response and considered the issue as closed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Lurasidone is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4 leading to contraindication of both strong inhibitors 
as well as strong inducers of this enzyme. There is an active metabolite, ID-14283, that is likely to 
have a substantial contribution to the pharmacological effect. Increase in exposure to lurasidone has 
been observed in subjects with decreased hepatic and renal function which implicates the need of dose 
modifications in these patients. A number of uncertainties are expressed in relation to the clinical 
pharmacology (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). These issues are to be investigated post 
approval. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
1. 
MEA: An in vitro study to assess if the active lurasidone metabolite ID-14283 is a substrate of 
the liver uptake transporters (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3). The clinical relevance of the results should be 
assessed and further action may be required (included in RMP as Category 3).  
2. 
MEA: An in vitro study to investigate if lurasidone causes time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8 
and CYP2B6. The clinical relevance of the results should be assessed and further action may be 
required (included in RMP as Category 3).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
There were 12 short-term clinical studies altogether; five 6-week studies (Study D1050006, 
D1050196, D 1050229, D1050231 and D1050233), and 7 other studies including 2 active controlled 
studies (D1001002 and D1050049) and 3 uncontrolled studies (D1001001, D001016 and D1001017) 
included in the lurasidone development program.  
In all, there were 9 long-term studies reported in the application; 2 pivotal 12-month studies (Study 
D1050234 and D1050237) and another 7 long-term open-label clinical studies including three 6-month 
studies (D1050231E, D1050237E, D1050290), two 12-month studies (D1050199, D1001048) and one 
study of 22 months (D1050229E) to demonstrate maintenance of effect, tolerability and safety of 
lurasidone treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, the MAH submitted results from 
a long-term study D1050238 during the procedure. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study D1050160 aimed at establishing the maximum tolerated dose of lurasidone in patients with 
schizophrenia. 
This was a single-centre, inpatient, single-blind, fixed-dose, and sequential dose escalation study of 
the safety and tolerability of several doses of SM-13496 in subjects with schizophrenia. The doses 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 39/147 
 
 
administered were 120 mg, 140 mg and 160 mg. Each panel consisted of 8 different patients. If one 
dose level was found to be well tolerated the study progressed to the higher dose level. Minimum 
intolerable dose was defined as the dose at which 50% or more of the subjects experienced multiple 
moderate or severe adverse events, or the dose at which at least one subject experienced a serious 
adverse event at least possibly related to the study medication. The dose below would then be 
designated as the maximum tolerated dose. 
No clinically significant profile of toxicity was seen with lurasidone at 120 mg, 140 mg, or 160 mg 
taken once daily. The most frequently reported AEs were fatigue, restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia. 
The most frequently reported AEs considered drug-related were fatigue and restlessness. 
The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of lurasidone at doses of up to 120 mg in the treatment of adult 
subjects with schizophrenia was investigated in the study D1050006. This study will be described in 
more detail in section Supportive studies. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
There were 5 short-term 6-week, fixed dose, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo controlled 
studies (Study D1050006, D1050196, D 1050229, D1050231 and D1050233) designed to show 
superiority of lurasidone as compared to placebo at a dose range of 40 mg to 160 mg, and similar 
short-term clinical efficacy to that of two active comparators, olanzapine 15 mg and quetiapine XR 600 
mg, in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in adult patients with schizophrenia. They were submitted 
as pivotal trials for this application. 
Due to the high discontinuation rate or small size of two of the studies (D1050006, D1050196) CHMP 
considered them as supportive for this application. 
Short-term efficacy studies 
Short Term Efficacy Study D1050229 - Randomised, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial to 
Study the Safety and Efficacy of Three Doses of Lurasidone HCl in Acutely Psychotic Patients 
with Schizophrenia (Double-Blind Phase) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Adult male and female subjects in good physical health between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, who 
met DSM-IV™ criteria for a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia (including disorganised [295.10], 
paranoid [295.30], and undifferentiated [295.90] subtypes as established by clinical interview using 
the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI] Plus) were eligible for inclusion in this study. 
The duration of the subject’s illness, whether treated or untreated, must have been greater than one 
year. Subjects must have been experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (no longer 
than 2 months) and marked deterioration of function from baseline (by history), or have been 
hospitalised for the purpose of treating an acute psychotic exacerbation for two consecutive weeks or 
less immediately before screening. Subjects must have had a PANSS total score ≥80 at screening and 
baseline, with a score ≥4 (moderate) on two or more on the following PANSS items: delusions, 
conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations, unusual thought content, and suspiciousness. Subjects must 
also have had a score ≥4 on the CGI-S at screening and baseline. Subjects had to agree and be able to 
remain off prior antipsychotic medication for the duration of the study. Subjects could not be pregnant, 
nursing, or planning pregnancy within the projected duration of the study. Subjects of reproductive 
potential had to agree to remain abstinent or use two acceptable methods of birth control during the

study. Subjects had to test negative for selected drugs of abuse at screening and baseline (in the 
event a subject tested positive for cannabinoids [tetrahydrocannabinol] or alcohol, the investigator 
evaluated the subject’s ability to abstain from prohibited substances during the study). Subject needed 
to have a stable living arrangement for at least 3 months prior to randomisation and agree to return to 
a similar living arrangement after discharge. 
Treatments 
Subjects were evaluated for eligibility during a screening period of up to 14 days, during which they 
were tapered off all psychotropic medications. Subjects who met entry criteria entered a 3- to 7-day 
placebo washout period and remained hospitalised for the duration of the washout. 
Subjects were to take the study medication containing lurasidone (40 mg/day, 80 mg/day or 120 
mg/day) or matching placebo once daily in the morning by mouth with water, with a meal or within 30 
minutes after eating (e.g., bowl of cereal). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone (40, 80, or 120 mg/day) 
compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects with acute schizophrenia (diagnosed by Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. [DSM-IV™] criteria) after 6 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy in improving functional outcome after 6 weeks of 
treatment; evaluation of efficacy in improving symptoms of schizophrenia during first week of 
treatment; evaluation of lurasidone efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms after 6 weeks of 
treatment; evaluation of safety and tolerability of lurasidone in acutely schizophrenic subjects during 
the 6-week treatment phase. 
Tertiary objectives comprised evaluating the clinical relevance of lurasidone effects along with its 
effects on positive subscale, negative subscale and general psychopathology PANSS subscale.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcome measure was the mean change from baseline in the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6.

In addition a number of safety variables were followed and recorded, namely proportions of subjects 
with AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and SAEs. 
Sample size 
Expected improvements in PANSS ratings (and SD) were estimated from 2 prior studies of lurasidone, 
D1050006 and D1050196. Assuming lurasidone differed from placebo in the change from baseline in 
PANSS total score by 6.8, 8.0, and 10.0 for the 40, 80, and 120 mg/day doses, respectively, and 
further assuming a standard deviation of 19.1, then n=120 subjects per group provided 97.5% power 
(at the α=0.05 level, two-sided test) to reject the null hypothesis of no difference from placebo for at 
least 1 lurasidone dose. This power calculation incorporated Bonferroni’s procedure for controlling 
pairwise differences to placebo and was obtained via computer simulations. Therefore, the study 
planned to enrol 120 subjects per treatment group, for a total of 480 subjects. 
Randomisation 
Following the screening and washout periods, subjects who continued to meet entry criteria were 
randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms: Lurasidone 40 mg, Lurasidone 80 mg, Lurasidone 
120 mg, or placebo (1:1:1:1 ratio). 
Blinding 
Study personnel had access to an IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) to allocate subjects, to 
assign study medication to subjects, and to manage the distribution of clinical supplies. Each person 
accessing the IVRS was assigned an individual unique personal identification number (PIN). They were 
to only use their assigned PIN to access the system and were not to share their assigned PIN with 
anyone. The IVRS was to be used to unblind subjects and to unmask drug identity. Drug identification 
information was to be unmasked ONLY if necessary for the welfare of the subject. Every effort was to 
be made not to unblind the subject unless necessary. Any unblinding that occurred at a site was to be 
documented. 
Statistical methods 
Primary: The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 
6, as evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) under the assumption of an 
unstructured covariance matrix. The model included factors for pooled centre, time (including all 
scheduled post-Baseline visits, modelled as a categorical variable), baseline PANSS total score, 
treatment, and treatment-by-time interaction. The Kenward-Rogers method was used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The treatment and treatment-by-time interaction terms allowed for 
comparisons of the treatment groups at each of the scheduled time points. P-values for the comparison 
of Lurasidone doses versus placebo at Week 6 were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the 
Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure. The primary analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) population. The analysis was also conducted on the Per Protocol (PP) population.  
In a supportive analysis, the change from baseline in PANSS total scores at scheduled visits and Week 
6 last observation carried forward (LOCF) Endpoint were evaluated using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA), with effects for Baseline total PANSS score, pooled centre and treatment. 
Key Secondary: The first key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in CGI-S at Week 6 was 
evaluated using the same MMRM model used for the PANSS total score, was included in the Hommel-
based tree-gatekeeping procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons at Week 6. This was performed 
for the ITT and PP populations. The change from Baseline in CGI-S at scheduled visits and Week 6

Page 42/147 
 
 
LOCF Endpoint were also evaluated using ANCOVA, as supportive analysis, with effects for Baseline 
score, pooled centre and treatment. 
The second key secondary endpoint, the change from Baseline in PANSS total score at Day 4 was 
evaluated from the same repeated measures model that produced the Week 6 estimates, and it was 
included in the Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure.  
Other Efficacy: PANSS responder rates were evaluated with logistic regression. PANSS subscores and 
MADRS were evaluated using MMRM and a supportive ANCOVA. For each parameter, the p-values for 
Week 6 treatment comparisons versus Placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a 
Hommel procedure.

Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 26 October 2007; the last subject completed the double-blind phase 
on 15 December 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol dated 21 August 2007 was amended 4 times. None of the changes in any of the 
amendments negatively impacted subject safety or integrity of the data collected during the course of 
the study. 
Baseline data 
Of the 496 subjects (Safety population data set), 346 (70%) were male and 150 (30%) were female. 
Subject age ranged from 18 to 72 years, with a mean age of 39.0 years. The plurality of subjects was 
White (49%), followed by Black or African American (34%), and Asian (15%). Native Americans and 
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders made up less than 1% each of the Safety population. 
The majority of subjects were treated in North America (55%, all in the US), while 30% of subjects 
were treated in Europe and 15% of subjects were treated in Asia. 
Overall, the majority of subjects in the ITT population were diagnosed with paranoid-type 
schizophrenia (88%), followed by undifferentiated type (10%), and disorganised type (2%). Most of 
the subjects had 4 or more hospitalisations for schizophrenia. The average age (± SD) at initial onset 
of schizophrenia was 24.6 ± 8.3 years, with a range from 4 years to 57 years of age. The average age 
(± SD) at onset of the current episode of schizophrenia was 38.7 ± 10.5 years, with a range of 17 
years to 72 years of age. 
Psychiatric disorders, reported by 50% of subjects, was the most common class of pre-existing medical 
condition, including insomnia (43% of subjects), anxiety (32% of subjects), agitation (21% of 
subjects), and depression (11% of subjects). Other common pre-existing medical conditions by 
preferred term included: hypertension (14% of subjects), headache (11% of subjects), and drug 
hypersensitivity (6% of subjects). There were no meaningful differences between the treatment groups 
in the incidences of pre-existing medical conditions that might be expected to affect the interpretation 
of the safety or efficacy results.  
The most commonly used concomitant medications were anxiolytics (used by 69% of subjects in the 
40 mg group, 64% of subjects in the 80 mg group, 70% of subjects in the 120 mg group, and 61% of 
subjects in the placebo group) and hypnotics and sedatives (used by 41% of subjects in the 40 mg 
group, 40% of subjects in the 80 mg group, 45% of subjects in the 120 mg group, and 37% of 
subjects in the placebo group). The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory/antirheumatic products was 
also relatively common (used by 28% of subjects in the 40 mg group, 26% of subjects in the 80 mg 
group, 21% of subjects in the 120 mg group, and 24% of subjects in the placebo group). The use of 
anticholinergic agents increased with lurasidone dose (used by 14% of subjects in the 40 mg group, 
23% of subjects in the 80 mg group, 29% of subjects in the 120 mg group, and 8% of subjects in the 
placebo group). 
Numbers analysed 
For the double-blind phase, a total of 489 (98%) subjects were analysed for efficacy (Intent-to-Treat 
population) and 496 (99%) subjects were analysed for safety (Safety population) (see table above for 
more detail).

Outcomes and estimation 
Table 13: Change from Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score – 
Repeated Measures (Intent-to-Treat Population). 
When comparing 80 mg lurasidone with placebo, there was a statistically significant treatment effect 
(p=0.034) in PANSS total score change demonstrated. To be noted however, neither the 40 mg nor 
the 120 mg patient group was statistically different from placebo.  
One of the key secondary endpoints (CGI-S), showed a statistically significant difference favouring 
lurasidone 80 mg over placebo (Table 14).

Methods 
Study Participants  
The study recruited subjects between 18 and 75 years of age in good physical health (based on 
medical history, physical examination, and laboratory screening) who met DSM-IV criteria for a 
primary diagnosis of schizophrenia (including disorganised (295.10), paranoid (295.30), and 
undifferentiated (295.90) subtypes as established by clinical interview (using the Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI] Plus diagnostic interview). The duration of the subject’s illness, 
whether treated or untreated, must have been greater than one year. Subjects may have had an acute 
exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (no longer than 2 months) and marked deterioration of function 
from Baseline (by history) or subject had been hospitalised for the purpose of treating an acute 
psychotic exacerbation for 2 consecutive weeks or less immediately before screening. Subjects had a 
PANSS total score ≥80 at Screening and Baseline, with a score ≥4 (moderate) on 2 or more on the 
following PANSS items: delusions, conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations, unusual thought content, 
and suspiciousness. Subject had a score ≥4 on the CGI-S at Screening and Baseline. Subject had to 
test negative for selected drugs of abuse at Screening and Baseline. Subject could not be pregnant 
(must have had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening) or nursing (must not have been 
lactating) and was not planning pregnancy within the projected duration of the study. A subject who 
was of reproductive potential must have agreed to remain abstinent or use adequate and reliable 
contraception throughout the study. Subject had to be able and agreed to remain off prior 
antipsychotic medication for the duration of the study. Subject had to have a stable living arrangement 
for at least 3 months prior to randomisation and agree to return to a similar living arrangement after 
discharge.  
Treatments 
Subjects who met entry criteria were to enter a 7-day placebo washout period during which they were 
not to receive any active antipsychotic medication. Subjects were to remain hospitalised for the 
duration of washout. During the washout period, subjects were to receive single-blind placebo for 7 
days. Subsequently subjects were to be randomised to the acute treatment phase and were to receive 
blinded study medication containing lurasidone (40 mg/day or 120 mg/day) or olanzapine capsules or 
matching placebo. Subjects were eligible for hospital discharge after completing 21 days of double-
blind treatment. All medication was to be taken once daily in the morning by mouth with a meal or 
within 30 minutes after eating (e.g., bowl of cereal), and with water.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone (40 mg/day or 120 mg/day) compared 
with placebo in subjects with acute schizophrenia (diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. [DSM-IV™] criteria).  
Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy in improving functional outcome after 6 weeks of 
treatment; evaluation of efficacy in improving symptoms of schizophrenia during first week of 
treatment; evaluation of lurasidone efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms after 6 weeks of 
treatment; evaluation of safety and tolerability of lurasidone in acutely schizophrenic subjects during 
the 6-week treatment phase. 
Tertiary objectives comprised evaluating the clinical relevance of lurasidone effects along with its 
effects on positive subscale, negative subscale and general psychopathology subscale of PANSS. In

addition, the efficacy of olanzapine (15 mg per day) compared with placebo in subjects with acute 
schizophrenia (diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria) was also evaluated for assay sensitivity purposes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints included the mean change from Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6.

In addition a number of safety variables were followed and recorded, namely proportions of subjects 
with AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and SAEs. 
Sample size 
Expected improvements in PANSS ratings (and SD) were estimated from 2 prior studies of lurasidone, 
D1050006 and D1050196. Assuming lurasidone differed from placebo in the change from Baseline in 
PANSS total score by 6.8 and 10.0 for the 40 and 120 mg/day doses, respectively, and further 
assuming a SD of 19.1, then n=120 subjects per group provided 97% power (at the α=0.05 level, two-
sided test) to reject the null hypothesis of no difference from placebo for at least one lurasidone dose. 
This power calculation incorporated Bonferroni’s procedure for controlling pairwise differences with 
placebo and was obtained via computer simulations. Therefore, the study planned to enroll 120 
subjects per treatment group, for a total of 480 subjects. 
Randomisation 
Following the screening and washout periods, subjects who continued to meet entry criteria were 
randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms: Lurasidone 40 mg, Lurasidone 120 mg, Olanzapine 
15 mg or placebo (1:1:1:1 ratio). 
Blinding  
Study personnel had access to an IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) to allocate subjects, to 
assign study medication to subjects, and to manage the distribution of clinical supplies. Each person 
accessing the IVRS was assigned an individual unique personal identification number (PIN). They were 
to only use their assigned PIN to access the system and were not to share their assigned PIN with 
anyone. The IVRS was to be used to unblind subjects and to unmask drug identity. Drug identification 
information was to be unmasked ONLY if necessary for the welfare of the subject. Every effort was to

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol dated 18 December 2007 was amended 2 times. None of the changes in any of 
the amendments negatively impacted subject safety or integrity of the data collected during the course 
of the study. 
Baseline data 
Of the 475 subjects in the Safety population, 371 (78%) were male and 104 (22%) were female. 
Subject age ranged from 18 to 68 years, with a mean age of 37.7 years. The plurality of subjects was 
White (36%), followed by Black or African American (34%), and Asian (24%). Native Americans and 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders made up less than 2% of the Safety population. No 
meaningful differences were observed between the treatment groups for any of the demographic 
variables. The majority of subjects were treated in North America (60%, all in the US), while 24% of 
subjects were treated in Asia (India and the Philippines), 10% in South America (Columbia), and 6% in 
Europe (Lithuania). 
Overall, the majority of subjects in the ITT population were diagnosed with paranoid-type 
schizophrenia (86%), followed by undifferentiated type (10%), and disorganised type (4%). Almost 
half of the subjects (48%) had 4 or more hospitalisations for schizophrenia. The average age (± SD) at 
initial onset of schizophrenia was 23.8 ± 8.2 years, with a range from 6 years to 55 years of age. The 
average duration (± SD) of the current episode of schizophrenia (from onset to randomisation) was 
34.0 ± 14.9 days, with a range of 8 days to 80 days. Concurrent other psychiatric diagnoses were 
rare, <1% overall in the ITT population. No treatment group had more than 1 subject with a 
concurrent other psychiatric diagnosis. There were no meaningful differences in the psychiatric 
histories comparing the individual treatment groups. The psychiatric histories of the subjects in the 
Safety and PP populations were similar to those reported for the ITT population. There were no 
meaningful differences between the treatment groups in the incidences of pre-existing medical 
conditions that might be expected to affect the interpretation of the safety or efficacy results. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications were anxiolytics (used by 75% of subjects in the 
lurasidone 40 mg group, 81% of subjects in the lurasidone 120 mg group, 65% of subjects in the 
olanzapine group, and 73% of subjects in the placebo group) and hypnotics and sedatives (used by 
58% of subjects in the lurasidone 40 mg group, 51% of subjects in the lurasidone 120 mg group, 52% 
of subjects in the olanzapine group, and 55% of subjects in the placebo group). A higher proportion of 
subjects in the lurasidone 120 mg group (41% of subjects) used anticholinergic agents compared with 
the lurasidone 40 mg group (20%) and the olanzapine group (18%). A smaller proportion of subjects 
in the placebo group (9%) used anticholinergic agents compared with subjects receiving either 
lurasidone or olanzapine. 
Numbers analysed 
For the double-blind phase, a total of 473 (99%) subjects were analysed for efficacy (Intent-to-Treat 
population) and 475 (99%) subjects were analysed for safety (Safety population) (see table above for 
more detail).

Outcomes and estimation 
Table 17. Change from Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score – 
Repeated Measures (Intent-to-Treat Population). 
There was a statistically significant difference between both lurasidone doses and placebo at Week 6 in 
the PANSS total score when the repeated measures analysis was used (primary endpoint). Olanzapine 
15 mg was also statistically superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (see table 18).

Table 18. Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI-S) Score – Change from Baseline (MMRM 
analysis). 
Statistically significant differences favouring lurasidone 40 mg and 120 mg over placebo were 
demonstrated for the key secondary endpoint of CGI-S.  
A statistically significant effect of lurasidone 40 and 120 mg over placebo was also observed for PANSS 
positive subscale scores (p=0.035; p=0.035); PANSS negative subscale scores (p=0.004; p=0.045); 
and PANSS general psychopathology subscale score (p=0.02; p=0.022). There was no difference 
comparing either lurasidone treatment group with placebo in the MADRS. 
Olanzapine showed statistically significant superiority versus placebo in CGI-S (-0.5; p<0.001), PANSS 
positive subscale (-3.9; p<0.001), PANSS negative subscale (-2.6; p<0.001), PANSS general 
psychopathology subscale (-5.5, p<0.001), and MADRS (-2.3; p=0.003). 
In the lurasidone 40 mg group, a significantly greater proportion of subjects (ITT population) compared 
with placebo showed a ≥30% improvement (p=0.018), ≥40% improvement (p=0.024), and ≥50% 
improvement (p=0.006) in the PANSS total score. The statistical significance held after adjustment for 
multiplicity, using Hommel’s procedure, for all three categories (p=0.037, p=0.049, and p=0.012, 
respectively). 
Ancillary analyses (LOCF Endpoint based on the ANCOVA model)  
In the supportive analysis, there were statistically significant treatment differences of -7.9 (p=0.001) 
and -4.8 (p=0.049) in the change from Baseline to LOCF endpoint in PANSS total score at Week 6 
when comparing the lurasidone 40 mg and 120 mg groups, respectively, with the placebo group.

Statistically significant differences in favour of lurasidone 40 mg and 120 mg over placebo were also 
seen for the secondary endpoints: CGI-S (p=0.012; 40 mg dose only); PANSS positive subscale 
(p=0.007;p=0.038); PANSS negative subscale (p=0.004; 40 mg dose only); and PANSS general 
psychopathology subscale (p=0.002; 40 mg dose only). 
For the olanzapine group the treatment difference compared with the placebo was significant at LOCF 
endpoint for PANSS total score, positive, negative and general psychopathology subscales, CGI-S and 
MADRS.  
A total of 371 subjects (78%) reported one or more TEAE. The proportion of subjects reporting one or 
more TEAE in the lurasidone treatment groups (79%) compared with the placebo group (72%) was 
similar. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (as reported on the 
termination page of the eCRF) was similar comparing subjects receiving lurasidone (9%) with placebo 
(9%). More subjects in the lurasidone 120 mg group (9%) discontinued from the study due to an 
event other than a worsening of the existing condition (as reported on the AE page of the eCRF) 
compared with subjects treated with placebo (4%); however, the proportion of subjects in the 
lurasidone 120 mg group was similar to the proportion in the olanzapine group (7%). 
The proportion of subjects reported to have study medication-related TEAEs (possibly, probably, or 
related) was higher in the lurasidone 120 mg group (72%) and the olanzapine group (67%) compared 
with the lurasidone 40 mg group (59%) and the placebo group (53%).There seem to be dose 
dependant trend in the extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). For more detailed safety assessment please

Short Term Efficacy Study D1050233 - A Phase 3 Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo- And 
Active Comparator controlled Clinical Trial To Study The Efficacy And Safety Of Two Doses Of 
Lurasidone In Acutely Psychotic Subjects With Schizophrenia (Pearl 3) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Adult male and female subjects in good physical health between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, who 
met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a primary 
diagnosis of schizophrenia (including disorganised [295.10], paranoid [295.30], and undifferentiated 
[295.90] subtypes as established by clinical interview using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview [MINI] Plus) were eligible for inclusion in this study. The duration of the subject’s illness, 
whether treated or untreated, must have been greater than one year. Subjects must have been 
experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (no longer than 2 months) associated with 
marked deterioration in function and must have been hospitalised for the purpose of treating an acute 
psychotic exacerbation for two consecutive weeks or less immediately before Screening. Subjects must 
have had a PANSS total score ≥ 80 at Screening and Baseline, with a score ≥ 4 (moderate) on two or 
more on the following PANSS items: delusions, conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations, and unusual 
thought content. Subjects must also have had a score ≥ 4 on the CGI-S at Screening and Baseline. 
Subjects had to agree and be able to remain off prior antipsychotic medication for the duration of the 
study. Subjects could not be pregnant, nursing, or planning pregnancy within the projected duration of 
the study. Subjects of reproductive potential had to agree to remain abstinent or use two acceptable 
methods of birth control during the study. Subjects had to test negative for selected drugs of abuse at 
Screening and Baseline (in the event a subject tested positive for cannabinoids [tetrahydrocannabinol] 
or alcohol, the investigator evaluated the subject’s ability to abstain from prohibited substances during

the study). Subjects must have had a stable living arrangement for at least 3 months prior to 
randomisation. 
Treatments 
During the washout period, subjects were to receive single-blind placebo for 7 days followed by either 
lurasidone 80 mg/day, or lurasidone 160 mg/day, or quetiapine XR 600 mg/day, or placebo. Subjects 
randomised to the lurasidone 80 mg dose group were started at the assigned dose of 80 mg/day and 
remained at that dose for the duration of the study. Subjects randomised to the lurasidone 160 mg 
dose group were to receive lurasidone 120 mg for Days 1 and 2, then the assigned dose of lurasidone 
160 mg/day, thereafter. Subjects randomised to the quetiapine XR 600 mg dose group were to receive 
quetiapine XR 300 mg for Days 1 and 2, then the assigned dose of quetiapine XR 600 mg/day 
thereafter. All medication was to be taken once daily in the evening by mouth with a meal with water, 
or within 30 minutes after eating. 
Objectives 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone (80 mg/day and 160 mg/day) compared with placebo in 
subjects with acute schizophrenia (diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
4th Ed., Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR] criteria). 
Secondary objectives included: evaluation of lurasidone efficacy in improving functional outcome after 
6 weeks of treatment; evaluation of lurasidone efficacy in improving symptoms of schizophrenia during 
first week of treatment; evaluation of lurasidone efficacy in improving depressive symptoms after 6 
weeks of treatment; evaluation of safety and tolerability of lurasidone in acutely schizophrenic subjects 
during the 6-week treatment phase; evaluation of lurasidone effects on specific domains. In addition, 
the efficacy of quetiapine XR (600 mg per day) compared with placebo in subjects with acute 
schizophrenia (diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria) was also evaluated for assay sensitivity purposes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints included the mean change from Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6. 
The secondary outcomes included: 
•  Mean change from Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI-S) at Week 6 
[key secondary]. 
Similarly to previous studies other efficacy endpoints were evaluated: 
•  Mean change from Baseline in PANSS total score at Day 4;  
•  Mean change from Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 
•  Mean change from Baseline in the PANSS positive, negative, excitability and general 
psychopathology subscales; 
•  Mean change from Baseline in the PANSS total score at Week 6 for Quetiapine XR.  
Moreover, responder rates in the PANSS total score (responders = 20% or greater improvement from 
Baseline) were also assessed.  
Other efficacy variables assessed only in this study included:

Change from Baseline in CogState computerised cognitive composite score and each of 7 
cognitive domains at Week 6 and LOCF Endpoint; 
Change from Baseline in Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16) total score at Week 6 and 
LOCF Endpoint; 
Change from Baseline in UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment Brief Version (UPSA-B) 
total score at Week 6 and LOCF Endpoint;  
Change from Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) total score at Week 3, Week 6, and 
LOCF Endpoint; 
Change from Baseline in Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self Administered Version (QWB-SA), at 
Week 6 and LOCF Endpoint; 
Change from Baseline in Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) score at Week 6 and LOCF 
Endpoint. 
In addition a number of safety variables were followed and recorded, namely proportions of subjects 
with AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and SAEs. 
Sample size 
The planned sample sizes of N=120 for lurasidone 80 mg/d and N=120 for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 
N=120 for placebo will provide 82% power (all significant comparisons) or 98% any-contrast power (at 
least one significant comparison) to test the primary hypotheses (tree gatekeeper Family F1), 
assuming lurasidone differs from placebo by 8 (SD=19, effect size 0.42) and 10 (SD=19, effect size 
0.53) points in the PANSS total improvement score at Week 6 for the 80 mg/d and 160 mg/d doses, 
respectively, and to reject the null hypotheses of no difference from placebo in at least 1 lurasidone 
dose. These power calculations are based on results from the Monte Carlo computer simulation, using 
the expected effect size from Phase II lurasidone studies (D1050006 and D1050196). The overall 
family-wise Type I error rate is maintained at 5%. 
The planned sample sizes of N=120 for lurasidone 80 mg/d and N=120 for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 
N=120 for quetiapine XR provide 91% power (at least one significant comparison) to detect an 
expected effect size of 0.4 for improvement in the cognitive composite score at Week 6, rejecting the 
null hypotheses of no treatment difference from quetiapine XR in at least one dose of lurasidone. 
Randomisation 
Following the screening and washout periods, subjects who continue to meet entry criteria were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 4 double-blind treatment arms: lurasidone 80 mg/day, lurasidone 160 
mg/day, placebo, or quetiapine XR 600 mg/day (1:1:1:1 ratio). 
Blinding 
The placebo washout phase was single-blind such that the investigator was not be blinded. The 
treatment period was double-blind. A unique subject number was be assigned by the Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS) when a subject entered the screening phase. Each subject received 1 subject 
number. Following the 3- to 7-day washout period, subjects who continued to meet eligibility criteria 
were randomised to treatment in a double-blind fashion via the IVRS. The unique subject number 
allocated a subject to a particular treatment group and identified the subject for data collection 
purposes.

Statistical methods 
Primary: The primary efficacy parameter was the mean change from Baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 6. It was evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) model with an 
unstructured variance-covariance matrix. The model included factors for pooled centre, time (including 
all scheduled post-Baseline visits, modelled as a categorical variable), Baseline PANSS total score, 
treatment, and treatment-by-time interaction. The Kenward-Rogers method was used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The treatment and treatment-by-time interaction terms allowed for 
comparisons of the treatment groups at each of the scheduled time points. P-values for the comparison 
of lurasidone doses versus placebo at Week 6 were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the 
Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure. The primary analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) population. The analysis was also conducted on the Per Protocol (PP) population. 
In the supportive analyses for the ITT and PP populations, the mean change from Baseline in PANSS 
total scores at scheduled visits and Week 6 last observation carried forward (LOCF) Endpoint were 
evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with effects for Baseline total PANSS 
score, pooled centre, and treatment. 
Key Secondary: In the key secondary endpoint for the ITT and PP populations, the mean change from 
Baseline in CGI-S score at Week 6 was evaluated using the same MMRM model used for the PANSS 
total score. This was included in the Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure to adjust for multiple 
comparisons at Week 6. 
The mean change from Baseline in CGI-S score at scheduled visits and Week 6 LOCF Endpoint were 
also evaluated using ANCOVA, as supportive analyses, with effects for Baseline score, pooled centre, 
and treatment. 
Other Efficacy: The PANSS responder rates were evaluated with logistic regression. The PANSS 
subscores and symptom factor scores were evaluated using MMRM and a supportive ANCOVA. MADRS, 
CogState Computerised Cognitive Battery, UPSA-B, NSA-16, ESS, QWB-SA, MSQ were evaluated using 
ANCOVA.

Safety 
population 
Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 21 October 2008; the last subject completed the acute phase on 02 
June 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol dated 27 May 2008 was amended 3 times. None of the changes in any of the 
amendments negatively impacted subject safety or integrity of the data collected during the course of 
the study. 
Baseline data 
Of the 486 subjects in the Safety population, 332 (68%) were male and 154 (32%) were female. 
Subject age ranged from 18 to 65 years, with a mean age of 37.2 years. The majority of subjects were 
White (57%), followed by Black or African American (20%), and Asian (20%). American Indian or 
Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders had 1 subject (< 1%) in the Safety 
population. No meaningful differences were observed among treatment groups for any of the 
demographic variables. 
The highest proportion of subjects treated was 43% in Europe (18% in Russia, 15% in the Ukraine, 
and 10% in Romania), while 31% of subjects were treated in North America (all in the US), 20% in 
Asia (India), and 5% in South America (Colombia). 
Overall, the majority of subjects in the ITT population were diagnosed with paranoid-type 
schizophrenia (92%), followed by undifferentiated type (7%), and disorganised type (< 1%). 
Approximately half the subjects (50%) had 4 or more hospitalisations for schizophrenia. The average 
age (± SD) at initial onset of schizophrenia was 25.0 ± 8.2 years, with a range from 0 years (data in 
initial onset of schizophrenia only collected information on year. Subject 23318803 had an initial 
schizophrenia onset date in 1991and her birthday was 12 June 1991, therefore the initial onset age 
was recorded as 0) to 53 years of age. The average duration (± SD) of the current episode of 
schizophrenia (from onset to randomisation) was 31.7 ± 13.2 days, with a range of 8 days to 73 days. 
Concurrent other psychiatric diagnoses were rare; the most common other concurrent psychiatric 
diagnoses were major depression and insomnia, each reported in 2 subjects (Table 14.1.3.8). There 
were no meaningful differences in the psychiatric histories comparing the individual treatment groups. 
The psychiatric histories of the subjects in the Safety and PP populations were similar to those reported 
for the ITT population. 
There were no meaningful differences between the treatment groups in the incidences of pre-existing 
medical conditions that might be expected to affect the interpretation of the safety or efficacy results.

A higher proportion of lurasidone-treated subjects were reported to have used anticholinergic agents 
(16% in the lurasidone 80 mg group and 17% in the lurasidone 160 mg group) compared with the 
quetiapine XR group (8%) and the placebo group (< 1%). 
The most commonly used concomitant medications were anxiolytics (used by 54% of subjects in the 
lurasidone 80 mg group, 51% of subjects in the lurasidone 160 mg group, 53% of subjects in the 
quetiapine XR group, and 64% of subjects in the placebo group) and hypnotics and sedatives (used by 
27% of subjects in the lurasidone 80 mg group, 26% of subjects in the lurasidone 160 mg group, 25% 
of subjects in the quetiapine XR group, and 32% of subjects in the placebo group). The higher 
frequency of anxiolytic usage in the placebo group relative to the 3 active medication groups may be 
reflective of a relative lack of efficacy of the placebo. A higher proportion of lurasidone-treated subjects 
were reported to have used anticholinergic agents (16% in the lurasidone 80 mg group and 17% in the 
lurasidone 160 mg group) compared with the quetiapine XR group (8%) and the placebo group (< 
1%). 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 668 subjects consented and were screened to participate, 180 subjects were screen failures, 
488 subjects were randomised, and 353 subjects completed the study. A total of 482 subjects were 
analysed for efficacy (Intent-to-Treat population) and 486 subjects were analysed for safety (Safety 
population).

The CGI-S scores also confirmed the superiority of all three active treatments over the placebo 
(p<0.001).  
All treatment groups differentiated from placebo at Day 4. The results for PANSS subscores were also 
in line with the results for the total score. Similarly, PANSS responder analysis confirmed the 
superiority of all three active treatments against the placebo. 
All three active treatment arms also showed statistically significant superiority over placebo in respect 
to the improvements of MADRS. 
A total of 294 subjects (60.5%) reported one or more TEAE. The proportion of subjects reporting one 
or more TEAE was similar in all groups: lurasidone combined group (60.2%), quetiapine XR group 
(59.7%), and placebo group (62.0%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to a 
TEAE (as reported on the termination page of the eCRF) was also similar across all groups: lurasidone 
combined group (4%), quetiapine XR group (3%), and placebo group (4%). The proportion of subjects 
reported to have study medication-related TEAEs (possibly, probably, or related) was lowest in the 
placebo group (29.8%) followed by the lurasidone 80 mg group (40.8%), the quetiapine XR group 
(47.9%), and the lurasidone 160 mg group (49.6%). A greater proportion of subjects in the lurasidone 
treatment groups were reported with EPS-related TEAEs (12.2%) than in the quetiapine XR group 
(5.9%) or the placebo group (0.8%), although the lurasidone frequencies did not appear to vary with 
dose. A smaller proportion of subjects in the lurasidone treatment groups and the placebo group were 
reported with metabolic TEAEs (1.6% and 2.5%, respectively) than in the quetiapine XR group (7.6%).

Ancillary analyses (LOCF Endpoint based on the ANCOVA model)  
There were statistically significant treatment differences in primary efficacy endpoint (total PANSS 
scores at Week 6) between Baseline and study endpoint when comparing the results from 80 mg and 
160 mg groups to placebo using ANCOVA at LOCF endpoint (p<0.001). The ANCOVA analysis of the 
change in CGI-S score from Baseline to LOCF Endpoint demonstrated a significant treatment difference 
comparing the lurasidone 80 mg group (-0.6, p < 0.001) and the lurasidone 160 mg group (-0.8, p < 
0.001) with placebo. The ancillary analysis confirmed the significant difference between placebo and 
treatment groups in total PANSS scores at Day 4. 
There was a significant treatment difference in both the lurasidone 80 mg group (-2.0, p = 0.002 and -
2.9, p < 0.001, respectively) and the lurasidone 160 mg group (-1.9, p = 0.004 and -3.3, p < 0.001, 
respectively) compared with placebo in the MADRS total score at LOCF endpoint. 
ANCOVA analysis of scores from additional tools used in the study showed improvement in lurasidone 
groups as compared with placebo in NSA-16, QWB-SA, UPSA-B and MSQ scores, while the results from 
CogState Computerised Cognitive Battery and Epworth Sleepiness Scale did not show significant 
differences versus placebo. 
A total of 294 subjects (60.5%) reported one or more TEAE. The proportion of subjects reporting one 
or more TEAE was similar in all groups: lurasidone combined group (60.2%), quetiapine XR group 
(59.7%), and placebo group (62.0%). 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (as reported on the termination 
page of the eCRF) was also similar across all groups: lurasidone combined group (4%), quetiapine XR 
group (3%), and placebo group (4%). The proportion of subjects reported to have study medication-
related TEAEs (possibly, probably, or related) was lowest in the placebo group (29.8%) followed by the 
lurasidone 80 mg group (40.8%), the quetiapine XR group (47.9%), and the lurasidone 160 mg group 
(49.6%). A greater proportion of subjects in the lurasidone treatment groups were reported with EPS-
related TEAEs (12.2%) than in the quetiapine XR group (5.9%) or the placebo group (0.8%), although 
the lurasidone frequencies did not appear to vary with dose. A smaller proportion of subjects in the 
lurasidone treatment groups and the placebo group were reported with metabolic TEAEs (1.6% and 
2.5%, respectively) than in the quetiapine XR group (7.6%). For more detailed safety assessment

Treatments 
Subjects who met entry criteria continued treatment with either flexibly dosed lurasidone or quetiapine 
XR (QXR), based on their treatment assignment in Study D1050233 in a double-blinded fashion. 
Subjects previously treated with either 80 or 160 mg/day of lurasidone or placebo were to be treated 
with lurasidone 120 mg/day for Days 0 to 6. Likewise, subjects previously treated with quetiapine XR 
(600 mg) were to be treated with quetiapine XR 600 mg/day for Days 0 to 6. Beginning on Day 7, the 
dose of study medication could be adjusted (40 to 160 mg/day for lurasidone; 200 to 800 mg/day for 
quetiapine XR) if deemed clinically appropriate by the treating psychiatrist. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term maintenance of antipsychotic efficacy 
of lurasidone (40 to 160 mg/day, flexibly dosed) compared with quetiapine XR (200 to 800 mg/day, 
flexibly dosed) in subjects with schizophrenia who have demonstrated clinical response to a 6-week 
course of treatment with either lurasidone or quetiapine XR in Study D1050233. 
Secondary objectives included: 
•  Evaluation of the efficacy of lurasidone compared with quetiapine XR in the treatment of 
impaired cognition associated with schizophrenia at Endpoint (Month 6); 
•  Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of lurasidone as measured by the proportion of 
subjects with adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, and serious AEs (SAEs); 
•  Evaluation of the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lurasidone compared with 
quetiapine XR. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse of psychotic symptoms defined as the earliest 
occurrence of any of the following: 
•  Worsening of ≥ 30% Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from D1050233 
Day 42 and CGI-S ≥ 3; 
•  Re-hospitalisation for worsening of psychosis; 
•  Emergence of suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and/or risk of harm to self or others. 
Other endpoints included the PANSS total score, CGI-S score, PANSS subscores, MADRS total score, 
NSA-16 total score , Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Quality of Well-Being Scale, Self-
Administered Version (QWB-SA), CogState computerised cognitive composite score and individual 
domain scores, and UPSA-B total score. 
The primary safety endpoints included evaluation of Adverse events (AEs); discontinuations due to 
AEs; and serious AEs (SAEs). 
Sample size 
All subjects completing Study D1050233 were eligible for the present study. No formal sample size 
estimation was carried out.

Blinding  
Subjects who met entry criteria and provided informed consent were assigned a new subject number 
by the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The IVRS assigned a new subject number to be 
used for the duration of the present study. As the primary objective of the present study was to 
evaluate the maintenance of antipsychotic efficacy, subjects continued double-blind treatment with 
either lurasidone or quetiapine XR, based on their treatment assignment in Study D1050233. Subjects 
who had been assigned to placebo in D1050233 were switched to lurasidone. Subjects and study 
personnel were not blinded to dose level. They remained blinded to treatment (lurasidone or 
quetiapine XR) for the duration of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Analysis – Time to Relapse 
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of time to relapse of psychotic symptoms between 
lurasidone (40 to 160 mg/day, flexibly dosed) and quetiapine XR (200 to 800 mg/day, flexibly dosed). 
The population for the relapse analysis (Relapse population) included those subjects who demonstrated 
clinical response (a CGI-S score ≤ 4 and at least a 20% decrease [improvement] in PANSS total score 
from Baseline) to 6 weeks of treatment with either lurasidone or quetiapine XR in the core study and 
then took at least one dose in the extension study (D1050234) of either lurasidone (Lur-Lur) or 
quetiapine XR (QXR-QXR). Differences in time to relapse between the Lur-Lur group and the QXR-QXR 
group were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with country as a covariate. Lurasidone 
was demonstrated as non-inferior to quetiapine XR in preventing relapse if the upper limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio was no greater than a non-inferiority margin of 1.93. 
Other Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy information for subjects who received placebo in Study D1050233 was summarised and 
analysed separately from subjects who were assigned to active treatment. 
Analyses of the PANSS total score, PANSS subscores (Positive, Negative, General Psychopathology, 
Excitability, and Cognition), PANSS Symptom Factor Scores (Positive, Negative, Depression/Anxiety, 
Disorganised Thought, and Hostility), CGI-S scores, MADRS total score, NSA-16 total score, ESS total 
score, MSQ score, QWB-SA total score, CogState computerised cognitive scores, and UPSA-B total 
score were based on a mixed models for repeated measurement (MMRM) model with restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation under the assumption of an unstructured covariance matrix. 
Safety Analyses 
The safety data including AEs, laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs were 
summarised and subjected to clinical review. 
Results 
Participants flow 
A total of 353 subjects (72%) completed the 6-week phase of the D1050233 study. Of the subjects 
who completed the 6-week phase of the study, 83% (292 subjects) continued into the D1050234 
extension phase, with 72 (58%) subjects from the lurasidone 80 mg group, 79 (65%) subjects from 
the lurasidone 160 mg group, 85 (73%) subjects from the quetiapine XR group, and 56 (47%) 
subjects from the placebo group continuing into the extension phase. A total of 140 subjects completed 
the study (107 lurasidone-treated subjects and 33 quetiapine XR-treated subjects).

Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled in study D1050233 on 21 October 2008; the first subject started study 
D1050234 on 08 December 2008, the last subject completed study D1050234 on 01 June 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, 45 subjects (21%) were excluded from the Relapse population due to one or more major 
protocol deviation to form the PP population. The most common protocol deviation was “did not have 
post-extension Baseline efficacy measurement,” with 17 Lurasidone-treated subjects (12%) and 13 
quetiapine XR-treated subjects (16%) not having a post-extension Baseline efficacy measurement. 
Overall, 14 subjects (6%) did not have ≥ 14 days of continuous exposure, 8 lurasidone-treated 
subjects (6%) and 6 quetiapine XR-treated subjects (8%). 
Baseline data 
Of the 292 subjects in the Safety population, 195 subjects (67%) were male and 97 subjects (33%) 
were female. Subject age ranged from 18 to 65 years, with a mean age of 37.6 years. The majority of 
subjects were White (60%), followed by Asian (22%), and Black or African American (15%). No 
meaningful differences were observed among treatment groups for any of the demographic variables. 
The highest proportion of subjects treated was 48% in Europe (20% in the Ukraine, 19% in Russia, 
and 9% in Romania), while 24% of subjects were treated in North America (all in the US), 23% in Asia 
(all in India), and 5% in South America (all in Colombia). 
The majority of subjects in the ITT population were diagnosed with paranoid-type schizophrenia 
(94%), followed by undifferentiated type (5%), and disorganised type (1%). Almost half the subjects 
(47%) had 4 or more hospitalisations for schizophrenia. The average age (± SD) at initial onset of 
schizophrenia was 25.5 ± 8.2 years, with a range from 3 to 53 years of age. The average duration (± 
SD) of the current episode of schizophrenia (from onset to randomisation in the core D1050333 study) 
was 31.7 ± 12.5 days, with a range of 8 days to 71 days. Concurrent other psychiatric diagnoses were 
rare; major depression, acute psychosis, agoraphobia, insomnia, and enuresis were diagnosed in one 
subject each. There were no meaningful differences in the psychiatric histories comparing the 
individual treatment groups. The psychiatric histories of the subjects in the Relapse, Safety, and PP 
populations were similar to those reported for the ITT population. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications were anxiolytics (used by 33% of lurasidone-
treated subjects and 32% of quetiapine XR-treated subjects), anticholinergic agents (used by 20% of 
lurasidone-treated subjects and 6% of quetiapine XR-treated subjects), and hypnotics and sedatives 
(used by 15% of lurasidone-treated subjects and 11% of quetiapine XR-treated subjects). 
Numbers analysed 
The 292 received at least one dose of Study D1050234 study medication and were evaluated for 
safety, 256 were evaluated for efficacy (ITT population), and 218 subjects were analysed for the 
primary analysis of relapse (Relapse population).

The probability of relapse at Month 12 was 23.7% for lurasidone and 33.6% for Quetiapine XR. The 
relapse HR comparing lurasidone vs. Quetiapine XR was 0.728 (95% CI [0.410, 1.295]). The upper

limit of the 95% CI was below the predefined non-inferiority threshold (1.93). The Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of the probability of relapse is presented in Table 22 and Figure 1.  
The PANSS total score continued to decrease from the extension Baseline through Month 12 in the Lur-
Lur group (-5.0, 95% CI: -7.8, -2.1), while it increased in the QXR-QXR group (1.7, 95% CI: -2.4, 
5.9). In the analysis of the change from the core Baseline contrasting the Lur-Lur group with the QXR-
QXR group, there were significant treatment differences from Month 3 (-4.7, p = 0.022) through Month 
12 (-8.9, p = 0.006). 
The CGI-S remained stable through Month 12 after the initial decrease in the Lur-Lur group, from a 
change of -1.9 (95% CI: -2.0, -1.8) at Day 42 to -1.9 (95% CI: -2.1, -1.7) at Month 12. In the QXR-
QXR group, CGI-S increased from -1.8 (95% CI: -2.0, -1.7) at Day 42 to -1.6 (95% CI: -1.9, -1.4) at 
Month 12. In the analysis of the change from the core Baseline contrasting the Lur-Lur group with the 
QXR-QXR group, there were statistically significant treatment differences at Month 6 (-0.4, p = 0.003) 
and Month 9 (-0.6, p < 0.001). At Month 12, the treatment difference was -0.3 (p = 0.069). 
In the Lur-Lur group, scores continued to decrease through to Month 12 for all of the PANSS 
subscores. For the QXR-QXR group, scores continued to decrease through Month 12 in the PANSS 
Negative subscore and the Cognition subscore, but increased overall from the extension Baseline to 
Month 12 for the PANSS Positive subscore, the General Psychopathology subscore, and the Excitability 
subscore. In the analysis of the change from the core Baseline, there were significant treatment 
differences at Month 12 contrasting the Lur-Lur group with the QXR-QXR group for the Positive 
subscore (-2.7, p = 0.002), the General Psychopathology subscore (-4.3, p = 0.012), the Excitability 
subscore (-1.3, p = 0.003), and the Cognition subscore (-1.1, p = 0.037). 
MADRS total score increased slightly after Day 42 of Study D1050233 through Month 12 in both the 
Lur-Lur and the QXR-QXR groups, from a change of -6.2 (95% CI: -6.9, -5.5) at Day 42 to -6.0 (95% 
CI: -7.2, -4.8) and a change of -5.3 (95% CI: -6.3, -4.4) to -3.8 (95% CI: -5.6, -2.1), respectively at 
Month 12. In the analysis of the change from the core Baseline contrasting the Lur-Lur group with the 
QXR-QXR group, there were statistically significant treatment differences at Month 3 (-1.4, p = 0.045) 
and Month 12 (-2.2, p = 0.043), but not at Month 6 (-1.4, p = 0.074). 
For the other secondary endpoints the analyses of the change from the extension Baseline were 
consistent with the changes seen at Day 42 in the analyses of changes from the core Baseline. 
132 lurasidone-treated subjects (All-Lur, 63.8%) and 61 quetiapine XR-treated subjects (71.8%) 
reported one or more TEAE. In subjects who had received lurasidone since the beginning of the core 
Baseline (Lur-Lur, Study D1050233), 97 subjects (64.2%), reported one or more TEAE, which was 
similar to the proportion of quetiapine XR-treated subjects, with a difference in proportion of -7.5% 
(95% CI: -19.4%, 5.4%). In the All-Lur group, 30 subjects (14.5%) were reported with EPS-related 
TEAEs. A greater proportion of subjects in the Lur-Lur group were reported with EPS-related TEAEs (18 
subjects, 11.9%) compared with the QXR-QXR group (3 subjects, 3.5%), with a treatment difference 
of 8.4% (95% CI: 1.0%, 15.4%). When comparing the Lur-Lur group with the QXR-QXR group, the 
proportion of subjects with metabolic TEAEs was similar, with a treatment difference of -3.3% (95% 
CI: -12.4%, 4.0%). 
Ancillary analyses 
The applicant received the scientific advice from the CHMP Scientific Advice Working Party on the 
development programme for lurasidone. The working party expressed concerns about the study design 
including: 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 66/147 
 
 
- the randomisation. The CHMP SA concluded that a trial can only be accepted as an extension if the 
populations correspond to the initially randomised groups;  
- the impact of dose adjustments in the early phase of the D1050234 study and the inclusion of a sub-
therapeutic dose of quetiapine XR (200 mg) within a flexible dosing range;  
- the duration of the initial trial that which may not have allowed for true stabilisation with potential 
carried over effects from the previous short-term (6 week) study D1050233 to the extension and 
maintenance of effect study D1050234 with an increased risk for discontinuation due to relapse during 
the initial phase of that study.  
The Applicant performed post-hoc sensitivity analyses to address the critical issues pertinent to the 
study design.  
The analysis considered to be crucial by the CHMP included all ITT subjects from study D1050233 
except for placebo subjects with a relapse event artificially assigned at Baseline for those who did not 
enter Study D1050234. In this analysis, the HR (CI) of lurasidone versus quetiapine XR increased to 
1.08 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.49) due to the greater number of lurasidone subjects being assigned an early 
“relapse”. It was concluded that non-inferiority remained consistent with the primary analysis.  
Another post-hoc sensitivity analyses was performed after excluding those subjects who ever received 
quetiapine XR 200 mg/day (n=4). It did not support a significant difference in risk for relapse between 
the lurasidone and quetiapine patient groups, most likely due to the low number that were treated with 
the expected sub-therapeutic dose of 200 mg. 
Furthermore, the impact of the length of the stabilisation phase, and analyses considering alternative 
definitions for response in the short-term study, Study D1050233, and relapse in the long-term 
efficacy study, Study D1050234, were explored. It was concluded by the Applicant that the results of 
those post-hoc sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses were additionally performed based on key Baseline characteristics between 
lurasidone and quetiapine XR in the subset of originally randomised subjects included in the Relapse 
and ITT Populations in Study D1050234. It was concluded that the results of these post-hoc sensitivity 
analyses support a comparable baseline for the efficacy evaluations in the subsequent extension 
phase.  
Study D1050237 - Long-Term Safety, Tolerability, and Effectiveness of Lurasidone in 
Subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder: A Randomised, Active Comparator-
Controlled Trial (Double-Blind Phase) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study included subjects between 18 to 75 years with DSM-IV criteria for a primary diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, including disorganised (295.10), paranoid (295.30), undifferentiated (295.90), catatonic 
(295.20), or residual (295.60) or schizoaffective disorder (295.70) subtypes, as established by a 
structured diagnostic interview (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]-Plus) and 
application of DSM-IV subtypes who agreed to participate in the study. The duration of the subject’s 
illness, whether treated or untreated, must have been at least one year. Only schizophrenic subjects 
were permitted to participate in the sub-study. Subject must have been “clinically stable” (non-acute 
phase of illness) for at least 8 weeks prior to Baseline defined as CGI-S ≤ 4 (at both Screening and 
Latuda

Baseline); No change in antipsychotic medications (minor dose adjustments for tolerability purposes 
were permitted) for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening; No hospitalisation for psychiatric illness for at 
least 8 weeks prior to Screening; Moderate or less (≤ 4) severity rating on PANSS Positive Scale Items 
(at both Screening and Baseline) for Delusions (P1); Conceptual Disorganisation (P2); Hallucinations 
(P3); Unusual Thought Content (G9). Subject could not be pregnant (negative serum pregnancy test at 
Screening) or nursing (not be lactating) and was not planning pregnancy within the projected duration 
of the study. Subjects of childbearing age needed to agree to remain abstinent or use adequate and 
reliable contraception throughout the study. Subjects needed to test negative on the urine drug test 
for drugs of abuse at Screening. Subjects would comply with the study procedures and outpatient visit 
requirements in the opinion of the investigator. 
Treatments 
Lurasidone was to be dosed at 80 mg/day for Days 1 to 7, after which the dose could be adjusted to 
between 40 and 120 mg/day. Risperidone was to be dosed at 2 mg/day for Day 1 and Day 2 and then 
increased to 4 mg/day on Day 3. Beginning with Day 8, risperidone dosing could be adjusted to 
between 2 and 6 mg/day. Flexible dosing of study medication earlier than Day 8 required approval by 
the Medical Monitor. 
Lurasidone 40 mg oral tablets with matching placebo and risperidone over-encapsulated oral capsules 
(containing 2, 4, or 6 mg) with matching placebo were utilised in a double-dummy design. All study 
medication was blinded (double-blind) at the beginning of the double-blind phase. Subjects could 
participate in day hospital or outpatient programs throughout all phases of the study. 
All study medication was to be taken once daily by mouth with the morning meal or within 30 minutes 
after eating. Subjects who experienced sedation, with investigator concurrence, could take the study 
medication with their evening meal; this change in dosing schedule was permitted after Week 1 and 
was to be recorded in the eCRF. If a subject elected to take his/her dose in the evening, then the 
subject was to continue to take the study medication in the evening for the remainder of the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the long-term safety study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 
lurasidone in up to 12 months of double-blind treatment, followed by 6 months of open-label 
treatment, in clinically stable outpatients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  
Furthermore treatments effects on metabolic, endocrinologic and ophthalmic function were assessed. 
Other objectives consisted of the evaluation of the long-term efficacy of lurasidone and risperidone 
including the maintenance of clinical stability and relapse prevention. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety was assessed by the proportion of subjects with: Adverse events (AEs); Discontinuations due to 
AEs; Serious AEs (SAEs). 
The main secondary endpoints included: changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), waist 
circumference, serum prolactin, testosterone, N-telopeptide (NTx), osteocalcin, bone alkaline 
phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and ECG parameters; changes in BMD for subjects treated 
with lurasidone and risperidone after 6, 12, and 18 (lurasidone only) months using dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scans (cognition sub-study centres); ophthalmologic assessments for lurasidone 
and risperidone groups after 6, 12, and 18 (lurasidone only) months of treatment (cognition sub-study 
centres);

Relapse was defined as the earliest occurrence of any of the following: 
•  Worsening of > 30% PANSS total score from Baseline (Day 0) and CGI-S > 3; 
•  Re-hospitalisation for worsening of psychosis;  
•  Emergence of suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and/or risk of harm to self or others. 
The other efficacy endpoints assessed were: change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
total and subscale scores; change in Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scores; 
change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. 
Sample size 
A non-inferiority log-rank test with the planned sample size of 600 subjects using a 2:1 allocation ratio 
of lurasidone (N = 400) versus risperidone (N = 200) has approximately 85% power at a 0.025 
significance level to demonstrate non-inferiority of lurasidone relative to risperidone in preventing 
relapse over a 1-year double-blind period, based on the following assumptions: 
A1. A non-inferiority hazard ratio margin of 1.6 (hazard rate 0.058 in the lurasidone group to 0.036 in 
the risperidone group) in log-rank test, corresponding to the non-inferiority margin 0.15 for difference 
in survival estimate of relapse rate between lurasidone (0.50) and risperidone (0.35) after 1 year; 
A2. True (actual) hazard ratio = 1 (equivalence in actual hazard rate between lurasidone and 
risperidone). 
Therefore, the planned sample size of 400 lurasidone and 200 risperidone subjects would provide 85% 
power to demonstrate if lurasidone was as effective as risperidone in preventing relapse using a non-
inferiority hazard ratio margin of 1.6, or a non-inferiority margin of 0.15 for the upper of two-sided 
95% confidence limit of the risk difference (lurasidone minus risperidone) in survival estimate of 
relapse rates after 1 year. The planned sample size could detect an effect size of 0.398 for a difference 
between the two treatments with 90% power in a two-sided test at a 0.05 level of significance. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who met entry criteria were randomised (2:1 ratio) to receive, starting on Study Day 1, either 
lurasidone 80 mg/day or risperidone 2 mg/day. 
Blinding  
Study personnel had access to the IVRS to allocate subjects, to assign study medication to subjects, 
and to manage the distribution of clinical supplies. Each person accessing the IVRS was assigned an 
individual unique personal identification number (PIN). They were to only use their assigned PIN to 
access the system and were not to share their assigned PIN with anyone. 
The IVRS was to be used to unblind subjects and to unmask study medication identity. Study 
medication identification information was to be unmasked ONLY if necessary for the welfare of the 
subject. Every effort was to be made not to unblind the subject unless necessary. Any unblinding that 
occurred at a study centre was to be documented. 
Statistical methods 
A response maintenance analysis for relapse rate was performed using a Cox regression survival model 
including terms for treatment and pooled centre. Time to relapse (days) is defined as: date of relapse 
– date of first study medication + 1. Subjects who did not relapse, including those who withdrew early 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 69/147 
 
 
and did not meet the criteria for relapse, were censored on the last dose of study medication in the 
double-blind phase. Subjects who did not complete the double-blind phase, but entered into the open-
label extension phase due to lack of drug supply, were censored on the last dose of double-blind study 
medication. Subjects who were lost to follow-up immediately following randomisation and had no time-
to-event outcomes were considered having been on treatment 1 day without an event. Non-inferiority 
for lurasidone relative to risperidone was assessed by comparing the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the hazard ratio from a Cox proportional hazards model with the non-
inferiority margin of 1.6. 
The observed PANSS total score, PANSS subscores, CGI-S score, and MADRS score at each planned 
visit were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurement (MMRM, i.e., mixed-effects 
longitudinal data analysis [LDA]) model with adjustment for Baseline and pooled centre effects. The 
mixed-effects model included fixed effects terms for time (as a categorical variable), pooled centre, 
and treatment-by-time interaction. The response (dependent) variables consisted of the observed 
scores in individual visits, including the Baseline visit, using the Baseline adjusted mixed-effects model. 
Without the main effect of treatment in this model, the analysis estimated an overall mean of the 
efficacy variable at Baseline for both treatment groups combined. The change from Baseline value for 
efficacy parameters was also evaluated at each planned visit and Month 12 last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) Endpoint using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with effects for Baseline score, 
pooled centre, and treatment.  
Safety: The change from Baseline value for selected laboratory parameters and bone turnover markers 
was evaluated using a nonparametric rank ANCOVA with adjustment for Baseline at Month 12 LOCF 
Endpoint. The change from Baseline for DXA parameters was evaluated at each planned visit and 
Month12 LOCF Endpoint using an ANCOVA, with effects for Baseline parameter score, pooled centre, 
and treatment. 
Results 
Participants flow 
A total of 1090 subjects provided informed consent and were screened to participate in the current 
study, 461 (42%) of whom were screen failures. Of the 629 subjects who were randomised to receive 
study medication, 427 subjects were randomised to receive lurasidone and 202 subjects were 
randomised to receive risperidone. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 17 March 2008; the last subject completed the double blind phase on 
23 July 2010 and the extension phase on 28 January 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol dated 10 December 2007 was amended 3 times. 
Baseline data 
Of the 621 subjects in the Safety population, 428 (69%) were male and 193 (31%) were female. 
Subject age ranged from 18 to 73 years, with a mean age of 41.7 years. The majority of subjects were 
Black or African American (51%), followed by White (38%), Other (6%), and Asian (3%). Native 
Americans and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders made up less than 2% of the Safety 
population. No meaningful differences were observed between the treatment groups for any of the

demographic variables. The majority of subjects were treated in North America (66%, all in the US), 
while 15% of subjects were treated in Africa (South Africa), 14% in South America (Argentina [6%], 
Brazil [4%], and Chile [4%]), 4% in Asia (Thailand [3%] and Israel [< 1%]), and 2% in Europe 
(Croatia). 
Overall, the majority of subjects in the Safety population were diagnosed with paranoid-type 
schizophrenia (72%), followed by undifferentiated type (9%), disorganised type (6%), residual type 
(6%), and catatonic type (< 1%). Schizoaffective disorder was the diagnosis in 6% of subjects. Almost 
half of the subjects (47%) had 3 or more hospitalisations for schizophrenia. The average age (± SD) at 
initial onset of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was 24.5 ± 9.3 years, with a range from 3 
years to 57 years of age. Concurrent other psychiatric diagnoses were rare. Neither treatment group 
had more than one subject with a concurrent other psychiatric diagnosis. There were no meaningful 
differences in the psychiatric histories comparing the individual treatment groups. The psychiatric 
histories of the subjects in the Safety and PP populations were similar to those reported for the ITT 
population. One difference between the treatment groups in the incidences of pre-existing medical 
conditions that might be expected to affect the interpretation of the safety results was in suicide 
attempts; 6% of subjects in the lurasidone group had a history of suicide attempt compared with 1% 
in the risperidone group. 
The most commonly used concomitant medications were anxiolytics (used by 29% of subjects in the 
lurasidone group compared with 25% of subjects in the risperidone group) and hypnotics and 
sedatives (used by 23% of subjects in the lurasidone group compared with 21% of subjects in the 
risperidone group). A lower proportion of subjects in the lurasidone group (11% of subjects) used 
anticholinergic agents compared with the risperidone group (15%). 
Numbers analysed 
For the double-blind phase, a total of 608 subjects were analysed for efficacy (Intent-to-Treat 
population) and 621 subjects were analysed for safety (Safety population).

The relapse hazard ratio comparing lurasidone versus risperidone was 1.31 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.97, p = 
0.194). Non-inferiority of lurasidone relative to risperidone was not demonstrated since the upper 
bound of the 95% CI was greater than the non-inferiority margin of 1.6. The results using the PP 
population were qualitatively similar. In order to evaluate the influence of potentially important 
Baseline covariate on relapse, Baseline PANSS total score was added to the Cox proportional hazard 
model as a covariate. The relapse hazard ratio comparing lurasidone versus risperidone was 1.30 (95% 
CI: 0.87, 1.96, p = 0.205). This was similar to the main analysis; non-inferiority of lurasidone relative 
to risperidone was not demonstrated. 
According to the MMRM, there were no significant differences in PANSS total scores at any time during 
the 12-month double-blind treatment period between lurasidone and risperidone on the PANSS total 
score and CGI-S score. 
The MADRS scores decreased from Baseline to Month 12 in both the lurasidone group (-0.8, 95% CI: -
1.6, -0.0) and the risperidone group (-2.4, 95% CI: -3.4, -1.4). Contrasting the lurasidone group with 
the risperidone group, there were no significant treatment differences in the decrease at any time point 
except for Month 12 (treatment difference = 1.6, p = 0.007). 
The proportion of subjects reported to have study medication-related TEAEs (possibly, probably, or 
related) was similar in the lurasidone group (70.2%) compared with the risperidone group (74.8%). 
The proportion of subjects reported with an EPS-related TEAE was also similar comparing the 
Latuda

lurasidone group (12.9%) with the risperidone group (15.8%). A smaller proportion of subjects in the 
lurasidone group (11.7%) reported at least one metabolic TEAE compared with the risperidone group 
(20.8%) for a difference in proportion of 9.1% (95% CI: -15.8%, -3.0%). 
Ancillary analyses (LOCF Endpoint based on the ANCOVA model)  
No significant treatment differences comparing the lurasidone group with the risperidone group at any 
time point were observed on PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and cognition 
subscores.  
According to the ANCOVA analysis, the mean CGI-S decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in both 
treatment groups from Baseline to Month 12. The change from Baseline to Month 12 (LS mean ± SE) 
in CGI-S was similar (p = 0.402) comparing the lurasidone group (-0.6 ± 0.1) with the risperidone 
group (-0.5 ± 0.1). There was also no difference at LOCF Endpoint (p = 0.320). 
According to the ANCOVA analysis, there was a significant decrease in MADRS total score (LS mean ± 
SE) from Baseline to Month 12 in both the lurasidone group (-1.6 ± 0.4, p < 0.001) and the 
risperidone group (-2.4 ± 0.5, p < 0.001). Comparing lurasidone with risperidone at Month 12, there 
was no significant treatment difference (0.8 ± 0.6, p = 0.229). 
Study D1050238 - A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomised Withdrawal Study Of 
Lurasidone For The Maintenance Treatment Of Subjects With Schizophrenia 
The study consisted of a Screening/Washout Phase followed by an open-label stabilisation phase (up to 
a maximum of 24 weeks), a double-blind, randomised withdrawal phase (maximum of 28 weeks) and 
a follow-up 12-week open-label extension or Follow-up visit. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Acutely psychotic patients, male and female subjects ≥18 and ≤75 years of age with a primary 
diagnosis of schizophrenia including disorganised, paranoid, or undifferentiated subtypes, were eligible 
to be enrolled. Subject must have has had at least one prior episode of psychotic exacerbation as 
judged by the Investigator in the two years preceding screening. Subjects must have had a PANSS 
Total score ≥ 80 with a score ≥ 4 on 1 or more of any PANSS Positive subscale items at screening and 
open-label baseline (Visit 2), and a CGI-S score of ≥ 4 at screening and open-label baseline (Visit 2). 
Subject could not have been pregnant (must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening) or 
nursing (must not be lactating) and is not planning pregnancy within the projected duration of the 
study. Female subject of reproductive potential needed to agree to remain abstinent or use adequate 
and reliable contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of 
lurasidone has been taken. Subject must have been able and agrees to remain off prior antipsychotic 
medication for the duration of the study. Subjects must have had a stable living arrangement at the 
time of screening and agrees to return to a similar living arrangement after discharge, if hospitalised.  
Subjects must have been in good physical health on the basis of medical history, physical examination, 
and laboratory screening. Subjects who required concomitant medication treatment with the following 
agents may have been included if they have been on stable doses.  
Furthermore, there were criteria set for inclusion in the double-blind phase, such that subjects had to 
have achieved and maintained clinical stability for a total of at least 12 weeks in the open-label phase, 
defined as:  
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 73/147 
 
 
 
- 
A PANSS total score ≤70, a CGI-S score <4, and a PANSS item score of ≤4 (moderate or less) 
on all PANSS Positive subscale items over at least 12 weeks with the allowance of 2 excursions (except 
during the last 4 weeks of the open-label phase) assessed at weekly study visits: an excursion is 
defined as a PANSS total score up to a maximum of 80 and/or a CGI-S score up to a maximum of 4 
and/or a PANSS Positive subscale item score up to a maximum of 5. 
- 
- 
A PANSS item score of ≤4 (moderate or less) on item G8 (uncooperativeness).  
Taking a stable dose of lurasidone for the last 4 weeks of the open-label phase. 
This ensured that the double-blind population consisted of subjects enrolled during an acute episode of 
schizophrenia that responded to lurasidone treatment and remained stable for a minimum of 3 months 
before entering the double-blind phase. 
Treatments 
During the open-label stabilisation phase patients received flexibly-dosed lurasidone 40 mg/day or 80 
mg/day (which was the approved dose range for lurasidone at the study start in September 2011. 
Subjects who responded to lurasidone treatment and remained stable for a minimum of 12 weeks were 
eligible to be randomised to the double-blind phase where they received either the same dose of 
lurasidone as at the end of the open-label stabilisation period or matching placebo during the double-
blind phase. 
Hypnotics and sedatives were more frequently used concomitant to placebo compared to the study 
drug. About 25% of the study population received antidepressants together with placebo or lurasidone, 
respectively with no significant difference between these subpopulations. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of D1050238 was to evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance 
treatment of subjects with schizophrenia.  
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lurasidone for the 
maintenance treatment of subjects with schizophrenia. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy was assessed by the time to the first relapse event defined as one or more of the following 
during the double-blind phase:  
•  An increase from double-blind phase Baseline in both PANSS total score of ≥25% and a CGI S 
worsening of ≥1 point, for 2 consecutive visits, occurring no more than 10 days apart.  
•  At any single visit a PANSS item score of ≥5 (moderately severe) on hostility or 
uncooperativeness, or PANSS item score ≥5 on ≥2 items of unusual thought content, delusions, 
conceptual disorganisation, or hallucinatory behaviour.  
• 
Initiation of any of the following treatment interventions for any reason, including worsening of 
schizophrenia, deliberate self-injury /aggressive behaviour, or suicidal ideation:  
-  The initiation of an antipsychotic agent (other than the study drug lurasidone); 
-  The initiation or need for an increase in dose of an antidepressant or mood stabiliser; 
-  An increase of lorazepam (or equivalent) dosage ≥2 mg/day for a minimum of 3 days relative 
to the previous dose; 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 74/147 
 
 
-  Transfer to an increased level or increased intensity of psychiatric care; 
- 
- 
Initiation of electroconvulsive therapy; 
Insufficient clinical response or exacerbation of underlying disease (reported as an adverse 
event [AE]) as determined by the principal investigator; 
-  Deliberate self-injury or repeated aggressive behaviour; active suicidal or homicidal ideation or 
attempt; 
-  Psychiatric hospitalisation (voluntary or involuntary) due to worsening schizophrenia. 
The secondary endpoints reported included: 
•  Time to all-cause discontinuation; 
•  PANSS Total score and PANSS subscores (positive, negative, general psychopathology and 
excitability). 
Safety was assessed by the proportion of subjects with the following clinical and laboratory adverse 
events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Sample size 
It was assumed that the relapse event rates at the end of the double-blind phase (Week 28) would be 
30% and 50% for subjects treated with lurasidone and placebo, respectively. These assumptions were 
based on previous placebo-controlled randomised withdrawal studies for antipsychotics, for example, 
quetiapine, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. A total of 98 relapse events were required to achieve 90% 
power to detect the 20% difference in subjects who had relapse events at the end of the double-blind 
phase (Week 28) between the treatment groups using a log-rank test with 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 
(EAST Version 5.2). This calculation assumed that 2 group sequential tests (1 interim analysis and the 
final analysis) would be performed using a rho (ρ) family spending function with ρ=2 in order to 
determine the stopping boundaries. Based on data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommendation, 
3 group sequential tests (2 interim analyses and the final analysis) using Haybittle-Peto boundary with 
Z=2.516 for 2 interim analyses were performed instead. With this plan, a total of 98 relapse events 
would still provide 90% power with 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 (EAST Version 5.4). 
It was estimated that 244 subjects would need to be randomized in the double-blind phase to achieve 
98 relapse events. In order to randomize 244 subjects, it was estimated that approximately 610 
subjects (2.5 times the number of randomized subjects) would be enrolled in the open-label phase. 
Randomisation and Blinding  
Following the open-label phase, subjects who meet eligibility criteria were randomly assigned by IXRS 
to receive either lurasidone or matching placebo in a double-blind manner (1:1). Randomisation was 
performed at double-blind baseline (Visit 27) to ensure balance across the two treatment groups. A 
unique subject number was assigned by the IXRS when a subject enters the screening/washout period. 
Each subject was given one subject number comprised of 9 digits which allocated a subject to a 
particular treatment group and identified the subject for data collection purposes. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population, which included all subjects who 
were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study medication in the double-blind phase. The 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 75/147 
 
 
primary efficacy analysis for the time to relapse was performed using an unstratified log-rank test to 
assess the difference in survival curves between the 2 treatment groups.  
A secondary efficacy analysis of time to relapse based on the per-protocol (PP) population was also 
performed. The PP population included all ITT subjects under specified conditions in the protocol. 
Change from double-blind baseline to each post-baseline visit in the following scales; PANSS total 
score and PANSS subscale scores; CGI-S score; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total 
score and Short Form-12 version 2 scores was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also performed.

Baseline data 
A summary of the demographic data for the double-blind phase ITT population from D1050238 by 
region is presented in Table 26. Demographic characteristics were well balanced across the lurasidone 
and placebo treatment groups in each region. The majority of subjects in each group were male (62% 
and 64% for US and non-US, respectively), less than 55 years old (83% and 87%), and mean ages 
were 44 and 40 years for US and non-US, respectively. Black or African American (65%) was the most 
common racial category in US subjects and White (84%) was the most common racial category in non-
US subjects.

The percentages of subjects for each subtype of schizophrenia were similar between the 2 treatment 
groups, as well as across nonrandomised and randomised groups. The majority of subjects 
(approximately 90%) were diagnosed with paranoid-type of schizophrenia, though this proportion was 
higher in US subjects than non-US (97% vs. 66% of randomized subjects, respectively). 
The baseline PANSS and CGI-S scores in the open-label study were 90 in the randomised group and 93 
in the nonrandomised group, and a mean CGI-S score of 5 at Baseline, which is consistent with 
previous studies. Subjects who were randomised achieved a greater mean change from open-label 
Baseline than subjects who were nonrandomised (-36 vs. -16 for PANSS total score). 
Subjects entering the double-blind phase had a mean PANSS total score of 54, which indicates that 
symptoms were stabilised. Baseline PANSS total and CGI-S scores were similar across the 2 treatment 
groups, and were consistent with PANSS scores seen in stable patients on treatment, and with having 
been stabilised during the open-label phase of the study (PANSS scores <70 suggest stabilisation of an

acutely symptomatic state). There was a 3.6 difference in PANSS total score, and 0.29 difference in 
CGI-S score, between the total US and non-US subgroups. 
There was a similar distribution of medication use between the lurasidone and placebo treatment 
groups in the double-blind phase. There was a greater use of hypnotics and sedatives in the placebo 
treatment group, however the study protocol specified clear restrictions on the use of hypnotics and 
sedatives in relation to administration, dose and timing of dosing in relation to study assessments.

Overall, 35% of subjects relapsed at some point during the randomised or double-blind phase of the 
study, with 30% of lurasidone subjects and 41% of placebo subjects experiencing a relapse. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse at Week 28 were 0.422 and 0.512 for lurasidone and placebo, 
respectively, and overall there was a statistically significant increase in the time to relapse for 
lurasidone compared with placebo (p=0.039). A sensitivity analysis performed using the Cox 
proportional hazard model for lurasidone vs. placebo produced a HR estimate of 0.66 (0.45, 098) and 
was statistically significant (p=0.041).

worsening schizophrenia. 
The most common reasons for relapse in the lurasidone treatment group were any single visit having a 
PANSS item score ≥5, and insufficient clinical response, with 11% for both categories. In the placebo 
treatment group the most common reason for relapse was having a PANSS item score ≥5, with 20% of 
subjects, Table 28.  
The most common reason for relapse in the non-US subgroup the most common reason for relapse 
was an increase in both PANSS total score and CGI-S, with 10% and 32% of subjects, respectively. In 
the US subgroup the most common reason for both lurasidone and placebo treatment-groups was 
insufficient clinical response, with 14% and 22% respectively, but most of these also fulfilled other 
relapse criteria. The regional subgroup analysis indicated that the treatment effect in the non-US and 
European populations were statistically significant. However, in the US subgroup there was no 
difference in Kaplan-Meier estimates at Week 28 but the observed relapse rate for lurasidone was 
lower for the lurasidone group than placebo. 
Time to Relapse Subgroups for lurasidone vs placebo treated patients differed between the US, non-US 
and EU populations. While there was a statistical significant difference in maintenance of treatment 
effect from lurasidone treatment exceeding that for placebo, this was only demonstrated for the non-
US and EU populations. To explore potential differences in baseline subject characterisation and 
explain the non-significant results in the US subgroup, a post-hoc analysis was performed based on 
hospitalisation status at screening. This exploratory analysis showed that within the US subgroup, a 
further subgroup of subjects who were hospitalised at Screening, showed a numerical separation in 
favor of lurasidone, with an estimated HR (CI) of 0.590 (0.297, 1.174). However, there were no 
differences in either PANSS total scores or other demographic features at open-label baseline. This 
would thus imply a more favourable treatment effect within the US subgroup of patients who were 
hospitalised at screening compared to the out-patient subgroup.  
It is of note that time to relapse was statistically significantly longer only in males treated with 
lurasidone compared to placebo while such an effect was not demonstrated in females. Numerically 
however, there were less patients relapsing following active treatment than for placebo for both 
genders. With regard to race, there was a statistical separation observed in the Male and Black of 
African American subgroups only which could be due to lower subject numbers resulting in wide CIs.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Time to all-cause discontinuation 
There was numerical separation between lurasidone and placebo over the 28-week period in the total 
population, with the lurasidone treatment group having lower rates of discontinuation. The observed 
numerical difference in all-cause discontinuation (10%) is primarily driven by a higher proportion of 
placebo-treated subjects discontinuing for relapse. With regard to total discontinuation, there was a 
statistical significant difference between the lurasidone and placebo treated patient groups only for the 
non-US subpopulation. The higher discontinuation rate observed due to reasons other than relapse or 
study termination in the US group could be explained by this group having spent longer time in the 
double-blind phase than non-US subjects. The discontinuation rate in the US subpopulation did not 
separate between lurasidone and placebo treated subjects.  
PANSS and CGI-S 
During the course of the double-blind phase of the study, in the lurasidone treatment group LS mean 
PANSS total scores increased by 2 to 4 points in the first 6 weeks but thereafter remained broadly 
stable compared with Baseline. In the placebo group LS mean PANSS total score increased by 
approximately 6 points in the first 4 weeks and thereafter was stable compared with Baseline. Overall, 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 81/147 
 
 
there was less increase in PANSS total score in the lurasidone group compared with the placebo group, 
consistent with the effect of lurasidone in maintenance of efficacy, and this was statistically significant 
(p=0.019). Over the course of the double-blind phase the change in CGI-S compared with Baseline 
was assessed at regular intervals (Weeks 1, 2, 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter). A smaller overall 
increase in CGI-S scores was observed from the double-blind Baseline through to Week 28 in the 
lurasidone group compared with placebo, consistent with the effect of lurasidone in maintenance of 
efficacy, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.002). 
Safety  
In D1050238, there were no new safety risks identified and the overall safety and tolerability profile 
was consistent with previous observations from the lurasidone clinical program. 
The overall safety profile of lurasidone in this study was broadly comparable to placebo during the 
double-blind phase. The overall rate of TEAEs in the double-blind phase was lower than previous 
studies. This was most likely due to the exposure of all subjects to lurasidone in the open-label phase 
of the study. Additionally, metabolic laboratory parameters, prolactin and weight increase were 
comparable to placebo. No abnormal QTc signal was observed with lurasidone treatment. No signal 
was noted for suicidality with lurasidone treatment. 
The overall safety profile is consistent with previous observations from the lurasidone clinical program.

Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was used to assess efficacy. An ANCOVA 
model analysis was applied to the dataset. All randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and had a 
Baseline and at least 1 post-Baseline efficacy measure.  
A total of 328 subjects (66% of the randomized subjects) completed the 
study: 84 (67%) subjects in the lurasidone 40 mg group; 86 (70%) subjects 
in the lurasidone 80 mg group; 85 (69%) subjects in the lurasidone 120 mg 
group; and 73 (57%) subjects in the placebo group.  
The Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure was applied to control the 
family-wise Type 1 error rate. The hypotheses (each lurasidone dose vs 
placebo) associated with the primary and key secondary variables for efficacy 
claim are grouped into hierarchical families. The gatekeeping procedure 
accounts for the logical restrictions in the problem by performing stepwise 
multiplicity adjustment. The hypotheses in the first and subsequent (except 
the last) families are performed using a truncated version of the Hommel 
test. Only comparisons corresponding to doses significant in the preceding 
step are tested. The comparisons in the last family are performed using a 
regular Hommel test.

to Week 6, MMRM,

The truncated version of the Hommel test is defined as a convex combination 
of the regular Hommel test and the Bonferroni test. The resulting truncated 
test satisfies the separability condition. The Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping 
procedure controls the overall Type I error rate in the strong sense at the 5% 
α level.

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was used to assess efficacy. An ANCOVA 
model analysis was applied to the dataset. All randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of double-blind study medication and had a Baseline and at 
least 1 post-Baseline efficacy measure. 
Of the subjects in the ITT population (n=473), 119 subjects received lurasidone 
40 mg, 118 subjects received lurasidone 120 mg, 122 subjects received 
olanzapine 15 mg, and 114 subjects received placebo.  
A total of 51 subjects (34% of the randomized subjects) completed the study: 
16 (32%) subjects in the lurasidone 40 mg group; 20 (41%) subjects in the 
lurasidone 120 mg group, and 15 (30%) subjects in the placebo group.  
The Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure was used to adjust for multiple 
comparisons, taking into account multiple doses and multiple endpoints (PANSS 
Total Score at Week 6 [primary], and CGI-S at Week 6 [key secondary]).  
The Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure was applied to control the 
family-wise Type 1 error rate. The hypotheses (each lurasidone dose vs.

Analysis 
population 
and time point 
description 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was used to assess efficacy. An ANCOVA model 
analysis was applied to the dataset. All randomised subjects who received at least 1 
dose of double-blind study medication, and had either a PANSS or CGI-S baseline 
efficacy measurement as well as at least 1 post-Baseline efficacy measurement for 
PANSS or CGI-S were included in the assessment of efficacy.  
All randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication at the 
target dose (40 mg or 120 mg lurasidone, or placebo) and had at least 1 efficacy 
evaluation during the double-blind treatment period (from Day 3 or after).  
A total of 353 subjects (72% of the randomised subjects) completed the study: 89 
(71%) subjects in the lurasidone 80 mg group; 93 (77%) subjects in the lurasidone 
160 mg group; 97 (81%) subjects in the quetiapine XR 600 mg group; and 
74 (61%) subjects in the placebo group. 
The Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure was applied to control the family-
wise Type 1 error rate. The hypotheses (each lurasidone dose vs. placebo) 
associated with the primary and key secondary variables for efficacy claim are 
grouped into hierarchical families. The gatekeeping procedure accounts for the 
logical restrictions in the problem by performing stepwise multiplicity adjustment. 
The hypotheses in the first and subsequent (except the last) families are performed 
using a truncated version of the Hommel test. Only comparisons corresponding to 
doses significant in the preceding step are tested. The comparisons in the last 
family are performed using a regular Hommel test. The truncated version of the 
Hommel test is defined as a convex combination of the regular Hommel test and the 
Bonferroni test. The resulting truncated test satisfies the separability condition. The 
Hommel-based tree-gatekeeping procedure controls the overall Type I error rate in 
the strong sense at the 5% α level.

of any of the following; worsening of ≥30% in PANSS total 
score from Baseline (Day 0) and CGI-S ≥3; re-
hospitalisation for worsening of psychosis; and/or 
emergence of suicidal/homicidal ideation, and/or risk of 
harm to self or others. Relapse percentages were based 
on the number of subjects in the ITT population.

Results and Analysis  
Estimates, p-value, HR for the 2 treatment groups (Lurasidone vs. Risperidone) and HR 95% CI were 
based on a Cox proportional hazards regression model with fixed effects for pooled site and 
treatment.  
Analyses of the PANSS total score, CGI-S and MADRS total score were based on a mixed model for 
repeated measurement (MMRM), based on the mean change from Baseline (Day 0). The model 
included factors for treatment, pooled centre, time (as a categorical variable), Baseline score, and 
treatment-by-time interaction. Treatment comparisons reflected differences in change from Baseline 
estimates between the Lurasidone and Risperidone groups.

Hypotheses  Lurasidone is effective for the maintenance treatment of subjects with schizophrenia  
Treatment 
groups 
Hospitalised or outpatients 
with an acute episode 
schizophrenia.  
Subjects aged 18-75 years with an acute episode of 
schizophrenia (diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed, Text Revisions 
[DSM-IV-TR] criteria and confirmed by SCID-CT).  
Open-label stabilisation 
phase ; Lurasidone flexible 
oral daily dosage. 
Double-blind phase (up to 
28 weeks); Lurasidone or 
placebo oral daily dosage. 
Lurasidone Double-Blind 
Phase, All Randomised 
Subjects 
Placebo 
Lurasidone 40 mg/d or 80 mg/d. Responders and 
stabilised patients for a minimum of 12 weeks were 
eligible to be randomised to the double-blind phase. 
Random assignment to placebo or to continued 
treatment with lurasidone until completion or 
discontinuation from the double-blind phase. Flexible 
oral lurasidone dosage (40 mg to 80 mg) taken once-
daily in the evening, with a meal (at least 350 calories) 
or within 30 minutes after eating. Lurasidone 40 mg/day 
on Days 1 through 3. On Day 4, a scheduled visit and 
thereafter, increase of dose is necessary to optimise 
efficacy at weekly intervals (starting from Visit 4) based 
on Investigator judgment. A dose reduction for 
tolerability purposes is permitted to occur more 
frequently than at weekly intervals. Subjects will 
continue to be flexibly dosed, as necessary, up until the 
last 4 weeks of their 12 week stabilisation period where 
the dose must remain fixed. 
All psychotropic medications, except those specified in 
the protocol, were prohibited during both the open-label 
phase and the double-blind phase. Dose tapering of 
protocol prohibited medications were done during the 
screening phase.

was 
performed 
on the ITT 
population, 
which 
included all 
subjects 
who were 
randomised 
and 
received at 
least 1 
dose of 
study 
medication 
in the 
double-
blind 
phase.  
1.  An increase from double-blind phase baseline in 
both PANSS Total score of ≥ 25% and a CGI-S 
worsening of ≥ 1 point, for two consecutive 
visits, occurring no more than 10 days apart.  
2.  At any single visit a PANSS item score of ≥ 5 
(moderately severe) on hostility or 
uncooperativeness, or a PANSS item score ≥ 5 
on ≥ 2 items of unusual thought content, 
delusions, conceptual disorganisation, or 
hallucinatory behaviour.  
3.  Initiation of any of the following treatment 
interventions, for any reason, including 
worsening schizophrenia, deliberate self-injury / 
aggressive behaviour or suicidal ideation: 
a. the initiation of an antipsychotic agent (other 
than the study drug lurasidone) 
b. the initiation or need for an increase in dose 
of an   antidepressant or mood stabiliser 
c. an increase of lorazepam (or equivalent) 
2 mg/day for a minimum of 3 days 
dosage ≥  
relative to the   previous dose 
d. transfer to an increased level or increased 
intensity  
of psychiatric care  
e. initiation of electroconvulsive therapy.  
4.  Insufficient clinical response (or exacerbation of 
underlying disease) reported as an adverse 
event as determined by the Principal 
Investigator.  
5.  Deliberate self-injury or repeated aggressive 
behaviour; active suicidal or homicidal ideation 
or attempt.  
6.  Psychiatric hospitalisation (voluntary or 
involuntary) due to worsening schizophrenia.  
The primary efficacy analysis for the time to relapse was performed using an 
unstratified log-rank test to assess the difference in survival curves between the 2 
treatment groups. The time to event was censored in the following cases: 1) when a 
subject discontinued from or completed the double-blind phase of the study without 
experiencing any relapse event, 2) for the interim analyses: when a subject was on-
going during the double-blind phase without experiencing any relapse event at the time 
of database freeze for the interim analysis, or 3) for the final analysis: when an on-
going subject terminated the double-blind phase without experiencing any relapse 
event, due to the Sponsor’s decision to stop the study.

Intent to Attend assessment 
A secondary analysis of time to relapse based on the per-protocol (PP) population was 
performed. The PP population included all ITT subjects satisfying the following 
conditions; received assigned study medication as randomised; had 75% to 125% 
compliance after the calculated compliance was rounded to the whole number (both 
limit values inclusive in the double-blind phase); hand no major protocol deviations.

The results were supportive of the primary efficacy endpoints in Studies D1050229, D1050231 and 
D1050233 and the secondary efficacy endpoints in Studies D1050006 and D1050196. 
Responder analyses 
Moreover, the responder analyses were presented for the pivotal short-term clinical studies. Hereafter 
reported are the results of at least a 30% reduction on the PANSS total score compared with Baseline 
as being generally considered to be a clinically relevant and appropriate definition of responders in 
short term efficacy trials of patients with schizophrenia (CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment of schizophrenia).

The clinically relevant responder rate (≥30%) was observed for the 160 mg lurasidone dose. In 
addition, statistically significant results were seen for the 40 mg and 80 mg doses and while no 
significant effect was shown for the 120 mg dose in either of the 2 studies. Olanzapine and quetiapine 
at equipotent dosages showed a significant effect on the 30% responder rate. 
When discontinuing patients were counted as nonresponders compared with the responder analysis 
without imputation, the proportion of responders in each treatment group (including placebo) 
demonstrating ≥30% improvement in PANSS total score decreased (table 36).

Subject discontinuation  
Given the high discontinuation rate in the 5 pivotal short-term studies, information on subject 
disposition, including the number and percentage of subjects that discontinued overall and due to lack 
of efficacy was presented in the initial application. From the response by the applicant to D120 LoQ, 
this information have expanded to include reasons for discontinuation (Table 37), and time to 
discontinuation in pooled data from the 5 pivotal, short-term studies; D1050006, D1050196, 
D1050229, D1050231, and D1050233 (ITT Population), Figure 5.  
Table 37. Subject Discontinuation (Randomised Population): D1050006, D1050196, D1050229, 
D1050231, and D1050233. 
The discontinuation rate was larger for the placebo than for the lurasidone treated patient group. This 
provides support for a lurasidone treatment effect. Lack of efficacy and withdrawal of consent were the 
two most common reasons for discontinuation among patients treated with placebo or lurasidone. 
Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was a relatively more common than withdrawal of consent 
among patients treated with lurasidone 40 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg or placebo while the opposite for 
those treated with 80 mg daily dosage, although based on small numbers.  
Additionally, discontinuation over time was displayed for pooled data from the 5 short-term clinical 
trials; D1050006, D1050196, D1050229, D1050231, and D1050233 (ITT Population). The probability 
of not discontinuing prematurely for the patient groups treated with placebo or lurasidone 40 mg, 80 
mg, 120 mg or 160 mg, respectively, was plotted versus time, Figure 5.

The least risk for discontinuation was shown among those treated with the 160 mg/d dose, followed by 
the 80 mg/d dose. There was no trend for a disproportional distribution of discontinuation over time for 
any of the 4 lurasidone daily doses, nor for placebo. 
Long-term efficacy studies 
During the procedure the CHMP requested a post hoc analysis of the secondary endpoints (PANSS total

In response the analyses of the change from D1050233 core Baseline to endpoint in D1050234 based 
on MMRM have been presented (table 38).

The results were found to be supportive of a non-inferiority claim for lurasidone. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No efficacy studies in special populations have been carried out yet. The PIP together with a deferral 
have been approved. 
Supportive studies 
Study D1050006 and Study D1050196 
Both studies were double-blind, randomised, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 6-week, 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability studies of SM-13496 (lurasidone) in patients with schizophrenia. 
Efficacy results from Study D1050006 suggested that lurasidone at doses of 40 mg and 120 mg daily 
demonstrated a statistically significant effect in the primary efficacy variable i.e. the mean change from 
Baseline to 6 weeks in BPRSd score for the ITT population. Significant results were also seen in a 
responder analysis defined as ≥20% decreases in BPRSd scores, as compared to placebo. Nonetheless, 
the study population was small (ITT subjects, N=149) and there was a high discontinuation rate (64%) 
leading to only 51 subjects completing the study (of which 36 subjects received lurasidone).  
The results from the second short-term efficacy study (Study D1050196) reported a statistically 
significant mean change in the primary endpoint, BPRSd score, between Baseline and the Day 42 
(0.012) using an ANCOVA model for lurasidone 80 mg compared to placebo. Also for the key

secondary endpoints (CGI-S, PANSS, and MADRS), there was a statistically significant difference 
favouring lurasidone 80 mg over placebo. Out of 180 ITT subjects, 90 subjects received lurasidone, 
however the discontinuation rate in this study was considerable, 99 subjects (55% of the randomised 
subjects) completed the study: 52 (58%) subjects in the lurasidone 80 mg group and 47 (52%) 
subjects in the placebo group. The time-course of discontinuation revealed that more than 50 % of 
patients in both treatment arms had discontinued from the study at study midpoint.  
Initially the above described studies were submitted as pivotal short-term efficacy studies, however 
they were considered by the CHMP as supportive due to the observed high discontinuation rate. 
Furthermore, twelve completed non placebo-controlled studies were conducted: 7 in the US and 5 in 
Japan. Of the 7 studies conducted in the US, one was an active-controlled study (D1050254) and 6 
were uncontrolled, open-label studies (D1050174, D1050199, D1050229E, D1050289, and 
D1050231E, and D1050290). The 5 studies conducted in Japan were all uncontrolled, and included 
three 8-week studies (Studies D1001001, D1001016 and D1001017), one 52-week label extension 
study of D1001001 (D1001036) and one long-term study (Study D1001048).  
Of the listed studies study D1050254 was active-controlled, randomised, multicenter, double-blind, 
fixed dose, parallel group study to estimate the tolerability profile of Lurasidone and an active 
comparator (ziprasidone) in clinically stable outpatients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder. On the first day after completion of the placebo run-in period, subjects were randomised in a 
1:1 ratio to Lurasidone or ziprasidone in a double-blind fashion. The study duration was 3 weeks. 307 
subjects were randomised, and 210 subjects completed the study. A total of 301 subjects were 
analysed for safety and efficacy. The analysis of the efficacy results (PANSS, CGI-S, CDSS, MATRICS, 
SCoRS and NAB) did not reveal any meaningful differences between the treatments. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the short term studies a positive effect of treatment was estimated, however in the view of the 
CHMP, discontinuation rates were considerable and methods selected for addressing the problem of 
missing data (LOCF, MMRM) appeared likely to favour active treatment. Hence, further analyses in line 
with the CHMP guideline on missing data were required to provide estimated treatment effects that 
would unlikely to be biased in favour of active treatment. Accordingly, in addition to the initially 2 
performed analysis - ANCOVA based on last observation carried forward (LOCF) and Mixed-effect 
model repeated measure (MMRM), the more conservative analyses including ANCOVA based on 
observed cases (OC), baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and Pattern-mixture modelling 
(PMM) with placebo-based multiple imputation have been applied to the data set. Disadvantages with 
each of these methods have been thoroughly and sufficiently discussed and ad hoc analyses using 
these methods have been presented for primary and key secondary endpoints and compared against 
the planned analyses submitted in the initial application. Though the point estimate was quite different 
from one method of analysis to the next, statistical significance was consistent in general with the 
initial analysis, therefore supporting the conclusion of a statistically significant treatment effect.  
The reasons for, and timings of patients’ withdrawal have been presented and discussed in detail 
following the committee’s request. The most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of 
consent and lack of efficacy. A listing containing patient-level information on the reason and timing for 
discontinuation in the 5 controlled short-term efficacy studies as well as listing of reasons for 
withdrawal of consent have not revealed any patterns or trends with regard to disposition or day of 
event from start of treatment. The results from the 2 active controlled short-term studies with 
olanzapine 15 mg and quetiapine XR 600 mg showed that overall discontinuation rates were slightly 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 109/147 
 
 
higher in the placebo groups compared with the active comparators. The total percentage of subjects 
who discontinued from lurasidone treatment has been shown to be lower than for placebo in all dose 
groups in all 5 short-term studies with the exception of the 120 mg group in D1050231, which had a 
relatively high percentage of subject discontinuations due to withdrawal of consent. In general, the 
percentage of subjects who discontinued due to lack of efficacy or insufficient clinical response was 
lower in the lurasidone treatment groups than in placebo. However, the withdrawal of consent was 
reported at a slightly higher rate in lurasidone groups compared with placebo in D1050006, D1050196, 
and D1050231. The reasons provided for withdrawal of consent were similar between treatment 
groups. The pooled time to discontinuation data from the 5 placebo-controlled studies (ITT Population) 
was proportionately distributed within the studies (time-interval 0-42 days). In general the rate of 
discontinuation was comparable with the rate observed with other antipsychotic treatments, albeit 
somewhat higher for lurasidone than for the 2 active control treatments (olanzapine 15 mg, quetiapine 
XR 600 mg).   
Responder analyses were included as tertiary endpoints in the phase 3 clinical studies and discussed in 
the initial application. Responder rates corresponding to ≥30% reduction on the PANSS total score 
compared to baseline have been presented including new analyses with patients that discontinued 
counted as non-responders as requested, providing reduced responder rate in most cases. The clinical 
relevance of the differences is discussed below. 
In the short-term studies treatment effects of lurasidone were higher in the European patient 
population compared with the North American population, therefore the CHMP requested the applicant 
to comment on the representativeness of the study results to the EU-population given the small 
number of EU subjects in the short-term pooled database. The applicant provided a summary of results 
for geographic region by treatment interaction based on PANSS total score and CGI S change, using 
the MMRM and ANCOVA models. The results were not statistically significant, indicating that there was 
no treatment difference between the North America, Europe, and RoW regions. Furthermore, the 
applicant also discussed the potential influence of extrinsic factors such as standard/established 
medical practice (i.e., in- or outpatient care), treatment compliance, prevailing practice in the use of 
concomitant medications, and average length of time in relapse before the treatment between 
European and non-European trial populations. The applicant concluded that despite the possible 
differences in access to non-pharmacological interventions between European and non-European 
regions, the pivotal clinical trials implemented standard design and study methods to overcome any 
potential and differential confounding effects on study results thus the results provided an accurate 
representation of the treatment effects of lurasidone in the European population. The CHMP agreed 
with the provided argumentation. 
Patients who received co-medication with an antipsychotic during the pivotal short-term studies were 
excluded from the per protocol population but included in the ITT and safety population. Therefore, the 
CHMP requested the applicant to specify which antipsychotic medication were used in each of the 
pivotal short- and long term efficacy studies in the active treatment arms and whether it could 
interfere with the results of each study. Concomitant antipsychotic usage during the short-term studies 
was numerically higher among risperidone-treated subjects (14% overall), compared with 9% among 
lurasidone-treated subjects and 8% among subjects receiving placebo. In the long-term study, 
D1050234, a double-blind extension of D1050233, only 1 subject in the lurasidone group (<1%) 
received a concomitant antipsychotic (haloperidol). No subject in the quetiapine XR treatment group 
received a concomitant antipsychotic medication. In D1050237, the proportion of patients using 
concomitant antipsychotics was similar in the lurasidone treatment group compared with the 
proportion in the risperidone treatment group. Subjects that received concomitant antipsychotic 
medications were excluded from the PP population but included in the ITT population with similar 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 110/147 
 
 
efficacy results observed with the 2 populations. It was concluded that the co-administration of other 
antipsychotics did not affect the study results. 
The proportion of patients who discontinued for any reason was similar across treatment groups in 
both pivotal long-term studies with the exception for the quetiapine XR patient group in study 
D1050234 which showed twice as high discontinuation rate due to insufficient clinical response. The 
applicant was requested to discuss how the high discontinuation rate in the quetiapine XR group in 
study D1050234 could have influenced the results. The applicant provided the proportion of patients 
who discontinued the study for any reason from the lurasidone and quetiapine XR treatment arms, 
which was 48% and 61% respectively. Withdrawal of consent was the most common reason for early 
discontinuation, with 20% of lurasidone-treated patients and 22% of quetiapine XR-treated patients 
withdrawing consent during the study. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to insufficient 
clinical response was 9% in the lurasidone-lurasidone group and 21% in the quetiapine XR group. 
However, the discontinuation pattern was not associated with the initial dosage. The discontinuation 
rates due to insufficient clinical response observed with quetiapine XR was similar to rates reported in 
other quetiapine XR studies. Therefore, the applicant considered that the discontinuation rate in the 
quetiapine XR group did not affect the final results of the study because the observed relapse rate of 
27% for the quetiapine XR-quetiapine XR arm was similar to previous studies where the quetiapine 
relapse rates were 30% at 12 months (Stauffer et al. 2009), 31% over 2 years (Gaebel et al. 2010), 
and 14% at 6 months (Peuskens et al. 2007). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy and safety of fixed doses of lurasidone 40, 80, 120, and 160 mg/day in the treatment of 
adult subjects with schizophrenia have been assessed in 5 short-term studies. In light of the 
heterogeneous responses to different doses in those studies the applicant was requested to discuss the 
clinical relevance of the findings taking into consideration additional analyses of missing data.  
The applicant argued that the occasional failures of various doses in the short term studies were due to 
the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and the high and unpredictable placebo response rate. The results 
observed with lurasidone were comparable with those of the active comparators used in the 
development programme and with other antipsychotics in general. The CHMP agreed with the general 
assertion that presentations of schizophrenia vary substantially, and that this and the unpredictable 
and high placebo response may have played a role in some studies in the development programme. 
Comparison of the magnitude of the effect to that of the other antipsychotics however was considered 
to be more difficult and uncertain, in particular given that the development programme where active 
comparator was used was not designed to demonstrate superiority of one active treatment over the 
other. The CHMP noted that across the clinical development program, lurasidone has consistently 
shown superior efficacy compared with placebo. Furthermore, the magnitude of symptom reductions 
(change from Baseline in the primary efficacy endpoint) observed with lurasidone across the 
recommended therapeutic dose range of 40 to 160 mg/day and with the active comparators 
(olanzapine 15 mg/day and quetiapine XR 600 mg/day) were similar and the active comparators 
performed as seen in literature that was referred to in the response, thus ensuring assay sensitivity. 
The CHMP concluded that the clinical relevance of the lurasidone 40 mg-160 mg dose range was 
supported by responder rates (≥30% improvement from Baseline in PANSS total score) based on more 
conservative analysis methods. Overall, it was concluded that the short term efficacy had been 
sufficiently justified and it would not differ by an important margin from that of the other 
antipsychotics. The additional analyses of the impact of missing data on study results were found by 
the committee to be reassuring. 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 111/147 
 
 
As mentioned above, the CHMP noted the heterogeneous dose-response with the product. As a result 
the applicant was requested to justify the choice of the dose range and in particular the choice of the 
upper limit (160mg/day) and the dose of 80 mg/day given the statistically significant differences 
between the two doses. Furthermore, the justifications for doses 40mg/day and 120mg/day in view of 
their failure to differentiate from placebo in the study D1050229 and the dose-dependence of some of 
the AEs were also requested. Based on the applicant’s responses, the CHMP concluded that it was 
plausible that heterogeneity of clinical presentations of schizophrenia and high placebo response rate 
might have influenced the dose response. The committee, however, saw as a concern that the highest 
dose (160 mg/day) appeared superior in terms of efficacy to the other doses as this could lead to the 
off-label use of doses higher than 160 mg/day in clinical practice. The applicant was requested to 
ensure that the risk of off-label use of doses higher than 160mg per day was addressed in the RMP. 
The applicant proposed to include high doses and off-label use assessment in the planned PASS/DUS. 
Moreover, the CHMP requested further justification for recommendation of 40 mg per day as the 
starting dose. The applicant supported the choice of the 40 mg starting dose with the data from 
development programme, receptor occupancy studies, clinical guidelines and post-authorisation data. 
The CHMP accepted the justification and requested that this information be reflected in the product 
information. The committee was also of the opinion that there wasn’t sufficient safety-driven evidence 
for restarting treatment with doses higher than 120 mg/day in case of discontinuation in treatment 
lasting longer than 3 days. The appropriate dosing recommendations following treatment 
discontinuation have been included in the SmPC. 
The CHMP also noted that the proposed posology stipulated dose increases based on physician 
judgement and observed clinical responses in the absence of persuasive evidence that a dose increase 
will enhance the response. Therefore, further justification of posology was requested. The applicant 
acknowledged that there was no clear evidence from the clinical studies supporting the up-titration to 
the effective dose. The applicant stated that the proposed posology is in line with the usual clinical 
practice in psychiatry and therapeutic guidelines, and reflected in the product information the finding 
that in the short-term studies there was no consistent dose-response observed. This was accepted by 
the CHMP. 
Long-term efficacy of lurasidone and non-inferiority in time to relapse was evaluated in 2 long-term 
studies D1050234 (extension of study D1050233) and D1050237, and compared to two active 
comparators, quetiapine XR and risperidone at fix followed by variable dosages over 12 months. As the 
extension study D1050234 was partly a non-randomised comparison, and in study D1050237 
lurasidone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to risperidone the CHMP felt that the long-term efficacy 
of lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia required further confirmation. 
To address the concern that study D1050234 could only be accepted as an extension if it represented a 
non-inferiority comparison of truly random groups, a post hoc analysis was performed by the applicant. 
It included all subjects from the D1050233 ITT population, with the exception of subjects randomised 
to placebo. The upper bound of the 95% CI in this post hoc analysis was lower than the predefined 
non-inferiority margin and thus in the applicant’s view supported non-inferiority of lurasidone 
compared with quetiapine XR and the validity of the results from the primary analysis. In addition, to 
include all patients originally randomised into D1050233, a post hoc analysis was also conducted on 
the secondary endpoints in D1050234. There was no relevant difference in the PANSS total score, CGI-
S score or MADRS total score between the lurasidone group and the quetiapine XR group between the 
protocol-specified analysis and the post-hoc analysis. The CHMP agreed with the applicant’s conclusion, 
that the results from the post-hoc analysis indicated non-inferiority between lurasidone and quetiapine 
XR in the prevention of relapse. However, the committee had concerns regarding the long term 
efficacy due to the methodological shortcomings of the extension study D1050234 and the fact that 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 112/147 
 
 
the second long-term study (D1050237) did not demonstrate the non-inferiority in time-to-relapse for 
lurasidone versus risperidone.  
Consequently, the applicant was requested to submit the results from the on-going long term 
randomised withdrawal efficacy study (D1050238) to sufficiently demonstrate long-term efficacy and 
maintenance of effect of lurasidone. The applicant provided a summary of the study results. In the 
view of the CHMP the study conformed well to the design suggested in the current EMA guideline on 
investigation of medicinal products for treatment of schizophrenia. The randomised withdrawal phase 
demonstrated a borderline statistically significant benefit of lurasidone when compared to placebo, 
however the CHMP noted the low number of events and loss of statistical significance if the patients 
censored due to informative censoring (i.e. patients who withdrew whilst the study was still running) 
were counted as events (p=0.070). Therefore the applicant was requested to comment on the narrow 
advantage of lurasidone over placebo in this study, the impact of informative censoring, and apparent 
convergence of the relapse rates between the treatment arms towards the end of the randomised 
period. The applicant re-discussed the initially submitted data and concluded that the totality of 
evidence from a variety of analyses applied indicated that study D1050238 demonstrated the 
maintenance of efficacy over placebo. The CHMP acknowledged the response and agreed that it was 
acceptable that lurasidone does seem to slow relapse when compared to placebo, given that the 
efficacy analysis together with the sensitivity analysis (which assumed all discontinuations not 
originally categorised as relapse events to be relapse) showed separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves, 
and results were close to the statistical significance. It was concluded that the non-significant p-value 
of 0.073 was most likely due to the study being underpowered for this sensitivity analysis. It was also 
accepted that the narrowing of relapse rates towards the end in the ITT analysis may have been due to 
the observed between-group differences in number of subjects at risk. The section 5.1 of the product 
information has been updated to reflect results of both analyses. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Short-term efficacy 
There were 5 short-term (6 week) and 3 long-term (52 weeks) clinical studies to demonstrate short- 
and long-term efficacy of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. In the short-term studies; 
D1050006, D1050196, D1050229, D1050231 and D1050233, the efficacy and safety of lurasidone was 
evaluated at a dose range of 40 mg to 160 mg oral daily doses for 6 weeks compared to placebo. In 2 
of these studies, active comparators were used for comparison of efficacy and benefit/risk evaluations.  
Given the high discontinuation rates observed in the short-term studies, more conservative analysis 
based on ANCOVA/BOCF, ANCOVA/OC and PPM analysis methods were performed. Hence, in addition 
to the initially performed ANCOVA/LOCF and ACOVA/MMRM analysis, it is concluded that the more 
conservative analysis results corroborate the initial results.  
Taking the results from the 5 short-term studies together, a treatment effect has been demonstrated 
from each of the 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg lurasidone doses. However, this effect was not 
consistently demonstrated for each dose in all trials where it was included.  
Overall, short-term efficacy of lurasidone has been sufficiently demonstrated at the proposed 40 mg/d-
160 mg/d clinical dose range for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in adults with schizophrenia. 
However, no consistent dose-response relationship was observed. 
Long-term efficacy studies 
Maintenance of efficacy and non-inferiority to an active comparator was investigated for a time-period 
of 12 months in 2 pivotal long-term lurasidone clinical trials, Study D1050234 and D1050237. Non-

inferiority in time to relapse was supported by the results from a post-hoc sensitivity analysis for 
lurasidone in relation to quetiapine XR, including all ITT subjects from the previous short-term study 
D1050233, with the exception of those treated with placebo, and assigning a relapse event at the 
study D1050234 baseline for those who did not enter the extension study D1050234. The applicant 
was asked to justify that the upper bound of the observed confidence interval (1.490) does not imply 
an increased clinically relevant risk for treatment failure from the lurasidone treatment. This issue was 
addressed in the applicant’s responses and was considered resolved. An additional finalised long-term 
study D1050237 provided support for maintenance of efficacy based on secondary efficacy endpoints, 
however it did not demonstrate statistically significant non-inferiority versus risperidone. For 
confirmation of long-term efficacy of lurasidone, the results from a randomised withdrawal-designed 
long-term study (D1050238) were submitted. In the primary analysis there was a statistically 
significant increase in the time to relapse for patients on lurasidone compared with patients on 
placebo, and overall the committee considered that the results supported the long-term efficacy in the 
claimed indication. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data from the 22 phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies (controlled and uncontrolled studies -
study grouping P23ALL) have been pooled for safety analyses. The P23ALL pool consists of short-term 
controlled (P23STC, P23STO), long-term controlled (P23LTC) and uncontrolled (P23AU) studies. 
Additionally, 31 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects (P1NON) and in subjects with 
schizophrenia (P1SCH) provided supportive safety data. 
Patient exposure 
Clinical trials exposure 
Lurasidone has been evaluated in 52 clinical studies (30 phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies [9 in 
schizophrenia]) and 22 phase 2/3 clinical studies) involving 5068 subjects with schizophrenia (3502 
treated with lurasidone, 724 treated with placebo, 842 treated with other medications). The studies 
were 3 weeks to 22 months in duration and evaluated doses of lurasidone from 20 mg to 160 mg/day.  
Among the lurasidone dose groups in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies (P23STC), 71 subjects 
received 20 mg, 487 received 40 mg, 538 received 80 mg, 291 received 120 mg, and 121 subjects 
received 160 mg. In the long-term, active-controlled studies (P23LTC), 624 subjects received flexible 
doses of lurasidone (40 mg to 160 mg) once daily, 199 received flexible doses of risperidone (2 mg to 
6 mg) once daily and 85 subjects received flexible doses of quetiapine XR (200 mg to 800 mg) once 
daily. The most frequent daily doses for lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR were 80 mg, 4 mg, 
and 600 mg, respectively, in P23LTC. In the uncontrolled studies (P23AU), 1071 subjects were 
exposed to lurasidone.

The total exposure to lurasidone in the phase 2/3 clinical database was 1212 person years. 
The duration of exposure and the number of patients exposed to different doses of lurasidone in the 
P23ALL study grouping is shown in Table 40.

In the CHMP opinion the safety data submitted for all lurasidone subjects fulfilled the requirements of 
the guideline on population exposure (ICH E1). See also discussion on safety. 
Adverse events  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
P23STC population 
Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs (newly occurring or an exacerbation of pre-
existing conditions) with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study medication through 
7 days after study medication discontinuation. 
Of the 1508 lurasidone-treated subjects in P23STC, 1150 (76.3%) reported 1 or more TEAEs. Subjects 
reporting 1 or more TEAEs were 503 (71.0%) of the 708 placebo-treated subjects, 63 (87.5%) of the 
72 haloperidol-treated subjects, 101 (82.8%) of 122 olanzapine-treated subjects, 72 (60.5%) of 119 
quetiapine XR-treated subjects, and 53 (81.5%) of 65 risperidone-treated. Among subjects receiving 
lurasidone, the proportion of subjects with 1 or more TEAE was 74.6% (n=53 of 71) of subjects in the 
20 mg group, 79.9% (n=389 of 487) of subjects in the 40 mg group, 72.7% (n=391 of 538) in the 80 
mg group, 82.8% (n=241 of 291) in the 120 mg group, and 62.8% (n=76 of 121) in the 160 mg 
group. 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 116/147 
 
 
 
The most common TEAEs (with a frequency of ≥5%) for lurasidone were headache, akathisia, nausea, 
insomnia, somnolence, sedation, vomiting, schizophrenia, dyspepsia, agitation, anxiety, and 
constipation.  
Headache was the most common TEAE in subjects receiving lurasidone and occurred with a frequency 
similar to placebo (14.5% for the all lurasidone-treated subjects, 15.0% for the placebo group, 19.4% 
for the haloperidol group, 14.8% for the olanzapine 15 mg group, 10.9% for the quetiapine XR 600 mg 
group, and 4.6% for the risperidone 4 mg group). The incidence of headache was not dose-related. 
The incidence of akathisia, the second most common TEAE in subjects receiving lurasidone, increased 
with increasing lurasidone dose and was very common (over 20 %) in the 120 mg dose group (5.6 % 
of subjects in the 20 mg group, 10.7% of subjects in the 40 mg group, 12.3% of subjects in the 80 mg 
group, 22.0% of subjects in the 120 mg group, and 7.4% of subjects in the 160 mg group). Akathisia 
occurred in lurasidone-treated subjects with a frequency greater than placebo, olanzapine and 
quetiapine XR, but lower than for haloperidol and risperidone (12.9% for all lurasidone-treated 
subjects, 3.0% for the placebo group, 19.4% for the haloperidol group, 7.4% for the olanzapine group, 
1.7% for the quetiapine XR group, and 13.8% for the risperidone group).  
The incidences for all lurasidone-treated subjects reporting nausea (10.1%), the 3rd most common 
TEAE, and sedation (8.5%), were higher than placebo-treated subjects (5.2% and 3.8%, respectively), 
but did not in general increase with increasing dose of lurasidone. 
Somnolence showed a dose-related increase for lurasidone with an incidence of 4.2 % in the 20 mg 
group, 7.6 % in the 40 mg group, 7.4 % in the 80 mg group and 14.4 % in the 120 mg group. Again, 
the incidence for the 160 mg group was lower (6.6 %). Somnolence occurred with a frequency greater 
than placebo but lower than for the active comparators with the exception of risperidone (8.6% for the 
all lurasidone-treated subjects, 3.4% for the placebo group, 12.5% for the haloperidol 10 mg group, 
9.0% for the olanzapine 15 mg group, 13.4% for the quetiapine XR 600 mg group, and 0% for the 
risperidone 4 mg group).  
At the preferred term (PT) level, akathisia, somnolence, and sedation were the 3 most frequent 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAEs with a frequency of ≥1%) for lurasidone-treated subjects.

subjects (short term placebo - controlled pool P23STC). 
Only one study (D1050049) in safety pool P23STC evaluated a lurasidone dose of 20 mg. In that 
study, the safety profile was similar to the 40 mg dose in the same study. The highest lurasidone dose 
of 160 mg used in the placebo-controlled studies was also evaluated in only one study (Study 
D1050233). Adverse events occurred with a low frequency in the 160 mg dose group in this study.

Phase 2/3 long term, active comparator controlled studies (P23LTC) - Studies D1050234 and 
D1050237 
Of the 624 subjects dosed with lurasidone, a similar percentage (77.9%) reported 1 or more TEAEs 
compared with quetiapine XR-treated subjects (70.6%) and risperidone-treated subjects (85.9%). 
The most common TEAEs (with a frequency of ≥5%) in safety pool P23LTC were akathisia, nausea, 
insomnia, and somnolence.  
Akathisia was reported with a higher incidence in subjects receiving lurasidone (13.6%) compared with 
2.4% for quetiapine XR, and 8.0% for risperidone.  
Nausea was the second most common TEAE and was reported with a higher incidence in subjects 
receiving lurasidone (13.3%) compared with 2.4% for quetiapine XR and 11.1% for risperidone.  
Insomnia was reported in 12.8% lurasidone treated subjects, 9.4% quetiapine XR treated subjects, 
and 13.6% risperidone treated subjects. 
Somnolence and sedation were reported with a higher frequency in lurasidone-treated subjects (10.1% 
and 9.9%, respectively), compared with the quetiapine XR group (4.7% and 1.2%, respectively) but at 
a lower frequency compared with the risperidone group (18.1% and 14.1%, respectively). 
An overview of TEAEs reported in ≥ 2% of subjects in the safety pool P23LTC is provided in Table 43.

The number of subjects reporting at least one TEAE was lower (approximately 68 %) in Study 
D1050234 than in Study D1050237 (approximately 85 %). Differences between the two studies were 
noted with a higher incidence of anxiety, insomnia and psychotic disorder in the lurasidone group in 
D1050237 than in D1050234. The incidence of nausea and vomiting for lurasidone was lower in 
D1050234 than in D1050237. 
The safety profile was similar when all phase 2/3 controlled and uncontrolled studies were combined 
compared with the P23STC and P23TC Study Groups. 
TEAEs of special interest 
Further analyses for P23STC, P23LTC, and P23ALL were conducted on specific TEAEs, which were 
grouped into clusters for EPS events (and combined events), Metabolic events, and Hypersensitivity 
events, which were defined based on observations made during the clinical program or known effects 
of the drug class. 
Additionally, a separate cluster was undertaken for analysis of grouped terms for somnolence, 
dystonia, and parkinsonism. 
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) 
In P23ALL, 820 (25.6%) of the “all lurasidone” treated subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-
emergent EPS. The most common treatment-emergent EPS that occurred in this group of subjects 
were akathisia (13.6%), parkinsonism (4.4%), tremor (3.9%), dystonia (3.2%), and restlessness 
(2.5%). The rate of reporting of each of the EPS was similar between P23STC, P23LTC and P23ALL 
pools. The percentage of subjects with EPS-related TEAEs was 9.2% for the placebo group, 24.4% for 
the lurasidone-treated group, 54.2% in the haloperidol group, 23.0% in the olanzapine group, 7.6% in 
the quetiapine XR group, and 27.7% in the risperidone group. 
Tardive dyskinesia and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 121/147 
 
 
 
In the P23STC, P23LTC and P23ALL tardive dyskinesia occurred in 1 (<0.1%), 4 (0.6%) and 11 (0.3%) 
lurasidone-treated subjects. In all phase 2/3 short and long-term studies (P23ALL), neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome occurred in 2 (< 0.1%) lurasidone-treated subjects.  
Metabolic Parameters 
In P23ALL, 6.5% (n=208) of all-lurasidone subjects had at least 1 metabolic TEAE of which 2 (<0.1%) 
led to study discontinuation. In P23STC, 3.2% (n=49) of lurasidone-treated subjects had at least 1 
metabolic TEAE of which 1 (<0.1%) led to study discontinuation. In P23STC, compared to lurasidone, 
metabolic TEAEs occurred in 0 in haloperidol, 30 (24.6%) with olanzapine, 13(10.9%) quetiapine XR 
and 1(1.5%) risperidone. 
In P23LTC, 8.8% (n=55) of flexible-lurasidone treated subjects had at least 1 metabolic TEAE of which 
0 led to study discontinuation. In D1050234 metabolic TEAEs occurred in 13 (6.3%) of lurasidone 
treated subjects and 9 (10.6%) of quetiapine XR treated subjects. In D1050237, metabolic TEAEs 
occurred in 49 (11.7%) of lurasidone treated subjects and 42 (20.8%) of risperidone treated subjects 
Weight Gain 
In all phase 2/3 short and long-term studies (P23ALL), weight increased was reported in 134 (4.2%) 
all-lurasidone subjects. In pooled short-term (6-week) clinical trials (P23STC), TEAE of weight 
increased was reported in 12 (1.7%) placebo, 33 (2.2%) in all lurasidone, compared to 0 in 
haloperidol, 25 (20.5%) in olanzapine, 12 (10.1%) in quetiapine XR, and 1 (1.5%) in risperidone, 
treated subjects. In P23STC the mean change in weight was a 0.43 kg increase for lurasidone treated 
patients compared to a 0.02 kg decrease for placebo-treated patients. In P23STC a ≥ 7% weight 
increase occurred in 23 (3.3%) placebo, 71 (4.8%) in all lurasidone treated subjects, 3 (4.2) in 
haloperidol, 42 (34.4%) olanzapine, 17 (15.3%) in quetiapine XR and 4 (6.2%) in risperidone treated 
subjects.  
In all phase 2/3 long-term studies (P23LTC), weight increased was reported in 46 (7.4%) flexible-
lurasidone subjects. In D1050234, TEAE of weight increased in 4.8% of Lurasidone treated subjects 
versus 8.2% of quetiapine XR in D1050234. In D1050237 weight increase was reported in 39 (9.3%0 
of lurasidone and 40 (19.8%) of risperidone, treated subjects. 
Following 12 months treatment in D1050237 a ≥ 7% weight increase was observed in 30 (7%) 
lurasidone, compared to 27 (14%) risperidone, treated subjects. In D1050234, ≥ 7% weight increase 
was observed in 21 (11.5%) lurasidone versus 6 (8.2%) quetiapine XR treated subjects after 12 
months treatment. 
Dyslipidaemia 
In the phase 2/3 short-term studies pool (P23STC), TEAEs coded to preferred MedDRA terms blood 
triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperlipidaemia occurred in 5 (0.3%), 0, and 0 
lurasidone-treated subjects, respectively. 
In the phase 2/3 long-term studies pool (P23LTC), TEAEs coded to preferred MedDRA terms blood 
triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperlipidaemia occurred in 3 (0.5%), 0, and 1 
(0.2%), in flexible-lurasidone subjects, respectively. 
In all phase 2/3 short and long-term studies (P23ALL), TEAEs coded to preferred MedDRA terms blood 
triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperlipidaemia occurred in 32 (1.0%), 3 (<0.1%), 
and 7 (0.2%) of all-lurasidone subjects, respectively. 
In pooled short-term (6-week) clinical trials, the mean (SD) change in total fasting cholesterol from 
Baseline to LOCF for lurasidone-treated subjects was -0.15 (0.75) mmol/L compared to -0.16 (0.77) 
mmol/L for placebo treated subjects. For fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the mean (SD) change 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 122/147 
 
 
from Baseline to LOCF levels was -0.09 (0.60) mmol/L for lurasidone-treated subjects compared to 
0.09 (0.64) mmol/L for placebo treated subjects. For high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the mean (SD) 
changes from Baseline to LOCF was -0.02 (0.24) mmol/L for lurasidone-treated subjects compared to -
-0.07 (0.21) mmol/L in placebo group. Mean change from Baseline to LOCF for triglyceride levels 
(fasting) was -0.15 (0.80) mmol/L for lurasidone-treated subjects and -0.17 (0.83) mmol/L for 
subjects in the placebo group. 
Diabetes/hyperglycaemia 
In P23ALL, the incidence of TEAEs that coded to MedDRA PTs suggestive of hyperglycaemia and 
diabetes mellitus (blood glucose increased (n=24, 0.7%), glycosylated haemoglobin increased (n=5, 
0.2%), hyperglycaemia (n=8, 0.2%), impaired glucose tolerance (n=1, <0.1%), glycosuria (n=1, 
<0.1%), diabetes mellitus (n=4, 0.1%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=2, <0.1%)) ranged from 0 to 
0.7%. 
Somnolence 
In P23STC somnolence (defined as the combined PTs of hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and 
somnolence) was reported in 17.0% of All Lurasidone, and in 7.1% of Placebo-administered subjects. 
In P23LTC PT somnolence was attributed to 19.9% of Lurasidone, 31.7% of risperidone, 5.9% of 
Quetiapine XR-treated subjects.  
Other TEAEs of special interest included: venous thromboembolism, seizures, cerebrovascular 
disorders/stroke, orthostatic hypotension, withdrawal syndrome, angioedema, 
leukopenia/agranulocytosis, bone fracture. 
Venous Thromboembolism 
There were no TEAEs of venous thromboembolism reported in the phase 2/3 clinical studies. 
Seizures 
In the all phase 2/3 short and long-term controlled and uncontrolled studies (P23ALL) pool, complex 
partial seizures occurred in 1 (<0.1%) lurasidone-treated subject and convulsion occurred in 5 (0.2%) 
lurasidone-treated subjects. There were no reports in either the placebo or active comparator 
treatment groups.  
Cerebrovascular Disorders/Stroke 
In P23ALL there were 3 reports of cerebrovascular accidents out of the total number of patients who 
received lurasidone.  
Orthostatic Hypotension 
In all phase 2/3 short and long-term studies (P23ALL), 11 (0.3%) lurasidone-treated subjects 
experienced orthostatic hypotension and 1 (<0.1%) experienced postural orthostatic tachycardia 
syndrome. In P23STC there were 2 (1.6%) subjects in the olanzapine treatment group, and 3 (2.5%) 
subjects in the quetiapine XR treatment group who experienced orthostatic hypotension.  
Withdrawal syndrome 
Based on the cumulative data in P23ALL, no safety signal has been identified following abrupt 
discontinuation of lurasidone treatment, nor has a withdrawal syndrome associated with lurasidone 
treatment cessation been observed. There have been no TEAEs of “drug withdrawal syndrome” (PT) 
reported to date in the phase 2/3 clinical database (IDB). There was 1 TEAE of “withdrawal syndrome” 
(PT). 
Angioedema 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 123/147 
 
 
There were no cases of angioedema reported in the P23STC pool. One case was reported in the P23LTC 
pool and 0 cases in the other studies resulting in 1 case reported in the P23ALL pool. 
Thus, in all Phase 2/3 short and long-term studies (P23ALL), the TEAE of angioedema occurred in 1 
(<0.1%) “all-lurasidone” subjects.  
Bone Fracture 
In the P23STC subjects, there was 1 (<0.1%) fracture reported in the lurasidone-treated subjects and 
in the P23LTC pool there were 8 (1.3%) subjects who received flexible dose lurasidone who reported 
fractures. 
The incidence of TEAEs that coded to MedDRA PTs related to bone fractures was low (24 cases [0.7%]) 
in all-lurasidone subjects in the phase 2/3 studies (P23ALL). 
QT prolongation  
In safety pool P23STC the frequency of QTc prolongation (male > 450 msec, female > 470 msec) 
using Bazetts’s correction (QTcB) for the lurasidone-treated and placebo groups was 3.9 % for 
lurasidone and 3.5 % in the placebo group, respectively. With Fridericia’s correction, the incidence of 
QTc prolongation was 1.0 % and 3.0 %, respectively. For comparison, the frequency of QTcB 
prolongation in safety pool P23STC was 4.5 % in the haloperidol 10 mg group, 5.8 % in the olanzapine 
15 mg treatment group, 4.7 % in the quetiapine XR 600 mg group, and 6.2 % in the risperidone 4 mg 
treatment group, and for QTcF prolongation 1.5 % in the haloperidol 10 mg group, 0 % in the 
olanzapine 15 mg group and the quetiapine XR 600 mg group, and 4.6 % in the risperidone 4 mg 
treatment group. 
In the long-term phase 2/3 comparator controlled studies (P23LTC), the frequency of QTcB 
prolongation (male QTc >450 msec, female QTc >470 msec) for the flexible dose lurasidone, flexible 
risperidone and flexible quetiapine XR groups was 6.2%, 13.9%, and 4.6%, respectively. The incidence 
of prolongation for QTcF for the flexible dose lurasidone, flexible risperidone, and flexible quetiapine XR 
groups was 1.0%, 2.6%, and 0%, respectively. 
ECG measurements taken at various time points during the lurasidone clinical programme did not show 
any QT prolongations exceeding 500 ms. There were no occurrences of Torsade de pointes, ventricular 
tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or flutter reported in any subjects treated with lurasidone in all 
short and long-term phase 2/3 studies (P23ALL). 
In all short and long-term phase 2/3 studies (P23ALL), among lurasidone-treated subjects, 8 (0.2%) 
experienced syncope, 2 (< 0.1%) experienced loss of consciousness, 1 (< 0.1%) experienced complex 
partial seizures, and 5 (0.2%) experienced convulsion. There were no clinically meaningful increases in 
QTc noted for any of these subjects. 
In the P23ALL group, 6 (0.2%) lurasidone-treated subjects experienced ventricular extrasystoles of 
whom 1 (<0.1%) lurasidone-treated subject in the P23STC group, experienced ventricular 
extrasystoles reported to be related to the study medication. There was no clinically meaningful 
increase in QTc duration in this subject. 
Thorough QT study 
A “Thorough QT” (TQT) study (Study D1050249) was conducted to characterise the potential effect of 
lurasidone on the QT interval. This study was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, three-arm, 
parallel study in male and female schizophrenic or schizoaffective subjects.  A total of 87 subjects (67 
male and 20 female) were enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of study drug. Of these, 
73 subjects received all doses of study drug and completed all study procedures.  
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 124/147 
 
 
Subjects were administered either lurasidone 120 mg/day (standard dose, n=23) or 600 mg/day 
(supratherapeutic dose), n=20) over 11 days. A positive control arm was included where subjects were 
administered ziprasidone 160 mg/day (n=23) over the 11-day treatment period. No placebo arm was 
included.  
Twelve-lead ECGs were obtained Day 0 (baseline) and Day 11 at protocol-specified time points (Day 0: 
at 1,2,4,6 and 8 hours after time zero. Day 11: at 1,2,4,6 and 8 hours after the AM dose of lurasidone 
or ziprasidone). To improve the chance to capture any peak effect on QTc, ECG replicates and 
corresponding means were also extracted at 4 additional time points pre-dose and at the 3-, 5- and 7-
hour post dose time points on Day 11, and at matching time points on Day 0. Lurasidone serum 
concentrations were determined at the following time points: Day 2 to Day 11: trough concentrations; 
Day 11: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose.  
Pharmacodynamic variables included: ECG intervals (heart rate [HR], PR, RR, QRS, QT). QT interval 
corrected for heart rate using different approaches: Fridericia’s: QTcF=QT/RR0.33, Bazett’s: 
QTcB=QT/RR0.5, Individual: QTcI=QT/RRγi, Population based: QTcP=QT/RRψ and Model-based 
correction. 
Table 44.  
In the lurasidone 120-mg study arm, dQTcI increased between 1-hour to 2-hour post dose and 
declined between 2-hour to 8-hour post dose. The upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI was greater 
than 10 ms at 2-hour and 4-hour post dose (14.7 and 13.3 ms, respectively).  
In the lurasidone 600 mg study arm, the dQTcI versus time profile remained relatively constant with 
small fluctuations during 8 hours post dose. The upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI was greater 
than 10 ms at 1-hour, 2-hour, 4-hour and 8-hour post dose (10.2, 10.9, 11.5 and 11.4 ms, 
respectively).  
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 125/147 
 
 
 
In the lurasidone 120-mg study arm, the maximum upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI dQTcI of 
14.7 ms occurred at 2-hour post dose at which time the mean change from baseline was 9.4 ms.In the 
lurasidone 600-mg study arm, the maximum upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI of 11.5 ms 
occurred at 4-hour post dose at which time the mean change from baseline was 5.8 ms. 
In the positive control ziprasidone 160-mg study arm, the maximum upper bound of the two-sided 
90% CI dQTcI of 22.6 ms occurred at 4-hour post dose at which time the mean change from baseline 
was 17.7 ms.  
There were no patients in the lurasidone arms in the study that experienced absolute QTcI > 450 ms 
or change from baseline dQTcI > 30 ms. For other correction factors (QTcB, QTcF and QTcP) in both 
lurasidone study arms, there were no absolute QTc values above 480 ms or change from baseline QTc 
more than 60 ms. According to the ICH E14 guideline, the thorough QT study (TQT) is to be considered 
inconclusive (drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by more than 5 and less than 20 ms; see 
clinical safety discussion on section 2.6). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall, 19 deaths were reported during the lurasidone clinical development program. The data cut-off 
for the reporting was 30 June 2012. Of the 19 deaths, 17 were included in the integrated clinical 
database (IDB). Two events happened pre-treatment and were not included in the IDB. The following 
categories of deaths were identified: 
- Thirteen lurasidone treatment-emergent deaths; 
- Two pre-treatment deaths not included in the IDB; 
- Two non-treatment emergent lurasidone deaths;  
- Two deaths on comparator drugs. 
Of the 13 deaths in lurasidone-treated subjects, there were 3 sudden deaths, 1 death due to 
hypertensive heart disease and 1 due to myocardial infarction. Five subjects exposed to lurasidone 
committed suicide. The remaining deaths were due to septic shock (1), thermal burn (1) and road 
traffic accident (1).  
For the 3 subjects classified as ‘sudden deaths’ no autopsies were available. The death of one subject 
was confounded by administration of intramuscular haloperidol close to the event. One subject, a 73-
year old woman with a possible diagnosis of heart infarction or pulmonary embolus as cause of death, 
had experienced a heart infarction in the past. Where the results of ECG investigations were available, 
there were no significant changes reported. With regard to concomitant medications, there was no 
initiation of CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment for any of the subjects. Considering the available data for these 
3 subjects, a causal association with lurasidone is considered unlikely. 
There were 5 reports of completed suicide in subjects exposed to lurasidone in the P23ALL lurasidone 
study grouping (n=3202, 0.16 %). These subjects had been on lurasidone for variable times before 
death (22 days, 24 days, 223 days, 182 days, and 78 days, respectively). The doses of lurasidone 
were 120 mg, 60 mg, 60 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg, respectively. There was no pattern evident regarding 
duration of treatment, dose of lurasidone, concomitant medications (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors) or 
demographic characteristics, except that all subjects were Asian. The 5 subjects were between 30-
years old and 64-years old. 
There was no particular signal from P23STC for suicide or suicidal ideation but the number of suicide 
attempts and episodes of self-harm appeared to be very low in comparison to the number of 
completed suicides.

A total of 69 lurasidone treated subjects reported serious adverse events (SAEs) in the double-blind, 
short-term controlled studies (P23STC). The proportion of subjects with SAEs in this group were the 
following: 40 of 708 (5.6%) in the placebo group, 69 of 1508 (4.6%) for all-lurasidone group, 5 of 72 
(6.9%) in the haloperidol 10 mg, 6 of 122 (4.9%) in the olanzapine 15 mg, 3 of 119 (2.5%) in the 
quetiapine XR 600 mg, and 2 of 65 (3.1%) in the risperidone 4 mg group. 
The 69 lurasidone-treated subjects with SAEs were distributed to the following lurasidone dosing 
groups: 4 of 71 (5.6%) lurasidone 20 mg, 25 of 487 (5.1%) lurasidone 40 mg, 17 of 538 (3.2%) 
lurasidone 80 mg, 18 of 291 (6.2%) lurasidone 120 mg, and 5 of 121 (4.1%) lurasidone 160 mg. 
In lurasidone-treated subjects from the P23STC group, the most common SAEs were in the psychiatric 
disorders SOC and included schizophrenia (40 [2.7%] subjects), psychotic disorder (10 [0.7%] 
subjects), and suicidal ideation (4 [0.3%] subjects). All other SAEs in lurasidone-treated subjects 
occurred with an incidence of <0.1% (1 subject).  
In the pooled long-term, double-blind, active comparator controlled studies (P23LTC), the proportion of 
subjects with SAEs were distributed as follows:  66 of 624 (10.6%) subjects in the lurasidone group, 
17 of 85 (20.0%) subjects for quetiapine XR, and 20 of 199 (10.1%) subjects for risperidone treated 
subjects. Sixteen of 624 (2.6%) lurasidone-treated subjects, 6 of 199 (3.0%) risperidone treated 
subjects, and 8 of 85 (9.4%) quetiapine XR subjects experienced SAEs considered related to the study 
treatment. 
The most frequent SAEs in the long-term studies (P23LTC) were in the psychiatric disorders and 
nervous system disorders SOCs. The most common SAEs in lurasidone-treated subjects in SOC 
psychiatric disorders included psychotic disorder (19 [3.0%] subjects), schizophrenia (13 [2.1%] 
subjects), suicidal ideation (2 [0.3%] subjects), schizophrenia, paranoid type (2 [0.3%] subjects), 
agitation (2 [0.3%] subjects), and anxiety (2 [0.3%] subjects). For nervous system disorders, SAEs 
were reported in 8 (1.3%) lurasidone-treated subjects, 2 (1.0%) risperidone-treated subjects, and 0 
quetiapine XR-treated subjects. Parkinsonism was observed in 2 (0.3%) lurasidone-treated subjects 
but not in the other treatment groups. 
One SAE of angioedema was reported in the P23ALL pool. This SAE was associated with partial airway 
obstruction and caused discontinuation from the study.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology evaluations 
For haematology evaluations, there were no changes that are considered to be clinically meaningful. In 
P23ALL, leukopenia occurred in 1 (<01 %) and neutropenia in 3 (<0.1 %) of lurasidone-treated 
subjects. No cases of agranulocytosis were reported. 
Liver function tests  
In short-term, placebo-controlled studies (pool P23STC) the proportion of subjects with normal to high 
shifts in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase was 3.1%, 4.8%, and 1.0%, respectively for the 
lurasidone-treated subjects and 4.9%, 4.1%, and 0.7%, respectively for subjects in the placebo group. 
None of the lurasidone-treated subjects in pool P23STC had a markedly abnormal value (MAV) for liver 
function tests that met the criteria for Hy’s Law.  
In the long-term, active comparator-controlled studies (pool P23LTC) in the lurasidone flex group, the 
proportion of subjects with markedly abnormal laboratory values (MAVs) for AST and ALT (≥3 X upper 
limit of normal [ULN]) was 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. No subject in any treatment group had an 
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value that met the criteria for MAV.

Page 127/147 
 
 
In all clinical studies, for the parameters of ALT, AST, Alk phosphatase and LDH, the proportion of 
lurasidone-treated subjects with ≥ 3xULN post-baseline values was 1.1%, 0.8 %, <0.1 % and <0.1 %, 
respectively. A total of 0.6 % of subjects had markedly abnormal bilirubin levels (≥35 μmol/L). 
Renal function tests 
In the phase 3 short-term placebo-controlled studies (pool P23STC) no short-term or long-term 
adverse changes from baseline over time were observed with lurasidone for bicarbonate, blood urea 
nitrogen, calcium, chloride, potassium, or sodium.  
Slight mean (SD) increases from baseline were observed for creatinine in lurasidone-treated subjects 
over time: 3.08 (11.76) μmol/L (Week 2), 3.94 (11.48) μmol/L (Week 4), 5.26 (11.84) μmol/L (Week 
6), and 4.60 (11.77) μmol/L (LOCF endpoint). In addition, an effect of lurasidone dose on creatinine 
increase was also observed at each time point. At LOCF endpoint, mean (SD) changes in creatinine 
from Baseline in the lurasidone 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg dose groups were: 2.86 
(11.93) μmol/L, 3.20 (11.42) μmol/L, 4.28 (11.12) μmol/L, 6.23 (12.10) μmol/L, and 8.89 (13.61) 
μmol/L, respectively. A dose-related increase was observed for lurasidone in the proportion of subjects 
with shifts from normal/low creatinine at baseline to high creatinine at LOCF endpoint. The incidence of 
shifts to high creatinine at LOCF endpoint from normal/low at baseline in the lurasidone 20 mg, 40 mg, 
80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg dose groups were 1.4%, 1.9%,2.2%, 5.0%, and 7.3%, respectively. 
In the long-term, active comparator-controlled studies (P23LTC), mean (SD) changes in creatinine 
(from Baseline to LOCF endpoint) were observed in all treatment groups: 2.86 (17.98) μmol/L, 0.27 
(13.15) μmol/L, and 3.03 (15.34) μmol/L for the lurasidone flex, risperidone flex, and quetiapine XR 
flex treatment groups, respectively. 
Lipid parameters 
In the short-term placebo-controlled studies (P23STC group), the mean change from baseline to LOCF 
endpoint for total fasting cholesterol and for fasting triglycerides were very close to the placebo group. 
In the long-term, active comparator-controlled studies (P23LTC), mean (SD) change in total fasting 
cholesterol from baseline to LOCF for lurasidone flex was -0.08 (0.78) mmol/l, compared to -0.12 
(0.89) mmol/l for risperidone treated subjects and - 0.21 (0.91) mmol/l for quetiapine XR. 
Mean (SD) change in total fasting triglycerides from baseline to LOCF for lurasidone flex was -0.08 
(0.84) mmol/l, compared to 0.10 (1.17) mmol/l for risperidone treated subjects and -0.19 (1.05) 
mmol/l for quetiapine XR. 
Glucose levels 
In short-term placebo-controlled studies (P23STC group), for fasting glucose, the mean (SD) change 
from baseline to LOCF endpoint for all lurasidone-treated subjects and subjects in the placebo group 
was 0.07 (1.19) mmol/L and 0.03 (1.17) mmol/L, respectively. The corresponding changes for the 
comparators were -0.19 (1.04) mmol/L (haloperidol 10mg), 0.49 (1.75) mmol/L (olanzapine 15 mg), 
0.43 (1.19) mmol/L (quetiapine XR 600 mg), 0.06 (0.53) mmol/L (risperidone 4 mg). 
In the long-term active controlled studies (P23LTC), there were small mean (SD) changes in fasting 
glucose across treatment groups from baseline to LOCF: 0.11 (1.21) mmol/L, 0.24 (1.03) mmol/L, and 
-0.10 (1.23) mmol/L for the lurasidone flex, risperidone flex, and quetiapine XR flex treatment groups, 
respectively. 
Prolactin 
In the short-term, placebo-controlled studies (P23STC), there was a trend for increase in prolactin with 
increasing lurasidone dose. The median values from baseline to LOCF endpoint were: -49.78 pmol/L 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 128/147 
 
 
(20 mg), -61.00 pmol/L (40 mg), -6.52 pmol/L (80 mg), 143.00 pmol/L (120 mg), and 130.43 pmol/L 
(160 mg). 
The incidence of markedly abnormally high (MAV) prolactin values (≥5xULN) in the P23STC grouping 
was 2.7 % in lurasidone-treated subjects and 1.0 % for placebo.  
In the long-term, active comparator-controlled studies (P23LTC), median values from baseline to LOCF 
endpoint were -8.00 pmol/L (lurasidone flex), 385.00 pmol/L (risperidone flex), and -17.39 pmol/L 
(quetiapine XR flex). The incidence of markedly abnormally high prolactin values (≥5xULN) in the 
overall P23LTC study grouping was 2.0%, 4.0 % and 1.4 % in the lurasidone flex, risperidone flex and 
quetiapine XR flex groups, respectively. The proportion of male subjects that met the criteria for 
markedly abnormal prolactin was consistently lower than for female subjects. 
In the 22 controlled and uncontrolled studies (P23ALL), treatment-emergent adverse events of “blood 
prolactin increased” and “blood prolactin abnormal” occurred in 100 (3.1 %) and 1 (<0.1%) of 
subjects treated with lurasidone, respectively. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender, race and geographic region 
In general there were no important differences in the safety profile by gender or race. For geographic 
region, however, in the short-term placebo-controlled studies (P23STC), there was in general a lower 
rate of AEs in studies conducted in Europe compared with other regions. For some SOCs differences 
were substantial, for example ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ which occurred at a rate of 40.1 % in North 
America, 31.6 % in Asia, 27.0 % in South America and only 8.3 % in Europe. The corresponding rates 
for “musculosceletal disorders” were 18.2 %, 16.2 %, 10.3 % vs. only 0.9 % for Europe.  
The reason for the low incidence of certain side effects in Europe compared with other geographical 
regions might have been related to extrinsic factors, such as medical practice, life style, including 
social or cultural environment, and disease definition. 
Children 
No children or adolescents were included in the lurasidone clinical studies. 
Elderly 
In the P23STC group, the total safety population comprised 2594 subjects. Of the lurasidone-treated 
subjects in P23STC, 2 % (n=29) were 65 years of age or older. In P23ALL, the subject age ranged 
from 18 to 74 years. The total number of subjects > 65 years was 72 in the schizophrenia clinical 
program. 
Out of the 72 elderly subjects, 51 (72%) subjects experienced a total of 175 TEAEs across the 
schizophrenia clinical program. Of those 175 AEs, 75 were considered lurasidone drug-related. The 
gastrointestinal disorders SOC was most frequently reported, followed by nervous system disorders 
and then investigations SOC. The most frequently reported lurasidone drug-related AEs included 
increased blood prolactin, vomiting, and somnolence. Mean (SD) time to onset for the most common 
nervous system disorders was 9.8 (10.9) days (range, 1-41 days) and they lasted 10.6 (19.1) days 
(range, 1-91 days). 
There were no clinically significant ECG findings noted. No subject older than 65 years had a corrected 
QTc using Bazett’s correction or Fridericia’s correction value >500 msec. 
Four SAEs were reported in elderly subjects. Three subjects were admitted to hospital due to 
exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and the 4th SAE was a fatal case in a 73-year-old female 
Latuda

Page 129/147 
 
 
(lurasidone 80 mg) who died suddenly. The subject had suffered myocardial infarction years earlier. 
Possible causes of death included pulmonary embolus and myocardial infarction. 
Pregnancy  
There are no studies of lurasidone in pregnant woman. Six confirmed pregnancies were reported in the 
clinical studies as of the 30 June 2012 cut-off; all 6 subjects were known to have been treated with 
lurasidone. For two of the pregnancies, the outcome is unknown. One pregnancy ended in spontaneous 
abortion and one in elective abortion. One pregnant woman developed pre-eclampsia and this resulted 
in premature delivery. One child was delivered by C-section as per previous births, there were no 
complications. 
The applicants proposed SmPC for lurasidone states in section 4.6 that there are no data from the use 
of lurasidone in pregnant women and that lurasidone should be used during pregnancy only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. The proposed SmPC also includes the warning 
agreed by the PhVWP in September 2011 on the need to carefully monitor neonates following exposure 
to antipsychotics in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Hepatic impairment

Renal impairment 
Please see section on Pharmacokinetics. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant conducted several clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutical studies to examine the 
effect of extrinsic factors (e.g., food, other drugs) on the administration of lurasidone. Results of these 
studies showed that in the presence of food, lurasidone is associated with a 3.0-fold increase in mean 
Cmax and a 2.2-fold increase in mean AUC. In clinical studies, subjects were instructed to take their 
daily dose with food.  
Lurasidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 
enzymes, and an interaction of lurasidone with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes 
is unlikely. CYP3A4, however, is responsible for lurasidone metabolism, and an interaction of 
lurasidone with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers has been demonstrated. Lurasidone is contraindicated 
with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketokonazole) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin). When 
lurasidone is given in combination with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor like diltiazem, a lower starting 
dose (20 mg) should be used and the maximum dose of lurasidone should not exceed 80 mg once 
daily.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the short-term, phase 2/3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (P23STC), 240 subjects had 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation: 143 of 1508 (9.5%) lurasidone-treated subjects, 66 of 708 (9.3%) 
placebo-treated subjects, 8 of 72 (11.1%) haloperidol 10 mg-treated subjects, 12 of 122 (9.8%) 
olanzapine 15 mg-treated subjects, 4 of 119 (3.4%) quetiapine XR 600 mg-treated subjects, and 7 of 
65 (10.8%) risperidone 4 mg treated subjects. The 143 lurasidone-treated subjects with TEAEs leading 
to withdrawal were distributed in the following lurasidone dosing groups: 0 lurasidone 20 mg; 48 
(9.9%) lurasidone 40 mg; 47 (8.7%) lurasidone 80 mg; 40 (13.7%) lurasidone 120 mg; and 8 (6.6%) 
lurasidone 160 mg.  
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 130/147 
 
 
The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥3 subjects) leading to discontinuation in lurasidone-treated 
subjects in study group P23STC were in the psychiatric disorders SOC (schizophrenia, 52 [3.4%] 
subjects; psychotic disorder, 13 [0.9%] subjects; agitation, 5 [0.3%] subjects; anxiety, 3 [0.2%] 
subjects; and insomnia, 3 [0.2%] subjects), nervous system disorders SOC (akathisia, 21 [1.4%] 
subjects; dystonia, 7 [0.5%] subjects; and dyskinesia, 3 [0.2%] subjects), investigations SOC (blood 
CPK increased, 4 [0.3%] subjects), and gastrointestinal disorders SOC (nausea, 4 [0.3%] subjects and 
vomiting, 4 [0.3%] subjects). 
Schizophrenia, akathisia, psychotic disorder, dystonia, and agitation were the most frequent TEAEs 
that led to study discontinuation in lurasidone-treated subjects, with an incidence of ≥5 subjects. One 
subject treated with lurasidone 80 mg experienced a TEAE of increased weight gain that led to 
permanent discontinuation from the study. 
In the long-term, phase 2/3, double-blind, active-comparator controlled studies (P23LTC), 115 
subjects had TEAEs leading to discontinuation: 115 of 624 (18.4%) lurasidone flexible dose subjects, 
19 of 85 (22.4%) flexible quetiapine XR, and 32 of 199 (16.1%) flexible risperidone treated subjects. 
Eleven (1.8%) lurasidone flexible dose subjects, 5 (2.5%) flexible risperidone subjects, and 0 flexible 
quetiapine XR treated subjects experienced EPS-related TEAEs with the action taken of discontinuation 
of study medication. One subject only (taking flexible risperidone) experienced metabolic TEAEs with 
the action taken of discontinuation of study medication. 
For the lurasidone flexible dose subjects, the most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥3 subjects) leading 
to discontinuation were in psychiatric disorders SOC (psychotic disorder, 23 [3.7%] subjects; 
schizophrenia, 19 [3.0%] subjects; hallucination, auditory, 4 [0.6%] subjects; suicidal ideation, 4 
[0.6%] subjects), nervous system disorders SOC (akathisia, 6 [1.0%] subjects), and gastrointestinal 
disorders SOC (vomiting, 4 [0.6%] subjects). 
The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥3 subjects) leading to discontinuation in flexible dose 
risperidone subjects were in psychiatric disorders SOC (psychotic disorder, 8 [4.0%] subjects; 
schizophrenia, 5 [2.5%] subjects; insomnia, 3 [1.5%] subjects), nervous system disorders SOC 
(akathisia, 3 [1.5%] subjects), and investigations SOC (ECG QT prolonged, 3 [1.5%] subjects). In the 
flexible quetiapine XR group, the most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥3 subjects) leading to 
discontinuation were in the psychiatric disorders SOC (schizophrenia, 11 [12.9%] subjects and 
psychotic disorder, 6 [7.1%] subjects). 
Post marketing experience 
Lurasidone was approved by the FDA on 28 October 2010 for the treatment of schizophrenia and was 
launched on 07 February 2011 in the United States (US) using the trade name Latuda. Since launch, 
approximately 386,900 prescriptions were issued for Latuda in the US, up to and including 30 June 
2012. Each prescription is assumed to represent a single patient. This represents an approximate 
exposure of 32,241 person-years, assuming 1 month supply per prescription. The total exposure 
number may be underestimated due to the data limitations with dispensed Latuda at institutions or 
hospitals. 
The most commonly reported ADRs were nausea, akathisia, insomnia, rash and anxiety and the most 
commonly reported Serious ADRs were suicidal ideation, convulsion, death NOS, auditory hallucination 
and psychotic disorders. 
There were two reports of QT interval prolongation but one of these reports does not include any other 
information. The other report concerned a 56-year-old male patient who was prescribed 40 mg bid. of 
lurasidone and his QTc interval increased from 472 ms at baseline to 504 ms.  The attending physician 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 131/147 
 
 
considered this to be related to lurasidone and the drug was discontinued. His QT interval returned to 
476 ms. This patient was concurrently receiving unspecified cardiac medications. 
Forty-six reports of angioedema-related terms were reported in the postmarketing setting up to 31 
December 2012, whereby approximately 312,300 patients were exposed to lurasidone in the United 
States, and 607 patients were exposed to lurasidone in Canada. Of the 46 postmarketing reports, 11 
reports were serious, which included 1 report of angioedema, and 35 were nonserious, and included 2 
reports of angioedema.  
In the post-marketing experience up to 30 June 2012, there were no reports identified that were 
associated with a drug interaction.

(d) Discontinuation due to TEAE also includes TEAEs that are associated with relapse event of worsening of 
schizophrenia. 
The incidence of TEAEs occurring in the double-blind safety population was similar between lurasidone 
and placebo-treated subjects, 53.5% and 54.6% respectively. The incidence of EPS-related TEAEs and 
metabolic TEAEs were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The incidence of drug related TEAEs 
was higher in lurasidone-treated subjects 32.6% compared to 25.5% in placebo-treated subjects. SAEs 
and serious drug-related AEs were higher in the placebo-treated subjects. Discontinuation due to 
TEAEs was slightly higher in placebo-treated subjects.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs in this SOC were schizophrenia (7.6%) and insomnia (6.3%). The 
next most frequently affected SOC was nervous system disorders with an incidence of 17 (11.8%), 
with headache (3.5%) and akathisia (2.1%) the most commonly reported TEAEs in this SOC. 
Gastrointestinal disorders was the third most frequently affected SOC (11.1%).

(a) Although a subject may have had 2 or more AEs, the subject is counted only once in a category. 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the placebo-treated subjects, with a rate of 7.8% compared with 
4.2% in lurasidone-treated subjects. The most frequent SAEs occurred in psychiatric disorders SOC, 
with the most frequently reported PTs of schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders, 2.8% and 1.4% 
respectively. 
A single subject, a 48-year-old black female, suffered a fatal event during the open-label phase of the 
study. Cause of death was recorded as sudden cardiac death. The investigator considered the event to 
be not related to lurasidone. 
Other safety findings 
Additionally, metabolic laboratory parameters, prolactin and weight increase were comparable to 
placebo. No abnormal QTc signal was observed with lurasidone treatment. No signal was noted for 
suicidality with lurasidone treatment. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development program for lurasidone included 31 clinical pharmacology studies and 22 
phase 2/3 clinical studies involving 5068 subjects with schizophrenia (3502 treated with lurasidone, 
724 with placebo and 842 treated with other medications). The total exposure to lurasidone in the 
phase 2/3 clinical database was 1,212 person years. The number of patients and the duration of 
treatment for which safety data are available in the all lurasidone treated group fulfils the requirements 
in the guideline on population exposure (ICH E1). However, the number of exposed patients for the 
highest dose group 160 mg/day in the short-term placebo controlled studies was considered to be 
limited. The applicant was therefore asked to provide additional exposure data for subjects treated 
with lurasidone 160 mg/day. In the response the data on exposure in the short-term placebo-
controlled studies (40 mg dose- 61.2 PY, 60 mg dose -59.2 PY, 120 mg dose -31.4 PY and 160 mg -12

Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014)

Page 135/147 
 
 
 
PY) and in the 12-month flexible dose study D1050234 (46.59 PY to 160 mg/day) were provided. The 
total exposure for the 160 mg dose in patients with schizophrenia across all phase I and phase 3 
studies was 58.78 person-years. With the additional information provided by the applicant, the total 
exposure to the 160 mg dose in the lurasidone clinical program was considered acceptable.  
The clinical development did not include paediatric population; however a Paediatric Investigation Plan 
(PIP) for lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia, including a waiver for subsets of the paediatric 
population and deferral of planned studies, has been approved.  
Certain patient groups including patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, active 
epilepsy or Parkinson’s disease were excluded from the clinical studies. However, the postmarketing 
experience for lurasidone in the US is considerable and represents approximately 32,241 person years. 
The CHMP noted also that the exposure in the elderly was limited. The applicant was requested to 
discuss the safety of lurasidone in this population based on the pharmacodynamic data and occurrence 
of adverse events. In the response, the applicant clarified that 72 elderly subjects (≥65 years) were 
exposed to lurasidone with 72 % experiencing 175 TEAEs. The results obtained with elderly subjects 
showed that there was no apparent relationship between the incidence of adverse events and the dose 
of lurasidone. The elderly subjects received mainly low doses of lurasidone in the clinical studies. 
Despite receiving lower doses of lurasidone the elderly experienced a higher rate of adverse events. 
Although generally the safety profile observed for the elderly subjects was similar to that seen in the 
younger population asthenia was prominent at the maximum administered dose of 120 mg, however 
the number of patients exposed was very low (n=5). In conclusion, the applicant acknowledged that 
limited safety information was available for the elderly. This is reflected in the RMP and the product 
information. The evaluation of the lurasidone effects in the elderly will be included in the PASS. 
Overall, the spectrum of adverse drug reactions was similar to that for other approved atypical 
antipsychotic drugs. The most common treatment related adverse drug reactions (with an incidence 
higher than placebo) in the placebo-controlled studies were akathisia, somnolence, sedation, nausea, 
insomnia and vomiting. For akathisia and somnolence as well as dizziness (another common TRAE) the 
incidence was dose-related. The CHMP noted that in the highest dose group of lurasidone (160 
mg/day), adverse drug reactions occurred with an unexpected low frequency in study D1050233. In 
this study lurasidone was administered in the evening which may have lowered the incidence of some 
ADRs. Nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently for lurasidone than for the comparators both in 
the short-term and the long-term controlled studies. 
A thorough QTc (TQT) study was conducted, which was considered inconclusive according to the ICH 
E14 guideline (drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by more than 5 and less than 20 ms). 
There were no patients treated with lurasidone in the TQT study who experienced QTc increase > 60 
ms from baseline or with a QTc > 480 ms. In the clinical development, there were no adverse events 
that could be linked to QT prolongation in the lurasidone short-term or long-term phase 2/3 studies. 
ECG measurements taken at various time points during the lurasidone phase 2/3 clinical programme 
did not show any QTc prolongations exceeding 500 ms. However, post marketing there were two 
reports of QT prolongation exceeding 500 ms. The applicant was requested to discuss the risk of QT 
prolongation when using lurasidone in renal impairment, when drug interactions may occur and when 
lurasidone is co-prescribed with other antipsychotics. In the response, the applicant provided data from 
PBPK modelling for renal impairment and drug interactions, and proposed amendments to the product 
information regarding dosing in renal impairment, warnings on co-administration with antipsychotics 
and in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation. Furthermore, following the CHMP recommendation 
the planned PASS protocol was amended to include all cardiovascular events. 
The applicant was requested to discuss the safety of Lurasidone use when additional antipsychotic 
medication is required, particularly parenteral antipsychotics, in the acute management of psychosis.

The applicant described in more detail the three deaths in patients who received concomitant 
medication, i.e. one death was due to septicaemia, whereas the other two deaths were sudden and the 
causes were not clear. The applicant proposed the appropriate wording in the product information and 
included the evaluation of lurasidone/antipsychotic combination therapy in relation to each safety 
outcome of interest in the PASS protocol. 
During the assessment the CHMP expressed concerns regarding suicidality in lurasidone-treated 
patients. The applicant was asked to discuss the suicidality signal and its relationship to the lurasidone 
safety profile, together with the reasons for the observed low rates of suicide attempt and self-harm in 
relation to the completed suicide rate. The applicant clarified that five of 3202 subjects in the 
lurasidone arms were confirmed to have died as a result of suicide (0,41 per 100 PY). There were 2 
additional deaths in the lurasidone arm for which suicide could not be completely excluded thereby 
increasing the suicide rate to 0.57 per 100 PY. This compared favourably with the suicide rates 
reported for other second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Regarding the reasons for the low 
observed rates of suicide attempt and self-harm in relation to the completed suicide rate in the 
lurasidone studies, the applicant argued that due to the very small completed suicide prevalence 
estimate (0.16% to 0.22%) in the lurasidone clinical program, extrapolation to the ratio of completed 
to attempted sucide/self-harm cited in the literature may be unreliable. One additional factor referred 
to by the applicant was the fact that lurasidone studies excluded subjects with an imminent risk of 
suicide, history of deliberate self-harm and those with personality disorders such as borderline 
personality disorder who have high reported rates of suicidal behaviour. The applicant argued that this 
may further explain the low observed number of suicide attempts compared to number of completed 
suicides. In conclusion, the clinical trial population is likely to have a lower risk of suicidality. The 
applicant will include suicidality as an important potential risk in the RMP. This is considered 
appropriate to address the issue, combined with the proposed warning in the SmPC. 
A moderate dose dependant increase of prolactin was observed for lurasidone, however lower than for 
risperidone 4 mg and haloperidol 10 mg. The increase in prolactin was more pronounced in female 
than in male patients. Endocrinological side effects including galactorrhoea, amenorrhea and erectile 
dysfunction occurred with a low incidence.  
In the short-term placebo-controlled studies increases in creatinine correlated to dose and duration of 
lurasidone treatment were observed. A higher proportion of lurasidone-treated subjects (48.1 %; 
726/1508) than placebo-treated subjects (37.3 %; 264/708) had >10 % increase in serum creatinine 
(S-Cr) at any time point during those studies. The applicant clarified that the increases in creatinine in 
the short term studies were isolated and not accompanied by any other indicators of renal damage. 
The review of the outcomes for those subjects who had a change in creatinine above 10 % of their 
baseline value revealed that in 691/726 subjects the value remained within the reference interval for 
S-Cr, whereas 35 lurasidone-treated subjects had a value greater than the ULN at any time point. In 
most of these 35 subjects where follow-up data are available S-Cr returned to normal with continued 
lurasidone treatment. Additional laboratory investigations in subjects with creatinine increase have not 
indicated any associated renal parenchymal damage, and there were no clinically relevant changes 
from baseline in the urinalysis parameters. Increased serum creatinine has been added as an 
important potential risk to the RMP, and serum creatinine, renal impairment and renal failure has been 
included as outcomes in the proposed PASS. In addition, the applicant included “serum creatinine 
increased” in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Lurasidone had small effects on blood lipids and blood glucose, and produced moderate weight 
increase. 
In response to a question related to orthostatic hypotension during lurasidone treatment the applicant 
provided data from three phase I studies in healthy male volunteers and 2 studies in subjects with 
Latuda 
Assessment report (EMA/113836/2014) 
Rev05.13 
Page 137/147 
 
 
schizophrenia. Three of these studies recorded orthostatic measurements, whilst the other 2 studies 
recorded supine and sitting BP measurements.  Incidences of orthostatic hypotension were observed in 
the 3 phase 1 studies that collected orthostatic BP measurements. The magnitude of the drop in 
systolic and diastolic pressures was in the range of 20-30mm Hg systolic and 10-16mmHg diastolic. No 
apparent relationship was observed between the dose of lurasidone administered and the occurrences 
of orthostatic hypotension reported. Appropriate warnings are proposed in the SmPC.  
There was one SAE of angioedema in the clinical studies, and additional 4 SAEs and 14 non-serious 
AEs of angioedema and related terms reported post-marketing at the time of initial MAA filing. The 
applicant was asked to review all reports of angioedema and related terms in the clinical studies and 
the post-marketing period. The applicant performed a search using Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) 
Angioedema from MedDRA (version15.1). A total of 68 reports of angioedema-related SMQ terms were 
received in the phase 2/3 clinical development program, 10 of which were related to the comparator 
antipsychotic groups and 5 related to placebo. The events occurred most frequently at lurasidone 
doses of 80 mg and 120 mg. Forty-six reports of angioedema-related terms were reported in the 
postmarketing setting up to 31 December 2012, whereby approximately 312,300 patients were 
exposed to lurasidone in the United States, and 607 patients were exposed to lurasidone in Canada. Of 
the 46 postmarketing reports, 11 reports were serious, which included 1 report of angioedema, and 35 
were nonserious, and included 2 reports of angioedema. For some of the reports there were possible 
confounding concomitant medications. Angioedema is included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP and is listed in the section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. Hypersensitivity to lurasidone and the 
excipients is included as a contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
The occurrence of seizures and convulsions in the clinical studies and post-marketing was also 
reviewed by the applicant in response to the committee’s request. For the P23ALL group, convulsions 
occurred in 4 lurasidone-treated subjects between 10-419 days of administration with a dose range of 
20-120 mg/day. All 4 reports were serious and considered related to lurasidone treatment. A total of 
16 post-marketing reports were received of which five reports were not well documented. Four cases 
reported suspect concomitant medications. Two reports were considered life-threatening, and several 
of the events occurred within a relatively short time following initiation of treatment which suggests a 
causal relationship to lurasidone. The applicant has added a statement to the section 4.4 of the 
lurasidone SmPC in line with information for other antipsychotic medications: “… should be used 
cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure 
threshold.” In addition, the applicant included convulsions in section 4.8 of the SmPC and seizures in 
the RMP as an important potential risk. 
In conclusion, from the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-
marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Lurasidone has a spectrum of side effects that is similar to that for other atypical antipsychotic drugs. 
The most common treatment related side effects (with an incidence higher than placebo) in the short-
term placebo-controlled studies were akathisia, somnolence, sedation, nausea, insomnia and vomiting. 
For akathisia, somnolence and another common TRAE dizziness the incidence was dose related. Also 
for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as dystonia, tremor, Parkinsonism and salivary 
hypersecretion there was a trend for dose relation and these AEs occurred with the highest frequency 
in the lurasidone 120 mg/day dose group. The incidence of EPS was in general lower for lurasidone 
than for haloperidol 10 mg. Nausea and vomiting occurred with a higher incidence for lurasidone than 
for the comparators. Effects of lurasidone on blood lipids, glucose and HbA1c were limited, and the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In acute studies differences of about 10 points in PANSS-T change from baseline were shown for 
lurasidone at a dose range of 40 to 120 mg while the highest treatment effect (~15 points) was 
achieved at the highest dose of 160 mg, demonstrated in one clinical study. The short-term treatment 
effect observed based on PANSS-T scores was supported by the congruency in CGI-S results. 
Treatment differences in CGI-scores between baseline and week 6 in study D1050231 comparing the 
efficacy of lurasidone 40 and 120 mg respectively and olanzapine 15 mg to placebo were: LUR 40 mg, 
LS mean (SE) -0.3 (0.1), p=0.012; 120 mg, LS mean (SE) -0.2 (0.1), p=0.075, OLA 15 mg, LS mean 
(SE) -0.5 (0.1), p=<0.001. In the other pivotal placebo- and active controlled short-term study 
D1050233 comparing the effect of lurasidone 80 mg, 160 mg and quetiapine XR 600 mg to placebo, 
CGI-S scores similarly decreased from baseline to end of study, namely LUR 80 mg mean (SE) -0.6 
(0.1), p<0.001; 160 mg mean (SE) -0.8 (0.1), p<0.001 and QUE XR 600 mg -0.8 (0.1), p<0.001.  
In addition, responder rates (≥20%), i.e. improvement in efficacy outcome measures (PANSS-T) 
between baseline and study endpoint were demonstrated at each lurasidone dose (Study D1050231; 
LUR 40 mg, 120 mg and OLA 15 mg: 62% (p=0.054), 60% (p=0.108) and 74% (p=<0.001), 
respectively. In study D1050233, the corresponding ≥20% PANSS-T score reduction from baseline to 
study endpoint at week 6 for the 80 mg and 160 mg lurasidone doses were 65% (p=<0.001), and 
79% (p=<0.001), respectively compared to 79% (p=<0.001) for quetiapine XR and 30% for the 
placebo group. The corresponding response rates calculated as ≥30%, PANSS-T score reduction from 
baseline to study endpoint at week 6 for the 80 mg and 160 mg lurasidone doses were 50% 
(p=0.002), and 63% (p=<0.001), respectively compared to 71% (p=<0.001) for quetiapine XR and 
30% for the placebo group. It was concluded that efficacy of lurasidone at a dose-range of 40 mg to 
160 mg was supported by the pivotal acute placebo- and active comparator trials as well as by the 
complementary more conservative analyses. 
In the long-term lurasidone maintenance of effect studies, PANSS scores declined progressively during 
52 weeks and non-inferiority for time to relapse was supported from post-hoc sensitivity analysis of 
lurasidone (mean dose 125 ±25 mg) compared to quetiapine XR (mean dose 630 ±112 mg) in one 
study. In a second long-term study, non-inferiority was not demonstrated compared to risperidone but 
the study provided support for maintenance of effect based on secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The results from an additional recently finalised randomised withdrawal study demonstrated a 
statistically significant benefit of lurasidone when compared to placebo. Overall, 35% of subjects 
relapsed at some point during the randomised or double-blind phase of the study, with 30% of 
lurasidone subjects and 41% of placebo subjects experiencing a relapse. The Kaplan-Meier estimates 
of relapse at Week 28 were 0.422 and 0.512 for lurasidone and placebo, respectively, and overall there 
was a statistically significant increase in the time to relapse for lurasidone compared with placebo 
(p=0.039). A sensitivity analysis performed using the Cox proportional hazard model for lurasidone vs. 
placebo produced a HR estimate of 0.66 (0.45, 098) and was statistically significant (p=0.041). Other 
efficacy measures demonstrated congruence in trends. Overall, taking the results from all three long-
term studies into account, it was concluded that long-term efficacy for lurasidone has been sufficiently 
demonstrated.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Discontinuation rates were high in both short- and long-term studies and it is questionable if any of the 
analysis (LOCF and MMRM) is conservative enough to address the missing values and even more so in 
studies with small numbers of subjects in the ITT population. The small numbers of subjects 
completing the short-term efficacy study D1050196 questions the validity of the results. In 3 of the 
pivotal short-term studies however, (D1050229, D1050231 and D1050233) the proportion of subjects 
who completed the study was sufficiently large and provided support for the claimed efficacy. Notably, 
there was an inconsistency between studies for each dose group. Furthermore, no dose-dependency in 
treatment effect could be demonstrated although the most prominent effect was shown for the 160 mg 
dose, however shown in one study only. As maximum tolerated dose in patients is not clearly defined 
and doses higher than 160 mg per day were well tolerated the dossier does not present the rationale 
for selecting 160 mg per day as the maximum dose.  
While there is acceptable statistical differentiation from the placebo in the short term studies, the 
clinical relevance of the results was not sufficiently documented in the initial dossier. In two of the 
short term studies (D1050231 and D1050233), an active comparator (Olanzapine and Quetiapine XR 
respectively) was used but the studies were not designed to directly compare the efficacy of these 
comparators with lurasidone. Also the responder analyses in D1050006 and D1050196 did not 
differentiate lurasidone from placebo. In summary, the initially presented information did not allow 
conclusion regarding the clinical relevance of the results either independently or in comparison with 
known treatments and thus additional more conservative analyses were requested. The results 
presented from these analyses were considered acceptable and support the short-term efficacy.  
The initially submitted documentation on long term efficacy included one extension study and one 
safety study with additional efficacy measures. The dedicated long term non-randomised efficacy study 
(D1050234) was found to be subject to bias in patient selection to a degree that the results could not 
be regarded as sufficiently robust. The efficacy results from the active controlled safety study 
(D1050237) did support maintenance of effect although non-inferiority to the comparator was not 
shown. 
Consequently, the results from an ongoing randomised withdrawal long term efficacy study D1050238 
were requested, since these data were considered necessary to sufficiently demonstrate long-term 
efficacy of lurasidone. The study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the time to relapse 
for lurasidone compared with placebo (p=0.039) in the overall population. Other efficacy measures in 
this study also demonstrated congruence in trends. The results were, however, not very robust; the 
number of events was quite low and the statistical significance was lost if the patients censored due to 
informative censoring (i.e. patients that withdrew whilst the study was still running) were counted as 
events (p=0.070). Of the 676 patients that entered the open-label phase of the study, 285 (42%) 
were randomised. In regional subgroup analyses on efficacy in this study there was a statistically 
significant effect demonstrated for EU- but not for US-located patient populations. An explanation for 
this finding was discussed by the applicant. Overall, it was considered that the results from the total 
ITT study population were more relevant than the results for subgroups as purely geographically based 
subgroups might not be biologically distinct, and social factors, such as the healthcare system could 
play a role. In this regard, the overall ITT population based results were considered to be relevant. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The spectrum of adverse drug reactions for lurasidone is similar to that for other atypical antipsychotic 
drugs. The most common treatment-related AEs (with an incidence higher than placebo) in the 
Latuda

placebo-controlled studies were akathisia, somnolence, sedation, nausea, insomnia, vomiting, 
Parkinsonism and dizziness. For akathisia, somnolence and dizziness (another common TRAE) the 
incidence was dose related. Also for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as dystonia, tremor, 
Parkinsonism and salivary hypersecretion there was a trend for dose relation. The incidence of EPS was 
in general lower for lurasidone than for haloperidol 10 mg. Nausea and vomiting occurred more 
frequently for lurasidone than for the comparators both in the short-term and the long-term studies. A 
moderate dose dependant increase in prolactin was observed for lurasidone, however lower than for 
risperidone 4 mg and haloperidol 10 mg.  
Five completed suicides occurred during the development programme and there were 2 other deaths 
where suicide could not have been excluded. The risk for suicide with lurasidone treatment has been 
adequately analysed by the applicant and it was concluded that the suicide rate for lurasidone is of 
similar magnitude as for other second generation antipsychotics. Appropriate warnings have been 
included in the product information.  
A moderate weight-gain was reported from lurasidone treatment, but there were small changes in 
HbA1c, glucose or blood lipids as additional indicators of an increased risk for metabolic effects. 
Hypersensitivity reactions included one SAE of angioedema in the clinical studies, and additional 4 
SAEs and 14 non-serious AEs of angioedema and related terms post-marketing. A thorough QT (TQT) 
study was conducted according to the ICH E14 guideline. No lurasidone-treated subject in this study 
experienced an absolute QTc value above 480 ms or change from baseline QTc more than 60 ms. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The total number of patients and treatment duration for which safety data for lurasidone are available 
fulfil the requirements in the guideline on population exposure (ICH E1). There was an unexpected low 
incidence of adverse drug reactions in the 160 mg/day dose group of lurasidone in one of the short-
term placebo-controlled studies (D1050234) which can be at least partly explained by the fact that this 
study was the only study where lurasidone was administered in the evening.  
The number of elderly subjects (>65 years) in the clinical program was low, and certain patient groups 
including patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, active epilepsy or Parkinson’s 
disease were excluded from the clinical studies which limits the generalisability of the results.  
In the lurasidone short-term studies there were slight dose-related increases in serum creatinine. The 
increases in creatinine were isolated and not accompanied by other indicators of renal parenchymal 
damage. The results of in vitro studies performed by the applicant clarified that the increase in serum 
creatinine levels was not attributable to the inhibition of the renal transporters involved in creatinine 
clearance. The applicant’s clinical data review has indicated that the observed serum creatinine values 
were not sustained and in the majority returned to within normal limits even when subjects were 
continuing to receive lurasidone. Increased serum creatinine is added as an important potential risk to 
the RMP, and serum creatinine, renal impairment and renal failure are included as outcomes in a 
proposed PASS. 
There were no clear differences by gender or race with regard to tolerability or safety in the clinical 
studies. Of note however, exposure to lurasidone was 1.5 times higher in the Asian population and 1.7 
times higher in Asian females than in White males suggesting a possible need for dose adjustments in 
the Asian population. However, supplementary information provided showed that there is no need for 
dose adjustments in Asian females.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The results of the clinical short-term studies support an effect of lurasidone at the 40-160 mg dose 
range proposed for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. No consistent 
dose-response relationship was observed. Responder rates (≥20% and ≥30%) showed a statistically 
significant effect of lurasidone treatment however with some inconsistency for the 120 mg dose. Given 
the high discontinuation rates in the acute treatment trials complementary more conservative analyses 
were asked for to support the acute treatment results. These post-hoc analyses have provided support 
to the efficacy results seen in the initial analyses.  
To support long-term efficacy, the results from three studies have been submitted. Based on the 
results from these studies, it was concluded that long-term efficacy for lurasidone has been sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
The spectrum of adverse drug reactions for lurasidone is similar to that for other atypical antipsychotic 
drugs and includes extrapyramidal symptoms, nausea, sedation/somnolence, a moderate increase for 
prolactin and weight, and hypersensitivity reactions. The relatively low potential for metabolic effects 
and the absence of profound effects on QTc prolongation are considered as clinically relevant given the 
need for alternative antipsychotic agents with lower propensity to induce such side effects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The quality of the drug substance lurasidone hydrochloride and the film-coated tablets is considered 
acceptable and adequate.  
The presented clinical efficacy data show a short-term effect which is modest. A dose-effect 
relationship has not been clearly demonstrated, however, within the suggested clinical dose-range 40 
mg-160 mg the highest effect has been demonstrated in one study at the maximal daily dose of 160 
mg. Long-term efficacy has been supported by the results from post hoc analyses providing supportive 
evidence, and a recently reported randomised withdrawal study D1050238 which showed an advantage 
of lurasidone over placebo.  
Lurasidone has a spectrum of side effects which is similar to that for other atypical antipsychotic drugs, 
but the safety profile for lurasidone shows some potential advantages with a low tendency for 
metabolic effects and a low propensity to induce QTc prolongation. The most common treatment 
related side effects (with an incidence higher than placebo) in the short-term placebo-controlled 
studies were akathisia, somnolence, sedation, nausea, insomnia and vomiting. For akathisia, 
somnolence and dizziness the incidence was dose related. Also for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
such as dystonia, tremor, Parkinsonism and salivary hypersecretion there was a trend for dose 
relation. The incidence of EPS was in general lower for lurasidone than for haloperidol 10 mg. Nausea 
and vomiting occurred with a higher incidence for lurasidone than for the comparators. Effects of 
lurasidone on blood lipids, glucose and HbA1c were limited, and the effect on weight increase 
moderate, which is considered to indicate a relatively favourable metabolic profile. There were no 
profound effects on QTc prolongation.

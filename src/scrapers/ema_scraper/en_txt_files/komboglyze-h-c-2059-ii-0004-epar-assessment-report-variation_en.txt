2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Saxagliptin  phosphate  is  an  orally  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4). 
DPP-4  inhibitors  act  by  enhancing  the  levels  of  active  incretin  hormones.  These  hormones,  including 
glucagon-like  peptide-1  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide,  are  released  from  the 
intestine in response to a meal and are part of an endogenous system involved in glucose homeostasis.

Saxagliptin was approved for marketing in the  EU  on October 1st  2009 and currently  has  therapeutic 
indications for second line use in combination with metformin, a PPAR-γ agonist, or a sulphonylurea in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Komboglyze  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  product  consisting  of  saxagliptin  +  metformin.  Komboglyze 
was  approved  in  the  EU  on  24  November  2011.The  MAH  submitted  a  clinical  Type  II  Variation  to 
extend the indication of Komboglyze as follows: 
Komboglyze is also indicated in combination with insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients aged 18 years and 
older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control. 
The  clinical  program  to  support  the  use  of  Komboglyze  in  combination  therapy  with  insulin  was 
developed  in  accordance  with  the  2002  ‘Notes  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigations  of  Medicinal 
Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus’ (CPMP/EWP/1080/00, May 2002). 
This submission consisted of 1 pivotal Phase 3b controlled clinical study, CV181057 (Study 57), which 
evaluated saxagliptin as add-on therapy to insulin with or without metformin.  Study 57 included a 24-
week double-blind short-term (ST) period plus an additional 28-week long term (LT) extension period. 
The data of study 57 was already submitted previously in support of a variation of Onglyza for the use 
of  saxagliptin  in  combination  with  insulin,  with  or  without  metformin  (see  Type  II  variation 
EMEA/H/C/001039/II/0011,  CHMP  positive  opinion  dated  20  October  2011).    The  European 
Commission Decision was granted on 22 November 2011. 
This application is therefore based to a considerable part on the data already submitted by the MAH for 
Onglyza  (saxagliptin)  as  part  of  the  extension  of  indication  as  add-on  to  insulin  (variation 
EMEA/H/C/001039/II/0011).  The  MAH  also  included  in  this  submission  the  long-term  data  that  were 
submitted during the evaluation of Onglyza variation II/011. For Onglyza the indication was as add-on 
therapy  to  insulin  both  with  or  without  metformin.  Therefore  within  this  submission  for  Komboglyze, 
the combination with metformin is particularly emphasized. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision  on 
the granting of a product-specific waiver for saxagliptin/metformin (P/240/2009). 
GCP 
The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has provided 
a  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  clinical  trial  conducted  outside  the  community  was  carried  out  in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.2.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
The clinical program to evaluate the anti-hyperglycaemic activity of saxagliptin as add on combination 
therapy  with  insulin  in  T2DM  is  supported  by  data  from  the  Phase  3b  study  CV181057  (study  57).  
Study 57 was a randomized, parallel, double-blind placebo controlled, multicenter trial that compared 
the  anti-hyperglycaemic  activity  of  saxagliptin  5  mg  added  as  combination  therapy  with  insulin  or  to 
insulin  in  combination  with  metformin  in  subjects  with  T2DM  who  had  inadequate  glycaemic  control.  
The  24-week  double-blind  ST  treatment  period  provides  efficacy  and  safety  data  to  support  the 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04

proposed  indication;  the  28-week  LT  extension  for  this  study  provides  additional  supportive  efficacy 
and safety data from 402 subjects. 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The main study for this application is study 057. 
Study design 
Study  057  was  a  Phase  3b,  randomized,  two-arm,  parallel,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
multicenter  trial  comparing  the  antihyperglycaemic  activity  of  saxagliptin  added  as  combination 
therapy  with  insulin  or  to  insulin  in  combination  with  metformin  in  subjects  withT2DM  who  had 
inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥  7.5%  and  ≤  11.0%)  while  on  a  stable  dose  of  insulin  (≥  30 
units/day,  ≤  150  units/day)  or  a  stable  dose  of  insulin  (≥  30  units/day,  ≤150  units/day)  in 
combination  with  a  stable  dose  of  metformin  for  at  least  8  weeks.  The  ST  treatment  period  was  24 
weeks. The 24-week double-blind ST treatment period provides efficacy and safety data to support the 
proposed  indication;  the  28-week  LT  extension  for  this  study  provides  additional  supportive  efficacy 
and  safety  data  from  402  subjects.  Randomization  was  2:1  (saxagliptin:  placebo),  and  was  stratified 
by  metformin  use  at  enrolment.  The  proportion  of  subjects  using  metformin  was  capped  at  75%  of 
total sample, to ensure sufficient participation of those on insulin monotherapy. The usual clinical dose 
of 5 mg once daily of saxagliptin was administered in this study. See Figure 1. 
Figure 1: design of study 057 
Study population 
The population of study 057 consisted of male and female subjects with T2DM, aged between 18 and 
78  years  (inclusive),  who  had  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (defined  as  HbA1c  levels  ≥  7.5%  and  ≤ 
11.0%)  and  were  on  insulin  alone  [(≥  30  units/day,  ≤  150  units/day)  with  ≤  20%  variation  in  total 
daily dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening] or in combination with metformin.

Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study 057 was the change in HbA1c level from baseline until Week 24 
(or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24, if no Week 24 measurement was available or 
before rescue).  
Secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 were:  
  Change from baseline in AUC from 0 to 180 minutes for postprandial glucose response to an MTT; 
  Change from baseline in the 120-minute postprandial glucose value during an MTT; 
  Change from baseline in FPG; 
 
Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined asHbA1c < 7%); 
  Change  from  baseline  in  mean  total  daily  insulin  dose  based  on  information  recorded  on  the 
subjects’ daily diary. 
Other  efficacy  endpoints  were  the  changes  from  baseline  to  week  24  for  the  postprandial  glucagon 
AUC, postprandial C-peptide AUC, fasting glucagon, and fasting C-peptide. 
Statistical analysis 
With a total of 390 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg (260 subjects) or placebo (130 
subjects), there was 90% power to detect a difference in A1C mean change from baseline to Week 24 
of 0.35% between saxagliptin and placebo, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0%. Assuming a drop 
out  rate  of  10%,  a  total  of  435  subjects  (290  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  arm  and  145 
subjects in the placebo treatment arm) were to be randomized. 
Analysis populations 
The  Lead-in  Subjects  Data  Set  included  data  collected  from  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of 
placebo lead-in study medication. 
The  Randomized  Subjects  Data  Set  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of 
double-blind treatment. 
The  Evaluable  Subjects  Data  Set  (called  the  “Secondary  Efficacy  Data  Set”  in  the  protocol)  was  a 
subset  of  the  Randomized  Subjects  Data  Set.  It  consisted  of  subjects  who  did  not  deviate  from  the 
terms  of  the  protocol  in  ways  which  could  have  affected  the  primary  endpoint  in  a  relevant  way 
(“relevant  deviation”),  as  specified  in  the  pre-defined  protocol  deviation  list  prior  to  unblinding  the 
study. Only the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in A1C, demographics, and baseline 
diabetes-related characteristics were to be analysed using the Evaluable Subjects Data Set, and only if 
>10% of the subjects in any treatment group were found to have a relevant deviation. 
The  Treated  Subjects  Data  Set  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind 
study drug during the short-term treatment period. 
Efficacy analysis 
In calculating primary and secondary endpoints in rescued subjects, endpoints (except mean total daily 
dose of insulin [MTDDI]) were analysed by last observation carried forward (LOCF), as follows: 
  Rescue  because  of  increased  fasting  plasma  glucose:  For  subjects  rescued  because  of  increased 
fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG)  levels,  measurements  obtained  after  rescue  were  not  considered  in 
the analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. Rather, the last observations prior to rescue 
were carried forward (LOCF).

EMA/70628/2013  
Page 5/32 
 
 
 
 
 
  Rescue  because  of  increased  insulin  use:  For  subjects  rescued  because  of  persistently  increased 
use  of  insulin  (MTDDI  exceeding  by  >  20%  the  subject’s  baseline  MTDDI),  the  last  observations 
prior to rescue and prior to the visit with the 20% increase in MTDDI were carried forward (LOCF). 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24.  The  primary 
efficacy  analysis  was  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  of  that  endpoint  (LOCF),  with  treatment 
group and metformin use at enrolment as fixed effects, and baseline value as a covariate in the model. 
It  included  subjects  in  the  Randomized  Data  Set  who  had  HbA1c  assessments  at  baseline  and  post-
baseline (excluding any post-rescue assessments). Within the framework of the ANCOVA model, point 
estimates  and  95%  CIs  for  the  mean  changes  between  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  the 
placebo treatment group were calculated. Each comparison of the saxagliptin treatment group versus 
the placebo treatment group was performed using a t test at α=0.05 level. The treatment-by-baseline 
interaction was tested and distributional assumptions were assessed. 
To  assess  the  robustness  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  modelling  of  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis was repeated in a number of sensitivity analyses. 
The  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  proceeded  in  a  sequential 
manner to control the overall type I (family-wise) error rate at the 0.05 level. The significance or non-
significance  of  the  treatment  comparisons  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  determined  which 
statistical tests were performed to compare treatments for the secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Overall,  the  design  of  the  study  was  considered  adequate  to  evaluate  the  value  of  saxagliptin  when 
added to insulin. Primary and secondary endpoints were adequate. The inclusion criterion of metformin 
dose  ≥  1500  mg/day  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  previous  studies  of  saxagliptin  and  other 
antidiabetic  agents  and  is  acceptable.  The  mean  dose  of  >1800  mg  is  acceptable.  The  chosen 
superiority margin of 0.35% was considered rather small by CHMP but found to be acceptable in this 
clinical context.Results

Disposition of subjects 
Figure 2, Table 1 and Table 2. Of the 500 subjects who entered the lead-in period, 45 did not enter the 
double-blind  treatment  period,  including  2  subjects  who  were  randomized  but  not  treated.  The  most 
common reason for subjects discontinuing during the lead-in period was that the subjects did not meet 
study criteria (30 subjects, 6.0%). Of the 455 subjects who were randomized and treated with double-
blind  therapy,  402  (88%)  subjects  completed  24-weeks  of  treatment.    A  total  of  304  subjects  were 
randomized  to  saxagliptin  and  151  were  randomized  to  placebo.  Discontinuations  during  the  short-
term  treatment  period  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (11.8%  and  11.3%,  respectively).  The 
most common reason for discontinuation from the short-term treatment period in the saxagliptin group 
was subject withdrew consent (13 subjects, or 4.3%). The most common reasons for discontinuation 
from the placebo group were subject withdrew consent (5 subjects, or 3.3%) and  lost to follow-up (5 
subjects, or 3.3%). Lack of efficacy led to discontinuation in 5 subjects (3, or 1.0%, in the saxagliptin 
group  and  2,  or  1.3%,  in  the  placebo  group).  Discontinuations  during  the  LT-treatment  period  were 
also similar (8.2 versus 6.7% in the saxagliptin resp. placebo group).

Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The 2 treatment groups 
were  generally  well  balanced  for  demographic  and  baseline  diabetes  characteristics.  Of  the  455 
randomized  and  treated  subjects,  41.3%  were  men  and  78.0%  were  white;  the  mean  age  was  57.2 
years (range 18 to 77 years). Most (84.6%) subjects were diagnosed with T2DM ≥5 years before the 
start  of  the  study  with  a  mean  duration  of  diabetes  of  12.0  years.  The  mean  baseline  HbA1c  was 
8.66% (range, 7.3% to 11.4%). 
Demographic  characteristics  were  also  examined  for  the  314  subjects  taking  metformin  and  the  141 
subjects  not  taking  metformin.  Among  subjects  taking  metformin  41.7%  were  male,  76.4%  were 
white, and the mean age was 56.7 years (range 18 to 77 years). Among subjects not taking metformin 
40.4%  were  male,  81.6%  were  white,  and  the  mean  age  was  58.4  years  (range  29  to  77  years). 
Overall,  baseline  diabetes  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  those  taking  metformin  and 
those not taking concomitant metformin.

There  were  no  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  percentages  of  patients  who  completed  the 
study  and  percentage  of  withdrawals.  In  addition,  there  were  no  relevant  differences  between 
treatment  groups  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics.  Most  patients  were  White 
(78%), 20% were from  North America, 20% from  Latin America, 40% from  Europe, 11% from  Asia. 
Baseline disease characteristics were typical for T2DM patients. Sixty-eight per cent (68%) of patients 
were metformin users. 
According to the inclusion criteria, baseline HbA1C was supposed to be ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0% and the 
MTDDI ≥ 30 units/day, ≤150 units/day. However, according to  Table 4, patients had baseline HbA1C 
values ranging from 7.3- 11.4%, and in the saxagliptin group the minimum insulin dose was 19 units.  
During the extension of indication  procedure with Onglyza (variation II/011), the MAH was requested 
by  the  CHMP  to  explain  the  differences  observed,  and  stated  that  here  could  be  slight  differences  in 
HbA1c  between  screening  or  Day  -5  and  baseline,  resulting  in  a  baseline  value  just  outside  the 
required  range,  and  that  all  randomised  subjects  but  1  had  baseline  mean  total  daily  dose  of  insulin 
(MTDD1)  values  within  the  specified  range  of  >=30  to  <=  150  units/day.  These  answers  were 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  study  057  are  summarized  by  treatment  group  in 
Table  5.  Overall,  study  057  showed  that  saxagliptin  added  on  to  insulin  (or  to  insulin  combined  with 
metformin)  improves  glycaemic  control  in  subjects  with  T2DM.  There  was  a  statistically  significant 
reduction  in  adjusted  mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment 
group compared with placebo (p<0.0001). The adjusted mean change from baseline was -0.73% (95% 
CI [-0.83, -0.62]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.32% (95% CI [-0.46, -0.17]) for placebo. 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.59, 
-0.24]).

Changes over time are shown in Figure  3. For saxagliptin, a reduction from baseline was observed at 
Weeks 4 and 8 and became progressively greater to Week 12; this reduction was maintained through 
Week  24.  For  placebo,  smaller  reductions  were  observed  from  Weeks  4  to  12  and  values  stabilized 
after that point through Week 24. 
Figure 3: HbA1c mean change from baseline (LOCF) over time during ST treatment 
period, Study 057 
Similar  results  were  obtained  when  examining  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  results  at  Week  24 
regardless  of  rescue.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  HbA1c  (regardless  of  rescue) 
was  - 0.76%  (95%  CI  [-0.87,  -0.66])  for  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  -0.40%  (95%  CI  [-
0.54,  -0.25])  for  placebo.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo 
was -0.37% (95% CI [-0.54, -0.19]). 
When examining HbA1c data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose, there was a reduction in 
adjusted  mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group 
compared  with  placebo.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.71%  (95%  CI  [-
0.81,  - 0.61])  for  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  -0.25%  (95%  CI  [-0.40,  -0.11])  for  placebo. 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.46% (95% CI [-0.63, 
-0.29]). These results were consistent with those obtained for the main analysis. 
Change from baseline in HbA1c in subgroups based on metformin use (ST treatment period) 
Results  for  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  were  similar  in  subjects  with  and 
without metformin use at baseline (see Table 6). Among subjects with metformin use at baseline, the 
adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.79%  (95%  CI  [-0.91,  -0.67])  for  the  saxagliptin 
treatment group and -0.38% (95% CI [-0.55, -0.21]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean

change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  -0.41%  (95%  CI  [-0.62,  -0.20]).  Among  subjects  with  no 
metformin  use  at  baseline,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.67%  (95%  CI  [-
0.84, - 0.49]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.25% (95% CI [-0.51, 0.00]) for placebo. The 
difference  in the adjusted mean change from  baseline versus placebo was  -0.41% (95% CI  [-0.72,  -
0.10]). Changes over time are shown in Figure 4.

Secondary endpoints 
Results for secondary endpoints were in line with those of the primary endpoint. 
At  Week  24,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  change  from  baseline  in  postprandial 
glucose  AUC  during  an  MTT  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0011) 
(Table  5).  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  -3829.8 
(95%  CI  [-6122.4,  -1537.1]).  There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  120-minute 
postprandial  glucose  concentration  when  examining  results  for  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24 
(p=0.0016)(Table 5). The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -
23.0 mg/dL (-1.3 mmol/L) (95% CI [-37.2, -8.7 mg/dL; -2.1, -0.5 mmol/L]). 
Saxagliptin was associated with a numerically greater decrease in adjusted mean change from baseline 
in  FPG  compared  with  placebo  (-4.02  mg/dL,  -0.2  mmol/L),  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant (p= 0.3958; 95% CI [-13.32, 5.28 mg/dL; -0.7, 0.3 mmol/L]) (Table 5). When examining 
data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the reduction in 
adjusted mean change in FPG from baseline to Week 24 was greater in the saxagliptin treatment group 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04 
EMA/70628/2013  
Page 15/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus 
placebo was -12.94 mg/dL (-0.7 mmol/L) (95% CI[-22.27, -3.61 mg/dL; -1.2, -0.2 mmol/L]). 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  saxagliptin  achieved  a  therapeutic  glycaemic  response 
(defined  as  HbA1c  <  7.0%)  adjusted  for  baseline  HbA1c  relative  to  placebo  (17.3%  versus  6.7%) 
(Table  5).  The  difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <  7%versus  placebo  was 
10.6%  (95%  CI  [4.7,  16.5]).  The  absence  of  statistical  significance  on  the  prior  secondary  endpoint 
(FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 
95%  CI  for  the  difference  for  the  proportions  in  the  2  treatment  groups  did  not  include  0.The 
difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <  7%  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
than the placebo group regardless of whether subjects were receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 19.4%; 
placebo: 7.8%) or were not receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 12.8%; placebo: 4.3%). 
Mean total daily insulin dose increased from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in both treatment groups. The 
adjusted mean increase from baseline in MTDDI was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units; 95% CI 
[0.3, 3.0]) than the placebo group (5.0 units; 95% CI [3.1, 6.9]) at Week 24 (Table 5). The difference 
in the adjusted mean change from baseline in the total daily dose of insulin versus placebo was  -3.3 
units  (95%  CI  [-5.6,  -1.1]).  The  absence  of  statistical  significance  on  the  prior  secondary  endpoint 
(FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 
95% CI for the difference in the insulin dose in the 2 treatment groups did not include 0. 
Other efficacy endpoints 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting C-peptide at Week 24 (saxagliptin 
versus placebo) was 0.05 ng/mL (95% CI [-0.18, 0.29]). 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in postprandial C-peptide AUC at Week 24 
(saxagliptin versus placebo) was 5.1 ng*min/mL (95% CI [-50.1, 60.4]). 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting glucagon at Week 24 (saxagliptin 
versus placebo) was -4.53 pg/mL (95% CI [-10.01, 0.95]). 
The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  postprandial  glucagon  AUC  at  Week  24 
(saxagliptin versus placebo) was -1640.2 pg*min/mL (95% CI [-2649.1, -631.2]). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  for  lack  of  glycaemic  control  or  who  were  rescued  for 
meeting pre-specified glycaemic criteria during the short-term treatment period was numerically lower 
in the saxagliptin group at every time point. At Week 24, 22.7% of the saxagliptin treated patients and 
31.8% of the placebo treated patients had discontinued (difference-9.1%; 95% CI [-18.7, 0.7]). 
Physical measurements 
Overall,  there  were  numerical  increases  in  mean  body  weight  (LOCF)  across  both  treatment  groups. 
Baseline  mean  body  weight  was  87.71  kg  for  saxagliptin  treated  subjects  and  86.21  kg  for  placebo 
treated subjects. At Week24, the adjusted mean change in body weight (LOCF) was 0.39 kg (95% CI 
[0.10, 0.69]) for the saxagliptin group and 0.18 kg (95% CI [-0.23, 0.59]) for the placebo group. The 
difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  0.22  kg  (95%  CI[-0.27, 
0.70]). 
Mean BMI values also increased (LOCF) across both treatment groups. Baseline mean BMI was 32.58 
kg/m2 for saxagliptin treated subjects and 31.76 kg/m2 for placebo treated subjects. At Week 24, the 
adjusted mean change in BMI (LOCF) was 0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI [0.05, 0.27]) for the saxagliptin group 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04

Page 16/32 
 
 
 
 
 
and0.05  kg/m2  (95%  CI  [-0.11,  0.20])  for  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean 
change from baseline versus placebo was 0.11 kg/m2 (95% CI [-0.07, 0.30]). 
Overall,  both  primary  and  secondary  parameters  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients 
treated with insulin was effective. The results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use 
at baseline.  However, the effect  was  modest.  For HbA1c, the adjusted mean  difference  from  placebo 
was  -0.41%.  This  was  also  expressed  in  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  therapeutic  glycaemic 
response (HbA1c < 7%): 17.3 vs 6.7% for the saxagliptin and insulin group, respectively. 
Even  though  the  treatment  effect  was  modest,  the  study  demonstrated  that  saxagliptin  +  insulin 
produced a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo + insulin after 24 weeks of 
double-blind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41%. 
The  placebo  group  had  a  reduction  in  HbA1C  of  0.32%,  likely  attributable  to  dietary  and  exercise 
factors, some of which may have extended beyond randomisation.  
Despite  the  addition  of  saxagliptin,  mean  total  insulin  dose  increased  from  baseline  to  week  24. 
However, the mean increase in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units) was lower than in the placebo group 
(5.0 units). 
A  small  increase  in  body  weight  was  seen  in  both  groups  (0.39  kg  versus  0.18  kg  in  the  saxagliptin 
versus placebo group, respectively).  
Efficacy results from the long term extension period of study 057 are listed in a subsequent section. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No strong interactions (p < 0.1) of treatment by subgroup were noted for subgroup analyses of change 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  by  metformin  use,  baseline  HbA1c,  duration  of  diabetes, 
race, gender, age, BMI, or geographic region (see Table 6).

For  some  subgroups  (duration  of  diabetes  ≤1.5  year  and  race  “other”)  the  effect  in  the  saxagliptin 
group was smaller than in the placebo group. However, in these subgroups the number of patients was 
small and the 95% CIs were large. 
With  respect  to  the  geographic  region,  the  difference  from  control  was  -0.29%  in  Europe,  versus  -
0.64%  in Asia,  -0.49%  in North  America and  -0.63%  in Latin America.  There  is a  large  difference  in 
response to placebo, with no effect in Asia, and the largest effect (-0.52%) in Latin America. This was 
raised  as  a  concern  by  the  CHMP  as  part  of  variation  II/011  for  Onglyza.  In  response,  the  MAH 
submitted further details on the number of patients recruited from the EU and the number of patients 
outside  the  EU.  The  efficacy  results  of  these  both  groups  are  compared.  Although  the  placebo-
corrected  mean  reductions  were  numerically  smaller  for  EU  subjects  than  in  the  overall  population 
(also in the individual geographic regions as presented in the ST CSR) and the 95% CI of the placebo-
corrected reduction was wide, there was no evidence of a treatment-by-region interaction in this new 
analysis (p=0.262).  A difference in placebo-corrected response between Asian and European patients 
or Asian and White patients had previously also been observed with another DPP-4 inhibitor.  
Long term efficacy (ST+LT treatment period) 
During the LT treatment period of study 57, all subjects who had not yet been rescued were moved to 
the flexible insulin regimen, while continuing the same study medication. The efficacy analyses in the 
ST+LT  treatment  period  of  study 57  were  generated  based  on  randomised  subjects  regardless  of 
insulin  dose.  In  reporting the  ST  findings,  the  efficacy  analyses  included  only  results  prior  to  rescue, 
which  could  have  led  to  minor  differences  between  Week 24  results  in  the  ST  versus  the  ST+LT 
treatment periods. 
The  effect  of  saxagliptin  treatment  on  HbA1c  was  analyzed  using  the  repeated  measures  analysis 
(mixed  model),  LOCF,  and  observed  values  methodologies.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean 
change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  -0.37%  (95%  CI  [-0.54,  -0.20])  at  Week  24  and  -0.37% 
(95%  CI  [-0.55,  -0.19])  at  Week  52.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  52 
was -0.75% (95% CI [-0.85, -0.64]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.38% (95% CI [-0.53, 
-0.23]) for the placebo group. 
The results from the LOCF analysis were similar to those from the repeated measures analysis.  
The results from subgroup  analyses  by  metformin  use in the ST+LT period were similar to those 
seen  at  Week 24,  i.e.  treatment  with  saxagliptin  5 mg  in  combination  with  insulin  and  metformin 
resulted in HbA1c reductions from baseline at Week 52 (repeated measures analysis) that were similar 
to treatment with saxagliptin plus insulin without metformin. 
Figure 5 presents the mean reductions from baseline HbA1c (repeated measures analysis) during the 
ST+LT treatment period in the subgroup with metformin use.

Figure  5:  HbA1c  (%)  mean  change  from  baseline  (repeated  measures  analysis) 
over  time  during  the  ST+LT  treatment  period  –  Subjects  who  took  metformin  at 
baseline 
At Week 52, the percentages of subjects who had achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c 
<7%)  were  21.3%  for  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  8.7%  for  the  placebo  group  (difference: 
12.6%).  The  difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <7%  was  higher  in  the 
saxagliptin  group  than  the  placebo  group  regardless  of  whether  subjects  were  receiving  metformin 
(saxagliptin:  23.8%;  placebo:  8.7%)  or  were  not  receiving  metformin  (saxagliptin:  16.0%;  placebo: 
8.7%). 
The  effect  of  saxagliptin  treatment on  MTDDI  (mean  total daily  insulin  dose)  was  analyzed  using  the 
repeated  measures  analysis  (mixed  model)  and  LOCF  methodologies.    Both  methodologies  indicated 
increases  from  baseline  in  MTDDI  were  seen  in  both  treatment  groups  through  Week 52,  with 
numerically smaller increases in the saxagliptin group. 
For  subgroups  according  to  metformin  use,  increases  were  seen  in  MTDDI.  However,  the  magnitude 
was  not  similar  between  subgroups  with  metformin  and  without  metformin  use  at  baseline.  Among 
subjects with metformin use at baseline, the increase in the saxagliptin group was 5.2 units and in the 
placebo  group  7.58  units  (difference  in  change  from  baseline  saxagliptin  versus  placebo:  -2.38  units 
(95%  CI  [-5.06,  0.30])).  Among  subjects  with  no  metformin  use  at  baseline,  the  increase  in  the 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04

saxagliptin  group  was  6.78  units  and  in  the  placebo  group  4.71  units  (difference  in  change  from 
baseline saxagliptin versus placebo: +2.06 units (95% CI [-1.94, 6.06])). 
The effect of saxagliptin treatment on body weight was analyzed using the repeated measures analysis 
(mixed model) and LOCF methodologies.  The results from the LOCF analyses for both endpoints were 
similar to those from the repeated measures analysis in that numerical increases from baseline in body 
weight were seen in both treatment groups through Week 52. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients  treated  with  insulin  resulted  in  a  modest,  but  statistically 
significant  decrease  of  HbA1c.  The  maximum  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  reached  at  week  12  and  was 
maintained trough week 24. The mean placebo corrected decrease was  -0.41%. Secondary endpoints 
were in line with this result. 
Results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline. 
In both groups a relative large percentage of patients discontinued because of lack of glycaemic control 
(22.7% vs 32.8% in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively). 
There  were  differences  in  effect  according  to  geographic  region.  These  differences  were  due  to  a 
difference  in  placebo  response,  with  no  effect  of  placebo  in  Asian  patients  and  the  largest  effect  in 
Latin  America  patients.  In  European  patients  the  placebo-corrected  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  very 
modest:  -0.29%.  However,  a  difference  in  placebo-corrected  response  between  Asian  and  European 
patients  or  Asian  and  White  patients  has  also  been  observed  with  another  DPP-4  inhibitor.  In  study 
057, there was no significant difference in placebo-corrected HbA1c between White patients and Asian 
patients, perhaps  because of the inclusion  of  Latin American patients who had both a large response 
on placebo and on saxagliptin. 
The  placebo  group  already  had  a  reduction  in  HbA1c  of  0.32%,  questioning  whether  subjects  were 
truly  diet/exercise  failures  or  not.  The  possible  main  reasons  are  a  “study  effect”,  i.e.  patients  being 
more aware of their lifestyle and glucose control, and increase in insulin dose. Nevertheless, the study 
demonstrated  that  saxagliptin  plus  insulin  produced  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  HbA1c 
compared to placebo plus insulin after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, with a treatment difference 
of 0.41% compared to the reduction with placebo alone. 
Long-term  data  are  consistent  with  a  sustained  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  HbA1c,  up  to  52 
weeks of treatment. 
2.3.  Clinical safety aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Patient exposure 
In  study  057,  a  total  of  455  subjects  (saxagliptin:  304;  placebo:  151)  received  double-blind  study 
medication during the 52-week ST+LT period. The mean duration of exposure to study medication was 
46.5  weeks  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  46.7  in  the  placebo  group.  A  total  of  402  (88.4%)  of  these 
455 subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment and entered the 28-week LT treatment period and 371 
(81.5%) completed the 52-week ST+LT treatment period.

2.3.2.  Results 
Adverse events 
Saxagliptin  added  to  insulin  therapy  was  well  tolerated  with  a  safety  profile  comparable  to  that  of 
placebo.  The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  similar  between  the  2 
treatment  groups  (Table  7).  The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  at  least  1  AE  during  the 
ST+LT  treatment  period  in  the  saxagliptin-treated  subjects  was  66.4%  and  71.5%  in  the  placebo-
treated subjects.

Table  7  presents AEs (excluding  events of hypoglycaemia) that occurred in ≥ 2% of subjects.  In the 
saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo  group  the  4  most  common  events 
were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis.

The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment 
groups. The safety profile of saxagliptin was comparable to that of placebo. There were no unexpected 
adverse events. 
Several  related  AEs  occurring  in  ≤2  subjects  were  not  included  in  the  SmPC  as  justified  by  the  MAH 
and agreed by CHMP. 
With respect to the adverse  events listed  in Table 8, some of the  adverse events were reported  with 
higher frequencies in the saxagliptin group relative to the placebo group, most of which are included in 
section  4.8  of  the  SmPC,  but  not  all  of  them  (in  particular  the  events  "bronchitis"  and  "arthralgia"). 
During  this  procedure,  the  MAH  clarified  the  methodology  applied  for  inclusion  of  AEs  in  the  SmPC, 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04 
EMA/70628/2013

using  pooled  data  and  a  cut  off  difference  used  for  inclusion  of  AEs  in  section  4.8  and  this  was 
considered to be acceptable by the CHMP.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
One death, as a result of myocardial infarction, was reported during the 24-week ST period in a patient 
taking  saxagliptin.  The  investigator  judged  the  event  of  myocardial  infarction  to  be  very  severe  in 
intensity and considered the event not to be related to the study medication. The patient had a history 
of cardiovascular disease. 
Another  death  occurred  during  the  LT  period  in  a  patient  taking  saxagliptin  but  not  metformin.  The 
investigator  reported  an  SAE  of  intestinal  gangrene  that  was  very  severe  /  grade  IV  in  intensity  and 
judged by investigator as not being related to study medication. 
Other serious adverse events (SAEs) during the ST+LT treatment period of Study 57 were reported for 
a  similar  proportion  of  subjects 
in  the  saxagliptin  (25/304 subjects,  8.2%)  and  placebo 
(13/151 subjects, 8.6%) groups.  Sixteen subjects in the saxagliptin group and also taking metformin 
had SAEs (7.7% of saxagliptin subjects taking metformin); 10 subjects in the placebo group and also 
taking metformin had SAEs (9.5% of placebo subjects taking metformin). 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Twelve  subjects  (9  [3.0%]  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  3 [2.0%]  in  the  placebo  group)  discontinued 
study medication due to AEs during the ST+LT treatment period. Six subjects in the saxagliptin group 
and  also  taking  metformin  had  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (2.9%  of  saxagliptin  subjects  taking 
metformin);  2 subjects  in  the  placebo  group  and  also  taking  metformin  had  SAEs  (1.9%  of  placebo 
subjects taking metformin). 
Most  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  were  reported  to  be  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity.  
Severe or very severe AEs led to discontinuation in 4 subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 subject in 
the placebo group. 
Adverse events of special interest 
AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  were  recorded  and  analysed  separately  from  other  AEs.  Confirmed 
hypoglycaemia  was  defined  by  a  fingerstick  glucose  value  ≤50  mg/dL  (2.8  mmol/L)  with  associated 
hypoglycaemia  symptoms.  The  overall  frequency  of  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  with  associated 
symptoms  during  the  ST+LT  treatment  period  was  7.6%  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  6.6%  in  the 
placebo  group.  During  the  ST+LT  treatment  period,  23  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  (15/209 
[7.2%]  subjects  taking  metformin  and  8/95  [8.4%]  not  taking  metformin)  and  10  subjects  in  the 
placebo  group  (5/105  [4.8%]  subjects  taking  metformin  and  5/46  [10.9%]  subjects  not  taking 
metformin)  had  confirmed  events  of  hypoglycaemia.  Most  of  these  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events 
with  associated  symptoms  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  Five  severe  confirmed  hypoglycaemic 
events were reported: 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group with 4 severe events and 3 (2.0%) 
subjects in the placebo group with 3 severe events.  There were no reports of very severe confirmed 
hypoglycaemic events with associated symptoms. 
A total of 56 (18.4%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 30 (19.9%) subjects in the placebo group 
experienced any hypoglycaemic AE during the ST treatment period and prior to rescue. Overall, during 
the ST+LT treatment period, a total of 69 (22.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 40 (26.5%) 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  a  hypoglycaemic  AE.  These  included  hypoglycaemia  in 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report Komboglyze II-04 
EMA/70628/2013

19.4%  and  24.5%  of  subjects,  and  blood  glucose  decreased  in  4.3%  and  7.3%  of  subjects, 
respectively. Most hypoglycaemic events were of mild or moderate intensity. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  AEs  included  in  the  SOC  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue 
Disorders  was  similar  in  the  saxagliptin  (4.9%)  and  placebo  (5.3%)  groups.  The  most  common  of 
these AEs were allergic dermatitis, skin ulcer, and urticaria each in 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin 
group  and  dermatitis  and  rash  each  in  2  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.Skin-related  AEs 
matching the predefined PTs were reported  for 3  (1.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group (all taking 
metformin) and 1 (0.7%, taking metformin) subject in the placebo group.  All of these AEs were mild 
or moderate in intensity, none were SAEs, and none led to discontinuation. 
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  had  AEs  prior  to  rescue  in  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations 
(saxagliptin: 35.5%; placebo: 41.1%). These AEs most common AEs in this SOC included urinary tract 
infection,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis  and  influenza;  the  incidence  of  these 
events was balanced across the treatment groups.  
One  (0.3%)  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  no  subject  in  the  placebo  group  had  an  AE  of 
Lymphopenia. 
One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had an AE of 
thrombocytopenia prior to rescue. For the subject in the saxagliptin group, the investigator reported 
a non-serious AE of thrombocytopenia for  a platelet count of 39 x103 c/μL  (39 x109 c/L). The study 
medication was interrupted due to the thrombocytopenia, the platelet count returned to normal at the 
next measurement, the event of thrombocytopenia resolved, and the study medication was restarted. 
The  investigator  judged  the  event  to  be  moderate  in  intensity  and  possibly  related  to  the  study 
medication. 
One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo  group had an AE of pedal 
oedema. This AE was mild in intensity, and considered by the investigator not to be related to study 
drug treatment, and was still continuing as of last contact with the subject. 
Six subjects (4 [1.3%] in the saxagliptin group and 2 [1.3%] in the placebo group had cardiovascular 
AEs that were confirmed by an adjudication committee: in the saxagliptin group there were two SAEs 
of acute myocardial infarction, one intestinal gangrene, and one case of acute coronary syndrome. In 
the placebo group there was a SAE of thalamic infarction and a SAE of transient ischaemic attack. 
SAEs  in  3  other  saxagliptin  subjects  (myocardial  ischemia  and  cardiac  failure,  cardiac  failure  in,  and 
hypertension and angina were not confirmed by the adjudication committee. 
None of these AEs were considered by the investigator  to be related to study medication. 
Three  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  1  (0.7%)  subject  in  the  placebo  group  had 
hypersensitivity AEs. Two of these hypersensitivity AEs occurred during the short-term study period, 
both in the saxagliptin group (reported term of allergy symptoms, and urticaria). In the LT period there 
were two cases of urticarial, one in the saxagliptin group and one in the placebo group. 
No subject in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had an AE matching the 
pre-specified preferred terms for pancreatitis. 
Six subjects, 3 (1.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin  group and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group 
had fracture AEs. These included foot fracture in the 2(0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group, ankle 
fracture in 1 (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin  group, and 1 (0.7%) subject each with  hand  fracture, 
humerus fracture, and lower limb fracture in the placebo group. Ankle fracture in the saxagliptin group 
was  an  SAE,  but  none  of  these  fractures  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study 
drug treatment and all resolved within 32 days.

In the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups, 
saxagliptin  group  57  (18.8%)  subjects  and  placebo  group  25  (16.6%)  subjects.  Gastrointestinal-
related AEs by PT reported by ≥2% of subjects in  either treatment group during the ST period were 
constipation (3.9% versus 3.3% in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively), diarrhoea (4.6% 
versus 4.6%, respectively), abdominal pain (2.6% versus 1.3%, respectively), gastritis (2.6% versus 
1.3%, respectively), and nausea (1.6% versus 3.3%, respectively). 
Overall, analysis of adverse events of special interest did not reveal unexpected adverse events. 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  between  the  saxagliptin  group  and  the 
placebo group. 
Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  marked  abnormalities  reported  for  decreased  or  increased  platelets.  For  saxagliptin-
treated  subjects,  marked  abnormalities  were  reported  in  2  (0.7%)  subjects  each  for  decreased 
hemoglobin  and  decreased  hematocrit,  and  for  1  (0.3%)  subject  for  decreased  neutrophils.  For 
placebo-treated  subjects,  marked  abnormalities  were  reported  in  2  (1.3%)  subjects  for  decreased 
hematocrit and 1 (0.7%) subject for decreased leukocytes. 
Marked  abnormalities  of  decreased  lymphocytes  were  noted  for  3  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin 
group  and  2  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  Two  additional  placebo-treated  subjects  had 
baseline (Day -1) lymphocyte counts that were considered to be marked laboratory abnormalities. Of 
these  marked  laboratory  abnormalities,  1  in  the  saxagliptin  group  was  reported  as  an  AE  of 
lymphopenia.  
Increased eosinophils were noted for 9 (3.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 7 (4.7%) subjects 
in the placebo group. 
Alkaline phosphatase levels elevated >1.5 × ULN were noted for 10 (3.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin 
group and 5 (3.3%) subjects in the placebo  group. Additionally,  there were  2  (0.7%) subjects in the 
saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo with alkaline phosphatase levels >3 × baseline 
and  >ULN.  Markedly  abnormal  elevated  ALT  (>3  ×  ULN)  was  reported  for  5  (1.7%)  subjects  in  the 
saxagliptin  group  and  3  (2.0%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  these,  3  saxagliptin-treated  subjects  and  1 
placebo-treated  subject  had  marked  elevations  of  ALT  during  the  ST  treatment  period.  One  (0.7%) 
subject in the placebo group had markedly abnormal elevated total bilirubin (>1.5 × ULN). However, 
no subject had ALT >3 × ULN and a total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN or ALT >3 × ULN and a total bilirubin 
>2 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L) (see CV181057 ST+LT CSR Table 8.7.2). 
Marked abnormalities of elevated AST (> 3 x ULN) were noted for 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin 
group and no subject in the placebo group. 
Six (2.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 2 (1.4%) subjects in the placebo group had marked 
abnormalities of elevated CK >5 × ULN. In most cases these elevations represented a single high value 
and CK levels had returned to within normal limits (or were much lower) by the last recorded value. 
Sixteen subjects (8 [2.7%] in the saxagliptin group and 8 [5.4%] in the placebo group) had  marked 
abnormalities of elevated potassium (≥1.2 × baseline and ≥6.0 mEq/L [6.0 mmol/L]). In most cases, 
these  elevations represented a single high  value and  potassium  levels had  returned to within  normal 
limits by the last recorded value. 
Decreased potassium levels were reported as marked abnormalities (<0.8 × baseline and ≤3.2 mEq/L 
[3.2 mmol/L]) for 3 (1.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) in the placebo group. In all

4 subjects, these decreases represented just 1 or 2 low values and potassium levels had returned to 
within normal limits by the last recorded value. 
The most frequent urinary marked abnormality was urinary WBCs (measured quantitatively),which was 
present  in  35/115  (30.4%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  10/53  (18.9%)  subjects  in  the 
placebo  group.  Marked  abnormalities  of  haematuria  (measured  via  dipstick)  were  seen  in14/297 
(4.7%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  2/146  (1.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  Few 
subjects  had  marked  abnormalities  of  urinary  protein  (8/297  [2.7%]  saxagliptin  subjects  and3/146 
[2.1%] placebo subject) or urinary RBCs (8/53 [15.1%]saxagliptin subjects and 1/31 [3.2%] placebo 
subject. Based on further clarification provided by the MAH, the urine microscopy numerical differences 
in Study CV181057 represents probably a chance variation and this was agreed by CHMP. 
Vital signs 
Of the 227 subjects who had normal ECG tracings at baseline, 15/153 (9.8%) who received saxagliptin 
and  11/74  (14.9%)  who  received  placebo  had  abnormal  tracings  at  Week  52.  A  varying  spectrum  of 
ECG abnormalities was noted over all treatment groups. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
or heart rate in either treatment group during the double blind treatment period. 
In  the  Short-term  study  report,  the  MAH  presented  the  ECG  findings  for  all  patients  who  had  an 
abnormal  ECG  during  lead-in  or  short  term  treatment  period.  The  MAH  had  then  been  requested  to 
present  the  data  for  patients  who  turned  form  normal  ECG  at  baseline  to  abnormal  at  week  24and 
none of the abnormal ECG tracings was found to be of clinical relevance. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
In general saxagliptin was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or new adverse events.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  at  least  1  AE  during  the  ST+LT  treatment  period  in  the 
saxagliptin-treated subjects was 66.4% and 71.5% in the placebo-treated subjects. 
In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo  group  the  4  most  common 
events were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis. 
One death, as a result of myocardial infarction, was reported during the 24-week ST period in a patient 
taking  saxagliptin.  Another  death,  due  to  intestinal  gangrene,  occurred  during  the  LT  period  in  a 
patient  taking  saxagliptin  but  not  metformin.  Both  deaths  were  considered  not  related  to  study 
medication. Cardiovascular events will be monitored closely and the data presented in Periodic Safety 
Update Reports. 
Several related AEs occurring in ≤2 subjects, were not included in the SmPC. However, the MAH had 
given a thorough rationale for why these AEs had not been included and that was accepted by CHMP. 
Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients. 
With respect to vital signs, the MAH had been requested during the procedure to present the data for 
patients who turned from normal ECG at baseline to abnormal at week 24. None of the abnormal ECG 
tracings was found to be of clinical relevance and therefore this was satisfactory for the CHMP.

2.4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH provided the following justification for not submitting an update of the current RMP as part of 
this type II variation: The Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Fixed Dose Combination EU Risk Management 
Plan version 2 (dated 21 September 2011) was updated to include long-term exposure data from study 
CV181057 as well as data on identified and potential risks. Thus, version 2 of the EU RMP appropriately 
summarizes  important  identified  and  potential  risks  for  the  saxagliptin  and  metformin  fixed  dose 
combination  in  the  context  of  the  approved  indications  as  well  as  the  change  in  indication  proposed 
with this type II variation (use in combination with insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus). The 
Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Fixed Dose Combination EU Risk Management Plan version 2 (dated 21 
September  2011)  was  provided  in  the  context  of  the  recent  MAA  submission;  reference  is  therefore 
made to the documents provided in eCTD sequence 0005 (dated 19 October 2011). 
This justification was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
SmPC: 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Komboglyze  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  adult 
patients  aged  18 years  and  older  with  type 2 diabetes  mellitus  inadequately  controlled  on  their 
maximally  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being  treated  with  the  combination  of 
saxagliptin and metformin as separate tablets. 
Komboglyze  is  also  indicated  in  combination  with  insulin  (i.e.,  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an 
adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  adult  patients  aged  18  years  and  older 
with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  when  insulin  and  metformin  alone  do  not  provide  adequate  glycaemic 
control. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
. . . 
For patients switching from separate tablets of saxagliptin and metformin 
Patients  switching  from  separate  tablets  of  saxagliptin  and  metformin  should  receive  the  doses  of 
saxagliptin and metformin already being taken. 
For  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  dual  combination  therapy  of  insulin  and  metformin,  or,  for 
patients controlled on triple combination therapy of insulin, and metformin plus saxagliptin as separate 
tablets. 
The dose  of Komboglyze should provide saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice  daily (5 mg total daily  dose)  and  a 
dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Komboglyze is used in combination 
with insulin, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 
4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Komboglyze  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  type 1 diabetes  mellitus  or  for  the  treatment  of 
diabetic ketoacidosis. 
Komboglyze is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients.

. . . 
Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia 
Insulin is known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce 
the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Komboglyze. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
. . . 
Hypoglycaemia 
. . . 
When  used  as  add-on  to  insulin  (with  or  without  metformin),  the  overall  incidence  of  reported 
hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for Onglyza 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
. . .  
Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin) 
A  total  of  455 patients  with  type 2 diabetes  participated  in  a  24-week  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with a stable 
dose  of  insulin  (baseline  mean:  54.2 Units)  in  patients  with  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c 
≥ 7.5%  and  ≤ 11%)  on  insulin  alone  (n=141)  or  on  insulin  in  combination  with  a  stable  dose  of 
metformin (n=314). Saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin with or without metformin provided significant 
improvements  after  24 weeks  in  HbA1c  and  PPG  compared  with  placebo  add-on  to  insulin  with  or 
without  metformin.  Similar  HbA1c  reductions  versus  placebo  were  achieved  for  patients  receiving 
saxagliptin  5 mg  add-on  to  insulin  regardless  of  metformin  use  (−0.4%  for  both  subgroups). 
Improvements  from  baseline  HbA1c  were  sustained  in  the  saxagliptin  add-on  to  insulin  group 
compared  to  the  placebo  add-on  to  insulin  group  with  or  without  metformin  at  Week 52.  The  HbA1c 
change for the saxagliptin group (n=244) compared to placebo (n=124) was -0.4% at Week 52. 
The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition  minor  editorial  corrections  have  been 
made throughout the Product Information (attachment 1). 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  insulin  or  insulin  plus  metformin  was 
investigated in one clinical study (057). This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 
455 patients, insufficiently controlled by insulin or insulin plus metformin. After screening and lead-in, 
patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg qd or placebo for 24 weeks. After 
this short term period, patients entered a long-term phase of 28 weeks. 
The  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients  treated  with  insulin  or  insulin  plus  metformin  resulted  in  a 
statistically significant decrease of HbA1c. The maximum was reached at week 12 and was maintained 
through week 24. The mean placebo corrected decrease was -0.41%. Secondary endpoints were in line 
with this result. Results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline. 
Mean  total  insulin  dose  increased  from  baseline  to  week  24  in  both  groups.  However,  the  mean 
increase was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units) than in the placebo group (5.0 units).

Placebo-corrected mean reductions from baseline HbA1c were -0.20% [95% CI -0.62% to 0.21%] for 
EU  subjects  and  -0.46%  [95%  CI  -0.65%  to  -0.26%]  for  non-EU  subjects.  Analysis  of  data  did  not 
reveal a treatment-by-region interaction. There was no difference in effect between Whites and Asian 
people. Mean difference from control was -0.44% and -0.46% respectively. 
Long-term  data  are  consistent  with  a  sustained  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  HbA1c,  up  to  52 
weeks of treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  both  groups  a  relatively  large  percentage  of  patients  discontinued  because  of  lack  of  glycaemic 
control (22.7% vs 32.8 in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively). 
There  was  a  relatively  large  reduction  in  HbA1c  of  0.32%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  possible  main 
reasons are a “study effect”, i.e. patients being more aware of their lifestyle and glucose control, and 
increase in insulin dose. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that saxagliptin plus insulin produced a 
statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo plus insulin after 24 weeks of double-
blind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41%. 
Considering the large number of sites and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites, a centre 
effect  could  not  be  excluded.  However,  an  analysis  of  centre  effects  was  not  considered  to  provide 
additional meaningful information due to the large  number of sites and the small number of  subjects 
enrolled at most sites and the MAH’s approach was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In general saxagliptin (in insulin-treated patients with or without metformin) was well tolerated. There 
were no unexpected or new adverse events.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  at  least  1  AE  during  the  ST+LT  treatment  period  in  the 
saxagliptin-treated subjects was 66.4% and 71.5% in the placebo-treated subjects. 
In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo  group  the  4  most  common 
events were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis. 
Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
During  the  short-term  treatment  period,  there  was  one  death  due  to  myocardial  infarction  and  two 
other  cardiovascular-related  SAEs  in  the  saxagliptin  group,  all  considered  unrelated  to  study 
medication. Patients had already a cardiovascular history and/or hypercholesterolemia. 
Another death, due to intestinal gangrene, occurred during the long-term treatment period. This event 
was also not considered related to study drug. 
There  were  3  (1.0%)  subjects  who  reported  skin  or  neuropathic  ulcers  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment 
group.  These  ulcers  were  mild  in  intensity,  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation,  and  resolved  during 
saxagliptin therapy.

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  addition  of  saxagliptin  (in  insulin-treated  patients  with  or  without  metformin)  resulted  in  a 
decrease  in  HbA1c  for  the  whole  population.  However,  in  both  groups  a  relative  large  percentage  of 
patients  discontinued  because  of  lack  of  glycaemic  control  (22.7%  vs  32.8  in  the  saxagliptin  and 
placebo group, respectively).  However, in this heavily treated population with advanced diabetes, the 
total effect was considered sufficient and clinically relevant by CHMP. 
Saxagliptin (in insulin-treated patients with or  without metformin)  was in general well tolerated, with 
no  unexpected  findings,  and  no  more  side  effects  than  the  placebo  treated  patients.  Although  three 
cardiac adverse events were serious, there was no established relation with saxagliptin. Cardiovascular 
adverse events will be closely monitored and reported in PSURs. There were no abnormal ECG tracings 
of clinical importance. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The effect of adding saxagliptin  (in insulin-treated patients with or without metformin)  on HbA1c was 
modest, however considered still clinically relevant for the patient group involved. Treatment was not 
associated  with  an  increase  in  events  of  hypoglycaemia,  and  there  was  slightly  less  of  a  need  to 
increase  the  daily  insulin  dose  over  time  in  the  saxagliptin  group.  Saxagliptin  was  well  tolerated. 
Cardiovascular adverse events will be closely monitored and reported in PSURs. 
Conclusions 
The  benefit  risk  balance  for  Komboglyze  in  the  combined  use  with  insulin  is  considered  positive  by 
CHMP.

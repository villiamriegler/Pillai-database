1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Quinsair EMEA/H/A-31/1452/C/002789/0010 
German National Competent Authority on 1 February 
2017 triggered a referral resulting from 
pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to 
review and assess the risk of long-lasting, disabling, 
and potentially permanent serious adverse drug 
reactions associated with the use of (luoro)quinolones. 
Furthermore, the PRAC was requested to assess the 
impact of this safety concern on the overall 
benefit-risk balance of quinolones and 
fluoroquinolones for systemic and inhalation use and 
the need for adequate risk minimisation measures and 
issue a recommendation on whether the products 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.  
As the request resulted from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the PRAC 
issued a recommendation to the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

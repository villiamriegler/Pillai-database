combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 
16 mg/kg daratumumab dose at Week 1 split over two 
days i.e. 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2 respectively. The 
incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, 
with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related 
reactions on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 
8% with subsequent infusions. The median time to onset of 
a reaction was 1.8 hours (range: 0.1 to 5.4 hours). The 
incidence of infusion interruptions due to reactions was 
30%. Median durations of infusions were 4.2 h for Week 1-

Day 1, 4.2 h for Week 1-Day 2, and 3.4 hours for the 
subsequent infusions. 
Simulation of daratumumab pharmacokinetics was 
conducted for all recommended dosing schedules in 1,309 
patients with multiple myeloma. The simulation results 
confirmed that the split and single dosing for the first dose 
provide similar PK, with the exception of the PK profile in 
the first day of the treatment. 
In conclusion and in order to facilitate administration, the 
first prescribed 16 mg/kg dose of daratumumab at Week 1 
may be split over two consecutive days i.e. 8 mg/kg on 
Day 1 and Day 2, respectively.

Darzalex can cause serious infusion related reactions 
to add anaphylactic reactions with a frequency ‘rare’ 
as new adverse reactions and update of section 4.4 
to complement the existing warning on infusion 
related reactions based on the cumulative review of 
clinical trial and post-marketing data. The Package 
Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to add in section 4.4 the traceability 
statement of biological medicines to bring the 
product information in line with the guideline on 
good pharmacovigilance practices and to add specific 
text relating to the excipient sodium to align the 
product information with the updated published EMA

(IRRs), including anaphylactic reactions. All patients should 
be monitored throughout the infusion for IRRs. For patients 
that experience any Grade IRRs, continue monitoring post-
infusion until symptoms resolve. In clinical trials IRRs were 
reported in approximately half of all patients treated with 
Darzalex. The majority of IRRs occurred at the first infusion 
and were Grade 1-2.  
Patients should be pre medicated with antihistamines, 
antipyretics and corticosteroids to reduce the risk of IRRs 
prior to treatment with Darzalex. Darzalex infusion should 
be interrupted for IRRs of any severity and medical 
management/supportive treatment for IRRs should be 
instituted as needed. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 
IRRs, the infusion rate should be reduced when re starting 
the infusion. If an anaphylactic reaction or life threatening 
(Grade 4) infusion reaction occurs, appropriate emergency 
resuscitation should be initiated immediately. Darzalex 
therapy should be discontinued immediately and 
permanently.

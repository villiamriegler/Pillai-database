through  the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3  (2)  (a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The

EU/1/98/069/008-010).  
Licensing status:

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
Therefore, consent from the MAH of the Plavix application, which was submitted within the scope of 
Part B of the Annex of the Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93, of the 22 July 1993, has been given 
allowing  access  to  Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any 
subsequent  post-marketing  procedures  submitted,  assessed  and  approved.  The  application  for 
Clopidogrel Winthrop consists only of Module 1 information. 
As  a  consequence,  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  Clopidogrel  Winthrop  medicinal  product  are 
identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Plavix. Information on the scientific 
discussions  can  be  found  in  the  Plavix  CHMP  assessment  reports  and  in  the  European  Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The approved indication is:  
Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: 
• 
• 
Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), 
ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial 
disease. 
Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: 
-  Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave 
myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following 
percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). 
ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically 
treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 
- 
Clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg with or without food. In patients suffering 
from non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial 
infarction)  clopidogrel  treatment  should  be  initiated  with  a  single  300-mg  loading  dose  and  then 
continued  at  75 mg  once  a  day  (with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  75 mg-325 mg  daily).  Since  higher 
doses  of  ASA  were  associated  with  higher  bleeding  risk  it  is  recommended  that  the  dose  of  ASA 
should not be higher than 100 mg.  
In  patients  suffering  from  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction  clopidogrel  should  be 
given as a single daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300-mg loading dose in combination with ASA 
and  with  or  without  thrombolytics.  For  patients  over  75 years  of  age  clopidogrel  should  be  initiated 
without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early as possible after symptoms start 
and continued for at least four weeks.  
Clopidogrel  Winthrop  contains  clopidogrel,  which  is  a  prodrug.  The  active  metabolite,  a  thiol 
derivative, is formed by oxidation of clopidogrel to 2-oxo-clopidogrel and subsequent hydrolysis.  
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the quality data in support of 
the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Plavix dossier 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
4/5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the non-clinical data in support 
of the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Plavix 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
An environmental risk assessment was provided. No further request of information is considered 
necessary. 
2.4 
Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the clinical data in support of 
the Clopidogrel Winthrop application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Plavix dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The  CHMP  did  not  require  the  MAA  to  submit  a  risk  management  plan  because  the  aim  of  this 
submission is to obtain a duplicate form of the available clopidogrel brand Plavix, under the name of 
Clopidogrel  Winthrop,  using  the  same  current  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SPC).  In  this 
context,  this  application  does  not  represent  a  significant  change  in  the  marketing  authorisation  of 
clopidogrel,  and  therefore  it  is  not  considered  that  any  specific  Risk  Management  measures  are 
necessary.  
The  current  SPC for  clopidogrel  appropriately  describes the  safety  profile and recommendations for 
the  safe  use  of  this  medicinal  product,  for  which  no  additional  risk  minimization  activities  beyond 
appropriate labelling statements have been deemed necessary since its first marketing authorisations. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Plavix application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit balance of Clopidogrel Winthrop was favourable and therefore recommended the granting 
of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:  
“Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: 
- Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. 
- Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: 
­  Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave 
myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following 
percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). 
­  ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically 
treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.”

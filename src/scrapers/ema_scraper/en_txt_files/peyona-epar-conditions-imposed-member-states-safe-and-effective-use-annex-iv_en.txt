CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED 
BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The  Member  States  shall  agree  with  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  the  final  text  of  a  card 
suitable  for  display  in  neonatal  intensive  care  units.    The  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  card 
contains  the  following  key  elements  and  is  provided  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  to  all 
neonatal intensive care units where the product is likely to be used at launch of the product: 
-  That Peyona is for the treatment of primary apnoea 
-  That  treatment  with  Peyona  must  be  provided  in  a  neonatal intensive care unit and initiated 
and supervised by a physician experienced in neonatal intensive care 
-  Details  of  the  loading  and  maintenance  dosages  and  that  caffeine  may  accumulate  in 
premature neonates because of its long half-life. 
-  That the dose of caffeine expressed as caffeine base is one half the dose of caffeine expressed 
as  caffeine  citrate  (20mg  caffeine  citrate  is  equivalent  to  10mg  caffeine  base)  and  that 
prescriptions should clearly indicate that caffeine citrate is to be administered. 
-  That the product should be used immediately after opening the ampoule and unused portions 
left in the ampoule should be discarded 
-  That baseline plasma levels may need measuring  because of an increased risk of toxicity if 
o  The neonate has been previously treated with theophylline 
o  The mother has been consuming large amounts of caffeine prior to delivery or breast 
feeding 
-  That caffeine and theophylline should not be used concurrently 
-  That if caffeine and doxapram are used concurrently, the patient should be closely monitored 
-  That additional plasma caffeine monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary in at risk 
situations such as preterm infants: 
o  With cholestatic hepatitis 
o  With significant renal impairment 
o  With seizure disorders 
o  With cardiac disease 
o 
less  than  28  weeks  gestational  age  and/or  body  weight  <1000g  particularly  when 
receiving parenteral nutrition 
o  with  co-administration  of  medicinal  products  known  to  interfere  with  caffeine 
metabolism 
-  That  cardiac  disorders  (including  arrhythmias)    may  arise  in  neonates  with  pre-existing 
cardiac disease 
-  That all suspected adverse reactions  should be reported in accordance with national reporting 
requirements 
- 
In  particular,  if  convulsions,  seizures,  necrotising  enterocolitis,  symptoms  and  signs  of 
caffeine  withdrawal,  medically  abnormal  decrease  in  infant  weight  gain  or  interactions  with 
other medicines are suspected as being associated with the use of caffeine citrate, these should 
be reported to <insert local name and address of Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.

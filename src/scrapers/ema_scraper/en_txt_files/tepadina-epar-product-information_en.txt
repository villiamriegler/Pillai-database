Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Studies in renally impaired patients have not been conducted. As thiotepa and its metabolites are 
poorly excreted in the urine, dose modification is not recommended in patients with mild or moderate 
renal insufficiency. However, caution is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).   
Hepatic impairment 
Thiotepa has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since thiotepa is mainly 
metabolized through the liver, caution needs to be exercised when thiotepa is used in patients with pre-
existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. Dose 
modification is not recommended for transient alterations of hepatic parameters (see section 4.4). 
Elderly  
The administration of thiotepa has not been specifically investigated in elderly patients. However, in 
clinical studies, a proportion of patients over the age of 65 received the same cumulative dose as the 
other patients. No dose adjustment was deemed necessary. 
Method of administration 
TEPADINA must be administered by a qualified healthcare professional as a 2-4 hours intravenous 
infusion via a central venous catheter. 
Each vial must be reconstituted with 1.5 mL (TEPADINA 15 mg) or 10 mL (TEPADINA 100 mg) of 
sterile water for injections. The total volume of reconstituted vials to be administered should be further 
diluted in 500 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to administration 
(1 000 mL if the dose is higher than 500 mg). In children, if the dose is lower than 250 mg, an 
appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection may be used in order to 
obtain a final TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. For instructions on reconstitution 
and further dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Topical reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. Therefore, the use of 
gloves is recommended in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts 
the skin, the skin must be immediately thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa 
accidentally contacts mucous membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water (see section 
6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 
Concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and with live virus and bacterial vaccines (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The consequence of treatment with thiotepa at the recommended dose and schedule is profound 
myelosuppression, occurring in all patients. Severe granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia or 
any combination thereof may develop. Frequent complete blood counts, including differential white 
blood cell counts, and platelet counts need to be performed during the treatment and until recovery is 
achieved. Platelet and red blood cell support, as well as the use of growth factors such as Granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), should be employed as medically indicated. Daily white blood cell 
counts and platelet counts are recommended during therapy with thiotepa and after transplant for at 
least 30 days. 
Prophylactic or empiric use of anti-infectives (bacterial, fungal, viral) should be considered for the 
prevention and management of infections during the neutropenic period. 
Thiotepa has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since thiotepa is mainly 
metabolized through the liver, caution needs to be observed when thiotepa is used in patients with pre-
existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. When 
treating such patients it is recommended that serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 
are monitored regularly following transplant, for early detection of hepatotoxicity. 
Patients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of 
chemotherapy, or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk of hepatic veno-occlusive 
disease (see section 4.8). 
Caution must be used in patients with history of cardiac diseases, and cardiac function must be 
monitored regularly in patients receiving thiotepa.  
Caution must be used in patients with history of renal diseases and periodic monitoring of renal 
function should be considered during therapy with thiotepa.  
Thiotepa might induce pulmonary toxicity that may be additive to the effects produced by other 
cytotoxic agents (busulfan, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (see section 4.8). 
Previous brain irradiation or craniospinal irradiation may contribute to severe toxic reactions (e.g. 
encephalopathy). 
The increased risk of a secondary malignancy with thiotepa, a known carcinogen in humans, must be 
explained to the patient. 
Concomitant use with live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever vaccines), phenytoin and 
fosphenytoin is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Thiotepa must not be concurrently administered with cyclophosphamide when both medicinal 
products are present in the same conditioning treatment. TEPADINA must be delivered after the 
completion of any cyclophosphamide infusion (see section 4.5). 
During the concomitant use of thiotepa and inhibitors of CYP2B6 or CYP3A4, patients should be 
carefully monitored clinically (see section 4.5). 
As most alkylating agents, thiotepa might impair male or female fertility. Male patients should seek 
for sperm cryopreservation before therapy is started and should not father a child while treated and 
during the year after cessation of treatment (see section 4.6).

4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Specific interactions with thiotepa  
Live virus and bacterial vaccines must not be administered to a patient receiving an 
immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and at least three months must elapse between 
discontinuation of therapy and vaccination.  
Thiotepa appears to be metabolised via CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Co-administration with inhibitors of 
CYP2B6 (for example clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or CYP3A4 (for example azole antifungals, 
macrolides like erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and protease inhibitors) may increase the 
plasma concentrations of thiotepa and potentially decrease the concentrations of the active metabolite 
TEPA. Co-administration of inducers of cytochrome P450 (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital) may increase the metabolism of thiotepa leading to increased plasma concentrations of 
the active metabolite. Therefore, during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products, 
patients should be carefully monitored clinically. 
Thiotepa is a weak inhibitor for CYP2B6, and may thereby potentially increase plasma concentrations 
of substances metabolised via CYP2B6, such as ifosfamide, tamoxifen, bupropion, efavirenz and 
cyclophosphamide. CYP2B6 catalyzes the metabolic conversion of cyclophosphamide to its active 
form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP) and co-administration of thiotepa may therefore lead to 
decreased concentrations of the active 4-OHCP. Therefore, a clinical monitoring should be exercised 
during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products. 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalized vaccine-induced disease. 
More generally, live virus and bacterial vaccines must not be administered to a patient receiving an 
immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and at least three months must elapse between 
discontinuation of therapy and vaccination. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever): risk of systemic, possibly fatal disease. This risk is 
increased in subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. 
An inactivated virus vaccine should be used instead, whenever possible (poliomyelitis). 
Phenytoin: risk of exacerbation of convulsions resulting from the decrease of phenytoin digestive 
absorption by cytotoxic medicinal product or risk of toxicity enhancement and loss of efficacy of the 
cytotoxic medicinal product due to increased hepatic metabolism by phenytoin. 
Concomitant use to take into consideration 
Ciclosporine, tacrolimus: excessive immunosuppression with risk of lymphoproliferation. 
Alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including thiotepa, inhibit plasma pseudocholinesterase by 35% 
to 70%. The action of succinyl-choline can be prolonged by 5 to 15 minutes. 
Thiotepa must not be concurrently administered with cyclophosphamide when both medicinal 
products are present in the same conditioning treatment. TEPADINA must be delivered after the 
completion of any cyclophosphamide infusion. 
The concomitant use of thiotepa and other myelosuppressive or myelotoxic agents (i.e. 
cyclophosphamide, melphalan, busulfan, fludarabine, treosulfan) may potentiate the risk of 
haematologic adverse reactions due to overlapping toxicity profiles of these medicinal products.

Interaction common to all cytotoxics 
Due to the increase of thrombotic risk in case of malignancy, the use of anticoagulative treatment is 
frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation state during malignancy and the 
potential interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require, if it is decided 
to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants, to increase the frequency of the INR (International 
Normalised Ratio) monitoring. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and a pregnancy 
test should be performed before treatment is started. Male patients should not father a child while 
treated and during the year after cessation of treatment (see section 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of thiotepa during pregnancy. In pre-clinical studies thiotepa, as most 
alkylating agents, has been shown to cause embryofoetal lethality and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). 
Therefore, thiotepa is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Due to its pharmacological properties and 
its potential toxicity for breast-fed newborns/infants, breast-feeding is contraindicated during 
treatment with thiotepa. 
Fertility 
As most alkylating agents, thiotepa might impair male and female fertility. Male patients should seek 
for sperm cryopreservation before therapy is started (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
TEPADINA has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It is likely that certain 
adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could affect these functions.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of thiotepa has been examined through a review of adverse events reported in published 
data from clinical trials. In these studies, a total of 6 588 adult patients and 902 paediatric patients 
received thiotepa for conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.  
Serious toxicities involving the haematologic, hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as 
expected consequences of the conditioning regimen and transplant process. These include infection 
and Graft-versus host disease (GvHD) which, although not directly related, were the major causes of 
morbidity and mortality, especially in allogeneic HPCT. 
The most frequently adverse reactions reported in the different conditioning treatments including 
thiotepa are: infections, cytopenia, acute GvHD and chronic GvHD, gastrointestinal disorders, 
haemorrhagic cystitis and mucosal inflammation. 
Leukoencephalopathy  
Cases  of  leukoencephalopathy  have  been  observed  following  treatment  with  thiotepa  in  adult  and 
paediatric  patients  with  multiple  previous  chemotherapies,  including  methotrexate  and  radiotherapy. 
Some cases had a fatal outcome.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdoses of thiotepa. The most important adverse reactions expected in 
case of overdose is myeloablation and pancytopenia.  
There is no known antidote for thiotepa. 
The haematological status needs to be closely monitored and vigorous supportive measures instituted 
as medically indicated. 
5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, ATC code: L01AC01 
Mechanism of action 
Thiotepa is a polyfunctional cytotoxic agent related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen 
mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylene 
imine radicals that, as in the case of irradiation therapy, disrupt the bonds of DNA, e.g. by alkylation 
of guanine at the N-7, breaking the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberating 
alkylated guanine. 
Clinical safety and efficacy 
The conditioning treatment must provide cytoreduction and ideally disease eradication. Thiotepa has 
marrow ablation as its dose-limiting toxicity, allowing significant dose escalation with the infusion of 
autologous HPCT. In allogeneic HPCT, the conditioning treatment must be sufficiently 
immunosuppressive and myeloablative to overcome host rejection of the graft. Due to its highly 
myeloablative characteristics, thiotepa enhances recipient immunosuppression and myeloablation, thus 
strengthening engraftment; this compensates for the loss of the GvHD-related GvL effects. As 
alkylating agent, thiotepa produces the most profound inhibition of tumour cell growth in vitro with 
the smallest increase in medicinal product concentration. Due to its lack of extramedullary toxicity 
despite dose escalation beyond myelotoxic doses, thiotepa has been used for decades in combination 
with other chemotherapy medicinal products prior to autologous and allogeneic HPCT.  
The results of published clinical studies supporting the efficacy of thiotepa are summarised:

Autologous HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment:  Conditioning treatments including thiotepa have proved to be myeloablative. 
Disease free survival (DFS): An estimated 43% at five years has been reported, confirming that 
conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective therapeutic 
strategies for treating patients with haematological diseases. 
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being 60% or lower, which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy. In some of the conditioning treatments evaluated, relapse rates lower than 60% have also 
been reported at 5 years. 
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 29% to 87% with a follow-up ranging from 22 up to 
63 months. 
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
2.5% to 29% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 21% at 1 year, confirming the safety 
of the conditioning treatment including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in adult patients with 
haematological diseases. 
Solid tumours 
Engraftment: Conditioning treatments including thiotepa have proved to be myeloablative. 
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages reported with follow-up periods of more than 1 year confirm 
that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective choices for 
treating patients with solid tumours. 
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being lower than 60%, which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy. In some cases, relapse rates of 35% and of 45% have been reported at 5 years and 6 years 
respectively. 
Overall survival: OS ranged from 30% to 87% with a follow-up ranging from 11.7 up to 87 months. 
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 2% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 7.4% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatment including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in adult patients with solid tumours. 
Allogeneic HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment: Engraftment has been achieved (92%-100%) in all reported conditioning treatments and 
it was considered to occur at the expected time. Therefore it can be concluded that conditioning 
treatments including thiotepa are myeloablative. 
GvHD (graft versus host disease): all conditioning treatments evaluated assured a low incidence of 
acute GvHD grade III-IV (from 4% to 24%). 
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages reported with follow-up periods of more than 1 year and up 
to 5 years confirm that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following allogeneic HPCT are 
effective choices for treating patients with haematological diseases.  
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being lower than 40% (which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy). In some cases, relapse rates lower than 40% have also been reported at 5 years and 10 years. 
Overall survival: OS ranged from 31% to 81% with a follow-up ranging from 7.3 up to 120 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): low values have been 
reported, confirming the safety of the conditioning treatments including thiotepa for allogeneic HPCT 
in adult patients with haematological diseases. 
Paediatric population 
Autologous HPCT 
Solid tumours 
Engraftment: It has been achieved with all reported conditioning regimens including thiotepa.  
Disease free survival (DFS): With a follow-up of 36 to 57 months, DFS ranged from 46% to 70% in 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the reported studies. Considering that all patients were treated for high risk solid tumours, DFS results 
confirm that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective 
therapeutic strategies for treating paediatric patients with solid tumours.  
Relapse: In all the reported conditioning regimens containing thiotepa, relapse rates at 12 to 57 months 
ranged from 33% to 57%. Considering that all patients suffer of recurrence or poor prognosis solid 
tumours, these rates support the efficacy of conditioning regimens based on thiotepa.  
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 17% to 84% with a follow-up ranging from 12.3 up to 
99.6 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 26.7% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 18% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatments including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in paediatric patients with solid 
tumours. 
Allogeneic HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment:  It has been achieved with all evaluated conditioning regimens including thiotepa with a 
success rate of 96% - 100%. The haematological recovery is in the expected time.  
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages of 40% - 75% with follow-up of more than 1 year have been 
reported. DFS results confirm that conditioning treatment containing thiotepa following allogeneic 
HPCT are effective therapeutic strategies for treating paediatric patients with haematological diseases.  
Relapse: In all the reported conditioning regimens containing thiotepa, the relapse rate was in the 
range of 15% - 44%. These data support the efficacy of conditioning regimens based on thiotepa in all 
haematological diseases. 
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 50% to 100% with a follow-up ranging from 9.4 up to 
121 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 2.5% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 30% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatment including thiotepa for allogeneic HPCT in paediatric patients with 
haematological diseases. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Thiotepa is unreliably absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract: acid instability prevents thiotepa from 
being administered orally.  
Distribution 
Thiotepa is a highly lipophilic compound. After intravenous administration, plasma concentrations of 
the active substance fit a two compartment model with a rapid distribution phase. The volume of 
distribution of thiotepa is large and it has been reported as ranging from 40.8 l/m2 to 75 l/m2, 
indicating distribution to total body water. The apparent volume of distribution of thiotepa appears 
independent of the administered dose. The fraction unbound to proteins in plasma is 70-90%; 
insignificant binding of thiotepa to gamma globulin and minimal albumin binding (10-30%) has been 
reported. 
After intravenous administration, CSF medicinal product exposure is nearly equivalent to that 
achieved in plasma; the mean ratio of AUC in CSF to plasma for thiotepa is 0.93. CSF and plasma 
concentrations of TEPA, the first reported active metabolite of thiotepa, exceed the concentrations of 
the parent compound. 
Biotransformation 
Thiotepa undergoes rapid and extensive hepatic metabolism and metabolites could be detected in 
urine within 1 hour after infusion. The metabolites are active alkylating agents but the role they play 
in the antitumor activity of thiotepa remains to be elucidated. Thiotepa undergoes oxidative 
desulphuration via the cytochrome P450 CYP2B and CYP3A isoenzyme families to the major and 
active metabolite TEPA (triethylenephosphoramide). The total excreted amount of thiotepa and its 
identified metabolites accounts for 54-100% of the total alkylating activity, indicating the presence of 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other alkylating metabolites. During conversion of GSH conjugates to N-acetylcysteine conjugates, 
GSH, cysteinylglycine, and cysteine conjugates are formed. These metabolites are not found in urine, 
and, if formed, are probably excreted in bile or as intermediate metabolites rapidly converted into 
thiotepa-mercapturate. 
Elimination 
The total clearance of thiotepa ranged from 11.4 to 23.2 l/h/m2. The elimination half-life varied from 
1.5 to 4.1 hours. The identified metabolites TEPA, monochlorotepa and thiotepa-mercapturate are all 
excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of thiotepa and TEPA is nearly complete after 6 and 8 hours 
respectively. The mean urinary recovery of thiotepa and its metabolites is 0.5% for the unchanged 
medicinal product and monochlorotepa, and 11% for TEPA and thiotepa-mercapturate. 
Linearity/non-linearity  
There is no clear evidence of saturation of metabolic clearance mechanisms at high doses of thiotepa.  
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of high dose thiotepa in children between 2 and 12 years of age do not appear 
to vary from those reported in children receiving 75 mg/m2 or adults receiving similar doses. 
Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on thiotepa elimination have not been assessed. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effects of hepatic impairment on thiotepa metabolism and elimination have not been assessed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No conventional acute and repeat dose toxicity studies were performed. 
Thiotepa was shown to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in mice and rats. 
Thiotepa was shown to impair fertility and interfere with spermatogenesis in male mice, and to impair 
ovarian function in female mice. It was teratogenic in mice and in rats, and foeto-lethal in rabbits. 
These effects were seen at doses lower than those used in humans.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Preparation of TEPADINA 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products must be considered. All 
transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution needs to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, the skin must 
be immediately and thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Reconstitution TEPADINA 15 mg 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. 
Remove the syringe and the needle and mix manually by repeated inversions. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used. Reconstituted solutions may 
occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be administered. 
Reconstitution of TEPADINA 100 mg 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. 
Remove the syringe and the needle and mix manually by repeated inversions. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used. Reconstituted solutions may 
occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be administered. 
Further dilution in the infusion bag 
The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be further diluted prior to administration with 
500 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (1 000 mL if the dose is higher than 
500 mg) or with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) in order to obtain a final 
TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. 
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded.  
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Haematological diseases 
The recommended dose in haematological diseases ranges from 125 mg/m2/day (5 mg/kg/day) to 
250 mg/m2/day (10 mg/kg/day) divided in one or two daily infusions, administered from 1 up to 
3 consecutive days before allogeneic HPCT depending on the combination with other 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chemotherapeutic medicinal products, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 
375 mg/m2 (15 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
LEUKAEMIA 
The recommended dose is 250 mg/m2/day (10 mg/kg/day) divided in two daily infusions, administered 
before allogeneic HPCT, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 250 mg/m2 
(10 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
THALASSEMIA 
The recommended dose ranges from 200 mg/m2/day (8 mg/kg/day) to 250 mg/m2/day (10 mg/kg/day) 
divided in two daily infusions, administered before allogeneic HPCT without exceeding the total 
maximum cumulative dose of 250 mg/m2 (10 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning 
treatment.  
REFRACTORY CYTOPENIA 
The recommended dose is 125 mg/m2/day (5 mg/kg/day) as a single daily infusion, administered for 
3 consecutive days before allogeneic HPCT, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 
375 mg/m2 (15 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
GENETIC DISEASES 
The recommended dose is 125 mg/m2/day (5 mg/kg/day) as a single daily infusion, administered for 
2 consecutive days before allogeneic HPCT, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 
250 mg/m2 (10 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
SICKLE CELL ANAEMIA 
The recommended dose is 250 mg/m2/day (10 mg/kg/day) divided in two daily infusions, administered 
before allogeneic HPCT, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 250 mg/m2 
(10 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Studies in renally impaired patients have not been conducted. As thiotepa and its metabolites are 
poorly excreted in the urine, dose modification is not recommended in patients with mild or moderate 
renal insufficiency. However, caution is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).   
Hepatic impairment 
Thiotepa has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since thiotepa is mainly 
metabolized through the liver, caution needs to be exercised when thiotepa is used in patients with pre-
existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. Dose 
modification is not recommended for transient alterations of hepatic parameters (see section 4.4). 
Elderly  
The administration of thiotepa has not been specifically investigated in elderly patients. However, in 
clinical studies, a proportion of patients over the age of 65 received the same cumulative dose as the 
other patients. No dose adjustment was deemed necessary. 
Method of administration 
TEPADINA is for intravenous use only. It must be administered by a qualified healthcare professional 
as a 2-4 hours intravenous infusion via a central venous catheter. 
The bag must only be removed from the aluminum wrapper immediately before the use. 
TEPADINA 200 mg 
If necessary, dose adjustment of TEPADINA must be operated as per specific application. 
In case the calculated dose required is higher than 200 mg but less than a multiple thereof, the user is 
requested to add the required mg from TEPADINA vials by using a dedicated port of TEPADINA 
200 mg.  
In case the calculated dose required is lower than 200 mg, the user is requested to remove the 
unnecessary mg of fully reconstituted 1 mg/mL solution or to set an infusion pump with the amount of 
medicinal product to be administered in mL. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEPADINA 400 mg 
If necessary, dose adjustment of TEPADINA must be operated as per specific application. 
In case the calculated dose required is higher than 400 mg but less than a multiple thereof, the user is 
requested to add the required mg from TEPADINA vials by using a dedicated port of TEPADINA 
400 mg.  
In case the calculated dose required is lower than 400 mg, the user is requested to remove the 
unnecessary mg of fully reconstituted 1 mg/mL solution or to set an infusion pump with the amount of 
medicinal product to be administered in mL. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Topical reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. Therefore, the use of 
gloves is recommended in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts 
the skin, the skin must be immediately thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa 
accidentally contacts mucous membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water (see section 
6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance. 
Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 
Concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and with live virus and bacterial vaccines (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The consequence of treatment with thiotepa at the recommended dose and schedule is profound 
myelosuppression, occurring in all patients. Severe granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia or 
any combination thereof may develop. Frequent complete blood counts, including differential white 
blood cell counts, and platelet counts need to be performed during the treatment and until recovery is 
achieved. Platelet and red blood cell support, as well as the use of growth factors such as Granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), should be employed as medically indicated. Daily white blood cell 
counts and platelet counts are recommended during therapy with thiotepa and after transplant for at 
least 30 days. 
Prophylactic or empiric use of anti-infectives (bacterial, fungal, viral) should be considered for the 
prevention and management of infections during the neutropenic period. 
Thiotepa has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since thiotepa is mainly 
metabolized through the liver, caution needs to be observed when thiotepa is used in patients with pre-
existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. When 
treating such patients it is recommended that serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 
are monitored regularly following transplant, for early detection of hepatotoxicity. 
Patients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of 
chemotherapy, or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk of hepatic veno-occlusive 
disease (see section 4.8). 
Caution must be used in patients with history of cardiac diseases, and cardiac function must be 
monitored regularly in patients receiving thiotepa.  
Caution must be used in patients with history of renal diseases and periodic monitoring of renal 
function should be considered during therapy with thiotepa.  
Thiotepa might induce pulmonary toxicity that may be additive to the effects produced by other 
cytotoxic agents (busulfan, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (see section 4.8). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Previous brain irradiation or craniospinal irradiation may contribute to severe toxic reactions (e.g. 
encephalopathy). 
The increased risk of a secondary malignancy with thiotepa, a known carcinogen in humans, must be 
explained to the patient. 
Concomitant use with live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever vaccines), phenytoin and 
fosphenytoin is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Thiotepa must not be concurrently administered with cyclophosphamide when both medicinal 
products are present in the same conditioning treatment. TEPADINA must be delivered after the 
completion of any cyclophosphamide infusion (see section 4.5). 
During the concomitant use of thiotepa and inhibitors of CYP2B6 or CYP3A4, patients should be 
carefully monitored clinically (see section 4.5). 
As most alkylating agents, thiotepa might impair male or female fertility. Male patients should seek 
for sperm cryopreservation before therapy is started and should not father a child while treated and 
during the year after cessation of treatment (see section 4.6). 
TEPADINA 400 mg contains 1 418 mg (61.6 mmol) sodium per bag, equivalent to 70.9% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
TEPADINA 200 mg contains 709 mg (30.8 mmol) sodium per bag, equivalent to 35.5% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Specific interactions with thiotepa  
Live virus and bacterial vaccines must not be administered to a patient receiving an 
immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and at least three months must elapse between 
discontinuation of therapy and vaccination.  
Thiotepa appears to be metabolised via CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Co-administration with inhibitors of 
CYP2B6 (for example clopidogrel and ticlopidine) or CYP3A4 (for example azole antifungals, 
macrolides like erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and protease inhibitors) may increase the 
plasma concentrations of thiotepa and potentially decrease the concentrations of the active metabolite 
TEPA. Co-administration of inducers of cytochrome P450 (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital) may increase the metabolism of thiotepa leading to increased plasma concentrations of 
the active metabolite. Therefore, during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products, 
patients should be carefully monitored clinically. 
Thiotepa is a weak inhibitor for CYP2B6, and may thereby potentially increase plasma concentrations 
of substances metabolised via CYP2B6, such as ifosfamide, tamoxifen, bupropion, efavirenz and 
cyclophosphamide. CYP2B6 catalyzes the metabolic conversion of cyclophosphamide to its active 
form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP) and co-administration of thiotepa may therefore lead to 
decreased concentrations of the active 4-OHCP. Therefore, a clinical monitoring should be exercised 
during the concomitant use of thiotepa and these medicinal products. 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalized vaccine-induced disease. 
More generally, live virus and bacterial vaccines must not be administered to a patient receiving an 
immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and at least three months must elapse between 
discontinuation of therapy and vaccination. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever): risk of systemic, possibly fatal disease. This risk is 
increased in subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. 
An inactivated virus vaccine should be used instead, whenever possible (poliomyelitis). 
Phenytoin: risk of exacerbation of convulsions resulting from the decrease of phenytoin digestive 
absorption by cytotoxic medicinal product or risk of toxicity enhancement and loss of efficacy of the 
cytotoxic medicinal product due to increased hepatic metabolism by phenytoin. 
Concomitant use to take into consideration 
Ciclosporine, tacrolimus: excessive immunosuppression with risk of lymphoproliferation. 
Alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including thiotepa, inhibit plasma pseudocholinesterase by 35% 
to 70%. The action of succinyl-choline can be prolonged by 5 to 15 minutes. 
Thiotepa must not be concurrently administered with cyclophosphamide when both medicinal 
products are present in the same conditioning treatment. TEPADINA must be delivered after the 
completion of any cyclophosphamide infusion. 
The concomitant use of thiotepa and other myelosuppressive or myelotoxic agents (i.e. 
cyclophosphamide, melphalan, busulfan, fludarabine, treosulfan) may potentiate the risk of 
haematologic adverse reactions due to overlapping toxicity profiles of these medicinal products. 
Interaction common to all cytotoxics 
Due to the increase of thrombotic risk in case of malignancy, the use of anticoagulative treatment is 
frequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation state during malignancy and the 
potential interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require, if it is decided 
to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants, to increase the frequency of the INR (International 
Normalised Ratio) monitoring. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and a pregnancy 
test should be performed before treatment is started. Male patients should not father a child while 
treated and during the year after cessation of treatment (see section 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of thiotepa during pregnancy. In pre-clinical studies thiotepa, as most 
alkylating agents, has been shown to cause embryofoetal lethality and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). 
Therefore, thiotepa is contraindicated during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether thiotepa is excreted in human milk. Due to its pharmacological properties and 
its potential toxicity for breast-fed newborns/infants, breast-feeding is contraindicated during 
treatment with thiotepa. 
Fertility 
As most alkylating agents, thiotepa might impair male and female fertility. 
Male patients should seek for sperm cryopreservation before therapy is started (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
TEPADINA has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It is likely that certain 
adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could affect these functions.

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of thiotepa has been examined through a review of adverse events reported in published 
data from clinical trials. In these studies, a total of 6 588 adult patients and 902 paediatric patients 
received thiotepa for conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.  
Serious toxicities involving the haematologic, hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as 
expected consequences of the conditioning regimen and transplant process. These include infection 
and Graft-versus host disease (GvHD) which, although not directly related, were the major causes of 
morbidity and mortality, especially in allogeneic HPCT. 
The most frequently adverse reactions reported in the different conditioning treatments including 
thiotepa are: infections, cytopenia, acute GvHD and chronic GvHD, gastrointestinal disorders, 
haemorrhagic cystitis and mucosal inflammation. 
Leukoencephalopathy  
Cases of leukoencephalopathy have been observed following treatment with thiotepa in adult and 
paediatric patients with multiple previous chemotherapies, including methotrexate and radiotherapy. 
Some cases had a fatal outcome.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdoses of thiotepa. The most important adverse reactions expected in 
case of overdose is myeloablation and pancytopenia.  
There is no known antidote for thiotepa. 
The haematological status needs to be closely monitored and vigorous supportive measures instituted 
as medically indicated. 
5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, ATC code: L01AC01 
Mechanism of action 
Thiotepa is a polyfunctional cytotoxic agent related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen 
mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethylene 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
imine radicals that, as in the case of irradiation therapy, disrupt the bonds of DNA, e.g. by alkylation 
of guanine at the N-7, breaking the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberating 
alkylated guanine. 
Clinical safety and efficacy 
The conditioning treatment must provide cytoreduction and ideally disease eradication. Thiotepa has 
marrow ablation as its dose-limiting toxicity, allowing significant dose escalation with the infusion of 
autologous HPCT. In allogeneic HPCT, the conditioning treatment must be sufficiently 
immunosuppressive and myeloablative to overcome host rejection of the graft. Due to its highly 
myeloablative characteristics, thiotepa enhances recipient immunosuppression and myeloablation, thus 
strengthening engraftment; this compensates for the loss of the GvHD-related GvL effects. As 
alkylating agent, thiotepa produces the most profound inhibition of tumour cell growth in vitro with 
the smallest increase in medicinal product concentration. Due to its lack of extramedullary toxicity 
despite dose escalation beyond myelotoxic doses, thiotepa has been used for decades in combination 
with other chemotherapy medicinal products prior to autologous and allogeneic HPCT.  
The results of published clinical studies supporting the efficacy of thiotepa are summarised: 
Autologous HPCT  
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment: Conditioning treatments including thiotepa have proved to be myeloablative. 
Disease free survival (DFS): An estimated 43% at five years has been reported, confirming that 
conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective therapeutic 
strategies for treating patients with haematological diseases. 
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being 60% or lower, which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy. In some of the conditioning treatments evaluated, relapse rates lower than 60% have also 
been reported at 5 years. 
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 29% to 87% with a follow-up ranging from 22 up to 
63 months. 
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
2.5% to 29% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 21% at 1 year, confirming the safety 
of the conditioning treatment including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in adult patients with 
haematological diseases. 
Solid tumours 
Engraftment: Conditioning treatments including thiotepa have proved to be myeloablative. 
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages reported with follow-up periods of more than 1 year confirm 
that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective choices for 
treating patients with solid tumours. 
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being lower than 60%, which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy. In some cases, relapse rates of 35% and of 45% have been reported at 5 years and 6 years 
respectively. 
Overall survival: OS ranged from 30% to 87% with a follow-up ranging from 11.7 up to 87 months. 
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 2% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 7.4% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatment including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in adult patients with solid tumours. 
Allogeneic HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment: Engraftment has been achieved (92%-100%) in all reported conditioning treatments and 
it was considered to occur at the expected time. Therefore, it can be concluded that conditioning 
treatments including thiotepa are myeloablative. 
GvHD (graft versus host disease): all conditioning treatments evaluated assured a low incidence of 
acute GvHD grade III-IV (from 4% to 24%). 
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages reported with follow-up periods of more than 1 year and up 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 5 years confirm that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following allogeneic HPCT are 
effective choices for treating patients with haematological diseases.  
Relapse: In all conditioning treatments containing thiotepa, relapse rates at more than 1 year have been 
reported as being lower than 40% (which was considered by the physicians as the threshold to prove 
efficacy). In some cases, relapse rates lower than 40% have also been reported at 5 years and 10 years. 
Overall survival: OS ranged from 31% to 81% with a follow-up ranging from 7.3 up to 120 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): low values have been 
reported, confirming the safety of the conditioning treatments including thiotepa for allogeneic HPCT 
in adult patients with haematological diseases. 
Paediatric population 
Autologous HPCT 
Solid tumours 
Engraftment: It has been achieved with all reported conditioning regimens including thiotepa.  
Disease free survival (DFS): With a follow-up of 36 to 57 months, DFS ranged from 46% to 70% in 
the reported studies. Considering that all patients were treated for high risk solid tumours, DFS results 
confirm that conditioning treatments containing thiotepa following autologous HPCT are effective 
therapeutic strategies for treating paediatric patients with solid tumours.  
Relapse: In all the reported conditioning regimens containing thiotepa, relapse rates at 12 to 57 months 
ranged from 33% to 57%. Considering that all patients suffer of recurrence or poor prognosis solid 
tumours, these rates support the efficacy of conditioning regimens based on thiotepa.  
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 17% to 84% with a follow-up ranging from 12.3 up to 
99.6 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 26.7% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 18% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatments including thiotepa for autologous HPCT in paediatric patients with solid 
tumours. 
Allogeneic HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
Engraftment: It has been achieved with all evaluated conditioning regimens including thiotepa with a 
success rate of 96% - 100%. The haematological recovery is in the expected time.  
Disease free survival (DFS): Percentages of 40% - 75% with follow-up of more than 1 year have been 
reported. DFS results confirm that conditioning treatment containing thiotepa following allogeneic 
HPCT are effective therapeutic strategies for treating paediatric patients with haematological diseases.  
Relapse: In all the reported conditioning regimens containing thiotepa, the relapse rate was in the 
range of 15%-44%. These data support the efficacy of conditioning regimens based on thiotepa in all 
haematological diseases. 
Overall survival (OS): OS ranged from 50% to 100% with a follow-up ranging from 9.4 up to 
121 months.  
Regimen related mortality (RRM) and Transplant related mortality (TRM): RRM values ranging from 
0% to 2.5% have been reported. TRM values ranged from 0% to 30% confirming the safety of the 
conditioning treatment including thiotepa for allogeneic HPCT in paediatric patients with 
haematological diseases. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Thiotepa is unreliably absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract: acid instability prevents thiotepa from 
being administered orally.  
Distribution 
Thiotepa is a highly lipophilic compound. After intravenous administration, plasma concentrations of 
the active substance fit a two compartment model with a rapid distribution phase. The volume of 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution of thiotepa is large and it has been reported as ranging from 40.8 l/m2 to 75 l/m2, 
indicating distribution to total body water. The apparent volume of distribution of thiotepa appears 
independent of the administered dose. The fraction unbound to proteins in plasma is 70-90%; 
insignificant binding of thiotepa to gamma globulin and minimal albumin binding (10-30%) has been 
reported. 
After intravenous administration, CSF medicinal product exposure is nearly equivalent to that 
achieved in plasma; the mean ratio of AUC in CSF to plasma for thiotepa is 0.93. CSF and plasma 
concentrations of TEPA, the first reported active metabolite of thiotepa, exceed the concentrations of 
the parent compound.   
Biotransformation 
Thiotepa undergoes rapid and extensive hepatic metabolism and metabolites could be detected in 
urine within 1 hour after infusion. The metabolites are active alkylating agents but the role they play 
in the antitumor activity of thiotepa remains to be elucidated. Thiotepa undergoes oxidative 
desulphuration via the cytochrome P450 CYP2B and CYP3A isoenzyme families to the major and 
active metabolite TEPA (triethylenephosphoramide). The total excreted amount of thiotepa and its 
identified metabolites accounts for 54-100% of the total alkylating activity, indicating the presence of 
other alkylating metabolites. During conversion of GSH conjugates to N-acetylcysteine conjugates, 
GSH, cysteinylglycine, and cysteine conjugates are formed. These metabolites are not found in urine, 
and, if formed, are probably excreted in bile or as intermediate metabolites rapidly converted into 
thiotepa-mercapturate. 
Elimination 
The total clearance of thiotepa ranged from 11.4 to 23.2 l/h/m2. The elimination half-life varied from 
1.5 to 4.1 hours. The identified metabolites TEPA, monochlorotepa and thiotepa-mercapturate are all 
excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of thiotepa and TEPA is nearly complete after 6 and 8 hours 
respectively. The mean urinary recovery of thiotepa and its metabolites is 0.5% for the unchanged 
medicinal product and monochlorotepa, and 11% for TEPA and thiotepa-mercapturate. 
Linearity/non-linearity  
There is no clear evidence of saturation of metabolic clearance mechanisms at high doses of thiotepa.  
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of high dose thiotepa in children between 2 and 12 years of age do not appear 
to vary from those reported in children receiving 75 mg/m2 or adults receiving similar doses. 
Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on thiotepa elimination have not been assessed. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effects of hepatic impairment on thiotepa metabolism and elimination have not been assessed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No conventional acute and repeat dose toxicity studies were performed. 
Thiotepa was shown to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in mice and rats. 
Thiotepa was shown to impair fertility and interfere with spermatogenesis in male mice, and to impair 
ovarian function in female mice. It was teratogenic in mice and in rats, and foeto-lethal in rabbits. 
These effects were seen at doses lower than those used in humans.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Preparation of TEPADINA 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products must be considered. All 
transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution needs to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, the skin must 
be immediately and thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Activation and reconstitution  
TEPADINA bag must be reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
The final reconstituted solution is obtained after breaking the peelable seal of the dual chamber bag 
and mixing the contents (powder and solvent) until complete dissolution of the powder.  
After reconstitution with the solvent, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of thiotepa. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used.  
Dose adjustments calculated according to posology (section 4.2) 
TEPADINA 200 mg  
In order to ensure the dose to be administered, an adjustment may be needed by withdrawal or addition 
of the solution, as follows:  
-  withdrawal (if the required dose is less than 200 mg) 
withdraw an appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (1 mg/mL), as needed, with a 
graduated syringe using the luer port (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet) or 
set an infusion pump with the amount of medicinal product to be administered in mL; 
- 
addition (if the required dose is greater than 200 mg) 
the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution from TEPADINA 15 mg or 100 mg vials 
(10 mg/mL) should be transferred into the infusion bag of TEPADINA 200 mg through the 
dedicated luer port (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet). 
TEPADINA 400 mg  
In order to ensure the dose to be administered, an adjustment may be needed by withdrawal or addition 
of the solution, as follows:  
-  withdrawal (if the required dose is less than 400 mg) 
withdraw an appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (1 mg/mL), as needed, with a 
graduated syringe using the luer port (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet) or 
set an infusion pump with the amount of medicinal product to be administered in mL; 
- 
addition (if the required dose is greater than 400 mg) 
the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution from TEPADINA 15 mg or 100 mg vials 
(10 mg/mL) should be transferred into the infusion bag of TEPADINA 400 mg through the 
dedicated luer port (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet). 
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded.  
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

TEPADINA 15 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

- 
this leaflet. See section 4. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in

5.  How to store TEPADINA 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TEPADINA is and what it is used for 
TEPADINA contains the active substance thiotepa, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
alkylating agents. 
TEPADINA is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying bone 
marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic progenitor 
cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
TEPADINA can be used in adults and children and adolescents. 
2.  What you need to know before you use TEPADINA 
Do not use TEPADINA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to thiotepa, 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, 
if you are breast-feeding, 
if you are receiving yellow fever vaccination, live virus and bacterial vaccines. 
Warning and precautions 
You should tell your doctor if you have: 
- 
- 
- 
liver or kidney problems, 
heart or lung problems, 
seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). 
Because TEPADINA destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular blood 
tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. 
In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. 
TEPADINA may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk with 
you.

Other medicines and TEPADINA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you think you may be pregnant before you receive 
TEPADINA. You must not use TEPADINA during pregnancy. 
Both women and men using TEPADINA must use effective contraceptive methods during treatment. 
Men should not father a child while treated with TEPADINA and during the year after cessation of 
treatment. 
It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, 
women must not breast-feed during treatment with TEPADINA. 
TEPADINA can impair male and female fertility. Male patients should seek advice for sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. 
Driving and using machines 
It is likely that certain adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body surface or weight and your disease. 
How TEPADINA is given 
TEPADINA is administered by a qualified healthcare professional as an intravenous infusion (drip in a 
vein) after dilution of the individual vial. Each infusion will last 2-4 hours. 
Frequency of administration 
You will receive your infusions every 12 or 24 hours. The duration of treatment can last up to 5 days. 
Frequency of administration and duration of treatment depend on your disease. 
4.  Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, TEPADINA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

2.  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
General 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. 
All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution need to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, immediately 
the skin must be thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Calculation of dose of TEPADINA 
TEPADINA is administered at different doses in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products in patients prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) for 
haematological diseases or solid tumours.  
TEPADINA  posology  is  reported,  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients,  according  to  the  type  of  HPCT 
(autologous or allogeneic) and disease. 
Posology in adults 
AUTOLOGOUS HPCT 
Haematological diseases 
The recommended dose in haematological diseases ranges from 125 mg/m2/day (3.38 mg/kg/day) to  
300 mg/m2/day (8.10 mg/kg/day) as a single daily infusion, administered from 2 up to 4 consecutive 
days before autologous HPCT depending on the combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 900 mg/m2 (24.32 mg/kg), during 
the time of the entire conditioning treatment.  
LYMPHOMA 
The recommended dose ranges from 125 mg/m2/day (3.38 mg/kg/day) to 300 mg/m2/day  
(8.10 mg/kg/day) as a single daily infusion, administered from 2 up to 4 consecutive days before 
autologous HPCT depending on the combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal products, 
without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose of 900 mg/m2 (24.32 mg/kg), during the time 
of the entire conditioning treatment.  
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) LYMPHOMA 
The recommended dose is 185 mg/m2/day (5 mg/kg/day) as a single daily infusion, administered for 
2 consecutive days before autologous HPCT, without exceeding the total maximum cumulative dose 
of 370 mg/m2 (10 mg/kg), during the time of the entire conditioning treatment.

Reconstitution 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. 
Remove the syringe and the needle and mix manually by repeated inversions. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used. Reconstituted solutions may 
occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be administered. 
Further dilution in the infusion bag 
The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be further diluted prior to administration with 
500 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (1 000 mL if the dose is higher than 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
500 mg) or with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) in order to obtain a final 
TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL.  
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
TEPADINA should be aseptically administered as a 2-4 hours infusion under room temperature (about 
25°C) and normal light conditions. 
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements

this leaflet. See section 4. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in 
What is in this leaflet:  
1.  What TEPADINA is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before you use TEPADINA 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store TEPADINA 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TEPADINA  is and what it is used for 
TEPADINA contains the active substance thiotepa, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
alkylating agents. 
TEPADINA is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying bone 
marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic progenitor 
cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
TEPADINA can be used in adults and children and adolescents. 
2.  What you need to know before you use  TEPADINA 
Do not use TEPADINA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to thiotepa, 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant,  
if you are breast-feeding, 
if you are receiving yellow fever vaccination, live virus and bacterial vaccines. 
Warning and precautions  
You should tell your doctor if you have: 
- 
- 
-  
liver or kidney problems, 
heart or lung problems, 
seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). 
Because TEPADINA destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular blood 
tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. 
In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. 
TEPADINA may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk with 
you.

Other medicines and TEPADINA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you think you may be pregnant before you receive 
TEPADINA. You must not use TEPADINA during pregnancy. 
Both women and men using TEPADINA must use effective contraceptive methods during treatment. 
Men should not father a child while treated with TEPADINA and during the year after cessation of 
treatment. 
It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, 
women must not breast-feed during treatment with TEPADINA. 
TEPADINA can impair male and female fertility. Male patients should seek advice for sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. 
Driving and using machines 
It is likely that certain adverse events of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body surface or weight and your disease. 
How TEPADINA is given 
TEPADINA is administered by a qualified healthcare professional as an intravenous infusion (drip in a 
vein) after dilution of the individual vial. Each infusion will last 2-4 hours. 
Frequency of administration 
You will receive your infusions every 12 or 24 hours. The duration of treatment can last up to 5 days. 
Frequency of administration and duration of treatment depend on your disease. 
4.  Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, TEPADINA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effects of TEPADINA therapy or the transplant procedure may include 
-       decrease in circulating blood cell counts (intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for your 
         transplant infusion) 
-       infection 
-       liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein 
-       the graft attacks your body (graft versus host disease)

2.  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
General 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. 
All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution need to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, immediately 
the skin must be thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Calculation of dose of TEPADINA 
TEPADINA is administered at different doses in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products in patients prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) for 
haematological diseases or solid tumours.  
TEPADINA  posology  is  reported,  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients,  according  to  the  type  of  HPCT 
(autologous or allogeneic) and disease.

Reconstitution 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 mL of sterile water for injections. 
Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper. 
Remove the syringe and the needle and mix manually by repeated inversions. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used. Reconstituted solutions may 
occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be administered. 
Further dilution in the infusion bag 
The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be further diluted prior to administration with 
500 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (1 000 mL if the dose is higher than 
500 mg) or with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) in order to obtain a final 
TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL.  
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
TEPADINA should be aseptically administered as a 2-4 hours infusion under room temperature (about 
25°C) and normal light conditions. 
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

2.  What you need to know before you use TEPADINA 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store TEPADINA 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TEPADINA is and what it is used for 
TEPADINA  contains  the  active  substance  thiotepa,  which  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines  called 
alkylating agents. 
TEPADINA is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying bone 
marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic progenitor 
cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
TEPADINA can be used in adults and children and adolescents. 
2.  What you need to know before you use TEPADINA 
Do not use TEPADINA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to thiotepa, 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, 
if you are breast-feeding, 
if you are receiving yellow fever vaccination, live virus and bacterial vaccines. 
Warning and precautions 
You should tell your doctor if you have: 
- 
- 
- 
liver or kidney problems, 
heart or lung problems, 
seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). 
Because TEPADINA destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular blood 
tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. 
In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. 
TEPADINA may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk with you.

Other medicines and TEPADINA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you think you may be pregnant before you receive 
TEPADINA. You must not use TEPADINA during pregnancy. 
Both women and men using TEPADINA must use effective contraceptive methods during treatment. 
Men should not father a child while treated with TEPADINA and during the year after cessation of 
treatment. 
It is not known whether this medicine is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, women 
must not breast-feed during treatment with TEPADINA. 
TEPADINA  can  impair  male  and  female  fertility.  Male  patients  should  seek  advice  for  sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. 
Driving and using machines 
It is likely that certain adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. 
TEPADINA contains sodium  
This medicine contains  709 mg (30.8 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
bag. This is equivalent to  35, 5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body surface or weight and your disease. 
How TEPADINA is given 
TEPADINA is administered by a qualified healthcare professional as an intravenous infusion (drip in a 
vein) after reconstitution of the individual bag. Each infusion will last 2-4 hours.  
Frequency of administration 
You will receive your infusions every 12 or 24 hours. The duration of treatment can last up to 5 days. 
Frequency of administration and duration of treatment depend on your disease. 
4.  Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effects of TEPADINA therapy or the transplant procedure may include 
- 
decrease in circulating blood cell counts (intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for your 
 transplant infusion) 
infection 
liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein

PREPARATION GUIDE 
TEPADINA 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion 
Thiotepa 
Read this guide prior to the preparation and administration of TEPADINA.  
1.  PRESENTATION 
One bag contains 200 mg thiotepa. 
After reconstitution with the solvent, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of thiotepa. 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted prior to administration. 
2.  POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION  
Calculation of dose of TEPADINA 
TEPADINA is administered at different doses in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products in patients prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) for 
haematological diseases or solid tumours.  
TEPADINA posology is reported, in adult and paediatric patients, according to the type of HPCT 
(autologous or allogeneic) and disease.  
If necessary, dose adjustment of TEPADINA must be operated as per specific application. 
In case the calculated dose required is higher than 200 mg but less than a multiple thereof, the user is 
requested to add the required mg from TEPADINA vials by using a dedicated port (luer port) of 
TEPADINA 200 mg (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet).  
In case the calculated dose required is lower than 200 mg the user is requested to remove the 
unnecessary mg of fully reconstituted 1 mg/mL solution or to set an infusion pump with the amount of 
medicinal product to be administered in mL. 
Posology in adults

Activation of the bag and reconstitution  
TEPADINA200 mg must be reconstituted with 200 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection. The final reconstituted solution is obtained after breaking the peelable seal of the dual 
chamber bag and mixing the contents (powder and solvent) until complete dissolution of the powder. 
After reconstitution with the solvent, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of thiotepa. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice any visible signs of deterioration.  
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded.  
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
TEPADINA should be aseptically administered as a 2-4 hours infusion under room temperature (about 
25°C) and normal light conditions. 
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
3.  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
General 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. 
All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution need to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, immediately 
the skin must be thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TEPADINA is and what it is used for 
TEPADINA  contains  the  active  substance  thiotepa,  which  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines  called 
alkylating agents. 
TEPADINA is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying bone 
marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic progenitor 
cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
TEPADINA can be used in adults and children and adolescents. 
2.  What you need to know before you use TEPADINA 
Do not use TEPADINA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to thiotepa, 
if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, 
if you are breast-feeding, 
if you are receiving yellow fever vaccination, live virus and bacterial vaccines. 
Warning and precautions 
You should tell your doctor if you have: 
- 
- 
- 
liver or kidney problems, 
heart or lung problems, 
seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). 
Because TEPADINA destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular blood 
tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. 
In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. 
TEPADINA may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk with you.

Other medicines and TEPADINA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you think you may be pregnant before you receive 
TEPADINA. You must not use TEPADINA during pregnancy. 
Both women and men using TEPADINA must use effective contraceptive methods during treatment. 
Men should not father a child while treated with TEPADINA  and during the year after cessation of 
treatment. 
It is not known whether this medicine is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, women 
must not breast-feed during treatment with TEPADINA. 
TEPADINA  can  impair  male  and  female  fertility.  Male  patients  should  seek  advice  for  sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. 
Driving and using machines 
It is likely that certain adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. 
TEPADINA contains sodium  
This medicine contains 1 418 mg (61.6 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
bag. This is equivalent to 70.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. 
3.  How to use TEPADINA 
Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body surface or weight and your disease. 
How TEPADINA is given 
TEPADINA is administered by a qualified healthcare professional as an intravenous infusion (drip in a 
vein) after reconstitution of the individual bag. Each infusion will last 2-4 hours.  
Frequency of administration 
You will receive your infusions every 12 or 24 hours. The duration of treatment can last up to 5 days. 
Frequency of administration and duration of treatment depend on your disease. 
4.  Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effects of TEPADINA therapy or the transplant procedure may include 
- 
decrease in circulating blood cell counts (intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for your 
 transplant infusion) 
infection 
liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein

PREPARATION GUIDE 
TEPADINA 400 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion 
Thiotepa 
Read this guide prior to the preparation and administration of TEPADINA.  
1.  PRESENTATION 
One bag contains 400 mg thiotepa. 
After reconstitution with the solvent, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of thiotepa. 
TEPADINA must be reconstituted prior to administration. 
2.  POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION  
Calculation of dose of TEPADINA 
TEPADINA is administered at different doses in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products in patients prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) for 
haematological diseases or solid tumours.  
TEPADINA posology is reported, in adult and paediatric patients, according to the type of HPCT 
(autologous or allogeneic) and disease.  
If necessary, dose adjustment of TEPADINA must be operated as per specific application. 
In case the calculated dose required is higher than 400 mg but less than a multiple thereof, the user is 
requested to add the required mg from TEPADINA vials by using a dedicated port (luer port) of 
TEPADINA 400 mg (Step 5 of the Instruction for Use in the package leaflet).  
In case the calculated dose required is lower than 400 mg the user is requested to remove the 
unnecessary mg of fully reconstituted 1 mg/mL solution or to set an infusion pump with the amount of 
medicinal product to be administered in mL.

Activation of the bag and reconstitution  
TEPADINA 400 mg must be reconstituted with 400 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection. The final reconstituted solution is obtained after breaking the peelable seal of the dual 
chamber bag and mixing the contents (powder and solvent) until complete dissolution of the powder. 
After reconstitution with the solvent, each mL of solution contains 1 mg of thiotepa. 
Only colourless solutions, without any particulate matter, must be used.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice any visible signs of deterioration.  
Administration  
TEPADINA infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to 
administration. Solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded.  
The infusion solution must be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 µm 
in-line filter. Filtering does not alter solution potency. 
TEPADINA should be aseptically administered as a 2-4 hours infusion under room temperature (about 
25°C) and normal light conditions. 
Prior to and following each infusion, the indwelling catheter line should be flushed with 
approximately 5 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
3.  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL AND OTHER HANDLING 
General 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. 
All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. 
As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution need to be exercised in handling and preparation of 
TEPADINA solutions to avoid accidental contact with skin or mucous membranes. Topical reactions 
associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may occur. In fact, the use of gloves is recommended 
in preparing the solution for infusion. If thiotepa solution accidentally contacts the skin, immediately 
the skin must be thoroughly washed with soap and water. If thiotepa accidentally contacts mucous 
membranes, they must be flushed thoroughly with water. 
Disposal 
TEPADINA is for single use only.  
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody blocking the interaction 
between the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PDL2. As a consequence, 
the functional activity of the target lymphocytes is enhanced to facilitate immune-mediated anti-tumor 
activity. A Marketing Authorization was granted on July 17, 2015 in the EU as monotherapy for the 
treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.  
Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million 
new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer 
cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma 
skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to 
females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related 
deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union 
(Malvezzi et al 2013). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further 
subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other 
cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al 
NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011). 
In approximately two thirds of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage. The standard of 
care for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC is still platinum-based doublets, to which bevacizumab 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

and/or maintenance therapy in patients with good performance status can be added. In case of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
rearrangements, approved target therapy agents are available.  
The prognosis for patients who failed first line therapies is dismal. A poor response rate was reported 
from single agent docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib (4.0% - 17.9%), with the median progression 
free survival (PFS) of 1.5 to 4.2 months and the overall survival (OS) ranging from 5.4 to 14.8 
months. A small but statistically significant improvement over docetaxel single agent was registered 
with the addition of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically binding VEGF Receptor 2, that 
has been recently approved in combination with docetaxel as a second-line therapy for advanced 
NSCLC patients. The combination of docetaxel plus ramucirumab showed a small but statistically 
significant improvement in terms of PFS (HR 0.76, median PFS 4.5 vs. 3.0 months) and OS (HR 0.86, 
median OS 10.5 vs. 9.1 months).  
Nintedanib, a multi kinase inhibitor, in combination with docetaxel has been also approved for the 
second-line treatment of NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma, based on the demonstration of a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS and OS compared to docetaxel single agent (PFS: HR 0.84, 
median PFS 4.2 vs. 2.8 months in the follow-up analysis of the primary endpoint, OS: HR 0.83, median 
12.6 vs. 10.3 months). 
Nivolumab, a different antibody directed against PD-1, is already approved for the treatment of locally 
advanced or metastatic squamous and non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. 
The current application is a type II variation to extend the indication in treatment of advanced Non-
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults with tumours expressing PD-L1 who have received at 
least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The application is based on results from the  study KEYNOTE-
010 “A Phase II/III Randomized Trial of Two Doses of MK-3475 versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated 
Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer”, with supportive data from the phase I trial KEYNOTE-001, 
cohorts C and F. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults 
whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. 
Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should also have disease progression on 
approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. 
The CHMP recommended the following indication: 
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have received at least one prior 
chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have 
received approved therapy for these mutations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. 
In order to be treated with Keytruda, patients with NSCLC should be selected for treatment based on 
the tumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission 
of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant 
risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The updated clinical pharmacology results supporting this submission include: 
• pharmacokinetic data from P010; 
• updated exposure-response analysis for efficacy (tumor size, pooling data from P010 together with 
P001 in NSCLC) 
• an updated program-wide evaluation of exposure-response for immune-related adverse events based 
on available data in NSCLC and melanoma patients (P001, P002, P006, and P010) 
• An updated program-wide evaluation of immunogenicity. 
The submitted analyses incorporating new data from the study P010 are shown in the following table.

Absorption 
Keytruda is administered via the i.v. route and is therefore completely (100%) bioavailable.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of Keytruda at steady state is small (7.4L). 
Elimination 
Keytruda  is  eliminated  by  catabolism.  The  systemic  clearance  of  Keytruda  is  ~0.2  L/day  (CV:  37%) 
and the terminal half-life (t½) is ~27 days (CV: 38%). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Exposure to Keytruda (Cmax and AUC) increased linearly dose proportionally within the dose range for 
efficacy (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg). 
Upon repeated dosing, the clearance of Keytruda was found to be independent of time, and systemic 
accumulation was approximately 2.1-fold when administered every 3 weeks. 
Special populations 
The  impact  of  intrinsic  factors  on  pembrolizumab  exposure  from  the  definitive  population  PK  analysis 
(report 0473LK) is described below (see also section 2.3.4 for a detailed description of population PK 
report 0473LK). 
Exploratory analysis of covariates 
Based on established exposure bounds, no clinically relevant impact on exposure was identified for 
other intrinsic factors in the NSCLC population, including age, gender, race, renal impairment (eGFR), 
or mild hepatic impairment and markers of FcRn capacity (baseline albumin). Exploratory covariate 
evaluations were performed as exemplified for age (see figure below). 
Figure 1: Effect of Age on pembrolizumab clearance (final data set) 
The following shows plot of ETA on Clearance as well as Clearance versus gender.

The following figure illustrates the small difference in clearance between patients with different ECOG 
status. 
Figure 5: Effect of ECOG on clearance 
Tumour  burden  showed  a  trend  of  correlation  with  clearance  as  well  as  inter-individual  variability  on 
clearance suggesting that Tumour burden might have an effect on clearance (figure below). 
Figure 6: Effect of tumour burden on clearance 
There appears to be no obvious trend between clearance and eGFR, either as a continuous covariate or 
as a categorical covariate broken out by impairment severity classification. 
No effect on clearance is seen for mild and normal hepatic patients (Figure below, right). However for 
severe and moderate hepatic patients there appears to be an indication of a trend towards decreased 
clearance. Limited number of patients in Severe and Moderate hepatic categories were available in the 
pop PK analysis (table below).

Statistical covariate analysis  
Method 
As  an  exploratory  check  intended  to  test  stability  of  the  key  covariate  findings,  re-identification  of 
covariates  was  performed  using  a  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Stepwise  Covariate  Model  building, 
SCM)  within  PsN  (psn.sourceforge.net).  This  procedure  involves  stepwise  testing  of  linear  and  non-
linear relationships in a forwards inclusion (ΔOFV of 6.63, p < 0.01 for 1 DF) and backwards exclusion 
(Δ OFV of 10.8, p < 0.001 for 1 DF) procedure. The categorical covariates Gender (on CL and Vc) and 
ECOG  performance  status,  Co-administered  drugs,  Cancer  type,  Race,  PDL1,  Smoking  Status  on  CL 
were tested as well as the continuous covariates Albumin and AST (on CL and Vc) and Bilirubin, eGFR, 
Tumour burden and Age on CL. Weight was included as structural covariate on clearance and volume.  
The covariate ‘prior IPI treatment status’ was excluded from the present analysis, as it was specifically 
collected  only  in  the  melanoma  trials.  In  addition,  to  all  previous  covariates,  Race  (White/Asian)  was 
added due to the number of Asian subjects that were recruited in P010. 
As in the previous analysis, highly correlated (ALP, ALT) and covariates with missing values (IgG) were 
excluded. 
Results 
The  following  table  provides  the  final  list  of  statistically  significant  covariates  selected  by  the  SCM 
algorithm. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 13/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4: Results from covariate analysis  
Since  no  new  covariates  were  selected  compared  to  the  previous  population  PK  analysis,  no 
assessment of clinical relevance of the covariate effects was performed. Specifically, the newly added 
covariate  race  was  not  picked  up  as  having  statistically-significant  impact  on  clearance  or  volume  of 
distribution and was therefore not assessed for clinical relevance.  
The final model was fitted to 1000 bootstrap replicate datasets to assess consistency of the parameter 
estimates  and  their  precision  with  those  obtained  in  the  previous  population  PK  analysis.  The  mean 
parameter  estimates  and  associated  95%  CIs  were  along  with  the  bootstrap  estimates  from  the 
previous  population  PK  analysis.  Results  indicate  robust  consistency  between  the  two  analyses,  with 
confidence intervals for most of the parameter estimates showing large overlap. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed in vitro and in vivo.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials have been performed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Keytruda  is  an  antibody  which  binds  to  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  blocks  its 
interaction  with  ligands  PD-L1  and  PD-L2.  The  PD-1  receptor  is  a  negative  regulator of  T-cell  activity 
that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Keytruda potentiates T-
cell  responses,  including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-
L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in 
the tumour microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
An  integrated  immunogenicity  evaluation  has  been  performed  across  data  from  studies  P001,  P002, 
P006 and P010. The studies included in the analysis are summarized in the following table. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 14/116 
 
 
 
 
 
Table  5:  Analysis  datasets,  included  study  parts,  indication  and  data  cut-off  dates  –  Immunogenicity 
evaluation 
In the new database, a total of 11886 samples from 2910 subjects were available.  
The  immunogenicity  categorization  was  to  include  only  subjects  who  received  treatment  and  had  a 
post-treatment  ADA  sample  available.  The  overall  immunogenicity  incidence  was  defined  as  the 
proportion of treatment-emergent positive subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects. 
Figure 8: Flow charts of subjects included in immunogenicity analysis 
The immunogenicity analysis as presented contained 2632 subjects (1535 melanoma and 1097 NSCLC 
assessable subjects).  
Twenty  nine  (29)  subjects  had  one  or  more  samples  that  tested  positive  in  the  tier  2  confirmatory 
assay  for  antibodies  against  pembrolizumab.  In  the  subgroup  of  NSCLC  subjects,  16  of  the  653 
evaluable  subjects  tested  positive  for  treatment-emergent  antibodies  to  pembrolizumab  during 
treatment  with  pembrolizumab  (16  with  treatment  emergent  positive  status,  6  with  non-treatment 
emergent  positive  status  and  631  with  negative  immunogenicity  status,  red  rectangles),  yielding  an 
incidence rate of 2.5% and compared to 631 negative and 444 inconclusive subjects. 
An overview of the immunogenicity evaluation stratified by treatment and indication is presented in the 
table reported below. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 15/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 6: Summary of subject immunogenicity results (pooled analysis of P001, P002, P006, and P010) 
As  reported  in  the  table  above,  the  observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable 
subjects  was  1.7%  (19  out  of  1087,  green  rectangles).  Of  note,  the  previously  reported  value  in  the 
melanoma indication was 0.4 %. 
At  this  time,  results  from  the  neutralizing  assay  are  available  from  4  subjects.  For  one  of  these 
subjects  that  was  negative  at  ADA  assay,  sample  was  inadvertently  tested  in  Neutralizing  Assay  and 
resulted to be positive. The remaining three subjects were negative in the neutralizing assay. 
Evaluation of drug tolerance level 
Interference  by  pembrolizumab  in  the  ADA  assays  may  occur,  especially  at  concentrations  above  the 
drug  tolerance  level.  Therefore,  samples  with  a  negative  test  result  in  the  screening  or  confirmatory 
anti-pembrolizumab  assay  could  only  be  conclusively  confirmed  to  be  negative  in  the  case  of  a 
pembrolizumab  concentration  below  the  DTL.  Furthermore,  the  immunogenicity  status  of  a  subject 
could  only  be  conclusively  confirmed  to  be  negative  if  all  pre-treatment  and  post-dose  samples  were 
negative  in  the  confirmatory  assay  for  antibodies  against  pembrolizumab  and  if  the  concentration  of 
pembrolizumab in the last post-dose sample was below the drug tolerance level.

At  the  recommended  dosing  regimen  of  2  mg/kg,  the  pembrolizumab  concentration  in  the  last  post-
dose sample was below the drug tolerance level for about 81% of the subjects.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
An  extension  of  the  population  PK  analysis  (044WBG  using  P001,  P002  and  P006  studies  and 
submitted  as  part  of  EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002,  CHMP  opinion  adopted  on  1  April  2016)  was 
conducted.  The  present  analysis  (report  0473LK)  also  includes  data  from  657  NSCLC  patients  from 
protocol P010. In total 2856 subjects were included in the final analysis with the objectives to: 
• Assess the appropriateness of the existing Pop PK model to characterize concentration data from 
Protocol 010. 
• Generate exposure predictions for patients in Protocol 010 to support exposure-response analyses. 
• Investigate the effects of race on pertinent PK parameters 
The parameters from the initial and updated models are compared in the following table.

Exploratory Re-check of Covariate Findings 
To confirm consistency in covariate relationships between the model based on the updated dataset and 
the  previous  analysis,  an  exploratory  covariate  analysis  was  conducted.  In  addition  to  all  previous 
covariates, RACE (White/Asian) was added due to the number of Asian subjects recruited in P010 (see 
table below).

Simulations to Illustrate the PK Profile of Pembrolizumab 
The  model  was  used  to  simulate  typical  concentration-time  profiles  for  different  dosing  regimens  of 
pembrolizumab. This included a comparison of the exposures that would be generated by a fixed dose 
regimen of 200 mg Q3W with those for the weight-based doses included in the current dataset.  
The  table  below  presents  values  of  derived  parameters  (Cmax,  Ctrough,  AUC)  at  steady  state  obtained 
from model-based simulations. Typical patient receiving dosing regiments of 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg 
Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W were simulated 1000 times using the final model.

Exposure-response analysis  
A  Model-based  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  pembrolizumab  exposure  and  efficacy  in  patients 
with NSCLC in PN001 and PN010 was performed (report 0473KZ) 
Data for this analysis were derived from patients treated on cohorts C and F of Protocol 001 (PN001) 
and  pembrolizumab-treated  arms  of  Protocol  010  (PN010).  In  total,  550  subjects  received 
pembrolizumab treatment on PN001 and 682 on PN010. The tumour size exposure-response modelling 
analysis  dataset  consists of  a  subset  of  these  ‘all patients  as treated’  (APaT)  set  including  only  those 
patients who had a baseline tumour size assessment and were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Results:  
There  were  4,554  observations  from  1,151  patients  comprising  the  FAS  dataset  used  in  the  tumour 
size  exposure-response  analysis  described  in  this  report.  Of  these  1,151  patients,  84  had  a  tumour 
size measurement at a follow-up of at least 28 weeks but no measurements within a 26-30 week (i.e. 
28  ±  2  week)  window.  697  patients  in  the  dataset had  maximum  follow-up  less  than  28  ±  2  weeks. 
This left 370 patients who had at least one tumour size measurement within 26-30 week (i.e. 28 ± 2 
week)  from  baseline  and  also  an  AUCss-6weeks  value.  Of  these  370  patients,  173  were  considered  TPS 
≥50%, 156 were TPS 1-49%, 25 were TPS<1% (PD-L1 negative), and 16 were PD-L1 unknown. 
Exploratory  plots  were  generated  to  gain  insight in the  overall  pattern  of  change  in  tumour  size over 
time  and  to  investigate  trends  of  response  to  treatment  vs.  exposure.  The  visual  exploration  was 
supported by the results of a simple linear regression where appropriate.

Exposure-response Simulations 
Per  RECIST  1.1  criteria,  a  maximum  of  five  representative  target  lesions  (and  up  to  two  lesions  per 
organ) are identified and monitored for follow-up. Target lesions are evaluated based on change in SLD 
and patient response classified as either Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions), 
Partial Response (PR; 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions), Progressive Disease (PD; 20% increase 
in  SLD  of  target  lesions),  and  Stable  Disease  (SD;  neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to  qualify  for  PR  nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD). 
Simulations were first conducted at 1 mg/kg Q3W, 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W and 200 mg Q3W, 
drawing from subjects with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, and from subjects with TPS≥1% (data not shown).

Exposure-Adverse Event analysis 
An  exposure-adverse  event  analysis  of  pembrolizumab  in  a  pooled  dataset of  patients  with  advanced 
melanoma  and  NSCLC  form  P001,  P002,  P006  and  P0101  studies  was  performed  (report  0473LR)  to 
further characterize the exposure response relationship for pembrolizumab for relevant adverse events

in  a  pooled  dataset  across  melanoma  and  NSCLC  indications  and  to  estimate  the  impact  of  other 
predictors on the occurrence of the adverse events of interest. 
Data  from  2530  patients,  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  pembrolizumab  and  had  a  measured 
baseline  tumour  value,  was  used  for  this  exposure  safety  analysis.  Consistent  with  overall  safety 
analyses  presented  elsewhere,  a  group  of  AEs  of  special  interest  (AEOSI)  was  defined,  as  a  broad 
category  of  potentially  immune  related  adverse  events,  excluding  mild  dermatological  disorders.  The 
AEOSI group was used as the dependent variable in this analysis. 
Simulation 
Simulations  were  used  to  characterize  the  typical  probability  of  experiencing  an  AEOSI  event  as  a 
function  of  exposure  taking  into  account  the  estimated  parameter  uncertainty  from  the  variance-
covariance matrix and the influence of any significant covariate from the final model. Simulations were 
performed on the basis of the final model. 
Covariates 
The following baseline covariates were included in the analysis datasets: duration of treatment, dosing 
regimen,  randomization  status,  indication,  baseline  tumor  size,  ECOG  performance  status,  body 
weight,  sex,  EGFR  status  and  PD-L1  status.  A  specific  component  of  the  covariate  analysis  was  to 
assess the importance of time (duration of treatment) for the occurrence of AEOSI. 
Exploratory analysis 
The potential presence of an exposure response relationship was investigated by means of bar plots of 
AE frequency vs bins of AUC6wks for different covariates (the same covariates as mentioned above). 
The AUC values were divided into bins based on the percentiles and the number of bins depended on 
the total number of patients in order to have sufficient patients per bin or percentile. 
Results 
The  results  of  the  stepwise  covariate  analysis  (first  forward  addition,  data  not  shown)  revealed  the 
duration of treatment as the main covariate that was statistically significant on intercept indicating that 
patients  with  longer  treatment  duration  have  somewhat  higher  probability  to  experience  an  AEOSI. 
Following inclusion of this covariate, no other covariate relationships were found to meet the criterion 
for inclusion in the model. 
The table reported below summarizes the estimated parameters from the final model.  
The  inclusion  of  the  covariate  for  treatment  duration  rendered  the  linear  exposure  response 
relationship insignificant (p=0.56 based on log likelihood ratio test versus a model with the slope value 
fixed  at  zero),  as  also  indicated  by  the  large  %  relative  standard  error  (RSE)  for  the  parameter 
estimate. 
Table 14: Parameter estimates of the final AEOSI logistic regression model 
Apart from the exposure-response slope, the other two parameters (intercept and effect of treatment 
duration on intercept) were estimated with good precision (low %RSE).

When  forcing the non-significant regression slope with AUC on the final model, this was estimated to 
be  0.00000581  mL/(μg.day)  (173%  RSE).  This  translates  into  predicted  probabilities  of  having  a 
potentially  immune  related  AE  ranging  from  18.6  to  19.7%  for  the  10th  and  90th  percentiles  of 
AUC6wks values, respectively, in the pooled analysis dataset. 
Model Qualification 
Before using the logistic regression model for simulation purposes a visual predictive check (VPC) for 
the  final  model  based  on  the  full  dataset.  Data  sets  were  simulated  based  on  the  estimates  of  the 
parameters  and  the  accompanied  uncertainties  from  the  final  model.  The  VPC  was  performed  by 
simulating  10000  subjects.  The  5th,  50th  and  95th-percentiles  were  calculated  from  the  simulated 
profiles and were super-imposed on the raw data (divided into different bins: one for 2 mg/kg and 4 
equally  sized  bins  for  10  mg/kg,  each  for  three  different  categories  of  treatment  duration)  to  allow 
assessment of model predictability. The VPC for the final model including a non-significant exposure to 
pembrolizumab and incidence of AEOSI is displayed below.

exposure-response relationship for the incidence of AEOSI 
SIMULATIONS 
Data Sets 
The  simulation  datasets  included  10000  subjects  and  exposure  as  the  predictor  variable.  In  addition, 
treatment duration was included, since it was a significant covariate in the model.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
An updated clinical pharmacology dossier was submitted as part of this application. 
Immunogenicity evaluation  
An integrated immunogenicity evaluation has been performed across data from studies P001, P002, 
P006 and P010. The immunogenicity analysis as presented in this report contained 2632 subjects 
(1535 melanoma and 1097 NSCLC assessable subjects). The observed incidence of treatment 
emergent ADA in evaluable subjects was 1.7%, slightly increased relative to previously reported values 
(0.4 %) in melanoma indication. This slight higher incidence of ADA in NSCLC relative to the 
melanoma indication is likely the result of the ongoing optimization of the immunogenicity assay 
framework. The majority of the NSCLC data were analysed with the most recent assay at PPD which 
has a higher tolerance level for the presence of pembrolizumab and the considerably longer treatment 
durations included in the current analysis. 
At the recommended dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-
dose sample was below the drug tolerance level (<DTL) for about 81% of the subjects. Considering all 
treatments regimen, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose sample was below the 
drug tolerance level for about 41% of the subjects and for the dosing regimen of 10mg/kg the 
percentage of subjects with a pembrolizumab concentration <DTL in the last post-dose samples was of 
about 27%.  
The new assay with this high drug tolerance level allows conclusive assessment of the immunogenicity 
potential of pembrolizumab based on trough samples in 81% of patients at the proposed dose regimen 
of  2 mg/kg Q3W. At the dose of 10 mg/kg results from a high percentage of patients resulted 
inconclusive, but also considering the clinical data supporting the use of the 2 mg dose, this issue is no 
longer pursued.

The MAH is actually validating a new designed assay for the evaluation of neutralizing antibody (only 
data from 4 of the positive subjects are available at present). This validation will be finalized by end of 
2Q 2016 and the MAH will submit the final results by 3Q 2016 (see RMP). 
The pembrolizumab exposure for ADA positive subjects was similar to the exposure observed for 
negative subjects treated with the same dose regimen as already observed in the previous analysis. 
There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic with anti-pembrolizumab binding antibody 
development. 
Population PK Analysis  
An extension of the population PK analysis was conducted. The present analysis (report 0473LK) has 
built on the previous one that was updated and expanded to include data from 657 NSCLC patients 
from protocol P010 for a total of 2856 subjects included in the final analysis. Parameter estimates from 
both models are very similar.  
The addition of PK data from P010 did not alter the previous population PK data for pembrolizumab 
(report 044WBG) in a significant way. Race (white or Asian) as a covariate did not have a statistically 
significant impact on clinical exposure. 
Most intrinsic factors seem to have no relevant impact on pembrolizumab exposure (clearance). 
Specifically, age has no impact on exposure. Gender (independent of body weight), tumour type, renal 
and hepatic impairment, disease and albumin, while statistically significant, have at most small and 
not clinically relevant impact on exposure based on the established clinical bounds. 
Visualization of the impact of albumin on clearance has been provided further to CHMP request. 
Provided data show that the lower the albumin level, the higher the corresponding clearance. 
Clearance values have been stratified by low (< 0.35 g/dL) and normal range albumin (> 0.35 g/dL). 
Post-hoc median clearance value in subjects with low albumin is approximately one third higher 
compared to subjects with normal range albumin. The MAH’s explanation that albumin and the 
associated clearance variations likely reflect variation in disease severity (extent of cachexia and 
enhanced catabolism as a marker of end-stage cancer) is plausible. Data from subjects with severe 
hepatic and renal impairment were too sparse to draw a clinical conclusion from the data with respect 
to severe impairment. The influence of bilirubin as a marker for hepatic impairment could be 
associated with albumin. 
The effect of all statistically significant covariates was judged clinically not important, as the geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) of exposures and their computed 95% CIs remained within the established clinical 
bounds interval of 0.5 to 5, based on clinical dose- and exposure-response data. No high correlations 
were found between Albumin and Bilirubin (i.e. correlation coefficient=0.088) or any of the other 
covariates included in the formal covariate testing. 
PK/PD modelling 
Visual predictive checks were carried out to check the ability of the model to describe the new data 
from P010; those were stratified by dose. As acknowledged by the MAH, the VPCs demonstrate an 
under-prediction of pembrolizumab concentration at later time point. Further to the CHMP request, the 
MAH evaluated the potential for time-dependency in pembrolizumab PK to account for the discrepancy 
demonstrated by the VPC. An exploratory Kaplan-Meier of OS showed that the overall survival was 
associated with pembrolizumab clearance but not exposure (lower pembrolizumab clearance is 
associated with improved survival) and subjects with an initial higher CL tend to stay in the trial for 
shorter duration and therefore contribute less to PK concentration-time data than patients with lower 
CL. A series of structural PK models incorporating time-dependency in clearance have been explored. 
Results showed that there is a pattern in time-dependent clearance with response categories 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 29/116 
 
 
 
 
(progressive disease, stable disease, complete and partial disease), consistent with the hypothesized 
association between CL and OS. 
It is assumed that all patients starting treatment have higher clearance values probably because they 
are in a more advanced cachectic state (hyper-catabolism) associated with a more severe disease. If 
patients have a beneficial response to the drug, the hyper-catabolism may be reduced (cachectic state 
may be improved), while the cachectic state and so the hyper –catabolism increases in progressing 
patients. It can be hypothesised that variations on clearance (the dependency of clearance on albumin 
levels has also been shown) reflect variations in disease severity (extent of cachexia and hyper-
catabolism) is possible. 
As acknowledged by the MAH, the ETA shrinkage of the empirical Bayes estimates from the exposure-
response model of tumor size is moderate to high. Shrinkage was assigned to an unavoidable effect of 
sparse and heterogeneous data available at individual patient level. Provided qq plots showed 
deviations from normality of the random effect distributions on kgrowth (ETA1), fraction dying, f (ETA3) 
and especially kdeath (ETA2). Given that some shrinkage appears to be unavoidable, model predictions 
should be trusted with caution. 
Exposure-response analysis 
A Model-based analysis of the relationship between pembrolizumab (MK-3475) exposure and efficacy 
in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in PN001 and PN010 was performed (report 
0473KZ). There was no clear evidence of exposure dependency in response as also shown by the 
similar distribution of individual tumour response values across the AUCss-6weeks quintiles. Plots of 
simulated response rate show that there is only a light exposure-response dependency in tumour size 
response across doses ranging from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W. There is a little trend of increase 
in response and a parallel little decrease in progression both in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% than in 
patients with PD-L1 TPS <1%.  
The potential for exposure-dependency in OS in NSCLC patients from P010 was investigated using 
exploratory Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots, stratified by AUCss-6weeks quartile, thus comparing the OS with CL 
and exposure. The analysis considered a total of 651 patients (324 treated with a dose of 10 mg/kg 
Q3W and 327 patients with a dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W). Presented data show that the higher dose of 10 
mg/kg Q3W has no noticeable beneficial effect in comparison to 2 mg/kg Q3W. Within each dose 
group, there appears to be a strong relationship between AUC and OS. Irrespective of dose, a high 
AUC (low clearance) is associated with higher rate of overall survival (OS).  
OS of all four quartiles are comparable per dose group. In the pooled analysis, the survival curves 
associated within each quartile (e.g. 1st quartile of AUCss-6weeks from the 2mg/kg dose versus the 10 
mg/kg dose) are similar with overlapping confidence limits, despite the observed 5-fold difference in 
AUCss-6weeks values.  Moreover, the 2nd and 4th quartiles of AUC of the combined analysis (2 and 10 
mg/kg doses) shows the lowest CL value together with the improved OS relative to the 1st and 3rd 
quartiles of AUC, suggesting that exposure-OS relationship is strongly associated with 
pembrolizumab’s clearance rather to exposure. 
Secondly, the lack of a clear exposure-response relationship was also demonstrated by simulated 
median response rates at week 28, where the predicted proportion of patients with progressing tumour 
growth has been shown to be quite similar across wide dose ranges and close to the maximal response 
plateau of efficacy at a 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Thus, patients with low exposure (Q1, 2 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg group) regardless of PD-L1 expression have lower benefit regarding OS, but the data clearly 
indicate that dose adjustment would not alter this situation.

Subject age, EGFR mutation and PD-L1 expression status are significant predictors of tumour size 
response as suggested by the final results of the stepwise covariate model, and no other patient 
specific factors were found to be predictive of tumour size parameters. 
Exposure-Adverse Event analysis  
An  exposure-adverse  event  analysis  of  pembrolizumab  in  a  pooled  dataset of  patients  with  advanced 
melanoma and NSCLC form P001, P002, P006 and P010 studies was performed (report 0473LR). 
The  simulated  analysis  as  well  as  the  exploratory  plots  analysis  demonstrated  the  absence  of 
exposure-response  relationship  supporting  the  flat  exposure-response  of  pembrolizumab  for  these 
types of AEs (AEOSI) within the tested dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg. 
In the updated graphs provided by the MAH, all the binned observed data fall within (or near) the 90% 
confidence interval from the model. 
IHC to detect PD-L1 expression  
To evaluate the clinical performance of CRA a bridging study was conducted with a retrospective 
testing of banked tissue samples using the CRA based on clinical outcomes from study P010 that 
enrolled on a Clinical Trial Assay. Overall, the bridging analysis to compare the two assays (CTA and 
CRA) shows an unidirectional trend versus a more stringent selection with the new assay, with the 
most evident discordance observed for 136 specimens resulted negative (TPS<1%) with CRA and 
previously classified as weakly positive (1-49%) with CTA. Analyses of OS and PFS based on PD-L1 
expression detected by the new assay provided slightly stronger results than those obtained with the 
primary efficacy analysis conducted using CTA, especially in the overall population, and support the 
use of the new assay for the selection of patients. Whether, these results are driven solely by the 
difference in the monoclonal mouse anti PD-L1, or also by other factors is difficult to establish. 
Differences in the sample type used (tissue from resection vs biopsies) could have influenced the 
results.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab has been mainly characterised by means of a population PK model 
which is considered acceptable.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
- To submit the validation report for anti-pembrolizumab neutralizing antibody assay by September 
2016 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This  application  to  extend  the  Keytruda  therapeutic  indication  for  the  treatment  of  second  line  or 
greater  advanced  NSCLC  with  PD-L1  expression  is  based  on  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  phase 
II/III  trial  KEYNOTE-010,  comparing  two  pembrolizumab  doses  (2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg,  every  3 
weeks)  versus  docetaxel.  Data  from  the  phase  I  study  KEYNOTE-001  Cohorts  C  and  F,  enrolling 
previously treated NSCLC patients, were also submitted as supportive.

In study P001, an additional cohort (Part E), designed to characterize pembrolizumab in combination 
with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients was originally planned. However, no patients were enrolled and, 
as suggested by FDA, this cohort was removed and set up as a stand-alone study (KEYNOTE-021). 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No additional dose-response study was performed, and data are limited to those submitted at the time 
of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, from the escalation Part A of the phase I P001 trial.  
In the trial P010, submitted as pivotal to support this extension of indication, 2 pembrolizumab doses 
(2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W), including that already recommended for the treatment of 
melanoma patients, were tested with an opportunity to drop a poorly performing dose early in the 
study.

2.4.2.  Main study 
A Phase II/III Randomized Trial of Two Doses of MK-3475 versus Docetaxel in Previously 
Treated Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (KEYNOTE-010, P010). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
•  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC with at least one measurable lesion 
as  defined  by  RECIST  1.1.  The  target  lesion(s)  should  also  have  bi-dimensional  measurability 
for irRC evaluation on study. 
• 
Investigator determined radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 (from at least 2 dates) after 
treatment  with  at  least  two  cycles  of  a  platinum-containing  doublet  for  stage  IIIB/IV  or 
recurrent  disease.  Completion  of  treatment  with  a  platinum-containing  doublet  as  adjuvant 
therapy  within  one  year  of  signing  informed  consent  will  satisfy  the  prior  treatment 
requirement. 
o  Subjects  with  an  EGFR  sensitizing  mutation  must  also  be  able  to  demonstrate 
progression of disease on the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (either erlotinib, gefitinib, 
or afatinib).  
o  Subjects  with  an  ALK  translocation  must  also  be  able  to  demonstrate  progression  of 
disease on crizotinib.  
Subjects  with  an  EGFR  sensitizing  mutation  or  with  an  ALK  translocation  may  have  been 
treated  previously  with  the  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  separately  from  the  platinum-containing 
doublet; the order of treatment does not matter, but progression of disease as determined by 
RECIST  1.1  must  be  demonstrable  for  both  regimens.  An  exception  to  this  rule  is  the patient 
whose NSCLC tumour has an EGFR sensitizing mutation who receives four cycles of a platinum 
doublet, does not experience progression of disease, and begins therapy with an EGFR tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitor  as  a  maintenance  therapy  within  28  days  of  the  last  administration  of  the 
platinum  doublet  chemotherapy.  For  this  patient,  only  one  set  of  images  demonstrating 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 33/116 
 
 
 
 
 
progression on the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is required for submission to the independent 
imaging vendor for the patient to be eligible.  
• 
PD-L1  positive  (either  strongly  or  weakly)  tumour  as  determined  by  IHC  at  a  central 
laboratory.  If  the  initial  tumour  specimen  is  not  classified  as  PD-L1  positive  by  the  central 
laboratory, a newly obtained specimen may be submitted for testing.  
•  Age ≥18 years 
•  ECOG performance status of ≤ 1 
•  Newly  obtained  formalin  fixed  tissue  from  a  recent  biopsy  of  a  tumour  lesion  not  previously 
irradiated, for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. For patients in whom obtaining a new tumour biopsy 
will  be  medically  inappropriate,  an  archival  formalin-fixed,  paraffin-embedded  tumour 
specimen for PD-L1 could be submitted if agreed by the study clinical director. 
o 
o 
o 
Investigators must be able to produce the source documentation of the EGFR mutation 
status  or  ALK  translocation  status.  If  unable  to  test  for  these  molecular  changes, 
formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded  tumour  tissue  of  any  age  should  be  submitted  to  a 
central laboratory .  
If  a  patient  is  known  to  have  one  molecular  alteration  (either  sensitizing  EGFR 
mutation or ALK translocation), then testing for the other alteration is not required. 
If a patient is known to have a mutation in KRAS, then testing for an EGFR mutation or 
for  an  ALK  translocation  will  not  be  required,  given  that  all  of  these  molecular 
alterations are mutually exclusive in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. 
o  For  patients  enrolled  who  are  known  to  have  a  tumour  of  predominantly  squamous 
histology,  molecular  testing  for  EGFR  mutation  and  ALK  translocation  will  not  be 
required as this is not standard of care and is not part of current diagnostic guidelines.  
Main exclusion criteria were: 
• 
Prior therapy with docetaxel for NSCLC. 
•  Systemic steroid therapy within three days prior to the first dose of trial treatment or any other 
form of immunosuppressive medication. 
•  Need of any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on trial (including 
maintenance therapy with another agent for NSCLC or radiation therapy). 
• 
• 
Prior  systemic  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  antineoplastic  biological  therapy  (e.g.,  cetuximab), 
major  surgery  within  3  weeks;  thoracic  radiation  therapy  of  >  30  Gy  within  6  months;  prior 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or completed palliative radiotherapy within 7 days. 
Prior  therapy  with  an  anti-PD-1,  anti-PD-L1,  anti-PD-L2,  anti-CD137,  or  anti-Cytotoxic  T-
lymphocyte-associated  antigen-4  (CTLA-4)  antibody  (including  ipilimumab  or  any  other 
antibody  or  drug  specifically  targeting  T-cell  co-stimulation  or  checkpoint  pathways)  or 
participation in another pembrolizumab clinical trial. 
•  Known  history  of  prior  malignancy  except  if  the  patient  has  undergone  potentially  curative 
therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy. 
The time requirement does not apply to subjects who underwent successful definitive resection 
of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
skin, or in situ cervical cancer.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 34/116 
 
 
 
 
•  Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.  
•  Active autoimmune disease, or documented history of autoimmune disease, or syndrome that 
requires  systemic  steroids  or  immunosuppressive  agents.  Subjects  with  vitiligo  or  resolved 
childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Subjects that require inhaled steroid 
or  local  steroid  injections  will  not  be  excluded  from  the  study.  Subjects  with  hypothyroidism 
not  from  autoimmune  disease  and  stable  on  hormone  replacement  will  not  be  excluded  from 
the study. 
• 
Interstitial  lung  disease  or  a  history  of  pneumonitis  that  required  oral  or  intravenous 
glucocorticoids. 
Treatments 
Pembrolizumab  (2  mg/kg or  10  mg/kg)  was  administered  IV  every  3  weeks as  a  30  minute infusion, 
with a time window of -5 and +10 minutes. 
Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 was administered IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks. Pre-medications, including oral 
or injectable steroids, were administered as per standard practice. 
Patients randomised to docetaxel were pre-medicated with oral or injectable steroids according to the 
approved product label and/or standard practice. Additional pre-medications were administered as per 
standard practice. 
Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  or  docetaxel  was  planned  to  be  continued  until  two  years  or  less  in 
case of documented disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevented further 
administration  of  treatment,  Investigator’s  decision  to  withdraw  the  subject,  subject  withdrawal  of 
consent,  pregnancy  of  the  subject,  noncompliance with  trial  treatment  or procedure  requirements,  or 
discontinuation  due  to  administrative  reasons.  Treatment  could  be  interrupted  for  clinically  stable 
patients  assigned  who  experienced  disease  progression.  The  decision  to  continue  or  discontinue 
treatment  in  the  trial  could  be deferred  until  confirmation of  disease  progression  per  irRC  at least  28 
day from the date of radiological disease progression. In case of no disease progression confirmation, 
treatment could be resumed. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To compare the OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiologists’ review of previously 
treated NSCLC patients in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum. 
To  evaluate  OS  and  PFS  per  RECIST  1.1  by  independent  radiologists’  review  in  the  PD-L1 
positive population. 
Safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab in previously treated subjects with NSCLC in the TPS ≥ 
50% stratum and in the overall population was also among primary objectives. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
To evaluate ORR and response duration in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum and 
in the overall positive (TPS≥1%) study population. 
 Exploratory Objectives: 
• 
To  evaluate  PFS,  ORR,  response  duration  per  immune-related  response  criteria  (irRC)  by 
Investigators’  review  in  the  TPS≥50%  stratum  and  in  overall  positive  study  population

EMA/546566/2016  
Page 35/116 
 
 
 
 
(TPS≥1%). 
• 
• 
• 
To  evaluate  the  influence  of  age  of  tumour  specimen  (archival  vs  new)  submitted  for  PD-L1 
analysis on the primary endpoints PFS and OS. 
To  evaluate  tumour  volumetric  changes  and  to  explore  correlation  of  tumour  volumetric 
changes with OS in the TPS≥50% stratum.  
To evaluate changes in HRQoL assessments from baseline, and to characterize utilities and 
healthcare resource utilization in the TPS≥50% stratum and in the TPS>1% population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoints  were  OS  and  PFS  using  IRC  assessment  per  RECIST  1.1  in  the  TPS≥50% 
stratum and the TPS≥1% population. 
The secondary endpoints were ORR and time to response by IRC assessment by RECIST 1.1. 
The changes in HRQoL were assessed using the electronic EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 
items (eEORTC QLQ-C30) and the electronic EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 items 
(eEORTC QLQ-LC13). 
Patients were evaluated every 9 weeks (63±7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess response to 
treatment. Investigators made all treatment-based decisions using the irRC.  
Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  or  docetaxel  was  continued  until  two  years  of  therapy  had  been 
administered,  documented  disease  progression,  unacceptable  AEs,  intercurrent  illness  that  prevented 
further  administration  of  treatment,  Investigator’s  decision,  subject  withdrew  consent,  pregnancy, 
noncompliance, or for administrative reasons.  
Pembrolizumab-treated  patients  who  attained  an  Investigator-determined  confirmed  complete 
response (CR) per irRC could have considered stopping trial treatment. In case of radiographic disease 
progression these patients were eligible for re-treatment for up to one year with pembrolizumab at the 
Investigator discretion (Second Course Phase).  
Participation  in  this  trial  was  dependent  upon  supplying  tumour  tissue  for  PD-L1  analysis.  Specimens 
were  evaluated  at  a  central  laboratory  facility  for  PD-L1  expression  status  in  a  prospective  manner. 
Only patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 were eligible for randomization in this study. 
PD-L1 -expression 
The  PD-L1  expression  levels  were  measured  in  NSCLC  tumour  tissues  by  IHC  performed  on  tumour 
tissue on glass slides. Tumour tissue was analysed by the Dako Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) by using the 
22C3 clone against PD-L1.  
All  scoring  was  performed  by  pathologists.  An  evaluable  sample  must  have  contained  a  minimum  of 
100 tumour cells. The slides were evaluated using several scoring methods. A tumour proportion score 
(TPS)  reflecting  the  percentage  of  tumour  cells  exhibiting  membranous  staining  was  selected  as  the 
scoring  method  to  use  for  the  assay.  Tumours  with  at  least  1%  positive  staining  for  PD-L1  were 
considered  positive.  Since  the  Biomarker  Training  Set  defined  the  optimal  cutpoint  as  TPS≥50%, 
subjects  with  tumour  PD-L1  expression  above  this  cutpoint  were  referred  to  as  strongly  positive  for 
PD-L1 expression. Those subjects with tumours who had a TPS between 1% and 49% are referred to 
as  weakly  positive  for  PD-L1  expression.  Tumours  with  <1%  tumour  cells  positive  for  PD-L1  staining 
were considered negative. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 36/116 
 
 
 
 
After the study had started, the Sponsor became aware that PD-L1 antigens on the cut slides have the 
stability  window  of  6  months  for  the  CTA.  Therefore,  those  subjects  who  submitted  tumour  sample 
slides out of the stability window were excluded from the FAS analysis. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  targeted  to  be  approximately  460  for  strongly  PD-L1  positive  patients 
(TPS≥50%), and was projected to be approximately 920 patients for the overall population (TPS≥1%), 
based on an expected rate of strongly PD-L1 positive patients of around 50%.  
The  study  was  designed  as  event  driven,  with  the  number  of  patients  and  follow-up  time  subject  to 
change, and would be complete after approximately 200 deaths observed across the three arms in the 
TPS≥50%  stratum  (approximately  140  deaths  between  one  pembrolizumab  arm  and  the  docetaxel 
arm  under  the  alternative  hypothesis).  With  140  deaths  between  one  pembrolizumab  arm  and  the 
docetaxel  arm,  the  study  had  over  81%  power  to  detect  a  0.55  hazard  ratio  at  the  final  analysis, 
where  0.825%  alpha  was  allocated  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  vs.  docetaxel  comparisons  using 
Hochberg procedure.  
The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions for subjects in the strongly positive 
PD-L1 stratum: 1) overall survival follows an exponential distribution with a median of 9 months in the 
control arm, 2) the hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.60, 3) an enrollment period 
of 16 months and a minimum of 8 months follow-up after enrollment completion, 4) a dropout rate of 
2%  in  12  months.  The  assumed  median  overall  survival  time  of  9  months  for  docetaxel  treated 
patients  is  based  on  historical  data,  and  the  possible  positive  prognostic  nature  of  high  PD-L1 
expression levels. The median OS in docetaxel could be greater or less than 9 months in patients with 
strongly positive PD -L1 expression, if PD-L1 expression is prognostic for docetaxel. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  arms  (ratio  1:1:1)  via  a  central  Interactive  Voice 
Response  System  (IVRS)/Interactive  Voice  and  Web  Response  System  (IXRS)  in  block  of  six  in  each 
stratum. They were stratified according to PD-L1 expression, as tumour proportion score (TPS) ≥50% 
vs 1-49%, ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and Region (East Asia vs not East Asia). 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  conducted  in  an  open  label  fashion,  with  a  blinded  independent  radiologist  review  of 
responses. 
The  extent  of  tumour  PD-L1  expression  in  randomized  subjects  was  double-blinded.  The  subject,  the 
Investigator,  and  Sponsor  personnel  or  delegate(s)  who  were  involved  in  the  treatment  or  clinical 
evaluation of the subjects were unaware of the PD-L1 status. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  analyses  are  based  on  the  Intention  to  Treat  (ITT)  population  in  the  strongly 
positive PD-L1 stratum and the overall positive PD-L1 population. A supportive analysis was conducted 
in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  population  that  excludes  those  who  did  not  meet  the  critical  eligibility 
criteria or discontinued before receiving any dose of assigned treatment. All Patients Population (APaT) 
was  used  for  the  primary  analysis  of  safety  data.  The  Kaplan-Meier  method  is  used  to  estimate  the 
survival  (PFS  and  OS)  curves,  as  well  as  the  overall  survival  rate  at  1  year  by  treatment  group.  The 
treatment  difference  in  OS  and  PFS  is  assessed  by  the  stratified  log-rank  test.  A  stratified  Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling with a single treatment covariate is used 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016  
Page 37/116 
 
 
 
 
to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  difference  (i.e.,  the  hazard  ratio  and  95%  confidence 
interval). The same stratification factors used for randomization are applied to both the stratified log-
rank test and the stratified Cox model. The model based approach to handling missing data is used for 
the  primary  outcomes.  To  control  for  bias  induced  by  non-study  treatment  (i.e  patients  in  the 
docetaxel arm may receive other PD-1 treatment after discontinuation), it was planned to use a Rank 
Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time  (RPSFT)  model.  To  further  account  for  the  possible  confounding 
effect,  an  OS  sensitivity  analysis  censoring  patients  at  the  time  of  initiation  of  new  therapy  and  an 
additional analysis that treats initiation of new therapy as a time-dependent binary covariate were also 
planned. In case the proportional hazards assumption doesn’t hold it was planned to conduct Fleming 
and  Harrington’s  weighted  logrank  test  or  other  methods,  as  appropriate,  after  proper  adjustment  of 
the  crossover  effect  over  time.  Restricted  mean  survival  time  (RMST)  estimate  of  OS  and  PFS  over 
time was also calculated as an exploratory analysis. 
Three  PFS  sensitivity  analyses  with  a  different  set  of  censoring  rules  and  PD  event  definitions  under 
various  scenarios  were  planned.  The  censoring  rules  for  the  primary  and  sensitivity  PFS  analyses  are 
summarized in the following table. 
Table 15: Censoring rules for Primary and Sensitivity PFS analyses 
An exploratory analysis of pooled pembrolizumab arm vs. docetaxel was carried out for PFS or OS at 
the second interim and the final analyses in the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum as well as the overall 
PD-L1 positive population. The same stratified Cox proportional hazard model as that for the primary 
analysis was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to estimate the survival curves. 
For  comparison  of  the  ORR  between  the  treatment  groups,  the  stratified  Miettinen  and  Nurminen’s 
method was used. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. 
A 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates between each pembrolizumab arm and 
the  control  was  provided.  A  p-value  for  this  difference  was  provided  for  dose  selection  at  interim 
analyses. A subgroup ORR analysis is performed in patients followed up for 27 weeks, including early 
drop-outs. Subjects with missing data were considered non-responders. 
Response  duration  was  summarized  descriptively  using  Kaplan-Meier  medians  and  quartiles.  Non-
responders were excluded in this analysis.

EORTC-QLQC30,  EORTC  QLQ  LC-13,  EuroQoL  EQ-5D,  Health  Economic  Assessment  were  summarized 
as part of the exploratory analysis. 
Interim Analyses 
Two  planned  interim  analyses  occurred  during  the  conduct  of  this  trial.  The  table  below  summarizes 
the  strategy  and  timing  of  each  interim  analysis.  The  eDMC  reviewed  the  data,  and  the  study 
continued until the final analysis. 
Table 16: Strategy and planning of interim analyses 
Multiplicity Adjustment 
A  predefined  strategy  to  address  multiplicity  issues  with  regard  to  multiple  treatment  comparisons, 
multiple  efficacy  endpoints,  multiple  target  groups  and  interim  analyses  is  taken  into  account  (see 
figure below). At each analysis, the Hochberg step-up procedure is used for PFS and OS testing in the 
strongly  positive  PD-L1  stratum,  giving  equal  weights  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  arms,  if  neither  is 
prior discontinued. At each analysis, a gate-keeping testing procedure is used for adjustment over the 
strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and the overall PD-L1 positive population. If both pembrolizumab arms 
demonstrate  superior  PFS  in  the  strongly  positive  stratum,  PFS  is  then  tested  in  the  overall  PD-L1 
positive  population  at  the  same  alpha  level.  The  same  approach  is  applied  at  the  second  interim 
analysis for OS, while at the final analysis, a Bonferroni correction is used to adjust for the OS tests in 
strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and in the overall PD-L1 positive population; the level of significance 
for OS in the final analysis is set at 0.825% (i.e. 1.65/2) in light of the results observed for the PSF at 
the second interim and final analysis in both populations. Indeed, the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum 
and  the  overall  PD-L1  positive  population  was  planned  to  be  tested  at  α'/2  each,  where  α'  will  be 
between 1.65% and 2.00% and the actual alpha level depends on whether or not both MK-3475 arms 
are  superior  in  PFS  for  the  overall  positive  population  at  the  second  interim  analysis  and  the  final 
analysis.

Subgroup Analyses  
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the estimate of the 
between-group  treatment  effect  (with  a  nominal  95%  CI)  for  the  primary  endpoint  is  estimated  and 
plotted  within  each  category  of  the  following  classification  variables:  age  category  (≤65  vs.  >65 
years),  sex  (female,  male),  race  (white,  non-white),  ECOG  status  (0  vs.  1),  geographic  region  of 
enrolling site (East Asia, non-East Asia), ethnicity (East Asian, non-East Asian), previous chemotherapy 
regimen  (types  with  greater  than  10%  subjects  in  the  control  group),  ALK  translocation  status 
(translocated  vs.  wild  type),  EGFR  mutation  status  (wild  type  vs.  mutant),  age  of  tumour  specimen 
(archival vs. new).

Results 
Participant flow 
Herbst RS, Lancet 2015 
In the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg arm, one patient was excluded from efficacy analysis due to GCP non-
compliance issue of the enrolling site. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 198 trial centres in 24 countries. Overall, 1034 PD-L1 positive (TPS>1%) 
patients were enrolled from 28 August 2013 to 27 February 2015. The highest enrolling country was 
the US with a total of 224 subjects and the top recruiter site was in the Netherlands (25 patients). 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 11 protocol amendments, including global and country-specific changes, were implemented 
during the study. The original protocol (dated 16 November 2012) specified the inclusion of squamous 
NSCLC patients who experienced disease progression after a platinum-containing systemic therapy. 
 The key changes introduced by the protocol amendments are summarized below:

#11 (3 September 2015) 
Country specific (Germany) 
The  first  patients  were  screened  under  Amendment  #3  (global)  and  #4  (country-specific).  A  total  of 
441  patients  were  enrolled  prior  to  the  implementation  of  PD-L1  status  stratification  factor,  as  for 
Amendment  #8.  Collaborative  partner  audits  and  the  Investigator  site  compliance  (14  sites)  were 
conducted specific to study P010. 
Two formal interim analyses occurred during the conduct of this trial. The first interim analysis (futility) 
was  performed  on  01-Nov-2014  after  120  subjects  in  the  TPS≥50%  stratum  had  completed  a 
minimum of 3 months of follow-up; based on data, the eDMC recommended to continue the study with 
no modifications.  
The  second  interim  analysis  (31-Jul-2015)  was  triggered  after  approximately  175  PFS  events  per 
RECIST 1.1 by independent radiologists’ review across the three study arms in the TPS≥50% stratum, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

and based on data it was decided to continue the study.  
The final analysis (30-Sep-2015) was carried out when 204 deaths occurred across the 3 study arms in 
the TPS≥50% stratum. 
Baseline data 
In study P010, for the PD-L1 analysis a new tumour sample was available for 578 (55.95%) patients 
and  an  archival  tumour  sample  was  provided  for  455  (44.05%)  patients.  The  baseline  characteristics 
for patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and TPS ≥1% are shown below:

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population in the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum (TPS ≥50%) and the overall PD-L1 positive 
population (TPS ≥1%) served as the primary population for the efficacy analyses.  
A supportive efficacy analysis was conducted in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that excluded patients who 
did  not  meet  the  key  eligibility  criteria  or  discontinued  before  receiving  any  dose  of  assigned 
treatment. The FAS population was also used for the pre-specified exploratory PRO analysis. 
Primary safety analyses were carried out in all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
treatment (APaT population) in the TPS≥50% stratum and the TPS>1% population.

Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Analyses 
There  were  three  electronic  questionnaires  used in  this  study:  eEORTC  QLQ-C30,  eEORTC  QLQ-LC13, 
and eEQ-5D-3L. 
The primary analysis approach for the pre-specified exploratory PRO endpoints was based on a quality 
of  life  related  FAS  population,  including  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
study medication and completed at least one PRO assessment. 
- eEORTC QLQ-C30 Analyses are summarised in the below figures.

- eEORTC QLQ-LC13 Analyses. 
Subjects in both pembrolizumab arms had a numerical improvement from baseline to Week 12 in most 
EORTC  lung  cancer  symptoms.  This  improvement  was  more  pronounced  for  the  2  mg/kg  dose  in  the 
TPS≥50%  stratum.  In  contrast,  subjects  in  the  docetaxel  arm  had  a  numerical  worsening  from 
baseline in most EORTC lung cancer symptoms. With few exceptions, both pembrolizumab arms had a 
superior numerical change from baseline in EORTC lung cancer symptom scores compared to docetaxel 
and  many  of  these  achieved  statistical  significance.  Compared  to  docetaxel,  pembrolizumab  also 
increased  the  time  to  true  deterioration  in  the  QLQ-LC13  composite  endpoint  of  cough,  dyspnea  and 
chest pain. Unlike traditional deterioration, true deterioration requires a second adjacent 10 points or 
more score decrease from baseline under right-censoring rule. 
•  Summary of eEQ-5D-3L Analysis 
The  eEQ-5D  provides  data  for  use  in  economic  models  and  analyses  on  health  utilities  or  quality-
adjusted  life  years.  Minimal  descriptive  statistics  were  included  in  the  PRO  SAP  for  eEQ-5D.  Results 
from  eEQ-5D  VAS  analyses  are  consistent  with  the  results  of  EORTC  QLQ-C30  analyses  (data  not 
shown).

Efficacy results for weakly positive (1%≤ TPS <50%) stratum 
In the weakly positive (1%≤ TPS <50%) stratum, both pembrolizumab doses were superior to 
docetaxel in terms of OS by individual arms (HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.04 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
and HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.94 for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg) and by pooled analysis (HR 0.76, 95% 
CI: 0.60, 0.96 for pooled pembrolizumab). The median OS for pembrolizumab was 9.4 months and 
10.8 months for the 2 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared to 8.6 months for docetaxel.

Restricted Mean Survival Times Analysis of PFS in TPS≥50% Stratum 
Comparison  of  restricted  mean  survival  times  (RMST)  of  PFS  provides  an  assessment  of  treatment 
effect over a time interval. It provides an alternative estimate of the treatment effect that is robust to 
the proportional hazard assumption. The treatment effect of pembrolizumab on PFS was demonstrated 
by Kaplan-Meier analysis where a separation of the curves was observed after Month 3 and continued 
all the  way  towards the  tail  end  when  the  majority of  subjects in  the  docetaxel  arm  had  PFS  events. 
The mean PFS up to a certain follow-up time provides meaningful additional information compared to 
the median PFS in this situation, e.g., the RMST at  Month 6 was 4.18 and 4.16 for pembrolizumab 2 
mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg,  respectively,  compared  to  3.78  for  docetaxel.  The  differences  between 
pembrolizumab and docetaxel RMST values continue to increase at each subsequent time point.  
Subgroups analyses 
Data from the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg were pooled for the subgroup analyses.

To support the claimed indication, an interim CSR from the NSCLC parts (Cohort C and Cohort F) of the 
multicenter,  open  label  phase  I  P001  trial,  whose  data  on  melanoma  patients  were  submitted  at  the 
time  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  Application,  was  provided  with  a  minimum  of  6-months  of 
follow-up (database cut-off of 23-Jan-2015).  
Different pembrolizumab doses and  schedules were tested across NSCLC Cohorts: 10 mg/kg every 3 
weeks,  in  patients    with  prior  systemic  therapy  (Cohort  C),  PD-L1  positive  treatment  naïve  patients 
(Cohort  F1)  and  PD-L1  positive  previously  treated  patients  (Cohort  F2);  10  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  in 
PD-L1  positive  treatment  naïve  patients  (Cohort  F1)  and  in  previously-treated  patients  both  PD-L1 
negative  or  positive  (Cohort  F2);  2  mg/kg  every  3  weeks  in  PD-L1  positive  treatment  naïve  patients 
(Cohort F1) and PD-L1 positive previously treated patients. 
A total of 560 NSCLC patients were allocated to Cohorts C and F of study P001.

The median duration of follow up is 15.7 months (range 10.0 to 32.3 months) for Cohort C, Cohort F2, 
and  Cohort  F1.  Due  to  the  late  starting  of  enrollment,  Cohort  F-3  has  a  median  follow-up  of  7.7 
months (range 6.4 to 9.7 months). 
The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the dosing arms. Overall, the median age was 
64  years;  most  of  patients  were  former  smokers  (66.9%)  and  had  metastatic  disease  (96.2%).  The 
non-squamous was the most common histology (81.1%), and in the majority of patients (67.2%) ≥2 
prior  lines  of  therapy  were  administered.    Fifty-eight  (10.5%)  patients  presented  baseline  brain 
metastases. 
The  study  primary  endpoint  was  ORR,  based  on  RECIST  1.1  by  IRC.  The  secondary  measure  for 
assessment of tumor response (ORR) was based on irRC by Investigator assessment. Disease control 
rate (DCR), duration of response, and PFS based on both RECIST 1.1 and irRC, and OS were evaluated 
as secondary endpoints. 
The  pre-specified  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  in  the  Previously  Treated  Primary  Efficacy 
Population,  a  subset  of  61  patients  in  Cohort  F2  comprising  the  Biomarker  Validation  Set    who  had 
tumor  PD-L1  expression  ≥50%  at  baseline,  as  determined  by  a  different  IHC  assay  using  the  22C3 
clone,  a  Market-Ready  Assay.  All  patients  previously  received  a  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and 
experienced progression.  
Supportive  analyses  were  also  conducted  in  Previously  Treated  Validation  Population  including    223  
patient  from  Cohort  F2  who  progressed  after  at  least  platinum-based  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  were 
part of the Biomarker Validation Set and had PD-L1 expression ≥1% at baseline (patients).

Cohort F-3 (PD-L1 positive previously treated population - 2 mg/kg Q3W) 
Cohort F-3 was added with the last amendment to the protocol to study the likely dose for 
pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC, i.e., 2 mg/kg Q3W, therefore follow up is shortest in these 
subjects with a minimum of 27 weeks of follow up. The inclusion criteria for Cohort F-3 are identical to 
Cohort F-2. The only difference between these cohorts is that in F-3, all subjects received 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and in F-2 all subjects received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or Q2W. 
For Cohort F-3 (n=55) the cumulative ORR at Week 27 was 14.7% (95% CI: 7.6, 27.3) compared to 
21.1% (95% CI: 16.8, 26.5) for PD-L1 pos. subjects of F2 (n=280). 6-month PFS rates were 33.6% 
for Cohort F-3 and 37.2% for Cohort F-2. Cohort F-3 had a 6-month OS rate of 58.8%, and the 
randomized subjects of Cohort F-2 had an OS rate of 66.0%. 
Development of Companion diagnostic 
Dako  has  been  collaborating  with  MSD 
in  the  development  of  a  companion  diagnostic 
immunohistochemical  (IHC)  assay,  PD-L1  IHC  22C3  pharmDx,  to  detect  PD-L1  protein  expression  in 
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) tissue samples. 
This commercial ready assay (CRA) (abbreviated ‘Dako PD-L1 CRA’ in this document) uses an anti PD-
L1 mouse monoclonal antibody MEB037.22C3.138 (‘22C3’) that is optimized for automated use on the 
Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform for detection of PD-L1 expression.  
An  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  clinical  trial  assay  (CTA)  (abbreviated  ‘Dako  PD-L1  CTA’  in  this 
document), was used to screen patients prior to enrolment into the pembrolizumab KEYNOTE 010 (see 
clinical efficacy). 
The primary difference between Dako PD-L1 CTA and Dako PD-L1 CRA is that the primary antibody for 
the  CTA  IHC  assay  was  supplied  by  Merck,  whereas  the  primary  antibody  for  the  CRA  IHC  assay  is 
manufactured by Dako. 
Table 44: CTA and CRA similarities and differences 
A bridging study was conducted to establish the clinical performance of the CRA, in conjunction with an 
accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP). (Retrospective Testing of Banked NSCLC Tissue Samples 
Using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx CRA to compare and Evaluate Clinical Performance Based on Clinical 
Outcomes from Clinical Study MK-3475- 010/KEYNOTE-010 that enrolled on a CTA). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 69/116 
 
  
  
 
 
The primary objectives in the SAP were: 
1.  To  estimate  agreement  between  the  CTA  and  the  CRA  for  the  IHC  outcomes  of  being  “PD-L1 
Negative” or “PD-L1 Positive” or “PD-L1 Strongly Positive” (1% and 50% cut-off points). 
2. To test the primary hypotheses of KEYNOTE-010 comparing pembrolizumab to docetaxel within the 
“PD-L1 positive” and “PD-L1 strongly positive” subpopulations with respect to the CRA under an intent-
to-treat (ITT) framework. 
3.  To  conduct  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  understand  the  plausible  range  for  the  hazard  ratio  estimated 
based  on  the  CRA  in  the  “PD-L1  positive”  and  “PD-L1  strongly  positive”  subpopulations  under  an 
intent-to-diagnose (ITD) framework. 
Results 
Bridging Analysis 
Dako PD-L1 CTA was used as the reference study and negative percent agreement (NPA) and positive 
percent agreement (PPA) estimates were calculated for tumour proportion score 1% (cut-off for PD-L1 
positive) and 50% (cut-off for PD-L1 strongly positive) along with 95% confidence intervals. 
Agreement Estimates 
Results in the panels using the 1% and 50% cut-offs are reflected in the table below. 
For  the  1%  cut-off,  PD-L1  positive  is  defined  as  TPS  ≥  1%  and  PD-L1  negative  is  defined  as  TPS  < 
1%, and for the 50% cut-off PD-L1 positive is defined as TPS ≥ 50% and PD-L1 negative is defined as 
TPS < 50%. Note that the category of TPS 1-49% is considered to be PD-L1 positive for the 1% cut-
off, and is considered to be PD-L1 negative for the 50% cut-off.

For the bridging study, results from the analysis of overall survival (OS) in Panel 12-14 show that for 
the  patients  with  a  CRA  measurement  that  was  within  the  stability  window  (the  complete  case 
analysis) both the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W doses are superior to docetaxel at 
the  significance  threshold of  nominal  p-value  <0.00825  (pre-specified  in  the  protocol  for the  primary 
analyses in using the CTA) for both the strongly positive and positive PD-L1 status definitions.

only the MK-3475 10 mg/kg vs. docetaxel comparison in the PD-L1 strongly positive patients met the

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  P010  is  a  randomized  trial  comparing  two  pembrolizumab  doses  (2  mg/kg  and  10 
mg/kg,  every  3  weeks)  versus  docetaxel  in  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  (Stage  IIIB/IV)  PD-L1 
positive (TPS≥1%) NSCLC patients previously treated with at least two cycles of a platinum-containing 
doublet. Patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were eligible provided they had 
progressed  on  both  TKIs  and  platinum-based  chemotherapy:  although  this  inclusion  may  have 
introduced  some  further  heterogeneity  in  the  patient  population,  it  is  considered  acceptable  as  it 
increases the external validity of the trial. Overall, the eligibility criteria are acceptable. The choice to 
include  all  NSCLC  histologies  limited  to  PD-L1  positive  (TPS≥1%)  tumours  is  based  on  data 
accumulating  from  Study  P001  supporting  the  potential  predictive  value  of  PD-L1  expression 
regardless the histology, and is acceptable. Patients with brain metastases (non-active) were eligible, 
which  is  acceptable.  From  Amendment  #8  onwards,  i.e  after  the  enrolment  of  the  first  441  patients, 
newly obtained biopsies were required for the evaluation of PD-L1 expression. However, for patients in 
whom  obtaining  a  new  biopsy  was  deemed  inappropriate,  archival  tissue  was  accepted.  Whether 
changes  in  PD-L1  expression  are  to  be  expected  during  the  natural  course  of  the  disease  (i.e.  in 
treatment naïve and after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or TKIs) is at present unknown. 
The primary objectives of the study were to compare the OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent 
radiologists’ review of previously treated NSCLC patients with tumour samples designated as strongly 
positive  (TPS≥50%)  PD-L1  stratum,  and  in  the  overall  patient  population  that  had  tumour  samples 
which  were  designated  as  PD-L1  positive.  Safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  pembrolizumab  was  also 
among  primary  objectives.  ORR,  response  duration  and  changes  in  HRQoL  were  among  secondary 
objectives. 
The  sample  size  was  targeted  to  be  approximately  460  for  strongly  PD-L1  positive  patients 
(TPS≥50%),  and  the  study  had  over  81%  power  to  detect  a  0.55  hazard  ratio  at  the  final  analysis, 
where  0.825%  alpha  was  allocated  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  vs.  docetaxel  comparisons  using 
Hochberg  procedure.  In  the  protocol  the  MAH  provided  also  the  Minimum  Detectable  Hazard  Ratios 
(MDHR) for  positive  OS and PFS in  the  PD-L1  strongly  positive stratum  at  the  final  analysis. The 
target MDHR was stronger for OS (<0.675, i.e. >4.3 m of improvement) with regard to PFS (<0.787, 
i.e.  >2.4  m  of  improvement)  which  is  not  surprising  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
pembrolizumab  compared  to  docetaxel,  and  the  higher  probability  to  induce  durable  responses  and 
thus show a higher probability to show a benefit in the long run. Therefore, OS analyses are expected 
to capture the benefit of the therapy better than PFS analyses. 
Two  planned  interim  analyses  occurred  during  the  conduct  of  this  trial.  Interim  Analysis  1(IA1)  was 
performed after 120 subjects in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum completed a minimum 
of  3  months  of  follow-up,  ant  its  primary  objective  of  IA1  was  to  stop  the  study  for  futility  or 
discontinue one pembrolizumab arm if it was less efficacious than the other pembrolizumab arm based 
on  ORR  in  the  strongly  positive  (TPS≥50%)  PD-L1  stratum.  However,  after  IA1  the  study  continued 
without modifications. Interim Analysis 2 (IA2) was planned at the time of primary PFS analysis after  
approximately 175 PFS events had  occurred in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum.  The 
eDMC reviewed the data, and the study continued until the final analysis. The statistical methods are 
overall acceptable.  
The  statistical  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoints  and  for  the  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints, 
including  the  sensitivity  analyses  and  the  censoring  rules,  are  adequate  for  the  type  of  variables 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 74/116 
 
  
  
 
analyzed.  Results  of  OS  sensitivity  analyses,  censoring  at  the  time  new  anti-cancer  therapy  and 
subsequent immunotherapy started were provided. The significant benefit in OS was confirmed in both 
TPS≥1% and TPS≥50%. Comparison of restricted mean survival times (RMST) of PFS, which provides 
an  alternative  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect  that  is  robust  to  the  proportional  hazard  assumption, 
has been planned and submitted. 
The multiplicity strategy is overall acceptable. In light of the results observed for the PSF at the second 
interim and at the final analysis, the level of significance in the final analysis in both populations is set 
at 0.825% (p=0.00825) for OS and 0.1% (p=0.001) for PFS.  
A  total  of  1034  patients  were  randomised  1:1:1  to  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  (n=344),  to 
pembrolizumab  10  mg/kg  (n=346)  and  to  docetaxel  (n=343).  Screen  failure  was  mostly  due  to  not 
meeting the inclusion criteria of PD-L1 positivity (830 patients), or to unavailability of tissue for PD-L1 
biomarker  analysis  (260).  In  addition,  the  presence  of  known  active  CNS  metastases  and/or 
carcinomatous meningitis excluded patients from enrolment in the trial (78 patients). The rate of PD-
L1 strongly (TPS≥50%) and weakly positive (TPS 1>49%) was around 40% and 60%, respectively, in 
both  the  overall  PD-L1  positive  screened  (1475)  and  enrolled  subjects  (1034);  this  consistency  is 
reassuring  with  regard  to  the  representativeness  of  the  ITT  population  (i.e.  there  is  no  apparent 
overrepresentation of strongly positive patients), which is deemed very important for the reliability of 
the results in the overall population of patients that have tumours expressing PD-L1. It is noted that a 
higher  number  of  patients  did  not  receive  treatment  as  assigned  in  the  control  arm.  Furthermore,  a 
quite  higher  number  of  patients  in  the  docetaxel  arm  discontinued  treatment  for  reason  other  than 
progressive disease, namely withdrawal of consent and physician’s decision. In the context of an open 
label trial this is likely occurring due to patients and physicians’ awareness of the treatment assigned. 
Overall,  there  are  no  meaningful  imbalances  in  patients’  baseline  characteristics  among  treatment 
arms,  and  the  enrolled  population  is  representative  of  real  life  EU  patients.  Not  all  enrolled  patients 
met key eligibility criteria (e.g. prior chemotherapy, ECOG PS, etc.). However, the numbers are quite 
limited and supportive efficacy analysis (FAS) was conducted excluding those patients not meeting the 
key  eligibility  criteria  or  discontinued  before  receiving  any  dose  of  assigned  treatment,  and  has  been 
provided. 
Data  from  the  phase  I  study  KEYNOTE-001  Cohorts  C  and  F,  enrolling  previously  treated  NSCLC 
patients, were also submitted as supportive.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  benefit  in  OS  has  been  observed  for  both 
pembrolizumab  arms  over  docetaxel  in  subjects  with  TPS≥50%  (HR  of  0.54,  p=0.00024,  and  0.50, 
p=0.00002,  for  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  Q3W  vs  docetaxel,  respectively),  and  in  the 
overall  population  of  subjects  with  TPS≥1%  (HR  of  0.71,  p=0.00076,  and  0.61,  p<0.00001,  for 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively).  
A statistically significant difference has been observed for PFS in the strongly positive subgroup only, 
with HRs of 0.58 and 0.59 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg vs docetaxel, respectively. The 
median PFS was 5.2 months for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, and 4.1 months for docetaxel. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  PFS  curves  show  a  clear  separation  only  after  some  months,  and  this  pattern  is 
observed also in the overall population PD-L1 positive population. In both subjects with TPS≥50% and 
the overall study population of subjects with TPS≥1% there is a trend to an increase in the difference 
in the rate of event-free patients between the experimental and the control arms at subsequent time 
points.  
Supportive  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  for  PFS  were  provided.  The  PFS  results  based  on 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 75/116 
 
  
  
Investigator assessment by irRC were similar to the results by IRC assessment per RECIST 1.1 in both 
the TPS≥50% and TPS≥1%population. The PFS sensitivity censoring rule analyses confirm the results 
of the primary analysis, with a reduced, but still clinically significant advantage also in the strongly PD-
L1  positive  population.  The  RMST  analysis  of  PFS  provided  to  account  the  possible  violation  of 
proportional  hazard  assumption  show  that  the  differences  between  pembrolizumab  and  docetaxel 
RMST  values  continue  to  increase  over  time,  which  support  the  potential  benefit  of  pembrolizumab 
based  on  its  mechanism  of  action  compared  to  docetaxel  and  its  ability  to  induce  more  durable 
responses. 
No  meaningful  differences  have  been  observed  between  the  two  pembrolizumab  dose  levels  for  both 
OS and PFS.  
The  OS  results  observed  in  the  overall  population  are  clearly  driven  by  the  effect  observed  in  the 
strongly  positive  subgroup.  However,  when  taking  into  account  the  complementary  weakly  positive 
subgroup  (for  which  a  formal  analysis  was  not  planned)  the  visual  inspection  of  OS  survival  curves 
shows a separation of the curves over time with a trend to an increase in the difference in the rate of 
patients  alive  between  the  experimental  and  the  control  arms  at  subsequent  time  points.  When 
analysing  the  PFS  Kaplan  Meier  curves  in  the  complementary  weakly  positive  population,  the  curves 
appear  superimposed  with  no  apparent  benefit  for  the  experimental  arms  over  docetaxel.  However, 
based  on the  different  mechanism  of  action  and  expected pattern  of  response  to pembrolizumab  and 
docetaxel  it  is  not  unexpected  that  OS  analysis  may  capture  the  potential  benefit  of  pembrolizumab 
better than PFS. Indeed, as reported below, the duration of response observed with pembrolizumab is 
much longer than what observed with docetaxel, even in the weakly positive subgroup. 
The ORR was higher for pembrolizumab in TPS≥50% subjects (30.2% and 29.1% in the 2 mg/kg and 
10  mg/kg  arms,  respectively,  vs  7.9%  in  the  docetaxel  arm,  p=<0.00001),  and  in  the  overall 
population  (18%  and  18.5%  in  the  2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  arms,  respectively,  vs  9.3%  in  the 
docetaxel  arm),  with  no  difference  observed  between  the  two  pembrolizumab  dose  levels.  In  the 
complementary  weakly  positive  subgroup  no  difference  in  terms  of  ORR  was  observed  between 
pembrolizumab and docetaxel (9.8% and 10.3% in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, respectively, vs 
10.5% in the docetaxel arm). However, the duration of response based on IRC assessment was almost 
double in pembrolizumab treated subjects compared to docetaxel even in the weakly positive subgroup 
(46  and  45  weeks  in  the  2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  arms,  respectively,  vs  26  weeks  in  the  docetaxel 
arm). 
The  treatment  effect  of  pembrolizumab  was  superior  for  subjects  with  TPS≥50%  compared  to  the 
overall study population with TPS≥1% across all endpoints (OS, PFS and ORR). However, also for the 
overall study population with TPS≥1% statistically significant and clinically meaningful HRs for OS are 
demonstrated for the pembrolizumab treatment groups in comparison to the docetaxel arm, supported 
by  a  numerically  superior  (although  not  statistically  significant)  HR  for  PFS.  For  both  primary 
endpoints, the Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated separation after several months without crossing of 
the curves. 
The  MAH  provided  additional  analyses  to  inform  on  the  impact  of  various  tumour  PD-L1  expression 
levels on efficacy. Forest plots of OS are presented for subgroups with TPS 1-49% (“weakly positive”), 
with  TPS  1st  to  4th  quartiles  and  for  different  cut-offs  of  TPS  (≥5  %  and  ≥10  %).  The  HR  results 
indicate that an OS benefit is demonstrated for all subgroups and that the superior treatment effect of 
pembrolizumab over docetaxel does not appear to be driven solely by the subgroups with high tumour 
expression levels. However, with regard to the endpoints PFS (HR) and ORR, subjects in the 1%≤TPS 
<50%  stratum  did  not  derive  superior  benefit  from  pembrolizumab  compared  to  docetaxel  in 
exploratory analyses (with crossing of Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS). But longer response duration for 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 76/116 
 
  
  
pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel was also confirmed in this subgroup, likely contributing to the 
effect on OS. 
Based  on  preliminary  efficacy  results  of  P001,  two  different  pembrolizumab  doses  were  evaluated  in 
study  P010.  The  KM  curves  for  both  pembrolizumab  groups  are  superimposed  in  the  initial  parts  and 
separate  after  some  months,  both  for  the  OS  and  the  PFS  curves.  From  the  visual  inspection  of  the 
curves, the higher pembrolizumab dose group of 10 mg/kg appears to be slightly superior compared to 
the dose of 2 mg/kg in all figures. However, pairwise comparisons did not show meaningful HRs for OS 
or  PFS  for  the  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  group  relative  to  the  10  mg/kg  group  (range  of  HRs  1.0  – 
1.17).  Additionally,  ORR  did  not differ  between  both  pembrolizumab  dose  groups.  Exposure-response 
analyses  indicated  that  there  is  little  if  any  additional  benefit  available  at  higher  exposures.  Overall, 
the  observed  differences  are  considered  small  and  not  sufficient  to  object  the  dose  selection  of  2 
mg/kg Q3W also for the NSCLC indication.  
No major differences in OS across pembrolizumab doses can be highlighted based on tumour histology 
and  PD-L1  expression.  Although  there  is  a  general  trend  for  a  better  efficacy  of  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W 
particularly in PD-L1 weakly positive subjects with non-squamous histology, a dose–exposure response 
analysis  by  NSCLC  histology  based  on  KN010  shows  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  two 
pembrolizumab  doses  at  each  TPS  cut  points  (>50%  and  >1%)  for  reduction  in  tumour  size  both  in 
non-squamous and squamous histology.  In particular, in the non-squamous subgroup there is a trend 
to an increased response in the lowest quintile in TPS 1-49%.  
The  lack  of  meaningful  difference  between  the  two  pembrolizumab  dose  levels  observed  in  all  the 
efficacy analyses including Quality of life data further supports the adequacy of the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose 
level. 
No  new  insights  were  provided  from  efficacy  results  submitted  by  the  MAH  for  study  KN010  using 
additional PD-L1 expression cut-off values (1% ≤TPS <10% and 10%≤ TPS <50%). 
Consistently to what was observed in the primary analyses, the benefit observed in the strongly PD-L1 
positive  patients  appears  more  robust  also  in  subgroup  analyses  in  comparison  to  the  overall 
population and the complementary weakly positive subgroup. 
In  subgroup  analyses,  a  reduced  survival  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  docetaxel  was 
observed  for  patients  who  were  never-smokers,  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  EGFR  activating 
mutations  or  East  Asian  patients  who  received  at  least  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and  a  tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitor;  however,  due  to  the  small  numbers  of  patients,  no  definitive  conclusions  can  be 
drawn from these data. 
A  consistent  improvement  in  OS  and  PFS  was  reported  with  pembrolizumab  over  docetaxel  in 
sensitivity  analyses  conducted  excluding  patients  who  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  consent 
withdrew or physician’decision. 
Based  on  a  subgroup  analysis  by  the  number  of  prior  therapies  (1  versus  ≥2  lines),  the  superior 
benefit of pembrolizumab over docetaxel in the overall study population appears to be solely driven by 
the treatment effect in subjects with only one prior line of therapy. Patients with two or more lines of 
prior therapy do not seem to have a superior outcome with pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel. A 
reduced  treatment  effect  in  patients  with  more  advanced  disease  is  in  line  with  what  has  been 
previously  observed  for  nivolumab  in  the  same  indication  and  might  be  expected  from  the  mode  of 
action of checkpoint inhibitors that depends on an efficient immune system and requires a longer time 
to exert an effect.  
As from the prior nivolumab experience, in non-squamous NSCLC the pembrolizumab effect seems to 
be determined by the level of PD-L1 expression, with an OS HR ranging from 0.67 to 0.49 at the dose 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 77/116 
 
  
  
of 2 mg/kg and from 0.58 to 0.45 at 10 mg/kg based on TPS ≥1% and TPS  ≥50%, respectively. On 
the other hands, the percentage of TPS is not related to OS benefit in squamous NSCLC. 
In study KEYNOTE-010, patients were screened by an IHC clinical trial assay (Dako PD-L1 CTA) which 
is an earlier version of the companion diagnostic IHC assay (Dako PD-L1 CRA) proposed by the MAH. 
To  evaluate  the  clinical  performance  of  the  commercial  ready  assay  (CRA),  a  bridging  study  for 
KEYNOTE-010  retrospectively  tested  banked  formalin  fixed  and  paraffin  embedded  (FFPE)  NSCLC 
tissue samples available from screened patients. Even if the variability of PD-L1 expression within the 
tumour  and,  consequently,  the  possibility  of  discordant  results  produced  by  analytical  tests  is 
acknowledged,  overall  the  available  efficacy  outcomes,  in  terms  of  OS  and  PFS,  support  the  use  of 
Dako PD-L1 CRA (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx) for the selection of NSCLC patients. 
When  assessing  the  PD-L1  status  of  the  tumour,  it  is  important  that  a  well-validated  and  robust 
methodology is chosen to minimise false negative or false positive determinations. 
The efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with tumours that do not express PD-L1 have not 
been established. 
Similarly to the melanoma indication, the MAH  will further explore the value of biomarkers to predict 
the efficacy of pembrolizumab in NSCLC studies. 
In the supportive study P001 a clear benefit in terms of ORR, PFS and OS has been observed for the 
strongly PD-L1 positive subgroup over the weakly positive or negative subgroups. The ORR was 36.3% 
in strongly PD-L1 positive, 13.2% in weakly PD-L1 positive and 8.1% in negative subjects (TPS<1%) 
PD-L1.  Even  though  a  similar  median  PFS  and  OS  were  observed  in  weakly  PD-L1  positive  and 
negative patients, the difference in PFS and OS rate tend to increase over time, with a higher rate for 
weakly PD-L1 positive vs negative subjects at 12 months.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS over docetaxel has been observed for 
both subjects with TPS≥50% and with TPS≥1% with pembrolizumab in the target population of adult 
patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have disease progression on or 
after prior chemotherapy. A statistically significant difference has been observed for PFS in the strongly 
positive  subgroup  only.  It  can  however  be  concluded  that  the  benefit  from  pembrolizumab  is  not 
limited to the strongly positive subgroup. 
There  are  no  meaningful  differences  among  the  two  pembrolizumab  doses,  supporting  the  proposed 
2mg/kg Q3W dose, already recommended in the melanoma indication. Further support comes from the 
observation  that  statistical  significance  for  PROs  was  achieved  for  the  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  dose 
only.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, 
specifically: 
Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in NSCLC patients, durable responses have been 
observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy 
should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1 
obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024, and P042):

The known pembrolizumab safety profile, at present based on 1567 melanoma patients treated across 
studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002  and  KEYNOTE-006  is  mainly  associated  with  immune-related 
adverse  reactions  and    characterized  by  general  (fatigue),  gastrointestinal  (diarrhoea  and  nausea), 
skin (rash and pruritus) and muskuloskeletal (arthralgia) disorders. The majority of adverse reactions 
reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity and the most serious were immune-related adverse reactions 
and severe infusion-related reactions. 
The  submitted  safety  database  includes  1232  NSCLC  patients  (from  studies  KEYNOTE-010  and 
KEYNOTE-001)  and  1567  melanoma  patients  (from  studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002  and 
KEYNOTE-006) who received at least one pembrolizumab dose.  
Patient exposure 
In the pivotal NSCLC study P010, the mean treatment duration was higher in the pembrolizumab arms 
(155.4 days at 10 mg/kg Q3W and 151.1 days at 2 mg/kg Q3W) compared to docetaxel (81.6 days).  
Overall,  the  mean  exposure  was  greater  in  melanoma  compared  to  NSCLC  patients  (227.80  days 
vs.160.25 days). In a total of 418 and 165 NSCLC patients the duration of exposure to pembrolizumab 
was  ≥6  months  and  ≥12  months,  respectively.  Considering  the  pooled  NSCLC  and  melanoma 
populations, 1153 and 600 patients were respectively exposed to pembrolizumab ≥6 months and ≥12 
months.

Table 56: Exposure and Duration (PN001, PN002, PN006 and PN010) - Melanoma and Lung patients 
treated with pembrolizumab (APaT Population) 
Demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  pooled  melanoma  and  NSCLC 
populations  were  mostly  similar  across  tumour  types.  Mainly  due  to  due  to  the  differences  in  site 
selection  and  the  natural  history  of  disease,  there  were  more  Asian  patients  (17.4%  vs  1.2%)  and 
more subjects with ECOG PS 1 (65.5% vs 34.5) in the NSCLC studies compared to melanoma studies.

Adverse events 
The primary analysis population for safety across clinical studies includes all patients who received at 
least one dose of pembrolizumab (APaT population). 
In the pivotal NSCLC study P010, despite the longer exposure duration to pembrolizumab, overall AE 
counts  were  similar  across  all  three  arms.  However,  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  fewer  drug-related 
AEs,  drug-related  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  or  drug-related  AEs  occurred 
compared to the docetaxel arm. A slight excess of deaths due to AEs has been observed in the pooled 
pembrolizumab population compared to docetaxel arm (6.3% vs 4.9%); however, deaths due to drug-
related  adverse  events  were  less  frequently  observed  in  the  pooled  experimental  arms  than  with 
docetaxel (0.9% vs 1.6%). 
Table 58: Study P010-AEs Summary - APaT population (TPS≥1%) 
The overall incidence of AEs and SAEs was similar for NSCLC patients in the APaT population compared 
to previously reported data in melanoma patients:

Table 59: Summary of Adverse Events (PN001, PN002, PN006 and PN010) - Melanoma and Lung 
patients treated with pembrolizumab (APaT Population) 
In study P010, the most common AEs (>20%) were fatigue (25.1%), decreased appetite (24.6%) and 
dyspnea  (22.9%)  with  pembrolizumab  combined  dose  levels,  and  alopecia  (34.0%),  fatigue  (32.0%) 
and diarrhea (25.9%) in the docetaxel arm. The exposure adjusted incidence of AEs showed across all 
treatment arms a more frequent reporting in the first 3 months followed by decreased frequency with 
each  successive  3-month  period.  In  the  pembrolizumab  arms,  the  most  frequent  Grade  ≥3  AEs  were 
pneumonia  (5.3%),  dyspnea  (3.7%),  and  fatigue  (3.1%),  while  with  docetaxel  Grade  ≥3  AEs 
commonly  reported  were  neutropenia  (13.6%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (6.5%),  fatigue  (5.5%), 
febrile neutropenia (5.5%), and pneumonia (5.5%). 
In  the  overall  pembrolizumab  safety  database,  including  both  melanoma  and  NSCLC  patients,  the 
observed incidence of specific AEs occurred in ≥10% of patients is shown in the Table below.

Overall,  the  most  common  AEs  were  fatigue  (37.3%),  nausea  (24.5%),  decreased  appetite  (22.5%), 
diarrhoea (22.3%), and cough (22.0%). 
The Grade ≥3 AEs reported in NSCLC and melanoma populations are listed below:

Overall,  the  most  common  Grade  ≥3  AEs  were  anaemia  (3.2%),  dyspnoea  (2.8%),  pneumonia 
(2.6%),  fatigue  (2.5%),  and  hyponatremia  (2.2%). Consistently  with  the  natural  history  of  NSCLC,  a 
higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  dyspnoea  (3.9%  vs.  1.9%)  and  pneumonia  (4.1%  vs.  1.5%)  was 
reported in the NSCLC population compared to melanoma patients. 
Drug-related AEs 
In  the  pivotal  NSCLC  study  P010,  the  most  common  drug-related  AEs  reported  with  pembrolizumab 
(combined  arms)  were  fatigue  (13.9%),  decreased  appetite  (11.6%),  nausea  (10.0%),  and  rash 
(10.7%).  In  the  docetaxel  arm  drug-related  alopecia  (32.7%),  fatigue  (24.6%),  and  diarrhoea 
(18.1%) were more frequently observed. 
The  overall  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  in  lung  and  melanoma  populations  is  reported  in  the  Table

A  lower  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  have  been  reported  in  NSCLC  patients  compared  to  melanoma 
patients,  with  particular  regard  to  Diarrhoea,  Nausea,  Asthenia,  Fatigue,  and  events  in  the  SOCs 
Nervous System Disorders, and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
In the overall TPS≥1% population of study P010, AEOSI  were more common among pembrolizumab-
treated  compared  to  docetaxel-treated  patients  (19.5%  vs.  4.2%,  respectively).  The  median  time  to 
onset  of  the  first  AEOSI  occurrence  was  64  days  (range:  4  to  381  days)  in  pembrolizumab-treated 
patients and 85 days (range: 14 to 229 days) in docetaxel-treated patients.  
Grade ≥3 AEOSI were reported in 5.3% of pembrolizumab-treated patients. No meaningful differences 
occurred between the pembrolizumab and docetaxel arms in the rates of deaths due to AEOSI (0.4% 
vs.  0.6%),  discontinuations  due  to  AEOSI  (2.2%  vs.  1.6%),  or  discontinuations  due  to  AEOSI 
categorized as SAEs (1.5% vs. 1.0%). Fifteen patients (2.2%) discontinued pembrolizumab due to any 
AEOSI, regardless of causality, compared to 5 patients (1.6%) on docetaxel.  
The most common AEOSI, occurring in >1% of subjects in the pooled pembrolizumab arms, included 
hypothyroidism (8.2% vs 0.3%), hyperthyroidism (4.7% vs 1%) and pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.3%). 
Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, mainly Grade 1 or Grade 2 events and none worse than Grade 3, 
were  in  general  readily  managed  with  thyroid  replacement  therapy,  treatment  interruption,  or  both. 
Only one patient discontinued pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg Q3W) due to hypothyroidism.  
A total of 31 patients (4.5%) on pembrolizumab and 6 (1.9%) on docetaxel experienced pneumonitis 
in  the  pivotal  NSCLC  P010.  At  the  data  cut-off  date,  18  out  of  the  31  pembrolizumab  treated 
completely  recovered  from  pneumonitis  with  corticosteroid  treatment  and  treatment  interruption. 
Grade  ≥3  pneumonitis  was  experienced  by  14  (2.1%)  patients  compared  to  2  (0.6%)  patients  on 
docetaxel. Three pembrolizumab-treated patients died due to pneumonitis possibly drug-related.  
The incidence of selected and pre-specified AEs of potential immune aetiology was compared between 
the  pooled  pembrolizumab  arms  and  the  docetaxel  arm.  Results  reported  in  the  TPS≥1%  population 
are shown in the Table below: 
Table 64: Analysis of selected AEs - pembrolizumab groups pooled - APaT population (TPS≥1%) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 91/116 
 
  
  
 
Overall, infusion reactions were more frequent in the docetaxel arm than in the pooled pembrolizumab 
arms  (5.2%  vs.  1.8%,  respectively).  The  majority  of  cases  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  across 
treatment  arms.  The  only  two  Grade  3  reported  cases  (anaphylactic  reaction  and  drug 
hypersensitivity) occurred with pembrolizumab. 
The  number  and  rate  of  patients  with  specific  identified  AEOSI  across  clinical  studies  are  reported 
below:

Due  to  coding  issues  and  differing  database  locks,  the  following  events  for  a  small  subset  of  terms 
were not included in the above table: 
• 
Five additional cases in the AEOSI-Renal (Nephritis): autoimmune nephritis (Subject 000054 in 
Study P001), renal failure acute (Subject 000048 in Study P001), renal failure (Subject 000058 
in Study P001), renal failure acute (Subject 368852 in Study P006), and renal failure (Subject 
363218  in  Study  P006).  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Renal  (Nephritis)  in  the  pooled 
dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 9 (0.3%). 
•  Subject 001734 in KEYNOTE-001 was counted within the AEOSI-Colitis. However, it was later 
determined that the patient had a grade 3 calcified fecalith, and was included in the summary 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

of  colitis  due  to  data  entry  errors.  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Colitis  in  the  pooled 
dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 48 (1.7%). 
•  Subject 361473 in KEYNOTE-006 had an event of anaphylactoid reaction that was not counted 
as  an  infusion-related  reaction  since  this  term  was  not  listed  as  AEOSI-Infusion-Related 
Reactions at the time of reporting. This event was considered related to study drug, and led to 
treatment  withdrawal.  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Infusion-Related  Reactions  in  the 
pooled dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 71 (2.5%). 
Pneumonitis: 
Pneumonitis  occurred  in  94  (3.4%)  patients,  including  Grade  2,  3,  4  or  5  cases  in  36  (1.3%),  25 
(0.9%), 7 (0.3%) and 4 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to 
onset  of  pneumonitis  was  3.3  months  (range  2  days  to  19.3  months).  The  median  duration  was  1.5 
months  (range  1  day  to  17.2+  months).  Pneumonitis  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  36 
(1.3%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 55 patients. 
Colitis 
Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 10 (0.4%), 31 (1.1%) and 2 
(<0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of colitis was 3.5 
months (range 10 days to 16.2 months). The median duration was 1.3 months (range 1 day to 8.7+ 
months). Colitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 15 (0.5%) patients. Colitis resolved in 41 
patients. 
Hepatitis 
Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 4 (0.1%), 12 (0.4%) and 2 
(<0.1%)  patients,  respectively,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  hepatitis  was 
1.3  months  (range  8  days  to  21.4  months).  The  median  duration  was  1.8  months  (range  8  days  to 
20.9+  months).  Hepatitis  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  6  (0.2%)  patients.  Hepatitis 
resolved in 15 patients. 
Nephritis 
Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 3 (0.1%), 4 (0.1%) and 1 
(<0.1%)  patients,  respectively,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  nephritis  was 
5.1 months (range 12 days to 12.8 months). The median duration was 3.3 months (range 12 days to 
8.9+  months).  Nephritis  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  3  (0.1%)  patients.  Nephritis 
resolved in 5 patients. 
Endocrinopathies 
Hypophysitis  occurred  in  17  (0.6%)  patients,  including  Grade  2,  3  or  4  cases  in  6  (0.2%),  8  (0.3%) 
and  1  (<0.1%)  patients,  respectively,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of 
hypophysitis  was  3.7  months  (range  1  day  to  11.9  months).  The  median  duration  was  4.7  months 
(range 8+ days to 12.7+ months). Hypophysitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 4 (0.1%) 
patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 7 patients, 2 with sequelae. 
Hyperthyroidism  occurred  in  96  (3.4%)  patients,  including  Grade  2  or  3  cases  in  22  (0.8%)  and  4 
(0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hyperthyroidism 
was 1.4 months (range 1 day to 21.9 months). The median duration was 2.1 months (range 3 days to 
15.0+  months).  Hyperthyroidism  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  2  (<0.1%)  patients. 
Hyperthyroidism resolved in 71 (74%) patients. 
Hypothyroidism  occurred  in  237  (8.5%)  patients,  including  Grade  2  or  3  cases  in  174  (6.2%)  and  3

(0.1%)  patients,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  hypothyroidism  was  3.5 
months (range 1 day to 18.9 months). The median duration was not reached (range 2 days to 27.7+ 
months).  One  patient  (<  0.1%)  discontinued  pembrolizumab  due  to  hypothyroidism.  Hypothyroidism 
resolved in 48 (20%) patients.

Table made by the CHMP Assessor. Source: Table 14.4.2-63 and Table 14.4.2-71 
Among pembrolizumab-treated patients, the most common drug-related SAE was pneumonitis (2.2%), 
with  all  other  drug-related  SAEs  occurred  in  less  than  1%  of  patients.  By  contrast,  in  the  docetaxel 
arm, the most frequent drug-related SAEs were febrile neutropenia (3.2%). 
Overall,  no  major  differences  were  registered  based  on  pembrolizumab  dose  or  PD-L1  expression  in 
the pivotal NSCLC trial P010.  
In  the  NSCLC  population,  the  incidence  of  both  All-Causality  and  Drug-related  SAEs  was  consistent 
with  that  reported  in  melanoma  studies.  As  expected,  a  higher  rate  of  drug-related  Pneumonitis  was 
reported in NSCLC patients (2.4% vs 1.0%):

Laboratory findings 
In  study  P010,  a  shift  analysis  on  laboratory  abnormalities  with  the  highest  CTCAE  Grade  was 
performed. A clinically meaningful worsening in CTCAE grade, defined as a shift from less than Grade 3 
to Grade ≥3 or a shift from Grade 0 to Grade 2, was reported for some laboratory test:

No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  worsening  of  laboratory 
abnormalities was observed between the previously reported data in subjects with melanoma and the 
new data in subjects with NSCLC. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety was assessed in subgroups defined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors (age, gender, ECOG status, 
region  and  histology)  in  NSCLC  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  KEYNOTE-001  and 
KEYNOTE-010 studies. 
Age 
In  Study  P010  the  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  and  SAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  patients  ≥65  years 
compared to those aged <65 years in both docetaxel and pembrolizumab arms. 
In the NSCLC population treated with pembrolizumab (Studies P001 and P010), the incidences of AEs, 
drug-related AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, deaths, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs were slightly increased 
in older patients.

with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W 
Gender 
In Study P010, the overall incidence of AEs was similar between the genders in both treatment arms, 
with the exception of SAEs occurring more often in males than in females (38.7% vs 28% in docetaxel 
arm;  40.6%  vs  28.9%  in  pooled  pembrolizumab  arms).  A  similar  trend  was  observed  in  the  NSCLC 
population  (studies  P001  and  P010)  with  a  slightly  lower  incidence  of  SAEs  in  female  patients 
pembrolizumab treated. 
ECOG Performance Status 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  ECOG  1  than  in  the  ECOG  0  populations  in  both  the 
docetaxel (36.7% vs 30.4%) and the pembrolizumab arms (38.4% vs 31.6%) in study P010. In ECOG 
1  NSCLC  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  across  studies  P001  and  P010  the  tolerability  was 
slightly  reduced  compared  to  that  in  ECOG  0  patients  in  terms  of  SAEs  (  40.5%  vs  34.4%), 
discontinuation due to AEs (12.6% vs 8.8%) and discontinuation due to SAEs (10.2% vs 6.9%). 
Region 
NSCLC  patients  from  North  America,  Europe,  Asia  and  Australia  participated  in  the  studies.  No  major 
differences  in  safety  were  observed  by  Region  (US  and  outside  of  US)  both  in  study  P010  among 
treatment arms and in the overall NSCLC population.

Histology 
Table 73: Adverse Event Summary by Histology - All Subjects with NSCLC by dose (All Subject as 
Treated) 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study P010, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in the docetaxel arm 
(13.6%)  compared  to  the  pooled  pembrolizumab  arms  (7.9%),  with  consistent  results  besides  the 
degree  of  PD-L1  expression.  Treatment  discontinuation  was  slightly  more  frequent  in  the 
pembrolizumab arms due to events in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (2.9% 
vs 2.6%). 
Due to AEs, the treatment was interrupted in 23.6% of patients in the docetaxel arm and in 22.9% in 
the  pembrolizumab  combined  arms.  The  more  frequently  reported  events  leading  to  pembrolizumab 
interruption were in the SOCs Infection and Infestations (5.3%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (3.7%) and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (3.4%). In the docetaxel arm, treatment was 
more  commonly  interrupted  due  to  AEs  in  the  SOCs  Infection  and  Infestations  (7.4%),    General 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (5.8%)  and  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders  (4.2%). 
No major differences were observed in AEs leading to discontinuation or interruption regardless of PD-
L1 expression level. 
The incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs reported in the NSCLC population (11.3%) was 
consistent  with  that  previously  reported  in  melanoma  patients  (12.4%).  This  was  also  observed  in 
terms  of  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuations  (4.6%  in  NSCLC  and  5.7%  in 
melanoma populations). 
Overall,  across  populations  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  mostly  occurred  due  to  Pneumonitis  (34 
events, 1.2%).

reported 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201509).  No  new  safety  concerns  have  been identified  from the  review 
of spontaneously reported cases for Keytruda as of 03-Sep-2015. 
After  the  reporting  period,  1  patient  treated  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  phase  III  melanoma  study 
P006 experienced Grade 4 Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) that was considered an Important Identified 
Risk and was added in the SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8 (Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002 adopted 
by the CHMP on 1 April 2016). 
Pooled Data Across Indications to Support the Product Information 
Safety  data  to  support  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  were  pooled  across  completed  studies  in  multiple 
indications  (studies  P001  and  P010  in  NSCLC  and  studies  P001,  P002  and  P006  in  melanoma)  using 
the pembrolizumab intended dose and regimen (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks).  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The pembrolizumab safety profile in NSCLC is based on data from 1232 patients treated in the pivotal 
phase II/III study (KEYNOTE-010, P010) and in the supportive phase I trial (KEYNOTE-001, P001). The 
majority of  patients  were previously  treated  with  systemic therapy  for locally advanced  or  metastatic 
NSCLC, with the exception of 101 patients in study P001 (Cohort F2) that were treatment-naïve.  
A  twice  longer  mean  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  than  to  docetaxel  was  registered  in  Study  P010 
(153.27  vs  81.6  days,  respectively).  In  comparison  to  data  in  the  melanoma  population,  the  drug 
exposure  and  duration  of  exposure  were  lower  in  the  NSCLC  population.  However,  long  term  safety 
data (≥12 months) are available for 165 NSCLC patients. 
No  major  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  were  observed  across  NSCLC  and  melanoma  patient 
populations,  with  the  exception  that  there  were  more  Asian  patients  (17.4%  vs  1.2%)  and  more 
subjects with ECOG PS 1 (65.5% vs 34.5) in the NSCLC studies, due to the differences in site selection 
and the natural history of disease, compared to melanoma studies. 
Overall,  in  the  pivotal  study  P010  a  lower  rate  of  AEs,  in  particular  drug-related  and  drug-related 
Grade  ≥3,  and  treatment  discontinuation  occurred  in  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  compared 
to docetaxel.  
No  meaningful  differences  occurred  in  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab-treated  patients  based  on 
dose or level of PD-L1 expression in Study P010. However, in weakly PD-L1 positive patients, a higher 
rate of drug-related SAEs in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC was registered in 
the two pembrolizumab arms (3.5% and 2.1% at dose 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared 
to docetaxel (1.1%), mainly in terms of Pneumonitis (8 total cases with pembrolizumab vs one case in 
the control arm).  
Pembrolizumab  and  docetaxel  were  characterized  by  a  well  different  safety  profile.  The  most 
commonly  reported  AEs  belonging  respectively  to  SOCs  General  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions  (Fatigue,  25.1%),  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (Decreased  Appetite,  24.6%), 
Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (Dyspnoea,  22.9%)  and  to  SOCs  Skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (Alopecia,  34%),  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions 
(Fatigue, 32%), Gastrointestinal disorders (Diarrhoea, 25.9%). In terms of drug-related AEs, the most 
frequently  reported  were  Fatigue  (13.9%),  Decreased  appetite  (11.6%),  Nausea  (10.0%),  and  Rash 
(10.7%)  with  pembrolizumab,  while  in  the  docetaxel  arm  drug-related  Alopecia  (32.7%),  Fatigue 
(24.6%),  and  Diarrhoea  (18.1%)  were  more  commonly  observed.  As  expected,  a  higher  incidence  of 
AEOSI,  including  immune-mediated  AEs,  was  registered  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  compared  to 
docetaxel (19.5% vs 4.2%), and the most frequently reported events were Hypothyroidism (8.2% vs 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/546566/2016 
Page 104/116 
 
  
  
0.3%), Hyperthyroidism (4.7% vs 1%) and Pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.3%). In addition, AEOSI occurred 
earlier  with  pembrolizumab  than  docetaxel,  with  a  median  time  to  first  episode  onset  of  64  days 
(range:  4  to  381  days)  and  85  days  (range:  14  to 229  days),  respectively.  The  most  common  drug-
related  SAEs  were  Pneumonitis  (2.2%)  with  pembrolizumab  and  Febrile  neutropenia  (3.2%)  with 
docetaxel. Overall, 43 deaths due to AEs were observed in the pembrolizumab arms (17 in the 2m/kg 
Q3W,  and  26  in  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W)  vs  15  in  the  docetaxel  arm.  However,  only  6  deaths  (3  in  each 
pembrolizumab  arm)  were  considered  drug-related  in  the  experimental  arms  vs  5  in  the  docetaxel 
arm.  For  5  of  the  6  cases,  the  event  leading  to  the  fatal  outcome  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  was 
related to respiratory function (3 Pneumonitis and 2 Pneumonia). The information on the possible fatal 
outcome  of  Pneumonitis  has  been  added  to  the  Keytruda  SmPC  (Section  4.4)  through  Keytruda 
variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002. 
In  the  overall  pembrolizumab  database,  a  mostly  overlapping  safety  profile  was  observed  across 
melanoma and NSCLC populations. Overall, the occurrence of Adverse Events in the NSCLC population 
was quite similar to that in melanoma patients. In NSCLC patients the most common AEs were Fatigue 
(30.4%),  Decreased  Appetite  (25.2%),  Dyspnoea  (23.2%),  Cough  (20.8%)  and  Nausea  (20  %).  An 
increased  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  events  in  the  SOC  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders 
occurred  in  NSCLC  (Dyspnoea  3.9%,  Pneumonia  4.1%)  compared  to  melanoma  patients  (Dyspnoea 
1.9%,  Pneumonia  1.5%).  The  slightly  lower  incidence  of  drug-related  events  can  be  justified  by  the 
reduced  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  in  NSCLC  patients  compared  to  melanoma  patients.  No  major 
differences  in  the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  Drug-Related  AEs  were  observed  between  NSCLC  and 
melanoma  patients  with  the  exception  of  events  in  the  SOC  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal 
disorders (2.5% vs 1.3%). 
The rates of AEOSI were consistent across patient populations, except for Pneumonitis occurring more 
frequently  in  NSCLC  (4.4%  vs  2.6%).  In  terms  of  drug-related  SAEs,  no  major  differences  were 
reported  among  melanoma  and  NSCLC  population,  with  the  only  exception  of  a  higher  rate  of 
Pneumonitis in NSCLC patients (2.4% vs 1.0%): 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in deaths was slightly higher in NSCLC patients compared to that 
previously  reported  in  melanoma  (5.0%  vs  3.1%),  with  in  particular  an  increased  number  of 
respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure).  
The  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  treatment  was  slightly  reduced  in  NSCLC  patients  ≥65  years  and 
with ECOG PS 1.  Available data do not allow to clearly differentiate the pembrolizumab safety profile 
based on histology. No new safety concerns were raised by post-marketing data. 
Due to insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship with pembrolizumab, the MAH proposes to 
remove  the  terms  Optic  Neuritis  and  Rhabdomyolysis  from  the  list  of  Other  immune-related  adverse 
reactions in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In the pooled locked datasets of studies P001, P002, P006, and 
P010,  one  drug-related  AE  of  optic  neuritis  and  one  drug-related  AE  of  rhabdomyolysis  were 
registered. 
The  only  drug-related  AE  of  optic  neuritis  (Grade  2)  occurred  in  a  patient  with  a  known  history  of 
sarcoidosis for whom the ophthalmologist raised the possible role of sarcoidosis in the aetiology of the 
event.  The  drug-related  AE  of  rhabdomyolysis  (Grade  3)  was  reported  in  a  patient  with  a  history  of 
hypothyroidism and who was engaged in an intense physical workout a few days prior to development 
of  the  event.  The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  deletion  of  both  Optic  Neuritis  and  Rhabdomyolysis  from 
section 4.4 of the SmPC 
There  was  no  evidence  of  an  altered  safety  profile  with  anti-pembrolizumab  binding  antibody 
development.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on submitted data, no new pembrolizumab safety concerns arise from the NSCLC population. In 
comparison to data related to melanoma patients, an increased frequency of drug-related Pneumonitis 
and respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure) was reported. The 
information on the possible fatal outcome of Pneumonitis has been reflected in the Keytruda SmPC 
(Section 4.4) in the context of variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  benefit  of  Keytruda  in  the  treatment  of  second  line  or  greater  advanced  NSCLC  with  PD-L1 
expression  is  based  on  data  from  the  pivotal  phase  II/III  trial  KEYNOTE-010  (P010),  and  supportive 
data from the NSCLC Cohorts C and F of the phase I study KEYNOTE-001 (P001). 
In the pivotal trial, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS has been observed 
for both pembrolizumab arms over docetaxel in subjects with TPS≥50% (HR of 0.54, p=0.00024, and 
0.50, p=0.00002, for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively), and in 
the  overall  population  of  subjects  with  TPS≥1%  (HR  of  0.71,  p=0.00076,  and  0.61,  p<0.00001,  for 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively).  
A  statistically  significant  difference  has  been  observed  for  PFS  in  the  strongly  positive  subgroup  only 
(as per the CTA test used), with HRs of 0.58 and 0.59 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg vs 
docetaxel, respectively. 
Supportive pre-specified sensitivity analyses for PFS were provided, all of which support the results of 
the primary analysis.  
OS results observed in the overall population are clearly driven by the effect observed in the strongly 
positive  subgroup.  However,  the  visual  inspection  of  OS  survival  curves  of  the  weakly  positive 
subgroup  (for  which  a  formal  analysis  was  not  planned)  shows  a  separation  of  the  curves  over  time 
with a trend to an increase in the difference in the rate of alive patients between the experimental and

the control arms at subsequent time points.  
The  duration  of  response  observed  with  pembrolizumab  is  much  longer  than  what  observed  with 
docetaxel for all patients whose tumours express PD-L1. 
Duration of response based on IRC assessment was almost double in pembrolizumab treated subjects 
compared to docetaxel even in the weakly positive subgroup (46 and 45 weeks in the 2 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg arms, respectively, vs 26 weeks in the docetaxel arm). 
No meaningful difference has been observed between the two pembrolizumab dose levels for both OS 
and PFS. In general, secondary endpoints confirmed the benefit of pembrolizumab over docetaxel, with 
no difference observed between the two pembrolizumab dose levels. The lack of meaningful difference 
between the two pembrolizumab dose levels observed in all the efficacy analyses including Quality of 
life data further supports the adequacy of the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose level. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Results from subgroup analyses raise concerns on the effect of pembrolizumab in EGFR mutant (in all 
stratum),  East  Asian  patients  and  never  smokers.  The  information  on  the  reduced  survival  benefit  of 
pembrolizumab  compared to docetaxel in  patients  who  were  never-smokers or  patients  with  tumours 
harbouring  EGFR  activating  mutations  who  received  at  least  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and  a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor is reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  NSCLC  population  was  quite  similar  to  that  in 
melanoma patients, although it should be noted the drug exposure is reduced compared to melanoma 
patients.  In  NSCLC  patients  the  most  common  AEs  were  Fatigue  (30.4%),  Decreased  Appetite 
(25.2%),  Dyspnoea  (23.2%),  Cough  (20.8%)  and  Nausea  (20  %).  An  increased  frequency  of  drug-
related Pneumonitis and respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure), some 
of which resulting in deaths, was reported. However, the information on the possible fatal outcome of 
Pneumonitis  has  been  added  to  the  Keytruda  SmPC  (Section  4.4)  in  the  context  of  variation 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002 (positive CHMP opinion adopted on 1 April 2016).

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  resulted  in  a  clinically  significant  benefit  in  OS  compared  to  standard 
therapy  with  docetaxel  in  adult  patients  with  advanced  PD-L1-positive  NSCLC  who  were  on  disease 
progression  or  after  prior  chemotherapy.  The  superiority  of  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  over 
docetaxel  was  further  supported  by  PFS,  ORR  and  response  duration  results,  even  though  PFS  was 
statistically  significant  in  the  >50%  PD-L1  positive  stratum  only.  Indeed,  although  the  OS  results 
observed in the overall population are clearly driven by the effect observed in the strongly positive PD-
L1  subgroup,  exploratory  analyses,  in  the  weakly  positive  subgroup,  indicated  a  trend  to  a  time-
dependent  increase  in  the  difference  in  survival  rates  favouring  pembrolizumab  over  docetaxel,  and 
albeit the Kaplan Meier analysis of PFS did not show any benefit for pembrolizumab over docetaxel, the 
duration  of  response  observed  with  pembrolizumab  was  much  longer  than  what  observed  with 
docetaxel.  The  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  treatment  is  thus  not  considered  limited  to  only  the  NSCLC 
patient population expressing high levels of PD-1.  
The  safety  profile  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  does  not  differ  significantly  from  what  already

known  in  the  advanced  melanoma  setting  and  overall  seems  to  compare  favourably  to  that  of 
docetaxel. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The observed clinically relevant survival benefit obtained with pembrolizumab treatment compared to 
standard  therapy  with  docetaxel,  and  the  favourable  safety  profile outweigh  the  risks,  hence  the  B/R 
balance  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  second-line  or  greater  treatment  of  PD-L1  positive  NSCLC  is 
considered positive.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The  benefit  of  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  compared  to  standard  therapy  with  docetaxel  in  the 
second line of PD-L1 positive NSCLC is clearly evident in terms of OS, PFS and ORRs. The safety profile 
in  the  new  indication  almost  overlaps  with  that  already  known  for  the  melanoma  indication  and 
favourably compares with that of docetaxel. 
There  are  no  meaningful  differences  among  the  two  pembrolizumab  doses,  supporting  the  proposed 
2mg/kg Q3W dose, already recommended in the melanoma indication. Further support comes from the 
observation  that  statistical  significance  for  PROs  was  achieved  for  the  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  dose 
only.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, 
specifically: 
Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in NSCLC patients, durable responses have been 
observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy 
should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1 
obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024, and P042): 
•  Data on the Nanostring RNA gene signature 
• 
IHC staining for PD-L2  
•  Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling

diabetes mellitus in adolescents and children aged 1 
year and above, based on final results from study 
I8B-MC-ITSB; this is a pivotal Phase 3 study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Lyumjev compared to Humalog in combination with

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement update minor editorial and

The information regarding infusion site reactions in the 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order 
to update clinical information based on final results 
from study Study I8B-MC-ITRO (PRONTO-Pump-2); 
this is a Phase 3 prospective, randomized, double-
blind trial, which compared Lyumjev to Humalog in 
adults with Type 1 Diabetes using continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The MAH also provides a phase 
2 study evaluating Lyumjev in a Medtronic Pump 
(Study I8B-MC-ITSM) as a grouped variation. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
SmPC and PL was updated in SmPC 4.8. The update in 
SmPC 5.1on efficacy of Lyumjev in study ITRO (aka 
PRONTO-Pump-2) reflects the non-inferiority of Lyumjev in 
overall glycaemic control and superiority in control of 
postprandial glucose excursions compared with Humalog, 
also when used as CSII.

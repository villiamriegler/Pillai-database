Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that FLU D-PAN H5N1-013 is a part of a clinical development program and is included 
in the current Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) of both products (EMEA-000160-PIP01-07-M02).

Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted an annex report for: FLU D-PAN H5N1-013 
2. 
Clinical study 
The study FLU D-PAN H5N1-013 was a phase II, non-randomized, open-label to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of the adjuvanted (pre-) pandemic H5N1 influenza candidate vaccine following a 
heterologous prime-boost schedule (six months apart) in children aged 6 to 35 months. The study was 
conducted in 4 centres in Australia and 2 in Singapore.  
Methods 
  Objective(s) pertaining to annex report 
Secondary: 
- To assess the HI response against A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 virus) and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 
(H5N1 virus) strains in terms of seropositivity rates, geometric mean titers (GMTs), seroconversion 
rates (SCRs), seroprotection rates (SPRs) and mean geometric increases (MGIs) on Day 364. 
- To further describe the humoral immune responses in terms of the three age strata used for 
enrolment in this study.

To describe, in all subjects, the H5N1 neutralizing antibody responses against A/Indonesia/05/2005 
(H5N1 virus) and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1 virus) strains on Day 0, Day 42*, Day 182, Day 
192 and Day 364. 
*Only for the A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 virus) strain 
- To evaluate medically-attended AEs (MAEs), potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs), and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) during the entire study. 
Tertiary: 
- To describe anti-NA antibody response in a subset of subjects in order to further characterize the 
immune response. 
  Study design 
This is a phase II, non-randomized, open, study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 
heterologous prime-boost schedule of the H5N1 candidate vaccine adjuvanted with AS03B 
administered to children 6 to 35 months of age. To note, the age stratification ratio of 2:1:1 for 
children 6-11 months, 12-23 months and 24-35 months of age, respectively was not maintained due to 
recruitment difficulties in the younger age range (6-11 months). 
Blood samples were collected on Day 0, Day 42, Day 182, Day 192 and Day 364. 
  Study population / Vaccination schedule 
Healthy male or female children 6-35 months of age inclusive at the time of the first study vaccination 
for whom the investigator believed that their parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) would 
comply with the requirements of the protocol.  
The total duration of the study for each vaccinated subject was 12 months. 
  Statistical Methods 
The analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. As 
the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was more 
than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated cohort (TVc) was performed to complement 
the ATP analysis. 
- For the humoral immune response in terms of H5N1 HI antibodies against A/Indonesia/05/2005 
(H5N1 virus) and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1 virus) strains, GMTs, seropositivity rates, SCRs, 
SPRs, MGIs, Booster SCRs and BFs were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at specified 
blood sampling time points, overall and by age stratum. 
- For the humoral immune response in terms of serum neutralizing antibodies against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 virus) and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1 virus) strains, GMTs,

seropositivity rates, VRRs and Booster VRRs were calculated with their 95% CIs at specified blood 
sampling time points, overall and by age stratum. 
- For the humoral immune response in terms of serum neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodies against 
A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 virus) strains (in a subset of subjects), GMTs and seropositivity rates 
were calculated with their 95% CIs at specified blood sampling time points, overall and by age 
stratum. 
Results 
  Study population (total vaccinated cohort) 
 
Immunogenicity results 
The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the total 
vaccinated cohort. 
- The adjuvanted (pre-) pandemic H5N1 influenza candidate vaccine induced a humoral immune 
response in terms of H5N1 HI antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against A/Indonesia/5/2005 and 
A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1virus) strains that persisted to Day 364. 
- All three CHMP criteria were met at Day 364. 
- Antibody persistence in terms of GMT against A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 
(H5N1 virus) strains for HI tended to be higher for subjects 6 < 12 months of age. 
- All subjects from the subset were seropositive or had anti-NA antibodies against A/Indonesia/5/2005 
(H5N1 virus) strain at Day 364.

Safety results 
The analysis of safety was performed on the total vaccinated cohort. 
- Up to the Day 364 visit, MAEs were reported for 63.0% of subjects 6 < 12 months of age, for 55.9% 
of subjects 12 < 24 months of age and for 60.2% of subjects 24 < 36 months of age. The most 
frequently reported events were upper respiratory tract infections (23.0%), cough (17.7%), rhinorrhea 
(10.6%), pyrexia (7.1%) and nasopharyngitis (7.1%). 
Serious adverse events: 
From Day 0 up to the Day 364 visit, SAEs were reported for five (10.9%) subjects 6 < 12 months of 
age and for four (11.8%) subjects 12 < 24 months of age. None of the SAEs reported was considered 
causally related to the study vaccine in the opinion of the investigator. There were no fatal SAEs. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events: 
- No (S)AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine were reported in this study from 
Day 0 up to the Day 364 visit.

Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The Annex report (Day 364) did not reveal new safety issues. 
These results suggest that a lower antigen content (1.9 μg HA) combined with ASO3B can induce an 
efficient homologous & heterologous immune response in terms of HI antibodies in children aged 6 to 
35 months . It is reassuring that all CHMP criteria were met consistently in all age strata in relation to 
both homologous and heterologous strains. In the absence of significant new data on vaccine 
effectiveness or new safety concerns following vaccination, there is no need for update of the product 
information. 
In accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence 
the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do not require further 
regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for the above mentioned product. 
  Fulfilled  
No further action required

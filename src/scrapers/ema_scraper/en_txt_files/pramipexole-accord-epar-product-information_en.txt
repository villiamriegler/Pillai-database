Parkinson’s disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of 
the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and 
fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “on off” fluctuations).

Initial treatment 
Doses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per 
day and then increased every 5-7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable 
effects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect. 
If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg 
of salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. 
However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg 
(of salt) per day (see section 4.8).

Maintenance treatment 
The individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a 
maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, 
efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose 
adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of 
salt). In advanced Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) 
per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is 
recommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the 
maintenance treatment with Pramipexole Accord, depending on reactions in individual patients (see 
section 4.5). 
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing 
frequency. 
Renal impairment 
The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is 
suggested for initiation of therapy: 
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min, the daily dose of Pramipexole Accord 
should be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily. A 
maximum daily dose of 1.1 mg pramipexole base (1.5 mg of salt) should not be exceeded. 
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/min, the initial daily dose of 
Pramipexole Accord should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 
mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/0.25 mg of salt daily). A maximum daily dose of 1.57 mg 
pramipexole base (2.25 mg of salt) should not be exceeded. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) 
per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose 
should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy the Pramipexole Accord daily dose should be 
reduced by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i.e. if creatinine clearance 
declines by 30%, then the Pramipexole Accord daily dose should be reduced by 30%. The daily dose 
can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/min and as a 
single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min. 
Paediatric population 
Pramipexole Accord is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years since the 
efficacy and safety has not been established in this population. Pramipexole Accord should not be 
used in children or adolescents with Tourette Disorder because of a negative benefit-risk balance for 
this disorder (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Pramipexole Accord in children below 18 years has not been established. 
There is no relevant use of Pramipexole Accord in the paediatric population for the children of 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of 
absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic 
insufficiency on Pramipexole Accord pharmacokinetics has not been investigated. 
Tourette Disorder 
Method of administration 
The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without 
food.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Dystonia  
Dyskinesia 
Hallucinations 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When prescribing Pramipexole Accord in a patient with Parkinson’s disease with renal impairment a 
reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2. 
Hallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients 
should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur. 
In advanced Parkinson’s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur 
during the initial titration of Pramipexole Accord. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be 
decreased. 
Axial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has 
occasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease following initiation or incremental 
dose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease, the 
symptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia 
occurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of 
pramipexole considered. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without 
awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and 
advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Pramipexole 
Accord. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must 
refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of 
therapy may be considered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when 
patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see 
sections 4.5, 4.7 and section 4.8). 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge 
eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including 
Pramipexole Accord. Dose reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms 
develop. 
Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence 
Impulse control disorders 
Mania and delirium 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers 
should be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose 
reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.

Patients with psychotic disorders 
Ophthalmologic monitoring 
Severe cardiovascular disease 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential 
benefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole 
should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. 
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal 
of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2). 
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood 
pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension 
associated with dopaminergic therapy. 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
To discontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see 
section 4.2). Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists 
including pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain 
which may be severe. Patients should be informed about this before tapering the dopamine agonist, 
and monitored regularly thereafter. In case of persistent symptoms, it may be necessary to increase the 
pramipexole dose temporarily (see section 4.8).

Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication  with dopaminergic medicinal 
products can result in augmentation. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the 
evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other 
extremities. Augmentation was specifically investigated in a controlled clinical trial over 26 weeks. 
Augmentation was observed in 11.8% of patients in the pramipexole group (N = 152) and 9.4% of 
patients in the placebo group (N = 149). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to augmentation showed no 
significant difference between pramipexole and placebo groups. 
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is 
seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or 
elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by 
biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with 
anticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and 
levodopa.

Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway 
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by 
inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal 
products that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, 
such as cimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interact with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the 
pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered 
concomitantly with Pramipexole Accord. 
Combination with levodopa 
Pregnancy 
Breastfeeding 
Antipsychotic medicinal products 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see 
section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected. 
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other 
sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 
4.8). 
When Pramipexole Accord is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of 
levodopa is reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while 
increasing the dose of Pramipexole Accord. 
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). 
Pramipexole Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. 
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the 
concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma. 
In the absence of human data, Pramipexole Accord should not be used during breast-feeding. 
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
Patients being treated with Pramipexole Accord and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep 
episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness 
may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such 
recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole 
affected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, 
these studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility. 
Pramipexole Accord has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on 
pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups. 63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse 
drug reaction. 
The majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even 
as therapy is continued. 
Parkinson’s disease, most common adverse reactions 
Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of 
patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very 
rare (< 1/10,000) ; not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
The most commonly (≥ 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson’s disease more 
frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, 
dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of 
somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A 
more frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may 
occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.

Impulse control disorders 
Cardiac failure 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, , compulsive spending or buying, binge 
eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including 
Pramipexole Accord. (see section 4.4). 
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome 
Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including 
pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section 
4.4). 
In clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with 
pramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased 
risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-
2.85). 
In a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson’s 
disease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had 
symptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include 
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour 
(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included 
dopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age ( ≤ 65 years), not 
being married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.

There is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those 
related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, 
hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose 
of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent 
may be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with 
gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram 
monitoring. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

Mechanism of action 
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily 
of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic 
activity.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the 
striatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and 
turnover. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Paediatric population 
Clinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson’s disease 
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.  
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Placebo-
controlled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – V treated 
with pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received 
concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications. 
In early and advanced Parkinson’s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was 
maintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years 
there were no signs of decreasing efficacy. 
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole 
significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to 
initial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be 
balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean 
change in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally 
higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant 
difference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating 
pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

The efficacy of pramipexole (0.0625-0.5 mg/day) with paediatric patients aged 6-17 years with 
Tourette Disorder was evaluated in a 6-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled flexible 
dose study. A total of 63 patients were randomised (43 on pramipexole, 20 on placebo). The primary 
endpoint was change from baseline on the Total Tic Score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity 
Scale (YGTSS). No difference was observed for pramipexole as compared to placebo for either the 
primary endpoint or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints including YGTSS total score, Patient 
Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), or 
Clinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S). Adverse events occurring in at least 5% of 
patients in the pramipexole group and more common in the pramipexole-treated patients than in 
patients on placebo were: headache (27.9%, placebo 25.0%), somnolence (7.0%, placebo 5.0%), 
nausea (18.6%, placebo 10.0%), vomiting (11.6%, placebo 0.0%), upper abdominal pain (7.0%, 
placebo 5.0%), orthostatic hypotension (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), myalgia (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), sleep 
disorder (7.0%, placebo 0.0%), dyspnoea (7.0%, placebo 0.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(7.0%, placebo 5.0%). Other significant adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication 
for patients receiving pramipexole were confusional state, speech disorder and aggravated condition 
(see section 4.2). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pramipexole Accord in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson’s Disease (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
Clinical efficacy and safety in Tourette Disorder 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute 
bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 
hours. Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but 
the rate of absorption was reduced. Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient 
variation of plasma levels. 
Elimination 
Distribution 
Biotransformation 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent. 
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is 
large (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to 
plasma). 
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving 
the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole. 
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of 
14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total 
clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately 400 
ml/min. The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.

Pramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell 
hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is 
not clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and 
higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not 
observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species 
investigated. 
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and 
rabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at 
maternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, 
the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated. 
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency 
to a hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey. 
A delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. 
The relevance for humans is unknown.

pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change your 
medication.

Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary of risk management plan for Pedmarqsi <sodium thiosulfate> 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Pedmarqsi. The RMP details important 
risks of Pedmarqsi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Pedmarqsi's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pedmarqsi's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Pedmarqsi should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Pedmarqsi should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all  which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Pedmarqsi's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Pedmarqsi is  autho rised  for the  prevention  of  ototoxicity  induced  by  cisplatin  chemotherapy  in 
patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with localized, non-metastatic, solid tumours (see SmPC for 
the  full  indication).  It  contains  sodium  thiosulfate  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by 
intravenous 15-minute infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Pedmarqsi’s benefits can be found in Pedmarqsi’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pedmarqsi. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to
minimise or further characterise the risks
Important  risks  of  Pedmarqsi,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Pedmarqsi's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Pedmarqsi is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Pedmarqsi  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Pedmarqsi.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

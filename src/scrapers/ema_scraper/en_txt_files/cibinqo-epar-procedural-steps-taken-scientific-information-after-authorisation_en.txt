are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
II and PL 
Cibinqo (abrocitinib) EMEA/H-A20/1517/C/005452/0003 
28 January 2022 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency further to the safety issues on 
MACE, VTE, serious infections, malignancy and 
mortality for all JAK inhibitors used in the treatment 
of inflammatory disorders. The CHMP was requested 
to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk 
balance of Cibinqo, Jyseleca, Olumiant, Rinvoq and 
Xeljanz and to give its recommendation whether the 
marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion was adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee.

SmPC 
SmPC section 5.1 has been revised to update the long-term 
long-term efficacy data based on the results from 
studies B7451012, B7451013, B7451015 and 
B7451029.

efficacy data. Efficacy data through Week 96 of cumulative 
treatment demonstrated that most initial responders 
maintained their response through Week 96. The response 
to abrocitinib treatment decreased slightly over time 
through Week 48 among subjects who achieved initial 
response at Week 12. However, there was no clinically 
meaningful decrease in IGA, EASI-75, or PP-NRS4 response 
rate between Week 48 and Week 96. Efficacy data through 
96 weeks of cumulative treatment continue to support the 
long-term efficacy of both abrocitinib 100 mg QD and 200

mg QD in the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-

The effect of abrocitinib on CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C19 
results from Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) study 
B7451092. This is a Phase I, open-label, fixed-
sequence, 2-period study to estimate the effect of 
multiple dose abrocitinib on the pharmacokinetics of 
single doses of caffeine, efavirenz, and omeprazole in 
healthy participants.

enzymes was assessed in vivo. Abrocitinib is a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP2C19 enzyme; caution should thus be 
exercised when using abrocitinib concomitantly with narrow 
therapeutic index medicines that are primarily metabolised 
by CYP2C19. Further, abrocitinib is also a mild inhibitor of 
CYP1A2 enzyme, nevertheless no general dose adjustment 
can be recommended.

(April 2021 data cut) from the ongoing long-term 
extension study B7451015.The RMP version v1.0 has 
also been submitted. In addition, MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in the 
SmPC and to update the contact details of the local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

(April 2021 data cut) from the ongoing long-term extension 
study B7451015, SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
were updated. It was highlighted in SmPC section 4.4 that 
tuberculosis was observed in clinical studies with 
abrocitinib; and in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 that the rate 
of herpes zoster infections was higher in patients who were 
treated with 200 mg, with a medical history of herpes 
zoster, with a confirmed ALC < 1 × 103/mm3 prior to the 
event.

with famotidine 40 mg, an H2-receptor antagonist, 
abrocitinib active moiety exposures decreased by 
approximately 35%. The effect of elevating gastric pH with 
antacids, or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) on the 
pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib has not been studied and 
may be similar to that seen with famotidine. Therefore, the 
higher 200 mg daily dose should be considered for patients 
treated concomitantly with products which increase gastric 
pH, as they may reduce the efficacy of abrocitinib.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Intelence, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In line with published data, etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin were found to decrease by 23%, 24% and 
29%, respectively, when co-administered with boceprevir. Boceprevir AUC and Cmax increased by 
10% and Cmin decreased by 12% in this combination. Co-infections with hepatitis C virus and HIV 
are frequent. The clinical significance of reductions in etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters and 
boceprevir Cmin, especially in the setting of the combination therapy with HIV antiretroviral 
medicines, which also affect the pharmacokinetics of etravirine and/or boceprevir, is unknown. This 
warrants introduction of a corresponding warning in the SmPC of etravirine, in line with the already 
existing warning in the SmPC of boceprevir. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
In addition, minor editorial changes are made in the recommended wording on interactions with 
boceprevir, in order to improve consistency with other parts of the Product Information of Intelence. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Intelence, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance etravirine is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

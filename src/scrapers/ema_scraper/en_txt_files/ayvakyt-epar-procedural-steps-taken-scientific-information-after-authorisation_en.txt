mastocytosis (ISM) with moderate to severe 
symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic 
treatment based on results from the pivotal part of 
study BLU-285-2203 (PIONEER), this is a 3-part,

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In a clinical study investigating the effect of severe hepatic 
pharmacokinetic information for use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment based on the final results 
from study BLU-285-0107 listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP; this is a phase 1, open-label, 
single-dose study to investigate the influence of 
severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of avapritinib. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 3.1 has also been 
submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib following 
administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg avapritinib, 
the mean unbound AUC was 61% higher in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) as 
compared to matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic 
function.  
The starting dose of avapritinib should be reduced in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment from 300 mg to 
200 mg orally once daily for patients with GIST, and from

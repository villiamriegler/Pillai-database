1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Insmed Netherlands B.V. submitted on 1 July 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Arikayce, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 13 December 2018. 
Arikayce was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1259 on 8 April 2014 in the following 
condition: Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
“Arikayce is indicated for the treatment of persistent Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) lung infection 
as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in adults. Consideration should be given to official 
guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
The name Arikayce was changed to ‘Arikayce liposomal’ during the procedure. Reference to both names 
appears throughout the assessment.   
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Arikayce liposomal as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/arikayce-liposomal. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
EMEA-C3-000525-PIP01-08 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP EMEA-C3-000525-PIP01-08-M04.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. There are no medicinal products authorised in the EU for the indication

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Arikayce liposomal is proposed to be indicated for the treatment of treatment of non-tuberculous 
mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in adults with 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 9/109 
 
 
 
limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis. It will be used as part of a combination 
antibacterial drug regimen.  
At the time of this report, there are no approved medications for the NTM indication in the EU. 
Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease caused by MAC is associated with productive cough, 
shortness of breath, fatigue, lung function decline and mortality. MAC has been implicated in 
complications of debilitating lung diseases such as bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). Post-menopausal Caucasian women without apparent predisposing conditions have 
been reported with increasing frequency to have pulmonary disease associated with MAC. 
The morbidity associated with NTM lung diseases is significant and has been reported in the literature to 
have a 5-year all-cause mortality risk ranging from 5.4% to 39.7%. In retrospective studies from the 
literature, the failure to achieve negative sputum cultures in patients with MAC lung disease has been 
associated with higher mortality rates. The 5-year mortality rate in one study was 33.3% for untreated 
MAC lung disease compared to 22.2% for treated MAC lung disease in patients with definite MAC lung 
disease. In the treated group, sputum culture conversion was 53.7% compared to 0% in the untreated 
group.  
Another study evaluated the outcomes of patients with macrolide-resistant MAC lung disease and found 
that the 1-year mortality rate was 34% for patients who remained sputum culture positive compared to 
0% for patients who converted to negative. This study also showed a similar trend in the 5-year mortality 
risk for most patients who reached their 5-year follow-up (63% for patients who remained 
culture-positive compared to 23% for converters). A recent update in patients with MAC lung disease 
reported a pooled estimate of 5-year all-cause mortality of 27%, with a high variability across the pooled 
datasets, ranging from 10% to 48%. Predictors of mortality risk were male sex, presence of comorbidities 
and advanced patient age. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The prevalence of human disease attributable to NTM infections has increased over the past few decades. 
In spite of an increasing body of evidence on its epidemiology, NTM infection, unlike tuberculosis, is not 
a notifiable disease in most countries and numbers are likely to be underestimated. The incidence of NTM 
lung disease in the United States (US) doubled from 1997 to 2007 and annual prevalence increased from 
approximately 20 to 47 cases per 100,000 or 8.2% per year in US Medicare beneficiaries. At least 80% of 
diagnosed pulmonary NTM infections in the US are caused by MAC. The prevalence of NTM lung infection 
in the European Economic Area is 0.6 per 10,000 of the population. In Germany, the documented 
prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease, a non-notifiable disease, increased from 2.3 to 3.3 cases/100,000 
population from 2009 to 2014, with a strong association with advanced age and COPD. In addition, 
pulmonary M. avium intracellulare was the main driver of the rise in NTM incidence in England, Wales, and 
Northern Ireland between 2007 and 2012. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Mycobacterium avium and M. intracellulare (which belong to MAC), are the predominant infective species 
in NTM pulmonary disease worldwide. The NTM-Network European Trials Group study conducted in 62 
laboratories in 30 countries across 6 continents found MAC bacteria predominated in most countries, 
followed by M. gordonae and M. xenopi.

EMA/473660/2020  
Page 10/109 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Fatigue and loss of energy were reported as the most common symptoms by 80% of participants in an 
informal poll while 40% reported chronic cough and coughing up blood and phlegm. Less commonly, 
malaise, dyspnoea, fever, haemoptysis and weight loss can occur, usually with advanced MAC lung 
disease. Evaluation is often complicated by the symptoms of other pulmonary comorbidities. 
Pulmonary NTM infections are diagnosed based on at least 2 sputum samples positive for an NTM species 
or a single positive culture from bronchoscopy or lung biopsy and radiographic criteria for disease and 
radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis, nodules or cavities per the American Thoracic Society/Infectious 
Disease Society of America [ATS/IDSA] Statement. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are no approved treatments specifically for NTM lung disease in the EU. Treatment guidelines have 
been developed by the ATS/IDSA and the British Thoracic Society, which have since been adopted by 
various countries globally and incorporated into local guidelines. The current treatment of NTM lung 
disease is primarily with a multi-drug regimen (MDR) based on the treatment of tuberculosis. The 
recommendation for patients with MAC is a 3-drug regimen including a macrolide, ethambutol and a 
rifamycin. Treatment is often for 12 to 18 months and selected based on clinical presentation and disease 
progression but may exceed 18 months. 
Intravenous (IV) amikacin or intramuscular streptomycin are recommended for patients with 
fibrocavitary disease or severe nodular/bronchiectatic disease and/or previously treated disease. 
Aminoglycosides are limited by poor penetration into lung tissue after IV administration, poor uptake by 
alveolar macrophages and the potential for ototoxicity, loss of balance and impaired renal function with 
high or prolonged systemic exposure.  
The goal of treatment is 12 months of negative sputum cultures while on treatment. Culture conversion 
has been reported to occur in the majority of patients without fibrocavitary disease if they complete a full 
course of guideline-based treatment. However, in patients who experience treatment failure and/or have 
more severe underlying conditions such as fibrocavitary disease, culture conversion is more difficult, even 
with extended treatment, and alternative therapeutic options are limited. The ATS/IDSA guidelines 
recommend a 3 times weekly regimen of clarithromycin (1,000 mg) or azithromycin (500 mg), rifampicin 
(600 mg) and ethambutol (25 mg/kg) for most patients with nodular/bronchiectatic MAC lung disease. 
For patients with fibrocavitary MAC lung disease or severe nodular/bronchiectatic disease, a daily regimen 
of clarithromycin (500 to 1,000 mg) or azithromycin (250 mg), rifampicin (600 mg) or rifabutin (150 to 
300 mg) and ethambutol (15 mg/kg) with consideration of 3 times weekly IV amikacin or streptomycin 
early in therapy is recommended. Patients should continue treatment for 12 months after sputum culture 
conversion has been achieved. 
The recently updated British Thoracic Society guideline on the management of NTM pulmonary disease 
provides treatment recommendations similar to the ATS/IDSA guidelines for the NTM species that most 
commonly fulfil the ATS/IDSA microbiologic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease within the UK, namely 
MAC, M. kansasii, M. malmoense, M. xenopi and M. abscessus complex. The guidance is based on five 
randomised controlled studies and several non-comparative studies involving individuals (not known to 
be HIV-positive) with MAC identified in the literature. 
In 2020, while this procedure was ongoing, the ERS/ATS/IDSA/ESCMID clinical practice guideline 
recommended addition of Arikayce to treatment in patients not responding to at least 6 months of 
currently recommended treatment.

About the product 
Amikacin liposome inhalation dispersion (ALIS) is a sterile, white, milky, aqueous, liposomal nebuliser 
dispersion consisting of amikacin sulfate encapsulated in liposomes, composed of 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol. The concentration of the active ingredient is 
expressed in terms of amikacin base and is nominally 70 mg/mL. The liposomes are composed of 
phospholipids naturally occurring in lung surfactant. DPPC and cholesterol are formulated at a 2:1 weight 
ratio. The liposomal formulation was developed to provide release of drug in the lung over time, allowing 
for QD administration.  
Aspects of development 
On 4 November 2014, Insmed submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) for ALIS for the 
treatment of CF patients with chronic infection due to P. aeruginosa and for the treatment of patients with 
NTM lung infections. During the review of the MAA, a draft Similarity Assessment was received which 
suggested that ALIS and tobramycin inhalation solution (TOBI) Podhaler were similar. Accordingly, 
Insmed was requested to furnish additional information to elucidate the differences between ALIS and 
TOBI Podhaler. Insmed chose to withdraw the proposed indication of treatment of CF patients with 
chronic infection due to P. aeruginosa. Instead, Insmed continued to focus on the NTM indication. 
Accordingly, the regulatory strategy was switched to seek a Conditional Approval for the NTM indication 
supported by a single Phase 2 study (TR02-112). 
TR02-112 did not reach nominal statistical significance for the primary endpoint, which the CHMP 
considered to have unproven clinical relevance. Following an oral explanation to the CHMP, the evidence 
of efficacy and safety provided by TR02-112 was considered by the Committee to be insufficient to 
support approval and Insmed withdrew the MAA on 8 June 2016. The Phase 3 studies INS-212 and 
INS-312 were ongoing at the time of the withdrawal. This new MAA includes updates to Modules 3, 4 (new 
in-vitro and in-vivo studies in macrophages) and 5 (INS-212 and 213, with new POPPK analyses) and 
seeks only an indication for treatment of MAC.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is 
(2S)-4-amino-N-[(1R,2S,3S,4R,5S)-5-amino-2-[(2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)-4-amino-3,5-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxy
methyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy-4-[(2R,3R,4S,5R,6R)-6-(aminomethyl)-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxan-2-yl]oxy-3-hydrox
y-cyclohexyl]-2-hydroxy-butan-amide, sulfate (1:2 salt) corresponding to the molecular formula 
C22H43N5O13·2H2SO4. It has a relative molecular mass of 781.76 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR, UV, and NMR 
spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active substance were studied by XRD (X ray 
diffractometry). 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic, white or almost white powder freely soluble in water, 
practically insoluble in acetone and in ethanol (96 per cent). 
Amikacin derives from kanamycin. As the molecule of kanamycin has four primary amino groups, it is 
possible during the synthesis to obtain isomers that differ only in the position of the acyl group. Two 
isomers are known, and their contents are routinely controlled in amikacin sulfate specifications. 
Amikacin sulfate results to be a crystalline product. One polymorphic form is observed by XRD. No other 
polymorphic forms are known in literature. The active substance is in solution in the finished product, 
polymorphism is lost and therefore does not represent an issue. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The crude amikacin sulfate is synthesised in 5 main steps using three commercially available well-defined 
starting materials (kanamycin and α-hydroxy-γ-phthalimide butyric acid, and N-hydroxyphthalimide) 
with acceptable specifications. The main steps consist in esterification, silanization, acylation, hydrolysis, 
and hydrazinolysis. The synthesis of the crude active substance is followed by the synthesis of amikacin 
sulfate which consist in two steps: dissolution and discoloration, and crystallization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 13/109 
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
An adequate risk assessment has been undertaken in relation to the presence of nitrosamine-based 
impurities in the active substance according to EMA guidelines. The risk was deemed low, analysis of 19 
batches of the active substance using an appropriately validated method indicate that the related 
impurities are at very low levels (or not present) and are at least below the current interim limits (as well 
as the technical limits) set for the relevant impurities. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, sulphates, 
HPLC, TLC), pH, crystallinity (physical), loss of drying (Ph. Eur.), , specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), residue on 
ignition (USP), sulfate (titrimetry), assay (HPLC), potency (USP), related substance (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), microbial enumeration test (Ph.Eur.), total aerobic 
microbial count (Ph. Eur.), total yeasts and moulds count (Ph. Eur), and identification of amikacin sulfate 
(NIR). 
The specification for amikacin sulfate is based on the Ph. Eur. monographs for amikacin sulfate and 
general requirements in this compendium. 
The potential organic impurities that can originate from the synthesis process of the amikacin sulfate are 
those identified in the Ph. Eur. Monograph. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold 
according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications 
have been set. Elemental impurities in the active substance were evaluated using the ICH Q3D “finished 
product based” approach, and the results comply with the ICH Q3D control threshold limits. This is 
considered satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 15 batches used in nonclinical, clinical, and stability studies were provided. The 
batches of the active substance are representative of the material used in the finished product intended 
for commercialization.  
The active substance is packaged in two bags made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) which complies 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Stability 
Stability data from 10 batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, pH, crystallinity, water content, loss of 
drying, solubility, residue of ignition, transmittance, assay, related substances, residual solvents and

bacterial endotoxins. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
There are no obvious trends noted in the stability data under long term and accelerated conditions, it is 
apparent from the data provided that the active substance is very stable. The proposed retest period of 5 
years when stored in LDPE bags is acceptable 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white, milky dispersion consisting of amikacin sulfate encapsulated in liposomes. 
The finished product is delivered by the Lamira nebuliser system using eFlow technology. The device is a 
high efficiency electronic nebuliser that uses a vibrating perforated membrane to generate inhalable 
aerosol. 
The goal of pharmaceutical development was to develop a liposomal dispersion to allow for the 
achievement of greater local concentrations of amikacin in the lung, while minimising systemic 
concentrations. To effectively treat pulmonary bacterial infections, amikacin was formulated into an 
inhalation dosage form to target the infected lung directly with a product with a pharmacokinetic profile 
that would permit once-a-day dosing. This effort resulted in the development of amikacin liposome 
inhalation dispersion (ALIS), which was designed to include DPPC as the primary lipid. Liposome 
technologies have been proven to alter pharmacokinetics (and liposome and lipid-complex formulations 
have been used successfully as drug delivery systems. 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was developed and includes considerations of clinical safety 
(including once daily administration), patient compliance and quality attributes. Relevant aspects of the 
QTPP that influenced product development are provided in Table 3. The safety, efficacy, and patient 
compliance requirements were used to guide decisions about the dosage form and packaging choices. 
These requirements were also used to establish critical quality attributes (CQAs) as shown in Table 4. The 
intention of this development strategy is to have a holistic understanding of the finished product 
formulation and manufacturing process parameters, and their impact on the finished product CQAs.

Table 1: Finished Product Quality Target Product Profile 
Table 2: Critical Quality Attributes Derived from QTPP 
The solid-state characteristics of the active substance have no impact on the performance of the finished 
product since amikacin sulfate is dissolved in water as part of the finished product manufacturing process. 
Its limited solubility in ethanol contributes to the high encapsulation efficiency achieved during 
manufacture of the finished product. Because it is multi-cationic it is relatively impermeable to the 
liposome membrane and can be effectively retained within the liposomes. Compatibility of amikacin 
sulfate with the excipients was confirmed in long-term and accelerated stability studies. 
The excipients used were selected to ensure the compatibility with the lung fluids, efficient liposome 
formation, and stability of the product. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is the most abundant lipid in endogenous lung surfactant and 
studies are cited where added lipid is readily processed in the lung. It was therefore expected that 
formulations with this lipid would have a high degree of biocompatibility. Its primary degradation pathway 
is hydrolysis, which is relatively slow, especially when liposome preparations are maintained near neutral 
pH and at, or below room temperature. 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 16/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Although DPPC is known to form stable liposome structures, the bilayer membrane undergoes changes in 
physical state at discrete temperatures (35 °C and 41 °C) which is accompanied by greater leakage of 
entrapped water-soluble compounds. The inclusion of cholesterol above 20 mole percent minimises this 
temperature sensitivity. Cholesterol is also known to stabilise liposome structures that are introduced into 
biological milieu by reducing leak of entrapped contents. 
The following physicochemical properties of ALIS have been discussed during formulation development: 
• 
DPPC to Cholesterol Ratio 
DPPC to cholesterol ratio has not changed during development. The ratio was selected based on 
published literature to produce greater product stability, less rupture, and therefore less leakage. The 
DPPC to cholesterol ratio is controlled in ALIS by the manufacturing process. 
• 
Lipid to Drug (L/D) Ratio (w/w) 
L/D ratio is desired to be low to increase encapsulation efficiency, thereby increasing total amikacin and 
reducing the lipid to drug ratio.  
Potency 
The potency of ALIS (expressed as amikacin concentration) is controlled by the manufacturing process 
by in-process testing for amikacin concentration and is assured to be within specification at finished 
product release. 
•  Mean Liposome Particle Size 
ALIS was developed to target a mean liposome particle size to allow for transport of the liposomes within 
the aerosol droplets. Liposome size is determined by the manufacturing process and is controlled at 
release and during stability. 
• 
pH   
The hydrolysis of DPPC to lyso-PC is affected by pH. Therefore, the pH of ALIS was controlled, monitored 
and maintained. It is controlled in the product specifications. 
• 
Osmolality  
The ability of the liposomes to retain drug depends on the osmotic gradient across liposomal 
membranes. Therefore, osmolality is controlled at the time of manufacture of ALIS using in-process 
control of the sodium chloride process solution. Additionally, the osmolality of ALIS is further controlled 
in the finished product specifications. 
• 
Percent Associated Amikacin Post-Nebulisation  
the  percent  associated  amikacin  (entrapped  amikacin)  is  a  critical  attribute  in  assuring  a  consistent 
amount of liposomal amikacin delivered during nebulization. The nebuliser and finished product can both 
influence percent associated amikacin aerosols. The control of this attribute is achieved by controlling 
osmolality of the ALIS and the ratio of the lipids in the liposome membrane; it is also controlled in the 
finished product specification. 
A suite of tests has been utilised to characterise the finished product across a number of batches and 
processes during the pharmaceutical development: 
•  Density gradient: The profile of amikacin and total lipid in the liposomes separated on a density 
gradient demonstrated co-localisation of lipid and active substance. This represents a function of 
the internal amikacin concentration as well as the liposome size distribution, shape variation and 
the range in lamellarity of the liposomes. The data indicate a uniform population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 17/109 
 
 
 
•  Liposomal contents are characterised by a number of inter-related measures: liposomal 
volume, captured volume, and internal amikacin concentration (IAC). 
• 
In vitro release: The development of the method was based on the many considerations. The 
proposed method is based on an increase in permeability due to surfactant binding, with 
increasing concentrations over time. The in vitro release profiles of 79 batches manufactured by 
both the two proposed manufacturers along with an overall average release profile are provided. 
In vitro release is included as a release and stability test of the finished product.  
•  Visual Observation of Lamellarity by Cryo-Electron Microscopy: Ethanol infusion was 
used to make ALIS since it has been known historically that this process produces liposomes of 
a uniform size and relatively low lamellarity. The lamellarity of ALIS was assessed using 
cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) which visually shows the liposomes to be predominantly 
unilamellar and spherical. The manufacturing process was developed to achieve a robust 
manufacturing process with the consideration of the physiochemical and biological properties.  
•  Liposome Net Charge: It was confirmed by using zeta potential measurements that as 
expected the ALIS liposomes are neutral since they are comprised of neutral lipids. 
•  Liposome Phase Transition: it was shown that the incorporated cholesterol abolishes the 
DPPC phase transitions and ALIS shows no sharp phase transition and thus do not show greater 
leakage of entrapped water-soluble compounds under Differential Scanning Calorimetry from 5 
°C to 60 °C ALIS is manufactured using a process in which an aqueous amikacin sulfate solution 
is combined with an ethanolic lipid solution to form liposomes. The resulting bulk suspension is 
then aseptically filled into 10 mL vials and crimp sealed. Because of the liposomal nature and 
heat lability of the product, terminal sterilization cannot be used. Therefore, the processes of 
liposome formation and filling of ALIS are all carried out aseptically. 
There have been two different approaches used (and slight variations of those approaches) to 
manufacture clinical and non-clinical materials in the development of ALIS: 
1. 
A single stream infusion process which was used in the early phases of ALIS nonclinical and clinical 
development referenced as Processes A, A1, and A2. 
2. 
A multiple stream infusion process referenced as Processes B, B1, B2, C, D and E for non-clinical 
and later stage clinical development and commercial process development. 
To increase potency and batch size of ALIS, a multiple stream infusion process with in-line mixing was 
developed. Compared to process A2, all “B” processes and Process C increased batch size. Further 
modifications to Process B, identified as B1 and B2, were made upon transferring the process to the two 
intended commercial manufacturing sites. All materials produced from the different B processes were 
aseptically filled with different volumes as needed for clinical and nonclinical studies. Process C differs 
from Process B2 only by the incorporation of pre-sterilised (gamma irradiation) filtration tubing 
assemblies and the addition of two filters placed in series, resulting in double sterile filtration of all 
starting process solutions. The proposed commercial manufacturing process (Process D) is approximately 
a two-fold batch size increase of Process C, with certain process parameters adjusted to accommodate 
the increase in process scale. When compared to Process D, the proposed commercial second 
manufacturing process (Process E) is approximately a fourfold batch size increase with certain process 
parameters adjusted to accommodate the increase in process scale. 
The primary packaging is into a Type I borosilicate flint glass vial and closed with a Type I bromobutyl 
stopper which is sealed with an aluminium flip-tear off combination seal. The material complies with Ph. 
Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

The finished product is provided as drug/device combination together with the Lamira nebuliser system 
specific for the delivery of the finished product. The nebuliser system is a single patient use, reusable 
electronic nebuliser device for the inhalation delivery of medication. The Lamira nebuliser system consists 
of three major components, including aerosol head, handset and controller. The aerosol head is mounted 
into the handset and employs a technology that consists of a circular metal disk (membrane), perforated 
with thousands of laser-drilled holes. A ring-shaped piezoelectric actuator is used to vibrate the 
membrane at a high frequency to create an alternating pressure field. This alternating pressure forces 
ALIS through the holes producing a dense aerosol cloud on the distal side of the membrane which is then 
inhaled. The diameter of the membrane holes determines the aerosol droplet size. For inhalation, the 
drug is dispensed from an individual vial into the reservoir of the nebuliser handset by removing the 
Reservoir Cover (cap). ALIS is sealed into the reservoir when the cap is placed back onto the reservoir and 
locked in position. The reservoir design acts like a funnel to feed ALIS into contact with the perforated 
metal disk (the membrane) of the aerosol head. The bottom of the reservoir’s funnel section also has a 
flexible sealing component that prevents the medication from leaking around the aerosol head. The 
controller provides the electrical signal to drive the aerosol head and provides the user interface for 
turning the nebuliser on and off. The controller has a display showing symbols indicating the actual mode 
of the device including charge of batteries and giving information of possible operation modes if 
necessary. The controller also features audible and LED light indicators next to the Controller On/Off 
button that provide audio-visual feedback to the user. This medical device has the EC declaration of 
conformity for medical devices. The applicant has provided satisfactory data on the characterisation of the 
aerodynamic particle size distribution and delivery dose via a breath simulator in line with Ph. Eur. 2.9.44 
and EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr. Weekly ultrasonic cleaning is required according to the 
instructions for use (IFU). Performance was investigated for six nebulisers with or without this cleaning 
over 84 days. It was concluded than sonication cleaning is appropriate and that the nebuliser is robust 
enough for this regimen over three months. However, based on the burden on patients that cleaning 
presents it is now proposed to replace the nebuliser head every seven days. Two studies were conducted 
to provide a qualitative assessment of the extractable profiles and semi-quantitative estimates of the 
amounts of extractables of the ALIS handset. Organic extractables above the calculated analytical 
evaluation threshold of 42 µg/day were reported and subject to toxicological assessment. No extractables 
of concerns were identified and the health risk (taking the vial and stopper extractables into account as 
well) is considered negligible by the applicant. For leachables, the entire handset was exposed to ALIS. No 
organic leachables were reported i.e. below 42 µg/handset. The levels of elemental impurities were not of 
concern i.e. very low and/or below ICH Q3D control thresholds where applicable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in two manufacturing sites. Each manufacturing site applies 
exclusively either manufacturing process D or E. Both manufacturing processes are the same, only 
differences related to size and within sterilization conditions due to equipment settings are noted. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product using Process D and Process E consists in 6 main steps: 
compounding of process solutions, liposome formation and bulk processing, potency adjustment (if 
required), aseptic vial filling and stoppering, seal crimping of filled vials and inspection, and secondary 
packaging. The processes are considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The critical parameters identified during development and process validation are described and the 
applied acceptance ranges have been justified. Holding time has been confirmed by validation data and is 
acceptable. The in-process controls used for both manufacturing process are adequate for this 
pharmaceutical form.  
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 19/109 
 
 
 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on production scale 
batches using process D, with one batch covering the new filter flush step. The process parameter data 
demonstrates that the manufacturer has tight control of the CPPs that influence sterile liposome 
formation and filling. The data indicated that a sufficient level of control is in place to consistently produce 
product meeting the quality requirements. The details provided of process validation for three production 
scale batches using process E are very similar to process D and acceptable.  
The data provided on both process (D and E) on the sterilising filters is extensive and acceptable, 
extractable and leachable studies are detailed. Data is provided on several parameters not specific to this 
product, e.g. sterilisation of components, but provides additional sterility assurance 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications, include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification of amikacin (HPLC, TLC), identification of sulfate (Ph. Eur.), pH, 
osmolality (Ph. Eur.), amikacin concentration (HPLC), percent associated amikacin (HPLC), amikacin 
degradation products (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), DPPC concentration (HPLC), cholesterol 
concentration (HPLC), lipid to drug ratio, lipid degradation product (HPLC), residual ethanol (GC), 
liposome particle size (photon correlation spectroscopy), aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) 
post nebulization using the Next Generation Impactor (NGI), percent associated amikacin post 
nebulization (HPLC), In vitro release (HPLC), fill weight (gravimetric), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacteria 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
A discussion was provided on impurities, which are separated into different categories: amikacin-related, 
DPPC-related, cholesterol related, residual solvents and elemental impurities. 
Process-related impurities of amikacin are monitored in the active substance but not in the finished 
product, in which only degradation products are monitored. The only process-related impurities that are 
also degradants are kanamycin (Ph. Eur. Imp D), and Ph. Eur. Imp I.  
The sources of potential elemental impurities in batches of the finished product include the raw materials 
and water, the container closure system and the manufacturing equipment. The manufacturer of 
amikacin sulfate), DPPC, and cholesterol all have attested that they do not employ ICH Class 2B elements 
in their processes. Additionally, the raw materials DPPC and cholesterol are tested for heavy metals using 
the current colorimetric compendial test method. The other excipients meet Ph. Eur. requirements. It is 
considered unlikely that that elemental impurities are introduced into the finished product from the 
manufacturing equipment due to the materials used and the GMP procedures that are in place.  
A risk assessment was conducted to assess the potential contamination of nitrosamine during the finished 
product manufacturing from excipients and raw materials, manufacturing process, and container closure 
system. Based on this risk assessment, it was concluded that there is neither a risk of introducing 
nitrosamines to the finished product by excipients, nor a risk of formation of nitrosamines during the 
manufacturing and storage of the finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for very large number of batches covering each iteration of the 
manufacturing process (A to E), including batches at non-commercial concentrations or in other container 
closures. For the proposed commercial processes (D and E) and sites, data from a combined number of 62 
batches are presented. Of these batches, 24 (covering both sites) were used in phase 3 studies. The 
Assessment report

results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from twenty four different sizes batches of the finished product stored in the upright 
orientation included in these are batches from process B2, D and E for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (5°C ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C ± 2°C) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, pH, liposome particle size distribution, amikacin content, percent 
associated amikacin, amikacin degradation products, DPPC content, cholesterol content, lipid degradation 
product, percent associated amikacin post nebulization, liposome particle size post nebulization, APSD, 
particulate matter, and sterility.   
No significant changes have been observed under long term and accelerated stability conditions. It was 
demonstrated for tested stability batches that storage temperature and orientation have no impact. 
In-use testing was performed for up to three months after long-term storage at 2-8°C for 24 months and 
up to two months after long term storage at 2-8°C for 36 months. Results demonstrate that the in-use 
period of the product is 4 weeks storage at 20-25°C with excursions permitted between 15-30°C.  
Three separate studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of temperature changes. In one batch 
stored at 2-8°C for 15 months in the upright orientation testing was performed to provide baseline data 
for evaluating the effects of each condition. There is no other impact on the stability of the finished 
product. 
The effects of short-term thermal exposure were studied. The data demonstrate that both short term and 
periodic temperature excursions up to 40°C affected nothing other than the rate of DPPC degradation to 
Lyso PC. 
Freeze-thaw effect was assessed. Characterization tests were also performed and the in-vitro release, as 
well as the density gradient profile showed significant differences when compared to data for Cycle 0. 
These data demonstrate that the finished product cannot be frozen. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as required by the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. All reported results for all tests were within the acceptable limits of 
the current specification. Therefore, the finished product does not need to be protected from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 
8 °C), do not freeze, discard any vial that has been frozen, can be stored at room temperature below 
25 °C for up to 4 weeks once at room temperature, any unused medicine must be discarded at the end of 
4 weeks as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Amikacin as an aminoglycoside antibiotic with known properties and for which there is extensive clinical 
experience with parenteral administration. Therefore, the applicant has submitted a limited primary 
pharmacology package for amikacin liposome inhalation solution (ALIS) and this is considered 
acceptable. In-vitro studies utilising adherent human macrophages infected with three M. avium strains 
(MAC 104, A5, and MAC 3388) demonstrate that ALIS is more bactericidal than non-liposomal amikacin 
referred to as free amikacin (FA) at equivalent amikacin concentrations (10 μg/mL). 
ALIS was shown to exhibit increased uptake of fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) tagged 
amikacin into THP-1 human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro relative to FA. Similar results were 
reported in cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from rodents administered either ALIS 
or FA via inhalation with ALIS treated animals exhibiting higher BAL cell concentrations of amikacin 
relative to FA treated animals. 
An in-vivo efficacy study undertaken in C57B6 mice infected with M. avium strain 104 demonstrated that 
inhaled ALIS administered via a number of different schedules exhibited at least similar efficacy in terms 
of reducing lung bacterial load relative to i.p. administered FA (100 mg/kg). Dosing every other day at 
152 mg/kg was shown to be as effective as daily dosing at 76 mg/kg over 28 days with the higher dose 
every other day schedule resulting in a greater number of mice in which the infection was completely 
eradicated. In all ALIS treated groups the reduction in mean CFU/lung was numerically superior to 28 
dosing with FA i.p., these differences were not however statistically significant.  
A single in-vitro study examining the penetration of liposomes into sputum from a CF patient has been 
submitted in the secondary pharmacology section. This study is not a secondary pharmacology study. It 
was conducted to support the previously sought indication for CF patients and is not directly relevant for 
the current application. No dedicated secondary pharmacology studies have been conducted. Given the 
pharmacology of amikacin has previously been characterised and its clinical safety profile via other routes 
of administration is well established this is considered acceptable.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In the context of this application the primary pharmacodynamics concern measurements of the effects of 
inhaled ALIS on non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and, especially, MAC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 22/109 
 
 
 
The applicant summarised 8 studies from the literature that report on the activity of amikacin against 
MAC.  
For the discussion on the primary pharmacology of amikacin see section 2.4.3. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary pharmacodynamic effects centre on the effects of inhalation of liposomal amikacin on 
pulmonary function tests. In the NTM/MAC studies, these data are considered most important for the 
assessment of safety. However, they are described below, along with the microbiological and other 
clinical endpoints.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted. This is considered acceptable as the clinical 
safety profile of amikacin is well characterised and the systemic exposure to amikacin is significantly 
higher following parenteral administration of currently authorised products than following ALIS 
administration. ECG and respiratory measurements were taken as part of the 30-day repeat dose 
inhalation administration dog toxicity study utilising an early formulation of ALIS (Sustained release Lipid 
Inhalation Targeting, SLIT) (Study no. 667574). Treatment with SLIT was not associated with any dose 
dependent differences in respiratory or ECG measures. No statistical analysis of these data is presented. 
However, this is considered acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In-vitro drug combination studies relevant to inhalation of ALIS have not been conducted. Numerous 
published studies have evaluated the combined antimycobacterial effect of amikacin and other agents 
used to treat Mycobacterial infections and have shown lack of antagonism.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The methods of analysis used in pivotal studies have been appropriately validated in terms of selectivity, 
accuracy, precision, stability, linearity and limits of quantification. Some minor deviations to what is 
normally considered acceptable were noted but these are unlikely to affect the interpretation of results 
generated via these methods. The methods of analysis are considered appropriately validated and 
acceptable. 
The applicant has submitted a summary of several small-scale PK studies conducted in Sprague-Dawley 
rats. Oral bioavailability of amikacin is confirmed as very low ≈0.002% and 0.3% (of interest as up to 
50% of amikacin administered as ALIS was recovered in the stomach). Absorption from the lungs 
following a single inhalation administration is rapid with Tmax reached at the first time point analysed. 
Elimination is biphasic with a rapid initial elimination following by a slower prolonged phase with amikacin 
concentrations shown to be significantly higher in lung tissue relative to serum up to 1 week following a 
single inhalation administration. ALIS was also shown to exhibit higher lung concentrations relative the 
same dose (60 mg/kg) of FA via inhalation administration. No dedicated PK data on absorption in dog has 
been provided but TK data have been acquired in pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies.    
The applicant submitted a number of dedicated single dose studies in rat examining the distribution of 
ALIS within the lung in comparison to FA as well as studies comparing the distribution of fluorescently 
labelled amikacin (amikacin-TAMRA) in ALIS as well as fluorescently labelled liposomes. No dedicated 
studies examining systemic distribution have been submitted, though a summary of organ concentrations 
following single administration was submitted, indicating relatively low systemic distribution. No data on 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 23/109 
 
 
 
melanin binding have been submitted. Bibliographic sources indicate that amikacin is not extensively 
protein bound (≈3.6%).  
Lung amikacin concentrations following inhalation ALIS administration to rats are shown to exhibit 
biphasic elimination with a rapid initial alpha phase (lung t1/2 ≈7 hours) followed by a more prolonged beta 
phase (lung t1/2 ≈400 hours). The applicant has interpreted these data as the initial phase representing 
clearance of FA released during the nebulisation process (≈45%) with retention of liposomal amikacin at 
longer time points related to incorporation of the liposomes into macrophages. The interpretation of 
distribution to macrophages is based on the observation of punctate staining at later time points in the 
lungs of ALIS treated animals not present in FA treated animals. No co-staining with macrophage related 
markers has been conducted. This interpretation is endorsed (and supported based on in-vitro data 
discussed above reporting that liposomal formulation is associated with increased macrophage uptake).  
Distribution was also assessed via fluorescence spectrophotometry and microscopy using 
DiIC18(5)DS-labelled ALIS liposomes. These analyses revealed that DiIC18(5)DS-labelled liposomes 
were equally distributed in the lungs with initial distribution to the large and small airways and then 
intracellularly in macrophages in tissues surrounding the airways or in alveoli. Clearance of DiIC18(5)DS 
from the lungs was slower than that of amikacin, free DiIC18(5)DS was cleared from the lungs more 
rapidly than DiIC18(5)DS administered in ALIS (i.e., with amikacin). DiIC18(5)DS was eliminated from 
the lung linearly in contrast to the previously defined biphasic elimination kinetics of amikacin. It should 
be noted that this lipid label is not a mimetic for DPPC or cholesterol to be used in the marketed product 
and so is only useful for demonstrating the initial distribution of the liposomes but not the fate of the 
constituent components. This is acceptable as the liposomal constituents are endogenous to the lung. 
A single multiple dose PK study has been submitted in which rats were administered ALIS at daily doses 
of either 10 or 90 mg/kg for a period of 28 days. Again, this study focused on lung distribution and 
reported uniform distribution and clearance from the lung. Amikacin concentrations in the lung increased 
with dose (Cmax and AUC in high dose group ≈ 2-fold lower dose group). It should be noted that on the 
last day of dosing both groups received the same (high dose) which should which may partly explain this 
observation. In contrast, the concentration of conjugated amikacin-TAMRA did not increase with dose 
with the lower dose group exhibiting similar/higher concentrations relative the high dose group.  
This issue was raised in the previous MAA and it is accepted that this isolated finding is likely specific to 
amikacin-TAMRA given the dose related exposures observed in all GLP-compliant repeat dose toxicity 
studies. The fraction of ALIS that remained in the lung appeared to be sequestered into pulmonary 
macrophages with deposition appearing uniform among the lobes/sections analysed. 
Two single dose studies have been conducted examining the clearance of ALIS examining elimination 24 
hours and 21-days post dose. These focus on clearance from the lungs but examination of urine 
concentrations following inhalation administration suggest that, following systemic absorption of 
amikacin from ALIS, it primarily undergoes renal excretion. Elimination time from the lung following ALIS 
administration is longer than following FA administration (≈2-fold increase in lung elimination t1/2). 
Sub-regional lung analysis confirms that elimination proceeds uniformly across the whole lung. Both 
serum and urine concentrations of amikacin were reported as greater following single dose FA relative to 
ALIS administration 24 hours post dose. However, in contrast in the study examining the 21-day post 
dose period, the concentration of amikacin was comparable in serum in ALIS and FA treated groups and 
urine concentration was higher in the ALIS treated relative to the FA treated group. A clear cause for this 
contradictory finding is not evident. Data from the GLP-compliant 30-day repeat dose toxicity study in 
rats following SLIT administration reported similar urine levels following 30 days dosing.  
A full discussion of the systemic elimination of amikacin has not been provided. However, it is accepted 
that elimination should not differ following ALIS administration relative to authorised IV administrations. 
Additional information related to elimination of aminoglycosides based on literature review was furnished

by the applicant in response to a query on this point raised as part of the initial MAA. Aminoglycosides are 
not significantly metabolised, undergo glomerular filtration and are actively resorbed in the proximal 
kidney tubules. It is considered unlikely that aminoglycosides are taken up by members of the organic ion 
transporters such as the organic anion transporter (OAT) and organic cation transporter (OCT) families 
which are expressed in the renal proximal tubule, with megalin, a multi-ligand endocytic receptor that is 
most abundantly expressed in the renal proximal tubules in segments 1 and 2, shown to mediate uptake 
of polybasic drugs such as aminoglycosides. The precise mechanism of resorption remains to be 
elucidated. In conjunction with the available clinical experience with amikacin administered parenterally, 
this is considered acceptable. No non-clinical PK DDI studies have been completed, this was acceptable to 
the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted with ALIS, which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose inhalation toxicity studies with ALIS included a 6-month study in rats (with a 3-month 
interim evaluation), a 3-month study in dogs, and a 9-month study in dogs (with a 6-month interim 
evaluation of in-life findings); each study also included a recovery period. These studies are considered 
pivotal regarding human safety.  
A 13-week repeat dose toxicity study was conducted in mice. ALIS was well tolerated in this study. 
Primary findings included treatment related slight nasal turbinate degeneration at mid and high doses and 
increased foamy alveolar macrophages in the lungs. These findings were thought to be non-specific 
reactive changes to drug administration. Active foci of inflammation were evident in high dose animals in 
this study (90 mg/kg/day) which was interpreted as a response to macrophage degeneration following 
phagocytic overload.   
A 30-day GLP compliant study conducted in rat utilising an early stage (SLIT) formulation of ALIS and 
inhaled FA reported that administration for this duration was relatively well tolerated. Primary findings 
related to increased foamy alveolar macrophages. Of note, focal alveolar macrophage accumulation was 
also evident in the empty liposomal control (ELC) treated group, demonstrating that the liposomes alone 
can induce this finding and supporting the applicants position that this finding is related to the 
non-specific clearance of the liposomes for the lungs. Lipid staining of lung sections did not provide any 
evidence of excessive accumulation of phospholipids. Plasma concentrations were only above the limits of 
quantification in high dose and FA groups (100 mg/kg/day) and were similar/higher in FA relative to SLIT 
high dose treated groups with the inverse shown in terms of lung concentrations. No NOAEL was defined 
in the study report though is listed as 100 mg/kg in the submitted toxicology summary. 
In the 6-month repeat dose toxicity study conducted in rats (Study 07-6308) animals were administered 
ALIS at doses of 10, 30 or 90 mg/kg/day via nose-only inhalation. No FA or ELC groups were included in 
this study. Target organs identified were the lung, nasal turbinates, kidney and larynx. TK data acquired 
show non-linear and less than dose proportional increases in systemic exposure. Of note, low levels of 
amikacin were still present in lungs of recovery animals (i.e. following the 12-week recovery period). 
Primary findings were increased lung weight and macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with an 
increase in foamy alveolar macrophages which was dose-related. At mid and high dose multiple 
inflammatory foci were also observed. Degenerative changes in the nasal turbinates and laryngeal 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 25/109 
 
 
 
changes including squamous/squamoid metaplasia/hyperplasia of the pseudostratified columnar 
epithelium in the larynx, and degenerative changes of the tracheal epithelium were attributed to a 
non-specific response to test-article administration. This is endorsed.  
Nephropathy was evident in the high dose group at terminal sacrifice with higher prevalence in males 
relative to females. This is in line with the known systemic toxicity profile of aminoglycosides. The lung 
NOAEL was below the lowest dose tested in this study (i.e. < 10 mg/kg) due to the inflammatory and 
adaptive changes identified at all dose levels with the NOAEL for nephropathy set at 30 mg/kg/day.  
Alveolar fibrosis was evident in several high dose animals at recovery which was not evident at treatment 
termination suggesting prolonged inflammation following treatment cessation. Further clarification on the 
cause of the continued inflammatory response was raised as a major objection in the assessment of the 
original MAA submission. The applicant provided additional argumentation that these findings were 
species-specific and are consistent with particle overload in the lungs following chronic inhalation 
administration to rats. Repeated deposition of particulates to the lungs can lead to chronic inflammation, 
particularly in rats due to anatomical and biological differences including smaller lung size volume and 
surface area and smaller macrophage size relative to larger animals. A characteristic of particle overload 
is impaired macrophage clearance function, associated with pulmonary inflammation, centroacinar and 
interstitial accumulation of particles and, eventually, epithelial cell proliferation possibly leading to 
chronic damage including fibrosis and neoplasia. 
Similar changes have been observed following administration of other inhaled aminoglycosides to 
rodents. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.  
A one-month repeat-dose toxicity study was carried out with an early ALIS formulation (SLIT) in dog. 
Findings were similar to those previously reported in rats with an increase in lung weight and lung foamy 
macrophage numbers reported. These showed a trend towards reversal in the one-month recovery 
group. On note the death of one high dose male in his study was associated with enterotoxaemia 
secondary to Gram-positive GI infection. This may indicate an effect of treatment on normal commensal 
bacteria in the GI tract. TK data from this study again show lower systemic and high lung amikacin 
concentrations in the high dose SLIT treated group relative to FA treated group. No treatment-related 
effects associated with ELC administration were evident in this study. 
The 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dog reported similar findings with all treated animals exhibiting 
an increase in lung weight which was recoverable following cessation of treatment. Dose dependant 
increases in foamy macrophages in lung and mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were 
reported. The findings in the lung were still present following in recovery animals following a 2-month 
treatment free period but were of lower severity than observed in terminal sacrifice animals suggesting 
reversibility. Of note, lung tissue concentrations were still 30% of those observed at terminal sacrifice in 
recovery animals demonstrating prolonged lung exposures. No other findings in this study were 
attributed to the test-article. The NOAEL for lung changes in this study was set at the highest dose 
observed as it was suggested that increases in lung macrophages and weight were a non-adverse 
adaptive response to administration related to clearance of ALIS. 
In the pivotal 9-month repeat-dose toxicity study in dog primary findings again related to dose dependent 
increases in foamy alveolar foamy macrophages associated with increased lung weights. In the high dose 
groups in this study (30 mg/kg) this finding was still evident though at lower severity following the 
three-month recovery period. This was not associated with squamous metaplasia or 
proliferative/neoplastic changes in the lung. Increased numbers of foamy macrophages were also evident 
in mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes at all dose levels at treatment termination. Basophilic 
granules were evident in epithelial cells at the apex of the tracheal bifurcation indicative of deposition and 
epithelial uptake of the test article at doses in excess of 10 mg/kg. This finding was still evident but with 
lower frequency following the recovery period. The NOAEL for this study was set at 30 mg/kg/day, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020

highest dose tested. This is not endorsed, at this does level following a 3-month recovery period, several 
findings were still evident including increased lung weight, foamy alveolar macrophages and foamy 
macrophages with intracytoplasmic basophilic granules in the mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph 
nodes. Exposure margins based on systemic exposures from NOAELs identified in pivotal repeat dose 
toxicity studies to clinical exposures at the proposed dose are less than 1. Exposure margins when 
calculated on a delivered dose/g lung weight basis are greater ≈5 based on 9-month dog study (taking 10 
mg/kg/day as the NOAEL) with no NOAEL defined in rat studies. 
Genotoxicity 
ALIS was not genotoxic in a standard battery of battery of tests as per ICH S2(R1). 
Carcinogenicity 
A single carcinogenicity study in rat following life-time inhalation exposure has been submitted. A study 
in a single species was considered appropriate to assess the effects of inhalation administration on 
carcinogenic risk as the clinical safety profile following IV exposure is well established, this is considered 
acceptable. Positive neoplastic findings were reported in this study. In the high dose female group (45 
mg/kg/day) squamous cell carcinomas were observed in the lungs of 2 of 60 animals at study 
termination. As squamous cell carcinomas are rare in the rat lung these findings were considered 
treatment related. An increased incidence of non-neoplastic proliferative changes was also evident in this 
group with a keratinizing pulmonary cyst in one female and foci of squamous metaplasia of the alveolar 
epithelium evident in two females at 45 mg/kg/day. The keratinising pulmonary cyst had characteristics 
similar to a squamous cell carcinoma.  
Bronchiolo/alveolar adenomas were found in 1 male and 1 female administered ALIS at 45mg/kg/day. 
The applicant contends that although this finding only occurred in the high dose group it was within the 
historical control range and therefore is of uncertain relationship to ALIS administration. This view is 
questionable given these findings only occurred in the high dose group. 
One male and one female in the low dose group (5mg/kg/day) and one male in the high dose group (45 
mg/kg/day) died from squamous cell carcinoma of the palate which was of uncertain relationship to ALIS 
administration. This tumour is known to occur in low incidence and these findings were not statistically 
significant relative to concurrent controls. Because these occurred sporadically without dose response 
they are considered of uncertain relationship to the test article. 
Alveolar epithelium hyperplasia with dose dependent severity was evident in all treated groups. 
Non-proliferative lung changes included diffusely distributed foamy alveolar macrophages, 
focal/multifocal aggregates of alveolar foamy macrophages and interstitial/alveolar inflammation in line 
findings from repeat-dose toxicology studies. Similarly, minimal to slight aggregates of foamy 
macrophages were present in the mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes. The incidence of these findings 
in the ELC group was similar to that in the mid dose ALIS group and the applicant attributes these findings 
to normal clearance of the liposomes from the lung. This is not fully endorsed as there is an increased total 
incidence and severity in the high dose group which received a similar lipid dose as the ELC group 
indicating these effects are (at least partially) amikacin related. 
An increased incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in the 
high dose male group. However, this was not considered test-article related as the increase was not 
statistically significant relative to controls and was still within historical control rates. These findings are 
represented in the proposed SmPC and should be taken into consideration in the benefit risk assessment 
of the product.

Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
No dedicated developmental/reproductive toxicology studies with ALIS have been carried out. This 
approach is considered acceptable as there is significant clinical experience with the administration of 
amikacin via alternative routes resulting in significantly higher systemic exposures and aminoglycosides 
as a class. The applicant has made reference to a number of studies in publicly available literature which 
have assessed the potential reproductive toxicity of amikacin when administered via a different route of 
administration. These studies were not performed to GLP but are appropriately designed and considered 
of good quality and do not indicate a direct risk of teratogenicity or fetotoxicity associated with amikacin 
administration. Furthermore, ALIS administration was not associated with any adverse effects on 
reproductive organs in pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
The non-standard nature of the submitted reproductive toxicity studies is outlined in the SmPC.  
Juvenile toxicity 
The applicant submitted two juvenile toxicity studies completed in rat. These are not directly relevant to 
the current submission as the proposed indication for ALIS is for administration to adults only and is 
therefore considered supportive data only. In the initial dose range-finding study, ALIS administration to 
rat pups from post-natal day (PND) 10 is reported as being well tolerated up to the maximum dose tested 
(60 mg/kg/day for 28 days). Therefore, the top dose for the pivotal juvenile toxicity study was set at 90 
mg/kg/day. Following 28-days administration to rat pups from PND 10 findings were similar to those 
observed in adult animals. These related to dose dependent increases in foamy alveolar macrophages and 
laryngeal epithelial erosion/ulceration with minimal to slight epithelial hyperplasia in the respiratory 
epithelium. These were reversible/trending for reversing at the end of the recovery period. No additional 
toxicity on sexual maturity, bone development or motor activity was noted. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Two dedicated immunotoxicity studies were conducted, one following the administration of an early stage 
formulation to rats for 14 days and following administration of ALIS to rats for up to three 30-day cycles. 
In the 14-day study administration of 19.9 mg/mL of early stage formulation of ALIS (SLIT) was not 
associated with any significant difference in terms of BALF TNF-α, nitrite or cell numbers relative to FA or 
saline treated animals. 
ALIS administration to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg for up to three 30 day cycles with 30-day recovery 
periods was not associated with any significant effect on BALF TNF-α or nitrite content relative to saline 
treated controls. No effect on BALF derived macrophage opsonisation or yeast killing capacity was noted 
ex-vivo. Treatment was associated with a significant increase in BALF cell content which composed of 
alveolar macrophages and (presumed peripheral) polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. BALF derived 
macrophages from treated animals were twice the size of those from saline treated controls, this was 
reversed following recovery. Macrophages isolated from treated animals were shown to produce nitric 
oxide and TNF-α in response to an LPS challenge. However, this response differed in magnitude from 
control animal isolates with lower levels of TNF-α and higher levels of nitrites relative evident. The 
applicant attributes this to the effects of PMN nitric oxide production resulting in decreased macrophage 
TNF-α. However, this is not convincing as the differences in expression of these markers remain 
significantly different from controls following recovery at which point BALF cell content has returned to 
control levels. Hence, these data indicate that ALIS administration may be associated with altered lung 
macrophage function. Of note, this study only assessed function following 30-days continuous exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 28/109 
 
 
 
 
and only examined two markers of inflammation. Data from longer term studies in rats indicate that 
prolonged exposure may result in impaired macrophage function as per the above discussion on the 
carcinogenicity findings. 
Impurities/Leachables 
Impurities’ profile of ALIS could be considered as qualified and accepted from the toxicological point of 
view. The container closure system and valve components have a number of plastic and elastomeric 
components from which a range of compounds could potentially leach or be extracted into the 
formulation. Leachable studies were performed on both the primary container closure system (vials and 
stoppers) and the Lamira nebuliser system. Toxicology assessments of the identified leachables from the 
container closure, mouthpiece, and the Lamira nebuliser system and in-use simulation of amikacin 
liposome inhalation dispersion were conducted. Compounds were evaluated that were above the final 
analytical evaluation threshold which was derived from the Product Quality Research Institute (PQRI) 
recommended SCT of 0.15 μg/day. These evaluations concluded that there is a negligible health risk to 
humans under conditions of use. Margins of exposure (MOE) were determined for each compound by 
comparing the total daily intake (TDI) to the PDE (i.e., PDE/TDI). Toxicity information generated using 
inhalation routes of administration was used when possible. Based on the PDE value and the TDI of each 
organic compound, all 13 compounds present a negligible health risk because each MOE was well above 
the value of 1. In most cases, element MOEs were well above 1 for each element with the exception of 
nickel, chromium, and manganese. However, in the leachable study for elements with ALIS or saline, 
none of these three elements were identified, indicating a negligible health risk under conditions of use. 
All of the 7 elements found in the leachate had MOE substantially higher than the value of 1 supporting the 
absence of significant risk to human health under conditions of used of the ALIS drug product. Two 
elements, bromine and magnesium, were present in the handset leachates but not in the handset 
extracts. Magnesium is traceable to the ALIS stopper. Bromine was not identified in any extract but has 
an MOE value well above the PDE. It was presumed that the identified leachables are expected to pose a 
negligible health risk to humans under conditions of use. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I PEC calculation showed that ALIS exceeded the action limit. Logkow was experimentally 
determined using the shake-flask method and was <-2 indicating this drug is unlikely to bioaccumulate in 
aquatic organisms.  
Amikacin was shown not to be biodegradable in an OECD 301B compliant study and shown to be highly 
mobile in sludge and soil extracts in an OECD 106 compliant study indicating no need for an assessment 
of terrestrial toxicity assessment. An appropriately conducted OECD 308 study reported amikacin to 
exhibit long half lives in both water and sediment in two rive systems with little to no degradation or 
metabolism detected indicating persistence as well as significant partitioning (>10%) to sediment. Of 
note, the provided normalization of DT50 values from this study to 12 °C has been done using an 
outdated conversion factor (Q10 = 2.2) which is not considered acceptable. For the temperature 
correction to 12 °C in simulation studies, the Arrhenius equation with a specific activation energy Ea of 
64.5 kJ/mol (current Q10 factor of 2.58) has to be used (see REACH R.7b, p. 222). Based on the data 
presented, amikacin was shown to be very persistent. Therefore, a phase IIB study on the effects of 
amikacin on sediment dwelling organisms was conducted (OECD 218, see below).  
Amikacin was shown to dose dependently inhibit respiration in STP organisms in the activated sludge 
respiration test (OECD 209) with EC10 and EC50 values were 0.3 and 114 mg/L, respectively. No NOEC 
was defined in this study but is accepted that the EC10 for these effects is several orders of magnitude 
greater than the refined PECsurfacewater and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk.  
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 29/109 
 
 
 
Toxicity was evaluated in several aquatic species in OECD 201, 210 and 211 compliant studies with 
Anabaena flos-aquae algae demonstrating the greatest sensitivity with a NOEC of 1.7 µg/L. The use of 
this species is acceptable for the assessment of an antimicrobial in line with the question 11 of the ERA 
Q&A document. This was based on the measured time weighted average concentration in the test system 
and is considered appropriate. The mean co-efficient of variation for section by section growth rates in the 
controls was significantly higher than the validity criteria of not more than 35% (158%). This was justified 
by the applicant as related to low cell density at early intervals and stated as not uncommon for historical 
control data for Anabaena flos-aquae at the laboratory. Similar findings were noted in treatment groups 
supporting the applicant’s argument. The applicant provided historical control data from the test facility 
indicating that this was indeed a common finding. Given Anabaena flos-aquae was identified as the most 
sensitive species in the ERA and therefore used for pivotal PEC/PNEC calculations it is considered essential 
that this test is performed adequately. As such, in line with the answer to question 11 ii) of the EMAs Q&A 
document on the ‘Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1)’, due to the cited limitations in the completed study, the applicant 
committed to submit an appropriately conducted OECD 201 study. 
Toxicity is reported as much lower as assessed in appropriately conducted studies as per OECD 210 and 
211. PEC/PNEC comparisons do not indicate amikacin as posing a threat to the environment. However, 
due to the concern raised on the conduct of the OECD 201 study which was shown to be the most sensitive 
to the effects of amikacin, available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of 
amikacin to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Toxicology 
The applicant considers the lung carcinogenicity findings species specific. Additional discussion on these 
data and justification as to the species-specific nature of the findings was requested as part of a 
non-clinical major objection at day 120 of the initial procedure with additional justification submitted at 
that time and included in the non-clinical overview in this submission. The applicant states that the 
positive findings observed in this study occur via a non-genotoxic mechanism as ALIS was shown to be 
non-genotoxic in a standard battery. The applicant claimed that the findings are species-specific and 
related to a particulate overload, which is suggested to be threshold based (with tumorigenesis evident in 
animals dosed over 1 mg/g lung weight).  
Additional argumentation has been provided based on species differences in relative pulmonary surface 
area and macrophage size to further support the contention this finding is species specific. The applicant 
also comments that no lung inflammatory or neoplastic changes were observed following up to 9-months 
inhalation administration to dog in the pivotal repeat dose toxicity study (Study 11-6400). Finally, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 31/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applicant includes a comparison to reported non-clinical lung pathology findings from other inhalable 
aminoglycosides. 
While these arguments are reasonable, they are not sufficient to conclude on the clinical relevance of the 
rat findings. It is accepted that amikacin is non-genotoxic and the proposed threshold effect on particulate 
clearance may in part explain these findings in rats. The applicant suggests that the neoplastic findings 
induced by particulate overload in rats are of questionable clinical relevance. This is not endorsed. The 
applicant suggests that these particulate overload- induced neoplastic lung changes in rat are secondary 
to chronic pulmonary inflammation. It is noted that amikacin is a bronchial irritant clinically with allergic 
alveolitis an identified risk in the proposed RMP, bronchospasm included as an AR in the proposed SmPC 
and cases of interstitial lung disease reported. These findings suggest that prolonged administration may 
result in human lung inflammation with unknown consequences.  
Although the similarities in lung pathology findings are noted, in the absence of long-term administration 
studies for comparison, the reference to the development programmes of other inhaled aminoglycosides 
is not considered directly relevant to the question of carcinogenicity. Furthermore, as part of the 
responses, the applicant acknowledged the potential for a disease-drug interaction resulting in increased 
patient sensitivity to ALIS administration.  
It is considered unlikely that additional non-clinical mechanistic studies or a request for further 
justification will alter the understanding of the clinical relevance of these findings at this time. As such, 
this potential risk should be taken into consideration when assessing the benefit risk of the product, 
information on this risk is included in the SmPC and this will be monitored in PSURs in the normal manner. 
No dedicated reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with ALIS have been conducted. This is 
considered acceptable and the applicant has provided data from bibliographic sources to cover this 
requirement. The wording in the SmPC appropriately reflects this. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The applicant has completed an ERA in line with the EMAs ‘Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use’. In general, the ERA was conducted appropriately but 
the applicant was requested to repeat the completed OECD 201 study as it did not meet its predefined

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical major objections are raised to the approval of Arikayce liposomal. However, it should be 
noted that the uncertain clinical relevance of the rat carcinogenicity findings should be taken into 
consideration when assessing the benefit risk of this product.

Report. 
The focus is on systemic exposures to amikacin after inhalation of ALIS once daily. Once amikacin reaches 
the systemic circulation, its PK properties are very well known. The mean serum half-life of amikacin after 
IV administration to adults is ~ 2 h with a mean Vd of 24 L (28% of the body weight). By the ultrafiltration 
technique, reports of serum protein binding range from 0 to 11%. Mean serum clearance rate is about 100 
mL/min and the renal clearance rate is 94 mL/min in subjects with normal renal function. At low plasma 
concentrations, it is apparent that there is some tubular reabsorption that is saturated and thus not 
detectable at the exposures achieved with routine IV doses. 
Distribution 
The distribution of ALIS after inhalation was initially evaluated in RD 201/23924, in which 6 healthy male 
subjects received 120 mg 99mTc-radiolabelled amikacin loaded into liposomes using one of two versions of 
the nebuliser. A ventilation scan was performed using 81mKr radioactive gas to characterise the deposition 
of the amikacin-loaded liposomes by defining the ventilated area of the lungs. The margins of the lungs 
that were defined were used as a template to permit accurate determination of pulmonary deposition of 
radiolabelled drug.  
Five subjects completed inhalation of the dose. The mean recovery of radioactivity was 102%. The mean 
fraction of the emitted dose impacting in the oropharyngeal region and swallowed was 12.3% whereas 
47.8% of the emitted dose was deposited on the exhalation filter and mouthpiece. For all 6 subjects the 
mean emitted dose to lungs was 39.9% (with means of 32.3% and 47.5% in the nebuliser subgroups). 
Based on the measured fraction of the loaded dose retained within the nebuliser (mean 61.2%) and the 
fraction of the emitted dose delivered to lungs, it was calculated that 15.5% of the loaded dose was 
deposited in lungs and the mean dose reaching the lungs was 17.2 mg.

The calculations were very similar for the three subjects who were dosed in conjunction with the system 
vs. those dosed using a Pari Compressor (mean doses of amikacin reaching lungs were 17.9 mg and 16.5 
mg, respectively). 
The pattern of radiolabelled liposome deposition within the lung (based on the penetration index sC/P; the 
ratio of the counts in the central/peripheral lung regions corrected for regional lung volume) was 
described by a mean sC/P ratio of 1.47 (1.3 vs. 1.63 for the two subgroups described above). The data to 
calculate sC/P were derived from images acquired at about 20 min after the start of nebulisation. During 
this period redistribution of the radiolabelled liposomes may have occurred. 
The time-dependent retention curve of radiolabelled liposomes was biphasic. There was an initial rapid 
reduction in counts over 3 h followed by a slower phase up to 48 h. Mean retention of radiolabelled 
liposomes within the lung at 48 h was 41.8% (45.3% vs. 38.3% for the two subgroups described above). 
Model-based simulations showed that peak (Cmax) and trough concentrations were not impacted 
markedly with changes in BMI or lung function. 
Table 5: Summary of pulmonary retention of radiolabelled liposomes 
Figure 2: Plot to show the pulmonary clearance of radiolabelled liposomes 
The Phase 2 study TR02-112 in NTM patients included a scintigraphy sub-study in 4 patients who 
completed the 3-month randomised phase. These patients received a single dose of 99Tc-radiolabelled 
ALIS 590 mg via an eFlow® nebuliser on Day 1 at NIAID and then underwent gamma scintigraphy during 
the first 2 minutes of each 10-minute period over 2 h to determine initial drug deposition and clearance 
rates. An additional drug retention scan was performed 18-30 h following initial study drug inhalation on 
Day 2. On Study Day 3 they began administration of ALIS 590 mg for up to 84 days.

Almost half (42.8% ± 5.6%) of the loaded dose was deposited in the lungs immediately after dosing, 
corresponding to 252 mg of 99Tc-ALIS. Only 12.8% ± 5.4% of the loaded dose was retained in the 
nebuliser. The C/P ratio of 2.05 indicated that twice as much radiolabelled ALIS was deposited in the lung 
centrally as compared to peripherally. Retention of the radiolabelled ALIS over time was 79% ± 7% at 1 
h and 53% ± 3% at 24 h so more than half was retained in the lung at 24 h and the radiolabel was 
distributed to both central and peripheral compartments of the lung. Deposition of radiolabel in areas of 
cavitation and air trapping was not apparent. 
Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) 
The ratio (w/w) of DPPC to amikacin in ALIS is 1.0. For the nominal 500 mg loaded dose, approximately 
112.5 mg amikacin and 112.5 mg of DPPC are delivered to the lungs, taking into account the efficiency of 
the delivery by inhalation. For a 50 kg adult, this corresponds to a delivered dose of DPPC of 2.25 mg/kg 
and ~ 53 mg of DPPC per dose deposited in the alveoli. This is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less than the 
50-100 mg/kg doses of exogenous lung surfactants that have been instilled into neonate and adult lungs 
in the treatment of ARDS.  
Liposomes deposited in the conducting airways are cleared by the mucociliary escalator, and are not 
expected to contribute to the endogenous phospholipid pool. Martini et al. have shown that DPPC is 
recycled into lamellar bodies of alveolar type II cells at a rate of 216 nmol/h/g tissue in ventilated pigs. For 
a 400 g human lung this corresponds to a basal absorption rate for DPPC of about 70 mg/h. Hence, the 
phospholipid dose delivered from ALIS can be easily cleared and recycled using existing metabolic 
pathways. Moreover, the rate of catabolism of DPPC accelerates at higher lipid loads. Surfactant 
treatments have been shown not to adversely affect endogenous synthetic and secretory phospholipids 
pathways by feedback inhibition. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients 
Serum amikacin AUC0-24 during QD inhalation of ALIS by CF patients was much lower than reported after 
30-35 mg/kg amikacin IV QD in CF patients. The mean steady-state serum AUC0-24 estimates (see below) 
were 13.7 to 23.3-fold lower for ALIS compared to IV amikacin.  
In contrast, ALIS resulted in markedly higher concentrations of amikacin in sputum (several 
thousand-fold higher than those achievable on dosing with amikacin IV).  
Bronchiectatic patients 
Similar findings applied to the comparison between patients with bronchiectasis complicated with chronic 
P. aeruginosa infection treated with ALIS vs. published data after intravenous dosing.

Observed data 
In TR02-112 blood was collected from a subset of 14 patients with frequent sampling in two time windows 
to capture pre- and post-dose serum levels on Days 1, 2, 28, 56, 84, 112 and 168. Sputum and urine were 
also obtained. Serum amikacin showed an early peak at up to 6 mg/L but levels by 12 h were generally < 
1 mg/L. 
Sputum concentrations were much more variable and some subjects had very high concentrations during 
12-24 h post-dose.

The Phase 3 study INS-212 included collection of blood and sputum samples from a subset of US and 
Japanese patients between 0 to 1 h pre-dose and 1 to 4 h post-dose at months 1, 3 and 6 on treatment. 
A sputum-only subset had samples collected to assess residual concentrations after interrupting/stopping 
ALIS at various time points, including 28 days and 3 months off-treatment.  
Intensive blood sampling occurred in a subset of Japanese subjects. Of 39 patients providing PK data, 11 
were from the US and 28 Japanese. The serum PK data are shown and compared below for TR02-112 and 
INS-212, the latter indicating that serum amikacin was still measurable after 72 h.  
Population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) analysis of TR02-112 and INS-212 
The PK data (collected as described above) from these studies in patients with NTM were used to conduct 
two POPPK analyses. 
1- was performed on the data available from TR02-112 and data available from INS-212 when patients 
had completed the 6-month visit. 
2 - was performed when patients had completed the follow-up visit at 6 months off-treatment. The serum 
PK data and thus the POPPK analyses of 1 and 2 are identical. A small amount of additional sputum data 
was added.

Candidate PK models were fit to serum concentration and urine amount data simultaneously using Monte 
Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization, as implemented in the open-source software S-ADAPT 
Version 1.57. In general, the structural POPPK model was not planned to be modified from that which was 
applied to the data from TR02-112 alone due to the relative sparseness of the serum PK sampling scheme 
in INS-212. This model had been previously developed using data from CF studies. This was a 
three-compartment model absorptive lung compartment, serum compartment and urine compartment) 
with linear clearance. Random inter-occasion variability was not estimated on any of the PK parameters. 
A formal covariate evaluation was not performed but screening plots were conducted using predicted 
amikacin exposures. No significant relationships were evident in these plots. However, the relationship 
between body weight and renal clearance, which had been previously identified, was included as a 
covariate in the model. 
Individual estimates of amikacin AUC0-24 and Cmax on Day 1 and at steady state were generated for each 
patient using individual PK parameter estimates from the fit of the model. Additionally, 
non-compartmental estimation of AUC0-24 and Cmax was conducted for INS-212 patients in the PK 
sub-study. The non-compartmental estimates were then compared to those derived from the POPPK 
model to assess the robustness of the model. 
The model used data from 14 and 39 patients in the two studies, providing 111 sera (16 were BLQ) and 
23 urine samples from TR02-112 and 307 sera in INS-212. Sputum samples were available from 59 
patients. The model that had been developed using data from CF studies and TR02-112 provided an 
adequate fit to the pooled data from NTM patients. The model parameter estimates are shown below.

The comparison of the individual estimates for AUC0-24 and Cmax derived from the POPPK model vs. 
non-compartmental estimates are shown below. There was reasonable congruence in the AUC0-24 
estimates by the two methods but those derived from the POPPK model were higher. The applicant 
ascribes this to the relatively sparse sampling scheme, which tends to result in AUC0-24 estimates that are 
biased low when calculated by non-compartmental methods.

comprehensive PK subset) administered 590 mg ALIS once daily 
The exposure estimates determined using the POPPK model are shown below by study. The results 
indicate consistent serum exposures in the two studies. Systemic bioavailability could not be estimated in 
INS-212 due to lack of urine samples.

The applicant considered that the comparability in systemic exposures between the two studies indicates 
that the systemic bioavailability of amikacin after ALIS administration was also comparable. Thus, it was 
concluded that less than 10% of the inhaled dose reached the systemic circulation.  
Table 7: Summary statistics of the amikacin serum half-life and exposure estimates on  
Day 1 and at steady-state 
Initially, the applicant compared blood levels between NTM/MAC patients treated with ALIS and CF 
patients treated with IV amikacin at 30 or 35 mg/kg as shown below, which suggested ~10-fold lower 
AUCs. To further assess systemic bioavailability when treating MAC NTM patients with ALIS, a comparison 
was made from the ALIS POPPK estimates for NTM patients with serum AUCs when administering amikacin 
to non-CF and non-burns patients at IV doses from 15 to 30 mg/kg. As shown below, a >10-fold 
difference was observed.

Further analyses investigated the possible worst-case scenarios for steady-state AUC0-24 and Cmax 
derived from the individual post hoc exposure estimates from subjects with NTM, all of whom had CrCL 
>50 mL/min. Even when using the maximum estimated AUC0-24 at steady-state from the NTM studies 
and the conservative AUC0-24  observed in CF patients from the literature as the worst-case exposure 
scenario, systemic amikacin exposure was predicted to be 4-fold lower after ALIS vs. IV amikacin.

The proportion of subjects predicted to have steady-state AUC0-24 > 40 mg•h/L after daily administration 
of ALIS is 7.5% based on individual estimates. Using Monte Carlo simulation and the population mean and 
inter-individual (IIV) variability estimates for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) from the population PK 
model, 12.2% of NTM subjects receiving ALIS 590 mg QD would be predicted to have a steady-state 
AUC0-24  above 40. Furthermore, the potential impact of severe renal impairment on exposure to ALIS 
was estimated and gave a distribution as shown in the figure.

Figure 5: Distribution of predicted steady-state AUC0-24 estimates in hypothetical patients 
with severe renal impairment assuming a direct, linear relationship between amikacin CL/F 
and CLcr 
Since a relatively shallow relationship was found between CL/F and CrCL using the individual estimates 
from the population PK analysis, fewer subjects would be expected to experience exposures similar to that 
which have been reported for patients receiving systemic amikacin. Under the worst case scenarios 
detailed above, systemic amikacin exposure after ALIS administration is still expected to be well below 
that which is experienced by patients receiving amikacin via IV or IM administration. 
Elimination 
Aminoglycosides are not significantly metabolised, undergo glomerular filtration and are actively 
resorbed in the proximal kidney tubules. 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
In POPPK analyses conducted by the applicant creatinine clearance was evaluated as a covariate for a 
relationship with the inter-individual variability in amikacin PK and was not found to be significant. 
Arikayce was not studied in patients with renal impairment and dose adjustments were not employed in 
clinical studies due to the low systemic bioavailability. The median (range) creatinine clearance in patients 
with NTM was 86.3 (63.3 to 140) mL/min/1.73 m2 in TR02-112 and 88.4 (57.4 to 124) mL/min/1.73 m2 
in INS-212. The median AUC0-24 (μg•h/mL) was 17.8 in TR02-112 and 15.8 in INS-212. See above 
regarding estimated worst-case exposures in severe renal impairment.  
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
Due to the fact that amikacin is not metabolised and has low protein binding the PK of amikacin after ALIS 
inhalation is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. 
• 
Other factors 
There were 45 female and 8 male patients with NTM/MAC that provided PK data. In the POPPK analyses 
there were no significant relationships between amikacin PK and gender and amikacin exposure was 
similar in Japanese and White patients.  
The age range for CF patients was 6 to 68 years and that for NTM patients was 20 to 84. While the PK of 
ALIS has not been specifically studied in the elderly, there were 23 NTM patients 65 years of age or older 
studied in the PK analyses. Age was used and evaluated as a covariate in the POPPK analyses and was 
found to be not significant. Based on available data, there was no clear relationship between age and the 
systemic PK parameters of amikacin in each age subgroup and there was a nearly complete overlap seen 
in the distributions of the PK parameters.

The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides, i.e. it binds to 
bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding and tRNA acceptor sites. This leads to 
disruption of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides. Other actions 
have been postulated for drugs of this class. 
In most types of bacteria, resistance to amikacin may reflect production of certain 
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs; although amikacin is less affected by some AMEs than other 
licensed agents in the class), the presence of ribosomal methyltransferases that block drug binding, efflux 
pumps and porin deficiencies. It is unknown whether any of these mechanisms of resistance has an 
impact on the efficacy of inhaled aminoglycosides. No scientifically sound susceptibility testing 
interpretive criteria that is applicable to inhalational administration of amikacin can be derived. 
Mycobacterial resistance to aminoglycosides has been studied mostly in M. tuberculosis (MTB). The 
mycobacterial cell wall constitutes an intrinsic mechanism of resistance due to its low degree of 
permeability, in particular for large polycationic molecules such as aminoglycosides. In addition, the 
presence of chromosomally encoded AME among mycobacterial species plays a role in decreased

susceptibility and, along with the cell wall, the variation in susceptibility to aminoglycosides between 
mycobacterial species. 
The primary mechanism of acquired resistance to aminoglycosides in mycobacteria is mutation of rrn at 
key binding sites of the 16S rRNA target. Due to the single copy of the rrn operon in MAC, M. abscessus 
and MTB, resistance to aminoglycosides via this mechanism is more common than in other Gram-positive 
and Gram-negative bacteria where there are typically multiple copies. The most common mutation is 
A1401G (MTB corresponds to the A1408 residue of Escherichia coli) or A1408G (MAC and M. abscessus), 
which is one of the primary contact points for aminoglycoside binding to the A site of 16S rRNA. Several 
other mechanisms of resistance have been found to impact on the susceptibility of MTB to streptomycin 
but not to amikacin. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The applicant summarised 8 studies that report on the activity of amikacin against MAC. Two studies were 
conducted in accordance with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) method and tested MAC isolates from 
the US and Sweden. In both studies the amikacin MIC50 was 16 μg/mL and the MIC90 was 32 μg/mL. 
Isolates with amikacin MIC values > 64 μg/mL were rare (2.2% and 0.9%, respectively).

Other studies that used the CLSI BMD method reported similar MIC50 and MIC90 values against M. 
intracellulare and M. avium from China and against M. intracellulare from Taiwan. The activity of amikacin 
reported in the literature against NTM other than MAC generally gives MIC50 of 0.25 to 8 μg/mL and MIC90 
of 2 to 32 μg/mL with the exception of M. chelonae (> 64 μg/mL). 
In a study of 5 M. avium isolates and 4 MTB isolates, amikacin had MBCs of 16 to 128 μg/mL and 0.5 to 
2 μg/mL, respectively. There was 99.9% kill with amikacin at high concentrations for M. avium. In a 
separate study, the killing observed with amikacin against single isolates of M. avium and M. xenopi was 
apparent at 4-fold to 32-fold the MIC and there was typically regrowth of M. avium observed between 120 
and 240 h post-inoculation, suggesting the presence of persisters or the development of resistance (see 
below). Furthermore, in a time-kill study with M avium 101 (serovar 1), the killing observed with amikacin 
was rapid but there was some evidence of regrowth in the presence of amikacin at < 16 μg/mL between 
Days 10-21. 
Figure 7: Time-kill of amikacin against M avium IWGMT49 
In contrast, there have been reports of the lack of bactericidal activity for amikacin against M. abscessus 
linked to the chromosomal expression of AME.  
In an in-vitro study conducted by Oregon State University ALIS (70 mg/mL amikacin in liposomes [2:1 
molar ratio of DPPC to cholesterol at a total lipid concentration of 40 mg/mL] in 1.5% NaCl) and placebo 
liposomes were evaluated for bactericidal activity against 3 M. avium and 2 M. abscessus isolates 
internalised within THP-1 human macrophages. ALIS was diluted so that, over the 4-day test period, the 
daily concentration ranged from 1 to 10 μg/mL. Free amikacin at 10 μg/mL was administered as a control. 
A standardised dispersion of 3 × 108 CFU/mL of each mycobacterial isolate was made. On day 5 the cells 
were lysed and colony counts were performed. Empty liposomes gave counts very similar to those for 
untreated cells.  
Significantly fewer mycobacteria were recovered at Day 4 for ALIS at 2, 4, 8 and 10 μg/mL and for free 
amikacin at 10 μg/mL for all evaluated isolates relative to controls and empty liposome controls. ALIS at 
4-10 µg/mL amikacin killed or inhibited growth of the three M. avium strains and was more bactericidal 
against each strain (1.5-fold, 2.1-fold and 5.7-fold) than free amikacin at 10 µg/mL. 
In an in-vivo study conducted by Oregon State University, six groups of 12 female mice were infected 
nasally with M. avium strain 104 (~2x107 CFU) on day 0. After 3 weeks the control mice lungs were

harvested, homogenised and plated on agar to determine the mean CFU (~0.7 x 105) after which dosing 
of remaining mice was as follows: 
Group 1 - 28 QD doses over 1 h of 1.5% saline 
Group 2 - 28 QD doses over 1 h of ALIS 74 mg/kg  
(no ALIS) 
(total 2128 mg/kg) 
Group 3 - 14 QD doses over 2 h of ALIS 152 mg/kg; then 14 days off drug  
(total 2128 mg/kg) 
Group 4 - 14 doses every other day over 2 h of ALIS 152 mg/kg  
Group 5 - 28 QD doses of intraperitoneal amikacin 100 mg/kg  
(total 2128 mg/kg) 
(total 2800 mg/kg) 
Aerosols of ALIS (Groups 2-4) and 1.5% Saline (Group 1) were administered using 12-port nose-only 
inhalation chambers. On Day 50 lungs were harvested from Groups 1-5.  
ALIS 76 mg/kg QD for 28 days significantly (p = 0.0002) reduced the M. avium burden in the lungs vs. 
controls in Group 1. There were also significant reductions vs. controls in M. avium/lung (p < 0.0001) in 
mice treated with inhalation either every other day for 28 days or for 14 consecutive days. All ALIS groups 
had a numerically greater reduction in mean CFU/lung vs. Group 5 (intraperitoneal amikacin).

Arikace and Intraperitoneal injections of amikacin. The symbols represent the Log10CFU/lungs of 
each mouse 50 days after the instillation of M. avium. The horizontal lines and vertical lines represent the 
means and standard deviations that were calculated using Excel software by Microsoft. The numerical 
means and standard deviations are above each group’s symbols. 
From the time of initiation of treatment to the end of the study the ALIS regimens eliminated 99.5% of M. 
avium while parenteral amikacin eliminated 88% and 1.5 % saline eliminated 43%. The number of 
bacteria eliminated was significantly different between the saline group and Groups 2-5 but there was no 
statistically significant difference among active treatment groups. The rate of complete eradication of M. 
avium was the highest in Group 4 (42%) and lowest in Group 5 (25%).  
Secondary pharmacology 
The secondary pharmacodynamic effects centre on the effects of inhalation of liposomal amikacin on 
pulmonary function tests. In the NTM/MAC studies, these data are considered most important for the 
assessment of safety. However, they are described in section 2.5 (Clinical Efficacy) along with the 
microbiological and other clinical endpoints.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
In-vitro drug combination studies relevant to inhalation of ALIS have not been conducted. Numerous 
published studies, however, have evaluated the combined antimycobacterial effect of amikacin and other 
agents used to treat Mycobacterial infections and have shown lack of antagonism.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The applicant did not attempt PK-PD analyses using the data from the NTM/MAC clinical studies. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Systemic bioavailability of amikacin after ALIS inhalation 
Since the pharmacokinetics of amikacin after systemic administration are well known, the most important 
consideration for Arikayce is the estimated worst-case systemic exposure to amikacin after daily 
inhalations in comparison with that typically observed during IV dosing of non-CF patients.  
Given the high degree to which amikacin is excreted by glomerular filtration, the percentage of a dose 
which is eliminated in the urine is expected to be a reliable surrogate for the bioavailability of amikacin 
after administration of ALIS. In the previous application, the amount of amikacin excreted in the urine 
over 24 h post-dose correlated with serum AUC0-24. There were modest increases in serum Cmax and AUC 
values between days 1 and 14 of ALIS inhalations and measurable serum amikacin levels at 72 h 
post-dose that would not be expected based on the short half-life in blood after IV administration. This 
finding may reflect several factors, including slow release of amikacin from liposomes in the airways.  
The POPPK analysis concluded that serum exposure to amikacin in patients with MAC in INS-212 was 
consistent with that seen in the patients with NTM in TR02-112. It was not possible to estimate systemic 
bioavailability in INS-212 as urine samples for determination of amikacin amount excreted were not 
collected. However, the comparable systemic exposures between the two studies suggest that systemic 
bioavailability of amikacin is also comparable between study populations.  
The mean steady-state AUC0-24 in the NTM patients in TR02-112, with a similar value in INS-212 (about 
20 mg.h/L), was ~10 times lower than the mean AUC0-24 reported in the literature for patients with CF 
given amikacin 30 mg/kg IV once daily (20.8 µg.h/mL compared with 235 µg.h/mL, respectively). An 
additional comparison was made with typical AUCs observed when dosing amikacin in non-CF patients at 
doses from 15-30 mg/kg. This indicated a >10-fold difference in mean AUCs for ALIS vs. systemic 
amikacin. However, worst-case scenario analyses that took into account the wide range of inter-individual 
variability is serum amikacin levels indicated that systemic exposures in patients with severe renal 
impairment who receive Arikayce could overlap with those observed with IV amikacin in patients with 
normal renal function. On this basis, and with no clinical data available, use of Arikayce should be 
contraindicated in NTM patients with severe renal failure. For all patients other than those with severe 
impairment, and whether or not they have pre-existing mild or moderate renal impairment, there is advice 
to conduct regular monitoring of renal function in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Sputum concentrations (µg/mL or µg/g sputum) and residual antibacterial activity  
There was very considerable variability in sputum concentrations of amikacin, even more so than was 
observed for serum levels. In TR02-112, sputum concentrations were measured in 16 patients and data 
from 4 were excluded, in 3 cases due to amikacin detected in pre-dose samples while receiving placebo. 
Prior investigations indicated that these patients had a history of treatment with nebulised amikacin 
(using the IV formulation) prior to study and/or were possibly still receiving such treatment on study in 
violation of the protocol. Previous questions and responses also examined likely mix-ups between 
samples. In the responses it became clear that of the remaining 12 retained in the analysis, 6 patients 
were randomised to placebo. Pre-dose samples (i.e. 24h post-dose) showed concentrations that ranged 
from 0.78 to 7080 µg/mL in the samples with quantifiable levels.  
In INS-212, patients assigned to ALIS were to interrupt treatment 2 days before each visit so the sputum 
collected during the visit would have been obtained up to 72 h after the last dose. Amikacin concentration 
data were available from 59 patients and were highly variable. Overall, the sputum concentrations are 
considered not to provide a reliable estimation of amikacin concentrations in the airways. Their 
importance is with regard to understanding whether residual amikacin in samples that took up to 72 h to 
reach central laboratories could have impacted on the reported bacterial loads, including the risk of false 
negative cultures. To address this possibility, the applicant conducted an in-vitro study to assess whether 
on-treatment sputum culture results were significantly affected by carryover of residual amikacin.  
This study employed incubation of sputa spiked with MAC at two similar load levels with non-liposomal 
amikacin at a maximum of 128 µg/mL. Therefore, although this study suggested no important effect of 
exposing MAC in sputa to amikacin for up to 72 h before processing for culture, the study does not mimic 
the application of liposomal amikacin nor does it cover the high concentrations observed in sputa even 
after 72 h in some individuals. Thus, whilst the majority of ALIS and non-ALIS patients failed to achieve 
SCC by month 6 in INS-212, it remains possible that not all patients considered to have achieved SCC on 
treatment really did so. 
Loaded dose equivalent to amikacin 
There was a difference in delivered volume on switching from 2x5-mL vials to 1x10-mL vial during the 
clinical programme. For the development of the 10-mL vial, a laboratory study was conducted to 
determine the fill required in order to deliver an 8 mL loaded dose of ALIS, equivalent to 560 mg of 
amikacin, to a nebuliser, taking into account residual drug. This study concluded that a target fill of 9.3 g 
(equivalent to 8.9 mL based on an average density of 1.05 mg/mL) would assure delivery of a loaded dose 
of 8 mL of ALIS. An interim analysis of the release data for 24 batches of ALIS manufactured and filled in 
10-mL vials for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials revealed that an average of 8.43 mL (equivalent to 590 mg of 
amikacin) was being delivered to the nebuliser instead of 8 mL. Therefore, the SmPC states that Arikayce 
10-mL vials provide 590 mg ALIS for loading the nebuliser. 
Lung distribution 
The lung distribution study did not compare liposomal with non-liposomal amikacin, which would have 
been informative re the possible benefit of the liposomal formulation.  
Based on the measured fraction of the loaded dose retained within the nebuliser (mean 61.2%) and the 
fraction of the emitted dose delivered to lungs, it was calculated that 15.5% of the loaded dose was 
deposited in lungs. If this estimate from healthy subjects can be applied to patients with NTM, and if the 
estimated serum bioavailability based on urinary excretion data is correct, then some patients must 
absorb a large proportion of the amikacin that finally reaches the lungs. If bioavailability were to be 
expressed relative to the amount deposited into the lungs, the estimate would be approximately 78% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 50/109 
 
 
 
healthy adult volunteers using the PARI Nebuliser. This was calculated based on: 590 mg x 12% = 70.8 
mg absorbed systemically; 590 mg x 15.5% = 91.5 mg deposited in lungs; bioavailability = 70.8 mg / 
91.5 mg x 100% = 78% of deposited dose in healthy adults. 
The data from the small scintigraphy sub-study of TR02-112 demonstrated that a higher proportion of the 
loaded dose is deposited in the lung of patients with NTM lung disease (approximately 43%) using the 
PARI eflow Electronic Nebuliser (using the electronic vibrating mesh). Applying the calculation method 
above, 27.9% of deposited drug in the lung is absorbed systemically in patients with NTM lung disease 
using the eflow device. This was calculated based on: 590 mg x 12% = 70.8 mg absorbed systemically; 
590 mg x 43% = 253.7 mg deposited in lungs; bioavailability = 70.8 mg / 253.7 mg x 100% = 27.9% of 
deposited dose in patients with NTM lung disease. Whilst the estimate of 12% of a dose reaching serum 
was based solely on data from CF patients, the data from TR02-112 suggested that 10% or less of a dose 
is absorbed after inhalation by NTM patients. Taking the mean to be 8%, the revised calculation would 
give 47.2 mg absorbed, so bioavailability would be 47.2/253.7, which suggests that only ~19% of the 
dose deposited in the airways reaches the serum. 
Fate of amikacin 
In the lung distribution study, only the amikacin was radiolabelled. The report repeatedly refers to 
radiolabelled liposome deposition and clearance, but such statements assume that the radiolabelled 
amikacin remained associated with the liposomal material. This assumption conflicts with the proposed 
leakage of the active substance from the liposomes and it does not consider the proportion of the inhaled 
amikacin dose that is free drug. 
The study showed that the radiolabel in lungs decreased rapidly initially (3 h) and then slowly over 48 h 
(beyond which accurate determinations are not possible due to the short half-life of the radioisotope) at 
which time 42% of the deposited dose was retained in the lung. Whilst it is not entirely clear how this 
fraction was calculated (the CSR being very unclear on several matters and with lack of clarity regarding 
exactly which fraction of what is referred to) the table and figure suggest that there is some initial rapid 
clearance by mechanical means and/or systemic absorption and then a slow clearance of amikacin. The 
pattern of decay described fits with the data on persistence of residual amikacin in pre-dose sputa. 
Unfortunately, this study did not assay radiolabel in blood, which would have assisted in confirming the 
estimates of systemic bioavailability based on urinary amikacin levels. 
Once amikacin has been released from the liposomes there is no reason to expect that its fate differs in 
any way from that of amikacin after parenteral dosing. Due to the longstanding use of amikacin and the 
time of initial development it was never studied as would now be expected (e.g. in terms of full appraisal 
of interactions with transporters). However, it is freely filtered across the glomerulus and most is then 
excreted. However, ~5 to 10 % of the parenteral dose is taken up and sequestered by the proximal tubule 
cells (PTCs), where concentrations may greatly exceed concurrent serum concentrations. 
Due to the cationic charge at physiologic pH, amikacin binds to anion phospholipids within the plasma 
membrane of the PTC in a saturable, electrostatic manner. It is then transferred to the transmembrane 
protein megalin, which mediates endocytosis. The endosomes containing amikacin are transported to the 
Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, where drug accumulates in subcellular organelles such 
as the mitochondria and the nucleus. Other than the above, which is widely recognised to apply to all 
aminoglycosides, there is a lack of data on interactions between amikacin and transporters.

Fate of the liposomal material 
During the prior procedure, the applicant was requested to review relevant literature and to assess any 
possible problems with DPPC inhalation over several years. DPPC is an excipient in exogenous lung 
surfactants but it is an endogenous material that occurs as a monolayer at the air-water interface. The 
lung recycles exogenous DPPC in addition to its own endogenous production. 
The applicant estimated that the amount of DPPC deposited in the lung after a dose of ALIS is ~43 mg 
based on the following calculation and assumptions: 
o  15.5% Deposition  
o  0.7:1 lipid to drug weight ratio 
2:1 DPPC to cholesterol weight ratio 
Leading to the calculation of 590 mg x 0.155 x 0.7 x 0.67 = 42.9 mg 
As the turnover rate of DPPC in the lung is ~29 mg/hour (as reported by Martini, 1999), the DPPC is 
expected to be recycled within 60 - 90 minutes after dosing.   
The applicant conducted a literature search for publications on inhalation of DPPC. Additional reviews on 
the toxicity of DPPC were identified from the lists of references in the publications found. Most of the 
reference papers found were not specific to the evaluation of DPPC toxicity (short- or long-term) in 
non-clinical or clinical studies. In summary, there was very limited information obtained from the review 
of the relevant literature to assess possible problems with DPPC inhalation over several years. However, 
there were no reports of serious adverse events associated with DPPC. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The microbiological data from the clinical studies in NTM/MAC patients are considered in the discussion of 
efficacy along with discussion of the microbiological methods applied during the efficacy trials. 
The applicant has conducted very few studies to document the possible advantages of using liposomal 
ALIS rather than inhaling amikacin itself. Nevertheless, additional nonclinical studies are not likely to help 
and are not requested or encouraged at this stage of development. Furthermore, PK-PD analyses have 
not been conducted since no PDT can be established that is relevant to inhaled therapy and due to the 
small numbers of patients providing PK data. However, no relationship between serum or sputum 
amikacin and sustained SCC rates would be expected. 
Very high MICs of amikacin have been documented for some NTM or, at least, for a subset of strains 
within specific species. For example, very high MICs have been linked to 16S RNA mutations in M. 
abscessus and M. avium complex and to cellular impermeability coupled with AME production in M. 
abscessus. TR02-112 enrolled a minority of patients infected with M. abscessus some of whom also had 
CF. The available data did suggest that any benefit of ALIS was likely confined to MAC but this finding does 
not inevitably lead to a conclusion that the MIC of amikacin is of relevance to the clinical response to 
inhaled therapy.  
The applicant chose to impose a restriction on the amikacin MIC for baseline MAC in INS-212 (≤ 64 mg/L) 
based on the CLSI susceptibility test interpretive criteria relevant to parenteral amikacin usage when 
treating MAC. There was no relationship found between SCC and MIC (see the discussion of efficacy) in 
the Arikayce studies and there is no known rationale for recommending that ALIS is used to treat MAC 
only when the MIC is ≤ 64 mg/L simply because this restriction was applied in clinical studies. 
Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that it has not been established whether acquired resistance to 
amikacin (based on susceptibility criteria applicable to systemic use) in MAC can be overcome by very 
high local concentrations achievable after inhalation. There is, however, considerable evidence from CF 
patients colonised with P. aeruginosa to indicate that PFTs are maintained or even improved regardless of 
MIC of the agent(s) being inhaled.

Mutations in the rrs gene of the rrn operon resulting in changes to 16S rRNA that interfere with the 
binding of aminoglycosides to the A site of the ribosome are the most common aminoglycoside resistance 
mechanism in mycobacteria. Most mycobacteria have a single copy of the rrn operon 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no Major Objections regarding clinical pharmacology. It should be noted that several issues 
were addressed in the previous application that, if not wholly resolved, were considered not worth 
pursuing. The most important issue is the estimated worst-case serum amikacin levels that may occur 
taking into account the additional PK data obtained from INS-212 and the updated POPPK model. In some 
NTM patients, these can be expected to overlap with AUCs associated with IV dosing. The final SmPC has 
been modified to reflect the concerns, including contraindicating use in patients with severe renal 
impairment. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
There were 3 studies that enrolled patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.  
TR02-112 enrolled patients with chronic NTM lung infections, including but not confined to MAC. This 
study was submitted and fully assessed in the prior MAA. The newly reported Phase 3 trial INS-212 
enrolled non-CF patients with chronic MAC lung infections. INS-312 enrolled patients who failed to 
achieve SCC or relapsed in INS-212 and opted to receive open label Arikayce.   
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There were two dose-finding studies in CF patients colonised with P. aeruginosa that used the 70 mg/mL 
formulation. TR02-106, which compared doses of 70 mg, 140 mg or 560 mg QD, failed to show a 
significant difference for any ALIS dose group vs. placebo for mean relative change in pre-dose FEV1 from 
baseline to day 28 or day 56. TR02-105 did provide some evidence of a dose-response. Taking into 
account the safety data in CF patients and in NTM patients in TR02-112, the applicant selected the highest 
dose (later found to be equivalent to 590 mg and not 560 mg) for the Phase 3 MAC study.

The final CSR dated 9 October 2019 was submitted on Day 121. 
INS-212 was initiated in May 2015 and all patients had reached the 12-month safety follow-up visit 
on 3 April 2019 or had previously discontinued.  
The initial CSR in the MAA included the 3-month off-treatment analysis (this is the EU-recommended 
primary endpoint as per the last CHMP scientific advice; these data were not available to the US FDA 
when they approved Arikayce). 
In the initial CSR, data were incomplete for the month 12 post-treatment visit. The applicant notified 
the CHMP that all data for this last visit could be supplied when responding to the D120 LoQ. 
The overall study design is shown in the figure below.

Active pulmonary disease other than MAC 
Known hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides 
Use of inhaled or systemic aminoglycosides with activity against MAC in 28 days before baseline  
Acquired and primary immunodeficiency syndromes or HIV-positive  
Treatments 
Patients were to continue the same multidrug (MDR) regimen of at least 2 agents in accordance with the 
2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines or local guidelines. Patients were not to change the MDR regimen during the 
treatment phase except for safety concerns or if rescue therapy was required, in which case they 
discontinued and were treated as non-converters in the primary analysis.  
Patients with SCC by month 6 were to complete a treatment course of 12 months, starting from the first 
of 3 negative cultures that defined SCC. Patients who achieved SCC and completed treatment stopped all 
MAC treatment (not just ALIS) at the EOT visit. All non-converters and those with relapse or recurrence 
by the month 6 visit were discontinued at month 8 and offered ALIS in INS-312 
ALIS 590 mg QD (70 mg/mL amikacin in 10mL water for injection) was administered via an eFlow 
nebuliser over ~ 14 minutes at home except for the 2 days prior to a scheduled study visit when sputum 
was collected. On the day of a study visit, treatment was given after sputum collection. ALIS could be 
interrupted in case of local respiratory events and reintroduced when symptoms subsided.  
No other inhaled antibacterial agents or any aminoglycosides with activity against MAC were allowed from 
28 days before baseline and throughout the study unless clinically indicated. If inhaled treatment was 
needed, ALIS was interrupted until the acute event had resolved. Inhaled tobramycin does not have 
activity against MAC and was permitted. Systemic antibacterial agents without activity against MAC could 
be used if necessary. Bronchodilator therapy was allowed and patients who developed bronchospasm 
were permitted to be pre-treated with a bronchodilator before ALIS dosing.   
Objectives 
In the protocol, the primary objective was to evaluate the SCC rate (3 consecutive monthly negative 
sputum cultures) by month 6 for ALIS + MDR vs. MDR alone. The date of conversion was the date of the 
first of 3 negative cultures. Following CHMP scientific advice, the primary endpoint for the EU submission 
was to be sustained SCC assessed at least 3 months after the end of all MAC treatment (i.e. negative 
sputum culture after 3 months off-treatment without intervening relapse or reinfection). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Sputum specimens (with or without induction) were collected at screening, baseline, at months 1-6, 
months 8 and 12, at EOT and at the off-treatment safety follow-up visits at months 1, 3, 6 and 12. 
Sputum specimens were cultured in broth media in addition to agar media. If results were negative on 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 55/109 
 
 
 
 
agar, the broth media was held for 6 weeks before being reported as culture negative. Standard 
sensitivity testing to determine MICs was performed in accordance with CLSI M48-A and NCCLS M24-A 
and isolates were stored for selective molecular typing. Isolates of MAC were identified to complex, using 
a commercial RNA probe and identified to sub-species (M. avium, M. intracellulare, MAC “X” group) using 
molecular methodology. 
SCC by month 6 
During the procedure, the applicant clarified that for a patient to be declared culture negative at any one 
visit, whether on-treatment or off-treatment, all cultures collected for that visit were required to be 
negative for MAC, regardless of agar or broth media. Thus, if 3 sputum samples were collected for a visit, 
all 3 agar media and all 3 broth media cultures must have been declared negative for MAC in order for that 
visit to be declared culture negative. A single broth positive sample would disqualify a visit from being 
declared culture negative. For a patient to meet the definition of culture conversion by month 6, there 
must have been 3 consecutive monthly MAC negative sputum cultures (i.e. up to 9 samples, all negative 
by culture on agar and in broth media).  
To have achieved SCC by month 6, and thus stay on study after month 8 (when the month 6 culture 
results would be available), the latest visit at which SCC could have first occurred was month 4. If a 
patient was unable to produce sputum despite reasonable efforts, and had already met the definition of 
culture conversion, this was recorded as a negative culture result. All non-converters and those with 
relapse or recurrence as assessed by the month 6 visit (see below) were discontinued at month 8 and 
offered ALIS in INS-312.  
Sustained SCC 
Culture conversion was considered “sustained” if there were no positive agar media and no more than 2 
consecutive positive monthly broth media for MAC from conversion through an additional 12 months of 
treatment, after which all treatment for MAC lung infection was stopped. Culture conversion was 
considered sustained at each follow-up visit if the conversion had been maintained up to and including 
that visit. Patients that had any positive agar media culture after conversion or had at least 3 consecutive 
positive monthly broth media cultures at any time after conversion while on treatment were considered to 
not have achieved sustained culture conversion. If a subject was unable to produce sputum despite 
reasonable efforts, and had already met the definition of culture conversion, this was recorded as a 
negative culture result at that time point.  
Relapse/recurrence 
Relapse or recurrence was defined as having MAC-positive sputum cultures in broth media (agar 
negative) for 3 or more consecutive months or having at least 1 MAC-positive sputum culture on agar 
media (agar positive) after SCC. Relapse was defined as a positive culture after SCC that was the same 
species and genotype (copy number and allele number) as that isolated at Screening/Baseline. 
Recurrence was defined as a positive culture after SCC that was either a different species than that 
isolated at Screening/Baseline or the same species but different genotype (different copy number and/or 
allele number) than that isolated at Screening/Baseline.  
Completers and non-completers 
Completers were either 1) converters by month 6 who successfully completed their treatment regimen or 
2) non-converters by month 6 who successfully completed all dosing and protocol requirements up to and 
including the month 6 study visit. All other patients were non-completers. 
Other endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020  
Page 56/109 
 
 
 
 
 
A 6MWT of exertional capability was performed at baseline, at months 4, 6 and 8, at EOT and at the 3 
months off-treatment safety follow-up visit. A standardised protocol based on the ATS guidelines was 
used. The 6MWT was conducted by a site member blinded to treatment assignment.  
The SGRQ and the EQ-5D-3L were completed at baseline, at months 3, 6, 8 and 12, and EOT and the 3 
months off-treatment safety follow-up visit. 
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) of FEV1, FEF (25-75%) and FVC were performed at sites with access to 
spirometers and trained personnel at baseline, month 6 and at the 6 months off-treatment safety 
follow-up visit. Patients who underwent PFTs were optimally treated for their underlying lung disease 
before these assessments were performed and spirometry occurred before ALIS dosing. 
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the protocol-defined primary endpoint (SCC by month 6). Assuming a SCC 
rate by month 6 of ≥ 20% for the ALIS + MDR arm and a rate of 5% for the MDR alone arm and applying 
a 2:1 randomisation ratio, a sample size of 261 (174 ALIS + MDR and 87 MDR alone) was considered to 
provide at least 90% power for the continuity-corrected Chi-square test at the 2-sided significance level 
of 0.05. To ensure at least 261 evaluable patients (culture results every month from day 1 to month 6) it 
was anticipated that up to approximately 351 patients should be randomised. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were stratified at screening according to smoking status (current smoker or not) and 
prior MDR use (on treatment or off-treatment for at least 3 months) and then randomly assigned in a 2:1 
ratio to ALIS + MDR or to MDR alone using an interactive web response system. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population (all randomised) was the primary analysis population. The 
proportion with sustained SCC through 3-months off-treatment was analysed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test (stratified by smoking status and prior MDR). The adjusted odds 
ratio (OR), the 95% CI for the OR and P-value are presented. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The study enrolled 336 subjects at 127 sites in 18 countries. One ALIS patient was not treated.

Figure 9: Disposition of subjects (end of treatment) – ITT population 
While 246 (73.2%) were completers, the discontinuation rate was much higher in the ALIS group due to 
AEs or patient decision.  
Protocol deviations were reported in 287 patients (85.4%) overall, including 195 (87.1%) in the ALIS + 
MDR arm and 92 (82.1%) in the MDR alone arm. Major protocol deviations (in 32.6% and 29.5%) 
concerned incorrect version of approved ICF signed (16.4%). In the ALIS + MDR arm, 122/224 (54.5%) 
reported deviations related to non-compliance with visit schedule, which included visits and/or 
assessments performed outside of schedule. In the MDR alone arm, 63/112 (56.3%) reported deviations 
related to non-compliance with visit schedule. 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 64.7 years with 69.3% being female (73.7% ALIS vs. 60.7% control). The highest 
number was enrolled in North America (47.3%) followed by Europe (22.6%) and most were White 
(69.9%). With the exception of gender, baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the two 
treatment arms. The majority was on a regimen including a macrolide (91.4%), a rifamycin (84.5%) or 
ethambutol (79.8%) and 68.5% were on triple therapy. Of 6 patients not on a MDR regimen at baseline, 
4 restarted after Day 7, 1 withdrew consent and 1 was not dosed.

Table 10: Baseline characteristics – ITT population 
The mean duration of MDR treatment prior to enrolment in the study was 3.94 years (SD = 3.863; median 
= 2.60; min, max = 0.2, 22), with means of 4.31 years in the ALIS + MDR arm compared to 3.20 years 
in the MDR alone arm.  
During the study, concomitant medication use was reported by 99.4% of patients. These included 
azithromycin (56.3%), clarithromycin (39.0%), rifampicin (74.1%), rifabutin (14.0%) and ethambutol 
(72.0%). Other common medications used for the treatment of NTM lung disease included 
fluoroquinolones (29.8%), clofazimine (14.6%) and linezolid (1.8%). Selective beta-2-adrenoreceptor 
agonists were used by 47.3% (51.3% ALIS vs. 39.3% controls).  
There were 336 patients in the ITT population (224 ALIS) and 243 in the PP population (145 ALIS). 
Treatment adherence within 80% to 120% from baseline to EOT was seen in 70.9% in the ALIS + MDR 
arm and 28.7% had adherence < 80%. 
Primary analysis – sustained SCC at 3 months off-treatment 
All non-converters (who could not therefore achieve sustained SCC) were counted in the denominators.  
A patient was counted as positive at each visit after they died or if there was a missed visit or missed 
sputum sample.  
Based on these criteria, 36/224 (16.1%) in the ALIS + MDR arm vs. 0/112 in the MDR alone arm achieved 
sustained SCC at month 3 post-treatment. Rates for sustained SCC at month 3 (all in the ALIS + MDR 
group) were 19/104 (18%) in N. America, 3/48 (6%) in Europe, 4/34 (12%) in Japan and 10/24 (42%) 
in Oceania. As shown below, 29/65 and 10/10 in respective groups with SCC at month 6 (hence 75 
continued in the study beyond month 8) did not sustain SCC at 3 months off treatment.

Table 11: Analysis of durable conversion at 3-month follow-up based on subjects who 
achieved sustained culture conversion at 12 months of treatment since conversion 
– ITT population 
All of the 36 ALIS + MDR patients with sustained SCC at month 3 off treatment had initially achieved SCC 
at or before month 3 of treatment (based on Figure 14 in CSR and the table below).  
Based only on the 75 patients (65 ALIS + MDR and 10 MDR) who had achieved SCC by month 6, 36/65 
(55.4%) vs. 0/10 had sustained SCC at the 3-month follow-up visit (P = 0.0017). 
Based only on the 44 patients with sustained SCC at 12 months of treatment from start of SCC (41 ALIS 
+ MDR and 3 MDR), 36/44 (81.8%) had sustained SCC at 3 months off-treatment. For the 8 patients (5 
ALIS + MDR and 3 MDR alone) who did not sustain SCC off treatment: 
-  3 ALIS + MDR and 2 MDR had missing visits or results (missing considered positive)  
-  2 ALIS + MDR had at least 1 agar positive culture or at least 3 consecutive broth positive cultures 
after 12 months of treatment or at the 28-Day or 3-Month follow-up visit(s). 
-  1 in the MDR alone arm withdrew from the study. 
Sensitivity analyses of the EU primary endpoint were performed as follows: 
o  When missing data for converters with missing broth or agar sputum culture result after Month 6 up 
to and including 3 months off-treatment were imputed as negative if the visit with missing cultures 
was between two visits with negative cultures or if the patient was unable to produce sputum even 
after induction, 40/224 (17.9%) ALIS + MDR patients achieved sustained SCC at the 3-month 
follow-up visit vs. 0/112 for MDR alone (P < 0.0001). The same result applied when patients who 
converted with no more than 1 missing broth or agar culture result after month 6 were considered as 
converters with durability.  
o  When sustained SCC was defined as achieving SCC by month 6 and then having no broth or agar 
positive culture up to 3 months off-treatment and no visits missing broth or agar culture results 
30/224 (13.4%) vs. 0/112 achieved sustained SCC at the 3-month follow-up visit (P < 0.0001). 
Sustained SCC at 3 months off-treatment in those who achieved SCC by month 6 and continued to have 
negative agar cultures and no more than 2 consecutive positive broth cultures through EOT occurred in 
41/224 (18.3%) in the ALIS + MDR arm vs. 0 in the MDR alone arm (P < 0.0001). All 41 had initially 
achieved SCC no later than month 4 on treatment.

Ancillary analyses 
Sustained SCC at the 12-month follow-up visit 
The final CSR provided during the procedure included an analysis of the secondary endpoint of durable 
conversion at 12-month follow-up. Similar to the approach taken for the analysis of the primary endpoint 
of durable culture conversion at 3-month follow-up, a visit was considered culture-positive due to death, 
no visit, or missing sputum samples (unless unable to produce despite induction).  
At the 12-month follow-up visit, 30 subjects (13.4%) in the ALIS + MDR arm, and 0 subjects in the MDR 
alone arm (p < 0.0001) achieved durable conversion according to the rules applied by the applicant. The 
details of follow-up visits and whether there was a positive solid culture or broth culture result or no visit/no 
sample are provided in Figure 10 below. Note that Figure 10 shows the serial culture results for the 44 
patients (41 ALIS and 3 MDR alone) who achieved SCC during the first 6 months on treatment and, based on 
the applicant’s rules, were deemed to have sustained SCC at the month 12 on-treatment visit.     
Rates of conversion, sustained conversion, and durable (at 3 and 12 months after stopping treatment for 
NTM) conversion showed a relatively consistent effect of the addition of ALIS and showed consistently 
that no subject in the control group had maintained conversion off treatment across species.   
Rates of conversion, sustained conversion, and durable conversion are shown by region in the table below 
Figure 10. In Europe, more patients treated with ALIS + MDR achieved conversion, sustained conversion, 
and durable conversion compared to MDR alone, which is very consistent with observations made in North 
America, in Oceania, and in Japan.  
Relapse or recurrence was defined as having MAC-positive sputum cultures in broth media (agar 
negative) for 3 or more consecutive months or having at least 1 MAC-positive sputum culture on agar 
media (agar positive) after SCC. Relapse was defined as a positive culture after SCC that was the same 
species and genotype (copy number and allele number) as that isolated at Screening/Baseline. 
Recurrence was defined as a positive culture after SCC that was either a different species than that 
isolated at Screening/Baseline or the same species but different genotype (different copy number and/or 
allele number) than that isolated at Screening/Baseline.  
In the ALIS arm, 13/65 (20.0%) who had SCC experienced relapse/recurrence, including 8 discovered 
during a planned on-treatment visit and 5 during the off-treatment follow-up visits. Of these 13, 7 had a 
MAC relapse, of which 5 occurred on or before Month 8, and 6 had a MAC recurrence, of which 3 occurred 
on treatment (after Month 8).  
Of the 10 converters in the MDR alone arm, 4 (40.0%) experienced relapse (3) or recurrence (1), all of 
which occurred during the on-treatment study period.

6MWT change from baseline to month 6 
There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the change in 6MWT from 
baseline to month 6. For the entire ITT population, there was a numeric difference in favour of converters 
compared to non-converters (LS mean difference [SE]: 22.69 [9.404] meters; 95% CI: 4.17, 41.21; P = 
0.0165). 
Microbiological analyses 
In the ITT population 335/336 patients (223 ALIS) had MAC isolated from sputum at baseline and/or 
screening. In the ALIS + MDR group, M. avium was isolated from 101/224 (45.1%), M. intracellulare from 
88/224 (39.3%) and unspeciated MAC from 34/224 (15.2%). Similar proportions of MAC species were 
isolated from the patients in the MDR alone group. Most North American isolates from ALIS + MDR 
patients were M. intracellulare (55/104). Among European isolates the majority was M. avium. Nearly all 
Japanese isolates were M. avium (31/34) and 18/24 from Oceania were M. intracellulare. 
For the 335 MAC isolates overall, an MIC50 of 32 μg/mL and MIC90 of 64 μg/mL were observed. European 
isolates were generally most susceptible (MIC50 of 8 μg/mL and MIC90 of 16 μg/mL). Amikacin MIC 
distributions were very similar for MAC isolated from the two treatment groups.  
Figure 12: Amikacin MIC distribution – MAC at baseline/screening (Study INS-212) 
Overall, 73/335 (21.8%) of baseline MAC isolates were resistant (based on criteria applicable to plasma 
levels) to clarithromycin (22.9% for ALIS + MDR and 19.6% for the MDR alone group). The highest 
degree of clarithromycin resistance was observed among M. avium (46/152 [30.3%]). 
By geographic region, higher clarithromycin resistance rates occurred in Japan and rest of Asia. 
The SCC rates by month 6 for ALIS + MDR patients with M. avium and M. intracellulare at baseline were 
similar (30/101 [29.7%] and 29/88 [33.0%], respectively). Corresponding rates for MDR alone patients 
were 3/51 (5.9%) and 5/45 (11.1%). For unspeciated MAC, month 6 SCC rates were 6/34 [17.6%] for 
ALIS + MDR vs. 2/16 [12.5%] for MDR alone. Rates by region are shown below.

Table 13: Culture conversion rates (Study INS-212, ITT) 
Based on susceptibility testing criteria applicable to plasma levels, the SCC rates by month 6 rates for 
patients with clarithromycin-susceptible MAC at baseline (MIC ≤ 8 μg/mL) were 55/165 (33.3%) in the 
ALIS + MDR group vs. 9/87 (10.3%) in the MDR alone group. Among the few with MAC showing 
intermediate resistance (MIC = 16 μg/mL) the rates were 3/7 and 0/3 while rates for those with 
clarithromycin-resistant MAC (MIC ≥ 32 μg/mL) were 7/51 (13.7%) and 1/22 (4.5%). 
The figure below shows that there was no correlation between amikacin MIC value at baseline and SCC by 
month 6 in the ALIS group. The SCC rates varied from 28.6% to 34.5% for MAC with baseline amikacin 
MICs from 8 to 64 μg/mL. Lack of correlation was also confirmed when the data were examined by species 
and by region.

Figure 13: Correlation of amikacin MIC to Culture conversion of MAC for ALIS + MDR-Treated 
subjects (Study INS-212) 
MAC isolates with an amikacin MIC of > 64 μg/mL were seen at one or more visits in 29 patients, of which 
25 were randomised to ALIS + MDR and 4 to MDR alone. Of the 25 in the ALIS + MDR arm: 
• 
• 
• 
3 had an isolate with an amikacin MIC > 64 μg/mL at screening that at baseline and subsequent visits 
was ≤ 64 μg/mL. One achieved conversion but the conversion was not durable 
1 had an isolate with an amikacin MIC > 64 μg/mL at baseline and did not achieve culture conversion 
21 had isolates with an amikacin MIC > 64 μg/mL post-baseline 
In 13/21 the isolate was macrolide-susceptible 
o 1 achieved culture conversion at Month 2 
o 1 achieved culture conversion at Month 1 with amikacin MIC > 64 μg/mL for either a new or the 
same isolate cultured at Month 5 that subsequently reverted to amikacin MIC < 64 μg/mL at 
Months 6 and at EOT 
o 3 had isolates that subsequently reverted to an amikacin MIC < 64 μg/mL at some point during 
treatment but did not achieve culture conversion 
o 8 had isolates with either persistent MICs > 64 μg/mL or MIC > 64 μg/mL for the last cultured 
isolate and none achieved culture conversion 
The other 8 had macrolide-resistant isolates with either persistent amikacin MICs > 64 μg/mL or MIC 
> 64 μg/mL for the last cultured isolate and none achieved culture conversion. 
None of the 4 in the MDR alone arm achieved sputum culture conversion 
o 3 had macrolide-susceptible isolates at baseline 
o 1 had a macrolide-resistant isolate at baseline 
Of the 7 patients exposed to ALIS in the ALIS+MDR arm who did not achieve sustained culture conversion 
due to a microbiological reason for relapse/recurrence; 5 patients had changes in amikacin MIC that were 
acceptable within CLSI guidance (2 with a 2-fold increase, 2 with no change, and 1 with 2-fold decrease). 
Only 2 patients had an increase in amikacin MIC (4-fold increase).   
In summary, treatment failure occurred in 24/25 ALIS patients who had isolates with an amikacin MIC > 
64 μg/mL at baseline and/or post-baseline. Also, all patients with amikacin MIC > 64 μg/mL and baseline 
macrolide resistance failed treatment with ALIS.

Stepwise logistic regression (SLR) 
Seven factors (age, baseline amikacin MIC, baseline clarithromycin MIC, geographic region, sex, SGRQ 
total score and randomisation stratum) were included in the initial list of predictors for the SLR.  
The final model from the SLR analysis indicated that treatment (forced inclusion), region, SGRQ quartile 
and clarithromycin MIC were predictors of achieving SCC by month 6. Compared to North America, Asian 
patients were less likely to convert, Japanese and European patients had a similar chance of converting 
and patients from Oceania had an increased chance of conversion. Patients in the SGRQ first and second 
quartiles (better lung function) had higher chances of conversion than those in the fourth quartile. 
Patients with isolates that had baseline clarithromycin MICs ≤ 64 μg/mL had a better chance of 
conversion vs. those with MICs > 64 μg/mL. 
For sustainable culture conversion through EOT, the selected effects were treatment, region and SGRQ 
quartile. Patients in Oceania had a better chance of achieving sustained SCC vs. North Americans but all 
other regions were no different to North America. Patients in the SGRQ first and second quartiles had 
better chances of sustaining SCC vs. those in the fourth quartile. 
The effect of factors on sustained SCC at 3 months off treatment could not be assessed due to the lack of 
any patients in the MDR alone arm achieving this endpoint. 
Table 14: Final model from stepwise logistic-regression analysis of sputum culture 
conversion status (Study INS-212 [ITT population]) 
During the procedure it was clarified that about 30% of patients enrolled into INS-212 had been exposed 
to prior aminoglycoside treatment (systemic and/or inhaled) aimed at MAC. About 12-14% of all patients 
had received an inhaled aminoglycoside off-label (even if they received an approved inhaled formulation 
it would not have been indicated for treating MAC NTM).  
Those patients who had not already tried aminoglycoside treatment were more likely to respond to 
Arikayce but this was not accounted for by baseline amikacin MIC.

Post-hoc analysis of persistence of SCC in patients with SCC by month 6 
In this post hoc analysis patients were assumed to have lost persistence of culture negativity at the first 
instance of any of the following situations: 
• First agar positive culture or first of 3 consecutive monthly broth positive cultures 
• First instance of a missing visit or culture result 
• First use of rescue medication 
• Discontinuation of the study or of treatment 
Loss of response included new as well as recurring infections. 
At Month 2 since conversion all of the 75 patients in either arm with SCC by month 6 had persistent 
culture negativity. Subsequently, all 10 patients in the MDR alone arm lost SCC status, of which 4 had a 
positive culture, 4 had missing visit/result and 2 discontinued the study prior to receiving 12 months of 
treatment since conversion. 
In the ALIS + MDR and MDR alone arms 29/65 patients lost culture negativity for the reasons shown in 
the table below. As shown, 9 had positive cultures and another 6 were known to have withdrawn due to 
AEs. This accounts for ~half of the 29 cases.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant provided a table of SCC rates on treatment in Phase 2 and 3 as shown below. These data 
cannot be directly compared due to differences in study populations and designs.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no studies confined to special populations. The numbers of patients aged > 65 years in 
INS-212 and their outcomes was provided during the procedure. Patients < 65 years of age were the 
largest age subgroup. The overall trend of outcomes between the ALIS + MDR arm and MDR alone was 
similar regardless of age subgroups.

Supportive studies 
This extension study was conducted at 77 sites in 16 countries. The primary objective was to assess the 
safety of ALIS 590 mg QD in conjunction with systemic SOC in patients who had been enrolled in INS-212 
and had completed the month 6 and 8 visits but failed to achieve confirmed SCC (i.e. did not have 3 
consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures or had experienced a relapse or recurrence (defined as in 
INS-212) after culture conversion had occurred.  
Assessment report

All patients who elected to enrol into INS-312 were to continue the multidrug anti-mycobacterial regimen 
that they were receiving during study INS-212 and were to also receive ALIS 590 mg QD for up to 12 
months. There was a final visit at 13 months (1 month off ALIS treatment) for safety follow-up. No 
statistical hypotheses were pre-specified and all endpoints were reported descriptively. 
Results as reported in the final CSR dated 3 May 2019 
There were 163 patients who opted to enrol in INS-312 (73 prior ALIS+MDR and 90 MDR alone in 
INS-212). Since 75 continued in INS-212 (=238), that leaves 98 patients (336-238) unaccounted for 
after the month 8 visit in INS-212. Overall, 104/163 (63.8%) completed treatment and 107/163 (65.6%) 
completed the study while 31 (19.0%) achieved SCC by Month 6 and 40 (24.5%) by Month 12. 
Table 182: Analysis of culture conversion by month 6 and month 12 – safety population 
In both subgroups defined by prior exposure to ALIS most of those that did achieve SCC did so by month 
6 and most by month 4.

Although INS-312 involved 12 months of treatment and a last visit at month 13 it seems from the table 
below that very few patients who achieved SCC at some point maintained SCC despite continuing 
treatment. At EOS, based on the ITT population, 24/163 (14.7%) had achieved and still sustained SCC 
but there were no further visits so sustainability beyond month 13 is not known.

For the 163 MAC isolates overall, the amikacin MIC50 was 32 μg/mL and the MIC90 was 64 μg/mL. There 
was a suggestion that prior exposure to ALIS influenced the MIC distribution. 
Among patients previously treated with MDR alone, 13/42 (31.0%) with M. avium, 13/38 (34.2%) with M. 
intracellulare and 4/10 (40.0%) with unspeciated MAC achieved conversion when treated with ALIS + 
MDR. Patients with clarithromycin-susceptible isolates converted at a rate of 37.1% (26/70) vs. 33.3% 
(1/3) for intermediate susceptibility and 17.6% (3/17) for resistant isolates. Overall there was no 
detectable correlation between amikacin MIC value at baseline and SCC by month 6. Regardless of prior 
exposure to ALIS, patients with strains having amikacin MICs > 64 μg/mL did not convert. Similar results 
were observed for M. avium and M. intracellulare.

TR02-112 
This Phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the use of ALIS in patients in 
N. America with recalcitrant NTM lung disease. It commenced in 2012 and completed July 2015. The CSR 
is dated 4 August 2017. The general design is shown below. 
• 
The double-blind phase compared ALIS 590 mg QD vs. placebo for 84 days in patients with 
treatment-refractory NTM lung infection on a stable multi-drug regimen.  
•  All patients who consented to continue in the open-label phase received ALIS 590 mg QD for 84 
days and had a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks after the end of treatment visit. 
• 
Patients who completed either phase of the study were invited to attend further safety follow-up 
at 12 and 24 months (window ± 2 months) after the last dose.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline on the SQS for mycobacterial culture for the 
ALIS vs. placebo group at Day 84. The endpoint used the semi-quantitative mycobacterial culture 
reporting method, expressed on a 7-step scale.  
With a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, 50 patients per arm were believed to provide 80% power to 
detect a difference between the treatment arms of at least 0.94 steps on the semi-quantitative scale 
(SQS) in the change from baseline in mycobacterial culture, assuming a pooled standard deviation of 1.6 
(based on simulated information), based on a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Additionally, 50 patients per arm 
were considered to provide 80% power to detect a difference between treatments of at least 17% in the 
proportion with NTM culture conversion to negative, assuming rates of 3% for placebo and 20% for ALIS, 
based on a CMH test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.  
As shown below, the study failed in the pre-defined primary analysis.

Table 19: Change from baseline of the full SQS scale for mycobacterial culture at Day 84 
(mITT population) 
In patients with M. abscessus and/or with CF there was no difference in mycobacterial loads between ALIS 
and placebo at Day 84. In contrast, the change in load at day 84 for patients without CF or with MAC gave 
p-values of 0.036 and 0.045, respectively. A similar pattern of findings applied to proportions with a 
negative culture at day 84.  
Post hoc analysis of SCC and sustained SCC 
In the post hoc analyses SCC was defined as 3 consecutive negative cultures. This analysis (using the 
revised SQS assignment of samples and including those with negative cultures at baseline) showed that 
23 patients demonstrated SCC at some time point by the 28-day follow up visit. Of the 23, 20 patients 
achieved SCC while receiving ALIS in the double-blind phase or in the open-label phase of the study. Of 
these 23 patients, 19 had non-CF underlying disease and were infected with MAC. 
When focussing on the non-CF MAC population that is the subject of this MAA: 
o  54 patients with non-CF MAC lung disease were randomised and treated in TR02-112  
o 
In the double-blind phase 27 received ALIS and 27 received placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 77/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
o  The open-label phase enrolled 22/27 from the ALIS group and all 27 from the placebo group; thus 54 
non-CF MAC patients had the opportunity to receive between 84 and 168 days of ALIS. 
Of the 23 patients the CSR states had SCC at some time on treatment: 
o  19/23 were non-CF MAC patients, 12 from the initial ALIS group and 7 from the initial placebo group. 
o  5/12 from the initial ALIS group had negative cultures on day 1. One of these never had a positive 
culture at any visit. The other four each had a single visit with a positive culture (all were step 2 or 
3). Two were positive at day 28, one at day 168 and one at the day 28 follow-up. There were negative 
cultures at all other visits. With negative cultures at day 1 and single positives on therapy it is not 
possible to conclude that these patients really had SCC on study. 
o  7/12 from the initial ALIS group were positive on day 1 and at some time had 3 consecutive visits 
with negative cultures (i.e. met the post hoc definition of SCC). Of these 7: 
1 was positive at the day 28 follow-up and had no M12 follow-up visit 
1 was positive at M12 follow-up 
1 was negative up to the day 28 follow-up but had no M12 visit   
1 was negative from day 112 to the day 28 follow-up but had no sputum at the M12 visit 
3 were negative from first SCC time point to M12 follow-up 
o  3/7 from the initial placebo group had negative cultures on day 1. One never had a positive culture 
and one had a single positive result (step 2 on day 112). These two patients cannot be included in the 
analysis of SCC on ALIS (see also above). The third was positive from day 28-112 and is counted 
below in the SCC rates. 
o  5/7 from the initial placebo group (4 who were positive on day 1 and the patient described above who 
was negative on day 1 but positive from day 28-112) could be assessed for possible SCC: 
1 had SCC on placebo and remained negative at the day 28 follow-up but had no M12 visit 
4 had SCC at some time after switching to ALIS. Of these 4: 
1 was negative at M12 
1 was positive at M12 
2 have no result at M12 (one had no day 28 or M12 follow-up and one had no sputum) 
o  Of the 47/54 non-CF MAC patients treated with ALIS who had positive baseline cultures there were 
4 with a confirmed SCC plus a negative culture at the M12 follow-up visit, which gives a SCC rate of 
4/47 (= 8.5%).  
o 
If the two patients who attended M12 but had no sputum are assumed to be negative, then the SCC 
rate is 6/47 (= 12.8%).  
If the other two patients who were negative at the day 28 follow-up but did not attend the M12 visit are 
assumed to be negative, then the most optimistic SCC rate is 8/47 (= 17%). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose of Arikayce and duration of treatment 
There is no good rationale for the daily dose or for once daily dosing. Since PK-PD analyses cannot be 
applied to dose-finding in this situation, the only way to select a dose would be from dose-finding studies. 
Dose-finding studies of a size sufficient to draw clear conclusions would likely be difficult in this indication 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 78/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and, for feasibility and timing, would probably have to rely on an on-treatment SCC rate. Once daily 
dosing has been pursued throughout the ALIS programme. The sputum concentration data up to 72 h 
post-dose in NTM/MAC patients generally support a conclusion that amikacin is released slowly from 
liposomes deposited in airways. 
In INS-212, the duration of treatment after confirmed SCC was to be 12 months, which followed 
recommendations from the American Lung Association. In line with INS-212, the SmPC recommends that 
Arikayce is continued for 12 months after SCC. It is also recommended that treatment should not be 
continued of SCC has not occurred by month 6, with a maximum duration of 18 months.  
INS-212  
This is the single pivotal study. It was conducted in the target population of non-CF patients with chronic 
MAC lung disease and it prospectively followed-up patients eligible to stop all MAC treatment for a total of 
12 months off therapy. Following CHMP advice and development of a separate SAP for the EU, INS-212 
set out to evaluate post-treatment sustained SCC rates with a primary endpoint at 3 months off all 
treatment. The final CSR submitted during the procedure also provided complete data for the month 12 
post-treatment visit. 
There are some design issues that merit mention as follows: 
INS-212 was open-label. The possibility that the open-label design influenced the discontinuation rates 
and/or AE reporting rates cannot be dismissed. 
Patients were discontinued at month 8 if they had not had SCC confirmed by month 6. Whilst the primary 
analysis is based on the entire ITT population, the interpretation of this analysis rests on the assumption 
that the post-treatment sustained SCC rate in the patients initially assigned to MDR alone would have 
been zero if they had been continued on MDR alone in the study. Overall, in a population that had mostly 
received prior unsuccessful treatment for MAC for several years, and given the actual results for the 10 
control group patients retained in the study after month 8, it is reasonable to assume that the 
post-treatment sustained SCC rate on MDR alone would have been zero or, at least, negligible. 
According to protocol rules, a patient was considered to have sustained SCC up to end of 12 months 
post-SCC treatment provided there were no positive agar cultures and no more than 2 consecutive 
positive monthly broth cultures. Also, a patient was considered to have sustained SCC at the 3-month 
follow-up visit provided that there had been no positive agar cultures and no more than 3 consecutive 
positive monthly broth cultures at any time after conversion. Reflecting his definition, patients were 
determined to have experienced relapse/recurrence if they had positive sputum culture in broth media for 
3 or more consecutive months, or 1 positive sputum culture in agar media, after achieving SCC. 
Furthermore, if the patient was unable to produce sputum despite reasonable efforts, and had already 
met the definition of SCC, this was recorded as a negative culture result. 
These definitions are not considered appropriate. Any positive culture (agar or broth) post SCC should be 
counted as a positive for the visit at which the sample was obtained since this result is evidence of residual 
MAC in the airways. However, patients with intermittent positives who were negative at EOT and negative 
at each post-treatment follow-up visit could be counted as successes in the primary analysis. Due to these 
concerns, the applicant was requested to provide a tabulation of serial culture results for the ALIS and 
MDR alone patients who were deemed to have sustained SCC at least up to the time that they completed 
month of post-SCC treatment. 
Although patients were to have received at least 6 months of treatment for MAC, this could have consisted 
of only two agents and it could have been stopped < 12 months before screening. Overall, the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 79/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
population was not confined to patients who had failed to respond to what could be considered an 
adequate treatment regimen for MAC and could be regarded as a mixture of inadequately treated (some 
of whom may have been non-adherent) and recalcitrant patients. 
The study required that MAC isolates should have amikacin MIC ≤ 64 mg/L at baseline for the patient to 
be eligible for enrolment. This threshold MIC was based on the CLSI Guideline M62, which set the 
breakpoint for amikacin for testing MAC, noting that MAC with amikacin MICs > 64 mg/L may be 
resistant. However, this criterion is based on systemic administration of amikacin and cannot be regarded 
as relevant to inhalation. There was no attempt to “optimise” the background MDR at baseline. Other than 
amikacin, only susceptibility to clarithromycin of baseline MAC isolates was determined and this was 
conducted retrospectively. 
This single pivotal study was powered to meet the FDA-recommended primary endpoint of on-treatment 
SCC rate at month 6 with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.  
INS-312 
This was an uncontrolled study in which patients enrolled into INS-212 who had failed to achieve SCC by 
month 6 or had relapsed within that period could elect to receive open-label ALIS for up to 12 months. The 
aim was to analyse safety and there was follow-up for only one month off-treatment. 
TR02-112 
The study employed a double-blind design vs. placebo (empty liposomes) over the first 84 days (12 
weeks), after which patients (including CF patients and NTM not confined to MAC) could elect to receive 
open-label ALIS for up to 84 days. The study was not planned ab initio to support MAA. It was primarily 
designed to detect a difference between the treatment arms of at least 0.94 steps on the 
semi-quantitative scale. The assessment of SCC based on consecutive negatives was conducted in a post 
hoc fashion. Patients often continued background MAC treatment after stopping ALIS and the follow-up 
visits were planned for safety so that there was incomplete sputum sampling. This was regarded as a 
hypothesis-generating study that was not designed to detect and quantify the clinical benefit of ALIS. It 
provided useful safety data vs. empty liposomes (placebo) and the results pointed to confining Phase 3 to 
non-CF patients with MAC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
INS-212 
The study met the pre-defined enrolment target to address the FDA-recommended primary endpoint. The 
age and gender distribution were in line with published data on disease epidemiology. The duration of 
prior treatment ranged from 0.2-22 years and only one patient had been treated for <6 months. 
Treatment effect 
In the prior MAA, the applicant reported a post-treatment sustained SCC rate of 36/224 (16%) at month 
3 for ALIS vs. 0/112 for MDR alone. During the procedure, the final CSR for INS-212 was submitted, 
including data to month 12 post-treatment. The applicant reported a continued SCC in 30/224 (13.4%) 
vs. 0/112 at this final visit. This is based on the applicant’s counting schema as described previously, 
which is not entirely agreed. 
Serial culture data were provided for 44 patients – 41 initially assigned to ALIS and 3 initially assigned to 
MDR alone – who had SCC (as defined in the protocol) by month 6 on treatment so continued in the study 
on their assigned treatment after month 8 and were solid culture negative at month 12. Of these 44, two 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 80/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
were broth culture positive at month 12 and 6 did not have a result. Also, at end of treatment, one ALIS 
patient was solid culture positive and one MDR alone patient had no result.   
Importantly, not all of these 44 patients had MAC cultured from their baseline (as opposed to screening 
visit) sputum specimen. There were 9 ALIS and 2 MDR patients with completely negative cultures on Day 
1. Of these subjects, 6/9 ALIS and one of the 2 MDR patients had no post-baseline positive solid or broth 
cultures. It cannot be ruled out that on-study treatment with ALIS+MDR or MDR alone made no difference 
to these 7 patients, leaving 35 and 1 that can be assessed. 
Focussing on the 35 ALIS patients for whom an on-treatment SCC was demonstrated, and counting any 
solid or broth culture positive after SCC occurred as failure, there were 30/224 (13.4%) with SCC through 
to month 3 post-treatment and 25/224 (11%) with SCC through to Month 12 post-treatment.   
It was agreed with the applicant that there were no MDR alone patients who achieved SCC on study and 
had a documented post-treatment response. 
In summary, whilst the applicant reports a post-treatment sustained SCC rate of 36/224 (16%) at month 
3 and 30/224 (13.4%) at month 12, the assessment indicated rates of 30/224 (13.4%) and 25/224 
(11%) at respective visits.  
Success rates were comparable for M. avium and M. intracellulare and, perhaps, may be lower for the 
unspeciated NTMs that were considered to fall within the MAC complex. Also, success rates were 
comparable for the US and Japan, where the majority was enrolled. In Europe, <10% of 48 patients had 
a sustained conversion compared to ~40% of the 24 enrolled in Oceania. However, these differences may 
have arisen by chance. 
TR02-112 and INS-312 
TR02-112 did not provide clear evidence of clinical benefit for adding ALIS for 84 or 168 days and was 
considered to be of low relevance to the overall conclusion on efficacy. However, the lack of a 
microbiological response in patients with M. abscessus and patients with CF were important findings and 
led to exclusion of such patients from INS-212. 
INS-312 was uncontrolled. The on-treatment SCC rates by month 6 in the patients carried over from 
INS-212 who had been initially randomised to the MDR alone group gave similar rates to those in the 
patients randomised to ALIS in INS-212. 
Additional expert consultation 
A SAG was held on 10 July. 
The questions to the SAG and their answers are as follows: 
1. Approximately 1/8 patients who ever start on Arikayce might have a sustained SCC on 
treatment that is maintained after stopping all NTM treatment. In light of the target patient 
population for Arikayce [Arikayce is indicated for the treatment of non-tuberculous 
mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in 
adults with very limited treatment options] the SAG is requested to comment on whether the 
magnitude of efficacy observed is of clinical relevance. 
The experts agreed that the magnitude of effect is limited. However, this might still be counted as 
clinically relevant in a selected population (e.g. with intractable disease, for whom very limited treatment 
options remain. Ideally, ‘very limited treatment options’ would be clarified). 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 81/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Adequately selected patients may particularly benefit, e.g. those for whom conventional therapy cannot 
be used and inhalational amikacin could offer an alternative. 
It is however difficult to identify the best target population, as inclusion of a heterogeneous population 
with lack of stratification is one of the shortcomings of the study design. Another shortcoming is absence 
of clinical endpoints (e.g. survival, quality of life measures).  
However, for the small number of patients affected, it is recognised that it would be difficult to have 
additional studies performed to collect these additional data. The company said 275 European patients 
were treated in a compassionate use programme. The outcomes should be known. Is a registry 
something that could be explored to complement the submitted clinical data? 
Sustained sputum culture conversion is one outcome goal to be achieved, amongst others. 
2. Does the SAG consider that there could be a clinical benefit of Arikayce in patients who 
achieve on-treatment SCC that is not sustained post-therapy? 
No evidence-based data exist. However, the consensus amongst the experts was that indeed for patients 
achieving on-treatment SCC without sustained post-therapy, a clinical benefit exists for those with very 
limited treatment options remaining. The reduction in bacterial load could provide a short-term 
amelioration of symptoms, which is considered clinically meaningful. This would need to be weighed 
against the potential increase of drug-resistance caused by inappropriate use.  
3. Does the SAG consider the documented safety profile of Arikayce, including the 
considerable discontinuation rates due to AEs that include airways intolerance and side 
effects typical of aminoglycosides, to be manageable in the target patient population? 
The experts agreed that the listed adverse events would be mostly manageable. Patients should however 
be treated in experienced, specialised centres and be well informed on the risks. For the longer-term side 
effects, ototoxicity might be most problematic and irreversible. Tinnitus could seriously hamper quality of 
life. To limit that risk, the approximate cumulative doses with increased probability for ototoxicity should 
be determined. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, it was concluded that Arikayce could result in a sustained post-treatment SCC, which is of 
undeniable clinical benefit, in approximately 1/8 patients. The fact that the month 6 on-treatment SCC 
rate was significantly higher in the ALIS group (65/224 vs. 10/112) was also taken into consideration but 
it was not possible to discern the clinical benefit that might be associated with such an event from the 
data provided.  
Taking into account the difficulty in managing such patients, it was finally concluded that this modest 
benefit might suffice to support a very restricted approval for use that also reflected the concerns over 
the safety profile. Thus, the final indication statement is confined to: Arikayce is indicated for the 
treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by Mycobacterium avium 
Complex (MAC) in adults with limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis. See sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.1.

conclusions on efficacy in subgroups such that a more specific wording directing patient selection was

The need to use Arikayce as part of a combination regimen, along with information on stopping treatment 
and maximum duration of treatment, has been reflected in section 4.2. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
o 
o 
o 
In the prior application the focus of the safety assessment was on the comparison between ALIS and 
placebo (empty liposomes) in the NTM patients enrolled into TR02-112, which clearly showed that 
amikacin per se is a bronchial irritant.  
In the current application the safety data from NTM/MAC patients who received ALIS in any of 
TR02-112, INS-212 and INS-312 were pooled and compared with those who received placebo 
(empty liposomes) in TR02-112 or MDR alone in INS-212.  
A second pooled analysis population included data from all studies in which patients with any of 
NTM/MAC, CF or bronchiectasis received multiple doses of ALIS. 
Patient exposure 
In the ALIS group of the NTM population, all 404 subjects (100%) received ALIS dosing at 590 mg. Note 
that the applicant denotes all controls as “placebo” in the tables that follow but there was no placebo used 
in INS-212 (controls had MDR alone).

Adverse events 
Table 21: Summary of treatment emergent adverse event (NTM studies) 
In the NTM population, AEs and AEs considered related to study treatment were reported more often in 
patients who received ALIS. AEs leading to discontinuation or interruption were also more likely to occur 
in ALIS-treated patients and greater proportions in the ALIS group had SAEs and/or experienced AEs of 
highest maximum CTCAE Grade ≥ 3. AEs in NTM patients with a difference in incidence of ≥ 10 
percentage points between treatment groups within any individual study are shown below.

AEs in the total safety population with a difference between treatment groups within either population of 
≥ 5 percentage points are shown below. 
Table 43: Treatment-emergent adverse event by MedDRA PT (≥ 5% of subjects in any group) 
Among AEs shown above, those that were clearly more common in ALIS patients included cough, 
dysphonia, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and oropharyngeal pain. In the NTM population, additional AEs that 
were more common in the ALIS patients included tinnitus, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue and infective 
exacerbation of bronchiectasis. 
In INS-212, most AEs were Grade 1 and Grade 2. Much of the difference between treatments was due to 
AEs affecting the respiratory tract. 
In TR02-112 72.7% ALIS vs. 37.8% placebo patients reported treatment-related AEs. The difference 
mainly reflected dysphonia, cough, oropharyngeal pain and infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis.

In INS-212 the investigator assessment of relatedness was confined to ALIS. The vast majority of ALIS 
patients had TEAEs deemed to be related to ALIS (185/224; 83.0%). The most common TEAEs 
considered related to ALIS were in the Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders SOC (163; 
[73.1%]), including dysphonia (99 [44.4%]), cough (74 [33.2%]), dyspnoea (38 [17.0%]), haemoptysis 
(25 [11.2%]) and oropharyngeal pain (19 [8.5%]). 
In NTM studies 404 patients treated with ALIS were observed (on study) for a cumulative 326.7 
patient-years. This compares with 157 controls observed for a cumulative 86.5 patient-years. When 
analysed by numbers experiencing TEAEs per 100 patient-years of exposure, the rates of 
discontinuations, interruptions, pulmonary exacerbations and severe AEs were still higher with ALIS. 
In the NTM population, some notable differences between the treatment groups (higher rate with ALIS) 
were observed as summarised below.  
Table 25: Adverse events by MedDRA SMQ in pooled populations 
An exposure-adjusted analysis of these events indicated that there was still an excess of vestibular 
disorders (including vertigo, dizziness and balance disorder). 
AESIs 
Within the NTM population, the proportions with AESIs were higher in the ALIS group for all categories.  
Table 56: Adverse events of special interest 
When AESI rates in NTM patients were adjusted for duration of exposure, rates were still higher with ALIS 
except for haemoptysis. The risk of allergic alveolitis in NTM patients is summarised in more detail in the 
table below.

Table 27: Characterisation of risk of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest 
category – Alveolitis allergic – multiple dose studies – safety population - frequency 
Most cases (9/13 in the ALIS group) were known to have resolved after stopping treatment and 
administration of steroids. Most were Grade 2 or 3 in severity and none was fatal in ALIS patients. 
In the NTM population with AEs in the SOC of ear and labyrinth disorders, the higher AE incidence in the 
ALIS group (16.6% vs. 9.6%) was driven mainly by tinnitus (see first table below).  
During the procedure, it was clarified that the majority of patients who had any AESI had only one such 
event. Nine (2.2%) ALIS patients had more than one AESI and one patient had 3 but the timing of these 
events generally did not suggest onset at similar times during treatment (see second table below).

Deaths  
The overall incidence of AEs with an outcome of death was not higher in the ALIS group.  
In the NTM population, the exposure-adjusted death rate was lower in the ALIS group (3.96 deaths per 
100 patient-years) than in the placebo group (9.25 deaths per 100 patient-years). Corresponding rates in 
the overall safety population were 1.81 vs. 8.44 deaths per 100 patient-years. None of the TEAEs with an 
outcome of death were considered related to the study medication.

SAEs  
In the NTM population, SAEs were more commonly reported in the ALIS group (109; 27.0%) than in the 
placebo group (27; 17.2%). This pattern was also observed in the safety population. 
In the NTM population, in the SOC of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, SAEs were reported 
for 47 (11.6%) ALIS vs. 14 (8.9%) control group patients. In the NTM population, in the SOC of infections 
and infestations, SAEs were reported for 51 (12.6%) ALIS vs. 9 (5.7%) controls.

Laboratory findings 
Individual clinically significant changes 
The incidence of potentially clinically meaningful hepatobiliary laboratory values after baseline was low 
(<3.5% in any group of either population). In the safety population, there were higher rates for the ALIS 
group, which the applicant ascribes to the effect of data from CF patients. 
Table 32: Potentially clinically meaningful hepatobiliary laboratory values (any after 
baseline) 
The table below shows potentially clinically meaningful renal laboratory values after baseline. Increases in 
serum creatinine from baseline to worst on treatment by either > 0.3 mg/dL or 50% were more 
commonly observed in the ALIS group but there were no noteworthy differences in proportions with a 
worst on-treatment eGFR of < 60 mL/min in either pooled population. 
Table 33: Potentially clinically meaningful renal function values (any after baseline) 
The overall incidence of shifts in hepatobiliary or chemistry parameters was low and there were no 
noteworthy differences between treatment groups. The incidence of shifts from normal at baseline to 
levels potentially of concern at 6 months for renal variables did not suggest an effect of ALIS on renal 
function. For haematology variables low leukocyte counts occurred more often in NTM patients treated 
with ALIS (17; 4.2%) vs. controls (4; 2.5%). Similarly, low neutrophil counts were reported for 9 (2.2%) 
vs. 1 (0.6%). 
Safety in special populations 
In the NTM population, SAEs overall were more commonly reported in men (36.8% in the ALIS group) 
than in women (23.5% in the ALIS group).  
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 90/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
However, as shown in the ISS table above, the overall difference was driven by the two comparative 
studies since the SAE rate was lower in males during INS-312. Also, the SAE rate was higher in males in 
the MDR alone group in INS-212 (in which males accounted for 26% of ALIS and 39% of the control 
group) but this was not seen in the placebo group in TR02-112 (where only 11-13% of the total enrolled 
was male). Review of the distribution of SAEs by SOC/PT did not reveal any single explanation for the 
overall differences.  
Deaths were also more commonly reported in men than women in NTM studies (5.7% vs. 2.3% in the 
ALIS-treated patients) but the difference was greater in the placebo group (12.2% vs. 1.9%). The overall 
differences were driven by INS-212 but review of the fatal AEs by gender did not identify any individual 
differences by SOC/PT that resulted in the overall difference.  
Immunological events 
See above re total rates of “hypersensitivity” AEs, at least some of which may have been instances of 
bronchospasm. However, the rates for rashes were higher with ALIS in both safety populations.  
Table 34: Treatment-emergent adverse events in MedDRA SOC of skin and subcutaneous 
disorders (≥ 1.5 percentage points difference between groups within either population) 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the NTM population, AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 96 (23.8%) in the ALIS group vs. 
none in the placebo group. Almost half of AEs leading to discontinuation were within the SOC of 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. The most commonly reported MedDRA PT was dyspnoea, 
in 12 (3.0%) patients. In INS-212 it seems that only one ALIS patient discontinued due to drug 
hypersensitivity.  
In the NTM population, AEs leading to interruption were reported in 191 (47.3%) ALIS patients vs. 4 
(2.5%) in the placebo group (in TR02-112).

Table 35: Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation by MedDRA PT (≥ 
1.5% in any group) 
The majority of AEs leading to interruption of ALIS were within the SOC of respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (127 [31.4%]) followed by AEs in the SOC of infections and infestations (49 
[12.1%]). The most commonly reported MedDRA PT was dysphonia in 59 (14.6%). 
Within INS-212106/223 (47.5%) of ALIS patients had a drug interruption. In 72 cases this was due to AEs 
within the respiratory system, most often dysphonia, dyspnoea and cough. Six had an interruption due to 
tinnitus and 2 due to rash.

Post marketing experience 
ALIS was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on 28 September 2018 for the treatment of MAC in 
adults as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative 
sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy.

There is an Arikares patient support programme in operation in the US and most reports seem to have 
come via this system. 
Post-marketing safety data from 28 September 2018 to 31 December 2019 were provided during the 
procedure. There was an emerging safety issue for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions that has 
been reflected in the final SmPC.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety database 
The critical data come from the NTM/MAC patients exposed during randomised comparative phases in 
INS-212 (223; since 1/224 was not treated) and TR02-112 (44). The total NTM/MAC patients exposed 
includes another 90 initially randomised to MDR alone in INS-212 who opted to enrol in INS-312 and 43 
from the initial placebo group in TR02-112 who opted to receive open-label ALIS in the extension phase. 
These numbers give a total of 400 NTM/MAC patients exposed to ALIS, to which the applicant added the 
4 patients who enrolled in the scintigraphy sub-study and continued on ALIS for 3 months. 
Safety in comparative phases 
When reviewing the tables, it is important to note that the applicant denotes 157 NTM patients as being 
in the “placebo” group. This number comprises 45 assigned to placebo (empty liposomes) in the 
randomised phase of TR02-112 (43 of whom later received ALIS in the open-label phase) plus 112 
patients in the MDR alone group in INS-212, 90 of whom opted to receive ALIS in INS-312. Thus, the AEs 
listed for the NTM “placebo” group would have been captured only during the comparative phases. In 
INS-212, any comparisons between treatments after month 8 are limited by the fact that only 65 in the 
ALIS group and 10 in the MDR group were allowed to continue on study.  
Adverse event profile 
The new data from INS-212 and from those who initiated ALIS in INS-312 support the previous 
conclusions drawn from TR02-112 on the generally poor tolerability of Arikayce. Much, but not all, of the 
burden of total AEs, AEs related to treatment and severe AEs reflects airway intolerance and elicitation of 
lung reactions. Most patients who felt unable to continue with ALIS treatment due to AEs withdrew during 
the first 6 months; hence there were few withdrawals due to AEs in patients previously exposed to ALIS 
in INS-212 who chose to enter INS-312. 
The additional data provide important information on the safety of longer-term exposure in NTM/MAC 
patients. The combined randomised and open-label phases of TR02-112 limited the maximum duration of 
exposure to 168 days. Some patients randomised to ALIS in INS-212 who switched to INS-312 at month 
8 could have received a total of up to 20 months. Those who were randomised to ALIS in INS-212 and had 
SCC by month 6 (hence received 12 months after achieving SCC at latest at month 4) could have received 
up to 16 months (although the median was 7.8 months). The additional data point to 
aminoglycoside-related AEs that were not evident during shorter-term exposures in TR02-112 but 
emerged with longer-term exposures to relatively low serum levels of amikacin in INS-212.  
Respiratory AEs 
ALIS was associated with much higher rates of cough, dysphonia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm and 
oropharyngeal pain as well as exacerbations compared to placebo or to MDR alone. There were also 
higher rates of haemoptysis with ALIS. These AEs also explained much of the difference between 
treatments in total rates for AEs considered treatment related. 
Allergic alveolitis was identified as a potential identified risk in the prior application. In the current 
application the applicant reports 13 cases in patients given ALIS (3.2%) and 2 in those who did not 
receive ALIS (1.3%). After correcting for duration of exposure, there remains an excess risk for 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 93/109 
 
 
  
ALIS-treated patients. Discontinuation of ALIS with/without use of steroids has resolved most cases. The 
overall data also suggest a higher rate of interstitial lung disease in ALIS patients. In the ALIS group, 15 
patients had an AE within the SMQ of ILD of which 12 were included in the 13 with allergic alveolitis.  
Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and other possible aminoglycoside issues 
Despite the low systemic exposures to amikacin, nephrotoxicity, tinnitus, hearing impairment and 
vestibular disorders were all more common with ALIS. Furthermore, neuromuscular AEs were common in 
ALIS-treated patients and it is possible that the higher rate of fatigue reported with ALIS could be 
associated with such issues. However, few patients had more than one AESI and generally few had 
overlapping events.  
Although systemic availability of amikacin may be low, a risk of aminoglycoside-related AEs associated 
with the long duration of exposure cannot be ruled out. The applicant has provided several analyses of 
exposure-adjusted AE rates, including AESIs. In most instances these analyses still show a higher risk for 
ALIS. It should be noted that the marked differences in demographics between NTM/MAC and CF patients 
means that results for the pooled safety population are not reassuring.  
In summary, current evidence points to a conclusion that chronic exposure (up to 20 months) to relatively 
low serum levels of amikacin constitutes a risk for developing aminoglycoside-related toxicities affecting 
the ear, kidney and neuromuscular system. The SmPC reflects the need to be vigilant for onset of such 
events and to consider stopping ALIS. 
Other AEs 
There were no cases of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) across the development 
programme but diarrhoea and nausea were considerably more common with ALIS, which may reflect the 
amount of amikacin that is deposited in the oropharynx and then swallowed. Low leukocyte counts 
occurred more often in NTM/MAC patients treated with ALIS (17; 4.2%) vs. controls (4; 2.5%). Similarly, 
low neutrophil counts were reported for 9 (2.2%) vs. 1 (0.6%).  
Hypersensitivity 
In order to assess AEs possibly representing hypersensitivity without the confounding of respiratory 
events, the SMQ of Hypersensitivity was re-analysed excluding terms in the SOC of Respiratory, Thoracic 
and Mediastinal Disorders. The incidence of hypersensitivity AEs was higher in the ALIS group (60 
patients; 14.9%) than in the placebo group (17, 10.8%). The difference was due to the incidence of AEs 
in the SOC of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders [42 (10.4%) patients in the ALIS group vs 11 
(7.0%) in the placebo group], which was driven by rash. Rash was reported in 14 (3.5%) patients in the 
ALIS group compared to 1 (0.6%) patient in the MDR group and was considered related to study 
treatment in 5 (1.2%) patients in the ALIS group and no patients in the MDR group. Rash has been listed 
as a common ADR in the SmPC.  
Furthermore, reflecting also the post-marketing safety data available, the SmPC reflects the potential 
risk for serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions to occur.  
Deaths and SAEs 
There was not an excess of deaths in patients exposed to ALIS. While the total SAE rates in NTM/MAC 
patients were higher for those exposed to ALIS, and while SAEs of the respiratory and infections SOCs 
predominated, most others occurred in very low numbers.  
Discontinuations and interruptions due to AEs  
Generally, the predominant AEs leading to discontinuations or interruptions were in the respiratory or 
infections SOCs or were potential aminoglycoside-related AEs. In the ALIS group, interruption of study 
treatment was reported in 110 (49%) of patients and interruption of ALIS was reported in 106 (48%) 
patients. Of patients with interruptions, 25 (23%) also had a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 94/109 
 
 
  
 
leading to discontinuation. This was not meaningfully different from the proportion of patients without 
drug interruption with a TEAE leading to discontinuation (22/113; 19%). If all-cause discontinuations are 
considered, patients without interruptions completed the treatment at a little higher rate (73%) vs those 
who interrupted the treatment due to TEAEs (58%). In the ALIS group, patients with a treatment 
interruption had lower rates of sustainable conversion (at 12 months of treatment post conversion) and 
durable conversion (at the 3-month follow-up visit) than the patients who did not interrupt treatment. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There are several concerns regarding the pulmonary (especially allergic alveolitis) and systemic toxicities 
(especially nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and effects on neuromuscular conditions) that may be due to 
chronic exposure to amikacin. Nevertheless, it was considered that NTM patients are managed in 
specialised centres and that adequate SmPC contraindications and warnings could suffice to alert 
physicians. Thus, it appeared that the safety profile is manageable subject to adequate patient 
supervision by specialists in this field, as advised in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the safety profile of Arikayce was taken into account when defining the final indication for 
use.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the presence of important identified risks specific to the inhalatory administration, the CHMP is 
of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Arikayce liposomal is needed, as it cannot follow 
the already existing entry for amikacin. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports 
for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did 
request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date 28.09.2018. The new EURD 
list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  Product information 
During assessment of the MAA, the CHMP requested a change of the invented name change as part of the 
Day 120 LoQ. As part of their answers to the D120 LoQ, the applicant changed the product name into 
‘Arikayce liposomal’, accordingly. This is in line with the EMA guidance and news from 31 July 2019.  
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Not applicable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed revised indication for Arikayce liposomal is for the treatment of non-tuberculous 
mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in adults with 
limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis. 
Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease caused by MAC is associated with productive cough, 
shortness of breath, fatigue, lung function decline and mortality. MAC has been implicated in 
complications of debilitating lung diseases such as bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). Post-menopausal Caucasian women without apparent predisposing conditions have 
been reported with increasing frequency to have pulmonary disease associated with MAC. 
The morbidity associated with NTM lung diseases is significant and has been reported in the literature to 
have a 5-year all-cause mortality risk ranging from 5.4% to 39.7%. In retrospective studies from the 
literature, the failure to achieve negative sputum cultures in patients with MAC lung disease has been 
associated with higher mortality rates. The 5-year mortality rate in one study was 33.3% for untreated 
MAC lung disease compared to 22.2% for treated MAC lung disease in patients with definite MAC lung 
disease. In the treated group, sputum culture conversion was 53.7% compared to 0% in the untreated 
group.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no approved treatments specifically for NTM or for the subset with MAC lung disease in the EU. 
Treatment guidelines have been developed by the ATS/IDSA and the British Thoracic Society, which have 
since been adopted by various countries globally and incorporated into local guidelines. The current 
treatment of NTM lung disease is primarily with a multi-drug regimen (MDR) based on the treatment of 
tuberculosis. The recommendation for patients with MAC is a 3-drug regimen including a macrolide, 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 100/109 
 
 
  
ethambutol and a rifamycin. Treatment is often for 12 to 18 months and selected based on clinical 
presentation and disease progression but may exceed 18 months. 
Specifically, the ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend a 3 times weekly regimen of clarithromycin (1,000 mg) 
or azithromycin (500 mg), rifampicin (600 mg) and ethambutol (25 mg/kg) for most patients with 
nodular/bronchiectatic MAC lung disease. For patients with fibrocavitary MAC lung disease or severe 
nodular/bronchiectatic disease, a daily regimen of clarithromycin (500 to 1,000 mg) or azithromycin (250 
mg), rifampicin (600 mg) or rifabutin (150 to 300 mg) and ethambutol (15 mg/kg) with consideration of 
3 times weekly IV amikacin or streptomycin early in therapy is recommended. Patients should continue 
treatment for 12 months after sputum culture conversion (SCC) has been achieved. 
The recently updated British Thoracic Society guideline on the management of NTM pulmonary disease 
provides treatment recommendations similar to the ATS/IDSA guidelines for the NTM species that most 
commonly fulfil the ATS/IDSA microbiologic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease within the UK, namely 
MAC, M. kansasii, M. malmoense, M. xenopi and M. abscessus complex. The guidance is based on five 
randomised controlled studies and several non-comparative studies involving individuals (not known to 
be HIV-positive) with MAC identified in the literature.  
More recently, guidance was published recommending addition of ALIS to treatment in patients who have 
failed to respond after 6 months.  
The stated aim of treatment is to achieve 12 months of negative sputum cultures while on treatment. SCC 
on treatment has been reported to occur in the majority of patients without fibrocavitary disease if they 
complete a full course of guideline-based treatment. In patients who experience treatment failure and/or 
have more severe underlying conditions such as fibrocavitary disease, it is more difficult to achieve SCC 
even with extended treatment, and alternative therapeutic options are limited.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant conducted 3 studies in patients with NTM or specifically with MAC. 
INS-212 is the single pivotal study to support the indication claimed since it was conducted in the target 
population of non-CF patients with chronic MAC lung disease and it prospectively followed-up patients 
eligible to stop all MAC treatment for a total of 12 months off therapy. 
The original protocol had a pre-defined primary endpoint of SCC (based on 3 consecutive monthly 
negative cultures) by month 6 on treatment. Whilst there are some data to suggest that patients with 
chronic MAC lung disease who achieve on-treatment SCC are less likely to die within prescribed periods 
than those who do not, the evidence is neither consistent nor conclusive. In contrast, if treatment 
achieves sustained SCC, such that it is considered possible to stop all anti-MAC therapy after completing 
treatment for 12 months post-SCC, this would be a clear benefit to the patient since a) no further 
MAC-associated lung damage would be expected and b) the burden and side effects of treatment would 
be removed. Therefore, a separate statistical analysis plan was developed for the EU, following CHMP 
advice that the primary endpoint should be sustained SCC documented at least 3 months after stopping 
all treatment.  
Other design issues that were not considered optimal by CHMP include the following: 
o 
o 
INS-212 was open-label and the possibility that the open-label design influenced the discontinuation 
or AE reporting rates cannot be dismissed. 
Patients were discontinued at month 8 if they had not had SCC confirmed by month 6. This means 
that the comparisons of longer-term and post-treatment sustained SCC rates between the initial 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 101/109 
 
 
  
 
randomised treatment groups can be made only between the 65 ALIS and 10 control group patients 
who achieved SCC by month 6. Whilst the primary analysis is based on the entire ITT population, as 
advised by CHMP, the interpretation of this analysis rests on the assumption that the post-treatment 
sustained SCC rate in the patients initially assigned to MDR alone would have been zero if they had 
continued on MDR alone. Overall, in a population that had mostly received prior unsuccessful 
treatment for MAC for several years, and given the actual results for the 10 control group patients 
retained in the study after month 8, it is reasonable to assume that the post-treatment sustained 
SCC rate on MDR alone would have been zero or, at least, negligible. 
o  The definitions applied to on-treatment and post-treatment sustained SCC and relapse, which 
allowed for some broth cultures to have been positive, were not considered appropriate. Any positive 
culture (agar or broth) post SCC should be counted as a positive for the visit at which the sample was 
obtained since the result is evidence of residual MAC in the airways.  
o  Although patients were to have received at least 6 months of treatment for MAC, this could have 
consisted of only two agents and it could have been stopped < 12 months before screening. Overall, 
the study population was not confined to patients who had failed to respond to what could be 
considered an adequate treatment regimen for MAC and could be regarded as a mixture of 
inadequately treated (some of whom may have been non-adherent) and recalcitrant patients. 
o  There was no attempt to “optimise” the background multidrug (MDR) regimen at baseline.  
INS-312 was an uncontrolled study in which patients enrolled into INS-212 who had failed to achieve SCC 
by month 6 or had relapsed within that period could elect to receive open-label ALIS for up to 12 months. 
The aim was to analyse safety and there was follow-up for only one month off-treatment. This study 
described SCC rates in those who persisted with ALIS or switched to ALIS but does not contribute to the 
overall understanding of the clinical benefit of adding ALIS to MDR. 
TR02-112 did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the possible clinical benefit of ALIS. For example, the 
duration of the double-blind randomised phase was 84 days, after which patients could elect to receive 
open-label ALIS for another 84 days of treatment maximum and follow-up was not planned to formally 
assess efficacy. The study did provide placebo-controlled safety data over 12 weeks and it showed no 
clear microbiological effect or other benefit in patients with CF or species other than MAC. INS-212 
excluded patients with non-MAC infections and those with CF. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
INS-212 met the pre-defined enrolment target to address the FDA-recommended primary endpoint. 
Based on the FDA-recommended primary endpoint, SCC by month 6 on treatment was achieved by 
65/224 (29%) in the ALIS+MDR group and by 10/112 (8.9%) in the MDR alone group, a difference which 
reached significance. Only these 75 patients with SCC by month 6 then remained on study beyond month 
8 and were to receive 12 months of treatment after SCC had been achieved.  
At the time of the month 3 post-treatment visit (the pre-defined EU primary endpoint), and based on the 
applicant’s definitions of continued negative cultures, sustained SCC (based on the ITT population, 
assuming zero for all 112 MDR alone patients if they had been retained on study) had been documented 
in 36/224 (16.1%) ALIS and 0/112 (0%) MDR alone patients, which reached significance. Overall, this 
rate means that ~1/6 patients who commenced ALIS had sustained SCC at month 3 off treatment. All of 
the 36 ALIS patients considered by the applicant to have post-treatment sustained SCC had initially 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 102/109 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
achieved SCC by 3 months on treatment and 32/36 had done so by month 2, which suggests that those 
who respond early are most likely to have a lasting benefit. 
The findings also mean that 29 ALIS and all 10 MDR alone patients with on-treatment SCC by month 6 did 
not sustain SCC at month 3 off treatment. Furthermore, most of those who did not sustain SCC at month 
3 off treatment had become culture positive while still on treatment, i.e. at month 12 post-SCC there were 
41 ALIS and 3 MDR alone patients who still had SCC (44/75 of those with SCC by month 6). 
In the final CSR, complete data are reported for the post-treatment follow-up visit at month 12. According 
to the applicant’s rules, 30/224 (13.4%) in the ALIS + MDR arm vs. 0% in the MDR alone arm had 
sustained SCC conversion, which equates with about 1/7 of total patients assigned to ALIS. 
INS-312 was uncontrolled and cannot support any conclusion drawn on clinical benefit.  
However, it provided additional information on tolerability and SCC rates over time that added to 
information supporting the SmPC advice regarding when to consider stopping ALIS due to it being very 
unlikely that the individual patient will benefit from continuing treatment.  
Firstly, most patients who cannot tolerate Arikayce will withdraw in the first 6 months. Thus, only 3/73 
(4%) patients already exposed to ALIS in INS-212 discontinued from ALIS in INS-312 due to AEs vs. 
20/90 (22%) not previously exposed. Far fewer patients previously exposed to ALIS achieved SCC in 
INS-312 while the rate of achieving SCC by month 6 on ALIS in previously unexposed patients was 24/90 
(26.7%), very similar to the rate (29%) observed in the ALIS arm in INS-212.  
Secondly, a small number of patients randomised to ALIS in INS-212 achieved SCC for the first time 
during INS-312. However, at end of treatment in INS-312 6/73 (8.2%) prior ALIS vs. 18/90 (20%) prior 
MDR patients had achieved and sustained SCC on treatment. There were no post-treatment visits beyond 
month 13 so the study cannot support the primary endpoint in INS-212. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is no good rationale for the daily dose or for once daily dosing. Since PK-PD analyses cannot be 
applied to dose-finding in this situation, the only way to select a dose would be from dose-finding studies, 
which would likely have to rely on an on-treatment SCC rate. The 12-month duration of treatment that 
was employed in INS-212 and is recommended in the SmPC after confirmed SCC is achieved is in line with 
recommendations from professional bodies. 
Whilst the applicant reported a continued SCC in 36/224 and 30/224 vs. 0/112 at the 3-month and 
12-month post-treatment visits, these rates are based on the applicant’s counting schema, which is not 
entirely agreed. The applicant provided on request the serial culture data for 44 patients – 41 initially 
assigned to ALIS and 3 initially assigned to MDR alone – who had achieved SCC (as defined in the 
protocol) on treatment so continued in the study on their assigned treatment after month 8 and were solid 
culture negative at month 12. Of these 44, two were broth culture positive at month 12 and 6 did not have 
a result. Also, at end of treatment, one ALIS patient was solid culture positive and one MDR alone patient 
had no result.   
Importantly, not all of these 44 patients had MAC cultured from their baseline (as opposed to screening 
visit) sputum specimen. There were 9 ALIS and 2 MDR patients with completely negative cultures on Day 
1. Of these subjects, 6/9 ALIS and one of the 2 MDR patients had no post-baseline positive solid or broth 
cultures. It cannot be ruled out that on-study treatment with ALIS+MDR or MDR alone made no difference 
to these 7 patients, leaving 35 and 1 that can be assessed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 103/109 
 
 
  
 
 
Focussing on the 35 ALIS patients for whom an on-treatment SCC could therefore be assessed, and 
counting any solid or broth culture positive after SCC occurred as failure, there were 30 (13.4%) with 
sustained SCC at month 3 post-treatment. Similarly, counting any positive as failure, there were 25 
(11%) patients with SCC through to Month 12 post-treatment.   
In summary, whilst the applicant reports a post-treatment sustained SCC rate of 36/224 (16%) at month 
3 and 30/224 (13.4%) at month 12, the Rapporteur’s findings indicate rates of 30/224 (13.4%) and 
25/224 (11%) at respective visits. Whilst one could argue about how certain patients have been counted 
by the applicant or by the Rapporteur, it remains the case that, at best, ~1/6 to ~1/10 patients who ever 
start on Arikayce might have a sustained SCC on treatment that is maintained after stopping all NTM 
treatment. Thus, the treatment benefit is, at best, modest.  
Success rates were comparable for M. avium and M. intracellulare and, perhaps, may be lower for the 
unspeciated NTMs that were considered to fall within the MAC complex. Also, success rates were 
comparable for the US and Japan, where the majority was enrolled. In Europe, <10% of 48 patients had 
a sustained conversion compared to ~40% of the 24 enrolled in Oceania. However, these differences may 
have arisen by chance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The critical safety data come from the NTM/MAC patients exposed during randomised comparative phases 
in INS-212 (223; since 1/224 was not treated) and TR02-112 (44). The total NTM/MAC patients exposed 
includes another 90 initially randomised to MDR alone in INS-212 who opted to enrol in INS-312 and 43 
from the initial placebo group in TR02-112 who opted to receive open-label ALIS in the extension phase. 
When including the scintigraphy sub-study patients, a total of 404 NTM/MAC patients were exposed to 
ALIS but the minority have been exposed for >8 months.  
The data demonstrate the poor tolerability of Arikayce. Much, but not all, of the burden of total AEs, AEs 
related to treatment and severe AEs reflects airway intolerance and most patients who felt unable to 
continue with ALIS treatment due to AEs withdrew during the first few months on treatment. The 
additional data also provide important information on the safety of longer-term exposure of up to 20 
months, which allows for an evaluation of the risk of aminoglycoside-related AEs that may emerge during 
chronic exposure to relatively low serum levels of amikacin.  
Respiratory AEs 
ALIS was associated with much higher rates of cough, dysphonia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm and 
oropharyngeal pain as well as exacerbations compared to placebo or to MDR alone. There were also 
higher rates of haemoptysis with ALIS. These AEs also explained much of the difference between 
treatments in total rates for AEs considered treatment-related. 
Allergic alveolitis was documented in 13 patients given ALIS (3.2%) and 2 who did not receive ALIS 
(1.3%). After correcting for duration of exposure, there remains an excess risk for ALIS-treated patients. 
Discontinuation of ALIS and use of steroids has apparently resolved most cases. The time to onset of 
allergic alveolitis was variable but 8/13 cases had onset within the first 6 months. 
Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and other possible aminoglycoside issues 
Whilst most patients have relatively low plasma amikacin exposures when compared to parenteral 
dosing, there is chronic exposure to the agent during inhalational treatment. Nephrotoxicity, tinnitus, 
hearing impairment and vestibular disorders were all more common with ALIS. Furthermore, 
neuromuscular AEs were common in ALIS-treated patients and it is possible that the higher rate of fatigue 
reported with ALIS could be associated with such issues. The applicant clarified that most patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/473660/2020 
Page 104/109 
 
 
  
 
these potentially aminoglycoside-related AEs had only one such event. There were too few PK samples 
obtained to be able to investigate the relationship between such events and serum amikacin. 
The applicant provided several analyses of exposure-adjusted AE rates, including AESIs. In most 
instances, these analyses still show a higher risk for ALIS. There was no clear relationship found between 
serum creatinine and any specific concomitant medications. However, it should be noted that the median 
(range) creatinine clearance in patients with NTM was 86.3 (63.3 to 140) mL/min/1.73 m2 in TR02-112 
and 88.4 (57.4 to 124) mL/min/1.73 m2 in INS-212. 
In summary, chronic exposure (up to 20 months) to relatively low serum levels of amikacin constitutes a 
risk for developing aminoglycoside-related toxicities. 
Other AEs 
Low leukocyte counts occurred more often in NTM/MAC patients treated with ALIS (17; 4.2%) vs. controls 
(4; 2.5%). Similarly, low neutrophil counts were reported for 9 (2.2%) vs. 1 (0.6%).  
The assessment of AEs possibly representing hypersensitivity to amikacin is complicated by the fact that 
some respiratory AES could represent airway irritation rather than true hypersensitivity (e.g. 
bronchospasm). However, an analysis of non-respiratory AEs that could represent hypersensitivity 
reactions showed rates of 14.9% in the ALIS group vs. 10.8% in the placebo group, with a difference that 
reflected rash, which was reported in 14 (3.5%) patients in the ALIS group compared to 1 (0.6%) patient 
in the MDR group. Rash was considered related to study treatment in 5 (1.2%) patients in the ALIS group 
and no patients in the MDR group and it has been added as a common ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, based also on post-marketing experience, it was apparent that severe systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions can occur during use of ALIS, which has been reflected in the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The CSR for TR02-112, where treatment with ALIS or placebo was fixed at a maximum of 84 days, 
presented the safety data separately for the double-blind randomised phase. These data clearly showed 
that amikacin was per se a bronchial irritant. In INS-212, any comparisons between treatments after 
month 8 are limited by the fact that only 65 in the ALIS group and 10 in the MDR group were allowed to 
continue on study. On request, separate tabulations were provided for AEs for the ALIS+MDR vs. MDR 
alone groups only for the first 8 months of the study. This comparison strongly underlined the poor airway 
tolerability of Arikayce but it also showed higher rates of AEs with Arikayce in many other SOCs and for 
multiple specific non-respiratory PTs. 
There have not been any cases of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) across the 
development programme but diarrhoea and nausea were considerably more common with ALIS, which 
may reflect the amount of amikacin that is deposited in the oropharynx and then swallowed.  
Thus far, there has not been an excess of deaths in patients exposed to ALIS. There were higher rates for 
SAEs considered related to assigned treatment in NTM/MAC patients, mostly driven by respiratory events.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There are no agents specifically licensed in the EU for treatment of chronic MAC lung disease but agents 
licensed or at least used to treat tuberculosis are widely used in combination. There is significant 
morbidity and mortality and some publications report that the latter is reduced by treatments that 
achieve SCC. However, the benefit of achieving on-treatment SCC remains uncertain and unquantified. In 
contrast, if SCC is sustained throughout and after stopping treatment there is a clear benefit to the patient 
since no further lung damage due to MAC would be expected and the burden of MAC treatment regimens 
is removed. 
Current evidence suggests that approximately 1/8 patients who commence ALIS in addition to MDR will 
achieve and sustain SCC at month 3 after completing 12 months of treatment post-SCC. However, the 
rate may drop to 1/10 by month 12 post-treatment. Some of these patients may have a relapse while 
others may have a reinfection. It is not surprising that adding a single inhaled agent to patients who have 
failed to respond to prior treatment (but for a range of reasons) is not dramatically effective. 
Nevertheless, in a population that has already failed to respond to guideline-recommended first-line 
regimens, and in light of the serious nature of uncontrolled NTM, this modest benefit may be of 
importance to a select patient subset.   
Treatment with Arikayce is accompanied by significant local tolerability and systemic safety issues. In the 
first months of treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs or patient decision is considerable. Thus, the 
current safety data also support use of Arikayce only in a very restricted patient group and under careful 
supervision of experts in the field of NTM management. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Taking into account the modest efficacy of Arikayce in NTM/MAC patients and the safety profile, it was 
concluded that the benefit-risk relationship could be favourable only in patients who have limited 
treatment options as reflected in the final indication for use. Furthermore, usage should be under 
supervision of experts in the field and clear stopping rules are appropriate for section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Lung squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 2 of 120 animals at study termination in the high dose 
group in the non-clinical carcinogenicity study conducted in rat. The applicant suggests that this finding is 
of questionable clinical relevance. However, the non-clinical data available are not sufficient to conclude 
on the clinical relevance of these findings and it is not foreseen that additional non-clinical studies will 
clarify this risk. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Arikayce is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Arikayce liposomal is favourable in the following indication: 
treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by Mycobacterium avium 
Complex (MAC) in adults with limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.1).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH has developed a patient alert card which will be included in the outer carton. The wording of the 
alert card is part of the labelling - please see Annex III, A. LABELLING.  
The purpose of the alert card is to inform patients that the use of Arikayce liposomal may be associated 
with the development of allergic alveolitis. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable.

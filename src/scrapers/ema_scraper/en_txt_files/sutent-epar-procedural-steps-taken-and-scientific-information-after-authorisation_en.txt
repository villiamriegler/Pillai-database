the first-line, bevacizumab-refractory, and cytokine-
refractory treatment settings in 5,739 patients, of whom 
807 (14%) were treated for ≥ 2 years up to 6 years. In the 
807 patients who received long-term sunitinib treatment, 
most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred 
initially in the first 6 months–1 year and then were stable 
or decreased in frequency over time, with the exception of 
hypothyroidism, which gradually increased over time, with 
new cases occurring over the 6 year period. Prolonged 
treatment with sunitinib did not appear to be associated 
with new types of TRAEs.

Phase 1/2 study examining the safety/tolerability, the 
maximum tolerated dose, and the antitumour activity of 
sunitinib in combination with gefitinib in subjects with 
MRCC. The PK of gefitinib (250 mg daily) and sunitinib 
(37.5 mg [Cohort 1, n=4] or 50 mg [Cohort 2, n=7] daily 
on a 4-weeks on followed by 2 weeks-off schedule) when 
co-administered was evaluated as a secondary study 
objective. Changes in sunitinib pharmacokinetic parameters 
were of no clinical significance and did not indicate any 
drug-drug interactions; however, considering the relatively 
low number of subjects (i.e. N=7+4) and the moderate-
large interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic 
parameters, caution needs to be taken when interpreting 
the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction findings from 
this study.

Overall, patients with primary Kit exon 9 mutation had 
longer OS and PFS and higher rate of response compared 
to patients with other mutations. However, this study 
suffered of the limitations typical of retrospective essays, 
i.e restricted sample size, lack of availability of tissue and 
plasma samples at repeated time points and inter-
laboratory variability (mutational status was examined at 
local laboratories). 
No changes to the product information are warranted. The

review of MAH-sponsored nonclinical studies, and cases 
from the MAH’s clinical trials and postmarketing reports. 
One cholecystitis sunitinib-related event was reported in 
the pooled dataset of pivotal studies and supported the 
MAH’s proposal to include “Cholecystitis” in Table 1 of the 
SmPC Section 4.8 with a frequency uncommon.  
Sixty-seven cholecystitis cases, accounting for 68 events, 
have been reported in the sunitinib global safety database.

Overall, sunitinib treatment may be associated with 
cholecystitis, including acalculous cholecystitis and 
emphysematous cholecystitis. In clinical registrational 
studies, the incidence of cholecystitis considered related to 
sunitinib treatment was 0.1%. Post-marketing cases of 
cholecystitis have been reported.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II and PL 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Sutent continues 
to be favourable.  
The CHMP is however of the opinion that one additional 
five-year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance 
grounds is required. The latest extension of indication of 
Sutent for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, 
well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours with 
disease progression in adults has been granted recently 
(EMEA/H/C/687/II/21, Commission Decision 29 November 
2010). In order to definitely confirm a Marketing 
Authorisation with unlimited validity, a larger post 
marketing experience is considered necessary, in particular 
as certain safety concerns as discussed in the assessment 
of the renewal and PSUR are under continuous surveillance. 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit

60 rats/sex for low and mid dose) were given sunitinib daily 
via oral gavage in a cycle of 28  days of dosing followed by 
a 7-day treatment free period at doses of 0, 0.33, 1.0, or 
3.0 mg/kg/day for at least 104 weeks. Toxicokinetic 
parameters have been assessed by one single test of 
plasma levels at week 26. Administration of sunitinib 
resulted in an increased incidence of pheochromocytomas 
and hyperplasia in the adrenal medulla of male rats given 3 
mg/kg/day following >1 year of dosing ( 7.8 times the AUC 
in patients administered the recommended daily dose 
[RDD]). Brunner's glands carcinoma occurred in the 
duodenum at ?1 mg/kg/day in females and at 3

evident in the glandular stomach at 3 mg/kg/day in males, 
which occurred at ?0.9, 7.8 and 7.8 times the AUC in

refractory MRCC studies; in 61 patients (16%) on sunitinib 
and three patients (<1%) in the IFN-  arm in the 
treatment-naïve MRCC study. Baseline laboratory 
measurement of thyroid function is recommended in all 
patients. During sunitinib treatment, routine monitoring of 
thyroid function should be performed every 3 months. In 
addition, patients should be observed closely for signs and 
symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during treatment, and 
patients who develop any signs and/or symptoms 
suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory 
testing of thyroid function performed as clinically indicated. 
Patients who develop thyroid dysfunction should be treated 
as per standard medical practice. 
Although most of the reported hemorrhagic events were of 
grade 1 or 2 and mainly due to lack of control of the 
underlying conditions (metastatic disease, uncontrolled 
hypertension and thrombocytopenia), the risk of 
hemorrhagic AEs with sunitinb is not neglectable (26% in

patients treated with sunitinib, Ayllon, Prog Urol 2010). 
Therefore, the adverse drug reaction "haemoptysis" has 
been added to SmPC section 4.8 as well as in the PL with 
the frequency "uncommon".  
The terms "anaemia" and "oedema peripheral" were 
already listed in the SmPC section 4.8 as very common 
adverse reactions. The incidence of anaemia ranged from 
12.5% (MRCC) to 19.5% (GIST) in clinical trials. The 
incidence of oedema (oedema, oedema peripheral and 
oedema face) ranged from 13.4% (GIST) to 15.3% 
(MRCC). Most events of anaemia and oedema were mild to 
moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2). However, the 
information in the SmPC has been amended to inform that 
anaemia has been observed to occur early as well as late 
during treatment with sunitinib; Grade 3 and 4 cases have 
been reported. 
Furthermore, the 3/X methodology in accordance with the 
SmPC guideline was applied for the post-marketing

Study A6181004 was a phase II, randomized, double Blind, 
reported in 23.7% of patients receiving sunitinib and in 
6.9% of patients receiving IFN-?, However, the 
discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 20% for 
sunitinib and 23% for IFN-?. The adverse events reported 
in sunitinib-treated subjects were tolerable and 
manageable by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or 
standard medical therapy. Overall, the safety data are 
consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib, and no 
new safety risks were identified.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
placebo-controlled study of SU011248 in the treatment of 
patients with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec)-resistant 
or intolerant malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour). 
The final analysis of Study A6181004 re-affirmed the 
results from the previously submitted interim analysis. The 
study demonstrated that sunitinib treatment improved TTP 
by more than 4-fold (26.6 vs. 6.4 weeks, p<0.001) 
compared with placebo. This resulted in an approximate 3-
fold reduction in the relative risk of disease progression in 
subjects with GIST. In the final analysis median TTP for the 
sunitinib group is 26.6 weeks, with a range: 16 to 32.1 
weeks. The 16 weeks are closer to the median TTP of 
patients in the placebo arm, i.e. 6.4 weeks. This means 
that there are patients whose disease is effectively kept 
under control by sunitinib and other patients that are 
possibly exposed to toxicity without any significant benefit. 
Adverse events reported in sunitinib-treated subjects were 
generally tolerable and manageable through dosing 
interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard supportive 
medical therapies. The final analyses of safety are 
consistent with the safety profile observed at the interim

analysis; there have been no new safety risks identified in 
this study. 
Due to the lack of validated predictive markers and the 
significant difference in TTP (primary objective in this 
study) it is difficult to deny an option to patients who 
progress on imatinib. At the same time the MAH is strongly 
encouraged to further identify and validate predictive 
factors of response to sunitinib. The MAH has made a 
commitment in this regard.

angioedema was conducted by the MAH for the period 26 
January 2006 to 31 July 2008. A total of 69 cases 
(containing 86 relevant events) reported angioedema and 
related events. Regarding angioedema in particular, forty-
five cases reported 50 events including facial, lip, laryngeal 
and/or tongue swelling/edema events. Thirty-five events 
were considered serious and the remaining 15 events were 
considered non serious. Seven cases reported 
Hypersensitivity (3), Anaphylactic reaction (2), and Drug 
hypersensitivity (2). Six of the seven events were 
considered serious. This case series suggests that serious 
hypersensitivity reactions, particularly angioedema, may 
occur with sunitinib therapy. 
During routine data mining of the safety database for 
sunitinib, the adverse event "Fistula" was identified as a 
Page 27/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
signal of disproportional reporting. The subsequent search 
in the postmarketing safety database for the period 26 
January 2006 to 31 July 2008 revealed a total of 34 
reported cases of all types of fistula. The most common PTs 
were Anal fistula (5), Enterocutaneous fistula (5), and 
Gastrointestinal fistula (5). Although many of the reported 
fistulae cases involved patients with known contributing 
factors (i.e. adjacent malignancy, surgery, pre-existing 
conditions), there were several cases which described a 
close temporal association between sunitinib use and 
fistulae which did not identify an adjacent risk factor.  
During the assessment the CHMP considered that in almost 
all the cases of ADRs (both angioedema and fistula) the 
treatment with Sutent was completely interrupted in order 
to recover the symptoms. Therefore, information regarding 
the management of these ADRs has been added to SPC 
section 4.4 together with the update of the table presenting 
Adverse Reactions reported through post-marketing 
experience.

PSUR, to update the warnings regarding pulmonary events, 
haematological events, renal function and venous 
thrombolic events in section 4.4 of the SPC, and to add the 
ADR 'pneumonia' to secton 4.8 of the SPC. In addition, the 
MAH takes the opportunity to update the contact details of

Revised wording in section 4.4 of the SPC: 
Haematological events 
Decreased absolute neutrophil counts of grade 3 and 4 
severity were reported in 10% and 1.7% of patients on the 
phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 16% and 1.6% of 
patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively. 
Decreased platelet counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were 
reported in 3.7% and 0.4% of patientson the phase 3 GIST 
study, respectively, and in 8.2% and 1.1% of patients on 
the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively. The above events 
were not cumulative, were typically reversible and 
generally did not result in treatment discontinuation. None 
of these events in the phase 3 studies were fatal, but rare 
fatal haematological events have been reported through 
post-marketing experience.

Complete blood counts should be performed at the 
beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving 
treatment with Sutent. 
Venous Thromboembolic Events: 
Treatment-related venous thromboembolic events were 
reported in approximately 1.0% of patients with solid 
tumours who received Sutent on clinical trials, including 
GIST and MRCC. 
Seven patients (3%) on Sutent and none on placebo in a 
phase 3 GIST study experienced venous thromboembolic 
events; five of the seven were Grade 3 deep venous 
thromboses (DVT) and two were Grade 1 or 2. Four of 
these seven GIST patients discontinued treatment following 
first observation of DVT.

Hepatic impairment: 
Sunitinib and its primary metabolite are mainly metabolized 
by the liver.  Systemic exposures after a single dose of 
Sutent were similar in subjects with mild or moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function. Sutent was not 
studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic 
impairment. 
Studies in cancer patients have excluded patients with ALT 
or AST >2.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) or, if due to 
liver metastasis, > 5.0 x ULN.  
No dose adjustment is recommended when administering 
Sutent to patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class 
A and B) hepatic impairment.  
Pancreatitis has been observed rarely (<1%) in patients 
receiving Sutent for GIST or Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma. Hepatic failure was observed in <1% of solid 
tumor patients treated with Sutent. If symptoms of 
pancreatitis or hepatic failure are present, patients should 
have Sutent discontinued and be provided with appropriate 
supportive care. 
QT Interval prolongation: 
QT interval prolongation was investigated in a trial in 24 
patients, aged 20-87 years, with advanced malignancies. At 
approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, Sutent has 
been shown to prolong the QTcF interval (Frederica's 
Correction). There were no patients with greater than
